    "text": "Ok, so it's not perfection, but I have to give it 5 stars based on what I see passes as a \"4 star\" place for breakfast/brunch on the Strip. Eat blows them out of the water.  Service is friendly and efficient; helpful with a smile. What more do you need?  Ambiance is cute, mildly hipster, but nothing over the top. Just a bunch of people digging good food.  As for the food, the standouts for us were the Truffled Egg Sandwich and the pancakes. The pancake had a sublime lightness to them with a perfectly thin crispy exterior. Seriously one of the best I've had in a long time. Potatoes on the side were great as well. Other food was less than amazing (Chicken Fried Steak tasted good, but was just a little over done and the steak wasn't pounded quite thin enough, and Chilaquiles just lacked some oomph), but still good for the eating.  Well worth the trip to downtown LV. Afterwards, we walked through the Container Park right across the street. Neat stuff.",

    "text": "Friends and I were in Vegas for the RiSE festival and EAT was recommended to us. we tried to go for lunch but it was a 45 minute wait so we decided to check it out for breakfast. I ordered the Egg Truffle sandwich. The sandwich was really tasty with a great flavor and the dish was filling with the potatoes. I added avocado to the sandwich which was another $2.00 but gave it a great extra something.  The coffee was good too.  Even though the place was busy for a Sunday morning (10 a.m.) the service was good as the wait staff was attentive. I would  definitely recommend this place.  The place is first come, first serve so unfortunately no reservations so if you are going to EAT come early for lunch unless you don't mind waiting 45 minutes.",

WTF!..Talk about False advertising. ..Then what breakfast place worth its weight in gold doesn't serve freshly squeezed orange juice..Especially after a long night of dancing and drinking. THIS is essential. .. Small yet quait with indoor/outside seating and decent decor and ambiance but who really cares about that at breakfast. ..Good food, Freshly squeezed juice options and great service is how we judge our Breakfast  spots. Whats saves this joint is The Food...fresh ingredients and righteous spicing are key.. So if you're ok with decent service, no freshly squeezed oj but good food (without the beignets) Definitely give this place a try, at least once..",

    "text": "Had a chance to drop by here the Saturday after Mother's day. I'm guessing since everyone had been out to eat the week before it was less crowded than usual. Parking is metered (boo!) but there was plenty of it across the street and in the surrounding area. The ambience is very hipster, but also casual.  There was a big selection of food for brunch (although I do not think I saw anything vegan- I would call and check first) and there were NO CHANGES allowed to the menu. I don't know if this is all day, or just a brunch thing. For someone with allergies I would call ahead. The deviled eggs are apparently very popular and deep fried. I can vouch for their cinnamon biscuits, which are basically bisquick biscuits (to me) with some cinnamon and fruit preserves on top, the latin inspired eggs with salsa, beans, and bananas, and the ABLT sandwich. All were delicious.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so. It is obvious, but not unfriendly obvious, that they are trying to turn tables very quickly. Food comes out in 5-7 minutes and the check comes not soon after. If you are looking for a leisurely brunch this is not the place. There were no lines but I imagine on heavy days the fast turn around is nice for people who don't want to wait in line a long time.",

They do not do any substitutions or modifications and that is clearly outlined on the menu.  One awkward moment was when one of the members of our party asked if her sandwich can be cut in half as to be easier to handle.  The waitperson politely said they can't, but they could bring a knife for us to do it.  I understand the modifications and substitutions part, but I think not cutting a large sandwich is a bit over the top.  Having said that, we will be back though.  Fun vibe.",

We were sat immediately, and our drink order was taken in moments. We had the perfect amount of time to peruse the surprisingly diverse menu and when our drinks arrived, the gal who delivered them took our order to streamline the process.  Speaking of our beverages: best cup of coffee I've had in a long long time! Mothership Roasters just gained a new supporter! When I asked another employee about it, she was friendly and knowledgeable. She referred me to where I could purchase it for home (there at eat. or Sunrise Coffee) and showed genuine interest in my curiosity. The OJ was also exceptionally good, the fiancee could not stop raving about it.  Food arrives very quickly and very hot- exactly how I want my breakfast! I had shrimp and grits which were so good I almost cannot even put it into words.. creamy grits, perfectly over easy eggs, crispy mapled bacon, tender butterflyed shrimps, savory creamy sauce and fresh lively pico de gallo. I almost cleared my plate, which is a huge feat for me. Man had chilequiles, with fresh crispy tortilla chips, delicious vegetables and fluffy eggs. The habanero sausage was the best part for sure, though it was all amazing.  Not too pricey, worth every penny no question. We will be going back and often!",

The late night search for tomorrows breakfast lead me to yelp and yelp let me to \"EAT\".... I offered this up to my crew for vote and we were all in!  So we arrive in this seedy little area in Vegas. Trestaurantunt is located underneath a old apartment building. Aside from the rest of the building the place is really nice. Its modern with black modern sign and concrete floors and lots cool kidkid type furniture etc. it has a buzz about it like its got a local following. Justeppingnbg in the door made me feel like we were experiencing a insider place locals are enjoying. I am up for that type thing.....  I ordered the Posole, this is a great hangover meal! Just the smell was good enough to pull me in. It has all the favorites Mexicanxican Posole would have, hominy, pork, broth etc. It was good. Although it was served in a shallow bowl so I would have appreciated to have a little more.  My wife ordered a wedge salad topped with huge shrimp. Her meal looked awesome. The shrimpCajuna cajun type seasoning that was spicy. It was good. the blue cheese dressing was excellent as well.   My mom ordered a uneventful chicken pot wasn'tShe wasnt impressed, And I trust judgmentjudgement.  Very difficulty to get a refill on my coffee. I had to approach the kitchen counter to get coffee.don'twice.  I dont think I will go here again, but if I \"end up here\" I know what to avoid and I know to expect to get my own coffee.",

My issue with eat. however, is how unwelcome I feel when I go there. I work nearby and have stopped by for lunch on a handful of occasions, never really loving the service, but my visit yesterday was the last straw. First, our table was given away after the hostess failed to step outside to call my name (the waiting area inside was full). Second, our order was never put in by the waitress and it wasn't until another server checked on us 30 minutes later that the food was finally prepared. Finally, when the food did arrive, one of our orders was wrong. At that point, we had both already gone over our allotted lunch hour, so my companion gave up and just ate what she had received.   The server who noticed we never got food did apologize for the issue, but the original waitress who took the order never bothered to come by to apologize. Over an hour and half after our arrival we finally paid and left. I'll probably avoid going back with co-workers in the future - I can't keep taking such long lunch breaks. And I can't justify paying so much on a lunch at a place that doesn't seem to appreciate my business.",

The chicken sausage is a bit sweeter than I'd like but that's more due to personal taste preference than anything wrong with the food. The full flavored coffee was aromatic and more importantly brewed correctly, not burned. The staff is friendly though I never got a water refill, hence the 4 star vs 5. We went early Sunday morning so the street parking isn't an issue. Nice thing about weekends and holidays, free street parking! Overall, it was a delicious breakfast in a cute cafe.",

We ordered the cinnamon biscuits which came drizzled in their homemade jam and fruit. We weren't actually too impressed with this dish, the biscuits were a little dry but the sauce made up for it. What was amazing was our main entree. We ordered two eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon. Perfection. The potatoes were amazing. I can only dream of a way to recreate their parsley potatoes. Even the toast was way more delicious than regular toast and I can't discover why. The bacon was also delicious. Something else amazing was their specialty honey. I could drink it for days.   Our waiter however was a bit rude, he made rude comments to a friend of ours for ordering two appetizers in lieu of an entree. Taking off one star for that and the dry biscuits.

    "text": "My coworkers and I wanted to find a place to have breakfast but also have a business meeting.  I suggested Eat. Located in the newly upgraded downtown Fremont East Community, this is one of the first new restaurants to open and it still thrives today after its opening three years ago.  It's been a year since I've been to this restaurant, and many of my coworkers have never been there.  I was so happy my coworkers was to experience the phenomenon that is from Chef Natalie's creative menu and her \"stick to your ribs\" hearty breakfasts.   My only concern was wait time to get in...good thing we came early.  We arrived at 9am and already the restaurant was 2/3rds full.   We were seated quickly and met up with a hostess who offered us drinks and the special of the day: scotch eggs.  Of course we ordered the scotch eggs over a small stack of pancakes as an appetizer, along with the cinnamon biscuits topped with fruit compote, & deep fried deviled eggs!  I ordered my usual favorite, chicken fried steak and eggs with country style potato hash.  Note: all eggs are prepared to preference.  Other plates ordered was the corned beef and hash, shrimp and grits and the steak, egg avocado breakfast sandwich.  The food was amazing as the first time I had come previously. It was not a disappointment!  The portions are huge!  Warning, this is NOT for the dainty eater, you need to come hungry. However, they do have to go boxes if needed!   If you're in downtown Fremont, stop by this place for a fulfilling eating experience, then walk it off while touring the shops at container park or go have fun in the casinos on Fremont experience.  Bon appetite!  :)",

I probably wouldn't get the Chicken Fried Steak again though, as it gets to be too heavy after a while. It felt like eating a breaded beef patty.   Over all, a great experience and will come back again to try their Deep Fried Devil Eggs and their Cinnamon Biscuits with Strawberry Compote!",

From there the whole experience went downhill fast.    1. There was a glass that was clearly dirty (a ton of lipstick on it). 2. We weren't told that they were out of sourdough for their BLTA's so they put it on brioche (not great) and no apology. 3. They asked how we would like our burgers cooked (medium-rare) and they came out medium-well.  When we asked if fully cooked was rare to them, they said that they don't cook medium-rare.  Why wouldn't the server mention that when the order and instructions were placed? 4. The BLTAs were both missing the A (avocado). 5. When we asked to talk to the floor manager about our experience, Jenna (with the dreads) came over and listened for about 20 seconds before smiling, shaking her head at us, AND WALKING AWAY.  It was the most condescending thing I've experienced in my life.  It was like she couldn't believe that we would complain about our experience there.   6. Since the floor manager refused to listen to our experience we asked to talk to the chef.  Usually, chef's take a certain amount of pride in how their kitchens are operating.  We were told that Chef Natalie (the owner) wouldn't come out to talk to us.  I just don't understand why we were treated so poorly.  We weren't looking for a free meal, we were only looking to be heard and treated with respect.  I would never come back to this place.",

I ended up ordering the 2 eggs any style with bacon, chive potatoes and toast. Though it was a simple breakfast the taste was phenomenal.

I had a mid afternoon flight, so I was hype when I figured out that I could squeeze in a quick trip to eat. Added bonus is that it was within walking distance of The Golden Nugget.   I arrived a little before opening. There were just a few people waiting outside. They were nice enough to let us in a little early. The restaurants itself is adorable! My kind of a joint. It definitely doesn't feel like your typical Vegas establishment. It was small, quaint, and tastefully decorated. They also had a pic of Brittany Howard from Alabama Shakes. Yes! My homegirl in my mind. Ha! I was immediately greeted by the waitress and my order was taken. Although they had other tasty offerings, I just had to order their signature dish which is the cinnamon biscuits with warm strawberry compote and a side of chive potatoes. All of the pics I've seen posted were drool worthy. It didn't take long at all for my food to arrive. The biscuits were everything I imagined and more. Warm, flaky, light, and delicious. The compote was not overly sweet. The chive potatoes were a great side as well.   To make it even better, my bill was less than $12. Whaaaatttt? Yes! I'm a fan of delicious AND reasonably priced. I left Vegas full, happy, and glad I explored more of what Vegas had to offer. I can't encouraged folks enough to check this spot out. It will not disappoint.",

    "text": "On the last day of our family trip to vegas, we decided to use our favorite app to find breakfast away from the typical strip breakfasts that usually consists of either coffee and donuts or AYCE. We wanted something a little different.  With a crazy amount of positive reviews, we decided to try eat. and they did not disappoint.   I ordered the biscuits with the berry compote. A healthy amount of toasted biscuits topped with a compote of strawberries and blueberries. It tasted pretty fresh and just enough tartness to keep it from being overly sweet.   Coffee seemed to be something they were also popular for so I decided to order one. It was pretty good. Low acidity and easy to drink black.  There's only street parking available nearby, but we didn't really have too much issues finding.  Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone around the Vegas area looking for something away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and downtown.",

I like pancakes and eggs, so I ordered them scrambled and set on top of the pancake. The waitress said she'd try, but no promises. Low and behold, that's how they came out. Fluffy where they should be and just a bit crispy -- just a bit -- on the outside of the pancake.  The menu contains much more and I'll be sure to go back again to try more.  The scene was a little loud for my liking, so don't bring grandma unless you don't want her included in the conversation.",

The breakfast menu is stopped after 11am. There was a short wait, but they sat us pretty fast. There is only street parking available. The service was not great. Our server came up to our table to take our order but he wasn't even looking at us while we were ordering. He called out a friends name in the middle of my order and continued to not make eye contact with our table while scribbling on his pad.   My table ordered the fried deviled eggs (only thing I would recommend), shrimp & grits, corn hash, grilled cheese & tomato soup, and the truffle egg sandwich.   Shrimp & grits: coming from the south, I've had my share of shrimp and grits and this one was just horrible. The grits had no seasoning what so ever and the sauce that came on top has no flavor at all. I don't eat my food salty and I actually enjoy grits just plain, but this dish was just horrible. I was tempted to send it back to the kitchen, but since we were there with guest I just poured hot sauce on it...   Grilled cheese and tomato soup: gigantic piece of toast with some cheese on it and watered down tomato soup. Pass.   I can't rate the other dishes. I love variety so I always taste the other dishes at the table, but I wasn't even tempted to get a taste of anyone else's dish.   Verdict: don't be fooled by the thousands of reviews and check-ins.",

Chicken fried steak was also with every calorie that we consumed.  Decor is modern, and since you are downtown - it's with a walk around to visit the container park next door.",

I don't understand why it would take me twice as long to chew my food as it did for me to cut it.

My date said it was out of this world! Hahaha. That bacon and melted cheese just topped the out of the world flavor of this dish.  I was craving for the eggs Benedict but only available on weekends. I came on a weekday to avoid the crowd and long lines. Got there when in opened and got seated right away but within minutes it was full.  I had the eggs mouloteno and it was s different flavor each bite! It was a combination of plantain, black beans, salsa, sweet sausage with eggs on top over easy. I finished the whole thing except for the potatoes with it. Also ordered the biscuits pancake, which was so so, just a bit of moist to it would have been perfect. The brew was so good I had to have two cups.   The place was clean and server was friendly and came with great recommendations. They always came to check up on us which was great. Would highly recommend this place for great food and the location was definitely out of your ordinary Vegas strip. It was a bit of nostalgia of the Bugsy side of Vegas.",

The service was ridiculous I tried asking for ketchup and hot sauce and the waitress rudely interrupted me and said she was already on it.... well she wasn't. I had to get up and grab my own ketchup then they brought the bill and we waited maybe 15mins for them to pick it up and again they never came so I had to walk up to the waitress and pay it. It was close to closing I'm assuming because it wasn't busy. I spent about 60$ and it was definitely not worth it at all.  VERY VERY VERY disappointed in this place.

    "text": "Came here one afternoon for lunch with my girlfriend around 1pm on a Tuesday. Eat. is located in the trendy side of downtown right behind container park and at the edge of the action at life is beautiful. Parking is street parking and luckily we were able to get a spot close to Eat. We had to pay like $2 for parking and convenience but the machines to pay are all new and very easy to use.  When we went inside there were a good amount of people but it wasn't packed and we were still able to find a seat. I'd imagine on weekends there would definitely be a wait.   Service: Our server was friendly and offered/provided help when needed. Kept up with our waters and did her due diligence. The chef or owner? I'm not sure also came by to check on us and other tables which was a nice touch. Very laid back but prompt and knowledgable, which is perfect for a place like this.   Entrees: Killer Grilled Cheese x Roast Beef Sandwich. Both came with sides and my girlfriend chose tomato soup for her grilled cheese and I got chips for my sandwich. When I first looked through the menu I wasn't expecting much. I found the menu to be quite boring and dull as everything sounded so basic, but I was quickly proven wrong. The ciabatta bread was extremely soft and the sandwich was pleasantly warm and not cold. The combination of the roast beef, wild mushroom, mayo, and definitely the arugula provided a nice mixture of flavor and the crunch of the arugula made it just the more satisfying. The Grilled Cheese is very hearty and reminiscent of an english breakfast. Very buttery and tasted like a mix of brioche and french toast. This was also a pleasant surprise as I did not expect the grilled cheese to be like this. Fun to dip with the tomato soup but I'm not a big soup person so I wasn't too blown away. Tomato soup was simple as was the side of chips although the chips were a little too salty for my taste.   Extras: Stack of Pancakes: Ordered a stack of pancakes due to popular reviews as well as thinking that I wouldn't be as full from the sandwich. Not a pancake expert but it's definitely better than the normal ihop pancakes. Butter and Syrup is provided on the side and the exterior is crusted just right. Not too thick either which I like as I feel like pancakes can get real dry, real fast. Thankfully these didn't and I enjoyed it as did my girlfriend.   Thoughts: This is a fun little restaurant downtown as part of the trendy hipster revolution that's swept over this side of the city. Walking around and seeing the area definitely reminded me of places like Seattle, Portland, and Downtown La.  The design of the restaurant too with it's black/ white colors, natural sunlight, open kitchen, exposed bricks, and thrifty furniture. It's like  the neighborhood spot down the street that main character in romcoms go to for a bite to eat. Food is simple, clean, and delicious. Portions are generous, and it's a perfect place for breakfast or a quick lunch. I'm a big fan of this side of town as change is sweeping and I can definitely see a shift in culture. It's exciting to see the growth and change of this area from being the \"ghetto\" or \"old\" to the \"new\" and trendy side of town.",

While on the way down I checked out the trusty Yelp and saw it had very good reviews so my anticipation grew.    Upon entering,  this place was small to average in size, but had several tables to accommodate the lunch crowd.  As such this made it very loud and very hard to hear the conversation I was having, but the staff was amazing and the food looked very good as the staff was hustling it out.  It took  a few minutes for us to be seated, but our waitress was spot on.  The drinks and food were out very quickly.  Our waitress was happy and up beat all while dealing with a busy lunch crowd, and never missed a beat.    I went with a chicken sandwich, (added avocado) and the green chili pesole soup.  I was not ready for the flavor explosion that happened with each bite.  The portions size was amazing and for the price could not have been happier.  Both my lunch partners that day agreed.  This place is another fine Downtown eat spot.  Only draw back is the noise level and crowds, but it's worth the possible slight hearing loss for the food.  Will be back again, and will try non peak hours.  Well done!!!!",

Everything was fantastic! Even the coffee was extraordinary. My husband said the pancakes were the best he's ever had. You can tell the owner and the chef put a lot of thought into every dish. Our waitress was very friendly too. It was very busy when we got there but we only had to wait about 15 min to be seated.   The only thing I didn't like was we sat at the bar right next to the IPad kiosk thing. The waiters had to squeeze right next to me to use it and one accidentally hit my elbow when I was trying to drink my coffee.",

    "text": "When I check out a new spot twice in one week, you know something is up!  Love everything about this place.  Location - eat. is located on the corner of Carson and 7th street.  There's plenty of meter parking and it is tucked just far enough away from LV Blvd to be easy access.  It wouldn't be downtown if there weren't a few questionable characters hanging around, but this place is an oasis.    Food - First time I split the DWBLT with homemade chips (and the really good pickle is aptly named) and the Argula Salad with added chicken breast.  Although the upcharge for the chicken was a little $$, I can assure you it is worth your money.  This salad was very nicely done.  Fresh argula, asparagus, roast almonds and roasted tomatoes.  Definitely unique. Loved both, but I prefer a lighter lunch (although judging by some of my frequent lunch hangouts, you may be calling me a liar) so may not order the DWBLT again.  That sourdough bread is seriously delicious and seriously heavy.     Second trip, I had the Banh Mi Chicken sandwich.  This thing was freaking awesome!  I just love jalapeno coleslaw especially when you throw some radishes in the mix!  Chips again because they are just that good.  I also stole a bite of the grilled cheese sandwich dipped in tomato soup.  Yum!  Service - Both trips, service has been great.  The servers are hipster enough to prove you are downtown, but not so hipster they forget how to smile.  Love the open kitchen, the entire decor and just the vibe of this place.  It really is something special and further proof that downtown is worth revitalizing and worth a visit for lunch.",

I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and we shared a side of pancakes. We had intended to order the beignets, but they were out. I was disappointed until I tried the pancakes. They were the best I have ever had! They were slightly crispy but soft in the middle. I still crave these pancakes and I'm sad that I'm now across the country from them. I highly recommend them. The Shrimp and Grits were very good as well. The jumbo shrimp were seasoned well, and the grits were just perfect. The servings are a good size and the coffee was delicious. I love their big coffee mugs, because I do love my coffee. Our server was great! She was attentive, friendly and always there when we needed her.  This is a place that I plan on visiting again, when I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Thank you, Yelpers for the great tip on this place! We were staying at the D and I didn't want a breakfast buffet for the second day in a row. I saw this place was only a couple blocks away, the photos and menu looked promising so we headed over.  For a Vegas visitor, the walk down Carson at 8am can seem a little sketch but have no fear! When we walked in it was cozy and cute and trendy in a very non-intimidating way. We opted to sit at the counter since every seat was full (30 minutes after opening!) and I'm really glad we did. Our pink-haired waitress was SO friendly, helpful and overall just seemed like a super positive person, which was a great start to our day. Plus, we got to watch the action in the kitchen and the chef was really commanding her own back there.   I had the Truffled Egg Sandwich, which was super tasty. Scrambled Eggs with sauteed mushrooms, chives, feta and kick-ass bacon on a ciabatta roll. So freaking good. It came with Chive Potatoes, which were cooked pretty perfectly. BF had the egg dish that came with beans, peas, feta and some other stuff on a corn tortilla and he loved it. The salsas that were on top were so good.   We HAD to split a pancake because they looked amazing. It was. Perfect crispy edges with a fluffy middle. I could eat these all day.  The lunch menu looked equally awesome, but it was 8:30 am so I passed.  We really really enjoyed Eat and would go back if we could!",

    "text": "It's exactly what we did when we got to this hip brunch joint. Eat!  I love the name of this place. I'm surprised that it hasn't been used yet!  My visit was on a Saturday late morning. Very hip downtown vibe, great for couples or friends to meet up for brunch after a late night.  Their menu focuses on supporting local farmers, making things in-house, and keeping it healthy. There are many unique items that are served here, Mediterranean egg white frittata, truffle egg sandwich, and shrimp & grits, which I'm always curious about. For lunch, what stood out was green chile chicken posole, salads, a Killer grilled cheese sandwich, even banh mi sandwiches! For dessert, shaved iced coffee. Interesting!  Our breakfast:  Steel-Cut Oats Cinnamon with roasted apples, cream and sugared pecans Beignets with jam and vanilla-scented mascarpone Golden-Brown Pancakes with chicken-apple sausage  How's the food? It tasted fresh and homemade. The pancakes were the star of this meal. AMAZING! Light, fluffy, and a little buttery crisp on the outside. My boyfriend and son shared the chicken-apple sausage and they loved it. We've had better oatmeal at other places and the beignets didn't have a light airy texture as I was hoping for.   Service was friendly and efficient. They don't have booths, which we always try to grab to corner in my toddler and their tables were a bit small for the three of us. When we asked if we can use the next table to adjoin to ours, our server said sure, even though I know, being a server previously, that it meant she won't get that table seated. We felt bad and made sure we left a bigger tip to make up for it.   I do wish they had a more convenient location and a slightly bigger menu. More pancake selections, for sure! That being said, EAT definitely intrigues me to return for more visits when I'm in the area.",

I don't understand how as an owner you think it's okay and very professional to tell a customer that it's just personal preference if you didn't like what you ordered?! No it's not personal preference if the food was nasty!  But let's start from the top. When we arrived it was a short wait. 20 mins for a party of 4. No problem. We ended waiting about 15 mins if that.  We get sat and our drink order taken. So far so good. The sprarkling strawberry lemonade was decent. Would get it again.  And then it went all down hill from there. Our server was very rude and short. Had no personality. How do you expect to make money with that dry personality?!  The food.....was just okay. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. Our two friends took maybe 2 bites of the oh so famous best seller shrimp and grits and didn't eat anymore. Said it was tasteless and nasty. So much for top selling dish huh?!   Then the bill came. Wwaayyy to expensive for what we got. Nothing was too notch nor worth the price.  In the end we will NEVER return to Eat. Nor will we be sending any business there. Stay far away and go elsewhere for better food, better service and better owner!!",

We asked what was in their sauce that made it taste unusual and they said garlic and lemon. Well I usually like those things but too much of something made in inedible. We had to scrap the sauce to the side the finish the rest of our food. Potatoes-bomb. Bacon and chicken Apple sausage-bomb. My eggs were even cooked perfectly. I would try them again but skip out on the eggs Benedict",

It IS good, and some of the menu items are tasty, but nothing worth raving over.  We had the chicken fried steak with sourdough toast, truffled egg sandwich, short stack of pancakes.    The chicken fried steak was not really crispy at all, and even if it had been, the flavor was decent but overall nothing special.  The sandwich did have a satisfyingly truffle-y fragrance, but other than that it was a solid egg sandwich.  A little dry but good.  Some sort of sauce would have set it off.  The potatoes were really nothing special.  The pancakes were probably the highlight....there was just *something* that made them really delicious.  Have you ever had malasadas in Hawaii????  The uniqueness of the batter tasted a lot like those warm, melt-in-your-mouth malasadas.  Yum.    Pretty long line, luckily the wait was only 20 min.  Anything longer, in my opinion, would not really be worth it.   And ambiance was SUPER loud.  Like felt like a nightclub loud.  There are so many places in Vegas, and glad we tried this one, but not itching to come back.",

I even managed to leave my sun glasses behind me and one of the waiting staff came running down the street after me with them .... good job!",

Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the eggs, the sourdough toast, even the potatoes were not too hard not too soft and perfectly seasoned. I definitely recommend checking this place out, not only if you live in the area but also if you're visiting. We just happened to be at a motel down the street and it was about a four minute walk. I'm really glad I had a chance to stop by this was like a gourmet breakfast for me. Thank you for the great staff everybody seem so happy there",

The interior decor is simple and clean. It felt cool inside, especially from the hot weather outside. I had the two egg breakfast, two bacon strips, and \"oh so good\" potatoes with sourdough bread.  My hubby had the corn beef hash which was good but portion a bit small. The single brown pancake was the best with a buttery slight crust and tasty pancake served with maple syrup. Yummy.  Oh, the passion ice tea fabulous! It kinda reminded me of refreshing tea in Hawaii.  Overall I liked the place and mostly likely would return.",

I love the decorations inside, especially all the plants they have set up in the restaurant.   Back to the food--make sure you have a very empty stomach or room in the fridge because the portions are quite large. I ordered the golden brown pancakes with chicken apple sausage. The pancakes were cooked just right--not too overlooked/crispy with a burnt taste but also not too overdone. They had the perfect balance of a very slight crispiness on the outside coupled with a soft, kind most interior. Delicious. The chicken apple sausage had great flavor. I should have ordered extra on the side.   You can definitely say that you ate after coming here! If I ever come back to Vegas, I hope to return to this fine establishment.",

My only regret is not arriving sooner as I was craving some chicken fried steak and it's only served for breakfast !! Ugh curses!! The potatoes were awesome BUT some tasted as though they may have been sitting around from their breakfast time as I came later in the day , a few were hard and had a recooked air about them , but otherwise a minor hiccup in a great meal ! My roommate had the pancakes , which he was blown away by their freshness and lightness and all in all goodness !! I tasted them and do have to say they are easily the best pancakes I've ever tasted , lightly sweet and  cooked to perfection! Really my roommate raves about them and has even tried to wake me up early to go get some !! Lol all in all easily one of the best brunches I've had in quite awhile !!",

    "text": "We chose to come here as we were close by and it keeps being listed as one of the best places for breakfast. Obviously, expectations were high.  We thought it was absolutely awful. The only good part was the coffee which, I have to admit, was lovely. It is in downtown and it's a small corner restaurant. There are some different parking options and it was early enough that we were lucky. To begin with, I walked in as my friend was trying to park and the hostess told me that she wasn't usually allowed to seat people until the whole party is in the restaurant. She sat me regardless. The menu is limited... It has options like eggs or steak and egg or truffle sandwich or pancakes. For a breakfast and lunch restaurant only, I would have expected many more options but that was not the case.  Regardless, the truffle sandwich looked really good. It sounded incredible. When it got to us, I don't even know where to start... It looked like garbage on a plate. Do not expect a plate to look nice at this restaurant. The worst part is that the taste did not make up for it. On one side of it were potatoes, some over cooked, all very soft with no crisp to them and not enough seasoning. It was just mush. On the other side was one of the ugliest sandwiches I have ever seen at a restaurant.. It was these two large rectangular slabs of bread that contained some butter and truffle oil on them with unappetizing looking eggs, bacon that was thick and dry, amongst other ingredients. I was able to add fresh avocado which made it a little better. The worst part is how greasy all the food was. It was seriously laden in oil.  My friend wanted jam for the bread and they did not have any! They tried to bring her this strawberry 'compote' which was runny and disappointing... not jam. I ordered a side of the apple sausage...this is the first time I was not impressed with this sausage. What is up with this place?  Service? It was average. The guy was nice, but he didn't check on us all that often and waited to have a coffee refilled. It's nothing to write home about. Just average. The restaurant is on the smaller side but was nice... Once again average. The bill... expensive for what you get. $50 for 2 people.  With how expensive breakfast was with what we got and because we were so unimpressed and we were disgusted by how greasy all the food was, this place gets two stars. I am still baffled by its 'stellar' reviews. Did we go on one of this restaurant's bad days? We are foodies and we love going out for breakfast. We are local to Las Vegas and pretty much know a lot of the best breakfast restaurants in town. This place does not hold a candle to most of them. My friend said it best... for the quality and amount of grease, McDonald's would've been just fine and way cheaper.",

I went with the truffled egg breakfast sandwich and my sister got the cinnamon biscuits. I could definitely taste the truffle in my sandwich, and the mushrooms were cooked really nicely; but the star of the show was the side of potatoes for me--so good! The cinnamon biscuits my sister got were alright--nothing special. She noted it could have used like whipped cream or sweet cheese or something to cut the tartness of the berry compote, and I totally agree. The cinnamon biscuits were definitely lacking that extra something to really round of the dish.   Overall, good, not great. However, for $22 between the two of us, I would totally come back again to give the other sweet dishes on the menu a try--the golden pancakes perhaps.",

No wait, excellent service, and the food came out quickly. Everything I like to hear about a restaurant! I had the Truffle Egg Sandwich that I would've enjoyed more if it didn't have any blue cheese. This was a mistake on my part because I didn't read the list of ingredients outlined on the menu entirely. I tried taking out the blue cheese but a few pieces were still on the bread and the smell lingered. The blue cheese sort of overpowers the other flavors. I did, however, love the potatoes that were served on the side of the sandwich. They were perfectly crispy on the outside. I had some of my boyfriend's corned beef hash and it was pretty good but the portions were small. I also wanted to note that some of the brunch dishes are only served until 11 am like their Chicken Fried Steak. We arrived a little past 11 am and missed it.",

Nonetheless, I sat torn on what to order until my waitress kindly urged me to go with the pancakes so I did.  I asked for strawberries to be added atop the thick and fluffy cakes and bacon paired with it.  Everything was great - strawberries were sweet as ever, pancakes were SOOOOOOO good and not overcooked liked places do making it hard to cut w/ a fork, and the bacon omg was thick cut, crispy, and godly.  All in all, great service and even better food.",

I was looking for a good breakfast spot that wasn't too far away from our hotel (we were staying at the Plaza in Downtown). This was right around the corner, about half a mile away.   When we got here the place was packed, but they cleared up a spot on the bar for us and we sat down within a minute. The service was top notch, everyone was friendly! We sat right in front of the kitchen, so we could see how quick and efficient they were.   I got the chicken sandwich, which was delicious! My girlfriend got the grilled cheese which was huge and super cheesy.   The place was beyond packed, and we were able to sit down, order, get our food and eat all under 30 minutes!   I would highly recommend this place if you want some great breakfast food, that's not overly priced, and made with fresh ingredients.",

Not sure why but okay.   The menu was a small selection.  We tried: - cinnamon biscuits - chicken fried steak -corned beef hash - killer grilled cheese - argulla salad And more   But none of it was outstanding to me. We all shared since it was our first time. Food was okay. I would've given it a solid 3.

Normally, I would ask and get a weird look or like a .....\"uh ok.\" The staff was super friendly and was pretty chill about it and totally knew/understood what it was for.   My husband and I (great minds think alike) got the Two Eggs Any Style (mines scrambled...his over easy... I would have got over easy as well but due to being preggo I can't eat the yolk like that). It came with smoked bacon, chive potatoes and toast. It was the perfect amount of food...cooked to pefection. Delicious.   Loved the fresh squeezed OJ (I love pulp).

Chef Natalie's version has that gratifyingly creamy yet tingy hollandaise, eggs poached just right, crispy muffin and really, really, tasty turkey bacon. Don't bother looking for it on the regular menu though, as it's only available as a \"special\" on weekends. It comes in different variations (I had versions with sauteed spinach, and grilled tomato--both awesome). But if you cannot make it to Eat on the weekend don't despair: there are still other Southern-inspired gems. My recommendations are the grit dish, which is fantastic, and the pancakes are at once fluffy and crispy, and taste like donuts! I usually order a single pancake for desert AFTER the Egg Benedict. :)    Great place all around, with nice ambiance and one-of-a-kind decor. I just love those comfy green chairs!",

I love coming here for breakfast and brunch every time I visit Las Vegas with my girlfriends.  We managed to always have the same server, Gary.  He's always pleasant, courteous, and helpful.  Eat uses sustainable and organic ingredients supplied locally and grown which they turn into delicious, innovative breakfast food.  Eat has Sweet & Savory (granola Greek yogurt, cinnamon biscuits, and golden-brown pancakes).  Also has steel-cut oats, huevos motulenos, chicken fried steak, and chilaquiles served daily.  Eggs entrees are served all day.  They also have Soups (black bean veggie chili, green child chicken posole, and tomato soup) in 2 serving sizes (half or full).    We ordered the following - Shrimp & Grits - has smoked bacon, two eggs over-easy & pick de gallo $15. If you never had grits or do not like grits; order this dish and you will changed your mind about grits.  This lovely and heavenly dish is very tasty and delicious; my all time favorite and I craved this all the time. 5 stars plus Truffle Egg Sandwich (extra-Avocado) - comes with two scrambled eggs, wild mushrooms, green onions, feta, & bacon on ciabatta with chive potatoes $12. Plus $2. (Avocado) This is a gourmet sandwich! 5 stars Arugula Salad - served with asparagus, oven-roasted tomatoes, parmigiano-reggiano, toasted while almonds & lemon herb vinaigrette $10. We love the fresh taste of the Arugula with asparagus tossed together salad. Very yummy! 5 stars  5 stars for friendly atmosphere and staffs.   Eat's motto is \"Good food for good people, made with love in downtown Las Vegas\"  P.S. Changes to the menu politely declined.  Ample metered street parking. Hours - Mon - Fri 8AM - 3:00PM except for Weekends 2PM.  I cannot wait to try Natalie Young's new restaurant, Chow combines Southern classic fried chicken with Chinese dishes such as potstickers (dumplings).",

Many of us had to wait for about 15-20 minutes. But the meal was worth the wait.   I ordered the deviled eggs. The yolk topping was delicately whipped and was topped with a hint of bacon. The cinnamon biscuits with a strawberry compote were good too, but the compote was just a bit too sweet for me. Decent prices.",

I recommend the Cinnamon Biscuits and the Truffled Egg Sandwich but really anything on the menu is worth getting. The space itself is open and comfortable, never a long wait, but I do recommend getting there early, the wait can take sometime but only because the word is out that this is a great place. The wait staff is always helpful and attentive. So get downtown and experience Eat.",

Very cute trendy vibe but the food and menu was solid comfort food. Great to get breakfast for lunch! I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs. The portion was a tad on the larger side but I was really hungry so I had no problem finishing it all, tasty large cut sourdough toast included. My husband had the roast beef with blue cheese served with crispy homemade, which had a delicious seasoning sprinkled in. Clearly appeared to be a local favorite as I was observing the crowd which was diverse and from all ages. They had cute patio dining which was not used most likely because it was a little chilly outside. Highly recommend trying it if you are a visitor. Not a celebrity chef establishment but rather a solid addition to the Renaissance of the downtown area.",

    "text": "So disappointed!!! Arrived at Eat today at 11:45. We were so excited to finally try this place and had high hopes. We were a party of 13 and were told it would be an hour and 1/2. An hour and 1/2 seemed long but based on our party we accepted it and agreed to wait. We asked the hostess to take our number as we had 7 kids and wanted to let them play at the Container Park. The hostess agreed and said she would call us. About an hour and 15 min later we called to make sure things were on time. At that time I talked to a man who said they were running behind and it would be at LEAST 45 more minutes. This was VERY frustrating- not only would this be a 2 hour wait, it was 110 degrees we had 7 hungry kids AND they had our phone number and never called to tell us they were running behind. What ever happened to a professional courtesy or just good business practices.. We tried to wait and eventually 30 minutes later ended up down the road at La Comida. Later our friend called, talked to a manger who basically told her it wasn't their policy to \"call\" people because people \"like her\" usually don't answer their phones!!! Needless to say she was quite offended. We waited by the phone and were not \"those people\"! He then said they opened at 8:00 tomorrow if we wanted to come back. He said he wasn't prepared to offer anything for the inconvenience. Overall pretty bad experience and I don't think we will give them another chance. Get it together EAT!!!",

And I wouldn't be as disappointed if it was a cheap breakfast place by for the hefty price tag of this dish it is not worth what you get.",

The Cooks were doing an awesome job working there butts off trying to get everyone's brunch out quickly. The food was delicious. The sausage was especially tasty. I will defiantly be back for the food.  The waitress I had was a different story she was the dumbest waitress I have ever encountered anywhere. I don't know what her name was and I doubt she could remember it if I asked her. She was tall and brown hair and cross eyed. First it took forever to bring us drinks because she forgot us multiple times. We asked for straws and I understand sometimes you run out of things but she was back searching for an eternity and came back with two straws (there were four of us) and asked who wanted them. Awkward. She should have just said they were out. She then brought us our check but it had already been paid by someone else....ok do we just leave? So we confronted her about it and she gave us some BS dumb answer how she misused the plus and subtracted our....what?! She ran in the back and we never saw the brown haired blond the rest of our visit. Thankfully the good looking restaurant manager swooped in and saved the day by fixing our check she was on top of things. We will be returning soon but only because the food was amazing.49$ for 4 people",

As a Brit, I'm skeptical about getting scotch eggs anywhere but back home, but this place nailed it by putting their own spin on it. The rest of my party had the truffle egg sandwich with potatoes and that was awesome. You really can't go wrong with truffle. The hubs also (yes also this man is a bottomless pit when it comes to food) got the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese is huge. Wow! But very good. Awesome breakfast place.

I'm blown away that he still has a job and is there, representing this establishment. It's the second time he's waited on us, and the second time he was nothing but plain nasty, rude, and obnoxious. We are happy, cheery, easy going people to wait on. My sister and I are vegas locals. Our father was visiting, and we brought him here and were honestly embarrassed of how disgustingly his attitude was from beginning to end- FOR NO REASON. I'm a bartender of 8 years, I couldn't be more easy and friendly when it comes to dining out. We STILL left 20%, ONLY because our blonde drink server was the cutest and friendliest ever. Had we been waited on just him, we would have left a fat zero tip. You don't get rewarded for the way he acted. You need people skills to work in the service industry. He has none. Find a new line of work, Gary.",

We got sat within that time a nice corner cushioned booth.  The house was full. Cement brick walls. Reminds me of a place I've had brunch in San Francisco.  Fabric napkins.  Condiment plate is the centerpiece with assortment of sweeteners.  The menu is presented on a clipboard. I had the passion fruit iced tea.  It was unsweetened tasted freshly brewed and refreshing. Read the reviews here and ordered the common suggested shrimp and grits as well as killer grilled cheese.  The server warned us they are known for food to arrive right away and there might be a bit of delay.  Service was on point, everything arrived in a timely manner. They were plated nicely.  The grits were topped with shrimp hidden underneath a pico de gallo like salsa.  It was good but maybe not my taste to crave again. The grilled cheese looked great made with thick toast. The tomato soup we asked to have with it was thick. The menu lists tomato salad.  Just the right amount of cheese!  Like this one!  Our bill came out to $32 for two drinks and two plates. It was a cute place to catch up with my girlfriend.",

Corn beef hash and eggs - corn beef hash itself was good. Diced and goes well with the egg yolk.   Shrimp and grits - grits had great texture. A good amount of shrimp but tasted frozen.   Pancake - tasted like funnel cake. Not bad.   Coffee - nothing special   Passion Fruit Iced Tea - refreshing  Here comes the horrible service. These are facts, not opinions.  We were seated by a nice hostess and given our drinks immediately. Our server whom I will not name for his safety didn't bother to greet us or introduce himself. After we ordered and was well into our meal, not once did he come up to us to ask \"how we were doing?\" \"How's the food?\" Or refilled our water cups. However, he did all those three service favors for others around us. I politely asked for syrup from him and he gave me a blank face. Came back and put the syrup in front of me with no word.   After we were finished with our meals and already annoyed, a busser comes to our table and asks (in a awkward tone) \"are you done?\". He stacked our plates quickly and never said a word further. Not to mention we thanked him for cleaning our table.   When I asked our waiter for the check, he came back with it and didn't say a single word. I paid and left him a tip because I understand servers make their money off tips. I left him a personal note to let him know our experience at Eat.  Extremely disappointed.... Our highly anticipated lunch at Eat. during our thanksgiving weekend getaway was ruined due to the poor service.",

    "text": "Not the place for a large group of people. Particularly if it matters.  I've been to EAT a few times. Generally I want to support the businesses in the new downtown, selfishly, as I really want this area to succeed as a genuine alternative.  The purpose of my comment today, is not about food or service, which I have generally found to be satisfactory without being outstanding. Breakfast offerings in LV are pretty low grade.  Today, I selected EAT to meet some friends who were in town from the other side of the world. I had called to make a reservation earlier and the staff explained they didn't take bookings. No problem. We had a larger party so I took the opportunity to ask whether they felt they could handle that without a bother when we came in. I was told that it would be fine. It wasn't.  They do a thriving business at EAT. Good for them. However, on this occasion we were not able to be seated together and once our guests had arrived, we were not made feel welcome to speak with them, not able to pull up a chair and join them or get a larger table.   As a result we were not able to spend any time with our visitors and ended up leaving without having enjoyed the purpose of the location. Sadly, the staff, whilst trying to a basic level, didn't really care. They were asking someone what was OK and not. I assume this is the owner based upon earlier reviews.  Seems that money, money, money, money is the big driver here and there clearly wasn't much consideration for the continued ordering that would have taken place from our party. OK.  As I had said to the member of staff (that I had spoken too before coming to the restaurant), if you cant accommodate have the courtesy to say so when people take the time to ask. I would have found another venue.",

We were seated promptly and greeted within a few seconds by our waitress who brought waters over for us.   A few moments later she came back to take our orders; I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich with a coffee and my friend ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Both meals were not only delicious, but super hearty also. The Truffled Egg Sandwich was ON POINT. I'm always nervous about the bread to filling ratio, but this was perfect. Breakfast sandwich dreams are made of! I would try to recount what deliciousness was in the sandwich, but I think I was so sleep-deprived that I couldn't recall. It also came with a hearty side of breakfast potatoes. My friend's Shrimp and Grits were also pretty tasty. It's served with thick cut bacon on the bottom, topped with a runny egg, and an optional side of toast for dipping (this toast was more like Texas toast and not standard bread).   Service was great, food was great, coffee was great. All in a great day in DTLV.",

I ordered the truffle egg sandwich ($12) and would give it 3 stars. Their ingredients are all fresh and local which I appreciated and overall the sandwich was good but nothing to rave home about especially since I couldn't really taste the truffle. I did enjoy my friends' homemade potato chips and I had a bite of my friend's Reuben which was surprisingly delicious.   eat is very community based and fosters a lot of love for the local food, people and flavor.

Two of us had shrimp and grits... It was okay, but didn't wow us.  There was a nice quantity of shrimp in the serving.  Another person ordered the egg truffle sandwich.  It was a large sandwich.  She said it was good but not something she'd go out of her way for.    The potatoes that come with the egg truffle sandwich had an odd taste, almost like they were tossed in rancid oil first.  My friend has a complicated palate and said perhaps they were seasoned with truffle oil...  I don't know but I would not order them.    We ordered regular coffee and it had an unusual flavor as well.    The parking is limited to metered street parking.

I recommend it - egg n mushroom sandwich: love the bread on this one. Soft inside with just enough crunch on the outside to hold the sammy together without needing to bite down hard - huevo \"something\" (forgot the name): has egg , banana, beans, red chili sauce and corn tortilla. It was not cloying as one might expect. Banana added a fragrant sweet taste. Very good. -posole: spicy w lots of vegetable. Too spicy for me but the person who ordered it enjoyed it .  Great service",

    "text": "I had high hopes for eat. based on all the reviews I had read of their breakfast, but they were sadly dashed one by one throughout the course of my meal. The hopes were mostly kind of silly (looking for a live DJ! Wanting to drink a mimosa!), but some of them were just basics of eating out (having a server who didn't treat me like serving me was the last thing they wish they were doing, bringing maple syrup with pancakes) and those were kind of a big deal.  I know that sometimes I like to order odd things. In the case of eat. I ordered a pancakes based \"meal\" and a side of grits. I asked to switch bacon for sausage. I don't know if that's considered a big deal in some areas, but I've never thought it to be a huge thing in the past. Then my husband ordered. Then the waitress said to our table, \"guys orders are always so much easier than girls.\" Wha??? I think she was just talking smack about me to my face and to our whole table because I asked to switch sausage for bacon? That alone would have been enough to make me feel uneasy with my meal, but the rest of the meal kind of went along the same route - taking a long time for refills of coffee or water, not bringing any syrup with pancakes and not checking in on us for long enough we had to flag someone else down who did bring us the syrup so I could eat my lukewarm meal.  Anyway, the pancakes were actually really, really good. The other food was average. But, none of it was worth feeling like I was a hassle for trying to eat breakfast there.",

Designed as a sort of upscale urban soul food space for locals and featuring a menu both familiar but interesting, all composed of locally sourced fresh ingredients I knew right away that I was going to like eat. and although our server J.D. seemed a bit hung over (or perhaps just socially awkward) the moment food began to arrive my suspicions were confirmed.  Starting first with great coffee, copiously refilled throughout our hour-long visit, and moving straight to shared plates of NOLA-quality beignets, crispy buttermilk pancakes with pure maple syrup, and a plethoric fruit cup it was obvious from first bite that Chef Young is not skimping on ingredient quality and although I favor sweet to savory 95% of the time the meal only got better when we moved onto our main plates; the shrimp snappy and sweet with exceptionally toothsome grits and the truly unique pairing of heat and sweet tossed with peas, feta, and two poached eggs quite unlike anything I've had before or since - the Motulenos an absolute must order and the restaurant more than enough reason for local or tourist to get up early and trek off-strip.",

    "text": "I've been hearing about this place and was excited for a new breakfast place that also sources local, supports local artist and is on the pulse of the growth of downtown. It's already sounding like my kind of place with a strong ethos for community and quality.  The banner says, \"eat.  A breakfast and lunch place.\" was actually a breakfast THEN lunch place. Wish I knew before  going down there that they do not serve both together. Weekdays breakfast is stopped at 11am, then lunch until 3pm. Weekends is brunch until 2pm.    We order up the killer grilled cheese since that was sounding good to the BF. The tomato soup it came with was really good. It was a bit cheesy and creamy and like there was chunks of tomato in it, not just puree, which I prefer. The grilled cheese was just OK, though I generally will enjoy thick buttery toast. Nothing mindblowing.  I couldn't decide between the shrimp po boy or the pot pie and chose the chicken pot pie since it sounded good to the BF. I blackjacked on the wrong one. The flavor was decent, but as I got to the bottom there was soggy crust that absorbed all of the sauce from the filling and made the filling thicker than pot pies normally are. The top was crunchy enough and it would have been better if they just did the top and skipped the bottom crust as it won't crisp right in a thick and shallow ramekin. The egg on top was over medium-hard and had a bit crisp burnt edges and wished it was yolky good. The salad it came with was very light and fresh though. Very fresh mixed greens, shredded carrot, sprouts, tomatoes.   As much as I wanted to love the food here, soup and salad shouldn't have been the best part and nothing impressed my socks off.  Also, I thought for $4 for ice tea, it would taste better or be unique passionfruit. It was standard tropical ice tea flavor, but it had that oversteeped taste so I didn't really clamor for refills.  Service was on the cusp of adequate. It was odd how quiet our server was. I asked for something and he just made the slightest of nods and walked away to another table which left me a bit thinking if he was gonna get it or not. He did end up bringing me some hot sauce. He just put the check on the table, no acknowledgement or asked if there was anything else, while we were eating or checking to see if we want our ice tea topped. He wasn't mean, but I guess wasn't friendly either. Seeing their website talking about the importance of people, you'd think this would be the warmest just-like-home service spot.   I see that the hype and the love is for breakfast or weekend only items. If stuff like the shrimp and grits, the huevos montulenos and eggs benedict (weekends only) gets people talking this place up, then have that magic stuff available always!  I don't get why the switch in menus considering this place is open only until 3pm weekdays. Vegas is a nightlife industry so you would think they would try to catch as much local support as possible and have breakfast for swing shift and graveyard, not just the AM folks who work at the government buildings in downtown.   The menus are small that combining it would be 20 items. It's not impossible to make breakfast items as well as salads and sandwiches of the lunch menu. I get simplifying to make it easy to prepare, but then I would expect it to just KILL that execution and flavor when you're making a pot pie special, 5 sandwiches and plating already cooked soup and mixing salads. With small menus you would expect a jes ne sais quoi with everything you order. If they were to have breakfast items all day, I would maybe give it a chance again before heading into work.   I'm so so sad I had to rant instead of rave of this place. I started this review as a 3star, but it felt more suited to a 2star by the end of it. I haven't been this disappointed in a long while. This much talked about breakfast will have to elude us then. I just don't see us making the effort to wake up outside of our sleep pattern to be here early for a place that left us with doubt.",

Now the pancake.... A slight crisp to it and the inside fluffy and flavorful. The wait staff is pleasant and helpful if it's your first time.  I'll be back again and again. There is a wait and a little tight in the waiting area but again worth the wait. Enjoy your meal.",

But most of all I love their eggs Benidict. The flavor is so perfectly balanced and hollendaise sauce is made fresh. Eggs where cooked just right. Almost as good as mine. Hehe.  I love the fact that they have music for Sunday brunch, it was a bit loud but the music was good so I didn't mind. My table was bobbing our heads and jamming out to good music and good food. Who doesn't love that?  Service was great, kept our waters filled and coffees warm. Super friendly staff and fast services. Over all I give it 4.5!",

I kind of depend on YELP reviewers to help me decide where I'm going to spend my hard earned cash or in this case, cash I won at the casinos.  Our table ordered several dishes and we all shared.  The Chicken Fried Steak was amazingly tough given the fact that the inexpensive cut of beef was tenderized!       The dwblta was served with a very hard, unripe, and inedible avocado.    The \"made to order\" beignets came to the table fresh out of the fryer.  They \"looked\" very good.  Unfortunately, they were very dense and really needed a lot of jam and mascarpone to give enough flavor.   I'm not sure whether they were really \"made to order\" or just \"refried \" to order.  The Huevos Motulenos dish wasn't too bad....actually not bad at all, but the potatoes were tasteless.   The coffee was good.  But, the mug it came in looked as if it had been previously used.  Coffee drips were on the front and back of the mug....not necessarily from someone drinking from it...but none the less, not a clean looking mug.  Later, I asked some server walking by to get me a clean mug, and without hesitation did so and filled it with fresh coffee.     We asked for an extra plate and got the smallest plate possible.  So, we asked again and finally received one after a wait.  We asked for extra jam and immediately got the jam, as well as attitude from some tattooed server/cashier. The servers were many...in fact there were so many different ones coming to our table to do things (two to take our order, two others to serve, another one to get the plate, and yet another one to bring the attitude, and still another to bring the check or it could have been the same one....bottom line it would be nice to have just one who tends to our table.   (BTW, our initial servers who took our order were out the door by 9ish that morning. We couldn't figure that one out.  Maybe that was why it seemed we had so many different servers plus it appeared some were in-training.)   I paid and left a small tip because not every server there was lacking \"good waiter\" qualities.   There are so many restaurants competing for our business and thanks to YELP it makes it a little easier to decide.  But it is unfortunate when customers don't take the time to critique bad experiences.  What we experienced today does not appear to be a one time thing.....but a lack of control over the quality and preparation of the food and the disregard for its customers experience.  I was disappointed that I wasted my money and  I will  NOT be coming back to this restaurant.",

We all shared the beignets and they were great - an unusual menu item that stacked up the ones I've had at Cafe du Monde (sp) in New Orleans. For my main entree I went with the shrimp and grits and was very happy with my choice. The sauce, consistency and seasoning was a great blend of savory and spice. I was pleasantly surprised to find bacon strip buried at the bottom! Topped with an egg that you can break up and mix - this is a dish I will order again.

Three different party's of 5 or more came a left because the wait was going to be so long and being that there were  tables for 2 open she wouldn't even move.

I had the Huevos Motulenos and my friend had the special of the day, bananas foster. We both cleaned our plates.  Highly recommended!",

Other than that great place!",

    "text": "We arrived near the end of breakfast service and were told by our wait staff person that we would need to order from the brunch menu.  We moaned and told her that we were hoping to have breakfast.  Another person (the manager???) overhead our conversation and came over to tell us if we could order quickly that the kitchen would accomodate our order.  We asked what she would recommend; she suggested the Shrimp and Grits.  I had intended to have something really breakfast-like but since that dish was on my 'to-have' list, I thought, why not try it here.  My cousin ordered the steel cut oatmeal and the beignets.    When the food was served, I split off some of the shrimp and grits to share.  What a mistake; I wish I could have eaten the whole order myself, after having the first bite.  I'm not sure if the restaurant's recipe was traditional, but it sure was gooooood.  Buttered grits on the base, perfectly cooked shrmp, sweet crispy bacon, sauteed pico de gallo, two eggs, and finely chopped red onion.  There was a great balance of flavors and texture.  I'm usually not good with raw onion, but these were cut very fine and were extra sweet so they added an unexpected flavor and texture.  My cousin was also happy with the oatmeal.  This review would have been a 5-star except that the beignets were pretty heavy (suspect that if we had ordered them in breakfast prime-time that they would have been lighter.  But the homemade jam that they were served with was very good so that made up alittle).   Will definitely come back on my next visit and will recommend to my friends and family.",

I will make it a point to eat here every time I come to Vegas, and encourage everyone I know to do the same.  Came in for late breakfast on a sunday. Packed house, but we didn't wait too long. We had shrimp grits with eggs & bacon, and scrambled eggs with bacon & smashed potatoes. It was all wonderful. Even though the scrambled eggs had obviously been waiting too long under a heat lamp, they tasted so good that all was forgiven.  Very, very loud - probably not the best spot for hangover breakfast.  Really happy we found this place.",

The establishment is really clean and spacious from the dinning area to the restroom and from what  I can see into the kitchen as well. They gave us way too much time to make a selection from a small menu but the food came out pretty quick and piping hot. We spent $30 on huevos (something ) and chilaquiles small orange juice and a coffee. Huevos had scambled eggs black bleans,peas, feta and small pieces of bananas. Side of potatoes and topped with red and green chile sauce. Chilaquiles similar to a nachos but so much more healthier and fresher. Corn tortilla chips around the plate, farm fresh scrambled eggs topped with this sweet sausage, cheddar and jalepeno mango salsa. The food is AMAZING! Quality ingredients, fresh and the flavors balanced perfectly. Nothing was drenched in oil or butter or over spiced. Portions were big also. We found out about this place off of the food network and its well worth checking out, I believe they only serve breakfast and lunch.",

By the time I was done eating an awesome free-range chicken sandwich the place was starting to get packed. The restaurants maximum occupancy is 89...so maybe not a place I would go in peak hours.

Now about that sausage that came with both dishes, some of the best sausage I've ever tasted, if you like it a little sweet.  The chilequiles you just have to try, so many contrasting flavors and textures that I just can't put into words...

We wanted to be sure we didn't miss brunch! Some passengers on our flight had the same idea, because when we were finally seated after waiting a few, the couple next to us was from our very same flight! How cool! Small world!   Based on some reviews I had read, we ordered the Shrimp and Grits and Huevos Motulenos. I've never had Shrimp and Grits before, so this first experience will forever be ingrained in my memory as \"holy o-m-g, where have you been all my life. How do I recreate you at home so I can eat you all day long???\" The shrimp was tasty, however, a tiny bit chewy. The bacon and tomato water mixture was heavenly. I love tomato. Yum. The cheesy grits were delicious and savory. So so so good! I didn't want to give it up, but I sacrificed it so I could swap plates and eat half of the Huevos Motulenos. I thought the flavors of this dish were interesting, but good. A nice combination of tortillas, eggs, black beans and cheese plus special sauce. The sauce was not something I was used to...a little sweet mixed with a lot of savory. Overall, I would definitely return for Shrimp and Grits and try those \"so fluffy I could die!\" pancakes.   Excellent high-quality well-prepared tasty food at a moderate price point in a very hip and trendy space.",

The more breakfast type items on the menu are only server up until a certain time (11:00 am I believe). For a starter, we ordered cinnamon biscuits which came topped with strawberries and blueberries. For an entree, my mom and I both had the chicken fried steak and my sister had a Caesar salad. All of the food was good and not too expensive in the end. Service is quick and friendly. They do have a sign asking all patrons to be courteous and finish in a timely manner to allow those waiting a chance to dine. I'd say it's a place worth checking out for a quick and filling bite to eat.",

The chicken fried steak is very hearty and tasty. It's also a big portion too. The chilaquiles was flavorful. What I liked was the tortilla chips stayed crispy and didn't become soggy. And having sausages in there was different from other chilaquiles I've had and I liked it.

It has a show kitchen where you can see the staff work, and the sounds coming out are to be expected. Since there are all hard surfaces (ceiling, cement floor) the sound carries, but again, that's ok.  What made it uncomfortable was the music which added to the din. We were there at opening time on Sunday morning, and the music was turned up to industrial levels. It was difficult to talk to my husband, and I missed a few things the server said. I just wish the volume was a little lower. The other issue is the service.  Our server was reasonably polite, and that's good, but there were just too many workers there at that time without enough to do, so they wouldn't give us time to enjoy our breakfast.  Our server checked back right away to see how we were doing, which I appreciate, but what really bothered me is that the check was plopped down on our table before we were half done with our meals.  She said 'No rush', but it sure felt like it. There were only four other occupied tables in the place, and no line waiting for a seat.  Three other servers refilled our coffee and water enough, but each time asked us if we wanted to-go boxes and tried to clear our plates before we were half done. I noticed it happening at another table as well.  Whatever you do, don't put down your fork and stop to savor your food because someone will  attempt to take it away from you regardless of how much is left on your plate. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to enjoy my breakfast, but the noise and the servers gave a sense of urgency to get out of there. If we had been there for an hour and was taking a table away from other people waiting, I would understand, but we weren't. We spent $48 (including tip) on breakfast for two, and were only there for about 45 minutes which included being seated, looking at the menu, ordering, eating, and drinking coffee. This isn't supposed to be a fast food joint. We might come back for the deviled eggs, but I doubt it.",

After  several locals suggested this eatery, our brunch venue decision was unanimous. The location/building is quaint at first glance however the dining room is lofty, modern, and quite comfortable. My friend and I both ordered the 2 eggs brunch (I debated between that and the shrimp & grits). My meal included 2 eggs, country potatoes, bacon, and toast all of which I devoured within minutes. The portion size was perfect and while my selection may be quite comon in most American diners, eat quickly earned the #1 spot in areas of taste, value, and individuality. Our server (thin girl w/nose ring) was extremely friendly and warm, she offered suggestions and took care of us throughout our brunch hour. Will I be back, YES. Would I suggest eat to others, Yes!

We stop going about six months ago, mainly cause we felt the food quality was nos as good.  We ordered some pancakes, which is one of our favorite dish there, but that time, they tasted stale and they were cold, we left very disappointed. Today we stoped by the restaura again, decided to give it one more try...  it was awful, for starters our waiter was not very nice, my wife ordered milk for one of our kids, and she asked if there was a chance to warm it up, \"Gary\" our waiter look at her like it was the most outrageous to ever ask, over all his demeanor was just condescending and not very nice.  We ordered few things, pancakes, the corn beef hash and the two eggs with potatoes and toast.  The corn beef hash was average, not too flavored, and the pancakes were burned.  To top it off, I had to take my son to the restroom and it was very dirty.  I was very disappointed and we will not be returning to that place again.  It makes me sad writing this review mainly because we really loved this place and what it represented to what's been going on in down town Las Vegas, I had recommended so many people to that place.

    "text": "On the unassuming corner of 7th and Carson Street in Downtown Vegas resides an old institutional blue apartment building which was once surrounded by undesirables and derelicts.  Now it's surrounded by a weekend brunch bunch, eagerly awaiting a table into a place simply called eat.  And to that one syllable name, I offer an equal one syllable description that says it all: good.      After running a 10k in a 80's get-up, a friend, who also ran it but didn't bother dressing up (because she's smart like that) suggested we have breakfast at the nearby eat.  I'm always up for exploring new places since I never get out.  She and her husband were not new to eat and so they suggested that I try the Huevos Motulenos.  I read the ingredients: 2 eggs, red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta, sauteed bananas on corn tortillas.  The discriminating, reserved me would have said, eh, maybe some other time.  But since I was already sticking out like a sore thumb dressed in neon pink leggings, teased hair looking like Madonna circa 1984, I decided, yeah, let's continue this wild new adventure and let me motorboat that dish.    And motorboat it I did.  I probably would've licked the plate, but I didn't want to look like an animal.  My friends stuck with the traditional pancake short stack and had chicken sausage with it.  They look great, but not nearly as adventurous as the Huevos Motulenos.    A band started to set up while we were still eating.  They moved perfectly good seating to make room for the live entertainment.  I've nothing against live entertainment, but it limits the seating to an already small cafe.  I'm glad we got there before the rush because when we left, people were outside waiting to get in.  They may have already solved that problem with setting up some patio seating, or at least it appeared that they were going to at the time when I went.  But honestly, it's Vegas, it's hot and getting hotter and it's doubtful anyone wants patio seating.    To sum it up: if I had to wait, especially if there was a live band playing, I'd probably go some place else.  If there was no wait, I would gladly eat at eat again.",

The food was average. I ordered the posole and shared the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was great but there was not enough meat for the bread. I had half the sandwich and then had to leave the other half of the bread alone since there wasn't enough meat to eat with it.   The only downside to this place is that it gets EXTREMLY loud when the restaurant is full. When we first arrived the place didn't have that many customers which was why we were seated promptly. Unfortunately when more customers arrived the louder the place got. It was also almost as if they turned up the music as well making it that much louder since people had to talk over the music. I felt I had to scream to my friend who was sitting next to me just so that she can hear me. :-(   I will be coming back again, hopefully they will have addressed the noise issue and mabe give me a sandwich that has a better filling to bread ratio.",

My hotel's concierge recommended \"eat\" so I looked online and found great reviews. From the time I was greeted by the hostess, to when I was served by Ali, my waitress, to when I shook the hand of the manager as I walked out, I felt as if I were the only patron in the place. Clearly, I am no VIP yet I was treated like an important customer. Yes, the food was great (loved the Eggs Benedict!) but the service was fantastic. Thanks to the hard working cooks and staff for a marvelous Sunday brunch!",

The hostess then had the nerve to tell us our table was ready, and I can clearly see there were a lot of open tables and told us oh wait another five minutes. One or two decent employees, but if you're not white I don't recommend you coming here. Menu looked decent but for the prices and short menu I expected better reception and decent human treatment. Places like this might serve you better if you walk in with a \"make america great again\" hat or dressed like a hipster douche. Even upon upsetting my wife the hostess was still rude and luckily for her I have more class otherwise I would have cussed her out and started a scene. Manager I'm calling you out, get your shit together, train your staff better and learn how to treat people of all ethnicities and backgrounds better than this sorry ass mess of a restaurant!",

I have never been to any other Las Vegas establishment that had a manager approach us and not even try to accommodate any of my allergy or dietary concerns.  It is definitely not our fault that you do not have enough cooking space to accommodate a simple request to use a separate pan. I mean, really?! No room for a pan?! No time to quickly clean the grill?...and no, I do not want a salad for brunch or a $7 oatmeal that I can make at home for 50 cents. Thanks for nothing, as we will not be back.",

My friends and I stopped in here after running the Sprinkler Sprint 5K and we were ravenous.   Very quaint place, small and interesting menu. Caters to vegans and vegetarians which I love. I ordered the Huevos motulenos which was quite good a little sweet, a little spicy. Served with potatoes which I didn't really like, and a sauce that had black beans and whole peas. The peas seemed a little odd in this dish, like they were out of place. But... still very interesting meal and I ate most of it. It also had tofu pieces in it which were a nice addition.  My friends had the fried chicken which was an enormous portion. They also ordered a side of pancakes for all of us to try. I have never been big on pancakes but I tried these, and HOLY cow these are melt-in-your-mouth pancakes. I can't even describe them other than fluffy. Really good. We will all definitely come back to try other things on the menu, great service and amazing food.",

I've never had better pancakes before. The grilled cheese is served with huge slices of the most delicious and thick bread and a fantastic tomato soup. I'm honestly getting hungry just typing this.   The owner takes her job very seriously. You won't find a rude waiter in the place, and she makes sure of it. She's always around making sure things are running smoothly no matter how busy it gets.

The sandwich tasted really good! The egg melts in your mouth with that truffle. I gave half to my wife which I regretted but sharing is caring and happy wife = happy life.

The groups were waiting more in the range of 30 minutes.  It is a popular weekend spot and for good reason.  I ordered the truffled egg sandwich with avocado and it was cooked to perfection.  The ciabatta bread alone was a must try, and accompany that with the fresh ingredients to create a great meal.  And sitting at the counter was very scenic as well, watching the chef work her magic in a very small, intimate kitchen overlooking the restaurant.

The main section of the menu is only available until 11am (the second time we went, sadly, we missed the deadline). Both days there was a line -- a testament to the quality of the food. The servers were so friendly, efficient, and worked well together. The food was delivered quite quickly, was delicious, and came in huge portions.  On the first day, we sat at the community table to get seated quicker. We were seated with a couple from LA, who were in Vegas for a wedding. They said EAT was their favorite place for breakfast and they always eat there when they come to Las Vegas. They gave us some great suggestions of what to eat before they left. We started with their recommendation of the cinnamon biscuits covered in strawberry compote. They were even more delicious than they sound. Oh my! Then my wife and I split an order of The Huevos Motulenos, which consisted of two fried eggs w/ red & green New Mexican chili, black beans, peas, feta, & sauteed bananas on a corn tortilla. Different, yet delectable.   Before we were served our Huevos Motulenos the server asked if four new people could join our community table. Of course we said, \"Yes\", and soon engaged them in conversation, it turned out that one of the four was Tim Olyphant, the star of the TV shows \"Justified\", and \"Deadwood\". That was a great breakfast!",

The tomato soup that my friend had was very delicious with tons of the buttery garlic flavor leveled to the extreme. Not bad for your wallet because pricing was very reasonable. Our small stomachs couldn't handle eating the other half of the sandwich so we took the rest Togo. Wait time isn't too long because it was a Monday. I bet weekends are jam packed.

Well I was truly glad that I got our group to let me choose the Saturday breakfast. (They actually had no choice I was driving)  Eat is roughly about a 5 minute drive from the California Hotel making it really convenient. Waiting only 10 minutes after we arrived at 9:00am we were seated in this nice trendy hipster place in downtown. The sound level was a little loud with the music and people chatting but it didn't deter us from enjoying the food and decor at Eat.  Some of the items we ordered:  *Beignets <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ#FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> Great item to share, jam and mascarpone made this dish yums. *Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg#--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  I swear the hollandaise sauce must be one of the best I ever had!  *Pancakes with chicken apple sausage: My friend took one bite and busted out a huge smile. I got to sample the pancakes, melt in your mouth and a slight crunch on the edges of the pancakes made this dish a must. *Eggs with smoked bacon and smashed potatoes: Smoked bacon was that standout of this dish.  *Outside seating available *Street Parking *Friendly Service  *Eat is a must for breakfast when staying in Downtown*",

We were seated right away both times (yay) but waited at least 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence. The place isn't big at all so even if you're busy you can at least say hello to your table!  The first time, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich is ginormous and 90% bread and 10% cheese. While the cheese was yummy, you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread. Should be more cheesy in my opinion. Shrug. But to each his own. And the server gave me chips instead of potato salad. When I asked her to bring me the salad, she seemed perturbed. Geez! It was your mistake, not mine.  The second time, we waited 15 minutes to order, very frustrating. Especially when you only have an hour for lunch. I ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon. For $11 I expected something goooood. WRONG. My eggs arrived well over medium (no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in, booooo.) The potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth, and the bacon way too crispy. Guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone.   When I asked for jam for my toast, again the server seemed hassled by my request. Is it just me? Do I have a booger on my face? I didn't ask for new eggs because I don't like to complain (nor do I risk saliva or snot in my food). Very disappointed at both of my visits.  This place has let me down twice in guest experience and food. I will never go again. Overrated.",

    "text": "Average service. Average food. Overpriced for what you get. The \"truffles\" on the sandwich were nothing more than regular ol canned mushrooms. Eggs were powdered and not real. Bread and potatoes were both greasy and soggy with no crisp. BLT was nothing special considering the cost, tomato soup was really over garlicy and oversalty. Would not recommend, considering IHOP is the same exact thing but cheaper. This is one of those places that likes to call themselves \"botique\" because they have framed art on the walls so they can justify overcharging you for cheap food. Also our waiter wasnt very warm either, kinda gave that vibe like your bother him.",

The Service-- - The hostess was nice and sat us quickly.  - Our waiter was super friendly. He makes up for the bad experience. However, he did not check on us at all once our entrees came. Although, he was charismatic about serving us.  - The Manager: absolutely rude. Being from out of town, we stopped by Dutch Brothers for some coffee. We brought it in not thinking about it at all. Many of the waiters commented on how much they love our coffee. So when the manager came around and said \"You can have your coffee in here but you can't drink it,\" we thought he was joking and laughed. He goes on to say \"I'm not joking. It's a law. You can't have it in here.\" It is an understanding rule, but we were so put off by it because of how rude he said it. If he would have been kind and humble about it, we would have been fine with it and would have complied. Instead, he decided to be an asshole about it. He went on throughout the meal with checking on other guest but not once did he come to us.   The food was great. The hostesses and the waiter service was great. The manager...he was an asshole. As much as I want to give 4 stars for the food, the manager killed my experience. I would recommend this place to others strictly for the food, but will warn them about the Hitler manager.",

I ordered the corned beef hash with cheese and avocados. My wife had the truffled egg sandwich.  This was arguably one of the best corn beef hashes I've had in a restaurant. My wife was equally impressed with her truffled egg sandwich. We also ordered a pancake on the side and was very impressed. Gary, our waiter, suggested we eat this while it was still warm, great tip Gary, thanks! The pancake was perfect! My only complaint would have to be the coffee. I normally would take away a star for this, but the food was so incredible I can't.  We will definitely make this a stop every time  we are in Vegas!",

My friends and I usually stay on or near the strip, but for this trip we went downtown because we kept hearing a lot of blah blah blah, about how much it has changed. We walked one morning from our hotel to EAT. It's about a 10 minute walk. EAT. is a prime example of what the new downtown can and will be in the future if all goes well. This little place gets busy, but it's worth the wait. I got the chicken fried steak, delicious and well seasoned. The toast they serve is about an inch think which is great if you love bread. The server was attentive, but she did seem a little overwhelmed the day we went. I saw the owner there chatting with regulars. If downtown continues to offer up similar types of places, I may be spending more time in the area to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "Oh my. I'm still dreaming of this food days later.   Went on a quick weekend trip to Vegas and after googling good breakfast/brunch places we decided to eat at Eat. The menu has a lot of personality -\"eggs known to make a giraffe dance\" and \"really good pickles\"- AND it had great reviews online.   I was a bit worried because it was located in old downtown. I was born and raised in Vegas and that area was always quite sketch. BUT I have to say things are totally changing down there and it's actually super cool! We felt completely safe although there are still reminders of the old downtown.   We went to brunch around noon on a Sunday. There were a lot of pay to park options near but they were all taken so we parked on a street south of Eat by Las Vegas Academy. Parking was M-Sat so we were good! We waited about 15-20 minutes and were immediately seated. One girl waiting in line was holding a Donut Bar box. Smelled amazing and we wish we would have stopped there as well but they closed at noon. So many other fun eateries nearby as well as the Container Park! Fun area.    Service was prompt! Background music was fantastic! It is a bit hipster but the place just has a fun vibe. I got the Dwblta sandwich with the tomato soup and my friend got the Truffle Egg Sandwich. My sandwich was bomb!! Big sourdough slices of bread with chipotle mayo dipped in a homemade soup with a bite was . Great portions as well. I couldn't finish my plate but I really wanted too! When all was said and done each plate was $15-16 bucks. Totally worth it. Can't wait til I can come back to this place!!",

They weren't able to put tables together so we got split to 2 groups of 4 and 5. Many of my friends were looking at the menu online and felt kind of limited to its options but our friend had chosen it because there was something vegan for her. There were things on the menu we were all set to order but saw that it was only available until 11am so that brought our options down. I did see some people ordering eggs Benedict's but didn't see it on the menu so if you do want that, just ask the waiters and they should be able to put the order in for it!  That being said, I got the traditional Benedict that was $12-13 with potatoes on the side. I love potatoes and theirs was pretty good. They also had chicken instead of the bacon which is $3 more and since it wasn't on the menu, my friend didn't know and was sad he had to pay extra. The hollandaise was flavorful and I liked the hint of lemon and appreciate that it wasn't overpowering. The egg was cooked nicely as well. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp with grits and didn't really enjoy it and had me try it. It didn't have any flavor and I felt bad for him but he didn't want to order anything else. Overall, this place is okay but I'm going to give it another star because of its ambiance and how my friends and I still had a great time together.",

Fine, ordered the Huevos Motulenos and Chilaquiles. Food came out quick no complaints there. Then we ran out of coffee and water. Our mistake I guess. Plenty of people walked by and no one took notice.   Three stars is low for the quality of food and quick service. It was the service and waitresses lack of a smile that took a star our from a solid four star review. We are not local, we were visiting, we will not come back. Nacho Daddy down the street was of a much higher quality food and service. Recommend check that place out, closer to Freemont street near White Castle.",

    "text": "Swing by here for some Sunday morning brunch since I was in the Freemont area.   The one positive thing was the service was tentative. The food on the other hand, not so good.  We tried the new Mexican style dish that has an odd name which was a tortilla with red and green chili sauce and bananas. This was not a good combination at all. I almost got sick after the first bite.  Next I opted with something simple which was the chicken sausage and pancakes. It came with one small link of sausage and 3 large golden pancakes. The pancakes was average and drowning and very cake like consistency in the middle. The sausage was decent but there was only one small link.  Skip this spot!",

So I decide to order my staple; pancakes!  Used to be the best in Vegas so my mouth was watering.   Until they arrived literally within one minute of me ordering (I was  sitting at the kitchen counter).  I asked how this could happen and was told by a rude flippant waitress, whom professed to be the manager, that they make them ahead of time and they're \"okay.\"   I then saw the pile of pancakes sitting back there on the counter, cold.     Mine were so cold the butter on top never melted.  I brought this to the \"manager's\" attention and she didn't care as there are too many other fools in line waiting to pay money for poor food and service.    Save yourself.....go to the freezer section of your grocery store, buy some frozen pancakes, pop 'em in the toaster and avoid the bad attitude eating old food that can just be warmed up.    Sad.....very sad.   AVOID THIS PLACE!! There are far better places in Vegas that care about their food and quality.  Find them and go there. Great food exists in Vegas, and you can tell this place is declining as it used to be listed consistently as number one.  Now it's getting pushed down the list for a reason.    Goodbye Eat....thanks for the memories.",

Like butter in my mouth rich in flavor and very fulfilling then chive potatoes are to die for! The eggs Benedict are just beyond words! Super tasty and filling! Last I ordered the pancake and it was amazing! Fluffy and not overpowering when eating it. Dissolves greatly in my mouth and their maple syrup tops it off for great flavor!

Their soup seemed to be a signature item so I asked the server if it's normally that salty that is inedible. He just said he'd tell chef and took item off our tab.

For one 4 waitresses kept asking us if we were ready to order as if they were in such hurry but then when we asked for the check at the end it took them forever. We ordered the chilaquiles and truffle egg sandwich. On their menu it states that they don't substitute but I figured I'd ask maybe they would say yes. So we requested pouched eggs w the chilaquiles and over easy on the sandwich. They agreed but did not deliver. The chilaquiles came w scrambled and the sandwich came with hard fried. They asked if we wanted to add avocado to our ordered and the avocados on both our plates were rotten. They took off 1 of the avocado from the bill and ended up not charging us for our drinks so there is always that.   See pictures of the rotten avocados and scrambled and hard fried egg.",

Never had bananas mixed with eggs but it definitely worked. I didn't need to add anything to it as the flavor was beyond epic.  Hubby ordered the special Downtown Benedict. He loved it too. Coffee was hot, lemon water chilled and service fast and extremely friendly.  Totally hit the spot after drinking too much in DLV.

Expect to wait it up, even when you think everyone else should be hungover. It's good here. Worth the wait? That might depends on how sober, hungry, and patient you are.  The portions are grand, make no mistake. Initially I thought the pricing was a tad extreme considering the location, but you certain stretch your dollar more than you would where I'm from, Santa Monica. Luckily enough, the recipes are decent as well. And yeah, I got one of the more popular dishes around, the truffled egg sandwich. The bacon is a bit of a detractor in my opinion, but whatevs. People love their bacon.  Parking isn't too bad either, which is a major plus. Streets are about $2/hr, and spots aren't terribly rare.  Make your way over. That is, if you're willing. Vegas still awaits.  GOOD: big portions, good food OKAY: service could be a tad slow even though it wasn't full BAD: recipes can be hit & miss",

From the second we walked in we were greeted with warm welcomes and despite how busy it was, got seated in about 3 minutes.   First off, the portions here are HUGE. Come hungry.  Secondly, expect to spend a decent amount of time choosing what you want - so many great options.  We sat at the bar so we were of course drooling at food in the window until we finally chose.  Grilled cheese with tomato soup - probably one of the best I've had.  Chicken sandwich with tomato salad - delicious, filling and hearty for sure. The bread was great.  Highly recommend. I'll probably be back tomorrow for the pancakes.",

If you wanna get away from the standard casino buffets, stop by this place. You won't be disappointed.  As I was leaving, someone ordered the pancakes. I'm not even a pancakes fan, but the next time I'm in Vegas, I gotta try it!! They were so fluffy and enticing. Maybe this place will change my mind about pancakes.  I'll keep you Yelpers posted...",

My corned Beef Hash was fine, but nothing special.   My friend Ms. W and Mr. P both got the Pancakes. It was a much better portion for the price compared to my dish. And the Pancakes were very nicely done. I particularly appreciated the little jars of  real maple syrup they came with. But getting plain and simple pancakes just isn't my thing - I need them full of granola, smothered in Nutella and topped with strawberries because I'm that kind of crazy girl.   The best, most special thing I had was definitely the deviled Eggs. They were panko-encrusted and fried, then topped with bacon. Now we're talking!  Maybe I should've tried their cinnamon biscuits topped with strawberries. It seems to be one of their most popular dishes and based on the Pancakes and the amazing bread the provide to go with just about every plate, they do Grain-based dishes best.",

First thing I noticed is how cute it is here. It's like a hipster diner.   We started with the cinnamon biscuits and strawberry compote: delicious, and there was no added sugar. It tasted so fresh.   For breakfast I chose the corned beef hash. It was literally the best corned beef hash I've ever tasted.   They must cure it in house or order it special, because it wasn't the stuff you get at the grocery store.   Service was attentive and quick... and sincere.   I didn't feel like I was bothering anyone by being here.   Both servers made us feel welcome.   We'll definitely be back.   Even if we're not down here... I could see myself craving this place.",

It's a melting pot and a nice one at that, I just sneezed and the tall gal with long dark hair next to me said, \" bless you.\"  The service is perfect. Efficient, on time, informative and uninvasive.   The potions are huge!! I got the country fried steak with pork sausage gravy, scrambled eggs and huge chunks of fried potatoes... Huge slices of wheat bread.... The steak was huge... Everything was big and very delicious!   Overall eat. is the new American diner for the new American landscape.

They usually stay way \"out there\" in Henderson and I'm usually north. Finding a safe, \"meet in the middle\" restaurant that's not inside a casino and with street parking is harder than one might think.   We shared an order of biscuits with jam - which was more like dessert than an appetizer. For some reason, starting breakfast with something sugary seems to be socially acceptable. Why isn't this the case for dinner?  For my main course I had to try the shrimp 'n' grits. It's my new thing, and I've been told that the chef has some history with NOLA. As expected, the grits were buttery and bacon laden. Just how I like 'em. A very rich start to the day, indeed!  No mimosas, wine or Bloody Mary's this time around. Yes, we were in Vegas but still... my parents are wild and it was like, a Tuesday morning around 9 am. We save our drinking for later at night.   Breakfast for four people was about $75. Not bad. I'm always blown away by prices of food in Vegas vs. San Francisco. I'd be much fatter if I lived in Sin City for sure.",

Nonetheless, I've only been here on weekend mornings for brunch. There is often a wait if you don't come earlier when they open, or if you come with a larger group. There is a good amount of seating but it does get filled up and becomes a bit crowded. Their food tastes super good. Everything is full of flavor, and the portion is very reasonable for the price, which isn't too high either. Their food has always filled me up. Their grilled cheese is perhaps the biggest grilled cheese I've ever eaten..more so like two sandwiches in one. If this place isn't a bit far from me and so busy on weekends, perhaps I would reconsider coming here more often. Great place!",

    "text": "My reviews are usually some long rambling story. In light of my 100th review...I decided to catch up on my yelping to make eat lucky number 100 by keeping it 100.   Upon reading the other reviews, I was still interested in eating here. Mainly for the hipsterism of it. However, the reviews about service...do not lie. We came in after stuffing our faces at donutbar. Who does that? Lol. We did and we are still feeling the chubby from it and this was a week ago. That's another review. Anyway, hostess seats folks infront of us, then seats us. Seating was quick, perfect. She wasn't rude nor was she anything near the good morning sunshine vibe I like to spread. No biggie.  We were a party of 4 that day. 2 adults with 2 minions. We sat down, menu pages clipped to a clipboard... spiffy. As I scrolled through the menu I immediately get the I should've done a u-turn because nothing genuinely appealed to me and nothing on it was something my minions mouths could be entertained by. Now note....MY minions. So if you have kids and they're into such selection, don't go talking about my review and how there are plenty for kids. =P  It felt like we had forever minutes to go through our menu. I must've flipped those 3 pages as long as it takes to watch Titanic. Of course I'm joking, but you get the drift. I'm going to skip the fine details inbetween but by the time our waiter got to us, he seriously asked us if we needed more time. At this point, I had told my husband numerous times I am not feeling the vibe and I'm ready to exit to prevent anymore disappointment. The waiters didnt even look happy to be there, people are staring at their cellphones like they've been sitting through the Titanic movie for the 3rd time in one sitting.  I immediately replied, noooope, we are ready. Waiter seriously didn't even look at us in greeting form or just to connect. He was seriously distracted by something. He was taking our orders but looking up and around, as he was jotting it. Imagine your waiter not looking at you, looking around, looking behind his back like he is being chased, and is pretending to be a waiter until his assailants have passed by, then he can rip the waiter uniform off and be on his merry way.   The meal took too long to come considering what we ordered. My husband had the half bowl posole with a stale piece of tortilla chip. He said the stale tortilla chip ruined the vibe. I side ordered their chive potatoe and scouts honor...a bowl of burnt potatoes were served. I don't know if there were garlic pieces in it or whatever...but they were burrrrrnt. Did I say anything? No. I was tired of waiting and our metered parking by then was down to 20minutes. Eat what wasn't charred and move on. I ordered the free range chicken sandwich and decided for the house chips. For the waiting time for our meal to what was serve...it definitely did not live up to what it looked. Chicken is supposed to be pan seared...but my chicken tasted more like pan seared in bulk just to reheat later. I didn't like that my chicken was a bit cold. Not to mention it was pretty bland. I had to open it to double check if the pesto mayo was even smeared in there.  Even their house chips were over cooked--abandoned.  Our server was MIA the whole time...which made everything about our experience here a reason to not return. I literally had to catch him as he was clearly planning on by passing us, failing to realize my husband needs an h20 refill. Just give us our check.   I seriously walked out with regret. That says a lot. I never want to make negative reviews, but it is my quest to eat somewhere and decide what is True annnnd if I personally find it kid friendly.  Negative reviews on service....very True in my experience. My kids were the only kids there at that time. I didn't find the menu too kid friendly. But scope the menu ahead because I didnt. It's good to not be so planned in such a calculated world. I loved the decor and concept, and imagined it being a cute place to eat at with a friend or partner after a walk or something...just didn't live up to the hype or what I hoped it'd be.  Sadly, I won't return. Unless, a friend wanted to go. I always say give it a shot because my experience doesn't necessarily mean it'll be everyone's experience.  High chairs available with working buckles, yay. I'd leave the stroller in the car just to make it less of a hassle.   2 stars is what the gut said to click.  Just keeping it 100 for the 100th review.",

It's kind of like sweet plantains and adds a nice sweet kick that goes really well with the spicy sauces, creamy eggs and egg yolk and hearty black beans. And the crisp on the outside soft on the inside potatoes on the side are very good too, especially eaten with the huevos combined.   Cinnamon biscuits were nice too. The strawberry compote adds a good acidity and moisture.   Pancakes were also great with a nice crisp edge and fluffy body.  I would for sure return! Plus the wait staff was great too.",

We shared the biscuits which came slathered in very sauce and topped with a generous portion of whole fruit: strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. We also ordered the corn beef hash. Surprisingly flavorful, it came with two perfectly poached eggs and four pieces of sourdough. The two dishes were the perfect pairing of savory and sweet.   My only qualm: Drinks are a little pricey. $3 for coffee & $3 for an Arnold Palmer? I'm used to only paying a dollar or two for drinks, especially coffee.  The coffee here wasn't anything special but my fiance pointed out there were free refills on both drinks.   I was happy with the service. One of the waiters (who wasn't even our waiter) came over and told me he was worried about someone stealing my camera. I appreciate the gesture & I'd totally return to give business to kind-hearted people.",

    "text": "FIVE STARS.  I'm bumping up my review of eat to a fiver after my breakfast yesterday morning.  I entered eat around 10 AM hungry for some breakfast action not knowing exactly what I would get. I've been here once before for breakfast and had the truffled egg sandwich (delicious!), but this time I went with the Chilaquiles Scrambled Eggs, What the... this is what breakfast is made of my friends. Everything about this meal from the ingredients, to the execution, to the presentation was perfect. I was so satisifed with this meal I was thinking about the great review I was going to give it while I was eating it. Not to mention, I cleaned my plate.   This delicious meal is scrambled eggs, turken, jalapeno mango sausage,  corn tortilla chips, cheddar, red & green new mexican chili. The mango sausage is the star that pulls everything together because it has an amazingly sweet, savory, and spicy taste to it that plays on your taste-buds.  I've been in here when there were a few more people (as in the place was packed) and the loudness leaves a bit to be desired for ambiance, but my breakfast was calm with minimal noise even though there were quite a few patrons (and myself) sitting at the bar.  What also gets to my heart is the fact that they use locally grown produce here from Caliente, NV. I love it. We need to get back to that idea of using what is near us instead of stuff that is miles and miles away.  Overall, love eat. I will go back to eat here again and again.",

I couldn't find it on the menu, but when I asked about it, the waitress checked to make sure the kitchen can still make it. Stoked that they were able to and it was one of the best I've had! Friendly staff and delicious food? You can't go wrong!  Oh, and (I think) the food network was filming while we were there. So awesome!",

It's a little bit of drive off the strip and as you pull up, it seems a little sketchy due to the neighborhood/attached to some kind of motel/travel lodge, but luckily it's a pleasant surprise as you walk in. It has a really homey/welcoming decor, great service, & food.  The highlight of our breakfast was definitely the cinnamon biscuits with strawberries - it was like a dessert, but SO DELICIOUS. I got the truffle egg sandwich which was a B+ (it was good, but not great and the potatoes that accompanied it was just ok as well), but my partner got the Chilaquiles which was an A++ due to flavors and just really  yummy.    Anyway, I hope this place does well and that more people make it off the strip to try it. It's just a different experience than some place like Hash A Go Go so if you want a good breakfast - definitely try this place out.",

Basically a more exciting huevos rancheros with over easy eggs, two delicious salsas, black beans, feta, and bananas (they were a little surprising at first, but added an interesting element of sweetness).  Bahn Mi Sandwich--this dish is no longer on the menu, but it was super delicious and sometimes available if they have the ingredients in house.   Downtown Benedict--classically amazing in every way.   perk: super comfy seating.   Don't order tea or orange juice, it's crazy over priced.",

BF and I came here on a Sunday morning (thank you daylight savings and east coast time difference) around 9:30am. We got a table within 10 minutes. The restaurant is spacious and you don't feel like you're sitting on top of each other, which is nice. Everyone working there is super friendly. Although Charity was supposed to be our waitress she was very busy with other tables, so another waitress helped her out. I even noticed Charity find a woman's credit card that was left on the table after the group had already left and she ran out of the restaurant to find them (they were parked across the street). Although Charity didn't take our order she still checked on us while we were eating.   Speaking of food, we ordered the Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak with sunny side up eggs, and a side of short stack pancakes. The eggs benny was deliciously light and perfectly poached.  One of the best I've had! The Chicken Fried Steak and gravy was comforting and flavorful. The pancakes.... OH the pancakes! BEST BEST BEST! The edges were crispy and while the middle was fluffy and perfect. WOW. I want more.   Next time I'm in Vegas I know where I'm going for brunch!",

    "text": "This must have been a great week full of culinary finds and updated reviews.  I haven't been back to Eat since my birthday in April, probably because I didn't really have the best sandwich for my taste buds.  This place is super convenient from my office and should have been frequented more.  Well, I came back to this place for business meeting and I was glad I did!  The place is still the same charming location from last time.  I really like the color scheme: medium tones of green and white.  Looks retro, clean and modern at the same time.  Seating includes a bar top, tables and booths.  Lots of space, but it packs up!  We ended up waiting about 15 minutes, but don't leave!  It's worth it :)  For this lunch date, I decided to try the Free Range Chicken sandwich for $12.  My side was the popular potato salad and chips combo from last time.  Homemade chips, lightly seasoned and homemade potato salad, this time super flavorful, was a great combination.  The sandwich is free range chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomato, mixed greens, sprouts, pesto mayo on a ciabatta bread.  Let's talk about the star of the show, the chicken.  These were breast meat chickens, so tender, so flavorful, so perfectly cooked!  LOVED IT :) mozzarella melted on the top of the chicken cloaked over and brought a lightly salted element.  The veggies offered lots of fresh texture to the meal and of course, the pesto mayo sealed the deal!  Such a great sandwich and really made my day!!  Alright, this was the dish that made me say, \"I've gotta come back real soon.\"  No joke, this sandwich is awesome!  I also love the staff and got to meet the owner of the place. She's lovely and has done some great work with this joint.  Come check them out!!",

    "text": "This is my second favorite place to go for breakfast! Too bad I don't live in Vegas. I went her twice during my stay, I had to go back a second time before I left.  I was a little upset that they didn't serve omelettes, but that feeling went away when I bit into their food. The tofu scramble is by far the best on the menu. Try adding some jalapenos to it for a little spice!   I also had the posole. Mind you, this was my first time trying posole. IT WAS THE BEST! I went with my boyfriend, and he didn't believe me when I said it was so great. He tried it, and instantly fell in love. He rarely does this with Mexican dishes because he is Mexican himself. We were so impressed by the food, we said to ourselves that we had to come back the morning before we leave back to California.   Surely enough, we did. I went there looking to order the exact same thing: tofu scramble with light jalapenos with a half bowl of posole. We were burdened with bad news. They change the menu on the weekends, so the only time you can get the posole is during the week. This the ONLY reason why I had to give it four stars instead of five.  Either way, if you go here, you won't be let down! It's very healthy and and great alternative to the buffets in Vegas.   Enjoy!",

My wife had the shrimp and grits ($13.00).  Shrimp and Grits looked good, and it tasted even better.  ( 4 stars )  Corned Beef Hash came with sour dough toast.  Nice combination of food.  ( 4 stars )  Pancakes were yummy!  On the menu it says Golden-Brown Pancakes.  Well, they were golden brown.  The maple syrup they provided with the pancakes complemented it very well.  The Chicken-Apple sausage on top of the pancakes was delicious!!  ( 4.5 stars )  Eat is worth venturing away from the Strip.  They make very good food here while providing a clean atmosphere and good service.",

I know that is good for the owner, as it increases the profit margin (and I'm all for that) but I am not sure, I just felt it needed some omlettes, and other items to make it a real breakfast place.  It just might be me, but that is what I felt.  I would go back, and I want to try lunch next time.",

And he talked about another of his ventures called Downtown Project, which is investing in revitalizing part of downtown Las Vegas. To that end, the Downtown Project offers loans to people wanting to start interesting and exciting businesses I the area. He told us that he met Natalie Young, a cook at a casino, and learned about her and her dream to start her own restaurant. So he invested in Natalie's vision, and \"eat\" was the result. It proved to be so successful that Natalie paid back her loan within a year due to the wild success of eat (she's now starting another restaurant, called \"chow\").  American Express learned about Natalie and did a commercial about her:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0GhkPEL8S_I&s=9527dfed656819d15e3d993048f48f075c164fdfd95eba70e3a491e30470cee6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">m.youtube.com/watch?v=0G...</a>  I've never eaten there, but will the next time I'm back in Vegas. This story alone should encourage more of you to try her restaurant. And thank Tony for making an incredible investment.",

Again I had phenomenal pancakes on one visit (real Maple syrup, yay!). But I did want to try something new.  On a second visit, I tried the Huevos Motulenos: 2 fried eggs w/ red & green New Mexican chili, black beans, peas, feta, & sauteed bananas on a corn tortilla. It was spicy and sweet (due to the bananas), very different, and quite delicious! My boyfriend stuck with the pancakes and was very happy with those.  We were there twice this trip and service was excellent both times, with coffee refilled often without ever having to flag down a server.

You can totally see the potatoes being chopped up. Bacon is grillen. Potaotes are sizzling.   Service: everyone is pretty helpful. This place is crazy busy.  Luckily we didn't have to wait to sit down but all good food takes time. So I'm writing this review live pretty much as I'm waiting.   Food: these were the best pancakes of 2016. Super amazing super fluffy super light. Doused in butter.  Super amazing. Highly recommended for pancake lovers. The truffle egg sandwich was light. Needs a tab bit more truffle but I was satisfied. (4/5)  Notes: street parking is a pain.  Parking away from the main street. 10-15 dollar range. A gay guy kept on touching and hitting on. He said he doesn't normally touch other guys ( he was drunk and he was....happy.  Lol. )  Verdict:  bring the crew if you are on this side of the strip. Might be a wait tho. Have a blast !",

They only serve drip coffee- man do I wish they made espresso!  My advice: if you're not dining alone, get an order of cinnamon biscuits for the table. They're delicious and compliment a savory breakfast perfectly.  Their classic breakfast options are tasty and reasonably priced, chilaquiles are good, even the tomato soup + grilled cheese is great (though be warned, their bread is super big).",

It's actually very spacious inside, it didn't take the hostess long to seat us, however there was just two.  I'm easy to please when it comes to breakfast food. All I need is a nice big cup of coffee and good food. Both of which this restaurant has plenty of. We both tried the truffle egg sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good. The sandwich was a little hard to eat though. It was pretty fat. The bacon was also a little to crispy for my liking, but I guess thats what I get for ordering something with bacon when I don't actually like bacon that much. The truffle part just sounded too good to pass up.  The service could have have been a little more attentive. It was a little hard to get a refill on my coffee. I tried asking and the girl just kind of walked away before I got the chance. I just need a refill to save me from the food coma..",

Beef hash = good bite size but on the salty side (more than it needs to be)  Eggs Benedict = biscuit layer is thin and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The turkey bacon was a nice touch. Comes with a side of potatoes (super crunchy). Overall, I would recommend it!  Pancake = it was topped off with powdered sugar and comes with there own maple syrup! This is a must try!  Chicken Apple sausage = BOMB!  I am definitely coming back to try the other things on the menu! I want to try the shrimp grits and the chicken fried steak.",

    "text": "I took the advice of my fellow Yelpers and stopped here for breakfast.  I had looked at the menu online, and I had practically decided what I would have before going, but I looked at the menu in any case.Coffee was brought quickly while I was looking at the menu and reaffirming my decision.  I had to go with the Huevos Motulenos.  What an interesting breakfast!  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, peas, sauteed bananas, and feta cheese with two over easy eggs on top and then topped with red and green chili sauce.  The dish comes with home fried potatoes.  Since this is a breakfast and lunch restaurant only, these home fries are made from scratch. These aren't cubed potatoes left over from last night's baked potatoes.  I watched as the one cook cut the potatoes and then stirred them as they grilled.  The menu states that this is a zesty dish.  It was excellent!  I could have used a little Cholula, but I decided to have it as it was served than eat breakfast with lots of hot sauce like I'm known to do.  Service was very good.  I like this small new place--open only 2 months--and it does have a \"loft\" kind of vibe like another reviewer stated.  My only complaint is parking over which Eat has no control.  ----End of review  ----Editorial follows:  ** Note to the mayor and city council **  If you're going to have meters, convert them so you can pay with a credit card like other cities.  I don't walk around with parking meter change in Las Vegas.  Better yet, take them out.  If you want us to continue to come downtown, make it a bit easier!",

    "text": "EAT, pretty simply put, how could I go wrong as I Yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from Vegas?   I generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on Yelp, but I was hungry and I was biting on the the Yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. My GPS in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist WTF was this some kind of Yelp trick? I found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the Fremont Street Experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#1FLXhCFNGaHKlo7mePjUCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  Maybe 707 never existed before Eat made her home here???  After feeding the meter across the street I crossed and hesitantly I walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#5hwJW33twIKPbYqGXborAw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. He showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. Nice guy.  As I read the menu I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore Toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featdowntownlv.com%2Fbreakfast%2F&s=7e4b1925e12e7cba4d62524dcc9fbd04f26c823a28b7f8cb1b195814b1cc3cfb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatdowntownlv.com/breakf...</a>  FOOD ORDERED: Truffled Egg Sandwich Two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes  WHAT I GOT: Truffled Egg Sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. The sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. This sammy was good! And the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****STARS <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#atNQH5fb6TgXBd6UtOgXkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  The service was great too. Plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. Had their s**t together.  4.5 **** Stars  I also briefly met Natalie Young  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#kz1WySQnziPX0GxnBQvwQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> the chef / owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. She seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.  She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.  This place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local Las Vegas eatery. Its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. This place is what most trendy LA places wish they were  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#lSlXZcBJk6tow9WEoEUcsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.  I gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!  I'll be back, next time in Vegas!",

But it was just average and that left me disappointed, especially with all the rave reviews and delicious looking photos from other Yelpers.  We came in Sunday at around 12pm for brunch. Our visit started off on the wrong foot. The wait was long and we were a little discouraged since they were closing in an hour. The hostess who greeted us at the front was very rude and we almost left because of her bad attitude. But we decided to stick it out since we were excited to try the food.   Luckily, after we were seated, we were assisted by different employees and our visit picked up. We ordered the pancakes with chicken apple sausage, egg Benedict daily special, and an avocado BLT. Hubby was not impressed with the Benedict and my friend complained that the bread used for the BLT was too thick and overwhelmed the sandwich. I thought the pancakes were really good.   Another con was the sticker shock. There are a lot of places in Vegas with cheap breakfast specials with similar quality or better food. Anyway, I won't be going back.",

I've been interested in trying out this place for about a year now, but due to a busy schedule and their TIGHT hours (8am-3pm) I never had the opportunity to try it out! :(  Yesterday we were in the area and interested in trying something new, and luckily they were open! As soon as we walked in, we were worried about a long wait time due to the fact that there were SO many people eating and also people waiting to be seated. But as soon as we walked in, we were seated right then and there, which was convenient. I assume it was because we were a party of two.   I ordered my food, (see photos!) and my boyfriend ordered his. Our food was okay. The service was okay. The food looked so good, but after eating it, it just felt.. greasy and heavy in my stomach. Not alot of healthier options in my opinion. And the bread that they add onto your plate... HUGE... Huge slices of sourdough bread, and 3-5 slices on your plate! I could hardly finish my bread, while my boyfriend didn't even touch his.   The food portions are quite large, much more than we expected when we ordered. Had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered the cinnamon toast strawberry dessert, because even though we shared it, we still couldn't finish it.   About $40.00 for brunch.. kind of pricey. Overall, my experience here was okay.. maybe in the near future I will try it again.",

We were told we would not be seated until the whole group was present. We countered with the logical point that our friend was literally two minutes away. Still, we would not be seated because \"we can serve people in less than 20 minutes.\" Not sure what that had to do with it. We could have easily sat down and ordered his coffee within that two minutes. Oh well, gotta love rule followers.   Anyway slightly annoyed we eventually sat down and started with OJ and coffee. Our server was awesome. She had a great attitude and was fun.   The cinnamon biscuits were crazy hyped as the thing to get so we got 2 orders. Yea, not sure what that was all about. Dry, bland. Sure yea it's awesome I guess, when you sprinkle cinnamon on biscuits and call it a craze? Fail.  Most of us are huge fans of deviled eggs so we ordered those as well. 5 star presentation but 1 star taste. Again, bland. Was hoping for some horseradish taste or seasoning. Just tasted like a deep fried egg which was a unique twist on the item but lacked flavor.  I ordered the eggs benedict which happened to be a special. I love eggs benedict and order them any time I can. I took two bites and pushed the plate back. The hollandaise sauce was bland and the turkey bacon or whatever it was tasted like cardboard. Again, horrible absence of flavor. Hollandaise should catch a slight lemon flavor and bacon of any kind should be exploding with flavor.   Our server graciously took it off the check but that didn't help my breakfast hunger any.   So, yea, sorry. Don't get the hype. Won't be back.",

The corned beef hash, I can not recommend enough. Get it! Try it! My mom had chicken fried steak, which I tasted, and when we come back, I'll be getting that. The atmosphere is welcoming and artsy.

So we took an Uber from our hotel and landed at this very fun breakfast and lunch spot.  The service is very friendly and swift.  Although, we were there in between breakfast and lunch and didn't experience the huge crowds as so many other reviewers had.  The food is very fresh and cooked perfectly.  I had a standard 2 eggs poached with smoked bacon and their house potatoes.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  The bacon was slightly greasy, but the potatoes helped with that.  They were spiced and cooked crispy, just the way I like them.  A bit pricey I thought, but overall a great meal.",

Even the timely service of when we got our breakfast served was far from complaining about. I just wished the waiters smiled a bit more and were a smidge enthusiastic to serve us. It's weird because they were very attentive but not the friendliest.   We strolled in here on an early Friday morning. The place was pretty busy for a weekday. I can only image how packed it gets on the weekends. There was plenty of seating so we were sat right away. We ordered drinks and breakfast not long after we got seated. When our drinks came, the waitress didn't drop off straws. So I asked her if we could get straws, and she said she'd have to look to see if they had any left. Right. Ok. So why did the people that sat down after us get straws. Interesting. Any who I wasn't gonna make a fuss about straws. We were here for the breakfast.   I ordered the pancakes with sausage plate. My bf ordered his own plate also. I figured we could share the pancakes. Geez these pancakes were as thick as an old dirty novel! It came with three and I could only eat one. I loved the cute little syrup jars they served with the cakes too. Delish. They were pretty good. I could care less for the sausage. It was pretty fatty.",

The sandwich was definitely my favorite; the truffle flavor could've been stronger, but either way the sandwich tasted delicious! My least favorite was probably the shrimp & grits; the shrimp was yummy but the grits seemed water down.  Service was very quick and friendly.  Not sure how difficult parking normally is, but there were plenty of metered parking spots on the street.  Overall, the food was yummy and the service was good.

I am not sure if they purposely not put salt or pepper on the chicken friend steak but neither mine or my friends had it. The steak is cooked well, non-greasy, crispy, but utterly devoid of flavor. The gravy was cooked well but it did not have salt either. It had bits of bacon in it I believe and sausage. I don't eat high sodium, heck i am the green soy sauce guy at sushi restaurants, but I would like a little seasoning.  The potatoes and eggs were cooked well.  The place was not busy when we went at 10ish. But no one came to refill my water. I don't need a straw in my glass but the common trend is that tall glasses of ice water generally come with an Earth polluting straw. $16 for an unseasoned chicken fried steak. Pass.  The place is friendly but subpar service is just a turnoff. Go to Denny's and give the server a bigger tip from the money you save from Eat.",

I've heard good things about this place over the years & finally made it here with some friends when I came home for the weekend. In summary - this place is simple, intimate, and a great staple in DTLV for both locals and tourists.  I had the truffled egg sandwich and omg it was sooo yummy. I'm a big fan of breakfast sandwiches, and this one was delicious and different than most I've had. It was flavorful and the mushrooms, to my surprise, were a good addition to the sandwich. I'm thinking about it right now and my mouth is watering.  The service was SO quick despite a busy Sunday brunch. I was very impressed. Food came out quickly and they moved the lines fast. Eat is located downtown so parking is a challenge but there are parking meters all around the restaurant.  I think what made me fall in love more with this place is hearing about Chef Natalie's story. She was on the CW documentary 'My Last Days' that featured a Vegas local with a terminal illness (I since then learned that's how La'Kat's deviled eggs came to be). The authenticity, the passion, and the vision behind Chef Natalie's story is inspiring & I think we are lucky to have her in our Vegas community. I'll definitely be back here.",

Love the little succulents on the table - adds a whole new vibe.  - Restaurant is relatively big (also has patio), nice for small groups. But gets pretty busy during peak hours (nice waiting area available) - Staff were attentive, fast with order and very friendly  Food - Ordered an ice coffee. Love they used a paper straw, very environmentally friendly compared to plastic. Ice coffee was nice, smooth and blends well with the milk on the side. - Food ordered the Deviled Eggs. It's an appetizer, but can be a little filling for one person to eat it all. Love the little bacon bites, mixed with the eggs on top of a fried croquette. The sauce also compliments well (not exactly sure what kind of sauce it is) and it's not spicy/sweet.  Overall loved the vibe and atmosphere in the restaurant. It is not within the stripe, but if there is time - definitely check it out!",

Lucky for me I came solo because this place is very popular and had quite the wait. I was able to snag a seat at the counter (score - party of 1!). From the counter I got to enjoy the organized chaos that is the kitchen at Eat. Watching the chefs work was truly an experience. The staff were all super friendly and attentive and the food is phenomenal.  To start, I couldn't resist trying the deep fried deviled eggs. Being a midwest girl, deviled eggs are about as sacred a food as it comes. These deep fried variation made my mouth water and I devoured the four eggs they served up. Yum, yum, yum.  For my entree, I decided to try the truffle mushroom egg sandwich which also came with bacon, chives, mayo, and feta piled high on fresh ciabatta bread. The sandwich was an interesting blend of flavors but everything worked together in harmony, and I finished every last bite.  I only wish I had time to come back and visit again to try the infamous grilled cheese and tomato soup, but next time.",

The place does get pretty packed. We went on a saturday morning around 9am. We did not have to wait too long for our table , but the minute we sat down it started to get a lot more packed. There was a live singer performing, which made the environment really upbeat and livly for morning. Noise level is loud, so if you are hung over and looking for somewhere to have a quiet breakfast... that would not be here.   By far the best pancakes I've ever had. Have no regrets. No matter what you order.. ORDER THE PANKCAKES too! It comes with 3 pancakes and their AMAZING syrup. It is also topped with sausage. There was no disappointment there. I'm more of a waffle person, because I prefer it to be more crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.. well these pancakes were JUST that. Crunchy/crispy on the outside and super super soft on the inside. Gosh just writing this review now and thinking about the pancakes and making my mouth water!!  I ordered the basic, egg, bacon, potatoes plate. The potatoes were a little undercooked. The bread that comes with my plate.. OH. MY. GOSH. THE. BREAD. It wasn't just a small slice of typical white bread. no. it was a HUGE slide of white bread...IT WAS SO GOOD. It was toasted to perfection.   My hubby got the chicken fried steak was not disappointed either. But We were def moved by the pancakes.. ORDER THE PANCAKES!!!! Don't skip the precious pancakes. I wish I could eat more of it now..",

The BLT sandwich with avocado and egg is very rich and filling. If you buy it you might want to share it, unless you're really hangry and need a big meal.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed brunch at Eat in downtown Las Vegas. The menu is full of hipster versions of classic American diner foods. Take their house-made pancakes. Unlike diner pancakes, they are fluffy like pillows and instead of being served with bacon, the pancakes are paired with an organic chicken sausage.       The ambience of Eat is actually quite enjoyable. Even though the restaurant is usually jam packed, the restaurant is pretty quiet, so you can enjoy your meal and the people you are (most likely) sharing it with.       I ordered the truffled egg sandwich. It took a while until I got my food, but it was worth it. The sandwich was the perfect combination of creamy avocado, fluffy scrambled eggs, earthy mushrooms, and pungent scallions. The only complaint I have about the sandwich is about the bread. It was way too soft so my sandwich fell apart when I held it. I had to eat it with a fork and knife (the hipster way to eat sandwiches!) Instead of using such a soft bread, I recommend using a hard crusty roll or better yet, since the restaurant is \"hippy\", wrap it in collard greens.      Eat is definitely on my top 5 list of best breakfast destinations in the country.",

The decor is adorable, unique, slightly hipster. The people keep it real and give honest opinions about their menu- which is short and sweet. Their food is clean, simple, but with tastes that meld together in a satisfying manner.   The cinnamon sugar biscuits and fresh fruit compote were so amazing. The biscuits were light and fluffy, with cinnamon sugar crunchies on the bottom. The fruit was perfectly saucy, not overly sweet, with tons of fresh fruit and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Bread is thick cut (no joke) and fluffy. Chicken fried steak is well seasoned and cooked. The potatoes that come w it are perfect and seasoned so well. Tomato soup is yummmmmmmmmm. Pickles are great. Pancakes are so fluffy and light. I'm normally not a pancake eater but these were amazing!!! The syrup is real syrup and the eggs were cooked perfectly to order.   I have way too many good things to say about this place! But to sum it up, new favorite Vegas bfast spot. I'm reluctant to spread the word but it must be done. It does get super crowded on the weekends! Get there before 10am and you'll be happy. Service is great!!!  Must try's- biscuits and fresh fruit, tomato soup, country potatoes, pancakes.",

This venue has plenty of character, reminiscent of either Portland or Frisco spots, but beware, it's first come, first serve.  Prepare yourself for some downtime because it can get pretty busy during lunch hours.  It seems as if they have locked in the perfect spot right behind Container Park for when hipsters, foodies and white collars have an appetite.  The only thing they are missing as far as my concern?  Alcohol.  THE MUST TRIES: Veggie Burger Shrimp and Grits Biggnets",

I was pleasantly surprised by almost all of the places we ate, but eat. was probably my favorite.  We stumbled in here after a late Vegas night for some hungover brunch food. There was a long wait, but we were able to sit down right away at the bar. And boy, were we glad we did! We had the huevos mutalenos and the pancakes. Apparently the huevos dish was voted best hangover food in Vegas... It was delicious, the perfect blend of spicy, sweet and savory. The fried bananas were a great touch! That dish was great, but what really shocked us was how delicious the pancakes were! They were so unique too, perfectly cooked and crisp on the edges, they were the best pancakes I have ever had! So flavorful and the texture was perfect, they are huge too...no way we could finish them. Another cool thing was that the owner and chef was there working away! She's done a great job with this place, fun, creative and delicious comfort food at it's finest!  MY GO-TO DISH: I don't think you can go wrong here, but the pancakes are not to be missed! You gotta try the huevos mutalenos too. We were eyeing the country fried steak too, getting that next time!",

In that time, they seated 7 parties of 2 and 3 that came in after us. They kept assuring us that they simply needed a table large enough for us (and they couldn't possibly put two smaller tables together, for unknown reasons).  After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, two tables opened up at the same time. One was a 6 top, one was a 4 top. They tried to seat the 5 of us at the 4 top. (Side note, their 4 tops are NOT large by any means). Now, at least 2 of the other parties that came in AFTER us and were seated BEFORE us were seated at other 4 tops.   At this point we politely said no, we wanted the 6 top so we could sit comfortably. They went the consult the owner (I'm assuming she was the owner, she was a female with short curly hair who wasn't wearing the standard black uniform). The owner then rolled her eyes and, said, \"Yeah, well I want a million dollars.\" She didn't realize our party was standing directly behind her and to the left, so we were able to hear the conversation very clearly.  Isn't that lovely? After making us wait 45 minutes, we are being unreasonable by asking for a table that will actually seat all of us, when there is one available right there. They did eventually, reluctantly, seat us at the 6 top.  Pity, several members of our party were actually big fans of this place, but you can't come back from such terrible customer service. The biggest problem, honestly, was the fact that they tried to seat us at the 4 top after a 45 minute wait with an open 6 top right next to us. Several of our party has worked in food service and we understand waits taking longer sometimes due to parties sitting around chatting. But treating us like we're being demanding for wanting space to sit AFTER such a wait is unacceptable. The owner's comment was the final nail in the coffin to assure we never return. Clearly this place has no appreciation for it's customers.",

I had looked up the menu earlier to make sure they had vegetarian options and I saw a few that sounded awesome, so we went.   My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits and said \"it was my first time ever trying shrimp and grits and I'm glad I tried it at E.A.T.\" They were butterflied shrimp that looked gorgeous!  I ordered the Huevos Motulenos and I am so flippin happy I did. Seriously, I could eat this dish every day. They use bananas instead of plantains so it's a bit sweeter but it works well with the spice of the salsas on top. The potatoes that came on the side were massive and so yummy. I devoured the huge breakfast and would do it again and again and againnnn. I am actually salivating thinking about it right now.  The only reason I gave a 4 star rating was because our server didn't check on us as much as I'd like. I understand not bothering people while eating, but there was a little while that we went without drinks. Nothing too major, I would definitely come back! I plan to soon... :}",

After all only the best food attract the longest lines. I have high hopes when we finally get seated.   The menu was uniquely standard - your basic breakfast items with their own flavor.

I'm definitely not part of the Downtown chic.  Went here mid-week a couple weeks ago for lunch with a friend.  It was a chore to find a parking place, and you do have to pay for parking, but it IS downtown, so that is to be expected.  We had a 10-15 minute wait I think for a table for 2.   The place was tiny, and the tables are packed in.  This makes the ambiance what I would call 'Uncomfortably close and LOUD'.  My friend and I both were like 'whew' when we left and got out of the wall of sound.  The food was plentiful but nothing special.  My friend said hers was 'okay... nothing to write home about'.  Service was lacking.  Don't expect to be asked if you want a refill on your drink.    I was pretty unimpressed, but then again, I am not 'hip'.",

Food is good. Yes.   The decor is lovely. Neato seating, and those groovy incandescent lights with the warm looking filaments the whole bit.   Here's the thing. When it is busy in there, it is loud... VERY LOUD!!   Hard painted concrete floors and a hard ceiling painted black.  When the place is packed, it is rough to enjoy the conversations you're having with the people at your table. There comes a certain point where enough people leave after a rush and you realize that there is background music just below the noise floor of the very loudest rush so it never settles down completely there volume-wise.   I've never had a single experience there where I've been completely happy at the end.   I'd love if they spent a few bucks on some black acoustic treatment on the ceiling to match the decor. It would absorb so much of that hard edged uncomfortable noise and make it a place I would come back to and really truly recommend to my friends.",

Definitely looking forward to trying more! Oh, and the staff was not only friendly with us but had really great camaraderie. Helping each other out naturally. You don't see that warmth a whole lot. The owner came over after our meal to chum up some conversation and I LOVED that he did that. We were in a bit of a hurry because we were supposed to be marching in a parade and \"detoured\" if you will, but him taking the time to try and learn who we were was ultra impressive.",

    "text": "This is a great local restaurant, and the food is excellent. The service is friendly and fast. This is a small joint, though, so if you come on a weekend expect it to be very crowded (I've only ever visited on the weekend so I'm not sure what it looks like on weekdays)! It is much easier to get a table if you have a smaller party (think 2 or 3). I'm not sure that I would ever try to bring a group here for brunch, because you'd have to wait such a long time!  The food is really great. The last time we visited I tried the 'blta' - a blt with avocado, but man, is it good! It came with tomato soup which was very, very good. My husband got their truffled-egg sandwich (can't remember the exact name) and was extremely pleased with it. Both times we have been to eat we have left very full and very happy with our meal!  The prices are a little higher, but you are practically downtown, and the quality of the good is just so good that it is worth it. The menu had changed since the last time we had visited, so I'm sure there will always be something new to try! Honestly, I probably would have given this place five stars if it wasn't such a bother to get a table!",

    "text": "Was staying close by for the past week and for some reason kept skipping this place- Big Mistake! Went for the Cinnamon Biscuits the next to last morning. Talked myself out of them because I was afraid they would be too much (many). Big Mistake/Convenient excuse. Got the Truffled Scrambled Egg Sandwich- WHOA!! I was slightly disappointed in myself for ordering something so...\"safe\". Heh, perfection is NOT safe. There was nothing in there that I couldn't/haven't prepared before for myself BUT this was seriously delicious and well balanced. I like spicier food or interesting combinations but this sandwich was on point. I would have it again and wholeheartedly recommend it to less adventurous friends. HOWEVER, the hash browns....I spent pretty much each bite trying to determine why they were so good and how I can make mine as delicious. Not spicy like some places, but very flavorful. Soft but crispy, NOT greasy like so many others. Thick but cooked through and the few onions were perfectly cooked to coincidence. I'm not lying, I'm from the South and I've eaten and cooked hash browns my entire life but these really were that perfect and I almost feel like a dork going on about them!  While contemplating my egg sandwich and hash browns, the couple next to me ordered and received the Cinnamon Biscuits. So not as intimidating. I was afraid they'd be huge- nope, normal size biscuits. Made a plan right then and there to return the next morning after checking out from my hotel. Quick note on the coffee- no fancy table presentation but just a good, well balanced cup of joe. Not strong but not bitter either. A really good coffee choice. I almost asked for a cup to go but thought I'd try a nearby coffee shop- Big Mistake!! Went to the other place, crap coffee and it was barely warm!!! Did not finish- should've taken it back but I was in such a contented state from my eat. experience I just dumped it.  Next day- Cinnamon Biscuit Day! Ran over from hotel. To spare the details- I ordered the biscuits minus the powdered sugar, with the compote on the side. I feared sugary overload for something which should stand alone. I also got a side Chicken Apple Sausage. Alone, the Cinnamon Biscuits are very, very good. Delicious in fact. I pride myself on my traditional Southern biscuits, which these are not, but a tasteful alternative. NOW, with the compote (as designed)-SLAP MY MAMA!! So, so, SO good and the flavors don't clash, they totally compliment if not reinforce. Fresh berries accompany. Great concept and execution. Even better than I expected! I can wholeheartedly recommend the Chicken Apple Sausage, also. Split and grilled, not greasy and went great with the sweet of the biscuits. Learning from yesterday's mistake, I asked for a to go cup for the awesome coffee.   Two times service, both early morning before the crowds- exceptional- especially for Vegas. Seated quickly, someone at my table moments after seating for my drink order, quick turn and back with recommendations and helpful advice for my food order. Food turnaround both days was super quick. For a town known for ambivalent service at best, this place gets it. I was recognized the second day and thanked for returning. So nice to be appreciated as a customer.   Exceptional menu, superior execution, great service, fair pricing. That's a five for me.",

We were sat immediately and we were greeted kindly for our drink requests. Our waiter Gary was very friendly with us and struck conversation with us. He recommended to us some specials and favorites.   I ended up ordering the Downtown Benedict with a short stack of pancakes. Our food came out within 15 minutes and surprisingly, it was more food than I expected. It definitely looked like it would be a challenge, especially with my pancakes, but needless to say, mission accomplished. Everything in the Downtown Benedict fit so well together from the tomato to the hollandaise sauce. The potatoes that the dish comes with were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, with grilled onions, perfection. The pancakes were cooked well, and the simple fact that it was served with 100% pure maple syrup made it all that much more delicious. I had a great time with the food, staff, and parking even though it was all downtown. I can see where parking can be a mess and how easily it can become busy, but I didn't have to deal with any of that luckily and I'll be sure to come early in the morning next time!",

Not only was our waitress rude, condescending, unwelcoming, and clearly hated her job but the service was slow and the fact that there was no options for vegans was disappointing to say the least. When I asked the waitress if there was any vegan options she rudely stated \"we have salad.\"  Clearly she had no idea what vegan meant as the salad on the menu had animal products in it.  I had to settle for a $7 bowl of oatmeal which they served to me with carmelized apples/pecans (carmelization requires the use of butter...an animal byproduct) which irritated me to no end as I already stated I was vegan and ordered it plain.  We were also never offered refills on our water or coffee, and halfway through our meal our waitress abandoned our table and never came back.  The staff has no regard for your concerns. The four of us agreed we will definitely not be going back.",

When the server who was missing for most of the meal, asked if she wanted to take it to go, she said no and recommended that she not tell people to order it anymore because it was not good.

I ordered the Free Range Chicken Fresh mozzarella, tomato, greens and pesto mayo on ciabatta with house-made chips, a friend ordered the DWBLT Smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado with chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough, and our other friend ordered the Killer Grilled Cheese Aged cheddar on sourdough with kick-ass tomato soup - the menu online says salad, but it was a nice big bowl of tomato soup. We purposely ordered different items so that we could try them all.  They were all delicious, fresh, and made with quality ingredients. The house-made chips are a must, they are crispy, with some kind of parmesan, chive, garlic seasoning, delish!!! My favorite was the DWBLT, it is huge!! and the sourdough bread is toasted just right! The grill cheese and tomato soup was also great! The bowl of soup is large, the meal itself is very filling. Good portions for the price. My chicken sandwich was also very good, I wish the ciabatta bread was toasted a bit more, but that is just my personal preference, the bread was fresh. I couldn't really taste the pesto mayo, it could of used a bit more. Overall the food was awesome! A great find in this new downtown! It is a small restaurant, a bit loud, but the ambiance and decor makes it so hip! There is a cute long bar height table in the middle for a larger party. There is also a very nice looking courtyard for outdoor seating! I can't wait to go back for their breakfast. Overall, our experience was great, there was a bit of a wait for our server to approach our table and take our orders, our food did take sometime.. but I guess that's what happens when you eat at place that makes it all fresh! We walked there from my office - I do see how parking could be a bit of a hassle.. Just bring coins for the meters or park and walk a few blocks away! Don't let the construction across the street or the surronding buildings fool you, this is a must if you are looking for a place to eat downtown!! Wish they would deliver!!",

We had no idea we couldn't use more than 2 cards and there was no point of her yelling at our table and showing how sad and ungrateful she was for anyone dining there. She ruined our entire experience here. I would never come back because of the way she approached us and even was rude until we left by talking to other patrons about us. So rude.",

Good portion size not too much and not too little. Friendly staff, clean and quaint atmosphere.",

My wife doesn't drink black coffee and after being convinced by our server she ordered it. She loved it and also bought a bag of the coffee beans. A little pricey at $15 but it is great to support a local business. We started with an order of beignets. They were absolutely amazing. Light, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Served along side a strawberry preserve and flavored cream cheese. It was delicious together and by itself. A definite must have. I ordered the chicken fried steak and a side pancake (another recommendation by our server). The steak was filled with gristle and hard to cut and chew. This took away from my enjoyment of the dish. The batter was light and crispy. The big plus was the gravy, absolutely delicious. Creamy with chunks of sausage, perfectly balanced, not overly creamy it oily. They claimed to have the best pancake. It was served with pure maple syrup. It looked like it was cooked in a cast iron skillet. It had crispy edges and a fluffy center. It was an absolutely perfect pancake. Next time I'm ordering just the pancake stack. This is a definite place to stop by any time you're in Vegas for breakfast or brunch.",

The shrimp and grits were a little bland and made watery by the fresh tomatoes in the dish; also, I found a clot or two of grits in my entree (~$11).  The side of one pancake was delightful (~$3).  It was light and fluffy and just what I expected of a pancake.  The chilaquiles were a-ok (~$11).  I wish they used thicker corn chips though.  The panko crusted deviled eggs were good (a special and not on the menu, ~$8).  The corned beef hash was pretty great and definitely didn't come out of a can (~$11).   Other important info: service was great, located in downtown, metered street parking, trendy/hipster joint, closed early, everything tastes like it was homemade and made from scratch.",

Roast Beef - blue cheese, wild mushrooms, picked red onions, arugula, with mayo on ciabatta. Roast beef was tender and moist. The mushrooms were a great addition and added a nice sweetness.

Myself and 2 other friends came after the Color Run. I was really worried the wait would be super long from the other color runners, we were told it would be half an hour, but it only ended up being 15 minutes. I already knew I wanted the chicken fried steak since it had good reviews and looked delicious from the pictures on here. I also ordered passion tea, which was okay I wish I would of ordered the strawberry drink instead. I was very pleased with the chicken fried steak, the breading was well seasoned and it was a huge piece, a sharable portion. The gravy and seasoned potatoes went with it pretty well too. I ordered the house made chips instead of eggs and I was really disappointed because they look good in the pictures but didn't have the texture I was hoping for. I also had the English muffin as my side, which was nothing spectacular. My 2 other friends both ordered the chilaquiles scrambled eggs, they were both kinda whatever about it because they didn't expect it to be vegetarian. I did I have a bite and liked it, but I always welcome vegetarian options in my diet.  The inside is awesome, hipster type of fare I must say. I cannot wait to come back, I just don't know what I'll order because everything else looks so delicious.",

The atmosphere is nice, but the service and food are mediocre at best. My party of 3 arrived and were met with a line where no one had been asked for names or the number of people in their party yet. The hostess milled around and offered no explanation. We waited 30 minutes even though there were several empty tables. Again, the hostess offered no explanation. A party of two who came in after three other parties of two-three people was seated prior to us because they asked to sit at the counter (which was never offered as an option to the parties who arrived before). Once the food came, the hostess approached and asked if we needed boxes for our food before we'd taken a collective five bites. We waited about thirty minutes for our check after asking two different people: this was weird because they obviously needed the table...",

It came recommended by my roommate as somewhere to try for brunch, so we made it a point to go as our last meal of the trip. The place was definitely busy, and for a group of 4 on a Sunday around noon, it was a good 15-20 minute wait at least? The food was worth it though. The portions are generous and the price is inexpensive! I got the grilled cheese and asked them to shove a side of bacon into it, and they were more than happy to accommodate me! Think 2 huge french toast slides grilled to crispy golden perfection, but still incredibly soft on the inside, with a big pile of crispy bacon with yummy cheddar cheese in the middle! The thing was huge, I only needed half of the sandwich to fill up! It came with a yummy tomato salad on the side, and if you know me, tomatoes, bacon and grilled cheese is possibly the best combination ever. I also tried their pancakes, and for $9 you get 3 huge fluffy pancakes that are serious some of the fluffiest melt in your mouth pancakes I've tasted! Definitely worth the price!  Staff are friendly and the restaurant is dog friendly too! Love love love!",

If I had to guess it's origin, I'd say Cuba (but maybe somewhere in Central America, because people tend to liken Cuban foods with blandness). It was an unlikely mix of eggs, black beans, PEAS, and sauteed bananas. Crazy, right? Well, it worked!   I should have asked for more tortillas. It was a shame to let that salsa and yolk return to the Earth. One of the reasons I made the decision to come back was that the coffee and juice are fresh and definitely on point. Didn't need to add anything to the coffee, so that says a lot.   The only reason that I didn't rate all five stars is that there is no free parking (Downtown blues, ugh) and they open at 8am. It's hard to consider it an actual breakfast place when it opens halfway into breakfast time. ;)   Great job, guys! I'll be eating at eat again, that's for sure.",

The sandwich was nice and thick and the cheese was nice and melty. I felt a bit ridiculous eating hot soup when it was 100+ degrees out, but I do love tomato soup and ended up scarfing down the whole thing.  The shrimp and grits were good as well and the pancakes came with sausages which was a nice touch. I've never had a chicken fried steak I've liked, so I'm a bad judge as to how the one at eat. compares but the guy who ordered it had no complaints. Our waitress was extremely hospitable as well!

We started off with the cinnamon biscuits and berries- a must try! They tasted as good as they looked. The strawberry sauce was not overpoweringly sweet; it was just right. Since it was Good Friday and I don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent, had the steelcut oats which had sugared pecans, strawberries, and apples. Not too sweet, and a large portion. My husband had the chilaquiles which looked, and according to him, tasted amazing! I was a little envious. We would definitely return!",

    "text": "Eat is a new restaurant one block east and one block south of the El Cortez.  First of all, I don't care much for the name.  Too clever by half.  But I'm here for the grub, so I'll overlook the too trendy, too cute name.  Dined at Eat early on a weekday morning, there were only three other customers.  This gave me a chance to talk with my server, the manager, and the owner.  Everyone was very nice.  Sat at the counter and ordered the huevos motulenos.  They tasted fabulous (lots of flavor going on here!) and the presentation was perfect.  The manager DID make the chef re-plate my food and made sure I saw him do it, which was kind of pretentious in retrospect.  The space feels urban and trendy and doesn't fit in with the run down (but improving) neighborhood surrounding the restaurant.  I'll be back, hopefully for brunch.  Lots of interesting items on the menu.  You should try it.  ---------------------------  Here's an actual conversation I had with a Middle-Aged Lady with Wild Hair (MALWWH) on my way back to Fremont.  I was about to cross the street against the light.  MALWWH:  Hey, don't do that! Me:  What? MALWWH:  Don't cross against the light!  The cops will arrest you and take you to jail, and they won't let you go until you give them $35. Me:  Really? MALWWH:  Yeah.  Like the cops don't have anything better to do.  Don't they see all the f-ing crackheads around here? Me:  Well, it wouldn't be that big of a deal - I've got $35. MALWWH:  Don't tell anyone you have $35...they'll take it from you! Me:  LOL",

Turns out Yelpers love this place, and why wouldn't they?   The location is off the beaten path, just in the outskirts of Fremont street situated on the corner of an obscure corner of LV.  We walked to the restaurant from the Golden Nugget and we were second guessing our sense of direction. However, when we saw a line and more people heading toward the corner we knew we had reached our destination.    The wait was a litttttle on the ridiculous side. But, we were finally seated and the waiter was really nice and friendly. Everything we ordered was delicious. The first round of coffee was blegh, but they redeemed themselves on the second round.  Don't expect to get your mimosa fix at the restaurant though, no alcohol served.",

Some of the best in Las Vegas (stiff completion with DuPar's and Babystacks).  Pancakes are as good as advertised.  Golden brown, crispy edges, well cooked middle, fresh-tasting batter.  Nice touch serving real maple syrup and a seasonal fruit garnish.  Unfortunately, the chicken fried steak I had didn't live up to expectations.  The meat had tough spots that made it hard to cut and eat.  The gravy is not the classic white gravy I like, but a brown gravy with a green herb and scallions (?).  The gravy had plenty of sausage, but the green herbs/scallions dominated the flavor...which I disliked.  I think it was fried in a fryer, while I prefer my chicken-fried steak be pan fried.  I would stick with the pancakes or try one of their unique breakfast dishes on my next visit.  The place is somewhat pricey ($9 for three pancakes and a sausage).",

I felt slightly dubious, but the first bite blew all my doubts out the water. This sandwich is a perfect mix of sweet, spicy, and salty, with perfect texture. The chef has mastered the transformation and balance of fresh ingredients and demonstrates it well with this simple, unassuming sandwich bursting with flavor. My wife ordered the chicken fried steak and my mother in law ordered the corn beef hash. My son got a single pancake and applewood sausage. Everything was excellent, but I felt my sandwich was exceptional. I highly recommend this place.",

Strawberries, pecans, feta, and onions. The option was available to add chicken or shrimp, but they were not necessary. The salad was perfect! The best thing I got, and I would enjoy to get it again, or get these ingredients and make the salad at home. Don't use to much of the dressing though :-) I also got the two egg  meal. I got them poached. Delightful eggs, amazing toast, and a perfect amount of potatoes. Bacon is crispy, and well made. The service was quick, they brought everything out to my friend and I in rounds, ( we each got 3 things). The things were placed in front of us with perfect timing between meals, and the busses were on top of clearing the table.

My husband went for the chicken fried steak. It was huge and fantastic! Crunchy coating, meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was one of the best I've tasted. Served with potatoes this is a belly buster for sure. I opted for the Shrimp Po boy...good choice! Absolutely delicious. No fried or bay shrimp here. This was large juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp in an excellent tangy dressing. Served with freshly made potato chips this was enough for two...but I ate the whole thing...I couldn't help myself.

We had asked our waitress multiple times for iced tea and water, and she kept forgetting. Plus, we were only checked on 3 times from when we sat down, to when we left. But all around, this is a great place to eat downtown. Great environment and friendly staff.",

    "text": "By BF decided to try this spot out on our last morning in Vegas. And I am so glad we did. We went on a Sunday...mid morning. I was expecting a huge wait. Considering this was prime brunch hours we ended up waiting 30 minutes, which isn't too bad. coffee was excellent! I love a good cup of joe. My BF ordered the corn beef hash. It came with poached eggs and these lovely pieces of toast that was oh so good. I got the golden brown pancakes which were sooooooo good. I love the buttery golden brown crust that they had. I honesty didn't need syrup as the cake themselves was bursting with sweetness. I would have given a 5 star rating however the service could have been a lot better. Our waitress only came by once, and the person who took our orders was the bartender....which i thought was weird.",

Well worth the trip Downtown (just make sure the cabbies don't rip you off, which they're better at doing than driving).    We had the green chile posole and wedge salad and both were very tasty with high-quality ingredients. The posole had just the right amount of spice and had ample, good-quality meat.  Both portion sizes were very generous and appropriate to the price, which was reasonable. The service was quick, friendly, and attentive.  The decor of this place is refreshingly normal and clean-looking.  It's about the furthest thing you'll find from typical LV fare, which is tailor made for either poseur high-roller wannabes or smokers on oxygen tanks with no remaining sense of taste.  My only regret is that we didn't have the opportunity to try more dishes or come back for breakfast. If you're in Vegas, GO.",

She has an amazing sense of savory and texture and of course chooses to serve up high quality ingredients to her patrons.   Whether you order Shirmp and Grits, Benedict or just plain old eggs, you will be served up the most delicious morning experience of  'wonderfulness'.  The atmosphere has an urban/rustic feel to it with a splash vintage elegance.  My only complaint is that  EAT is not open for dinner -- serving breakfast.  lol.  Parking is off street, easy and convenient. It isn't uncommon to see the proprietor enjoying fresh air seated on the bench in front of this gem of a restaurant.",

Then after he brought our food out, he kept walking past us over and over like we didn't exist. When we finally asked for the check and a bag, he seemed very annoyed like we were bothering him....mind you he never checked on us once. This was extremely disappointing because I suggested this place to my mom for a celebration breakfast she wanted to take me to (based on a past experience I had here which was great) and Gary completely ruined it. We did mention it to the manager, and she did apologize, but this is so unacceptable. I work in the service industry and you just don't behave this way. If it's that hard to behave like a decent human being at work, do yourself a favor and get out of the customer service industry. I'm paying for a great experience all around, not for someone to act like I'm bothering them at home. Get real. Ugh! So sad this happened, we really wanted to enjoy it because the food is good, but I'll think twice about coming back now.",

Eggs were nice and runny just how I like. the shrimp was the star of the dish.  it was a little garlicky, a little smokey, and quite juicy.  however it only came with 6 pieces.  Shrimp po boy  - Yummy shrimp with a bit of heat, with crispy bread and a pickle and veggies in the middle. the potato salad that came with it was very plain. there was super salty chip stuck in the middle of it. Weird how some thing have flavors and others don't  Service was great!  I felt very well taken care of and the staff was very nice  The food itself was OK and just a little bit above average overall (i would say 3.5 stars), however due to great service i'd have to give this place a 4 due to awesome service!  maybe next time i'll wake up early for their breakfast!",

The restaurant was half full and despite there being a plethora  of places to sit we were sat at a tiny two top.  When we asked if we could sit on the other side of the restaurant we were told \"it is reserved for when we get busy\" not the welcome that one would expect for a little boutique spot.    I ordered the pancakes which came with a tiny jar of maple syrup and one packet of butter.  Almost laughable.  When I asked our waiter if I could have more he looked a bit taken aback like I had belched in his face.  He wasn't extremely friendly but he was helpful telling my girlfriend to not order the shrimp and grits over the chilaquiles.  The chilaquiles were much better than my pancakes.    When we were about half way through our meal our server unceremoniously dropped the check on our table.  Having been a server in one of my many past lives, I don't care for having the bill brought before I ask for it.    The pancakes did reheat well, which I enjoyed with an abundance of butter and maple syrup when I ate them at home.",

Not worth $14 either.",

    "text": "It's funny reading other Yelp reviews about how this place is located in a sketchy part of the neighborhood makes me think these people must not have been to the older version of the Lower East Side in New York City. True, this part of Las Vegas isn't part of the Strip and it doesn't have the frills of big hotels and casinos - but that's the beauty of Downtown. I love that the restaurants around here still carries the vibe of old Las Vegas.   Eat is no exception - it's located on the corner of an old apartment complex. The decor is very unpretentious nor is it trying to be hipster. It's very clean with an open kitchen concept. The staff is friendly and so is the owner, Natalie.   We came here on a Sunday morning, expecting a long wait. I guess we came at a perfect time because everyone else must have been asleep or something coz there was no line at all. The bar counter had seats available which was perfect coz that's where we preferred to sit anyway.   We ordered the Corned Beef Hash, the Strawberry Biscuits and BLT with tomato salad.  The corned beef was really good - just the right balance of saltiness and it was also quite tender. Also I liked that it didn't have too much potatoes. I could also tell that they source their bread from a good purveyor coz I loved how their sour dough tasted. I took a bite of my friend's BLT - delish!  And I'm finicky about the coffee in breakfast places coz 8 out 10 places don't serve good coffee. This place certainly cares about the coffee they serve their patrons. Love their coffee!  I take mine decaf - but it was still full bodied. It's really good, they even have them in packages for people to buy!  Reviewers complaining about the prices being high - I don't really care about that. I would much rather spend money on good food than waste a few dollars on lousy food. This place doesn't take shortcuts on preparing their food and the ingredients that they use. And that takes money hence the price is reflective of that. Now if they charged high and served crappy food, that's another story.   This place is certainly worth my money. I shall be back.",

The potatoes were not very good either overcooked with burnt chips scattered throughout.   The Huevos was an unusual combination and probably good if you like the strange combination of flavors.  We should have read the menu more closely, the peas were out of place. Unfortunately, this will not be our new goto breakfast spot :(",

    "text": "I heard great things about this place and really wanted to like it, but it disappointed me, both in food and service.  The location didn't bother me as it seemed to bother other reviewers. You have to pay for parking which is inconvenient if you don't have change, but I was willing to do that if the food was good. Sadly, it wasn't.  First of all our server was very aggressive. He put his hand on the back of my chair and leaned in close to my personal space. He creeped me out. I appreciate friendliness but I don't appreciate you getting really close to me. My husband noticed it right away too.  We had coffee while waiting for our order. It wasn't horrible or anything- I've had much worse- but it tasted over extracted, like they were skimping on the amount of coffee used to brew it. At $3 a cup (yep, $6 in total for two mugs of coffee), it should taste better than that.  My husband ordered shrimp & grits and he loved it. He ordered it because that's the dish he heard others raving about.  I ordered the eggs benedict and holy moly, the sauce was SOUR! Not a good kind of sour either. The bacon was also limp and chewy. Yes, it was turkey bacon, which I eat at home all the time, but it didn't even taste like it was cooked. It was really gross.  The serving size was small, but that wouldn't have bothered me if the food actually tasted good. I don't like stuffing myself with huge portions at breakfast, but it's hard to not feel ripped off when you paid $13 for english muffins with limp bacon and sour hollandaise sauce.  The ambience was cool and hipster-ish. I think it's cool that they let their waiters have tattoos and dyed hair, but that doesn't make the food taste better or the waiter less creepy. Also the music was far too loud, my husband and I could barely have a conversation.  Final verdict: waste of money for now. The place is new, maybe they'll work the kinks out. If they changed a few things this place could be great but I'm not returning for now.",

The homemade potato chips were very good, the coffee was nice and strong, the owner was walking around saying/smiling hello at people.  My suggestion would be to punch up the flavor of the tofu banh mi.  I am always appreciative when there is a vegan option at restaurants.  I ordered the tofu banh mi veganized and it was pretty plain.  My lunch mates enjoyed their chicken sandwich, salad and grilled cheese.  It's a great restaurant with huge potential.  A soy milk option for the coffee and oatmeal would also be great too!  It's always nice to support a new local business, go eat at Eat everyone!",

They were closing at 2pm, but we arrived at 1pm and were able to be seated right away! I ordred the corned beef hash, and my friend had the truffled egg sandwich. I really enjoyed the corn beef hash, it came with four large pieces of buttered sourdough, and a decently sized portion of corned beef hash.   The food wasnt overly salty or anything, and it tasted great with some tapatio, cholula on it.  My corned beef hash was $14, which was a bit pricey, but I think its still more worth it than eating at some overplaced restaurant on the strip.  I also like to support businesses in fremont street since fremont street gets less traffic than the strip.   GO to donut bar after!!",

My friend and I shared the deviled eggs and cinnamon biscuits which are memorable. I would come back for those alone. The special that day was prime rib hash and it was AMAZING! Basic breakfast of eggs and bacon was also really good. The chef lives there locally and was present in the kitchen. She checked on the guests personally which was just awesome to see. This place is definitely worth stopping in and it's a nice break from the busyness of the strip.",

I had the eggs Benedict and my Wife had the oatmeal, both of which were great, but the service was stellar!  Service can be tricky and a lot of places can't seem to get their staff to team well at all (Waitstaff will not help each other out), but that isn't the case with Eat, they have their steaming down pat.

The shrimp was good, well seasoned, & the bacon was too soggy. The Pancakes were pretty good. I did enjoy the crispy outside of them. Although, I found them to be a little too thick they are flavorful.   Our service was sub-par and our waiter didn't come to check on Us during our breakfast.

You'll get the sense that this is more of a neighborhood restaurant and more of a passion for the people who work there.   We had about a 20 minute wait and sat outside watching hipsters wander back and forth which is always entertaining. The streets were quiet due to an upcoming iHeart Radio event which made other businesses in the area a bit tense but not the people at EAT.  Service was fast and many people came by our little party of three asking if everything was ok. They were very patient when I had to run out to take a call and I appreciated that. We ordered the two eggs with potatoes, cinnamon biscuits, grilled cheese sandwich and the BLT. Everything was perfectly made, hot and fresh.   The sourdough bread was a hit as it was thick cut and surprisingly light. The potatoes were very well seasoned and the bacon a delight. Cinnamon biscuits were light and fluffy with a strawberry sauce and powdered sugar and blueberries. We plan to go back every time we are in town.   Get off the strip and have some good food.

They do not have mimosas either if you are looking for a boozie brunch. But it has excellent food and service!   I got the BLT sandwich with tomato soup and both were very delicious and refreshing. It is hefty with the bread, but evens out well with the amount of bacon, lettuce and tomato.   We didn't wait long for our waiter to get to us and waited about 10 minutes for our food.   We don't come here very often, as it is downtown Vegas, but when we do it is worth it!",

Didn't introduce himself, came up to us and said \"what?\" when we asked a busser to get our waiter. He was then clearly rude to that poor girl - you could tell by body language. Anyways - this would be a 5 star, but GARY ruined it all!! I do not think that Gary should be in any customer service type of position! To the EAT Owners & Management - get rid of him!!

The breakfast menu looks to be about as good as it gets in Vegas and for the price its just right. The menu is nothing out of the ordinary on the surface but the details are filled with love.  I got a the roast beef with with blue cheese. The details are the  wild mushrooms, pickled red onions and arugula, It was perfect. I wish I had also had the BLT with avocado, it looked so good, were going to have to go back.

We went our first morning in Vegas (7/18/15) and was told it'd be a 45 minute wait. We were starving and had things we wanted to do so we decided to go somewhere else and come back the next day. I am SO glad we did. My wife and I had the chef's special which was eggs benedict with avocado and other stuff (you had me at avocado). It was freakin' delicious. My son was with us and he had the Huevos Montulenos - honestly, I think they should take that off the menu. He seemed to like it okay but I had a bite and didn't care for it at all. Neither did my wife. The place is kinda hipster and the service is excellent. I think this place has overtaken first spot from Peppermill as our favorite breakfast place in Vegas. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "What up, Downtown?  First of all, let's start with the location and restaurant.  Located in the downtown area and within walking distance from the Fremont Experience.  For someone that is not familiar with the area, it can easily be missed since it's literally below some apartments.  Just remember that it's at the corner of Carson & 7th.  The outside and inside brings me back home.  This establishment reminds me of the historic North Park area of San Diego where restaurants, cafes, and stores sit below apartments.    I met fellow Yelper Terri R for breakfast and we were both ready to chow down.  The menu is as simple as it gets.  No folding laminated menu, just a one page sheet.  Everything looked good, but I decided on the Smoked Salmon. Yes, fish for breakfast.  Besides, I was going to have eggs for lunch.   The Smoked Salmon is served with tomatoes, cream cheese, and rye bread.  I have to admit, this is one of the best raw salmons that I've had in a while. Seasoned just right, thinly cut, and not fishy at all.    I thought that the staff was as good as it gets.  They were attentive and kept our drinks filled.  The owner was also around making her rounds.  But what I noticed is that she was genuine and sincere with her guests.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when you're in a middle of a conversation and a waiter/waitress interrupts you.  Our waiter was great with his timing and was around when he was needed.  Kudos Eat!!!  I will definitely be back because there's still more that I need to try.  My only regret...I forgot to try their Beignets.    TIP:  Bring some Quarters for the parking meters outside.",

The place was about half full, but most of that was a large group that pushed together 3 tables in the middle of the place.  It's not huge, but has a patio which seemed nice, although I ate inside the restaurant.    Service was very quick.  I had the shrimp po boy.  I'll say, I was excited to try the chicken fried steak.  I had heard great things and was the reason I went.  But, they stop serving breakfast at 11:00 or so.  So, that was a disappointment.    I was fortunate, because the po boy was excellent.  The ciabatta was maybe the softest version of this roll I've ever eaten.  Despite this, it held up to the toppings.  It wasn't overflowing with shrimp, but you got shrimp in about 85% of the bites.  The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the sauce was spicy.  They should bottle it, it added so much.  The homemade potato chips were good, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, very cool atmosphere.  Friendly people and a great lunch.  I'll have to get downtown earlier to try the CFS for breakfast...",

It's located on a cute corner with benches outside of people waiting to eat. They only open a few hours for brunch & the menu is limited but incising. The inside is sleek, very design forward but all the waiters make it casual. Had a very LA type of feel. Our male waiter was nice, in a rush I felt tho. At least my water was filled at all times. I went for the eggs Benedict that wasn't on the menu that our server said right before we ordered Their potatoes were good & the eggs Benedict was awesome. Flavorful but yet still nice and consistent with the rest of the dish. We waited about 15 minutes until the hostess came over and took our check, not sure where our waiter was the entire time we ate & finished. We left filled and happy. The wait time went by quickly which was nice I will say tho, for those picky eaters this is not the best place to bring. Very limited & no sides. I wish some plates came with your casual eggs & pancakes but that's not the case here. It's a good spot if you have an open pallet!",

I was sick so I thought it was just me not being able to taste my food. So I had my boyfriend try my food and he said he couldn't taste anything either.

I had the Huevos Motulenos (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lHdja9&s=022bd024109c02e8293dd64ca7227e069b47dc6c5157a0339260c78e0ee085b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lHdja9</a>) The overall flavor profile was pretty good though the sweetness of the bananas definitely stood out. It probably would be a bit better with plantains instead of bananas. It was an interesting dish and I certainly enjoyed it but I did find the bananas a bit overwhelming.  We also had the Deviled Eggs (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2CFVBLz&s=4072997075eba208630deedcc78471cd25b89ee72fd860213e19b43f7910d264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2CFVBLz</a>) Each egg half was deep fried with panko crumbs. The yolk had small strips of bacon on the top and a bit of sriracha. I thought the overall taste was solid but not quite worth $2 per 1/2 egg. The bacon flavor and texture got lost between the fried egg crust and the strong sriracha flavor.",

I ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs sunny side up runny, rye toast, coffee.   The toast was nice and thick, evenly toasted to just crisp.   Eggs, flawless. Exactly as I make them at home. Crisp golden edge, just solid white, slightly cooked thin layer of yolk, and the rest of the yolk nicely warm but runny.   The potatoes were glorious. And I don't actually like breakfast potatoes and wasn't expecting much. Really great flavor and texture. Well seasoned, but not salty.   Chicken fried steak had a magazine ready crust, crispy and delicious. The patty was juicy and tender. Again, not salty, just perfectly seasoned. The gravy was a revelation. I'm not sure I've had better country gravy. Full stop.   And lastly, holding a dear place in my heart, the piece de resistance: mothership coffee in a cup that's never empty. This alone is enough that I will always consider Eat as an option. Absolutely adore mothership, even from a coffee pot.   Very impressed. Definitely returning.",

Friendly, sincere, cheerful service folks accommodate every customer desire (well almost, keep your clothes on Bucky).   Food delivery to the table is fast after ordering.  The house coffee is good tasting.  If I have one criticism, it's that the vaunted breakfast biscuits with fruit on top ain't that yummy.  Barely more scrumptious than the kind you get out of that Pillsbury pop n' bake tube.  Overall, solid 4 star rating.  You'll like.  Go.",

The Cinnamon Biscuits are well made and complemented perfectly with the strawberry sauce. The pancakes uniquely feature their own packaged butter and syrup, a nice touch because of the quality of both items. \"Eat\" has single handed turned me on to chicken sausage. Never had it before my visit first visit now I try it whenever I see it on a menu.

Or was that just me? Sshhh.   The shrimp and grits were tasty. I really enjoyed the smooth grits the most and the salsa served with it gave it a kick you don't usually get with the mild mannered grits.   The corned beef hash was also good. The deviled eggs are kicked up a notch - the white is breaded and fried, the whole thing is topped with a squirt of siracha and slivers of smoky good bacon. That bacon. Get the bacon.   Hostess and waitress were welcoming and friendly. Sitting at the counter and watching the action was entertaining, especially seeing the boss lady calling out orders, finishing plates and containing the chaos.

Friendly staff, but no sense of time management. No one ever came and asked how we were enjoying our meal until at least 20 minutes into receiving the order. The chicken fried steak came out and the potatoes were so salty, the eggs were overcooked, and the gravy had a odd sweet flavor to it.  The corned beef hash with poached eggs also had a funny fishy taste to it. Not sure if it was the scallions in the hash or the beef itself. I only got one poached egg because the other was overcooked. The one pat of butter they served with two entrees just seemed like an after thought. The water they serve with the slice of lemon is not hiding that nasty tap flavor so we had to order a bottle of flat water. So $28 dollars later, and that's with one of the entrees removed, it was an expensive water and coffee adventure. Would never come back or recommend.",

    "text": "I cannot say enough good things about Eat, not only is the food good but the overall mission of the place is amazing. I have had both breakfast and lunch at Eat and everything that I have had is just amazing; my personal favorite is the caprese panini but truly anything that you have there is amazing. When I worked downtown we used to order take out from here quite often, they don't deliver mind you but if you call in a to go order they are always happy to do it for you.   The overall atmosphere of the place is very cozy and inviting, granted it is a small space and they are almost always busy so it can feel a bit cramped at times but its well worth it. I am very fond of places that give back to the community that they are in and Eat is no exception; this is a locally owned diner who set up shop in this neighborhood (which at that time was very much on the lower end and just becoming transitional) specifically to help with the Downtown revitalization effort. When she opened shop I can only imagine it would have been a gamble but thanks to small and large business owners like her Downtown is well on its way to restoring its former glory. I also appreciate that she displays art pieces from local artists in the diner, I think that I a very kind way to give back to the community.  In addition to Eats philanthropy in Las Vegas they also have a commitment to quality foods which is also very nice. Most of the items on the menu are organic, natural, and where possible locally grown (though to anyone who is not a local locally grown usually means California, with a few exceptions our climate out here makes farming most produce near impossible) which I love to see supporting local farmers and I am a strong advocate for the natural foods movement. SO basically Eat has amazing food which is made from good organic locally grown foods, the owners is very much involved in the community and the day to day activities of the restaurant, and they are actively involved in supporting the community that they work in; I wish more businesses would follow in Eats' example.  The only couple of downsides to eat are one they are only open for breakfast/brunch/lunch so get there before 3 so you can enjoy what they have to offer. Second the diner is very popular, fairly small, and always busy; it is not unusual for there to be a wait to be seated and at times the service can be a bit on the slow side. Finally this is just not the best area of town and parking can be scarce, so if you have to park a couple blocks down please lock your car and don't leave you valuables in view.   That said you are in for a treat",

Scrambled eggs, feta cheese and sauteed mushrooms between two fat pieces of lightly buttered sourdough bread: the Truffled Egg Sandwich. That is really all that needs to be said about Eat because this meal is so amazing!  (It is also so kick-ass that they serve it all day... yum!)  Other highlights of the meal included the coffee- a delightful bold blend with almond milk and raw sugar available!   Justin really wanted to try the chicken fried steak (which they stop serving exactly at 11am) so we ended up here for brunch on day 2 also!   This time I had a delightful cup of chamomile tea and the cinnamon apple oatmeal with strawberries. Both were great choices for a lighter breakfast!   The service was excellent and the food was consistent- I would definitely recommend this spot for an awesome brunch downtown!",

It was simply delicious and the added cheddar cheese was a good recommendation. The two poached eggs were of differing doneness though: one was a little runny and the other boiled hard. I am not sure how that happens unless they were prepared separately or the eggs were of different age. Coffee was good and constantly topped off. I am just not entirely sure that a single breakfast dish and coffee should run $20+ with tip.  Parking on the street is $1/hr by parking space number at the automatic meters.",

It was just myself so they probably thought I was the health inspector, food critic, or some shit like that. Lol.  Anyway, asked my server what was the best seller, she said the Truffle Egg Sandwich. 5 minutes later she came out with my food. THE FOOD WAS COLD! Every thing was not fresh to order. Wanted to say something, but I was too hungry to even bother. The sandwich was eh. Truffle oil wasn't over powering. Wish the bread was toasted more. And the feta added an additional flavor. Potatoes were bland. Not a lot of seasoning to them. The onions in them were burnt, and the strawberry on the side was an unnecessary garnish though.",

The food is amazing. The flavor is rich and the food came out super fast, despite how busy they were.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  I feel it's best to sum up this review with a quote my partner made over brunch, \"it's easy to find good food, but it's very hard to come across great food!\"",

It's a bit small inside the restuarant but so far, the waits haven't been too long each time I go. The staff weren't amazing, but they also weren't bad. They're kinda just doing their job.   The food is amazing though (only reason for the four stars). The pancakes are golden with yummy, yummy syrup. The deviled eggs are pretty good too; though; I wouldn't just order that. Again, the truffled egg sandwich is delicioussssssss. Truffle is just YUM. You must order this sandwich.",

Props to the interior designer because this place is totally my cup of tea. It's got that downtown, upscale hipster vibe that just makes you feel welcomed.   Now to the good part, the food. Our waitress recommended the biscuits to start. Ah-mazing! They come with a fruity syrup and fresh fruit. Seems like more of a breakfast or dessert item so maybe next time I'll save it for later. For an entree I chose the grilled cheese & tomato soup. No joke this was the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life! The portion size was huge so it lasted me for lunch & dinner. Enjoyed each and every minute of it! My coworker had the BLT which looked great too.  Can this place get any better? I'll definitely be back soon for brunch & more.",

Have seen the owner on several occasions talking down to staff and critiquing the manager in a hostile and rude way. Food was not all that impressive. While eating my wife and I heard the owner, I believe her name is Chef Natalie or something like that cussing at her manager. Actually called her a stupid ass just outside of the kitchen area. She was arguing with the manager that she was not a chef.   I'm done with this place. To top it off explosive diarrhea from food illness is never fun. Every time my wife and I eat here we get uncontrolled diarrhea that last for a couple of days. Think it is the slice they use or just a total lack of cleanliness. It's time for a better option in Downtown.",

The majority of our party was there aside from one friend with a baby. They wouldn't seat us until the entire party was there, which I normally understand though I think they should make an exception when babies are involved and all but one member of the party are there. I would not recommend this place for families.   They closed the patio as apparently it's not open during the week, which was disappointing. It was a beautiful day and that space would have been perfect for our party.  My sister and I split the breakfast burrito, which was delicious!, and the biscuits, which were not worth it.   The service was slow and the credit card machine was down, which didn't help, but I understand that definitely happens.   Overall, I wouldn't choose this place for brunch again.",

Although it was super busy, the food still tasted amazing.   -Truffle sandwich ($12): Super good, everything put together well. Potatoes are DELICIOUS.  -Shrimp&grits ($15): Loved this but wish it had more shrimp.  -Corn beef hash ($14): The corn beef is in cube-like form, and it was kinda hard. Still good, but wish the corn beef was softer.    SERVICE 2/5: We got sat down after 30ish mins. As we got seated our server came, jotted down what we ordered, but that was the last time I saw him. He never checked up on us AND WE HAD TO ASK 3 TIMES ABOUT REFILLING OUR WATERS to some other server.  -The server we asked about the refills obviously was getting super annoyed at us....like girl, we don't know where your coworker went AND we are eating savory dishes, we have to drink a lot of water to wash it down.  -Being a small restaurant, I expected that service would be pretty efficient...guess not.   The restaurant itself is small and cute. Reminds me of SoCal hipster brunch places. Definitely fits in the Downtown LV area. I would come back here for the food, just don't have high expectations about the service....   Tips to know beforehand: -There are meter parking spots, no free lot.  -Restaurant may be hard to spot, it's under an apartment complex.   -Wait can be about 30-40 mins.",

They give you maple syrup in a small glass jar which a cute touch. Was too cute to open it so we kept it as a souvenir. The pancake was so good on its on that we didn't miss the syrup. The coffee was good too and the bill was surprisingly reasonable for the amount and quality of food. Went here for the beignets originally but they didn't have them! Wahhhh! Otherwise great place!

    "text": "To start off, I had the Killer Grilled Cheese Sandwich (WITH BACON!!!) with Tomato Soup. I came on a trip to visit my friend who now lives in Vegas with a party of 7.  Food: the food was so awesome. My sandwich was loaded with bacon. It's not one of those places that charges you several bucks for bacon and only puts two strips. They LOADED the bacon. (Thank you, Eat. I love you for that) The soup was super fresh and very tasty. It was topped with aged cheddar that was pretty much the cherry on top.   The servers are very attentive and the cafe gives off such a good vibe. The decor is very hip and gives off an essence that Downtown Las Vegas is definitely trying to give off and own. I would come here again definitely.  Note: I wouldn't suggest coming in very large groups.",

Huevos montulenos (I'm close but not exactly right) a variation on Huevos Rancheros, filling with black beans and eggs over easy, ranchero and verde sauces side by side.  My dining partner completely ordered a la carte, fluffy egg whites, a lone pancake fluffy and thick dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied by a classy single serving of maple syrup in a small sealed bottle, and chicken apple sausage.  Want to go back, the entirety of the menu seemed appetizing.  Quick coffee service kept my cup full until I said stop. :)",

They were out of the corned beef hash so I got the pancakes instead with a chicken apple sausage. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast type of person ....rather savory instead. However, these pancakes were AMAZING! I hold pancakes at a high standard because of a place back home that's been around before my grandmother dined there (Liliha Bakery, Hawaii).  The three pancakes are thick and fluffy,  have a golden crust on the outside and a very soft, moistness on the inside. Big bonus: they serve them with real maple syrup.....not that imitation fake corn syrup stuff. I will be coming back for these again!",

    "text": "Truffled Egg Sandwich had straw mushrooms with the scrambled eggs, chives, Greek feta cheese, and sweet, smoked bacon - Extra thick slices - With chive potatoes home fried with the potato skin still attached on ciabatta bread rolls. The straw mushrooms were a delicious surprise that my taste buds didn't expect. From now on, if I try to cook with eggs at home the way I ate at EAT, I will use Asian sauteed straw mushrooms the way the chef did, because the taste was a brilliant dim sum likeness in flavor. The service was great, not only friendly, but helpful, because my son wanted a pancake, and the server helped him go through the menu to find the right pancake. Than to add to my boy's surprise, our server brought him his own individually sealed maple syrup jar, which thrilled him. Not just a bottle of maple set on the table like hot sauce or ketchup, each child gets a little individual glass jar of sealed maple syrup with their pancakes. Huevos Motulenos was eggs in a combined peppered green sauce Mexican chili. Motulenos breakfast dishes originated in the town of Motul in the Yucatan. Again more surprises, the spicy eggs had sauted bananas on corn tortilla. Perfect combination! Sweet fruit, bananas, but not too sweet, reminded me of dishes in Harlem, New York City with the addition of the bananas combined with peppers, eggs yolks, whites, and fresh stewed beans. There was a line of people outside when we arrived and leave the lobby. The place was packed. We heard stories of food networks and cooking channels coming to Las Vegas to visit the EAT restaurant Anthony Bourdain eats breakfast at when he visits Las Vegas. I guess he hosted a CNN TV special where he promoted EAT as the place to go in the Entertainment Capital of the World. People used to go to Hash House a Go Go, but now all the talk about the globe is the restaurant EAT if you visit Las Vegas. Afterwards, my family and I went to the most famous donut stand in town, which is directly across the street, Donut Bar. Their donuts are collecting awards all over the nation. All the kids had fun at the Downtown Container Park which is also directly across the street from EAT. Visit Kappa Toys with this kids. Extraordinary collection of specialty toys. This restaurant EAT is brightening up the whole neighborhood landscape with all the attention the chef is bringing to the corner with his fine cuisine.",

    "text": "The first thing you must know before eating here is not to come here on an empty stomach. I showed up on Sunday morning and waited between 30-45 minutes to get a table for two. The hosts were friendly and kept us up-to-date about the status of our table. Unfortunately, when we finally got our table, our server wasn't as helpful. He had zero sense of urgency and didn't do a good job of remembering our order. A second and a half after we ordered, another employee came back to double check our drink order, which was all wrong. Our food, which was good, was unceremoniously slammed down on the table moments later. I ordered the huevos motulenos and they were great, but not good enough to make up for the bad service. We kept having to ask for things like ketchup, even though there were potatoes on both of our plates. My friend had to ask for a coffee refill twice. These seem like basics the average IHOP waitress can do. Why can't downtown's \"hippest\" breakfast place do the same?  What ultimately convinced me not to go back was when the check was delivered. A little note from management was included telling patrons that Eat does NOT split checks because they're so \"busy.\" I just don't think that's good customer service, and I think it's a lie. They probably don't want to pay two credit card fees per check when they can pay one. Eat, this is Las Vegas. Excellent customer service is expected. Furthermore, who do you think you are, Joel Robuchon? Your food is not that good and the restaurant is not a place I would take out-of-town guests or even go back to. They don't serve alcohol, so you won't be able to wash down the bitter taste of bad customer service with a mimosa. Don't waste your time people. Brunch elsewhere.",

We got there just before the lunch crowd - 11:30 per my boss' recommendation - and watched people wait for tables at about 12:00 on . . .   The servers are very friendly and relaxed, they stopped and chatted for awhile as we had some questions about the food and later about the area (the same owner is opening another restaurant (bar type food) in the development across the street).  A little slow with the bill because they apparently only have one credit card machine and wouldn't you know, everyone wanted to pay at the same time with a credit card!   FOOD - the posole' is great - I love their posole'.  It tastes fresh and not too salty!  YUMMM!  We also ordered the ruben which was definitely one of the best I've ever had, but was huge!  Others at our table ordered the BLT which looked amazing and the egg truffle sandwich which was yummy for what it was, but isn't really my thing!!  We ended with the beignets and they are a deep fried donut.  So yes, naturally they are greasy, but that's what they are!!  It's like a pot roast that tastes like meat - well, of course it does!!  But they are fresh and just crisp enough with a two dipping sauces that you simply can't do without!!  I'm a fan!  Parking stinks, there is some curbside parallel parking for free across the street.  Pay curb parking on the side of the restaurant too.    We will be back - I love local eateries and this one was well worth the trip!!",

Aside from the food, the place had a positive atmosphere and the service was great. The only downfall to the service was towards the end when we were all ready to pay. We pulled out our cards and placed them on the table, only to have the owner walk up and say \"Can you pay with one card?\", abruptly leaving and then coming back with a receipt paper that had \"only one payment per table\" written on it and harshly walked away again without saying anything. I felt this was very unprofessional and rude especially coming from the owner. The payment rule, I feel, is such an inconvenience to the customer since everyone splits checks now a days. Putting up a sign or having the severs mention the payment rule would be great for the customers and restaurant to avoid any problems.  Overall the experience was good, the interior design was great, the customer service was iffy, but the food was delectable.",

    "text": "We finally tried eat this past weekend and I'm sorry to say that I don't think the experience matched my expectations.  We came for brunch, and the brunch menu is different from the breakfast menu online so the truffled egg sandwich I wanted to order wasn't actually on the menu. :( Instead, I had beignets, which were just ok. They were moist and doughy, not the light fluffy texture I associate with beignets. There was a box of Cafe du Monde beignet mix sitting on a shelf in the kitchen so I guess maybe they use that? But the texture was unlike the real thing and not even like the ones I've made with the same mix at home. They were served with a really tasty jam that greatly improved the flavor, though.  I also found the coffee to be a bit weak, which is normally not something I would not even bother to mention, but I think it's important for a breakfast/brunch spot to have great coffee.  My husband had a chicken-fried steak which I did not sample. I did try all of the accompaniments, though, and the potatoes, eggs and especially the toast were all pretty delicious. Maybe savory food is the way to go here!  Our waitress was pleasant if a bit scattered and we did get seated right away despite it being basically peak breakfast time. I am willing to give eat another shot- I hear that a dog-friendly patio is in the works so since we live, like, ridiculously close, we will be back, pug in tow, for weekday breakfast or maybe lunch when that opens up.",

    "text": "Oh, Eat--I really wanted to like you, especially after hearing such glowing recommendations from friends, but you just left too much to be desired.  As far as the good: the decor was really cute and reminded me of some farm-to-table eateries in Denver or Portland, and I really appreciated the variety of menu items, which included healthy options and vegetarian-friendly dishes.   The execution, however, desperately needed work. My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast on a weekday morning (meaning the place was busy but not slammed), and we ordered water and coffee upon our first interaction with the server. Neither came out until our food arrived. (And it should be noted that my breakfast didn't come out until my boyfriend was almost finished with his plate.)   As far as food quality, I was again disappointed. I love the idea of beignets, especially with jam and mascarpone, but they were pretty overcooked. My egg white frittata was so wet that I literally had a pool of water on my plate, which made my English muffins soggy and water-logged, and my boyfriend ordered the tofu scramble, which was flavorful but unbelievably greasy.   I love the concept of this restaurant, and I think a lot of people want Eat to succeed, since it provides a sense of authenticity to the burgeoning neighborhood, but the actual execution needs some refinement before I could recommend it to anyone.",

I had the cinnamon biscuits and he had the chilaquiles. Both meals were out of this world. Good home cooked food that was very satisfying. They say the best food in the world is on the Strip... I say there best food in Vegas are little hidden gems such as this one. If we ever come back we will eat here again.",

So hidden, in fact, you might drive right by and miss it. But that would be sad. Just sad.   Came in for lunch and it was pretty crowded, but our party of two was able to get seated right away. The atmosphere is casual and fun. Servers were all great as was the food. I had the DWBLT and it was to die for. And if you like ginger ale, order theirs. It's the best in the world. They shake the bottle up for you and pour it into your glass. James Bond style.  And there's real ginger in the bottom of that bottle! Just take a look!  You can sit at the counter or a table. And even get a way cool black t shirt if interested. I meant to but forgot on my way out.   And parking is pretty plentiful by meter all around the block.   Some places just find a way to get everything right. This is one of them. So please don't miss this opportunity if you're in town (or better yet, live there). You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "So when I told my bf that I wanted to go here he immediately started to complain about the parking meters.  I told him to suck it up and we headed down there.  I first ordered a bottle of water and the waitress told me that they don't have bottled water.  My bf grinned and said \"I think I'm going to like this place.\"  I was debating about what to order and then decided on the shrimp and grits.  I asked if I could have poached eggs instead of fried.  The waiter came back and said \"the chef said no to the poached eggs.\"  My bf then got a bigger grin on his face and said, \"I think I really like this place.\"  He claims to be tortured by myself and all my bougie girlfriends that are always trying to modify menu items - whatever.    Anyways the food arrived and was delish.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked which is a nice treat, since frequently, even at some of the best restaurants shrimp gets overcooked.  Everything is made in house and the fruit was excellent.  The fruit bowl consisted of berries and orange slices, not a mangy slice of tasteless cantaloupe or honey dew to be seen (blech).  The portions are regular sized, not grossly gagantuan and the food was beautifully presented.  The bill came to $38 for both of us.  Maybe a little high for an off-strip breakfast/lunch spot.  But when taking into account the technique used to prepare the food and the quality of the ingredients quite fair.        The service was relaxed but attentive.  The owner was walking through the restaurant and checked in on all the tables.  The vibe of the restaurant was more consistent with something that I would expect in Austin or Seattle, so a nice change from what you usually get in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Probably one of the cooler restaurants I've been to in a while. I just had breakfast there and I was so compelled to immediately write a review. Eat is located in an area of Downtown that is being redeveloped. I'd say that this place is probably the impetus of redevelopment in its immediate area - the area looks like it could be kinda sketchy at night. But it was fine when I went in the morning. In fact, they are only open until 3pm, so don't be scared and check them out!  Walking in to the restaurant, I really got a hip, trendy, downtown feeling - exactly what I'm looking for when visiting any downtown restaurant in any city. I was promptly greeted and seated. I sat at the counter, which overlooks the open-kitchen.   The staff working there seem to match the hip, downtown look the restaurant is going for - tattoos, t-shirts and funky hair. I must've stood out with my clean cut look, but hey there are a lot of businesses in the area so I'm sure the \"corporate\" folk come here too, especially for lunch.   I ordered the truffled egg sandwich, which, thanks to Yelp, seems to be one of the more popular items. My food came out quickly and I was a lot of food! The sandwich was in a perfectly toasted croissant and was topped with eggs, mushrooms and very crisp bacon. It came with a side of potatoes.   Overall a great breakfast to start my day and a place you should check out.",

    "text": "When I heard this place has beignets, I was completely sold. I have been craving beignets for so long, you'd think there would be more places that serve them! Anyway, I came here on a Friday morning and parking was not difficult to find. It was just street parking so bring quarters for the meter. The place wasn't too busy, there were plenty of open tables, but we still waited close to 10 min.   Food wise, we had to get the beignets to start. When they came, they were smaller than expected. They're also denser than I like, but still quite good. They reminded me of a sugar doughnut hole. The best part of them was the seasonal jam and vanilla scented mascarpone as the dipping sauces. I put so much of those on, it was like eating the dipping sauces with a side of beignet.   For the rest of the meal, the 2 others joining me had the Two Eggs any style with the smashed potatoes, while I tried the Chilaquiles. The Two Eggs any style was nothing to write home about. It was exactly as described, two eggs any style, a slice of bacon, bread, and some potatoes. The \"smashed potatoes\" were just cubed potatoes with some seasoning, which was a bit lacking. We all thought it was overpriced since nothing was particularly outstanding. My Chilaquiles was pretty tasty, it was essentially scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers over tortilla chips, a sort of breakfast nachos. But the chicken sausage that was sitting on top was a bit too sweet for the dish, it just stood out too much.   The staff was fairly friendly, however the one waitress that brought our check was not exactly rude, but she had some attitude when holding the check out for us. She didn't say anything, but from her body language, she looked annoyed at us for no reason.   Overall, this place was alright. It's a decent breakfast spot but I don't think there's much here to actually crave.",

    "text": "We took a cab from LVH to downtown Las Vegas to check out \"eat - the breakfast & lunch joint\". A few of our friends had checked it out the day before. It has a relaxed industrial vibe. I particularly like the light fixtures. But the overall feel of the place is cool without pretentiousness.  We had a chance to eat at the bar which looks into the kitchen. From this vantage you could see the chefs hard at work creating great food. On our visit Chef Natalie was sitting at a table doing admin work near the bar, but even though she worked on these paperwork duties, every dish still went out with her keeping a watchful eye on quality. She would occasionally banter back and forth with the chefs and comment about how they garnished the meal. The waitstaff was professional and friendly and checked on our needs throughout our meal without being obtrusive.  As for the food, I got the Huevos Motulenos - two eggs over easy with red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta and sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. And Rachel got the Mediterranean Egg White Frittata - Spinach, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, feta and micro-basil with whole wheat Toast. We were both very happy with our orders.  I liked the sweet and spiciness of my dish and I thought the peas added a great texture and flavor. I would definitely order it again. Rachel really liked how the spinach inside of the frittata was cooked so that it still had texture. The feta on top of the frittata was flavorful, and the olives had a good brininess but didn't over power the dish. She thought each bite had a good combination of flavor and it didn't need any extra seasoning. Our meal including fresh ground coffee was about $24 (not including tip). Considering the breakfasts and lunches we had at LVH, we thought the price was comparable if not cheaper and the food was a billion times better at eat. Even with the extra we paid for the cab ride, to us, it was worth the trip to get amazing food. Eat has only been open for about 7 months and I hope that they have continued success. We only get to Las Vegas about once a year and I really hope to get a chance to check out the rest of their menu. We would eat every breakfast and lunch here each time we come to Vegas.",

It was a weekday and the place was pretty busy with the lunchtime crowd but we were still able to get a table as soon as we got there. After sitting down and getting a quick introduction from our server my impressions of the place was immediately favorable. It was obviously a local joint and the atmosphere reflected that. There were quite a few regulars there as evident from their familiar interactions with the staff and with the friendly service I knew that if we were locals we would be regulars here too.  And of course the food was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp and grits and the corned beef hash. Both plates were amazing in that comfort food goodness kind of way. I loved the chunky corned beef and the way the grits were seasoned was just perfect! The toasts that both plates came along with was also good and you'd want an extra helping to sop up the creamy grits. Last but not least, the coffee was really good! I thought I'd be disappointed that they didn't have an espresso machine but we liked their coffee so much that we ended up buying a bag! Turns out they use beans from Mothership Roasters, a local roasting company that sources single origin beans. Yup, exactly my kind of place. We were definitely happy to have found this place!",

The place is memorable, I stumbled on it a year ago and couldn't wait to bring friends here during my current visit.  I would love to have given them five stars, but our waitress was more interested in seating new clients than dropping our check. We literally waited with empty glasses and plates while finally standing up and leaving for us to checkout.  I wouldn't let that discourage you from visiting. When in vegas, this is a must to visit and enjoy.  Shrimp and grits were a very cool change, but pancakes and fresh orange juice is awesome too!",

Inside the style is contemporary.  Ordered the huevos and fried steak dishes. Both were delicious. Their huevos dish has bananas in it and wasn't too spicy with both of the sauces. The steak was delicious and the fried breading and gravy made it even better. The sourdough toast was sick!  They have fresh squeezed oj here. It isn't squeezed on-site, but is fresh squeezed not from concentrate.  Service was pretty good for us but we came right before the rush. Servers stopped by within minutes of themselves and others to check in on us. We felt like we were celebrities. Gary, our server, was friendly and took care of us!  I'd come back again to try another of their interesting twists on a classic. There's street parking outside. Bathroom was clean.",

    "text": "One chilly Sunday AM that we happen to be on the Eastside of town, we dec'd that we wanted to have breakfast and try something new. My husband wanted to go to Ellis Island, always a safe choice and unfortunately, would've probably been better off going there.   So to start, it's downtown. Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around-- deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9:00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us.   SERVICE: We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok. Server finally made his way over to our table and he was a borderline D. We were greeted with a very bland \"Ready to order or do you need more time?\", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice.  SHRIMP & GRITS: Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp & Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits  muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment.   CHICKEN FRIED STEAK: Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it.  PASSION FRUIT ICED TEA: The best part of my meal. WTF.  AMBIANCE: Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal. Menu's presented on clipboards, urban chic decor, great idea and if we went by ambiance alone, then this place would be 5 stars! Too bad, so sad it's not.",

It's located in the downtown Las Vegas neighborhood on a corner right behind the festival, so it was easy walking distance for everything.  The pancakes!  Yes...These were the best pancakes I've ever ate.  The were Golden brown with a perfect crisp to the top.  Full of flavor and not dry at all and it was served with a chicken sausage. Now the Huevos Motulenos, another great choice.  The menu is not huge my any chance, but they definitely have some really good options.  Next time we will try some of those biscuits and fried deviled eggs that I saw everyone having.  Prices are very affordable.  Don't miss out...",

We got:  Tap water - FREE  1 coffee $3 - she kept asking if we wanted it refilled and even if we wanted a cup to go.  B. got a full size bowl of green chile chicken posole $9 - it's a huge bowl we shared.  Soup was tasty enough, chicken dry.  I got Arugula salad $10 - even at 9am you can get salad.  I wanted it for fiber since when we travel we don't eat enough greens.  It was tasty enough.  Our total with tax $23.78 but before tip.  Separate bathrooms available.",

It was so fast. We both ordered an entree. I got the Mexican dish with green and red chile. Delish! I've lived in Albuquerque so I'm picky about chile and his was perfect. Great spice. Great flavor! The pancake, by the way, was also SO good. Fluffy and had a nice crisp to it. My hubby ordered the chicken fried steak. New take on it-- had maybe some chipotle flavor. Excellent. Then the server heard us saying we just moved here and he gave us a list of his favorite spots around town. Overall--- IMPRESSED! Def going back for the grilled cheese. The bread looks incredible.",

We got our food and we sat for a bit realizing they forgot to bring us our utensils. I ordered the cinnamon biscuit with the strawberry compote. My husband felt like having their \"killer grilled cheese\" with some \"kick-ass tomato soup.\" My dish was decent but unremarkable except that I couldn't taste any cinnamon at all. I felt that I may have punted and should have ordered the chicken fried steak despite the waitress thinking the portions might be too large for me. I tried my husband's grilled cheese. Frankly, I make a far superior grilled cheese. The bread was too thick and it seemed more like a cheese sandwich with melted cheese. I could give this place another go since we might not have ordered the right items. But in my opinion, if a place is going to name their dish \"killer grilled cheese,\" they really need to back it up.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Eat after a recommendation from a co-worker. This was my first stop Saturday morning arriving in Las Vegas. We got there around 8:30, found parking on the side of the building (you only have to pay the meter Monday-Friday). The 4 of us were seated right away however, by the time we left there was a line (get there between 8-9am). The fried deviled eggs were a winner, the eggs benny was good, especially after I added hot sauce. I tasted the shrimp and grits and it also needed hot sauce. To be honest I expected a bit more flavor however it was good... I just wanted it to be as GREAT as the Yelp reviews made it seem. I was mostly impressed by the service. The managers are all over the floor making sure you're taken care of. It's a real team effort there! I would 100% go back but I'll be sure to bring some extra seasoning with me :)",

Located at the corner of Carson and 7th Streets, it faces a vacant lot which I believe is included in Zappos' Dowtown Project initiative.  The staff was very friendly though numbering more than seemed needed.   We requested a single order which turned out to be 5 small beignets served with strawberry jam and mascarpone cheese.  Owner/chef Natalie Young stopped by our table and cheerfully accommodated my request for a photo.  I feel menu prices are too high given the restaurant's location and the small portion size though the coffee and beignets had a high quality quotient.",

    "text": "I am in LOVE with this place for putting such a unique twist on breakfast and brunch! Grilled cheese on texas toast?! Where do you see that?! Almost nowhere!  We were staying near the strip, so going to Downtown Las Vegas was a nice change from the hustle and bustle. We got seated right away during peak breakfast time on a Wednesday morning. The menu was very organized into different sections, with a few options in each section. I have a belief that the smaller the menu, the better the food (usually) because they know what works and what doesn't, and there's less of a chance for you to order something that's just \"okay\". Anyway! I ordered the tofu scramble that came with chive potatoes, with a side of vegetable chili. My friends ordered the grilled cheese that came with tomato soup, and some egg dish (I forgot the name!).  My tofu scramble was very different from all the other tofu scrambles I've had in my time being vegan. I usually have it in little pieces so that it looks like..scrambled egg. Mine was in cubes. Very oily cubes. I wasn't a huge fan of the oil but the tofu wasn't too bad. The potatoes were very good. My chili was flavorful but too salty.  I accidentally had some tomato soup that had cheese in it (we had no idea), but that was one of the better tomato soups I've ever had. The grilled cheese was huge. For light eaters, I think that could've satisfied two people. The housemade chips were delicious as well (I think they had cheese in it, too?!). The egg dish was given a thumbs up from my friend.   All the servers are very efficient at what they do, but do not sacrifice customer service while doing so. Many other places should take pointers from here.  Overall, our meal was enjoyed and we left with our stomachs full and hearts happy! Come stop by if you're in Vegas to eat something a little different!",

Fluffy and light, but also with a nice crispy Golden Brown texture that is making me hungry for them even now.  We arrived at a strange time between Breakfast and Lunch so parking wasn't a problem. I can certainly see how it could be though considering it's mostly pay street parking, and it doesn't appear to be in the best part of Downtown Las Vegas.  I certainly hope to stop in at least one more time before we leave Vegas this time, and plan to make it a must-stop for future trips!",

We started with some of their fresh baked berry biscuits which were freaking unbelievable. We're talking hot, fresh baked biscuits topped with fresh fruit and jam. Simply amazing.   For our mains, I had the chicken breast sandwich with mozzarella and a side of bacon on a ciabatta bun while my wife had the eggs benedict. Both dishes were awesome.  The chicken sandwich was cooked perfectly, and the bacon, mozzarella, and greens complemented each other perfectly.  The sandwich is topped with an amazing pesto mayo and the entire things rests on a delicious, toasted ciabatta bun.  I had the freshly made potato chips as a side and they were fantastic.  There were tons of them too.   My wife's eggs benedict was easily one the best she's had, with perfectly cooked eggs and fabulous hollandaise sauce.  The dish came with delicious potatoes, which were perfectly prepared. I also have to comment on the coffee, which was outstanding.  Rich and delicious and perfectly brewed. Absolutely fabulous coffee.   Service was friendly and impeccable.  We were greeted promptly by the chef/owner who offered us a pick of the available tables (we popped in an hour from closing and the place was nearly packed).  Orders for drinks and biscuits and then our food were promptly taken and served, with the food coming out just as we finished off those amazing biscuits.    This was a great find - we had amazing food and an outstanding time.  We already can't wait to return!",

    "text": "I am utterly disappointed with my brunch experience at eat. Let's start with the food...  I ordered the eggs Benedict, which seems like a weekend special only (It wasn't on the menu). It was ok--I think the presentation was better than the actual food. There was a little too much hollandaise sauce and it tasted like any other eggs benedict; not a \"special\" if you ask me! The potatoes were good--it was due to the seasoning though...just the right amount of salt!  My friends got the corn hash, tomato soup and truffled egg sandwich. While the pictures all depict a salivating taste in your mouth, collectively, we thought otherwise. It was okay....I guess we were expecting more since the reviews had high ratings. But then again, we are from southern ca--the land of innovation and delicious food.   Let's just move on to the part that caused me to give this establishment a 2 star rating: Customer Service. Coming into the restaurant, we had a 20 minute wait, which was reasonable for a Sunday. Upon sitting, they took our drink orders and brought it out fairly quickly. Our server took a while to finally take our orders and from there it went downhill. My friend got the soup and it came out first. Thus, we can assume our order was put in (since one person in our party got their meal). But nope! For some reason, the rest of the orders were \"cut off\" and the kitchen didn't receive it. After 30 minutes, our server still hasn't checked up on us (not even to refill our coffee and waters!) and I had to ask another server for our order. You could imagine how annoyed we were seeing tables paying for their meals...even though they were sat after us! Yep...pretty sucky! With 2 apologies and no compensations for the lack of error on their part, I would not come back to this, nor recommend it to others. There are better brunch places out there that are worth trying and I'd rather give those establishments my time for their service. Eat definitely failed me and my friends. While some people won't take my review into consideration, I hope someone from eat will look more into this to ensure it doesn't happen again.",

I also got the Truffled Egg sandwich (I like eggs ok?) which comes with yummy chive potatoes on the side. I did notice that the menu politely declines changes or substitutions, but I am a vegetarian so asked for everything with out bacon (sigh....) and they didn't seem bothered or phased at all.

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me with a visit to Eat today. I though the atmosphere was really cute and chic. The service was prompt and friendly. Everyone dining there seemed to be in good spirits. I was a little disappointed in the fact that breakfast was over. Ok, I understand that it was already 1pm but breakfast all day should be the way to go.  I was torn between the salad selection and the free range chicken sandwich.  My Boyfriend ordered the BLT. When the food arrived we each shared a half. The BLT was the far better sandwich, although I thought the bread was a little over buttered. The free range ciabatta was bland tasting in comparison, not to mention the soggy ciabatta. Which really disappointed me because I was longing for that crisp addicting crunch factor.  I will be back to try the breakfast.",

I came in with my parents and they enjoyed their meals: oatmeal and an egg dish. I had the tofu scramble and although it wasn't the best, it wasn't bad. They do need to kick that up a notch and add more vegan friendly dishes on the menu (I had to ask for the tofu scramble because it wasn't on the menu when I arrived yet it was on the menu online). The menu said it came sauteed with onions, peppers and mushrooms and I assumed it would be firm tofu scrambled but it was fried squares with little flavor and no onions or peppers (I told them to hold the mushrooms). The potatoes were delicious and so was the very thick cut toast! Yum! I will definitely be back next trip to Vegas but hope to see more vegan items on the menu.",

They didn't charge for soda water, which I always order and hate being charged for. Loved this place and we went to container park when we were don't.

There was no wait and we were seated immediately even though we didn't have our whole party (they were like 1 min away).  The decor of the place stands out! I loved it. You can totally do a photo-op here. We were seated by a cute wall and people kept approaching our table to take pictures of it.   Food was great (a bit pricey, but that's brunch for ya). I tried the truffle egg bacon sandwich, the biscuits, and the deviled eggs. The sandwich was really good! I wouldn't eat that every day though since the flavors are so powerful. The potatoes, unfortunately, were a disappointment. I needed so much ketchup since the potatoes were so bland. The biscuits were good but they reminded me of those strawberry shortcake. The deviled eggs were different than what I'm used to... that fried panko crusted egg gave some texture to the usually smooth taste. Flavors were there and I would definitely eat it again.  Overall, the staff were attentive in getting us water despite the busy crowd. Note: they do not serve alcohol.  For those who are waiting, there is a cute (and kinda large) wait area.",

Well, thanks to Yelp, boy did I find THE FIND.  What an awesome place! First of all, we found metered parking on the street easily. As we walked the block closer, we could smell the B-A-C-O-N. No joke! The aroma wafted to our nostrils and led us right to Eat.   What a cook vibe this place has. Think industrial hipster. It's casual, good for groups, and kids. My friend, her 5-year old son, and I were seated right away. Since I did my homework and read up on the menu and everyone's recommendations, I had an idea what I wanted to order. The menu is just one page, so you're not inundated with too many confusing choices.   I told our waiter I was a wimp when it comes to spiciness, so he recommended getting the siraccha sauce on the side for La'Kat's Deviled Eggs. Those deep fried babies topped with bacon were awesome! My friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs, her son got scrambled eggs and thick cut applewood smoked bacon. I tried the Truffled Egg Sandwich, which had scrambled eggs, bacon, wild mushrooms, feta, and green onions on a ciabatta served with potatoes. It was a little dry, but super tasty.   The next time I go to Vegas, I will definitely try to swing by Eat. If you live in Vegas or go downtown, you have no excuse. Go!",

It was savory and delicious. Served on a bed of generously seasoned potatoes and side of eggs.   Cinnamon biscuits - The biscuits themselves had a nice texture. It was drenched with a tasty, well balanced strawberry compote, topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar.   Deviled eggs - The eggs were cooked perfectly. The filling was light and creamy. It had a light crispy batter to add a  balanced texture. And the crispy bacon topping was the icing on the cake.",

Asked if we can sit at the bar and was told no.  Since we walked there and was a little thirsty and i asked for some water while we waited.  The  hostess was like not sure if I can. I guessed she got approval.  to give us some water. We waited for about 15 minutes and finally got a table, the place isn't that big.  If you have a big party wish ya luck. A lot of 2 tops and 4 tops.  The wife ordered pancakes and wow they were a good size.  I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with scrambled eggs soft.  Egg came out over cooked and so was the chicken fried steak.  Services was good but I wasn't really impressed with the food.",

We had to wait about 30min, but once we got to eating, we didn't care one bit.  I had the shrimp and grits dish that was divine. The shrimp were plump and plentiful and the grits were cooked just right. It got a little soupy towards the end, so I borrowed some toast.  My Father had Chilaquiles and he may have licked the bowl. He's usually an egg and turkey bacon guy, so this was a step out for him and he really enjoyed it. My guy had the corned beef hash...another winner.  Service was impeccable, deviled eggs are a must. We will be back.",

It is about 20 minutes from the Strip, but as we had a rental car, it was easy to get to and situated right in downtown Vegas. If you don't have a rental car, you can easily catch an Uber to get here. My boyfriend and I came here midweek for breakfast, and had no wait to be seated. We both ordered the 2 egg any style. This dish is served with smoked bacon, chive potatoes, and your choice of toast. My bacon came out exactly to my liking, and to my surprise, they had some of the most amazing fresh rye bread. I also really enjoyed their Mothership Roastworks fresh brewed coffee. Eat will definitely be on our list of places to revisit when we are back in Vegas.",

After searching the area, we found a few places. They all looked pretty good.. BUT, the Deviled Eggs caught our attention! So we decided on EAT.   If a little off the main DT Vegas strip, but fairly easy to locate with the gps.  The wait was very minimal. Staff was very friendly. And the food was GREAT!  Let me tell you...the Deviled Eggs did not disappoint! I almost didn't want to share with my other half.  Since then, its been our go to breakfast spot when we're in town!",

In fact it was so fast we were a bit confused and wondering what kind of vudoo are they doing in that kitchen.  LOL.  But no worries, everything was hot and well prepared.  I was there with 3 other people and none of us had any complaints.  The food was that good.  This is definitely on the list of places to get grub when in Vegas",

We came on a Sunday, their menu was very very basic like 5 items for breakfast... they said regular menu has only 2 more items. So basically you get pancakes, fried chicken steak, 2 eggs any style, eggs Benedict, or a sandwich.   At first the breakfast menu seemed weird three other tables around us thought the same thing and we were all flipping for more menu pages. When we got our food it was the perfect amount. The coffee was amazing. It's more of a youngster hipster place.. again there are only about 5 items on menu .. I ordered eggs to go with my pancakes... the pancakes were good alone. Customer service was amazing! Everyone asked how we were doing it's almost like there was no specific table assignments.",

It seems like it's just a typical breakfast sandwich, yet it's anything but.  The eggs were fluffy, the truffles gave the eggs great flavor, the bacon was also flavorful and crispy, and the bread was soft. It seems like that would be average, but it is rare that all elements of a breakfast sandwich are made well.   The only thing I didn't like about my meal was the side of potatoes...they were pretty dry, though well seasoned.  I try to experience new places each time I visit Las Vegas, but if I am in the mood for something I know will be good, I'll definitely return here.",

    "text": "According to yelp I checked in here 27 days ago and that's how long it has taken me to almost stop being disappointed. We waited about 35 minutes, no big deal. We were sat at a shared table when lower tables were open but I assumed a 4-top needed it but for at least 30 minutes nobody was seated at either of the open tables, no bid deal. Then the server came over and it went downhill from there. No greeting, straight to \"have you decided on drinks\" okay she's busy, no big deal. She returned and asked \"are you ready to order\" okay she's still busy, no big deal. The food came, we took ONE bite and she dropped the check and said \"no rush.\" Unacceptable. We are locals that did a stay cation for Valentine's day weekend (no kids, adults only, special weekend) and this is the worst service we received in 4 days. The soup and grilled cheese was good, deviled eggs were good and my mans sandwich was good but nothing was great and the service was horrible. I take it back, the young lady playing the guitar was GREAT! She played No Scrubs by TLC on a guitar and killed it, she made my meal. If you get someone who says more than a few things, this experience probably isn't bad. Good luck.",

It's a small cozy spot near a few blocks walk from the Freemont Experience.  I went around 9am on a Friday, and luckily I was able to be seated right away.  There's tons of street parking available for a fee and a convenient loading spot right in front.  It's a little dark inside, but I like the vibe.  Ended up trying a little bit of everything.  I liked the strawberry biscuits better than the pancakes.  Not that the pancakes weren't good, they were just on the heavier side and I prefer fluffy.  The pancakes were a little crispy which is a plus.  I tried the corned beef hash and the eggs benedict, all winners.  I ended up on the tomato soup and grilled cheese.  That might've been the best I've ever had.  It just reminds you of home.  What must've been a pound of cheese was melted between crispy texas toast served with a bowl of creamy tomato soup. Sooo good.  As you leave the restaurant the door says \"ate.\"  Love it!",

This place made me feel like I was in my father's kitchen as a child because I haven't tasted potatoes like that since I was little. Bravo.

Grits were not over bearing and  all flavors complimented each other for a tasty treat. The Egg Truffle Sandwich was phenomenal. This sandwich was mouth watering from the first bite!  It's extremely tasty - very favorable. The combination of flavors sing a melody in your mouth.  This is a must get if you visit this restaurant. It's locally owned and a neat place place for brunch. The only downside (that has nothing to do with the food) is a bit noisy. A special shout out to Darnell - who was attentive to clear our table. A nice addition to the dining experience.",

We ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich & Kick Ass Tomato Soup to share and they did not disappoint!  Portions are good sizes; we took 1/3 of the sandwich and about half the soup home for later :)   The cibatta bread for the sandwich was so soft and wonderful.  The soup was hearty and great left over. The wait staff was attentive, refilling our waters and bringing the check without us even asking!   We will definitely be back to try more of their other offerings!! Thanks EAT for such a great experience!!",

Chef Natalie Young has helped re-ignite the downtown area by giving people a hip trendy spot to start their day. As you step inside, it makes you feel like you're not in the desert, but somewhere in the Bay Area or even NYC. Serving breakfast and lunch, The menu items at Eat definitely has something for everyone. We decided on the Huevos Montulenos and the Downtown Benedict (Served on the weekends only)  Our server was very attentive and offered suggestions as well as answered any  questions we had before making our decision, and kept our coffee mugs full with the tasty coffee from the Colorado River Roasting Company-YUM!  The Huevos Montulenos is layered with tons of flavor-a tortilla with sweet peas, black beans, saltiness from feta cheese, more added sweetness from bananas(not sweet plantains) covered with two fried eggs and topped with a nice heat from the christmas sauce(AKA salsa rojo y salsa verde) served with a mound of potatoes. The benedict was kinda small in portion size but definitely made up in flavor with the wheat english muffin, turkey bacon sauteed spinach and two perfectly poached eggs that oozes out as you cut into it. Being in the food biz, I can tell whether a place cuts corners, but the hollandaise sauce is the real deal Hollyfield folks...it is dangerously good!  If you happen to be in the area, stop by for a tasty bite. You will not be disappointed! Looking forward to returning to try Chef Natalie's other creations...ALOHA!!!",

If I'm going to have eggs Apple smoked bacon and  delicious thick toast EAT is a much better choice than Denny's or IHOP. I love the free range chicken sandwich and the Caesar chicken salad. the deep fried panko crusted deviled eggs with Apple smoked bacon and a touch of sriracha are to die for. it's an orgy in your mouth with a happy ending and well worth the money. Corned beef hash and eggs it's delicious, pancakes delicious, truffle egg sandwich delicious even the grilled cheese with basil tomato soup is delicious . So far everything I have eaten there has been delicious.   Natalie the chef and owner has brought a great burst of sunshine to the downtown area with her fresh twists on traditional American breakfast and lunch. I hear she's going to open a fried chicken spot can't wait to taste that.  If you're going to go try to go early it gets kinda busy around lunch time. A nice touch is they have some counter seating for single person or a cool community table if you like conversation. weekends are really busy so I usually go on the weekdays. The staff is pretty awesome and all very friendly. The line chef runs a very well oiled machine of a kitchen.   I never really have too much trouble finding a parking spot there's a lot of meters in the area. If you're in the downtown area I recommend making EAT a ATE.",

Our server informed us he could not split the checks and we would have to split the checks ourselves. There was no gratuity.   Had the chicken steak with gravy sauce and replaced my eggs with bacon. Also had a stack of pancakes.   The chicken steak tasted a bit plain. So I ended up pouring a lot of syrup on almost everything. Lol their syrup containers are among the cutest I've ever seen. Lol   All in all , I had some expectations for this place with the reviews. It was just okay.",

This place is located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, adjacent to container park which is by the way a pretty neat park/shopping/dining area.    The ambience inside the place was perfect. It's more of a like hipster/breakfast vibe w/ wooden decors and stainless chairs.    One of my old time favorite breakfast is country fried steak and I was a little iffy getting it here but I had to try it.....and let me tell you, it met my expectations! Eggs was perfectly cooked right and steak was perfect, not rubbery or oily like other breakfast joints. And the potatoes that came with it  was pretty good as well. The only thing that really surprised me was the toast, it's not like a thin bread that they just took out of the package, but a thicker bread slathered perfectly with butter and the bread is fantastic!   Also had the golden brown pancakes which is WOW! It's 3 pieces of buttermilk w/ chicken apple sausage on top!! Very creative and the pancake just melts in your mouth w/ there honey syrup which is finely made at the restaurant!   Drinks we had apple organic juice...and let me tell you for me being a big foodie and not really a health freak....this made not want to drink just a regular \"Apple juice\".    Overall, great ambience, great location, great staff. Try to come early as it gets packed fast.  Will definitely bring family and friends here.  Worth the drive!",

When they are with us, we always make sure our friends come with us so that they may partake in the awesomeness of this joint as well.  Eat. was discovered by a dear foodie friend of ours a couple years back, and ever since, we all make sure to go there at least once. Their coffee is awesome, their golden pancakes are oh-so-fluffy and ever so sweet, and their biscuits with the strawberry/berry sauce are OMFG AMAZING. Like seriously, I don't know how to better desribe them other than by using hip, youngster acronyms. We always get a plate or two to share with our group before eating the rest of their menu.   I almost failed to mention their adorable (and, of course, delicious) mini-syrups that come in little jars. I always try to get at least 2 to go just so I can keep them at home and never open them--they're too perfect and cute.   Service has always been wonderful--we have never had a bad experience. All the waiters, waitresses, hosts, and hostesses are always so nice and professional. We have had Gary two times in a row the last year, and he is very funny and sweet, and also very attentive.   To sum all of this up: you should eat at Eat. It's not even an \"if\"-- it's a \"no question at all, you should\". I'm glad this place exists.",

What we didn't like was the slow, unfriendly service: We came about 10 am on a Sunday morning and were quoted 25 minutes for a table of 3. We waited 45 mins later after questioning why groups were being sat before us the hostess said \"oh I didn't know you were willing to sit at the high top table.\" Well, you didn't ask and I'm starving now!  When sat...we waited for someone to greet us...5 minutes beverage busser got our drinks...10 mins after our server Robert shows up asking if we were ready to order and realized we still didn't have a menu. Didn't feel welcomed. Bummer wanted to love this place   The good: the food was very delicious and we all got the same 2 eggs any style, chive potatoes, bacon ($11) they use high quality no hormones/organic etc food and the taste is great.   Maybe consider takeout? Never tried it for breakfast but the service is so bad and the food is so good it may be worth it.",

    "text": "I'm two years late to the party, but I finally ate at Eat. A few weeks ago, my husband was downtown on business and called me up asking for a recommendation for lunch. I told him to try Eat. Afterward, he told me about the awesome blta w/ egg sandwich he had. He took me to check it out the day of the Santa Run, but the santas kept us from getting to Carson and 7th so I'd have to wait to try Eat. Then, last week; success!   If driving be prepared to feed the parking meter. The restaurant sits on the lower level of Park Avenue Apartments. This tired building is sure to experience a revitalization thanks to the Downtown Project. Carson Ave has become a hot spot for downtown dining and it began with Natalie Young's Eat. She was the first to partner with Tony Hsieh and see her dream to fruition. She is currently working on her next venture, Chow.   Eat bustled on a late Saturday morning, while there was no line out the door. There was a wait for a table, but counter seating was available. We settled in and gazed over the menu. Our server asked, \"Can I get cinnamon biscuits started for you?\" Many might be duped by the question thinking they are complimentary, only to be surprised later by an $8 charge on the bill. It is a bit sneaky so be warned. Yet, we said, \"yes, bring them on!\" The tender biscuits swim in strawberry compote and are topped with berries. It reminds me very much of strawberry shortcake, add some fresh whipped cream and it'd be the perfect dessert.   When it came to ordering we skipped right over the breakfast items and went straight for the sandwiches. I had to try the dwblta ($11) myself and the husband went for the killer grilled cheese with tomato soup ($9). During the week more sandwiches are available, they all sound fantastic. However, if I ever get a chance to dine on a weekday, the chilaquiles will be mine!   I added cheese to my dwblta, I skipped the egg; I don't dig runny eggs, blasphemy, I know. This sandwich was great! All components married beautifully and the sourdough bread held it together without being too bready. It was a thing of beauty, truly. Sandwiches come with a side of house chips, potato or tomato salad. I really enjoyed the tomato salad. Despite my best efforts I could only devour half of the sandwich. I took the rest home. This sandwich could easily be shared.   He added tomato, egg, and avocado to the killer grilled cheese. It was a tasty twist, especially when dipped in the soup. However, as good as it was we agreed we enjoyed the dwblta a bit more. In fact, it might just be the best damn sandwich in lv.",

Only downside is that the location is in downtown and the parking can be a bit difficult if you come by on a busy day.   Me and my friends all ordered the Eggs Benedict which was delicious! I usually order Eggs Benedict at any brunch places and eat's benedict by far has to be one of my favorites. We shared an order of the cinnamon biscuits which I really enjoyed and wouldn't mind ordering that next time if I was craving something sweet for brunch.   I'm happy that I finally got to try one of the most popular brunch places here in Vegas and will be coming back soon for another brunch date!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but too many things led up to this being a 2 star review based on my experience. We have tried several times to eat here but they were either closed or I just was pressed for time and couldn't wait as they're always packed.   We arrived at around noon and it was stated it would be 25 minute wait. I waited outside patiently with my guy and we were seated about 20 minutes later. We sat down and my guy went back to the car to make sure we paid the parking meter. I waited about  10 minutes to even be acknowledged by anyone. The wait staff and kitchen staff were very busy and everyone running around this fairly average sized place. After a gentlemen took our drink order I waited patiently for my guy to come back. I thought he brought sanitizer back as I didn't bring anything in with me besides my phone. So I got up to head to the restroom so I could wash my hands. As packed as this restraunt gets I had to wait for the restroom. The lady who exited explained they ran out of paper towels and let a wait staff member know , but she just continued to fill drinks and then completely disappeared. So i made serveral attempts at making eye contact in hopes of being able to flag down someone to refill them. While staff members just gave me blank stares and ignored me. Finally a waitress with her hands full informed me they were in a cabinet inside the bathroom and tried to open it with her shoe while her hands were full of dirty plates and ketchup and hot sauce bottles mind you she's all the way inside the bathroom. Finally another girl came to put them in, informed me they didn't carry toilet seat liners when I asked about them. It was brought to my attention after my guy had used the restroom told me the girl who I had asked about liners was talking about me to other employees saying I was lucky they had toilet paper.   This is not the type of service I hope to recieve in a McDonald's. After an almost 30 minute wait and the rude customer service I was hoping the food would be okay. Which it was decent. I won't lie about that.   Shortly after we received our food but I was just so upset I didn't enjoy my meal. My guy had the shrimp and grits and since I'm not a fan of shrimp I didn't even bother to try. My corned beef was a bit on the small side but I did enjoy the sourdough toast it came with. Very buttery and crispy. Yum ! The pancake was a standard pancake nothing special.  Usually after a first time disaster I would give them another try but I definitely will not be returning to Eat.",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended by local foodie friends.  Cute place.  Service was great, portions were more than generous, food did not come close to meeting expectations. 1) Golden Brown Pancakes and chicken sausage - cakes were definitely golden brown.  They were moist but VERY dense, resembling a True cake like texture... imagine eating a 6 inch cake stacked 4 inches high!  Plate was served with one chicken sausage which seemed to be more of a garnish in comparison to the large portion of cakes.  Ended up ordering a side of bacon which was thick and tasty.  The bacon side was generous (5 slices)!!! 2) Huevos Motulenos - Very interesting combo of flavors especially with the bananas in such a savory dish.  Did we regret ordering, no.  Would we order again, no. 3) Green chicken chili posole - awesome flavor, pleasant amount of lime notes, it was served a little above room temp.  Not hot, just warm. 4) grilled cheese and chips - 7 year old was pleased but only able to eat 1/4 of the sandwich (would've been great if they had a Childrens menu or smaller portions available).  Chips were homemade and DELISH.  5) veggie burger and kick ass tomato soup - veggie patty lacked flavor and consistency was unpalatable, almost slimy.  I enjoyed gutting the burger, eating the alfalfa, tomatoes and Avos as a small salad on its own.  As a veggie foodie, I would not recommend.  Tomato soup did not kick my ass.  Flavor was okay, but the generously thick Parm shavings were unable to melt due to the again, tepid temp of the soup and possibly that the shavings were too chunky.  Still had a mild acidic tomato flavor (which I love)... just \"cold\".  The bread is thick and well grilled... if you love bread, they've got a lot.  If you don't, maybe explore the anti-which options.  Coffee stayed hot and filled to the brim. Again, service was great... although no one noticed that my entire veggie patty and bread sat on my plate as a deconstructed mess.  I was never afforded the opportunity to voice my dissatisfaction, would I have complained and sent it back? No but I would have definitely given my opinion.  I think it's a nice addition when servers ask about your experience and quality of food.  Otherwise you rely on yelp for constructive criticism/opinions.  Cute place, although off the beaten path.  Solid base, but room for improvement.",

Everything was piled into a bowl which left it like I was eating soup cuz there was so much liquid in the bowl. The bacon was at the bottom and gross cuz it was so soggy. I ate the shrimp and some grits and left everything else. My hubby got the chicken fried steak. This had good flavor and the batter on the steak was good but we couldn't even cut through it, it was so dry and chewy.... Spent $40 on this and won't be returning. The two stars is because it was a nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "Yay for an update with an added star! If you read my initial 3 star review, I said I will return in hopes that the breakfast is above average. Well it was, and again the owner/chef was very much involved.  I sat solo at the breakfast bar. I enjoy this because the kitchen is in clear view and you can see everything that's going on. Including communication and hustle of the staff. The girl who cooked my food even came over after to make sure I enjoyed, and suggested something for next time. I LOVE THE INVOLVEMENT!! From everyone!!  But anyway on to the food!  First off, the don't have beignets anymore, boo :( They were fresh and perfect and the mascarpone cheese (that is also a goner) went perfect with the bread and raspberry preserves. Instead they do offer a raison cinnamon bread. I passed because I had my heart set on something else.  By suggestion of the waitress I went with the ever so popular Huevos  Motulenos. It is a mix of fried eggs, green and red chili, bananas, black beans, peas, and feta served on top of a corn tortilla. I loved this dish. The chili alone was wonderful and had just the perfect amount of spice and flavor. It also blended real well with the other ingredients. I wasn't a huge fan of the banana, but I do not really eat bananas anyway, so no shocker there. I could see how it accompanies the dish for those who do enjoy them. I was told next time try to truffle eggs, which I intend to do.  Also, the orange juice was great. Some may not make a big deal about that, but a big glass of fresh OJ with a filling breakfast hits the spot!  It is great to see the success of this place downtown, and I will continue to be a customer and a fan!",

This time I tried the deviled eggs with just a side of the chicken sausage and a bowl of grits for breakfast with a large glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The deviled eggs were a warm creamy and spicy which gave me a bit of a shock but a thrill  I ate every last one looking  the sauce off my fingers.  I will definitely be dreaming about this one! The service was great the food was even better just like I always remembered. This breakfast was taken place on a Tuesday at 10 o'clock and the restaurant was full with buzzing locals. This will always be one of my favorite breakfast spots everything that I have tried here is very good so please, eat up!",

    "text": "I was excited to eat here because of all the Yelp raves about it. It's about 10 minutes from the strip and parking was easy (meter parking). Also the name of the restaurant is in a cool stylized font with the whole period thing at the end of the word eat--just makes you want to eat, right?  I went with the Huevos Motulenos which I honestly didn't like--I'm not sure why so many people are nuts over this dish. I feel like the salsa just doesn't go well in a main course. It was an interesting concoction of food items I've never really had together but I wish I had gotten something else. I wanted to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich but they only serve it Monday through Friday. Their pancakes are huge.  I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't because were somewhat duped into buying an appetizer. So, you know how lots of restaurants give you free bread before your meal? Our waitress asked us, after serving us water, \"would you like some biscuits?\" Well, to us this sounded like pre-meal free bread so we said yes. What she really meant to say is, \"would you like to start with an appetizer called the 'cinnamon biscuits, warm strawberry compote'?\" The money wasn't the issue, but the trickery into ordering more on the menu. She might as well have started by saying, \"would you like to start with the Dom Perignon?\"  The staff was very nice/efficient. I recommend checking this joint out if you want some breakfast off the strip. Is it worth taking a taxi here? No. I really only went because I had my car. Albeit, this is a decent breakfast eatery.",

    "text": "Now I've had this place bookmarked for nearly a year so I had very high expectations for this place. One of my Besties and her husband were in town and wanted to meet for breakfast. Since they haven't been in the newly renovated DT I figured that this would be the perfect place to have breakfast at. FYI We parked at El Cortez and walked over, which the restaurant is located right behind/after The Container Park heading south on 7th.   It was about 930am and the place was relatively full so we waited about 2-5 minutes to be seated. Customer service on this end was good as the hostess greeted us immediately upon entry and as she stepped away to clear up a (or perhaps even our) table one of the waiters walking by asked us if we have been helped. I like that. The place is a lot bigger than I was anticipating it to be however it's very DT. I can understand how this place can get packed especially if there are larger parties.   Anyway we got our seats and overlooked the clipboarded menu. Our drink orders were obtained off the bat however it did take a while to get our food order. Which our waiter politely apologized for the wait. The food did take a while too but I didn't mind as it gave me the opportunity to catch up with The Newlyweds however my tummy wasn't too thrilled about that as it couldn't stop growling.   For my drink I opted for the EARL GREY SUPREME tea ($4). It's basically just a tea bag of earl grey with a side of honey, which I dumped the whole lot into my cup. Refills of hot water are allowed....as with the coffee which my girlfriend ordered.   For food I ordered the EGG TRUFFLED SANDWICH ($12). It was superb. I knew I was getting into something tasty and delicious as I could smell the aroma of my chived potatoes waiting to be devoured. I didn't need to add any hot sauce(s), which are available upon request. There were perfect amounts of scrambled egg, bacon, and  mushrooms in between slices of the warm cibatta bread.   My buddies both got the pancake stakes($9)--so typical of Newlyweds, order the same exact thing. The stack was three full/large pancakes and had a sliced chicken sausage atop it with a strawberry and powered sugar to garnish. I'm not much of a pancake girl--maybe with my makeup time to time when I'm rushing--so my review on them will be bias. It was okay. They are very popular here so feel free to order them. Both of them liked their pancakes.  [Note: we really wanted to order the beignets to share however the waiter said that they are discontinued. I know I heard discontinued. Which is a real bummer as they seemed very, very popular so I'm hoping the waiter was just misinformed or meant to say that they were not being served the morning we went. That was a real bummer. Hence the knock of a star for the rating.]  All in all I'm pretty positive that I will be back again. And I'm already thinking I'll be back with the other (Yelp/Xtian) Bestie as she's jelly that I ate here. Awaiting that CES check first!!!   It's really a 3.75 star rating if we had decimals to rate with. Would I recommend it-yes. Would I come back-probably. Would I reorder what I ate & drank-definitely the sandwich, however I'd opt out of getting tea again as I can't justify the pricing for it. Maybe I'll just get another drink. There are other options on the menu that I would like to try and maybe I could give an updated review then!   Happy eats!",

It was my first time here and I came with two friends. I was expecting a rush at 830am but we were seated right away and they even had a little awkward table for a group of three. I thought that was really cute.   The service was great. Drinks and food came out quickly. The waitress made sure we were satisfied with our food but didn't come around often enough to make it annoying. They had a smile on their faces and made me feel like they genuinely wanted us to enjoy our time.  The owner was sitting out in the diner overlooking the operation of the restaurant and even pointing the staff to make sure things were getting done. I add this to point out the hard work and diligence that goes on at 'eat.'  We started off with the strawberry compote and it was amazing. It disappeared in all of five minutes. (Split this with a couple people before your meal. You will not regret it.) The berries were so fresh and so were the biscuits.  The orange juice is fresh and a bit pricey. I had the Downtown Benedict. The poached eggs were perfect. I loved everything about this place and plan on taking others with me. It is a little pricey. But you will come out of there very satisfied.",

The shrimp and grits at Brenda's was more creamy whereas this version is a bit watered down but still very flavorful. There was shrimp, bacon, grits and salsa which some how made the perfect combination of flavors. It wasn't too heavy but really tasty.   I also got to try the biscuits with strawberry compote which was a flop to me. The biscuits were not warm or flaky and felt like eating dry bread with strawberry compote. I don' t really care for biscuits unless I'm eating them with fried chicken so maybe I'm biased but I'd rather have a pancake, waffle or crepe.",

An unexpected surprise that is unique for the downtown area.    I almost always go for their short stack of buttermilk pancakes served with your own little jar of real maple syrup. Fluffy, creamy, sweet, homey goodness. Some of the best I've had. Hopefully more variation and play with the recipe in the future.   Truffled egg sandwich is amazing. Soft fresh bread, sub style with the most decadent but lightest scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms etc. A must try. Also comes with seasoned home fries.   Tomato salad is refreshing and light. Might just change your mind about the flavor tomatoes can posses.   Other items to check out-Corned beef hash, biscuits with fresh strawberry compote/ fresh fruit.  My only con would be that some menu items aren't available from time to time, maybe due to acquiring fresh product? (Paper & clipboard menu) I've also tried some other items that often miss the mark on just flavor.    Service from the lady's is great. Always on point and genuinely attentive. Nice, knowledgeable, caring.   Parking may be a little ways away and most often, pay to park.",

Had the biscuits and strawberries before breakfast and it was the most amazing thing I have had in a while. We came on a weekday after 9am and were seated right away.   I would've given them a 5-star, but I've been here for lunch and it was so loud, had to wait to get a table and I had a tummy-ache afterwards.   For breakfast however, I would come back, but I'll pass on lunch.",

    "text": "Maybe I waited too long to try this place? Maybe it was great when they first opened? Pretty solid 5 star rating on here, something is awry.   Came in on a Saturday morning, we had expected to wait so that was no big deal, gave us a chance to look over the menu and yelp pics.   After seeing all the reviews and praise for the Huevos Montulenos, I decided to give it a go, even tho on paper it sounded horrid. I like weird combinations, so I was willing to give it a shot. My friend got the Eggs Benedict.   Food arrives. A few bites into our food, both of look at each other, and I know exactly what she is thinking. I told her mine was really gross and she agreed. I like peas, I like bananas and I love feta. But the combination of them with black beans and eggs and sauce didn't work for me. I made her give it a try and she was mad at me once she put it in her mouth (hey, sharing is caring). I tried her Benny's and I agreed they were underwhelming. Turkey bacon had no flavor, and the addition of spinach and tomatoes really overpowered the Hollandaise.   In addition to two terrible entrees, this place is ridiculously loud. I had to raise my voice a couple octaves to talk to my friend who was sitting 2 feet in front of me.   Overpriced  Loud  Gross food Parking sucks",

Hostess said they are seating in order yet I watched group after group be seated, all of which came after us.  Told hostess why not push two four top tables together rather than keep seating others before us.  I'm sure the food is ok, but truthfully never had and will NEVER go back!!!!!",

My parents raved about it and gave me the cool story of this up-and-coming neighborhood plus the investment opportunities given to local business owners while we were driving here. I was pretty hyped on arrival but left with a lot to be desired.   First, Pepsi products. Meh.  The $4 sparkling lemonade was poured into a glass from a bottle. No real fruit or labor. Definitely overpriced.  The pancakes were too bready  The Huevos Motulenos: Eggs, chili, beans, cheese, tortilla and... bananas? Would have been okay except for the bananas. Didn't add anything to it and definitely tasted as weird as it sounds.  Service was attentive so that knocks them up to 3 stars.",

Their Truffled Egg Sandwich is solid and so is the Eggs Benedict.  The Truffled Egg Sandwich comes with eggs, bacon, creamy feta cheese, wild mushrooms, chives, and is served on ciabatta bread with potatoes.  I was a fan of the Huevos Montulenos and would certainly recommend it for the slightly more adventurous eater...lots of flavors coming together to party on you palate.  The Huevos Montulenos consists of a tortilla layered with black beans, sweet peas, feta cheese, caramelized bananas or plantains, covered with two fried eggs, and finished with slightly spicy red and green salsas.  It is also served with a pile of potatoes.  The interior is aesthetically pleasing.  Artistic. Hip. Positioned well.  eat. fits perfectly in it's downtown surroundings...you could say that eat is right up DTLV's alley...no literally it is right up from that one alley downtown...on Carson...you know?  They are doing a lot of things right here, and I will be back again!",

I said ok I get that you can't give me a wait time but could you let me know if it's busy and she said \"No.\"  Well, if that's the kind of service you get when you call, not sure how service will be if we actually showed up. Been here 2 years ago and loved the food but don't think I'll be back next time we're in Vegas. No matter how good the food is, a little customer service goes a long way. Oh well.

Service was good, everyone was very friendly, and the decor is super cute & warm!   Our group ordered: fried devil eggs $8 - really yummy spin on your normal deviled eggs. Crunchy & spicy kick! Very interesting  Egg truffle sandwich $14ish - yummy and lots of flavors! I took a few bites and was almost a little overwhelmed with the truffle and eggs haha but the bf liked it and demolished his whole plate  Cinnamon biscuits-$8ish- I would give this 3/5. It was good but nothing too spectacular. The biscuit had good cinnamon flavor and they do give you a good portion of fruit which I appreciated.   Huervos M something haha my friends ordered this and they both really enjoyed it. They said it had a spicy yet sweet kick (they have bananas in it!) I didn't get to try it but they both also devoured their plates   Overall a pleasant experience, and it's nice place to be away from the strip, but nothing stood out too much to me, probably would try another brunch place next time!",

    "text": "Not sure how eat. garnered all this hype, but it's a solidly mediocre \"New American\" spot. The concept and the space resonate with me, but the devil is in the details and the execution just isn't there.   For starters - the service is not there. Neither our hostess nor our waiter were particularly warm or accommodating. Our table didn't have any silverware - not even after our coffees were served. We instead had to ask for them as our food was coming out. We noticed this happened with a bunch of other tables as well. The waiter just couldn't be bothered to do anything beyond the bare minimum necessary.   As for the food - the food was decent. The truffled egg sandwich that everyone raves about was a-ok for an egg sandwich in my book (a $12 egg sandwich btw). I was most excited about the mushrooms and truffle flavors - but it was disappointingly light on the mushrooms and the truffles. I maybe caught only one bite that had a hint of truffles. The sandwich also comes on a giant toasted ciabbata roll that wasn't sliced - a minor detail, but those details adds up.   The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was decent - the biscuit is more like a toasted chunk of cinnamon bread. Not particularly buttery or hard on the outside like a True biscuit. The strawberry compote was good - it came with some fresh strawberries and blackberries. Another minor detail- but the leaves weren't removed from the strawberries. The color of the tiny leaves didn't add anything aesthetically - and needing to remove them just became a bit of a pain in the butt.  I'm impressed by how far downtown Vegas has come. Eat. is a good choice if you're looking for generally reliable, slightly more hipster brunch food - but given all the options in Vegas, eat. wouldn't be my first choice.",

He told us that we had to eat here for at least one meal so the next morning we decided this would be a good place to have breakfast.   It's a cute little restaurant right across the street from the Container Park. It's a small place so I imagine it fills up quickly during peak times. The decor was very modern with a twist. It was very clean and sleek. I loved the open bar looking into the kitchen or the large table in the middle. Overall, just cute place. I agree with my Yelp friend Eric J, this place would fit in perfectly in Midtown Sacramento and I would be there a LOT!   We were promptly greeted and seated (I like it, it rhymes!). I never eat pancakes but decided that I needed them and with a side of their thick cut bacon. My husband ordered the special Eggs Benedict. My pancakes were delicious; they were cooked perfectly and were super fluffy! I also appreciated that they come with jars of real syrup versus the fake stuff. The bacon... it was out of this world good and there were like 5 or 6 pieces so plenty to share. My husband LOVED his eggs benedict (well except for the surprise tomatoes on top haha).   Atmosphere was great. Service was great. Food was great. Prices were great. No complaints here, I highly recommend it!",

Came on a Sunday morning really looking forward to it, it was busy and we were told there would be about a 20 minute wait . In the meantime, we browsed the menu which was very simple. Not too many options to choose from and wasn't too impressed by the menu but I figured it would still be worth it because my friend had recommended it. Well, 20 mins went by and everyone waiting before us was seated. There were open tables and not too many people waiting after us. Our name was called and we noticed at least 5 open tables. When the waitress saw it was me and husband, she said she called the wrong table and asked for us to wait another 10 mins while a table of 2 was finished eating. I don't understand why she couldn't seat us at a table for 4 when there was plenty of open tables. Needless to say, I was very disappointed at the customer service. We waited 10 minutes and she still wasn't ready for us so we left.",

    "text": "3.5 is more accurate, but Yelp doesn't get down like the figure skating judges, so I guess neither do we.   Again with the hippy movement. When did Nevada become crunchy granola? I mean, I am sure it took place without anyone asking my opinion and that's fine, I get it. Hippy is cool in a not so cool kinda way. It's like hipsters and their man buns. It's not cool, from the perspective of grown up male adults. But, maybe they place their hair in the bun because that one drunk chick at the club who was kinda sorta cute said \"oh. M. gee!\"   Like this:  My folks are a product of the 50's and were knee deep in the REAL hippy movement out here in SF. If you told my Dad that the hippy culture was cool and that people selectively chose to become hippies and refused to wash their hair n clothes n stuff and they were attempting to recreate 1960's Berkeley, he'd respond with a simple, monotone voice of \"Why would anyone want to do that?\"  That out of the way, the crunchiness at this spot is not for me. I live in an area of the country where the crunch in crunchy was created and I shop at Berkeley Bowl every now and then, so there!!!  Coffee was really good and really fresh. Locally roasted and I am a huge fan of local coffee. On account of the evil mermaid movement and all.   Food was ok. Not amazing not send it back terrible just flat out ok.   Truffled egg sandwich had a few bites of delicious and a few more bites of bland. It was odd cause with each delicious bite, I expected the next bite to follow suit. Inconsistent cooking on that order I guess.   Pancakes were dark, in a good way and pretty solid. They serve a tiny jar of fresh maple syrup with it. Nice touch.   Expensive, as expected in Vegas but we just ate at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and we chowed there. Chowed as in ordered enough food for 3, but it was just the two of us. This spot shouldn't be in the same price range as that spot, but it is and I'm not intrigued nor interested in that.  As plenty of women have expressed over the years, it's not you, it's me. So I'll end my review with that and allow you to crunchy it up out in the desert if you so desire.",

It comes with a poached egg, but I went scrambled bc in that person. The accompanying toast is hella good. So fluffy and thick.   Shrimp and grits: My brunch companion ordered this and loved it. I'm personally not a shrimp gal, but I trust his recommendation.   A-la-carte Pancake: Effffff this pancake was divine. So thick and fluffy and doughy all at the same time. I could live on this pancake. We asked for some strawberry jam to go with. Do that.   Chicken apple sausage: just simply excellent. Lovely complex taste as you go.   The servers were awesome.

Located on the 1st floor of an apartment building at the corner of Carson St. & 7th St., \"eat.\" is a casual & trendy restaurant known for its upscale American breakfast/lunch entrees w/ southern & New Mexican touches, while using quality & locally sourced products. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=sloCm07roLTYRRVg5PHCJQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>   During a recent Vegas trip during Spring break, my son & I had our 1st meal in Vegas - breakfast at eat. on a weekday mid-morning.  Our entrees were delicious, & the presentations were eye-catching. We had the following:  - Golden-brown pancakes w/ chicken-apple sausage ($9). This order came w/ thick pancakes w/ a grilled chicken-apple sausage sliced down the middle & garnished w/ powdered sugar & a strawberry sliced in half. The pancakes, crispy at the edges & so fluffy & soft on the inside, were perfectly done.  They were so delicious & were the best that I've tasted! They came w/ butter & cute little sealed jars of 100% maple syrup from Vermont, instead of the sticky tabletop syrup dispensers; the pancakes were so flavorful that you really didn't need to use that much syrup. The entree is so generous that I could not finish it; next time, I'll just have a side order of one pancake to satisfy my craving & try another entree. The full order would have been good to share amongst a group of people. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=d371vDGyCTtrV47Wfezxig\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>   - DWBLTA w/ fresh made-from-scratch tomato soup & pickle ($11). This sandwich is their version of a BLT consisting of smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado w/ chipotle mayo on buttery toasted sourdough.  (DW stands for Don Welch, who is one of the restaurant's investors.) I was impressed w/ the thick slices of smoked bacon & avocado, which made the sandwich very creamy & savory; the ingredients complemented each other very well. The tomato soup was very flavorful.  This entree is a winner! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=KfcNl_Zk82sijLfZcCy5Rw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>   We chose the above two entrees based on the resounding comments posted in other Yelp reviews. They also have other popular dishes which we will try  the next time:  chicken fried steak, shrimp & grits, beignets, huevos motulenos, eggs done in different ways, salads, many types of sandwiches (roast beef, chicken, grilled cheese, veggie burger, Rueben, shrimp), & freshly made chips. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=HaumAEuf9JqmIJP_lQej4g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=epkj9L81E8G3DUDyjjNq5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xKU896f0iS1uFBqYkSFEgg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>   Service was very attentive, as the servers, in their signature black attire, ensured that our orders came quickly, dirty dishes taken away promptly, water glasses refilled regularly,& periodic checking in assuring that everything was okay. In fact, I found out afterwards that chef/owner Natalie Young will appear in the dining room & converse w/ diners to get feedback in improving her operation (I don't recall if she did talk to us, as I didn't know who she was at that time.)  The restaurant seats about 60 people. The interior is full of charm w/ a mixture of brick & green walls & a cemented floor. The walls are adorned w/ artwork of local artists.  There are orange metal chairs made from recycled materials, partial booths of a green color, tables, & a bar counter facing an open kitchen. Fabric napkins are used. Cute recyclable boxes are used for doggie bags. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=zsaULVQQOqXcBg4WOb7eBA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=4Pp0OeG2PEltnI1XhuvK-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=1XAw57xgR3526XmFH1h4Tw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>   Opened in Sept. 2012, eat. was the first restaurant to be part of the Downtown Revitalization Project in luring businesses to be part of the permanent venture. Its chef & owner, Natalie Young, was tapped for this restaurant; she had 12 years of previous experience at restaurants on the Strip, such as Hard Rock Cafe, MGM Grand, & Paris LAS. She named the restaurant \"eat.\" to describe a place where locals can come, eat, & talk/enjoy one another. In its first 34 days of opening, the restaurant served 2,300 customers!  Metered curbside parking available.  No reservations taken. We did not have a problem in finding a parking space, nor did we have to wait to be seated, probably because it was midmorning on a weekday; we heard that there are lines on weekends.  Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so we can eat at eat.!",

I sat at the counter since I was solo and it was comfortable. In fact, I enjoy how comfortable the restaurant feels in general.   I ordered the free-range chicken sandwich with tomato soup- perfect on a cold day! The sandwich was perfect. The chicken was so moist and flavorful, the arugula crisp and the tomatoes on point! The ciabatta bread was grilled perfectly. Everything fit together wonderfully. I can't wait to go back and have  another. I'm only disappointed that eat. isn't closer to my home! If you're in the downtown area I highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "Hubby and I were staying at The Fremont and I found this place on yelp, so we walked over for breakfast/lunch.  The vibe inside is much more Reno-like than Vegas....ie bare, stark, eclectic.  We were seated immediately and our waitress came right over.  Two cups of coffee, great cups, good coffee.  We opted for one pancake to share and it was big, but nothing special.  More like Denny's than even homemade.  We also split their deviled egg appetizer.  The take eggs, remove the yolk, coat the whites in panko breadcrumbs and fry them.  They're not served warm, so that part is ok,  then they make the yellow part deviled and top it with Sriracha sauce, bacon (which we omitted due to hubby being a pescatarian) and maybe green onions.  Very interesting from a texture standpoint, but nothing amazing in the taste zone.  Four halves = $8....too high.  We each ordered the Killer Grilled Cheese, which is billed as aged cheddar on sourdough, served with kick-ass tomato soup.  The bread was thicker than Texas toast, with a nice crispy buttery browned crust.  There was this almost translucent slice of cheddar cheese which had no discernsble flavor due to the overwhelming presence of the bread.  The tomato soup had a hint of basil, a super runny base and a few chunks of tomatoes.  It was served in a beautiful large bowl and if it was a scant cup, if that.  The duo was certainly not worth the $9 price tag.  All in all, two coffees, two grilled cheese and soup, one pancake and two deviled eggs was almost $50!    Might be a good place for a one off if you want a quasi trendy breakfast place but I really don't think we would ever return.",

Usually the wait for this place is pretty long & people are hanging out outside waiting to be called in. Fortunately, today the odds were on our favor! No wait to be seated!   We first had ordered strawberry cinnamon biscuits which were to die for! They were biscuits swimming in this strawberry jam sauce. It wasn't too sweet but decently sweet enough.   I had ordered the Shrimp & Grits! Which is, hands down, the BEST, grits I ever had. Usually restaurants over cook or under cook grits but this place makes it to perfection. It had picco di gallo on top which added a Little kick in your mouth. The bacon on the bottom just added the necessary flavors to this dish. I finished the whole thing! & could've licked the bowl but controlled myself.  Only thing I really had an issue with was the wait to get our food. Due to the table next to us of 3 men that practically ordered the whole menu, we had to wait a long time for our food. The men were extremely entertaining because one guy would net pick the dishes to the waitress-- \"this needed more salt\" or \"would have tasted better seared\" LOL! But anyways, it was defiantly worth that wait!",

Husband got the farm fresh chicken sandwich with house made chips. Probably one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Everything about it was great, the bread, condiments, aioli and chicken were amazing. I got the roast beef, I'm a sucker for picked onions so I got so excited! Wasn't as good as I was hoping, but man that chicken sandwich I'll never forget. Chef - you absolutely know what your doin. Keep it up, fantastic! Will recommend your restaurant to anyone.   Service: fantastic! Got a couple recommendations from another foodie server. We were only in town for one night so we had to make everything count. Absolutely amazing! We just chit chatted with a couple of servers for a couple minutes.   By far one of the best brunch places in Vegas. Just a couple minutes from freemont street. If your down there and hungry, GO!",

It's a cute little restaurant, with pretty good food. Service was so-so. Better than any of the restaurant food at The Cal anyway!  I was \"told\" by my friend, to get the Huevos Montuenos, but I didn't.  LOL.  Got the corned beef hash with poached eggs, which was pretty good.  Toast is huge, I LOVE BREAD!  Kind of expensive, and not as good as some of the cutie breakfast places here in Honolulu, but for downtown, I was happy not to have to eat at the Cal's breakfast buffet. OH, stop at the Container Park on the way back!  Cute little center with lots of snacks and a cute toy shop!",

    "text": "Right in so many ways. I was hoping for good eats, but wasn't 100% sure what to expect. What I got was a complete treat for all my senses.   We went for Sunday brunch, and when I walked in, I did think, \"Man, this place is loud,\" but when I saw a live DJ in the corner, I couldn't help but smile. The entire vibe makes you feel like ish is happening here every day. The interior is just perfect with concrete floors, spring-like colors and an open kitchen for you to witness the creation of your eats. We ate at the counter and loved it.   Service was a little aloof, but I was too distracted by all the tattoos to really care. I think they just really mean business.   The menu itself is a work of art worth reading down to every last bite. The dishes are creative and well-thought out. You know there is a real love of food just by reading the possibilities. We ordered the Huevos Motulenos, Turkey Benedict (only available during weekend brunch) and a short stack of pancakes ($5!!). The Motulenos features a mind-dizzying array of ingredients, including sauteed bananas! Mixed in with two chilis and a variety of beans, it turned out to be a delicious dish of sweet and spicy. And, the breakfast potatoes were legit. Basically, chop up a potato and make it sizzle. A True tater. The Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach was also a winning combination of flavors. I swear I tasted basil, but whatever I tasted, I approve. The only slight complaint there was that it came out lukewarm.   Now, the pancakes deserve their own paragraph, but can be best summarized with one word: perfect! They managed to have crispy, but not burnt, edges and a soft, milky center. They were the perfect thinness, making it all too easy to devour a short stack all by your lonesome.   Worth noting: While the weekday menu includes tofu scramble and a tofu banh mi, I didn't notice any vegan options on the brunch menu. Might be worth calling if you're a vegan headed there for a weekend brunch.    My only other minor complaint is that I thought the coffee was a little weak. However, that in no way prevents me from respecting this culinary gem. It's just so cool, a True Vegas original.",

I had the Bleu cheese Roost Beef which was delicious and the chips are made fresh and a great crunchy accompaniment to the meal.

I've seen a lot of my downtown buddies post photo after photo on instragram about this this lovely little cafe that I just knew I'd have to get my eat. on and get it on with the quickness.  First and foremost, bring quarters. All the parking near the restaurant is quartered. When we arrived we didn't have quarters. As soon as we walked in, the lady who greeted us with a warm smile, saw the two dollars in my hand and gave me change, saying she was \"prepared!\"  My friend and I were seated quickly and given menus that had us drooling and boggled as to what to order. EVERYTHING looked so good and the dishes fellow patrons were munching on looked divine, too.  Our food arrived quickly and promptly. It was love at first bite. You can taste the freshness and the quality of the food. Each dish was made with love. Even the homemade jam had that je ne sais quoi magic to it.  The service was amazing, there was a great sense of teamwork among the staff, I felt as if we had a not one server, but an entire crew.  The cafe is beautiful and modern. Black and white, with bright green flourishes. The kitchen was open and clean. Nothing hidden. The lady who greeted us, came over during our meal and introduced herself as the owner and thanked us for checking the place out. I was thoroughly impressed.  From great service, to great food, to a locally owned place. I love eat. I can't wait to head downtown and eat here again.",

    "text": "I hate to be that guy, but yes, Anthony Bourdain led me here.   We spent the afternoon exploring Freemont Street and towards of end of our exploring found ourselves hungry. I knew this place was in the area and after a quick Google search, found it to be on a couple of blocks from where we were.   So from Freemont Street we walk over. It's about 1PM on a Wednesday. We're seated immediately. After our hot walk through the sun we were pretty damn thirsty. Sadly, we waited over 5 minutes for our waitress to stop at our table and then another few minutes just for her to grab us some waters.   Before I go to into detail on the service, let's talk about the food. I have no complaints. It's a breakfast/lunch place. It's sandwiches. My seared chicken sandwich was pretty good. Juicy, and the house made mayonnaise was solid. Also, their potato salad is on point. Again, very good. My fiance ordered the Reuben and honestly it was huge. I had a bite and really could just tell by the look of it that it was going to be good. Good/great food and for the price I had no complaints.   Now the service on the other hand? Not so great. I noticed the sign near the door that said maximum occupancy was 86 people. There were maybe 20-25 people, if that? And three waiters/waitresses for those tables. So when I said I was pretty thirsty when we walked in, I really was. I downed my water in a minute or two and then sat there for the next ten minutes looking for our waitress who was nowhere to be found. I noticed she was waiting on our table and the table of four next to us. Then a different guy came up and started waiting on us. Okay, no big deal. He stops at our table and asks if I want more water - the glass is empty and we don't even have our food yet...what the hell do you think?!?  Female waitress eventually comes back after the male waiter dropped off our food. She asked if we needed anything, etc etc. She then disappears again and that was the last we saw of her basically. Male waiter brought our bill and rung it up.   Overall the food was good and the price was fair but the service needs some work. I shouldn't be waiting ten minutes for a refill on water. And why did my original waitress just disappear? And why is this all happening with maybe 25 people in the place?   Bottom line is I would hate to see this place packed and with a line of people waiting to be seated. Bourdain brought me here by watching his show, but I'm not sure I'd be running back the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Impressive and totally unexpected; a healthy, trendy, farm to table eatery in the sketchy confines of  Downtown Vegas.    Serving only breakfast and lunch.  Short but well thought out menu that uses the same ingredients throughout.  Right to it, the fried to order beignets are phenomenal.  Crispy, lightly sweetened pillows topped with powdered sugar.  Eat them while they're hot, with the melting side of vanilla mascarpone and tart fruit jam.  Yum.  The egg white frittata filled with spinach, tomatoes, olives and feta is equally good.  Aggressively seasoned and not dry.   For lunch, the \"DWBLT\" (smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo sourdough sandwich) is vibrant and refreshing with a decent kick.  The grilled aged cheddar sandwich on sourdough with a fresh tomato salad a definite winner of a reinvented classic.  Good prices.  Friendly service.    Hopefully the menu evolves with the seasons.  For now, a welcome addition to the blah food scene of downtown but by no means a destination restaurant.  Side note - Thank you Vegas yeep Leonel M. whose review made me break my self imposed, five plus year hiatus from town to eat at Eat.",

Last night I craved for Vietnamese food, I searched Yelp and trusted Yelp in my search. I wound up with mediocrity.   This morning I decided to key in \"Best Restaurant In Vegas\". A restaurant named simply \"Eat\" ranked first. I viewed the website and saw photos of choices that worth salivating over. But the pictures on the interior settings remind me of neighborhood cafe. Right away I thought to myself, \"here we go again!\" But I took my chances anyway.   Wife asked where I was taking her. I said \"I'm taking you to a place that showed up first on my search on Google.   So we drove to a neighborhood in North Vegas. When I arrived and surveyed the neighborhood, my wife joked, \"wonder if someone might just open the front door and pull you in and rob you!\" Yes it is that kind of neighborhood.   Boy was I wrong about this place. When I got there, there's already a line.  Waited 25 minutes. But well worth it. BEST CAFE FOOD EVER FOR ME in Vegas. I can't say enough about this place.   Lisa if you are still here in Vegas. Best $30 meal for 2 I ever had.  Please go to EAT for brunch. You will thank me for it.",

Perfectly cooked pancakes and the sausage was amazing! Moving on to my meal-I had come here intending to have the chicken fried steak, a personal favorite! Then I laid eyes on the huevos motulenos. I had no idea what this was, and still don't! But I will be eternally grateful that I decided to try something new! It was like an explosion of flavors in my mouth! The waiter recommended I add avocado, good call! Seriously this had to have been the best breakfast I've had in a long time! I only wish there was a little more banana! The service was wonderful.

We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Country Fried Steak, and Huevos Motulenos. Everything was extremely tasty. Eggs Benedict was good, The Chicken Fried Steak was pretty good, the highlight being the potatoes, and the Huevos Motulenos was amazing. The Chile sauce on top was excellent. It had to be homemade with that rich smokey flavor. I haven't had peas and bananas go so good together since I was weened off of Gerber. Just a really great combo of sweet, savory, and spicy mixed in with egg yolk. Yum! One star deduction because our server was slightly less than pleasant, perhaps from the business, but that shouldn't be a factor especially when business equates to more tips. Anyway, good fun meal. I wish nothing but future success to Natalie Young and crew.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place a fair chance.  The food is good and  tad expensive,  $11 for a BLT with avocado a pickle and a choice of chips, potato salad or tomato soup.  Now I don't mind paying for the experience and food if it gave me that WOW factor.  However,  it is doubtful that I would make the trip down here again.   As a single diner I was passed up on a table that sat four people even though I was waiting prior to  the couple that was sat before me.  Apparently that  area is reserved for \"larger parties\" which I get, if it was in fact being made into a table to accommodate a large party.  However a two top was sat there instead of me.  Making me feel discriminated against.  I was then sat about five minutes later at a table that seats three.  When I brought the subject up with the manager I was told that is what the owner wants.  As another customer service individual I can be more understanding of a guest's feelings since it is all subjective and sometimes taken out of context.  But I will say this most of the other reviews are spot on with regards to poor customer service.  Guests make your business and to treat  a patron the way I was treated left me with a bad taste in my mouth that even the wonderful food could not take away.  Just at add insult to injury as I left,  there was a single diner sitting on the side where the \"large parties\"  were supposed to sit!",

Ordered the shrimp and grits and they were so terribly bland. I couldn't add enough salt. It was so bad in fact that I had them bring me something else which the waitress recommended as her favorite, the huevos ranchero I think. It was supposed to have plantains and they put bananas... yes, bananas. Anyone who has eaten a plantain knows bananas are not the same. So I had sweet mushy bananas in the mix of huevos ranchero. Most disgusting excuse for huevos ranchero I've ever tasted. They also put peas in it which confused me... I'm assuming they wanted to add color to the dish but didn't regard taste at all. To the chef: Look, if you're going to attempt to make cultural dishes at least learn flavors. Cute place, disgusting food, and the water tasted like hose water.",

I went last year when I was in Vegas and I knew that I had to come back.    It is the perfect little hipster hole in the wall in an \"up and coming\" part of town.  They have a spacious, sun-shining interior and a beautiful little patio too.   They occasionally have live music on the weekends during brunch which makes it the ultimate hipster hangout if that's your thing.  Let's get to the food...   Cinnamon Biscuits - shared with the table after a recommendation from the bus boy.  Pretty tasty and definitely worth sharing.  Probably too sweet and rich for a meal on its own.      Truffle Egg Sandwich - my boyfriend had this but I stole a few bites and it was delicious!  Scrambled eggs, mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil on ciabatta.  Can't go wrong.   BLTA - I had this sandwich on my first visit.  It's a great version of a BLT.  Add an egg to it for the perfect brunch dish.  Greek yogurt - tasty and hearty portion with fresh berries and granola.  A little heavy on the granola and could have used some more yogurt to balance it out.    Service... The service at eat. is great and we always end up with a server that is a little odd in all the right ways.  Very personable and chatty with random comments that add to the vibe",

There was a little wait, 25-30 minutes which was expected since it was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show.  Got the cinnamon biscuits in strawberry compote for an appetizer for four people. Our group ordered poached eggs over corned beef hash, Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon, shrimp & grits, & your basic American breakfast-eggs, bacon, toast, & pancakes. Our appetizer-I barely tasted any cinnamon. The biscuits were OK but thought the strawberry compote would be paired better with something else. However, the compote was refreshing and good. After having a sample of everyone's dishes, I like the shrimp and grits the best and the fluffy pancakes the second. I did not like the Eggs Benedict (who invented turkey bacon?) and my corned beef was not that great.  I thought the plates all had a beautiful presentation but many of the flavors did not come together for me. There were other items I would love to try but after sampling several dishes, I'm not in a hurry to come back here but not opposed to it if someone wanted to come here.  Service was good and we were constantly checked on but felt like they were trying to hurry us for the next table. Good for people waiting. I'm not one to linger after I finish eating so it wasn't a big deal.",

While waiting for our food, the waiter puts down a side plate of packets of butter and 2 miniature containers of syrup. My friend and I decided to ask the owner about her choice of serving pre packaged butter and syrup. She told us it was more sanitary, they could tell how much syrup each customer used, and was more cost effective. Her answer was satisfactory until I really thought about it and my side of English muffins came out. The butter packet was on top of the English muffin and it was barely toasted and soggy. I thought to myself how many times those butter packets have been handled and how unsanitary it was sitting on top of my English muffin.   On to the two eggs breakfast I ordered and my friends golden pancakes. The breakfast was fine however, the chicken apple sausage was very greasy. My friends pancakes were tasty but also greasy and the portion was ginormous.",

    "text": "This place right here has been one of my favorite breakfast joints in Vegas for the last couple years. It's located right in the middle of downtown in perfect walking distance from a lot of things I like to do and be around and my job. Their menu is always fresh and always changing, the staff has never been anything but great anytime I've been there. I would highly recommend the Benedict. It's probably one of my not so secret addictions. The atmosphere is on point where it's laid out well and you're able to have a conversation with whoever you're eating with whether it's inside or outside.  Now, if you're wondering why this place only gets a 4 and not a 5, it's because this place in my eyes can only be considered a breakfast place and not a brunch restaurant. The big distinction is that brunch requires alcohol and they don't serve that here. That in itself is literally the one thing that is wrong with this place. If they added mimosas and/ or Bloody Mary's and kept the quality of food the same, they would probably put some of the brunch places in town out of business",

    "text": "We checked this place out 3 weeks ago while we were Vegasing (v. to Vegas, to loose your money, to enjoy life).  I have not stopped thinking about this place since and how desperately I need one in L.A.  The Eggs Benedict were spot on. It's a menu item that many places carry and many places fall short and EAT did not. And on top of that, the breakfast potatoes were full of flavor. Usually the sides are just filler, but not these. It was hard to decide which food to eat next, do I focus on the eggs benny and hope I have room for the potatoes or do I alternate bites in hope that I won't get full before the end--oh the pressure! I have never wanted to not be full in my life. I wanted to eat all the eggs benny forever and ever amen.  I also had an iced coffee. I can't recall the name of the coffee they carry, but it was fantastic. No gross after taste. So then brings another dilemma, do I sip the coffee and enjoy it or do I just chug it because it's so freaking good.  My husband got a sandwich (can't remember the name) and it too was tasty. And their homemade chips on the side, whaaaaaattttt?! Much thin many flavorful.   We headed there Sunday Brunch-ish and it was a 15 minute wait, but the entire staff worked hard to make sure our food didn't take forever. And all the waiters were very attentive.  I had a wonderful experience here and am considering driving the 4 hours just to eat here, it's that good. After Vegasing all weekend I feel like I gained something at Eat, a healthy appetite for more!",

Awesome stuff - it came on a super soft ciabatta bun with fluffy scrambled eggs, grilled wild mushrooms in truffle oil, and two monstrous strips of bacon on it.  The house potatoes were rather good although I'm normally more of a hash brown guy  The shrimp and grits were worth fighting over.  Strips of bacon covered on creamy grits, egg over easy, shrimp cooked to perfection with a pico de gallo type sauce over it.   Our server suggested a side of sourdough to dip in the grits which was a great suggestion.    Anthony Bourdain was right, this place rocks. Now food coma has set in and we just have to find a cab to get back to the hotel",

Service was nice from the start and carried over well, however a little slow at some points.   The food was spot on though.   My wife had the eggs benedict which was awesome, although the Hollandaise was a bit more citrusy than I'm used to.   Still very good though.   I ordered the corned beef hash and loved it.   I must say that this was the first time I've ever had corned beef hash where the chunks of fresh corned beef out numbered the potatoes 2 to 1 !    It really was good though with chunks of meat and onion and potato.  Maybe next time we'll try some of the pancakes because they looked really good!",

    "text": "This is my very first review.  Usually, I don't have issues...but this place has gotten more positive reviews than it deserves.  I kind of depend on YELP reviewers to help me decide where I'm going to spend my hard earned cash or in this case, cash I won at the casinos.    Our table ordered several dishes and we all shared.   The Chicken Fried Steak was amazingly tough given the fact that the inexpensive cut of beef was tenderized!       The dwblta was served with a very hard, unripe, and inedible avocado.    The \"made to order\" beignets came to the table fresh out of the fryer.  They \"looked\" very good.  Unfortunately, they were very dense and really needed a lot of jam and mascarpone to give enough flavor.   I'm not sure whether they were really \"made to order\" or just \"refried \" to order.  The Huevos Motulenos dish wasn't too bad....actually not bad at all, but the potatoes were tasteless.     The coffee was good.  But, the mug it came in looked as if it had been previously used.  Coffee drips were on the front and back of the mug....not necessarily from someone drinking from it...but none the less, not a clean looking mug.  Later, I asked some server walking by to get me a clean mug, and without hesitation did so and filled it with fresh coffee.      We asked for an extra plate and got the smallest plate possible.  So, we asked again and finally received one after a wait.  We asked for extra jam and immediately got the jam, as well as attitude from some tattooed server/cashier.     The servers were many...in fact there were so many different ones coming to our table to do things (two to take our order, two others to serve, another one to get the plate, and yet another one to bring the attitude, and still another to bring the check or it could have been the same one....bottom line it would be nice to have just one who tends to our table.   (BTW, our initial servers who took our order were out the door by 9ish that morning. We couldn't figure that one out.  Maybe that was why it seemed we had so many different servers plus it appeared some were in-training.)   I paid and left a small tip because not every server there was lacking \"good waiter\" qualities.    There are so many restaurants competing for our business and thanks to YELP it makes it a little easier to decide.  But it is unfortunate when customers don't take the time to critique bad experiences.  What we experienced today does not appear to be a one time thing.....but a lack of control over the quality and preparation of the food and the disregard for its customers experience.  I was disappointed that I wasted my money and  I will  NOT be coming back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I was really- I don't know- disappointed with Eat. My friend had talked about this place she was so excited to go and our experience was not good.   First when we got there our server just kept trying to up sell us. Try once but then read your customers and stop. We sat down and she asked us if we wanted beverages and both of us just said water, and she was like \"no coffee, juice?\" No just water, she said okay and then i cant remember if she asked us if we wanted sparkling water or bottle water, so again we both said \"no just regular water with some ice please.\" That kind of irritated us.   Then my friend had read on yelp that the chilaquiles were better if you asked to have the egg fried instead of scrambled. While we were looking at the menu, my friend kept reminding me to have her egg fried. The server came back and asked us if we wanted to order- i was still looking so we said we needed a minute. And she again was like \"oh well can i start you with something biegnets maybe, our biegnets are really good.\" We were going to split biegnets so we just ordered them but after being pushed about the drinks the server was just kind of irritating us.   The biegnets- huge disappointment. I know there are different schools of thought on who likes what type of biegnets- I personally like light fluffy biegnets. These ones were the doughy thick biegnets- which the main downfall is the dough soaks up a lot of oil. As soon as we picked up the biegnets the oils saturated everything, my fingers, it was half and inch into the biegnets, I used napkins to soak up the excess oil- this is just a huge turn off. Of the six we only ate two. Which is sad because had they been good we would have been fighting over them and probably ordered seconds.  The server comes back and we place our breakfast order- my friend asks for the chilaquiles but wanted to change the egg to a fried egg. The server responded with \"oh well thats our signature dish so its really designed to be eaten the way we have it on the menu.\"- omg I so wanted to say \"well yelp is designed to help customers improve their experience at a restaurant.\" The server would not change the eggs, my friend just got frustrated and ordered shrimp and grits- which the server then said, \"yeah maybe youll like that better.\". For me I just ordered one pancake- mainly because the biegnet kind of ruined things for me. The server looked at me and was like \"one pancake? are you sure you can get a short stack of two for $6.00 our pancakes are the best ever you might want to do that.\" Again i can read the menu I took time to look over the options, i saw there was a short stack and no i would just like ONE pancake thanks. After repeating myself she said \"do you want to add eggs, or bacon or sausage?\" Again no, just the pancake.   Our food- When the shrimp and grits came I could just tell my friend was going to be disappointed- the bacon was not crispy it actually looked under cooked, where the fat on the bacon is still white and flabby. The grits looked okay. I could not try it because im allergic to shrimp- but then again i dont think I would have wanted too. After having grits from Lola though, I knew those grits at Eat could not compare. I asked my friend how did these grits rank compared to Lolas. And she replied \"Lolas is a 10 and these are a ZERO.\" bummer.   My pancake was good. Its served really cute with a little personal jar of syrup. I wouldn't say its the best pancake ever- i still think my favorite pancakes are at Babystacks. It is a good pancake though.  Then our bill- our server mysteriously disappeared and no other servers seemed to want to help us out so we waited a bit- like a while for our server to reappear. She brought us our check and we placed two cards in it. When we got our check back there was a note inside that said \"During busy times we request you do not split checks. Thanks\" That's kind of what did it for me. I was thinking well you know what we request that you get competent servers then. Most of us in Vegas have worked at one time or another in the food industry at busier places then Eat and have had to split checks- learn your trade and multitask.   So I wouldnt go here again- Id rather go to Babystacks any day.",

Their policy is they wont seat you until the whole party is present. Yes maybe a friend or two is running late, but to see the place empty full of open chairs, and still they won't seat you, now that's different service.  There's also this discomfort of eating when the owner just seats there and watch her servers do their job. She'll correct them discreetly but not so privately. I've seen owners help out by greeting you or seating you, but this one is different. She just seats in her throne. I am more about interaction with your customers, but never in the three visits have I seen her interact with customers.   Like I said, food is good, but not memorable.",

I imagined that I would enjoy this place more if I had recently rolled out of bed with a bad hangover. The lighting dark- again, I think the target market for this restuarant is those with terrible hangovers or frequent migranes.",

The service was ok although everyone seemed bugged at us asking questions like do you serve alcohol (no) do you have peanut butter (no) is there anything off the menu (no but then yes when asked about an online advertised eggs Benedict) my friend got the eggs Benedict it had spinach and applewood bacon (delish) I got the chilaquiles so good! Very clean flavor pallets and we also had a short stack to share FYI way too much food none of it was finished but all was really good! I don't live near down town so won't frequent but won't be top on my list either.",

On to the food, I ordered  the bacon and eggs , it was very tasty and the freshly sliced wheat bread was thick and delicious , no problems at all with quality of food, however the prices seemed a bit high for what you get, (in the 14 dollar range) which I thought was several dollars over priced compared to what other breakfast stops in the area offer, also the 8 am opening time seemed like mid day for several east coast diners waiting for open along with me. Enjoy Vegas - Stay in the Sunlight\"",

The people there were very attentive and nice even though it was the lunch rush and they were pretty crowded. Took my order efficiently and brought it out in the amount of time they said would take (due to parking I was in a rush and was doing takeout) Got two sandwiches. I got the veggie burger. The burger was good with the avocado on top but oh my I couldn't find it underneath all that bread so it was quite messy as I took most of the bread off. He had the roast beef and he liked it but again not as much meat as salad components it seemed. Gave him my potato salad and he said it wasn't mayo but not sure what it was... Ranch based? He did like his potato chips.  If they put the veggie burger on thinner bread as it said wheat but didn't look like wheat, and more meat on his it would have been better. Glad I tried it and would go if a group was going to get breakfast options but not somewhere I would seek out.",

The atmosphere is nice (love the art) and despite it being busy they were on there game with service! Alright now with FOOD: I started with the biscuits with strawberry compost, not overly sweet, moist, yummy starter. My mom got the eggs,bacon,potato dish. She enjoyed it!! I had the shrimp and grits which was very good! Never had it before and the flavors all blanched nicely! The bacon was especially good. I had a great experience and defiantly will be back!",

    "text": "Saxby and I ate lunch here today with some friends after trip to the Children's Discovery Museum. The food was ok but nothing really stood out to make me want to return. I shared the B.L.A.T. and the Shrimp Po Boy with the other adult we were dining with. Both came with a side of potato salad. When I think of a Po Boy I imagine a subroll bursting with fried shrimp shredded lettuce and tomato finished with delicious aioli. This \"Po Boy\" was on a ciabatta with sauteed shrimp, lettuce, tomato, bread and butter pickles and sriracha mayo. It was fine but I'll be heading over to Lola's soon to satisfy my Po Boy craving. The B.L.A.T. was good.  The best thing on the all of the plates was the pickle. It was a great pickle.  The boys had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The sandwiches were good but the soup was not good at all. It was so overwhelmed by garlic that I can still taste it now, hours after I had just a few bites. That brings me to my main complaint. They don't accommodate kids in any way. The drinks for the two four year olds were served in 16oz glass pint glasses, There is no kids menu and there's really not much on the lunch menu that kids would like except the grilled cheese and I've already talked about the soup that's served with it. My son isn't picky but he's also not adventurous either. He's a normal 4 year old. Perhaps I might return for breakfast but I think there are better choices in the area for lunch. (burp, ugh garlic)",

    "text": "Grits! Ask them not to put onions on top, and to bring butter and maple syrup, unhealthy heaven... We visited this place twice recently, once on a Tuesday morning, which was a five star visit, and then once on Saturday, which was a one and a half star experience, so I am averaging them out. Our first visit was in a large group, with four adults and three boisterous children, the waiter was unperturbed by our large group and we were seated pretty quickly at the communal table. I had the veggie burger, which was more of a large toasted sandwich of indescribable deliciousness, and an orange juice which, although \"regular\" in size was large and pulp free and quite wonderful. One of our friends had the shrimp & grits dish which she absolutely loved as well. The service was good, the food arrived quickly and the multiple servings of grits which my daughter mowed through were hot, scrumptious and seemingly bottomless. Now, Saturday... we waited an exceedingly long time for a table, the hostess told us it would be around 30 minutes, and we were seated in the busiest thoroughfare more than 45 minutes later. The waitress brought our menus, which were considerably smaller than the weekday menu and distinctly lacking in vegetarian options, and then disappeared for an extended period. We asked if they could do the veg burger but they said no, and at this point I didn't want to wait at another restaurant so we decided to stay, I eventually decided on the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, which does not come with chips - this was not noted on the menu where it actually says that all sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, but when I asked after the chips I was told they would be an additional side and that the soup, which was part of the meal on the menu, was in fact a side I had ordered. This was a rather awkward exchange and I gave up on my lovely chips. The soup was thin, and the cheese was lurid orange, plasticky processed American cheese instead of the \"sharp cheddar\" on the menu. This made me sad. The bread is doorstop thick and soft, which is a perk. We felt very rushed, and they brought the check before we had finished eating, or, in fact ordering, as well as removing dishes before we had finished eating. Its a really fabulous place to eat, during the week, but give the weekends a miss.",

We got here around 1:00 in the afternoon so most of the breakfast things we were not allowed to order. NOTETO SELF: come before 11am next time to try the other deliciousness. We were immediately seated and asked what we wanted to drink. By the time we had gotten our drinks, we knew what we wanted. I opted for the Hash and the boyfriend wanted a free whole range chicken?? sandwich. My hash came with the normal - potatoes, onions, peppers, and corned hash or whatever. It was really good. the portion was perfect too. It was topped with two poached eggs. When I cracked the yolk, it came oozing out all over the hash and potatoes..mmmm. It also comes with four half slices of thick sourdough toast! It was SO good. My boyfriend got the sandwich as mentioned and it also tasted really good. It tasted really..clean. It wasnt greasy, it tasted healthy and clean. It came with these chips that had some type of seasoning on it and the boyfriend could not stop eating them. We also got a side of chive potatoes. SO GOOD. The waitresses were all very friendly too. It was busy so we really didnt get a refill on our drinks until we were almost done with our meals. But then again, I didn't think it was THAT busy sinc there were open tables and all. Ill be back again for breakfast but will try to come at a time when its not so \"busy\".",

    "text": "Now that I work downtown, I've had to come up with new lunch options, and those options are few and far between downtown. But I prefer to support local businesses, and I rarely want to deal with the hassles of a casino, especially at lunch, so I thought I'd give Eat a try.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's in a sketchy neighborhood, but inside it's filled to capacity with downtown hipsters. Seating was quite limited so I opted to sit at the lunch counter. Not a great choice because I spent my whole lunch impeding the flow of waitresses and listening to the expediter shout orders. I kept thinking I should lend a hand and plate some food or deep fry something.  The food itself is good. I had the roast beef sandwich, potato salad and iced tea. The quality of the ingredients was above average, and they seem to take care with presentation and little added touches. But the price was what stopped me dead in my tracks. $16.50 plus tip for a sandwich, side and a drink. Ouch! I hadn't planned on spending $20 on lunch, and if I had, I would have gone someplace better.   I gave them a fair try, but unless I get a raise or someone else is buying, I won't be back. I'll leave the $4 cup of coffee for the hipsters.",

My mouth is savoring this exciting menu full of fresh ideas which is obviously created with lots of love.  Eat is perfect for vegetarians and meat lovers.  Tofu scrambles and Veggie sandwiches are listed right along with chicken fried steak and roast beef with blue cheese.  The menu is short enough to try it all in a week but with ample variety to make u wanna come back. Our server, Kenna is beautiful, super-sweet and bursting with enthusiasm for both her job and downtown Las Vegas. Not sure where they get their bread from (we tried the sourdough toast and the croissant) but it is SO fresh, light, delectable. The prices may seem a tiny bit high but this is definitely a get-what-you pay for kind of spot. I am so impressed I will not take any stars for as many onions as potatoes in the smash mix or that my BF's egg whites were too salty.  Kenna fixed it right away with smiles and a new, saltless order. I can't wait to come back for the black bean veggie chili!",

The first day I ordered the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and received 2 eggs with potatoes and chopped beef/steak. The beef wasn't cured at all or maybe it was old. Either way, it wasn't what I've received on previous visits. Ok, so at this point I'm going to give Eat the benefit of a doubt a revisit the next day. My mistake. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast and I think I could have chewed my leather shoes easier. The accompanying eggs and potatoes were good, but of course, the real challenge was making a delicious steak and they've failed. Remember, these choices were not new, so expectations were high and I was let down. I gave 2 stars for the friendly staff, but unfortunately that doesn't satiate my hunger. I doubt if I will ever return to Eat.",

The iced tea was very nice and the staff were courteous. It's also clean and attractive inside, metered parking outside.  I came in solo and wanted to sit near a window to enjoy the morning sun. Large windows with tables at them surrounded the dinning area. But they were tables for four and I was solo. But the whole place was 70% empty, there were 5-6 of these 'window' tables, and when I came in they were all EMPTY. All the patrons were either at the counter or crowded together in a dark pit-like seating area in the center. So despite my asking nicely they denied me a seat at the window.  I can understand saving those tables to accommodate parties of four when the place is busy, but if a customer wants to be seated at a window, you should just seat them there.  I hope the management rads this a makes some changes. It really does seem a nice place to eat, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with this seating nonsense.",

    "text": "Nice spot in Downtown. Right behind Container park, you can find \"eat\", which is a fairly nice place for brunch.   Overall the food was pretty good. Their egg Benedict (my first ever) was great and served with a side of potatoes and a plentiful single strawberry. I also had a bit of the Apple chicken sausage and cinnamon biscuits, which were also really good. The orange juice was good, but a bit pricey for me ($6), but it did have pulp, yum!   Service was decent. It was a busy Saturday morning with the Color Run in town that Might have overwhelmed the employees here, but think they did a decent job. It did take us about 25-30 for 3 of us to get seated, which we were completely okay with.   I love downtown and this place offers that uniqueness that every restaurant in downtown has. It has a lot of nice decor, seats are comfortable, and has a hipster-ish vibe to it.   Overall, I would definitely come back for brunch and recommend to anyone coming out of Vegas. Just be aware that this place closes a lot earlier than other places do in Downtown.",

Indeed it is on the corner of a cheap apartment. The place was fun and quirky inside and very busy. We went for lunch.  They had a very limited menu.  I opted for the grill cheese. It was huge and I mean huge. Talk about carb load. The bread was delicious soft and perfect texture. I could only eat one of the humongous slices the tomato soup was just okay tasted like tomato sauce with very little seasoning.  My hub had the chicken fried steak which was very tough and peppery  all in all I was not impressed with this place maybe we chose the wrong items. Our Neal total was 40 bucks. Too much.",

    "text": "First off, the food was FABULOUS. Then reason why I give this place 2 stars is because of the service/staff. Every point of contact from the hostess, to our server, and the food runner were rude, short, and had very bad attitudes. The hostess gave us a hard time about seating us when our table had already been set up with high chair and everything, but wanted to wait till the rest of the party showed up; which, understandable but you already set up the table. It seemed as though the service staff were so overwhelmed with the busyness that they were frustrated and were taking it out on us. After we told the hostess the rest of our party was parking, she made a snide remark that we need to order before they closed (and they closed in 2 hours). The food runner had dropped our food at the wrong seats so while we switched them she sighed and rolled her eyes. Our waiter dropped off our check before we were even finished eating our entrees without even asking for it. We then wanted to order more coffees and desserts after our meal, but didn't seem to have the option to because we felt rushed and pushed out. It's such a shame because all the food was absolutely amazing.",

Most of the food is just breakfast and lunch classics  prepared with the highest level of quality ingredients and short order cook skill. There are definitely a few inventive dishes that speak to the chef's talent, but for the most part the food at EAT doesn't reinvent the wheel. There is something to be said for simplicity. In my last few visits, I've ordered the fantastic Pozole as a starter. After that, you really can't lose with any of their selections. I particularly like the Shrimp and Grits for Breakfast and the DWBLTA for lunch.  After I've enjoyed my meal, I always buy a bag of their house coffee beans for the road. I like to continue enjoying EAT's bean juice for weeks after my trip.",

We were all starving and wanted something in the realm of breakfast/brunch food. We were very satisfied when we stumbled upon eat.  We only waited about 5 minutes to be sat and we all ordered coffees that came out very quickly. We spent some time browsing the menu because everything looked so good! I opted for the breakfast sandwich without the meat and subbed it for avocado. It was recommended by the waiter to do it that way and it was a great decision! My mom got the pancakes and they were amazing! I kept picking off her plate which wasn't a problem because the portions were huge.  This is a great place to go if you are looking for a pre-exploring downtown Las Vegas meal!",

    "text": "I've heard good things about this place from a friend who lives out of town, so I've been meaning to eat here for awhile now. On a Saturday morning I get a text from my friend who says he just flew in and the people he was supposed to hang out with on the Strip are all hungover and sleeping still, so my husband and I swoop him up from his hotel and suggest eat. since we wanted to show him the downtown area. The location itself is very unique and just walking distance from Container Parker. Being from SF/Bay Area, we're all used to extremely long waits for brunches, so eat.'s 20 minute wait was no big deal. Once we finally got seated, the 3 of us ended up in a 2-top that was in a corner. It was very.. cozy, but what's a little bit of discomfort among friends? The hostess was very sweet and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long, so I appreciated that. We ordered the corned beef, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and pancakes for the table. The pancakes were mouth-watering, and probably the best part of the meal, but one of the servers did give me grief about asking for more syrup (I swear the dinky little serving they give isn't enough!) My friend ate all of his corned beef, so he had no complaints; however, my husband hated his chicken fried steak with a passion. It was very tough - just looking at it you could tell it was completely dry and devoid of flavor. He left a large chunk of it uneaten and didn't bother taking it home. Since we didn't have that much room on the table, I wasn't really feeling my eggs benedict, so I placed it behind me in the booth and stuck to my pancakes. As other people have experienced, waiters are somewhat hard to track down. Someone who wasn't our waiter asked me if I was done with my benedict plate and if he could take it away. It was barely touched, so I'm surprised he didn't ask what was wrong and didn't ask if I wanted to take it to go (my husband eventually ate it at home to make up for his lack of a meal). Maybe we should have ordered a few different items like the truffled egg sandwich, but my husband probably would never want to come back here. I came here wishing that we had spent our morning eating at Mr. Mama's since I haven't been there yet. Hopefully that place doesn't disappoint. Eat. does look like they have a pretty big and devoted following, so I hope they continue to do better and improve on the shortcomings guests have pointed out as of late.",

Not only was it not good by itself, but dipping the grilled cheese/bread in it didn't help either. The Shrimp & Grits were downright not good, and I'd recommend strongly against ordering them.",

Their breakfast is pretty delicious, they have the biggest slices of bread that I have ever seen and their pancakes are ridiculously good!   I also fantasize about their cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote.  The few things that I don't like, is that we have never had a friendly waiter/waitress. For some reason, the 4 times I have been there, the waitstaff always acts like they are doing us a favor by helping us and they try to suggestively sell you sides of everything or bigger sizes of whatever you ordered, I understand the concept but it gets pretty annoying when you are trying to place an order on a table of 6 and 2 to 3 extra things are suggested to every person.   I also have to warn you that their veggie burger is terrible! So the next time I went I ordered another dish without the bacon and the waitress said \"we are too busy right now to make any substitutions\" uhmm I wasn't making a substitution, I just said no bacon.... Anyway!   Eat is actually worth a try because everything is made from scratch and their food is high quality, I just wish the staff was friendly.",

I had the shrimp & grits and a pancake on the side (I love pancakes) awesome savory satisfying dish, only thing I didn't like so much was my shrimp weren't hot. Not a fan of cold shrimp but it didn't take anything away from the flavor. The best part of the meal was the PANCAKE!! Sweet Baby Jesus the pancakes are like manna from heaven! Better than any pancake I've had EVER IN LIFE and I've eaten a lot of pancakes.   These pancakes were soooo delish, I had them 4 times that week... yes 4 times, i thought I was gonna need rehab. I believe they are laced with some sort of highly addictive drug and I mean that in the BEST WAY! I would eat these pancakes off the floor they are so good! I wanted to hugg and kiss the owner they are so good! I would fight my momma they are soooo good! I'm having withdrawal symptoms as I'm writing this review they are soo good!  If you're reading this, stop and go get some pancakes. Don't think just do it, i promise you your life will be brighter and filled with rainbows. They are soo good!",

Eat has the best breakfast in Vegas, the food never disappoints, service could be better some days, but mostly good. I love the atmosphere, right in the heart of downtown Las Vegas. However I wouldn't suggest placing to go orders because each time I've done so they make a mistake, but I always catch it. Still worth going back, food is that good!",

Gary, my waiter, said lines can start forming by 8:15am (opens at 8am!).  Food was SOLID!  I had the Eggs Benedict with potatoes (special that day) - good balance of flavors and perfectly poached eggs; single pancake - just the right amount of density and fluffiness, plus it came with real maple syrup; and coffee - good beans and roast.  Service was attentive and friendly.  I would totally come back!  P.S. Free parking on 9th and beyond if you don't mind walking a bit more.",

This establishment is downtown in a pretty rough area. It is behind the container park. It is one of those cool sexy new restaurants downtown. The staff is made up of a bunch of edgy hippie types. It's got a cool vibe to it. When you're there you feel hep. It's usually fairly crowded but they move people through quickly.   The food is unbelievably good. It is made fresh with the highest quality ingredients. You can really taste the difference. For example they used real maple syrup on their pancakes, fresh fruit, and thick applewood bacon. Who does that these days? Real maple syrup! Unbelievable!  Anyway, I would give them 5 stars except for the service. Maybe it is just the nature of the beast from being so successful but they can be somewhat aloof and no-nonsense to move the people through.  Be sure to give this place a try if you are looking for a great restaurant downtown.",

I loved the fresh berries and exciting cinnamon flavor. The berry compote was a bit much, but I'd rather have too much sauce than too little.  *Huevos Montulenos: 2/5 I had the huevos montuenos after recommendations from yelp and my love of hispanic flavors.  The bananas were WEIRD. Just, ugh, weird in the worst way. They absolutely, definitely should have been plantains. No question. The banana flavor was jarring and unpleasant with the salsas and eggs. Also the plate was split between red and green chile sauce, with the green sauce being far superior.  *Chive potatoes: 5/5 MMmmmmmm! So great!  *Truffle Egg Sandwich: 4/5 Good, if a bit plain  Service: 4/5 *So friendly!  The wait was massive though, even at noon for a breakfast place.  The wait was overestimated by double, which, I get not wanting to create False expectations, but overestimating to that extreme was also quite irksome.  Atmosphere: 4/5 So cute and definitely I light, lovely, casual brunch spot.",

Service was excellent, and attentive. The food spoke for itself. We got the biscuits with the fruit compote (biscuits were made in house), not too sweet which we loved. My husband got the chicken fried steak. The batter was delicious, very crispy...gravy was kind of sweet and also had some spice, delicious! I got the shrimp and grits. Came with over easy egg and pico de gallo on top. So fresh, so good! Food came so quick which was awesome because we were starving. The decor was clean and had an eclectic feel, which I loved. Honestly, I have no complaints! Recommend to anyone.",

Realy enjoyed the toast here. The portion size was fair but a little on the pricier side for a brunch item.   Eggs Benedict ($13): Wasn't my favorite item =/ breadding on bottom was sweet and turkey bacon was used instead of regular. Poo. I love turkey bacon but a girl's trying to get some delicious bad food in me while in Vegas!! However, the caramelized onions and potatoes were on point.  Free-Range Chicken Sandwich ($12): This dish sounds average and something you can get anywhere but my oh my. The chicken wasn't dry. The pesto, mozzarella cheese and pesto blend was beyond perfect. I tried savoring every last bite of it! YUM. I tend to lean more on brunch items during brunch hours but this dish is one to get!  All dishes were decently sized. Hipster type of atmosphere. Location is off.. it's underneath an apartment/studio complex! Lots of metered street parking for $1/hour. Something to try while out in Vegas!",

I pulled up by eat. only to find that there are only pay parking available.  $1 got me about an hour of parking. AJi%4adh !?Really? Ain't nobody got time for that.   ATMOSPHERE Small and quaint. Love the open kitchen and the whole design of this place. We went there little bit after they opened (8AM), and place was somewhat packed.   SERVICE Attentive and friendly staffs. Warm greetings in and out.   FOOD I was craving something sweet (Yes, from early in the morning). After scrolling through some pictures I knew I was sure to get their Cinammon biscuit. It;s a cinammon biscuit with strawberry sauce, garnished with raspberry and strawberry. Beautifully presented and it was good! Biscuit itself wasn't warm as I expected it to be and was very crumbly. I liked how strawberry sauce wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. 4/5  Also got to try Chicken fried steak which I had no clue of. Never had this in my life. I learned that although it's called chicken fried steak, it's not a real chicken. This southern dish is a steak that is coated with flour and pan-fried, like a fried chicken. I can't really compare this with chicken fried steak from other places as I never had it before, but I enjoyed this hearty dish a lot. Came with crispy potatoes and few toasts on the side. What a great way to start a morning...5/5  CONCLUSION Awesome place. Great breakfast/lunch join in Downtown. Will be back!",

My oh my the food was delicious. I ordered a short stack of pancakes ($6) and my husband ordered the truffled egg sandwich with a side of seasoned potatoes ($12). My pancakes were golden brown, thick, moist, and fluffy. They were hands down, the BEST pancakes I've ever had. The syrup presented with the pancakes was in an adorable little jar.

I was on a time crunch though, so when the rest of the party was still parking, the manager let me be seated first.  We were able to get a table right away and put in our orders before it got too late.  On a Saturday afternoon, I thought it was still busy.  Some parties had a short 10-15 minute wait.  This restaurant reminded me of Cheeky's in Palm Springs - very good brunch place with outdoor seating.  Food was really good.  As I was perusing the menu, I wanted to order everything!  I couldn't decide what to get because they all sounded really good.  My shrimp and grits had plenty of shrimp ($13).  I did not feel ripped off, and there were 2 big pieces of bacon in it!  The portion was enough to share with 2 people.  The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was perfect ($8). The 4 biscuits were not dry at all, and the compote was not too sweet.  They looked so cute - disc-shaped.  My friends who had Huevos Montulenos $12, Chicken Fried Steak $14, and the eggs benedict $13 thought their dishes turned out really well, too.  Everything pretty much had huge serving sizes.  I love that!  Next time I'll probably try the arugula salad or the pancakes..mm..  I really like the service here.  Everyone is so friendly and NOT stuck up, which is something I'm used to with a popular hipster cafe/restaurant.  The hostess was  accommodating, even though she had to get a manager to authorize seating us early..She was still nice about it.  Our server Marissa was nice and helped us quickly since we were in a rush.  I will definitely be back next time!",

I arrived at 1240p and waited less than 5 minutes for a table.  The place was busy - plenty of locals (business folks), which is always a good sign.  The water was served promptly and the waiter was back to take my order right on time.  Service appears to be a team effort here and they are good at it.  Manager was present and actively working.    I had a Chicken Cesar (easy on the dressing) and a side of turkey bacon.  Both were served quickly and the salad was exactly as I requested.  The chicken was fresh and flavorful, nicely sliced.  The lettuce was first-rate and crisp.  And the bacon was awesome.  This was an excellent meal.  I had coffee for dessert and again it was hot, super-good and fresh.  eat is popular for a clear reason.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "First off we arrived at around 11:30am and this place was packed! Looked like it was a hot ticket! We went here for our friend Lisa's birthday and celebration of her pregnancy. We brought a bundt cake that we thought we could bring to the restaurant/table, but to our surprise THIS WAS A NO GO! They said that it was health code and that it could be a possible infraction and what not. I was actually kind of impressed by that. They really do care about the well being of their restaurant and they really stuck to it.     I want to say that the place is SUPER CLEAN. Like my moms house clean lol. I'm a clean freak so this was exactly what I like. Everyone inside seemed to be loving their visit here. We had too many brunch club members with us so they gave us a private dining section outside, which was amazing. It was like a feel good picnic table received just for us. A+++    Our server was so freaking nice, I loved her! I didnt catch her name but Im sure MGMT knows who I'm talking about. We had two little ones with us and they were running a muck and causing havoc but she still kept her cool.     The food came out at a good speed even with the 10 people we had. I had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It was delicious. First I may have thought that there was too much bread (too thick of bread) but when I bit into it I fell into a limbo of cheese butter and bread that someone had to snap me out of it. The tomato soup was good even though I do prefer mine to be a little thicker or heavier. The real highlight of the meal was the Veggie Burger our photographer had. I had a bite of it and thought maybe going Vegan wouldn't be so bad if I came here every morning! Haha!    Overall the place is a success and the food is astonishing by look, and as tasty as it looks. Don't sleep on \"EAT DTLV!\"  - Gabe (@DoYouEvenBrunchLV)",

For my main entry, I had the pancakes, chicken sausage and added two poached eggs. The pancakes were some of the yummiest I've ever had. The chicken sausage went nicely with my medium poached eggs and the service from my waiter was friendly and spot on. Overall satisfied!

    "text": "Best damn breakfast I've had in a while.   There are a LOT of great options in Vegas for a hearty breakfast/brunch, so it's not easy to find a place that really impresses. But Eat managed to serve up some ungodly portions of delicious breakfast food, with a level of quality and execution that was nearly flawless. Let's start with my country fried steak, which was fried to a beautiful crisp, while maintaining a nicely tender center. Matched with chunks of thick gravy and streaks of the runny egg yolk, each bite was beautifully savory and satisfying. The corned beef hash with eggs and toast was equally generous in portion, and came nicely seasoned with an appropriate ratio of potatoes. Each dish was hearty and flavorful, without being overly greasy or heavy.  As equally as impressive as the food, was the organization and execution coming from the kitchen. We sat at the counter and was able to observe how Chef Natalie was constantly hustling and communicating with her staff. They were like a well oiled machine, and it was both impressive and refreshing to see someone that on top of everything coming out of the kitchen. It's no wonder that the food came out promptly, was prepared well, and tasted great.  So if you're looking for a nice little breakfast spot that serves up some creative dishes with quality ingredients and generous portions, come eat at Eat. At the very least, you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that your food was prepared with some attention and care. And that's actually worth something to me.",

The place isn't hard to find, but you do have to get street parking that you'd have to pay for. But, it's all good because once you're done with brunch or what not, you can walk across the street to the Container Park.   We walked and were seated right there and then. I do want to add that this place can getting pretty packed so try to be here early.   I ordered the country fried steak and it was bomb! A little salty but that flavor was so good and the potatoes were cooked to perfection and had a little bit of butter. Also, they can add cheese to your eggs to make it like an omelette mmmmmm! They do have the fried deviled eggs that we ordered but the main dishes were so filling. I will add that the orange juice is freshly squeezed so that will be like a $5-6 drink right there",

I consider all of those things against each other and sometimes they balance each other out. I wanted to like this place more, but it was just a turn off for me.  eat. has been on my radar forever, but they don't fit into my work schedule since they only serve breakfast brunch. It's in a cute space downtown where you'll find a wide variety of patrons.  Our server was so blah. He was super rude when he walked up to us and asked us rather rudely what we wanted. I want to say it was a , \"know what you want?\" No hi or anything. I really hate patronizing places with bad customer service but I whatever, I paid for metered parking. lol jk he also brought us one refill on our drink. When we were paying. Enough about that.  My food was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't drool worthy. It was picture worthy though.  We got the deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, and the Reuben with tomato soup. We got their house brewed citrus tea.  The shrimp and grits was good. The bacon makes the dish. I wish the grits were thicker and more flavorful. It was good and the portion of shrimp was good.  The Reuben sandwich had the thickest slices of bread. The meat was okay. It was all just okay.  The tomato soup was good, but not special. Just a well done basic tomato soup.  The tea was good.  The deviled eggs were good. Deep fried hard boiled egg whites then filled with the traditional deviled egg filling and topped with bacon. I could have eaten a dozen of these.  Overall I liked the place. After hyping myself up for months I'd probably not rush back. The service was disappointing, the food wasn't memorable or special, and the cheap tactics of using the huge bread slices was a turn off.",

First and foremost, if you come on a weekend make sure you allow yourself an extra 20 minutes before you know you'll be hungry. There was only two of us but we were seated within 20 minutes.   The atmosphere is kind of loud so if you're looking for a quite place to relax and have a bite while reading the paper, this isn't the place for you.  The menu is very minimalistic with 5-6 options in the sweet category and the savory category. I went with the truffle egg sandwich. Pretty darn good. The ciabatta was fresh and the smoked bacon that's inside the sandwich was nice and crispy. Potatoes were decent. Not oily and cooked throughout. I should've asked if I could of substituted the potatoes. If you're a homestyle potato person this is totally for you.  Our server Gary was pretty helpful. We told him what we were kind of craving and he pointed us in the right direction. He was very attentive and other servers in the restaurant were very helpful as well.  I'm giving it four stars because overall everything was amazing. A little pricey for what you get but still pretty good.",

    "text": "So turned off by the rude hostess up front.  Yes girl with the dreads and 3 inch holes in your ears, this review is for you!  Came around lunch time and I must say it isn't too crazy busy. Walked in with my coworker and asked for a seat of 5 (lunch time with the office). Was completely ignored. Another group came in seconds right after us, asked for a seat of 5, was immediately seated. Two of my other coworkers came in, asked again for a party of 5.. Again to remind you, there were 4 of us at the time because we were waiting on the doctor to arrive!  We were immediately rejected and told that she cannot seat incomplete parties. WELL DAMN, maybe if you would've said something initially, upon arriving, and actually telling us nicely.. I would've known that information! Word of advice miss, please let \"incomplete parties\" know that such rule before rudely ignoring them and seating the party behind them right away ...  Wooooosah.. Now let's talk food.. New thing tried was the Fried Deviled Eggs - fried egg with a creamy yolk center, topped with hot sauce and bacon pieces! Simple yet yummy! Then got my usual Shrimp & Grits - always a hit!  Service from Gary was great, he has great personality and very tentative!",

    "text": "I visited this little restaurant with my best friend on our way out of Las Vegas on my birthday weekend.   We were greeted and seated promptly. The menu had some super appealing items on it, so it was hard to choose. The service was good although I felt like we were mis-heard on a few occasions, and it's not as though it's terribly loud in there. (I asked for water and said it three times, but he brought me coffee AND orange juice? Not sure how water sounds like coffee or orange juice.)   The decor was modern and cool, as was the staff.  After a lot of inner turmoil, I decided on the two eggs any style with chive potatoes and toast. The potatoes were awesome. The toast was soft and thick, which was nice. My friend had deviled eggs, if I'm not mistaken. She was happy with hers. We shared a large pancake, which both of us thought was just OK--nothing special. But it looked so fluffy!  I think that overall it is worth the price and the experience. The food quality is great, as is the atmosphere. Definitely hit up this place if you're ever in North Vegas.",

    "text": "eat is now a go to place for breakfast for me when I visit Vegas. The food is pretty darn innovative. I mean, who would think to deep fry deviled eggs. Or wrap a soft boiled egg in sausage and deep fry it.   My mom had heard about eat from a TV show she watched. So when we visited a few months ago, we took our first trip to eat. This restaurant is on Carson street right off of Las Vegas Blvd. I remember back in the day, the neighborhood that eat is in wasn't the best, but I noticed that there is a revival going on. Hats off to the people at eat for helping the revival along.   My family and I arrived at eat around 9 a.m. On Friday morning. Just so you know, if you go on a Saturday or Sunday, you are going to have a wait. Up to an hour in most cases so be patient. The menu is small, but mighty.  I would say that the menu is eclectic and foodie friendly.   The star of the menu is the deviled eggs in my view. The hard boiled egg is deep fried, then the yolk mixture is put in the center as usual, but then a little bit of Sriracha is drizzled on top and then to kill it, carmelized onion is added. You get 4 for $8.00. I could eat several plates if they were put in front of me, but you know what happens when you eat too many eggs. Lol For my main dish, I had the Chicken Fried Steak. It was breaded perfectly and had a rich brown gravy on it. It was served with potatoes and eggs cooked to your liking. I suggest over medium. That way, you can cut into the egg and mix it up with the potatoes and a little bit of the steak. My mom had the specs oak of the day, which was a soft boiled egg, wrapped sausage(yes, sausage) then deep fried. It was served with pancakes. It was incredible. My mom loved the pancakes and said they reminded her of my grandma's greasy pancakes. The coffee is really good as well.   The decor is industrial and the restaurant itself isn't very big. The service is good and attentive. Parking is available on the street for $2.00 for an hour. You have to pay at the parking kiosk on the curb. I have never really had trouble finding parking, but I can imagine it can be tough at times.   I feel like eat is very much a local place and not so much a touresty place. At least not yet anyway.",

We kept it simple (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes), which meant we got our food quickly -- very much a plus -- but while the eggs were fresh and hot, the potatoes were obviously reheated from the day before and were soggy with oil. I didn't mind the reuse, but the poor preparation killed what would otherwise have been a tasty side. Our server was friendly and professional; a lot of people came in shortly after we did and she had to hustle to keep up, but she was as attentive as she could have been under the circumstances and we were satisfied with the quality of the service. If I'm back in the downtown area on my next trip, I might give Eat another try, but I'll probably go for a lunch item instead.",

The food tasted good, but the small cubes didn't give me the mouth feel that I prefer, and if you go in thinking you will get the volume of food like Hash-House, you will be disappointed   My friend had the Shrimp and Grits, her comment was that it was some of the loosest grits she has ever had  I might try again on another trip - but I won't go out of my way to do it",

It was my first time having a bene and probably my last. not sure how the sauce is supposed to take but I didnt like it at all. My daughters pancakes were tasty, the bf didnt seem too impressed with his meal. The chive potatoes were good though.

This is how things played out   11:30 am Called to make a reservation for a group of 10 at 1:00 pm. I was told that they don't take reservations but since I called in with enough notice they would work it out for us to be seated.   12:20 pm I arrived early with my husband to the restaurant to put our names on the waiting list. My husband was told \"we will see what we can do\", in regards to seating our group.   12:30 pm I confirmed with the hostess that we would be seated and the owner came by at the same time and said we would be seated at 1:00 pm. (Happy to hear this)  12:50 pm My enter party arrives and three tables are open two right next to each other and one in a separate corner. And the rest of my group arrives  1:00 pm Other people are seated that came in after us.  1:10 pm No updated from the Hostess about us being seated and more people are being seated that arrived after us.   1:15 pm My brother call \"La Comida\" just one block up and one block over from \"EAT\" to see if they can seat us. They said \"Yes!\". I told the hostess we were leaving and we all walked over to \"La Comida\"  Very disappointed on the Customer Services and lack of communication. Granted the location is small but if I was told when I originally called they couldn't seat such a large group we would have never wasted our time waiting.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas we ventured off the strip and into Downtown to try the brunch at this place. We had heard it was a local favorite and the line outside proved that what we were about to experience was good.   The hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait so I asked her if I could have a glass of water. We waited outside and decided to check out the cool container park next door while we waited. When we got back the hostess let us know that she had gotten me my water and I wasn't there! I felt like a jerk but she was very nice about it and didn't make me feel bad about it at all. I appreciate that she went out of her way to get the water for me because at the time 5 other people were barking in her face at the same time. I wish I could bump up the review to 5 stars just because she was so cool about it, but this review has to be about the food.  That isn't to say the food isn't great. We started off with the cinnamon biscuits covered in a strawberry compote and powdered sugar. Eat that! Its fantastic. Your waistline will complain at first but just tell it to hush up because its worth it...  For brunch I had the truffled egg sandwich and my gf had the huevos motulenos. Both were really good. The banana in the huevos motulenos was a little weird at first but after a couple bites the sweetness of the banana balanced the dish well. My egg sandwich was good but kinda plain. It was basically egg, bacon, and mushroom for most of it which isn't a bad thing. I was thinking the whole time eating it that it could use some salt but it wasn't until I got to the end of the sandwich that I got a taste of the feta. That was the tang that really made the sandwich. I guess someone just forgot to put it throughout because that was certainly how the chef intended it to taste.  Pro-tip: The coffee is awesome, nutty, and smooth Super pro-tip for out of towners: The street parking on 7th street is free on sundays yet you will probably not see the one sign that tells you that and pay by accident.  Solid food but not blow me away the best so this gets a solid 4 stars.",

    "text": "The only thing that ruined our experience at 'eat' was the view from my seat of some big guy showing off his hairy ass crack. Along with that view, was a not-so-attractive woman at a different  table showing off her crack too. Despite the horrid visuals around me (and slightly throwing up in my mouth as I saw the dude's ass) the food was great. The BLT was as good as you'll find and the same can be said about the pancakes. With slightly crispy edges and a fluffy texture, it can easily be billed as one of the better pancakes in town. Syrup is available, but isn't needed. The chicken apple sausage on top was great, as well. It wasn't a cheap breakfast, but the quality is well worth it. The brunch menu on weekends is fairly small, much more so than the usual breakfast or lunch menu on weekdays. So, plan your visit accordingly.",

Good coffee and the cinnamon go perfectly with your cup of joe! I had the truffle sandwich which was not too light and not too heavy. My guy had the huevos moltulenos... we swapped forks and we were both torn over who's was better. The moltulenos is an experience. Each bite has a different taste and the bananas hidden under the eggs give you a sweet surprise amongst the Mexican flared beans and chiles. Service is friendly and enthusiastic! If you are a foody and want some peace and good grub in Vegas check out Eat!",

We ordered the cinnamon biscuits and he brought them out first as an appetizer even though we would've much rather had them after our meal, he should've at least asked. Menu is so limited, and I know that it's supposed to be a sort of \"minimalistic style\" type deal, but they close at 2 or 3 AND their menu doesn't give much range. I wish they would give us something to work with. Maybe if the service wasn't so bad I wouldn't mind it as much, but the food wasn't all that great either. Customer service is putting on a show, Gary. Your customers can feel your bad attitude.",

    "text": "Yay! I was so happy to finally get to try this place! I'm so happy to see it doing well! The place was busy last Monday during lunch, full with very little wait. It is a casual breakfast/lunch joint. Breakfast ending at 11am. :( The BF was sad about that, he wanted to try the Chilaquiles. Which I think did say on the printed menu at the restuarant but that's not what we were worrying about at that time...it was what are we going to choose!!   I had the free range chicken sandwich with fresh mozz, tomato and pesto mayo on ciabatta. So yummy!! You can get house made chips or potato salad and 'a really good pickle'. The waitress, who was nice and attentive, asked if I'd rather have the tomato salad, why of courese I want the lighter option!! The tomato salad was good! Cherry tomatoes with fresh sliced garlic, balsamlic dressing, basil...simple and yum! However, I wish it was not served in such a big bowl because it made the portion look super tiny.   The non adventrous food eating BF had eggs, home fries and bacon. You can't go wrong. Their home fires are big pieces where most diners are smaller and end up mushy(but still yummy) I liked the stability of these yummy nuggets!   I also of course love that they serve coffee from my friends at Colorado River Roaster!! SO glad to see more resturants serving their delicious local roasted coffee!  We'll be coming here more often on Lunch Date Mondays, as it is super close to the BF's work! Yay! BF approved!",

It's definitely worth getting up early and getting there before 11am to catch the early morning specials. My usual is the country friend steak. Generous serving for a good price with some great gravy. The pancakes are always super fresh and fluffy too! If you're a sandwich person, I recommend the grilled cheese. Add bacon and avocado for an extra bite. The soup is good and a bit rich. You'll have to unhinge your jaw to bite the super thick cut bread they use on the sandwich though! Hahah. Overall, a really good spot. Sometimes you can catch the owner there! She's doing something great, one shop at a time. Check it out!",

We came in for brunch (10:30ish) and waited for roughly 15 minutes before our waiter came over to take our drink order.  During this time other wait staff glanced in our direction, but didn't take the initiative to assist.  When the waiter finally came, I felt like we were inconveniencing him.  He didn't really speak to us, it was more like a drive through: \"Drinks?\", \"Eat?\", \"That it?\".    In regard to food, it was okay.  I had chilaquiles (being from New Mexico) and was disappointed that the red chile was overpowering the green.  The sausage was also fairly bland.",

    "text": "Vegas has needed a farm to table restaurant like this for quite some time now! Seriously, EAT could be found in the hip downtown epicenter of Austin or Seattle, but instead we are lucky enough to have it right here in downtown Las Vegas. The inside is super cute and small! There is a long communal table in the center, which forces you to interact. I love this! Beware it does get pretty crowded around breakfast and lunch time, OK so it's crowded all of the time, but it is worth it. I have been here a couple of times and my major pain point is that they don't serve breakfast all day, I mean they are only open until 3!   The pancakes are probably some of the best I have ever eaten. They are slightly crispy around the edges and perfectly fluffy in the middle. You didn't even know that you liked your pancakes crispy along the edges, but you do, trust me, you do! The Beignets are absolutely divine. I want to bathe in the vanilla-scented mascarpone, seriously we almost fought over it. The truffled egg sandwich also has so much more flavor than it advertises, super yummy! I tried a bite of my friend's shrimp and grits and the grits were super bland, no butter, no cheese, no salt. That's the only disappointment I have experienced here. If you happen to be here around lunch time the free range chicken sandwich is delicious and it's always a toss-up between their perfectly fried homemade potato chips or their delectable potato salad. You really can't go wrong!",

    "text": "A co-worker told me about eat. being an amazing place for brunch a couple of months ago, so I made it a point to try it out this past winter break.  I came here with my husband at around 11:00 on a weekday and easily found metered street parking.  When we walked it we were greeted warmly by staff and seated within five minutes.  I love the hip atmosphere and decorations.  It was such a fun environment to be in and you could see the owner going around to tables and meeting with customers.   Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs so these three dishes were way too much for us, but Yay for yummy left overs later!  Here is what we ordered:  Chilaquiles scrambled eggs - The sausage on this dish was savory and sweet and amazing.  The sausage was my favorite part of the dish.  The meat was halved and rested on a bead of eggs, cheese, salsa, and chips.  The salsa wasn't my favorite because it was a bit to smokey in flavoring for my taste.  Overall it wasn't a bad dish, but I'll likely explore other things on the menu before in re-order this dish.  Truffled egg sandwich - I can totally see why this dish is so popular on Yelp.  It was amazing!  The eggs, the bacon (and I'm not even a bacon person, the ciabatta bread, and the potatoes.  I highly recommend this for first times to eat.  It will definitely be a great introduction to the food at eat.  Short Stack - The best pancakes I have ever had.  They were super thick and fluffy and mind blowing.  A short stack comes with two 1/2 inch pancakes, topped with lots of powdered sugar, with jarred maple syrup on the side.  If you have a sweet tooth this is a must!!!  When friends and family come and visit in the future, I will definitely bring them here for brunch.",

Expect a wait, because it tends to get really crowded. There's not much shade or seating outside while you wait so beware of the heat during the summer. We were taken here by a LV local, but I dunno if it's really a \"local\" place.  I got the eggs benedict, and wow, I don't know if it's because I was nearing the end of my road trip from San diego to Denver and back again and was eating subway/in&out everyday, but that Benedict just made my DAY. ShOOt. The benedict was topped with a perfect little egg - poached to perfection - covered with hollandaise, under which lay strips of thick turkey bacon, swiss or thick cheese of some sort, tomato, greens, and a nicely toasted piece of bread. The egg had a GREAT ooze to it as you slowly cut into the center of the yoke, adding to the taste and texture. The bacon was so thick i had to chew slower than I wanted to. On the side was a heaping of potatoes, seasoned well.   Definitely a great change from huge and not very good portions served at quick joints on the strip, but super filling! Friends got shrimp and grits, pancakes, country fried steak, all of which no one complained about. I'd come back again!!!",

Even though I really wanted to watch the action I ended up enjoying my view of downtown.  First of all Eat has the friendliest staff! From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out the door everyone was helpful and really nice. The service was spot on. They never let my tasty cup of coffee get empty and even brought me more cream.  It was hard to pick what I wanted from their menu because everything sounded so good! I decided on the corn beef hash. I was glad I did!! It came with chunks of meat and potatoes perfectly cooked with green onions. On top was the best looking two poached eggs I've ever seen! I broke them open and let all the yummy yellow yolkie goodness melt over my hash. It also came with some tasty toast that I could not resist eating one piece of. Definitely was an excellent meal to start the day.  Eat is a little pricey, but for the quality, taste and service it's more then worth it! I'll be back again to try something off their lunch menu! Yay for Eat!",

I loved how some were very dressed up while others were casually brunching. This was my first time and I felt like the other diners were repeat customers for sure.   The decor is Up-Cycle cool and comfortable.  We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, Pancakes, Spicy Egg Dish (sorry I forgot the name), and Chicken Fried Steak.  I can not stop thinking about the Chicken Fried Steak!  It is so perfectly crispy, flavorful, and FRESH! Everything was fantastic. The coffee was so good we had to take a bag home with us.  The Chef and Owner made it a point to check in with us and ensure everything was wonderful.  I don't live in Vegas, but I can not wait to visit EAT again.  A +!",

The exterior isn't the greatest obviously because of it's downtown location, but once you step inside it's like you're in a whole different area.  The restaurant is cute and very well decorated right up my alley.    Once we stepped in we were greeted and seated right away, there were alot of people from law offices and downtown restaurants eating there on their lunch.  I decided to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich although everything sounded really good.  The sandwich consisted of eggs, feta, mushrooms, chives, and bacon on ciabatta bread.  They also served it with a side of Chive potatoe's.  I have a thing about feeling sick after eating too much eggs but I had no problem finishing this sandwich.  I'm very excited that I have found another good spot downtown near my job!  I can't wait to try everything else on the menu.",

Apparently, there were specials, but we never were told them. The menu has a fair amount of options, but still feels rather limited. No alcohol. (Brunch without a mimosa??!) Our dishes were tasty and very filling. (We both took home half of what we ordered.) But the dishes also weren't crazy good or unique. And for the price, it felt a bit like a let down. All in all, I wouldn't be opposed to coming again. And maybe ordering something different would make it better. It ain't bad.",

    "text": "EAT. serves delicious, healthy-ish food in a small cafe in Old Vegas; don't expect EAT. to be Applebee's or a buffet.  I went to EAT. quite some time ago. It was the best food I had eaten while I was in Vegas for a business trip (week-long). I wish I had been there sooner. I heard about it from Anthony Bourdain's show and how he raved about Natalie Young's talents as a young up-and-coming chef.   The menu is smallish, but what EAT. does make is delicious, quality food (over quantity). Anyone who has been to an upscale restaurant or a specialty restaurant recognizes right away a smaller menu means the chef has chosen meals with the finer ingredients and has a technique that surpasses that of a larger menu.  Their portion-size actually is quite large. But...this is the U.S. and Vegas (if you're a mainstream tourist you expect a certain variety and type of food).  Also, it's a small cafe and not a huge banquet room restaurant. Complaining about a party of 11-people is ridiculous.  I was actually at the end of a vicious cold when I was in Vegas, and the food there was healthy-ish and also delicious. (Take note of the veggie burger but also the gourmet meat selection.)  I even took a meal with me for the plane because it was that good.   Also, a side note is the area around EAT. should be explored. It's in OLD VEGAS meaning it's the historical sites for the BRAT PACK (original one with Sinatra Sammy D. Jr.) and many films classic film fans might recognize! I enjoyed being away from the crowd, and being able to walk without smoke being blown in my face. There are also many grassroots efforts in the area as art galleries. I even walked by the PAWN STARS pawn shop on my way back to my hotel (that is in the main \"new\" strip of Vegas).   ENJOY!!! Also, I highly doubt there was a hair on the plate and the waitress ignored that one writer. More likely the writer was disgruntled from something about the food/restaurant and then plucked out the hair and wrote a crappy review.    Most Americans consume food seasoned with salt (in many cases MSG for pre-made sauces and fast food), and sugar. EAT. makes their food fresh and from scratch which also makes some of these comments moot points for me. For example, see the review on a critique of a Hollandaise sauce and bacon. Likely these \"bold flavors\" she describes comes out of a package not fresh cream or real bacon (that hasn't been treated with a ton of nitrates). And also, the comment about the \"banana\" on the bottom of \"Mexican food goodness\"--likely this writer mistook a different Latin-American inspired dish (perhaps from El Salvador where the cuisine uses plantains) for Mexican food. Because, duh, all Americans know Mexican food, but not much else in terms of different Latin-American national foods.  If she would have tasted the said \"banana\" she might have discovered it was delicious! (And discovered a new national cuisine). Many of these bad reviews are proof there's not a lot of food in our food anymore. I suspect, some of these readers don't recognize (or don't have a palate for) real food anymore. In short, take some of these reviews with a grain of salt and look at their website or listen to Bourdain's review.",

    "text": "Came to try this place out after reading good yelp reviews during our visit to Las Vegas. We came from San Diego for a family trip.   Service: This is where they lost 2 stars. Very first strike was when we arrived and asked for a table for 5 adults and 1 WHEELCHAIR. The hostess at the front responded \"Why don't you put her in a high chair??\" Are you freakin kidding me?! Our response: \"You're going to put my grandmother in a high chair??!\" She apologized and said she was thinking we brought a child. Regardless if it is a child or adult, if we ask for ADA compliance, that's what we should get. She was insensitive and her comment made her seem like a complete idiot. Here is some advice for that hostess: Listen to UNDERSTAND, not listen to respond. Maybe you wouldn't come off as so incompetent. I really wish I got her name. Second strike was our server, Gary. Granted, we are a large party (6 people) and it was a busy morning. But we would appreciate if you don't come up to us and talk to us like we didn't know English. There's a difference between talking clearly and concise and talking like an asshole. Learn the difference.   Honestly, all the OTHER servicers, expediters, and bussers were extremely polite and friendly. They worked quickly and were very attentive. Just a couple rotten apples in the batch.   Location: Easy to find with GPS and the large sign out front makes it easy to spot. Right across the street from the Las Vegas Container Park. Near Fremont Street.  Parking: Street parking. $2 per hour, plan accordingly. Good thing is they do it in 30 minute increments.   Wait: We were quoted 15 minutes upon checking in and waited about 30 minutes. But they have a larger waiting area inside and a bench outside.   Food: Food was exceptional. We waited probably only 10 minutes for our food to be brought out. Our food was cooked really well and nothing was missing from our order. Coffee is good and a good portion. Our food portions were large but not obnoxiously large.",

The restaurant and its location are both interestingly quirky. The interior and ambience of the restaurant felt fun and inviting. It just feels like a cool place to go have a meal.  The server was friendly and quick. There was a good variety of dishes to choose from. We ordered some coffees, beignets, oatmeal and some pancakes with sausage.   The coffee was delicious. There wasn't a trace of bitterness in the coffee. The rest of the food was very good as well. It tasted fresh and well made.  All in all a delightful place to have a meal. I would definitely go again to try out the other dishes.",

    "text": "Decided to come here for brunch after reading the reviews. Located in a up-and-coming \"hipster\" neighborhood in downtown LV.  We arrived around 10am and there was no wait. The prices are fair compared to other brunch restaurants on the strip. The service was friendly.  We ordered the deviled eggs - Deviled eggs with a breakfast twist. These were very good. There's a light batter coated around the egg, which provides a nice crunch. The bacon is also a nice touch. Has a breakfast-y feel for deviled eggs.  Country fried chicken with potatoes - Looked and smelled amazing. However, the chicken steak, I felt, was under seasoned. The gravy was also under seasoned. I wish I had ordered the shrimp and grits instead.   Reasonably priced brunch spot in downtown LV. 4 stars for the deviled eggs and 3 stars for the country fried steak.",

The potatoes had a nice crunch to them. My husband had the chilaquiles and they were also delicious! I never chilaquiles with actual \"chips\" (they're usually served with soft tortillas) but they were still amazing! The food was amazing! However, The service was TERRIBLE! Again, it was a Tuesday afternoon and they had plenty of open tables. I waited 5 min before someone acknowledged me and my party walked in. After we were seated, we waited almost 10 min before a serve even acknowledged us and took our drink menu. They was one other table that was sat after my party and their order was taken before mine. During this wait, we had time to look over our menu, and knew what we want d to order by the time they came to get our drink orders. I said to the waitress \"were ready to order\" and she said she'll be back to take our food order but walked over and took an order for an other table that had just arrived. If the service could match the food, they would be a solid 5 stars.",

    "text": "Among the buffets and restaurants that serve up greasy (delicious) foods in Downtown, there is Eat: a new restaurant serving up tasty, healthy meals to help jump start your day or revive you from the morning grind at mid-day.   RESTAURANT Located a few blocks away from the Fremont Street Experience, Eat is located on Carson Street. Inside you'll notice the urban-industrial decor and potted greenery, which is always nice to see especially if you're so used to seeing brown dirt all the time. The floors are concrete and the ceiling has an unfinished appearance with its exposed pipes. I mention this because the restaurant was very noisy when I visited, so the sound was bouncing off the floor and ceiling.  FOOD Free Range Chicken Cibatta Sandwich: Does free range chicken taste better than ones that are pumped up with steroids? I can't say for sure, but I guess I feel less guilty.  The sandwich was delicious with its melted mozzarella cheese, pesto mayo, and mixed greens.   The sandwich can be paired with your choice of homemade potato chips or potato salad. You'll also receive  a \"really good pickle\", as stated on the menu. The potato chips were crunchy and not greasy. Both my friend and I didn't receive pickles with our meals since they were all out of them. Unfortunate since we were really looking forward to trying this supposed, \"really good pickle\" which I imagine would complement our sandwiches.   SERVICE Even though it was busy when my friend and I arrived, the service didn't disappoint. We received our orders fairly quickly, and if we needed anything our waiter wasn't too far from our table.   TIPS + Seems like this place can get packed during lunchtime hours, so it might be best heading down here right when lunch is being served at 11:00 a.m.  +There's meter parking across the street from the restaurant, although you could just park at one of the nearby casino parking garages.   OVERALL I think Eat is on to something here with its fresh, delicious, healthy food that leaves you feeling good without any of the, \"I hate my life! I shouldn't have eaten that\" regrets.",

    "text": "Over 1000 reviews with an average of 4 stars?! Is it worth the hype? Yes, for the most part, it is. I'm going to spare you the details since so many people have reviewed it already so a couple of key notes:  -parking IS hard to find. We came on Sunday around 11AM and all street parking was full. We lucked out to one last empty spot. Also, you don't have to feed the meters on the weekends so that was a plus.  -Expect to wait for a table. The restaurant is small and constantly busy so don't come here hangry. We were quoted 15-20 minutes for a party of 2 but only had to wait about 5.  -The cinnamon biscuits were hyped up the way it should be. It was delicious!!!! I'm not normally a sweets kinda gal for breakfast items but wow....the strawberry syrup along with sliced strawberries and whole blueberries were yummy. This plate came with four small sized cinnamon biscuits...which to me, looked like pancakes.  -Boyfriend got the country fried steak with scrambled eggs and chives potatoes. He really enjoyed it. We both agreed we made the right choice with what we ordered and would definitely order it again.  Only reason why I knocked off one star was the bathroom situation. ONLY ONE BATHROOM EACH for men and women. One bathroom!? Are you kidding me? Is this a gas station? I'm sorry, I understand it's in downtown LV and there's always homeless and drunk tourists roaming around asking for bathrooms left and right but damn....the least you can do is supply two bathrooms each for us! Of the 45 minutes we were there, both times I tried going to the bathroom and there was always someone in there. Thank goodness I didn't need to take a number 2!  At one point, there were 4 men waiting to use the restroom. When there's a line for the men's bathroom....it's time to do something about it. So don't come eat here if you're hungover (because you'll either be peeing all morning or hugging the toilet bowl) or if you drank a lot of mimosas/coffee. You might have to empty your bladder at one of the downtown casinos cuz there's no room for you here to do just that!",

It seems like that is the biggest breakfast and just what I needed: a massive piece of chicken fried steak with sausage gravy dumped on top, plus some eggs, plus some potatoes, plus some mongo thick sourdough toast! Awesome!   My frau got the truffled egg sandwich and I had a bite of that - delicious! We went on a Saturday around noonish with a party of four and were seated in about 10 minutes.

    "text": "As I was leaving my hotel this morning, I asked the valet where he would go to breakfast if he didn't want to go to a casino buffet. Without hesitation he said, \"Dude, you have to go downtown and try this place called Eat. I've only been there once, but it was one of the best breakfast I ever had.\" Well who was I to argue with the hotel valet, so I jumped in the car and headed right over there for breakfast.  I will say this, it's located in a sort of seedy part of town, but you shouldn't let that stop you. There is no free parking, but they do have pay per space on the street, and it only cost me a buck, so no harm or foul there.  The restaurant itself has a really cool, casual, hip vibe to it. Almost like one of those little boutique coffee shops. The staff was all very friendly, and eager to make suggestions. I started out with a cup of coffee, which was really amazing. I mean I didn't ask where the coffee came from, but I'm pretty sure it was some Latin dude with a burro bringing the beans in fresh.  I usually try to get a combo plate to get a feel for the restaurant, but the combo plate that they had didn't have any sort of pancakes with it, so I asked the waiter what I should get. He recommended getting the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote if I was looking for something sweet and yummy. And of course, my usual glass of milk to test the serving skills of the staff.   Those biscuits? Oh my God, he was absolutely right! These amazing fresh hot little cinnamon biscuits smothered in strawberry compote with fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries, tasted like they were delivered Straight from Heaven itself!  The food was delivered to my table,  buy another one of the servers. And there was no milk. Two seconds later,  my original server shows up with my glass of milk. And there was no milk. Two seconds later, my original server shows up with my glass of milk. Another amazing save by the wait staff!   The eggs were really good, scrambled just the way I like them, their home style hash browns were really tasty and spiced well, but the real star of this plate was the Applewood smoked bacon. Like I mean this stuff tasted like it just came out of the smoker this morning. I would have seriously ordered three more plates of it, but I didn't want to look like a total hog.  The bottom line? Awesome food, great atmosphere, so really, what's not to love? It's a really great place.",

    "text": "After seeing how many reviews this place  got, I thought \"I had to try this place\". After seeing the reviews we decided to try this place on a Monday morning for breakfast to avoid the crowds and long waits.  When we (7 adults, 3 kids and a baby) checked in for a table the people weren't friendly at all. No smiles, just a \"How many you got\" with a stone face.   We get to the table, we're short a seat, and when we asked to add a small table, the guy seemed irked that he had to adjust the table because someone set it wrong. Even when the server arrived to get our order he didn't even crack a smile or from. Another stone face no expression person.   We ordered the cinnamon biscuits, which was a HUGE mistake! It was so dry (yes, I know biscuits are suppose to be dry, but this was like, extra dry, gotta drink water sort of dry) and that gross thick strawberry cough syrup tasting nasty sauce was straight up disgusting! A short stack (2 pancakes), which was just OK. Corned beef hash which came with 2 poached eggs. When I thought of corned beef hash, I thought more of a hash patty type of hash, but it was the type of hash with the tiny cubed potatoes with the tiny cubed pieces of corned beef. We also ordered some Mexican breakfast thing which had a banana under all that Mexican yumminess. Eewww! Wth! So fricken gross! Mexican food with a banana in it! Who's stupid idea was that!?  Anyways, long story short, I would never recommend this place or ever go back again!",

    "text": "When this restaurant was first opened, their sandwiches were really good and the place was always packed.  Past forward to present day. I visited this place recently when I took an out of town vendor to visit this joint because he wanted a good sandwich. Anyway, we went during peak lunch hour and I was nervous about the long wait, but when I got to the joint, we didn't have to wait at all. That should have been a sign.  Anyway, I ordered the BBLT sandwich and he ordered something else. For a place that wasn't that busy, it took a long time for the sandwiches to come out. When I took a few bites, I realized the quality really went down hill from the time it first opened. The other guy wasn't impressed with the sandwich either.   Now here is the main reason why I will never come back to this joint beside the mediocre sandwich. A few days before this visit, I received a new credit card with new numbers on it and I used it only at a few places (markets and gas stations) and the credit card was never out of my sight and hand. By the way, I always checked for skimming devices at the gas stations. The only transaction where the credit card was out of my sight was at this restaurant and I started getting fraudulent charges on this card about two weeks after my visit. Now I'm not and won't directly accuse someone at this restaurant of skimming my credit card numbers, because I don't have any proof. But knowing that this was the only place that my credit card (with new numbers) was taken out of my sight made me nervous of potential credit card theft.",

It's about a 10-15 minute walk from Fremont Street. I am going to tell you now, even if it was a one hour walk to get there, the food is worth it. We went about brunch time  and were seated almost immediately by very friendly staff. I chose the corn beef hash, my wife the truffled egg sandwich, and la kat's deviled eggs to share. OMG! The deviled eggs are absolutely scrumptious and worth the visit alone. The portions are huge and either the egg sandwich or corn beef hash could easily feed two for a light meal. I thought the corn beef hash was very good, very fresh tasting but I ended up being envious of my wife's truffled egg sandwich. The tastes and flavors of our food was just amazing. I cannot write any faults for this restaurant as the food was great and the staff was awesome. E.A.T is a must go restaurant and I would highly recommend it.

Praise and love for the Eat Team who transformed the prosaic spot beneath an apartment complex into a great breakfast and lunch joint. Although, parking is limited and you have to pay via meter. So, I just ended up parking for free at the nearby El Cortez.  Think of it as a way to burn those calories post-meal.  Before my friend and I even stepped inside, the hostess opened the door with a smile and a cheery welcome. The place was loud and busy; luckily for us, there was one table available. The decor was tastefully done with some nice touches; for example, I love the \"I'll See You in the Flowers\" art piece on the wall.  The lunch menu is focused, unintimidating, and conventional: sandwiches, salads, and soups. The free range chicken sandwich with chips was delicious, moist, and slathered in pesto. Just the way I wanted it. The chips were crisp and seasoned well, but unmemorable. I wish they had seasoned fries or a side salad option. To most people, this will sound blasphemous, but one annoyance was the untrimmed fat on the chicken (personal preference). As for my friend, he happily inhaled his DWBLT and gave it two greasy thumbs up. Throughout the meal, our server beatifically refilled our waters and checked-in on us, while juggling his tables. While the food is not groundbreaking, Eat serves up good classics dishes while improving downtown's reputation.",

    "text": "So many choices downtown these days... 3 1/2 stars  We were looking for lunch around 11:30 on a Friday afternoon. We ran into a wait time at a few places, then sought out eat. We had to wait 20 minutes here too. Apparently unavoidable. It was bustling inside and noisy. It's a cute place with an industrial vibe.   The service lacked any sincerity. We got everything we needed but there was no explanation of the menu of suggestions or conversation at all.   The menu had a grilled cheese with tomato soup. I asked to substitute the green chicken chile pozole instead.   She said that would be A-OK for a $1 up charge. She also offered avocado and bacon on my sandwich. Of course! By no means did I expect this to be a free addition; however, it turned out to be a $6 charge which made my grilled cheese and soup somewhere in the neighborhood of $16. Yowsa. It was delightful. The sourdough bread was giant, no less than 1\" thick for each slice. It was soaked 3/4 of the way through with butter. The sandwich was crispy, chewy, yummy and decadent. The pozole was spicy, and very flavorful. Loads of veggies and shredded chicken. Very good. I shared it with my little guy and still had leftovers to take home. It was a generous portion.   My compadres enjoyed their arugula salad and chicken sandwich very much. We all drank water. The bill was $45 for 2 sandwiches and a salad. So $18 each for lunch. I guess not bad. Gotta pay the price to hang with the in crowd!   I would certainly return for more delicious food. Many of the brunch menu items sounded intriguing. Expect busy, noisy and delicious!",

    "text": "We were in Vegas to visit my brother and he brought us here. Said it was one of his favorite spots for breakfast. We went at lunch time and had a bit of a wait but there were 6 of us.  The place is small but very cool. The outdoor patio looked like you were sitting in a friend's backyard, very cozy and cute.  Everything on the menu sounded amazing and 4 of us zeroed in the same thing...the killer grilled cheese with kick ass tomato soup. The other 2 in our party ordered regular breakfast of eggs, bacon and home fries - which were delicious, they call them chive potatoes and the huge chunks of potatoes were seasoned perfectly!  Back to the grilled cheese and soup...the sandwich was made on thick sourdough bread with a couple of different gooey cheeses, the tomato soup was good but kind of too garlicky. Overall awesome combo!  Cool place, great food!",

Street parking at $1 for 30 minutes. Overall safety of the area a little bit questionable especially at night.  I feel like we only got seated sooner than 42 minutes because we pretty much complained. We did get a free strawberry biscuit thing, but I am almost sure it had high fructose corn syrup. Was expecting better quality but hey free $8 dish for our wait.  I looked at the menu and also didn't seem to have many healthy choices. Felt like a slight increase in quality than your neighborhood corporation breakfast restaurant. Had a water that was a bit unusual. I had to take a look at it and realize there was lemon in it, but didn't seem to match with my brain (like artificial flavor). I had a BLT sandwich and wife had truffle sandwich. We both thought the dishes were not anything to be worth the hype. A feeling like like I could cook it. Potato chips were good, not out of this world.  Service was awesome though. I just didn't feel like I would ever come back considering popularity and what I'm looking for in quality and value. If you have a big stomach, the portions would work well for one dish. Also, does not seem like a good place for kids (infants I should say - a bit cramped and your wait time will increase).",

So I ended up wanting to try something I haven't had and went with the truffle egg sandwich on a long ciabatta bun. It consists of 2 scrambled eggs (cooked perfectly), bacon, wild mushrooms, feta cheese, green onions and a side of thick crisp country style potatoes. This thing was bigger than I was expecting and those potatoes were cooked far better than I thought they would be being they were so thick. Bravo   although I didn't taste much truffle.       The restaurant was clean with a bit of an industrial/hip vibe. Good service and priced accordingly for that imo. I'm satisfied over all and may return again to try that chicken fried steak.",

Since our last visit, the Downtown Container Park opened which I'm sure is a big draw for the downtown neighborhood.  We readily found street parking out front and were seated relatively quickly.   We ordered the chicken mozzerella sandwich with kick ass tomato soup, the golden brown pancakes, and the two eggs any style.  The foundation of our meal was the two eggs, a standard breakfast every spot should have.  Our scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, while not memorable, were well prepared.  The other dishes really took center stage.  The golden brown pancakes had this really crazy crust, like they hard seared the pancake on a very hot griddle and the insides were fluffy.  The texture was awesome.  The sweet chicken sausage wasn't my fav but they again did a nice hard sear on the flattop.   From the lunch side of the menu, the chicken mozzerella sandwich had fluffy bread, juicy chicken and textbook perfect tomato soup.    I like that Eat.'s menu changes (it was not the same as when we last visited) and that they mix classic with new and interesting dishes.  Most importantly, everything tastes great.",

This visit was better than the last but didn't leave me wowed.    We arrived and were ready to order as we had looked online at the menu.  We wanted chicken fried steak and chilaquiles.  Apparently even though they are under the \"All Day Egg's\" section of the menu they are not served all day.  We had missed the cut off by a few minutes.  Our server seemed annoyed when we needed a few minutes to decide on something else.  We ended up with deviled eggs, shrimp & grits and corned beef hash.  Food was OK.  Shrimp and grits are my favorite meal but this version doesn't do it for me.  It is also what I had on my first visit which is why I wanted to try something else.  Oh well maybe in another 5 years.    No boozy brunch here.  Not even a mimosa.",

Street parking is available but I believe most of it is metered parking so be prepared to pay a few bucks.  If you are staying at a nearby hotel that is also fine as well.  During the daytime the walk here isn't too bad.  I've been a few times and it usually starts getting busy after 7:30-8:00 AM on both the weekdays and weekends.    My most recent trip's meal  Corned Beef Hash (4.5/5) - A cut sausage and diced potato hash - I think corned beef is supposed to be more soft? (If I'm wrong please correct me!) I like the poached eggs and the thick cut piece of sourdough that they serve with it.  My preference in corned beef hash is the softer meat but this was extremely delicious as well!  One Golden Brown Pancake (5/5) - AMAZING PANCAKE.  Best pancake I think in Las Vegas although some would argue other places have the best pancake.  It is a thick pancake with the flat sides being slightly crispy.  They serve the maple syrup in a cute little mason jar with a halved strawberry.  Great decor, good food!  Please be prepared to wait 30+ minutes if you come during the busy hours.",

    "text": "Just a few weeks before my trip to Vegas, I had asked my coworkers what I should do in Vegas. Before answering my questions, they asked me what I want to do and all I said was eat.  My boss had suggested I go to a place called Eat. Lol. Owned by a WOC, he said that the menu was DELICIOUS. I'll be guilty and admit that I didn't do much research, none the less look it up on Yelp. But sure thing, it's got great reviews! Lol Thanks Neal.  Parking was surprisingly easy. There's a bunch of paid parking lots right on the side of the street next to the Container Park. $2.00/hour, card only.  I was warned to go there at about 8:30 a.m. or at least when they open because it gets packed. Luckily on a Monday (Christmas Eve) we were able to get one of the last tables. Everyone was wearing a Christmas sweater and the restaurant, in addition to its hipster finesse, was decked out in Christmas gear. It may not mean a lot to other people, but it meant a lot to me. It just adds to the magic of Christmas!  Anyway, let's get into it. Here's what we ordered: La'Kat's deviled eggs that makes giraffes dance. lol - I remember my boss telling me it was one of his favorites so i decided to get it. It comes in four and is definitely a favorite of mine. I've never had deviled eggs battered, and fried. It was DELICIOUS. The waiter also came with some hot sauce and we spotted some Cholula. BAM. Yum.  Corned Beef Hash - Not your typical canned corned beef hash like some locals from Hawaii are used to. It's cubed with potatoes and onions and topped with poached eggs. Served with sourdough bread, crisp and soft and wonderful. I was picturing something like an eggs benedict but but love that i was able to mix it all together and have the bread dip in the yolk. Oh. Man.  Shrimp & Grits - Grits with two fried eggs, salsa, shrimp and two pieces of sliced bacon. It could've done without the salsa.  We though cheese could have been a better topping. Maybe bits of crispy bacon.  Altogether spent about $50 for two people. Not bad. Definitely one for the hipsters. LOL",

The bread was drenched in butter, which is delicious there wasn't any additives that I needed. Additionally, my mom had the Shrimp & Grits. She wasn't too pleased with her order because she felt as if it felt more as a porridge, but overall quality was great.  The ginger drink is absolutely refreshing, you can taste more of the ginger when you're almost finished with it (really opened my sinuses).",

    "text": "We stopped by here for brunch on our roadtrip to Utah. I was looking for a brunch place that was off the strip so that we didn't have to pay a expensive parking fee/fight traffic and found this place in Old Town Las Vegas. Parking is on the street, remember to pay at the parking machine so you don't get a parking ticket. Parking was only $3.00 for 1.5 hours if I remember correctly.  It was still relatively empty when we came at 11AM, albeit got busy once we finished ordering. I went with their vegan dish of tofu scramble that came with roasted potatoes  and bread on the side. I added in an order of scrambled eggs since I opted out of bread and was afraid I might get hungry fast with the tofu dish. The dish was actually really tasty, I'm always a fan when someone can make a yummy vegan dish without emphasizing how bland tofu can be (don't get my wrong, I love tofu, I eat that sh*t right out of the box LOL). Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive, made sure our water was filled and that we got everything we needed.  They also have a cute patio area, I'd try and sit there the next time I'm here (it was too hot the day we came so we sat inside). Would definitely come again!",

When we arrived I was unsure of the place but also thought this might be a little gem and by the reviews I had to try it.  We order pancakes, chicken fried steak, truffled egg sandwich and many other items. All I can say is I am the hero for finding this place.   I, myself ordered the Truffled Breakfast Sandwich, my gosh, this had to be the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had and then it came with unbelievable breakfast potatoes. The tomato soup and sandwich my other half ordered was AMAZING, the pancakes came out and were so fluffy and huge that I don't think anyone finished them at the table.....I only have one complaint and that is after eating all that food we were too lazy to do anything the rest of the day. I can't wait until Sept. when I am back in town as I will be here again. Awesome job you guys on a great place to eat! If your looking for a nice little place away from the strip go to/and EAT!",

The basics of the dish resemble the common huevos rancheros but with the addition of peas. But there were two sauces, one red and one green, both tasting like they were fresh and homemade. The potatoes accompanying the dish also tasted freshly made. In general it was just a delicious item, and at $20 with tip included, not unreasonably priced (considering the quality). Misc: It took a minute or two for someone to get me seated. No big deal but I wish they'd been a bit more attentive. I grabbed a seat at the counter; not too many tables were available.  This is close to a derelict, half-torn-down building, but I don't think the locality feels particularly shady, unlike some other parts of downtown.",

Straight up, rude, maybe hates Asians who knows!--I know it's ridiculous to think this way--but I'm not sure why she was such a B towards my sister and I this morning.  It got to the point that we left the place w/o finishing the food because I couldn't handle the vibe.  I was watching her serving 2 tables next to us.  She was relatively nice.  Then why to us?  We were very polite to her and asked a few questions because we didn't know the little jar she delivered with coffee, looked like a small \"jam\" container btw, was the syrup for our one of the orders--pancakes.  She cut us short and delivered this attitude-- Right. There.  I had to apologize, oh sorry, I didn't know.. A few more episodes, but I guess I don't have to list them all because I'm sure you've got the point.  I paid money this morning to have such nasty experience.  Oh! Btw- our orange juice order was dismissed, and she never apologized to us that she didn't provide that to us.   She didn't check on us; I asked for my check to Christopher who was another server passing by, he was very very nice and gave us our check and a to-go box.   If my whole experience this morning was with Christoper, I might be giving a 5 star review here.  Shame.  However, service is a significant part of up-and-coming restaurant's winning point.  People, all in all, I moved into near by high rise condo last year and pretty much tried ALL the restaurants in DTLV.  Recommend trying this place once unless the server is Rachel.  Me, personally, because of today, I will not return.  We have PublicUS, Vesta and Makers & Finder!!!  Why would I deal w/ BS again?  Neh.... :)",

Instead, they are plain buttermilk serviced with butter and actual maple syrup. Despite having an extreme sweet tooth, these pancakes are THE VERY BEST I've ever had - a little buttery and crisp on the outside (just enough), and fluffy deliciousness on the inside. I realize this review has turned into an ode to pancakes, but they deserve it!   If I'm being at all critical, I must point out that there is almost always a wait to eat at Eat. However, it is run well and you can tell this is usually based upon demand and not poor management.   In sum, I'm a local and enjoy Eat every time I go. Highly recommended!!!   (The grilled cheese with tomato soup is also quite epic - great lunch choice; the veggie chili is hearty and flavorful, both healthy and filling, but probably not for those meat eaters who will likely miss the meat - I loved it, but am a vegi so take that as you will)",

I ordered the Huevos Motulenos, which is a traditional Mexican dish from the Yucatan peninsula. The sauces were delicious, as were their avocado (extra), and the potatoes on the side. The bananas were the black sheep of my plate (I expected them to be fried like \"platanos fritos\", but you only notice they're regular bananas if you're an obnoxious Mexican customer who knows real Mexican food). I am giving a four stars, because I don't know at what point our waiter decided he hated my guts. I loved that he offered to add avocado to my dish, and I love that he gave me some sass on the side too. I'm down for that kind of attitude in a chill vibe like the one you breathe at this place. At the end however, he decided to sigh at my request to split the check. That's the kind of sass I don't need with my brunch. I will come back, because the tomato basil soup my friend ordered was as amazing as my huevos. I think this place is amazing, quaint, and unique. I just hope I don't get more sass for dessert upon my return.",

The fried chicken in gravy with over easy eggs, and a stack of pancakes to share with my friends.. The presentation was beautiful, the food perfect, and the drinks plentiful.

Far removed from the Food network portraitures and triple digit price points of your typical strip-side steakhouse, tapas bar or italian eatery this down to earth downtown cafe is a refreshing change of pace for the adventurous LV visitor.    The menu offers some familiar treats done right and some not so familiar items for the more daring of palettes.  Firstly, the pancakes were praised by everyone at my table for their perfectly crispy edges.  The beignets were warm and soft, as fresh as any Bourbon street bakery, and served with sweet homemade jam and mascarpone.  My dish, the Huevos Motulenos, was an inspired new take on the classic huevos rancheros, with the addition of banana (a subtle addition mind you) making this one of the more memorable and unique breakfast dishes I've had the pleasure to try.  Natalie, the chef and owner of eat., was in the kitchen for most of our visit cranking away on orders and running the staff but we had the pleasure of catching her taking a much deserved break on the bench out front on our way out.  She was happy to chat with us for a bit and I'm happy to say embrace us with as much warmth and authenticity as her menu exemplifies.    I look forward to any future endeavors Natalie brings to this lonelier Las Vegas neighborhood and hope to return to eat. in the future for more tasty culinary delights.  Thanks again, Natalie!",

Upon my first visit, I had a waitress recommend the pancake - she said it would change my life.  She was right.  It's a sweet (but not too sweet), fluffy pancake with a nice buttery crisp to the outside.  I'm not sure what they put in it to give it a creamy flavor but omg I wake up thinking about going to get one often.  The potatoes (so yummy), eggs, bacon, toast & everything else I've ordered is always fresh & cooked correctly.  I've also tried their cinnamon biscuits with the berry compote - freaking brilliant.  The waiters/waitresses are always so nice & accommodating.  Do yourself a favor & get yourself over there for breakfast/brunch/lunch soon!",

The diner seemed a bit \"hipstery\" but I didn't mind too much.  My Cousin and I had the country fried steak and eggs.  I had bacon and he had the apple sausage on the side.  And WOW!!!! This place is seriously delicious. Everything was cooked exactly as ordered, and the service was great  too.    The coffee was a bit on the normal side, but at least it wasn't horrible.  All in all this place deserves a 5 star rating and I will definitely come back if I stay in the area again.",

    "text": "EAT your heart out downtown! 5 Stars on my first visit because they are doin it and doin it and doin it well here.  I went on a weekday at 12:30 for lunch. Place was packed and I'm thinking I will never get in. The hostess said the wait time was ten minutes and I still thought yeah right. She is just saying that so I don't leave. NOPE. I was seated in less than ten minutes. Awesome.  Instantly I am greeted with menus and our drink order was taken. As a foodie I had only been studying the menu online for weeks now so now I play the game pretending to read the menu and waiting for my friend to decide. It was hard to decide because truthfully I wanted to try like five things. I settled on the grilled cheese and chips.   GRUB: Grilled Cheese. Cheesy, buttery, crunchy heaven. It's on thick sourdough bread and served with a delicious, intense tomato soup. Dip that shit and find an instant happy place. Suddenly the restaurant didn't seem so noisy. The food was THAT good. My friend also enjoyed her grilled cheese just as much. We also ordered a side of homemade chips which were perfectly seasoned and crisp. Good stuff.   On top of the killer food they also played some of my favorite music: The Killers, Xx, Vampire Weekend and Morrissey. I loved everything about this experience.  The only negatives I could see people having would be that it is very busy and gets VERY loud. It would be the perfect spot to fire or breakup with someone. Parking sucks orangutan taint, too. Mostly metered parking around, but I did find a side street with no meters. I am not use to carrying change around. This isn't LA, fools.  Overall I am in love with EAT. I feel like it was made just for me. I hope it succeeds and attracts more businesses just like it. More reason for all of us to kick it downtown.",

My sister and I tried eat last summer when we were staying downtown. I remember it being a great breakfast with delicious coffee and friendly, hip servers. I suggested eat to my husband during our most recent Vegas trip. We had our dogs so I called to see if they were allowed on the patio. The person on the phone said the patio was closed due to cold weather, but she could accommodate us.  When  we got there, the hostess directed us the the patio doors and a staff member seated us. It was a little chilly, but the wonderful coffee kept us warm while our small dogs snuggled in our laps.  My husband tried the same dish that my sister had loved on my last visit, the shrimp and grits. He loved it too. I tried the huevos montulenos. Previously, I had the eggs bene with avocado subbed for the meat. The hollandaise was excellent, but I wanted to try something new. I really liked the dish except the sweet bananas were a little weird. If they replaced them with plantains, the dish would be a knockout.",

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was okay. The portion was gigantic, but for taste I would give it a 2.5/5 because the grilled cheese was very oily and greasy and the tomato soup was sour. I added some cream to it and it was a whole lot better.   During my experience there, the service was not the best. The waiters/ waitresses seemed inexperienced and were not communicating well with us. When we came in to get seated, the hostess led us half way and we were confused on which table to sit at until I asked her and she was like, \"Oh, yeah. This is your table.\" Then the waiter came  and I asked for water and he just put up 2 fingers instead of asking if I wanted two waters for my mom. Throughout our meal, he had the attitude of \"I'm so done with working.\" Later he went to the other waiters to talk and mingle and completely forgot about us but one of the younger waiters came to us and got us our check and to go boxes (only nice thing about our experienced).   Not sure if I would come back.",

It was good but not great. Some of the food was interesting and different, but overall it lacked flavor and seasoning.  We had the shrimp and grits: bland. The shrimp were way over cooked and tough. The grits were soupy and not much flavor. The bacon was a limp Mess and it was on the bottom of the plate and would have been better chopped up on top IMO.   The egg and black bean tostada: just ok. Would not order it again. Large portion for sure, but bland. A bit soupy.   The side of smoked bacon was very good. Thick but and not too crisp.   The English muffin was nice, but a bit bland. It was made from scratch which was nice. It just needed some more salt in the dough.   The country fried steak: really wanted this to be good but the meat was just too tough. It needs to be tenderized more and maybe a tad thinner. It had a great crisp breading, but just was like shoe leather in the mouth. Too bad.   What looked really good was the scratch made biscuits with strawberry compote. We wish we had tried this.   The coffee was OUTSTANDING. No bitterness and just so good.   Service was 5/5. Food was 3.5/5 for an overall score of 4/5. We probably won't be back as there are so many other places to try in Vegas. We would come back just for the coffee though. :)",

They had this tasty new thing on the menu-deep fried deviled eggs!   It's great to see the new Container Park across the street because there wasn't much of a view the last time I was in town. This will always be my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas. They're always busy but the wait's usually not long to get seated and for the food to come out.

The wait is monstrous (even for a solo diner, due to rude fools hanging out at the bar when they're done) and they \"don't do takeout when they're busy\" so I couldn't just give them my money and leave. Food was good, but seemed like it wasn't their best effort.  Host was friendly and polite, despite being frazzled due to the crowd- a 10 minute estimate for my seat somehow turned into 40+ which was more time than I spent ordering, waiting for my food, eating, paying, and visiting another store, but I digress- with business this busy, they must be good, right?  Torn between the shrimp and grits or the truffled egg sando, I opted for the former and was only half-satisfied with my order, but by the time I got my food I was too hungry to complain. Grits were okay, bacon was crispy and added both flavor and texture, eggs were cooked perfectly, but shrimp were small and overcooked- should have been blackened, not precooked and tossed on like an afterthought. They lacked flavor and the pico was the most stand-out element of the dish, and there wasn't much of it.  I'm not generally a fan of community tables, though they're not much different than sitting at the bar- but I did make friends with the super-sweet couple who dined beside me. They ordered the egg sando and insisted I get it on my next visit. I'll eventually get around to coming back but it sure as hell won't be on a weekend.",

    "text": "For starters when we sat in the waiting area there were two dead cockroaches flipped upside down in the middle of the floor. I wanted so badly to take a picture but realized how awkward that would be. Service wasn't good at all. Not attentive, friendly, or nice. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and I was given lemonade. I see things like this as a simple mistake so I kindly asked for tea since I ordered half and half. The server (we actually had three people just rotating the whole time) told me that there was probably tea in it, and I just can't tell because the tea is very subtle. I continued to tell her it was just lemonade but she said \"yeah it's just the tea isn't really prominent\" ... Then when another lady came to refill my drink, she topped it off with the house tea that I asked for. Seeing as how I barely touched my drink... It was weird to me that the tea instantly made my drink darker and the taste was definitely prominent. But I guess that was too hard for the first lady. Our food came out within fifteen minutes which really surprised me because there were quite a few others there as well. No complaints with my eggs benedict, just thought it was a little pricey. The chicken fried steak was cold and soggy. Almost like it had been pre cooked and re heated. I could tell the flavor was there but overall it just wasn't appetizing because it didn't taste or feel fresh at all. We had no one check on our table to see how the food was. But of course they didn't hesitate to drop the check at the table and walk away. Overall I'm very surprised and disappointed. I saw all the awesome reviews and also recognized it is Zagat rated which inclined me to go here. But after paying so much for lack luster food and terrible customer service... I'll pass on returning.",

    "text": "I had lunch with my mom and grandma today because it's less than a mile from my office! I walked into Eat with a 5 star mindset. Unfortunately, I didn't get a 5 star experience.   Eat is decorated beautifully. It is rustic and urban and modern and east coast meets west coast all at the same time. Brick walls and simple art and a few rustic wooden tables and I'm in love. One star for ambiance/decor.   We sat down and our waiter came by to take our drink order. He wasn't very nice and had this look on his face like \"I can't wait to walk away from this table and I couldn't be less interested in what you want to drink.\" The drink prices are a little ridiculous. Grandma ordered tea: $4 for a cup? And $3 for a soda? Hmmm...  Also, they DO NOT have bottled water. I don't understand this. My mom tried to order bottled water and the rude waiter just said \"we don't have that.\" I asked if their water was at least filtered and he said \"well, it's not tap water but it comes from a fountain.\" ::blankstare:: What does that even mean? We ordered a glass anyway and it definitely tasted like Vegas tap water. Mom ordered coffee instead and believe it or not, the coffee tasted stale.   I ordered the DWBLT. It was DELICIOUS. I'd give 5 stars just for this sandwich if it weren't for the shitty service and awkwardly unhappy waiter. It came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough (but it actually tasted more like lightly fried bread?). The flavors were amazing and the bread was soft, but crispy. Also, the bacon was out-of-this-world good. The sandwich was oozing with freshness and definitely one of the best BLTs I've ever had! It came with homemade potato chips which were pretty good too.   My grandma had the chicken caesar salad. She seemed to enjoy it. Mom ordered the chicken sandwich and she loved it. She got potato salad with her sandwich. I took a bite and it was pretty good - not as good as the DWBLT though!   Before we were even finished eating and before our table was cleared, a waiter who wasn't ours walked by and placed our check on the table. I REALLY hate when this happens. I didn't ask for the check yet and it makes me feel rushed. And, how do you know I didn't want to order something else?   I'm not usually this critical, but this restaurant has a lot of potential. It's already popular and the food is wonderful - that's the hard part! The easy part is good customer service... and Eat is severely lacking in that department.   I'll give it another shot , though!",

    "text": "Early Saturday morning breakfast and wanted to finally try Eats since we were already downtown for an event. We won a gift certificate from a silent auction that was a Zapoo fundraiser, but sadly we couldn't find it...which would have been nice to offset the cost.  The location is horrible--on a corner in front of an old apartment building that makes it seem like the restaurant is the motel cafe. Parking, like anywhere downtown is a big pain with the unpredictable parking meter machines.  Looking around the dining room, we could tell it was filled with a lot of Zappos Hshieep. It is a typical hipster type of establishment where concept is good but execution lacks. The menu is presented on a clipboard and features breakfast and lunch items.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with 2 eggs, country gravy, Chive potatoes and toast. I opted for over easy eggs and sourdough toast. The best part of the meal was the sourdough toast...thick slices toasted perfectly. The chicken fried steak was bland and the meat was NOT good. I know cubed steak which is typically used for chicken fried steaks, is the ornery brother of meat cuts which must be tenderized/beaten into submission to properly achieve a chewable consistency. This was not. The meat under the flavorless breading was like an old shoe. The gravy was scarce and made the shoe meat too soggy (note: always get the gravy on the side), the potatoes were also flavorless and boring. The eggs were cooked right. I would not get this dish again nor recommend it. My wife ordered the 2 eggs any style with bacon, toast and chive potatoes. It was ok, nothing special and not really worth $11. Most of the menu items seemed overpriced.  Service was friendly enough but one of my pet peeves is when a server sees that most of my meal is uneaten, yet doesn't acknowledge that perhaps the meal wasn't to my satisfaction and at least offers an alternative, then goes about like a robot (Hshieep) to bring the check, box the meal etc. No thank you Eat, there too many other better places to eat. Next!",

    "text": "We woke up this morning feeling like a celebratory breakfast was in order, considering the positive outcome of the Presidential election last night! It seemed like the perfect time to try eat, downtown's newest chef-driven hotspot. I'm happy to say that chef Natalie Young's restaurant fully met my expectations, and the waitstaff seemed slightly more friendly than anticipated. I noticed mixed reviews of the service, but I'm guessing that Romney's loss put everyone in a good mood!  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was playing when we arrived, and Tony Hsieh was dining at a table in the front corner of the restaurant that I will assume is reserved for him. The soundtrack continued with the 60s/70s folk theme, which suited me just fine! Choosing between the creative egg dishes and scrambled tofu on the breakfast menu was tough, but I was most interested in the truffled egg sandwich. Served on a buttery croissant (presumably from Chocolate & Spice, like the other pastries served at eat), the sandwich featured a flavorful melted cheese, perfectly scrambled eggs, sauteed wild mushrooms, and a side of tasty breakfast potatoes. I won't be surprised when I see one of those Food Network \"stars\" describing this dish as The Best Thing They Ever Ate, as it is certainly worthy of the praise. My request to leave the bacon off the sandwich was granted without attitude. The wild mushroom mix likely included some pesky shiitakes, but they were tastefully prepared.  I love the feel of this restaurant and can't wait to return to sample the huevos motulenos and explore the lunch menu. My only complaint would be the difficulty of obtaining a coffee refill, but I'm not inclined to subtract a star for that.",

The eggs benedict was very good, with the combo of crunchy toasted English muffin, spinach, tomato and hollandaise sauce. Our waitress gave us fair warning about the smaller portion of this dish so no shocker there.  Free range chicken sandwich was also very yummy. Service was fast and staff was super friendly.",

Melt in your mouth, perfect proportion sauce to food ratio delicious.   My friend shared with me the most delectable, delightful, fluffy but not too fluffy pancakes EVER. I thought I didn't like pancakes. Apparently other establishments have just served mediocrity.   I can't wait to go back to try other foods! I wish it was open longer--waking up to trek downtown on Saturday or Sunday morning is not my forte, but it will definitely be worth it to make it happen. Also, super dope bonus points for it being woman of color owned! Yayyuhhh.",

    "text": "We were curious to see what this place was like.  I'd read about it online and my spouse had seen something about Bourdain having been here.  We are almost always looking for breakfasty brunchy things around 11am-1pm and especially when in Las Vegas.  We called on a Monday and no one answered.  Tuesday we just happened to be in the area on our way to some fair, single deck blackjack at the El Cortez and there it was... eat!  Not sure how my spouse got the curse, but everywhere she goes she/we get seated immediately next to the restroom door, service station or whatever worst table they have.  No different here.  They seated us next to some rolling trays of syrup in little jars right where the servers buzz by on their way out of the kitchen.  We've stopped asking why.  This time we just accepted it.    One of my favorite all time dishes is Shrimp and Grits so that jumped out at me from the menu.  Of course, it's a breakfast version with bacon slices, over easy eggs and sauce right on top.  It was very tasty and I can honestly say I've never had bacon and shrimp in my mouth at the same time.  That was a little different.  Visually this dish wasn't that appealing, but considering the consistency of grits...  The grits were a bit saucy and considering the fact that they were supporting so much, it might make sense to cook them up a little <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffirmer.in&s=d092ea8e353b6829ac74c9714bfe13ad0d2d8e1c35603a4ed9f73d279829be97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">firmer.in</a> this dish.  It got very messy once a yoke was cut open with my fork, but hey, I ate every bite!    Probably didn't need to but it felt like toast was needed so I ordered a side of wheat.  The slices are very thick and not toasted but grilled.  Spouse didn't eat hers.  She got the corned beef has breakfast.  Said it was delicious!    Overall the place a a trendy, young professional hang out with lots of young techie types eating together, talking business and checking their devices.  The staff was accommodating although they were a bit rushed and didn't have time to understand that the spouse wanted nothing on her grits because she like butter and sugar on them - ugh! - so they brought hers with chives on top even though all she asked for was extra butter.    It's not one of those \"best biscuits & gravy\" type of breakfast/lunch places.  They are the same everywhere.  This is definitely a more upscale type of establishment and given the opportunity to eat here again, I would!",

    "text": "I like Eat. I like the fact that it's modern, hip, urban, and located downtown. Charm, character, and frankly, they need more places like these downtown. Just across the street from Container Park and down the street from LVA (geez, where were all these places when I was a student?!).   PARKING: There's metered parking galore for around $2 an hour during the daytime around here and DO NOT think you can get away without being fined.   PROTIP: Get a player's card at El Cortez (free; takes two minutes) and you get to park for FREE at either of the manned parking garages (located at 7th and Ogden). Even when they charge $10 parking on Fridays/Saturday nights now, it's free if you flash your card. If you suck at parallel parking like I do even for the after-6pm free street parking, then park in the garages (you don't have to worry about walking too far to get to Container Park or the Fremont East bars).   AMBIANCE: Eat. is a cute breakfast/lunch place. They're only open 8AM-3PM on weekdays and close an hour earlier on weekends. I like the decor and there's a ton of seating here for 2-4 people tables. Great use of space without feeling too cramped. There's a nice breakfast bar area near the cashier but I feel like it's a secret \"oh-god-please-don't-pick-to-sit-here-because-you'll-just-stare-at-us\"-type thing. Luckily there's another high table bar in the center that you can sit at.   Hip, casual atmosphere. Fun place to meet with friends or a semi-loud business lunch.  FOOD: I ordered the chicken sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (they offer it every monday) Every other day than monday, they offer a special off-menu item so be sure to ask!   I thought it was kind of funny listing \"free-range chicken\" at every mention in the menu. I wanted to ask my server for a profile of my slaughtered hen right there. You know, just to make sure it was a happy free-range chicken when it was living.   Chicken pot pie ($14ish?) was good. Nicely seasoned with the right amount of mashed potatoes, gravy (dear god the gravy), carrots, slices of moist chicken, and peas inside. The pastry encasing it was fluffy, golden, and wasn't too hard biting into it. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens and sliced carrots. Presentation was nice! Does it blow me away for what it is flavor-wise? Nope. Delicious, yes. Very well-thought out, but not wowing. Portion was decent, but not really worth the price tag.   My chicken sausage ($5ish) side dish was okay. A bit tough, but the flavor was decent. Honey-soaked flavor. Tasted fine but not really worth the price for portion honestly.   Service was good. Checked back on us often and our server recommended the pot pie to me.   VERDICT: Overall, Eat is a few unique steps up from your average brunch place. Presentation of the food is gorgeous and the flavors are good/okay, but the price tag? Ouch. Maybe it's quality of the ingredients that justifies it. The food isn't mediocre by any means, but it's not something stunning as I'm led to believe. It's a great place to reenact scenes from Portlandia. I would definitely come back for lunch with the girlfriends. I like Eat a lot, but I'm not drinking the kool-aid just yet.",

Even down to a lot of the photos that are posted here on Yelp, that is how the food always looks when I order it or I see it pass by my table.   I regularly get the pancakes. They are always crispy on the outside and on the edges while being soft and fluffy on the inside. The size is always generous with it filling up most of the plate it comes on. Instead of maple syrup, I normally ask for a side of their homemade strawberry compote to go along with it. I don't normally eat pancakes that way, even if I am at home, but it ends up being a good addition to a already good pancake. Also, while the chive potatoes are good on their own, I would suggest ordering a side of their gravy used for the country fried steak, and pouring some of it over your potatoes. You will not regret it.  Come early since you might end up waiting a bit, especially on the weekends and especially on Sunday, but when you do, get ready for a treat in the downtown area.",

    "text": "I had bookmarked this spot because I saw some rave reviews about it a while back. Finally got around to eating here on my last trip and now I'm wondering what all the fuss was about. It's good, but nothing I had made it rise to greatness. Although, to be fair I didn't exactly order the most exciting thing on the menu.   I got eggs. Two scrambled eggs, to be exact. And they came with smoked bacon and chive potatoes and toast, which was of the rye variety. All of the above was sufficiently cooked and tasty. None of it was particularly noteworthy, though I will point out that I give props to any place serving rye bread. If they really wanted to get on my good side, they'd serve pumpernickel or squaw.   My gf ordered something called a \"skinny jenny\" which was pretty damn good. I don't know why they give it a girly, low-cal name that makes it sound like a dish catering to women. I would have ordered one, too, if it had a moniker that sounded more unisex. My eyes wandered right over it because it sounded like some health food thing tailored for girls trying to keep off the pounds.",

It's a room with nothing on the walls or floors to absorb the sound so it's very loud. After we were seated it took nearly 5 minutes for the server just to get to the table.   The menu is limited in that they are all about that meat and potatoes thing with very few alternative options: no meatless, vegetarian, or gluten free items.   I opted for a bowl of steel cut oats topped with strawberries & pecans and it was ok. Certainly nothing special about a bowl of oatmeal so I'm not even sure what I expected here. No PB and most have never heard of putting it in your oatmeal. But if you don't, all you get is a bowl of carbs for breakfast  Do they even know what bill time is? In all the time I've been eating out I have never had any restaurant not give me a credit card receipt. It is not your position to assume I don't want one and I should never have to ask for it. Always get a credit card receipt to help prevent fraud.   Not going back here. The end.",

I must admit while roaming the area looking for the restaurant, the neighborhood had a \"character\" that almost made me turn around. I mean I like your average barefoot, toothless, bearded guy as much as the next gal, but maybe not joining me to grab a bite. My friends tenacity prevailed and we found eat, once inside we were glad we had stayed on course. The ambiance is great! Think modern, casual, and fun. Service was prompt and knowledgable. We ordered the posole soup to share as a starter. It was great, the broth was flavorful and it came with all the traditional garnishes and was chock full of yummy hominy. For lunch he had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and I had the arugula salad. The salad was meh, but I ordered wrong. If you come here you MUST get a sandwich! Let me repeat MUST.  The grilled bread is insane, like you take a moment before you devour because it is so perfect. Get any sandwich, any, and you will be happy. Needless to say, I'll be back, and order like a pro.",

This salad is so boring, this is how i can describe it: bowl of 95% arugula with 2 pieces of asparagus, 2 cashews and about 3 tomatoes with the minimum amount of Parmesan cheese shavings. For the price, omg, not worth it just don't get it. I finished my bowl of arugula within 3 minutes. Also my \"server\" Roberto, didn't even help me at all. A black girl really nice helped me out with questions, grabbing my drink, and taking my order, while -----Roberto(0 stars)---- was supposed to be my server he didn't even check if the food was right, how anything was, nothing, all he did was drop off the check and run my card. Just ask for another server when you go there. Also, this might not be the place to get salad but for having only two salads in the menu, they need to step up their game. Id give the restaurant 1 star but I'm doing 2 because the rest of the staff were very nice and happy and the place look nice and clean. I might give it another chance and order a sandwich since i come to Vegas about 10-12 times/month, but I might just also go somewhere else for salads. Sorry my review was long but I had to get my frustration out of my chest. Kuddos!",

I went in this day which is a Sunday and asked can I still make a to go order since it was about 12 minutes till close.  The hostess said we don't do to go orders on the weekend.  This is fine I totally understand not taking a call in to go order, but I'm standing right there. Like even when I'm right here? So I walked away from that stupidity.  Although I walked away, I was thinking about how dumb that was and how if I were to order and sit down and when the food got there I said hey I have to go. Would they take my food away? No they would have given me a box. Why couldn't that have happened? Anyway I was just being lazy and didn't want to walk another block..lesson learned.",

    "text": "Wow go to Vegas a couple of times a year and we like to stay in the downtown area.  Most of the hotels (even the Nugget) have ordinary breakfast.  So we were so exited when this place opened a couple of years ago.  Not the best neighborhood, but getting better.  In the beginning we would wait on lines to get in and it was all worth while.  The food was very well prepared and the service was too.  This time we went on Nov 13th.  The place was less than half full.  We got our coffee quickly and I noticed it was not was I was used to...maybe they changed the brand.  The we ordered our breakfast, eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancakes...the works.  My eggs were not fresh off the grill.. one of the yolks was broken and my toast came after I had eaten the eggs and potatoes.  I asked three times for a coffee refill and waited almost ten minutes to get it.  Meanwhile I could see the wait staff chatting in the kitchen area not really paying attention to us.  The pancakes came out dry as if the were made an hour earlier and then reheated.  Bottom line.  I can do just as well at the hotels or better.",

I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. The food was absolutely delicious! I ordered coffee, cinnamon biscuits, bacon, eggs, & potatoes. The portions were hearty and the food was fresh and tasty. I gave them 4* because of the floor. It's a cement floor with a glossy slick finish. I almost slipped on it. Be careful when walking inside the restaurant could be a serious safety hazard.",

Let me start off by saying that at this point it is over hyped. The only thing I crave about this place is their pancakes. Previous time I came w/ my mother we waited for over 30 minutes which is fine w.e. Our waiter seriously only checked up on us about twice and what made me so angry was that they gave us the check before our food even came out!!!! Are you effin kidding me? I let it go and didn't say anything. For some reason I felt like we were treated as minority's since everyone else in the room was white except us. I had their shrimp and grits and it was okay, lacked a lot of flavor. Today we went back with my family and waited for over an hour! The host kept seating people left & right instead of trying to hold a table for us since a lot of people came after us. I understand smaller parties get seated quicker but it was only 6 of us. Anyways we finally got seated and our waitress was great. Can't complain we were checked up on multiple times. But the food was not what it used to be. Very sad to say that I probably won't be coming back here again and deff not recommending it to others any longer.",

I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was so disgusting. Floating in oil/butter and topped with pico de gallo. Why would I want pico on shrimp and grits but they refused to remove it when asked. The other guests with me ordered pancakes that came out burned. There were several employees that looked like they were 16 and were confused about what they were bringing us. I could go on with more poor service we received, but you get the point. Terrible!!",

So I came here with my wife and good friend to have some breakfast months ago and going there i realized pulling up that i had to pay for parking. I think all restaurants should have a designated area to park or offer free parking with a punch card kind of like going to a casino and having validated parking.  Lets get to the meal we ordered alot of things. My wife had the Shrimp n Grits (4/5 stars) I had my usual Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which didn't really wow me so (3/5) Also Ordered Grilled Cheese and A Order Of pancakes Both (3/5).  Nothing here is really memorable besides the shrimp and grits so i definitely recommend it. Other than that service is solid and i know this place will do just fine because people love to come eat breakfast. And as long as they keep their ingredients fresh which they do they will be a popular eatery for a long time.   Thanks for a solid meal. Not sure ill be back anytime soon but  we enjoyed the place.",

The food was great and I definitely recommend trying the cinnamon biscuits, they are very unique to this place and very tender and delicious. The presentation is gorgeous and they provide a lot of fresh fruit with it; However, the jam that they use for the biscuits is very high in sugar and hurt my teeth (but none the less still delicious). I didn't taste a lot of truffle in the truffled egg sandwich and the corned beef was more potatoes than beef. I still would give them the five stars because I appreciate how fast and attentive they were!",

    "text": "I've been to Eat a few times before since it's pretty close by. It's a solid place for breakfast foods/brunch with a twist. Everything I've ever had at Eat has been great, and I look forward to trying new things from them.   The restaurant itself is decently sized, but seeing the amount of foot traffic this place gets, it's clear they should consider relocating to a larger location in downtown. The only negative about Eat is that the wait can be eternal if you go during lunch time. We came at around 10:30 am on a weekday and it was a 25-30 wait. I've been when the wait was 40-45 min, so try to come at a slower time if you want to be seating within 10 min.  We got the Shrimp Po Boy, Shrimp and Grits, and the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. The shrimp po boy was good, but the shrimp to vegetable ratio was very skewed towards the vegetables. There was barely any shrimps in the sandwich.   The shrimp and grits were very good, and when the egg's yolk breaks into the grits, it's rich and heavenly. The pico on top gives it a nice fresh flavor and gives it some texture.  One of the best things they had there was the OJ. It's fresh squeezed and sweet, and it's everything you could want in a nice OJ. The only downside was that it was $6. Kind of pricey, but if you're feeling zesty, it's a good option.  Overall, the food is good. The wait sucks. Get the shrimp and grits or the grilled cheese. Don't forget the OJ.",

The shrimp Po-boy is light and refreshing not the usual New Orleans style Po-boy, I've become accustom to. My only critique, are the limited weekly hours.",

We wanted something other than the regular Boyd casino buffets and found this place a hop, skip and away next to container park.  We walked in and they had a good crowd inside. We thought the wait was gonna be long, but it wasn't. They sat us right away.  I'll get straight to it.....  LOCATION: convenient, close to the Fremont experience, about a 3 minute walk.  PARKING: lots of street parking everywhere   SERVICE: quick, friendly, fast.... they got everything we ordered correct.  FOOD: AMAZEBALLS! truffle egg sandwich! The food here was sooooooooooo delicious! Truffled egg sandwich! Truffled egg sandwich!  PRICE: worth every penny... affordable but not cheap. Like I said, worth every penny. This place won't break your wallet :)  My next trip back to Vegas, I'm definitely stopping by here for breakfast!",

They open at 8 in the morning and it's by the court house where people usually have to be there so early in the morning! And the food is delicious!!!   I always get grits and side of bacon! Just because that's the way I roll! :) lol. But at time I order their devil eggs which is a MUST TRY!!! it's a fried devil eggs so delicious! It's rich, but crunchy and the way the play with food texture in this particular dish will blow your mind! And your taste bud!   Their sweet biscuits I believe is their most popular items! It's pretty amazing itself! It's sweet but they put tangy strawberry in it which helps with the sweetness of the syrup they drizzled in it! And the saltiness from the biscuits brings it to a different level.   And one must say they have a pretty strong coffee here!! Just perfect to start your morning!! :)  Service is pretty on point! Fast and never disappoint!   Over all pretty awesome place! Keep it up!!",

    "text": "Located in downtown Vegas, a spot revisited by locals and extra brownie points if found by tourists. It's a local spot that has a great sense of community with emphasis on all things comfort. All ingredients are responsibly sourced with leafy greens locally sourced. The space comes together with different elements from the green colored walls, to the exposed brick with the mixture of mismatched paintings and decor. Bringing in a bright and relaxed atmosphere, great breakfast brunch vibe that's rumored to push out pretty damn good comfort food.   We all ended up getting sandwiches which were all served on their ciabatta bun, let's just rave over how perfect this bread was. Crisp outer layer with the soft spongy interior that soaks up all the juices and sauces that are layered on. Talk about levels of flavour. Who knew the bun that a sandwich is served on could elevate the meal so much more.   Shrimp Po'Boy - ($14) - Juicy sauteed shrimp topped with spicy napa slaw and cilantro finished with a sriracha mayo. This was a darn good sandwich. Spicy mayo and the spicy slaw gave a really good kick in flavour and there was a hefty amount of shrimp stuffed in between. Recommend 100%  Roast Beef - ($14) - The flawless layers of roast beef with another flawless layer of arugula, presentation alone was captivating. Served with mayo with sprinkles of pickled red onions, this was a heavy sandwich compared to the shrimp but flavours were awesome and also really satisfying.    Free Range Chicken - ($12) One of the more basic sandwiches with the added addition of their pesto mayo; which was probably the ingredient that stood out the most. Added with that ciabatta bun and boy, this basic juicy chicken sandwich just leveled up to a whole new experience.  All of the sandwich choices had a slice of pickle and the added option of choosing between chip, soup,salad or potato salad. I opted for chips and the other two got the potato salad. My chips were yummy, but the potato salad wasn't a crowd pleaser for us. Not creamy enough to our liking I suppose.   Service wasn't spectacular. Had to ask our server twice for a water refill, huffed when we wanted to clarify the brunch menu items and all in all didn't seem pleased that she had to serve us. she also didn't remember to add our orange juice to the bill, which made up for the shoddy service.",

If you're in luck like me this time around, the bar area is first come, first serve so score! The bar area has about 6-8 seating? Can't recall exactly.   The 3 dishes my party got were the Golden-Brown pancakes with strawberries, Chilaquiles and Corned Beef Hash. All were delicious but the top favs were the Chilaquiles and pancakes. The Chilaquiles had a lot of flavor and the jalapeno mango sausage has a slight kick but not spicy at all. The pancakes were fluffy and very breakfast.  When you're walking through the crowded room, scoping out what others have ordered, you can't help but be drawn to the pancakes.   2nd time here and planning on coming by when we're in downtown!",

The place is nice and small and quaint on the inside with lots of charm and character. The music they are playing is relaxing and feel good and the customer service is not bad at all either.   Now the food, I had every thing a la cart which was a little cheaper than ordering the meal. I had bacon, two eggs, potatoes and toast. It was more than filling to me and two large glasses of OJ which was very fresh. I would definitely recommend this place to eat and it's off the hustle and bustle of the Strip.

Also great service, good coffee and the pancakes I ordered were absolutely delicious - They came with strawberries, banana, and a chicken sausage - I had my doubts about the sausage at first, but it was a perfect flavor balance!!

You can upgrade your toast to a pancake  for only $1 or add on a short stack for $7 and if you go here and don't have a pancake you are missing out.   I would go back here every day and be happy!",

    "text": "Eat is my favorite brunch place in Vegas so far. As a Phoenician, we travel to Vegas a few times every year and always make a stop somewhere for brunch. I was impressed by the food which I can't say about all the other places we've been to. I ordered the corned beef hash and loved it. The corned beef was nicely cubed, along with the potatoes. It was crispy and absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a fan of poached eggs but those were a nice addition. I had pancakes on the side which they served with individually packed maple syrup jars. The pancakes were fluffy on the inside and nicely crisp on the outside and were topped with strawberries. We also shared the deviled eggs and liked it. A friend of mine had a side of the potatoes and for some reason, they weren't all that great.   We were lucky for not having to wait too long - about 20 minutes for a table of 7 on a Sunday afternoon. The service was okay; most were fantastic while one particular server wasn't very courteous. Prices were affordable and lacked the pretentiousness and overpriced dishes that lined the Vegas strip. Needless to say, we will definitely be back for brunch.",

I had corned beef hash with poached eggs and my better half just ordered home fries and sausage.  Coffee was fresh and tasty. The location in downtown Las Vegas is easy to get to (hoping the construction on Carson is done soon!), and located across the street from the Container Park.  Metered street parking was easy to obtain and inexpensive too.  All in all  Eat is a great spot for breakfast, lunch or brunch!",

    "text": "Looking for a bite to eat before our EDC weekend, we found Eat. on Yelp as one of the nearby restaurants close to our hotel. After reviewing the menu online, we decided to give this place a try. Luckily when we arrived, there was a table opening up for our group of 6 so we waited at most 10 minutes. We were seated promptly and after deciding on our food, ordered with the waitress. After putting in our order, she asked us if we would like to try their Fried Deviled Eggs. One of our friends perked up as she was debating on trying them, and we all decided to share an order.   La 'Kat's Deviled Eggs (4pc - $8.00): These are basically what they are called - fried deviled eggs. They are topped with small pieces of bacon and chives; the egg is entirely breaded and fried. Many other reviews raved about these, but I didn't see anything special to them. They were good, but not $2.00/piece good.   Tofu Scramble ($11.00): Pretty good serving size - they give you plenty of potatoes that had some salt seasoning on top of them, with the Tofu scramble mixed with mushrooms, green onions and sprouts on top. The flavor was delicious and everything worked really well together! I'm an extreme bread lover....their bread is SO GOOD. It might be silly of me to be so enthusiastic about just bread, but THIS ISN'T JUST BREAD! So fluffy and thick, whichever kind of bread you ordered whether it be wheat, sourdough or white, these slices of bread are AMAZING.   Corned Beef Hash ($15.00): My boyfriend got this and of course I wanted to try some. This is a bit different from other Corned Beef Hashes we've had - they had cubes of meat, almost similar to ham cubes? Still it was very tasty, but not what we're used to. The eggs were cooked amazingly though!  Definitely filled us all up for the long day after. If we ever stay Downtown again, I'd definitely come back for that toast!!!",

We had enough time to walk through that container area across the street and came back and still waited about 10 minutes more.  We got seated at a table that was meant for 4 people but they added another chair, so it was a bit tight once all the food was on the table. I ordered the Golden-Brown Pancakes which were some of the best pancakes I have ever had. I also ordered the La 'Kat's Deviled Eggs, it was like there was a party going on in my mouth! They were so good! Our table shared an order of the Cinnamon Biscuits which was only okay, nothing great. My aunt ordered the chicken fried steak and they brought out her plate with everything but the chicken fried steak! It was pretty funny and our waitress took it back once we pointed it out and brought out the full dish, chicken fried steak and all.  They have a cute outdoor area that looked like it would be nice to sit in. I would recommend sitting out there. It felt like too many people inside the restaurant at once.",

We tried an order of the biscuits with strawberry compote as a starter for the table. It was a huge portion & super delicious. Easily could have been a meal on its own.   As each of our meals came out, we were shocked by the portion sizes (esp for the prices!). All of the meals were massive & hearty, but didn't lack flavor or quality. Each meal was around $15.   The pancakes were huge & delicious. My husband was unable to even eat half of the 3 pancakes that came with the meal. I was surprised however the blueberry pancakes did not have any blueberries in them, but rather just fresh blueberries sprinkled on top. The breakfast burrito was a more reasonable portion size, but still more than enough. It had great flavors & ingredients.   Everyone in our group was very happy with our meal here. Great food & service and an awesome atmosphere for a brunch with friends.",

The menu is thin, not your typical breakfast spot with a massive menu, but the offerings are unique in a good way.  Since I was craving pancakes I decided to get a short stack (2 cakes).  Warning: the pancakes are thick, dense, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, with a hint of cinnamon (I think).  They're yummy, but I couldn't eat them all along when my generous portion of potatoes!  Definitely worth a try if your tired of the regular breakfast eats.",

Overall, the food was excellent.  For example, the huevos motulenos are excellent, the combination of items unusual and well-executed.  The chicken-fried steak was not excellent but was good.  One member of the family got a dish that was not well executed but I have completely blanked out on what it was.  There is a nice range of lighter and more substantial dishes of varying types.  Decor and interior is attractive and comfortable and it's nice to have a place like this downtown.  It's not a favourite breakfast place in Las Vegas, but it's pretty close.    One drawback was the service was not good- it was rather unfriendly and not helpful.",

In particular, I love the Truffled Egg sandwich (I love truffles).   Also the Deviled Eggs are not to be missed.   During peak times, the wait can be long, and it can get a little loud.

    "text": "NOTE:  My visit to Eat was during my trip in October 2018.  \"I'll see you in the flowers\".  The above phrase was written endlessly on one of the restaurant walls (I wish I had made an effort to take a picture).  Think HP5......sans the  power hungry head mistress, the black quill, and searing pain.  There was an entire wall with just this one brief sentence.  Simplicity and intrigue rolled into one (and captures your attention as well).  LOCATION / PARKING: Across the street from the Downtown Container Park.  Street parking available.  Don't forget to feed the meter!  SETTING: The restaurant space is open and inviting, largely due in part to its welcoming/friendly staff and unique decor (one of which is mentioned above).  Enlarged black and white photos of randon and eclectic images adorn the restaurant walls.  Seating are bar height tables, tables seating two or four, counter seating facing the kitchen, as well as tables seating two against a wall with a cushion backrest.    FOOD: There's no need to turn to page 394, as the menu is simply presented on a clipboard with the logo in the background.  Breakfast fare selections include sweet & savory (granola, pancakes), dishes served till 11am (huevos motulenos, chicken fried steak, etc), eggs all day (two eggs any style, corned beef hash, etc).  Other choices include soups, salads, and sandwiches.   Ironically, even though there was so many tantalizing entrees on the menu, my friend and I ordered the same dish:  the corned beef hash.  Not there was anything wrong with that, but oh how I wish I could borrow Hermione's time tuner to correct that slight gaff.  We also ordered coffee and a fruit bowl to accompany our meal.  The verdict:  the corned beef has was excellent.  Incredibly good and a decent portion size.  The dish was prepared well, from the toast to the poached eggs, to the hash itself.  The chunks of diced meat were mixed with potatoes that were chopped into blocks of equal size.  The two poached eggs were served centered on the meat with the toast flanking the eggs like a half moon.  Overall, simple presentation of a delicious meal.  SERVICE: Simply outstanding.  The staff/servers exuded friendly customer service from the moment we stepped thru the door.  I can't express the degree of welcome that we experienced and received during our meal/visit at Eat.  Our server expertly answered all our questions, and checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  And like a winning quidditch team, the teamwork and cooperation amongst the staff was clearly visible and noticeable.  BOTTOM LINE: Welcoming environment, great food, outstanding service.  I hope to return if I ever find myself in DTLV in the future.",

Downtown holds some of my favorite spots to eat and this is no exception. Great location and in easy walking distance from several other attractions in the area. We when on a weekday right when they opened up, we were seated quickly and the service was excellent throughout the meal. This place filled up quick! By the time we left folks were waiting in line (again, on a weekday morning!) and for good reason. This place also offers outdoor seating if your catch good weather during your visit.   Food was very good. I ordered chicken fried steak, and normally I'm picky about white gravy but I would order this one again in a heart beat, it had great flavor. They also have some pretty stellar breakfast potatoes. I sampled a little of everything on the table and would have been pleased to order any of it again, I'm sure you really can't go wrong with the breakfast menu.   My only complaint would be that the menu could stand to be slightly larger for a little more variety.   I'm definitely adding Eat. to my list of breakfast regulars, I already can't wait to go back.",

I didn't find anything special about the restaurant or menu items.  We're from Ga and came here for Lady's Gaga concert and we are a group of 30-50s year old women. One got granola , egg and bacon.$17 The other got spinach salad with chicken $17 I got the Cesar salad with 1 egg $15. I attached my Cesar salad.  I won't be coming back unless we have brunch.",

As you escape from the Downtown Las Vegas heat. Today I had a passion fruit Ice Tea with the Truffle Egg Sandwich. But I eyed another customers deep fried Devil eggs another customer had ordered at his table and had to order a side of those as well. They where amazing!!! Sounds a little crazy Deep fried Eggs but the crunch was just right and the flavor was amazing. The truffle sandwich was very delicious as well. Everything had great flavor and the service was quick and efficient my ice tea was never low!! I would recommend you stop by and try it out if you are in the Downtown area.",

Buzzing with patrons, yet I could still have a conversation at a normal volume.  The food was absolutely delicious. We ended up ordering five plates: The DWBLTA, the Shrimp Po' Boy, the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup, the Pozole, and the Black Bean Veggie Chili. Had I been solo, I would have eaten everything myself. The Pozole had a great kick after swallowing a bite, the bread on the DWBLTA and the Grilled Cheese was so perfectly crispy/crunchy and buttery good.   While we had our sights set on breakfast, we were not dissatisfied with lunch one iota. I'm looking forward to returning very soon to tackle the breakfast menu.",

The food was good, but I'm convinced I didn't probably order the best thing on the menu. I went the route of a veggie burger (which I was told they don't make themselves, but they are shipped in, deconstructed, and then more ingredients are added. Probably not my favorite selling point!) but it was delicious and I topped it off with a cup of chicken posole soup.   I did get a little food envy over the grilled cheese at times!!!! HUGE Texas toast with a nice gooey cheesy filling? Yes, please!",

    "text": "After a couple of visits, I figured it was time to writ ea review. Both visits have come on weekends, where the menu is slightly different. The second visit was on a Sunday, when you don't have to dig for quarters to feed the meter.  I've now had the beignets, pancakes, Downtown Benedict (only available on the weekends) and Huevos Motulenos. All of the food has been outstanding. In fact, if I was rating this place just on the food, it probably would have been a five-star rating. The servers were competent, but nothing special. In fact, my coffee cup sat empty for long stretches on both visits.   My real issue comes down to the lack of an overall \"WOW\" that I'd expect from a Downtown Project-invested business. First, when ordering today we were informed of a new policy that forbids substitutions on the weekend. Something as simple as swapping the sausage out for bacon or asking for eggs over medium instead of eggs over easy. The server even said he didn't want to submit it because he didn't want any more demerits. Second, when we went to pay, there was a note in folio that \"when they are slammed\" they only accept one credit card when checks are being split. Both of these policies will be enough to stop the casual diner from returning. Substitutions are a reality in the restaurant business and splitting checks among multiple credit cards is also commonplace.   Finally, we did not receive a \"warm fuzzy\" from Chef Nat. She was there on both of my visits and, even though she wasn't working in the kitchen, never stopped by our table. In fact, on my most recent visit looked downright unpleasant until my wife said \"have a nice day.\"   Ultimately, the key to a great restaurant is great food and great service. They definitely have the food down. The service just needs to catch up.",

    "text": "This place has a hipster feel to it with cute stuff in the waiting area (guitar, bike, old typewriter, etc).   Came here in a group of five at approx. 11am on a Sunday. Told the hostess party of five and was told the wait would be 45 minutes. We decided to wait, lest we leave and spend the same amount of time finding another restaurant.  Nearly an hour later, we asked the hostess for a status update, to which she told us she had called us and we did not respond.  What she actually meant was, despite each of us making eye contact with her like little puppies, she called for a party of four, which of course we didn't respond, being a party of five, and she moved down her list.  So after watching the hostess seat everyone else, we asked how much longer to be seated. Another girl (manager?) came over and basically treated our friend like she was in the wrong for not answering to \"party of four\" since that's what the hostess meant - us.  We were seated next, waiter was nice, and the food came out quickly (maybe they rushed it for us?). Otherwise they never really acknowledged that they fudged up.   All this being said, the food was pretty good. I had their grilled cheese - you can't really mess up a grilled cheese (note: the bread slices on everything were wicked thick).   So 3 stars because the food was good, but nothing special, and the hostess was apparently only somewhat competent.   While I would recommend it as a brunch spot, expect a wait on weekends and do your best to enunciate your name and party size to the hostess.",

    "text": "Eat is such an interesting place to eat. First of all, it's located just outside of Downtown Vegas, and on the bottom floor of an apartment building. So weird! But I read promising reviews on Yelp, and my friend recommended it too, so I decided to give it a try.   First impression, nice ambience. Nice artwork on the walls. And overall a pretty neat place to eat. There's an art school down the street so I wonder if they have something to do with it.   When my bf and I showed up, luckily a table was just leaving, so we got seated right away. I saw beignets on the menu and had to try it! However.. i'm not impressed. It tasted like frozen dough that's fried. It was really heavy and not fluffy at all.   The Huevos Montelenos which is basically Huevos Ranchers was SO GOOD. I have to go back. There was so much food and so much flavor. I loved it.   My bf ordered the chicken fried steak which was delicious as well. He enjoyed it, but I personally liked my dish better.  We ended with some coffee and overall, thought the food was excellent.   HOWEVER! We asked for the check, then asked for the check, then asked for the check probably 3 more times. Waiters kept coming and apologizing for the wait and they'll get to it right away.. and then never do. Finally, when I wanted to walk out without paying, they finally brought it.. probably 45 minutes after we completely finished our meal and our tables were cleaned. That's pretty bad service.  Overall, I'd come back for the food, and to give their service a second chance, but if I have to waste 45 minutes waiting for the check, that's a definite no-go. It's Saturday, I have places to go and people to see.",

    "text": "Believe the hype.  FOOD: The SHRIMP AND GRITS were outstanding. Perfectly cooked shrimp resting in a bed of (cheesy?) grit goodness. The grits are soft and compliment the tender shrimp and eggs. I knew there was a slice of bacon at the bottom of the bowl and I considered asking for my bacon on the side. Yes, I have no shame. But I forgot and I'm so glad I did. The soft thick bacon added texture and salt to the lovely dish.What was the seasoning on the grits? I am embarrassed to say that I didn't slow down enough to think about it. I tried to savor the meal, but ended up demolishing everything on my plate in record time.   I wish I could say that I'll try a number of other dishes during future visits. But I won't. I have fallen in love (maybe deep like) and have very little desire to explore the rest of the (intriguing) menu.    If you are unsure about the commitment to quality in this place, keep an eye out for the owner. I saw her wave and chat with a few tables and then go right back to the business of keeping on eye on service and food. In the short time I was there, I saw her giving instruction to a waiter struggling (or so it seemed) with a larger table, checking the hollandaise sauce, and preparing a few plates.  SERVICE: The service was excellent. The host didn't give us an accurate (on any level) wait time, but he was warm. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  That's all I need.   VIBE: Earthy, eclectic hipster with an edge  EXCUSES: You've already read about the negatives--it can be loud, the meter situation is a hassle, and there will be a wait. But the food is worth it. The city could start construction on Carson and I'd just wear comfy shoes and walk a ways to get to those shrimp and grits.   If this is where the Vegas food scene is headed (quality ingredients, playful offerings, delicious food, good customer service, community atmosphere), I am excited to support the businesses leading the charge. I'll be back to eat.",

    "text": "I opted for eating here because my usual breakfast place is no longer open for business and downtown area is near my neighborhood. I was excited to try this little joint but wasn't wowed like most of the folks seem to be.   The service was friendly, fast and accurate and the mood of the restaurant was very California hipster vibeish, which should be expected for a place like eat.  I had the 2 eggs, bacon and chive potatoes breakfast for $10 with $3 passion iced tea, my hubby had the huevos montelunos for $11 and $4 OJ and he was not too thrilled about the overwhelming flavors that weren't mixed in well.   The main complaint on his part was that there were some bites that were too spicy and some that were too sweet, therefore the concoction didn't seem to pair off very well but he still liked the meal.  I on the other hand can't justify paying $10 for a mediocre breakfast. The portions were very small and it was nothing special. I would have liked to have ordered something different but there wasn't too much on the menu to choose from. So I opted for the simple, expecting that at least the size of the meal would compensate for the lack of wow factor.  I know about keeping the choices on the menu simple but this was just way too plain. So in a nutshell for me this joint was just okay nothing really special and not really sure I would recommend it but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it out.",

I've never been disappointed with the quality or presentation of the food, but the service is lackluster at almost all times.   I've visited eat a handful of times as both a dine-in and to-go patron. In the restaurant, I've waited 30+ minutes for a BLT sandwich.  Once when I ordered to-go, it took me 15 to walk through the small dining room to find someone that could take my to-go order. When it was ready, nobody alerted me or brought the food out to the front (I had to ask if the prepared food that had been on the bar counter for a while was for me - it was). When I got to my destination with the order, I realized I had been charged for chicken not added to a salad, and no utensils were provided for eating. They also offered no to-go cups, so drinks were not an option.",

My girlfriend and I really wanted to try out this place as it has been on our Instagram newsfeeds for the last month or so. I couldn't take the heckling I received via social media and thus forced myself into the oblivion... and shawty was I not disappointed.   As a \"Yelper\" I'm going to do my best to not throw around the holy \"5 Stars\" unless it is deserved. This place deserved it. Location wise, it isn't the most convenient but good food is always worth the the drive and in this case, area wise, worth the risk. I may be over exaggerating but it isn't the nicest part of town, but I'll be honest and say I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. I assume you usually would have to pay for parking as there are meters everywhere, coming here on a Sunday we so graciously avoided that. So firstly, come on a Sunday.   We walk in and you just feel the vibe. It's like, \"who cares that you're here just eat!\" kinda vibe. The wait was minimal at least and the spot is decently sized for a downtown restaurant. We were sat down and greeted almost immediately. The service was on point, one of those places that you're kind of taken back by how friendly everyone is.   The food. Ah yes the food. We both ordered some generous cups of coffee to get us started, good coffee can make a place. We decided to try their beignets, which were accompanied by a side of this berry-concoction jam and this sweet frosting butter mix, if you will. I've had beignets before, I lived in New Orleans for a little and was spoiled by the Cafe du Monde's of the gulf. These were delicious. A fresh take on a French classic, well worth it. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which was delicious and was sided with some grilled potatoes and onions. I ordered the Downtown Benedict which had turkey bacon and fresh as can be spinach and tomatoes accompanied with just the right amount of hollandaise on top. Mine was sided with those scrumptious potatoes and onions as well. The portions were extremely generous for the price, I was stuffed. The food was amazing and I can't complain about anything.   The vibe was great there, the music playing ahead was perfect. From John Mayer to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole soothing our ears. But before we could get to attached, a local artist named Sabrielle (someone please message me if they can correct me on this or where I can purchase her music) performed live. Her voice was amazing and kind of sold it for us. Apparently she's there every other Sunday so if you're lucky enough, she's gonna be famous one day.   All in all, go eat at eat. It's a great place to go and I'd recommend this to anyone. You won't be disappointed.",

Typically the first week a restaurant is open can be a bad time to visit, but not at EAT. They had it together. The service, food, atmosphere and proximity to everything fun downtown will lead to its success. Really great job Natalie and co. on launching a True epicurean gem in downtown.",

    "text": "Stopped off here before we headed to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North which is very close by.    It's sort of in this strange neighborhood and there were barely any cars around.  However, when you get inside, this place is packed and bustling.    We ended up sitting at the bar, which was great!  Everyone was very nice to us and we had great service during our entire meal.   My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak which is ginormous.  You can probably feed about 2-3 people with that dish.  It was heavy but yummy!    I ordered the oatmeal to be healthy and it was huge!  Portion sizes seem to be pretty large here.  It was really good as it was topped with some cinnamon roasted apples.  I didn't have to sweeten the oatmeal at all because it was so good.   My friend ordered pancakes which were amazing!  The pancakes were light and fluffy and just delicious!  It's on my list to order next time.    We also ordered the beignets which I was slightly disappointed about.  I think I've had the ones at Disneyland way too much and nothing can come close to those.  These were decent but just not how I like them which are soft and just melt in your mouth yummy with all the powdered sugar on top.   There are a ton of other things I want to try on their menu but since I don't live in Las Vegas it looks like I would only be able to eat here whenever we go to the outlets.  It's now on my must stop list for Vegas.   I also loved their wheat toast!!  You must be thinking that toast is toast but here the toast is fresh, light, fluffy and thick and it's toasted on their griddle.  One word to describe it ... Yummy.  If you like toast, you have to try that here.     You have to come with an empty stomach because you will leave completely full.  Great stop for lunch or brunch!!!",

I have a pretty adventurous palate but the huevos montelunos was a cacophony of sauces and it ended up tasting like nothing in particular. The truffled egg sandwich which was good, but nothing special.   Another thing I've noticed about this place is it seems everything is difficult to eat, making it impossible to get one bite that has all intended flavors in it; it ends up distracting from the meal. The coffee is fantastic and the quality of ingredients are great, but it just doesn't live up to the hype.",

    "text": "Me, my husband and my best friend went to have breakfast on Monday morning.  I was very excited about this place. Former chef from Casino, New downtown restaurant and cool interior....   Yes It is located at very weird area...you don't want to hang out on the street near the Eat. after dark. Only serving breakfast and lunch is a great idea. I don't want to be there at night time. Anyway we found the restaurant without any problem with my navi. But I didn't have any Quarters for the parking. I went inside and asked for some change.  Restaurant was beautiful. Very hip, great vibe and cool California style...felt like i was at Santa Monica somewhere not in downtown LV. My friend ordered Smoked Salmon, my husband ordered Shrimp and Grits and a side of pancakes, and I ordered Truffled Egg Sandwich.  Maybe our expectation was TOO high. Maybe Chef wasn't there when we were there. Sorry...every dish was nothing special... First of all Smoked salmon dish was just serving cream cheese, capers, sliced tomatoes, red onion and rye bread. My truffled egg sandwich...I can make better one at home. And my husband's Shrimp and Grits were the worst I've ever had. Shrimp wasn't season enough and the Grits were not season at all...not even salt. And coffee was luke warm. Staff was very nice and I loved the atmosphere.  But when you pay for $65($55for food and coffee+$10 for tip) for breakfast for 3 people. I'm expecting more than just serving store bought smoked salmon with cream cheese. I will give the chef credit, because they do use high quality products. We want to see more than pretty presentation and hip dining space. The food need more flavor for that price. But we will give them another shot.",

I gave it another chance because I wanted to let it settle in for a bit and see if it got better..  Bottom line is, if you're coming here with a friend you guys better rock paper scissors before you go inside on who's going to pay the tab, but then again, why go here when there are so many other places you can go??

    "text": "With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown Vegas, it's with much excitement that we ventured our way to it's newest arrival, Eat.  From what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.  As the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....  And as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...  We're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...  We were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!  And we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!  Well, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!  I came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!  I relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...  By our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.  We also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....  And as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!  Ratings (Out of FiveStars) Food:           5 Service:       5 Ambience:   5  PERFECT SCORE!!!",

The service was great, the restaurant was very clean and in a good location- We then visited Container Park and walk around Downtown.

They master the poached egg. I usually get poached or sunny side ^. I've been wanting to try the pancakes but can't get away from the chicken fried goodness.

    "text": "You wouldn't expect Rex Marvin to know about renaissance. Why is that? Because you know Rex. You know the Rex that considers swallowing the throw up in a strangers mouth after a night of drinking to be \"Rex's hair of the dog.\"  You're welcome, by the way...no one ever says thank you. It is just a stunned look, screaming and then deep guttural sobbing.  Rex gives the greatest gift you can ask for and this is the way your react...babies.  You know Rex...the Rex that after an underground dog race will gladly spit shine his blade before cutting off the back of a deadbeat's neck skin. Not the front. Not with a dirty blade. No. The back so he can grow a mullet, and spit shine so the blade looks clean...but we know isn't.  You know the Rex that when first showed the world how to Twerk during a gasoline soaked meth seizure...Rex means pre-planned dance move done half naked on fire in the parking lot of a Smith's while screaming his patented twerk anthem \"dear God just let Rex die!\"  You know...THAT Rex.  For some reason the small minded of you don't see that as a renaissance man.  To all of you that feel that way, prepare to feel that way with no back neck skin, MUTANTS!!!  Well, Rex is clearly a man who knows about renaissance and he can see the renaissance happening in his beloved Downtown.  A place that has given Rex the best experiences that resulted in crabs, losing a kidney, or being beaten mercilessly by a midget pimp holding an oversized bust of Gabe Kaplan.  Oh, the memories.  As much as Rex looks back on those fondly, he is excited about the changes taking place Downtown.  Gone are some of the crack houses, crack ho's and crack...now is some crack mixed with good places to eat and sleep.  One great place to eat...is eat. \"eat.\"  Terrible bad name that is not clever or interesting, but please don't let that misstep deter you from going forth and trying this wonderful little place. (Going forth? Last time I huff paint and read Chaucer...but in all fairness...it is the only way to read Chaucer.)    Eat. Is a revelation.  It is a wonderful little breakfast/lunch spot.  If you can forgive that hipster, desperately trying to be Seattle or if not Seattle, Portland...and if not Portland...a good attempt at Portland in Dayton Ohio...then yes...it is very, very good.  Rex, like all thinking humans, hates hipsters and hipster culture. So at first when you see the tattoos and the trying too hard without looking like trying too hard hipness of the place you want to vomit wildly while gurgling \"You are our disco!!\"  Please refrain. They mean you no harm. They are just misguided. Also, the food is damn good. So, Rex has eaten several times and will eat there again...but just for breakfast. Breakfast is way better than their lunch menu.  Stars of the breakfast...first and foremost one of the most interesting and delightful dishes of all time (yes, Rex punched himself in the balls for typing delightful), is the huevos motulenos. Odd collection of things that should not work but do...very, very well.  The second best was the shrimp and grits. Might be the best grits in Las Vegas. The pancakes are excellent and the chicken fried steak is the size of a bread plate and wonderfully tender and crispy.  The oatmeal was not great, I would not recommend.  Lunch was good, but not great. The salads seem out of place and Rex has heard more than one person say they are just \"okay\". Lose them. This isn't a salad place. The grilled cheese was not \"killer\" except if you mean it killed my belief it was a great grilled cheese. The version of the blt was good, but nothing exceptional. The Rueben was good, but nothing to write home about.    One last thing...Rex wanted coffee one morning...the coffee maker was broken! Travesty that must be avoided. He heard some dumb bastard try to order ginger ale with breakfast and he wanted to hit that guy in the face with his decent orange juice glass.  He didn't Rex IS a renaissance man...which is why his ho's always walk the cobblestone streets and bring back ducats from their \"dates.\"",

The breading had a flavorful spice mix and the gravy was uniquely delicious. They were served with two eggs, a mountain of potatoes and enormous pieces of toast. The bacon was thick cut, done just right with a bit of smokey flavor. Also the coffee was good. Definitely a cut above your standard diner coffee. My second time here I had the corned beef hash. It was also served with giant toast and two perfectly poached eggs. It wasn't as good as the chicken fried steak, but is still a good if plain corned beef hash. The staff was friendly, funny and efficient. Overall an awesome breakfast spot! I look forward to coming back next time I'm hungover in Vegas!",

    "text": "I was in town for a little vacation from LA. I wanted to venture off the strip to the up and coming hipster businesses in Tony Hsieh's downtown. I found out about this place from Yelp and trusted that this would be a great foodie experience. The food was A++++! I would return if I lived in Vegas. The area around the place is hella sketch, but the restaurant itself is nice and hip. Now, let's get back to the food. I was disappointed that I didn't come early enough for brunch, however, lunch was fantastic. Me and my tablemates had the chicken pot pie, grilled cheese sandwich, and shrimp po boy. Service was good as our server did his best to get the weak coffee remade for better coffee. I'm excited to see what downtown has to offer when I visit Vegas again.",

We found this place on Yelp and after reading some great reviews, decided to try it out the morning we were heading out of town.  What a great spot!  Its hip, has a great vibe, awesome decor (super simple, a little industrial, very clean) and very friendly staff. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. I ordered the egg white frittata which was super light, fluffy, full of delicious spinach, basil, and just the right amount of feta and kalamata olives.  My friends ordered the shrimp and grits which were heavenly and the Huevos Motulenos which was hearty and delicious with a red sauce reminiscent of mole.  Prices are very reasonable and the high quality of the ingredients is evident.  I wish this place existed in Seattle. I'll definitely visit eat the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "The plan was to have lunch at Eat after visiting the Downtown Farmers Market. However the market did not take very long and we arrived at Eat before the lunch period starts, which is 11 AM. So it was breakfast. The diners seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists that ventured the 2 blocks east of the downtown hotels.  We were seated immediately and ordered coffee. The coffee arrived after a short wait and upon arrival our server thanked us for our patience beause the coffee was being brewed fresh. It was worth the short wait. The menu is interesting and has many inviting choices. I decided on the Chilaquiles which was excellent. This may be a new breakfast item as I have not seen it reviewed. The plate starts wich a layer of corn tortilla chips, covered with melted cheese and red & green chiles topped with scrambled eggs, a jalapeno sausage and pico de gallo. Believe the menu as it says the dish is spicy. Just the right of heat in the sausage for my taste. This breakfast is a winner!  My wife had an order of Beignets which she enjoyed very much. The dough is heavier than others such as Cafe Du Monde but still tasty. Looking forward to trying lunch.  Finding parking on the street at a meter was not a problem probably since it was mid morning. There are several empty lots across the street, north and west that are under development.  A parking lot for this neighborhood  would be a plus.",

I also thought it was overpriced at $15.00, considering the amount of prime rib I got (tiny cut up pieces also). At $10 I probably wouldn't complain. Service was good and the staff was friendly, but one thing I noticed was that the cooks pre-prepare a lot of their food, probably in anticipation for the crowds? I saw stacks of pre-cooked bacon, potatoes, biscuits, etc., which leads me to believe that the food isn't as freshly made as you would think. Maybe this is the norm everywhere, but I just happened to notice that here.  Other than that, I kind of regret my choice for breakfast and wish I had opted for something else...like the shrimp and grits. May return, but while on vacation, probably won't.  Additional note, the coffee was also kinda pricey.",

The Huevos Motulenos is by far one of THE best breakfast dishes I've ever taste. A little sweet, a little savory, and a little spicy. What a delicious combination. The ingredients are listed as: Two eggs over easy with red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta and sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. Wow, seriously, I could probably eat this every morning.   I enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant is small, cozy, and simple. It's very comfortable and my two year old enjoyed being there. I definitely plan on making a return visit.",

    "text": "This popular, new DT nook reminds me of a trendy NYC brunch hangout. It's not so much the food or the decor that causes me to reminisce, it's the fact that this place has limited seating, excess patrons, and folks will wait a long time for a table even though there are other good restaurants within walking distance.  If you're dining alone, you can plant yourself at the counter almost immediately. If you're with a group. The wait can be as long as 45 mins, and unlike Hash-House-a-Go-Go, which also always has a long wait, they don't have a pager to give you and you can't just sashay up to the bar while you wait for a table.  I will tell you, these guys really care about their customers.  When I received my Downtown Benedict (one of their signature dishes) I found that the poached eggs were hard boiled.  I didn't even complain, but the manager noticed a look of disappoint on my face and rushed in and had the dish re-fired.  The Benedict was not bad. I picked up a slightly off-putting vinegar flavor from it.  There was probably too much vinegar in the poaching liquor.  The side of skillet-grilled potatoes was pretty good (fresh not frozen). Hollandaise sauce had a smooth, creamy texture. All ingredients tasted fresh, and the plating and presentation was, as I like to say, \"pretty.\"   I would recommend Eat. It may not blow you away, but it's a decent breakfast haven.  Just be aware of the wait and the noise.",

    "text": "I went to Eat for the first time recently and enjoyed a great lunch. Excellent, Awesome, and Terrific, would be a good mnemonic device to remember this wonderful restaurant. Here are three reasons why I liked the place so much:  1) The food was EXCELLENT! I had the Banh Mi Sandwich with tofu and seasonal slaw on a baguette, served with a pickle spear and potato salad. The tofu was firm and slightly crispy, the slaw fresh and full of flavor, and the baguette soaked up the sandwich's delicious sauces without becoming soggy or mushy. I prefer a mustard-based potato salad, but the traditional one that came with my meal was a-ok. Tangent: I think it's cute that the menu describes the additional side as \"a really good pickle.\" Really! Overall, the meal filled me up without leaving me feeling bloated or gross--- perfect lunch portions! I ate every last bite!  2) The staff was AWESOME. It appeared as though the owner and/or head chef was present, seated towards the side/back of the restaurant, close to where we were eating. (This might have been a contributing factor to the good service, but whatevs.) I always appreciate when owners/chefs are visibly present in the restaurant. To me, it speaks volumes and shows they actually care about their patrons, the food, and the community. Thanks for that!  3) The restaurant looked TERRIFIC. It was exceptionally clean and also well decorated. I loved the variety of high tables and regular tables, make it perfect for groups, a business lunch, or a romantic meal. Side note: I went on a Friday at about 1:00 pm, and although I didn't have to wait for a table, the place was BUSY. I wouldn't be surprised if there are normally wait times, so plan ahead.  Eat was E-xcellent, A-wesome, and T-errific. A good name for a good restaurant! I'll definitely have to return for breakfast.",

It was amazing. So freaking good. Potatoes it came with were very good too. we also had a free range chicken sandwich which was very good. The table next to us got a stack of pancakes which looked amazing. I will have to try them next time. It was refreshing to get off the strip and this was a nice trendy new restaurant in old town Las Vegas. The owner was outside when we arrived. She is very friendly.

I wanted to see what the buzz was about, too, so myself and a friend showed up last Friday at 7:00am, eager to get our breakfast Eat on and....it was closed.  Both the Eat website and Yelp have the hours as opening at 7:00am Monday through Fridays, but that is no longer True as we discovered.  The new opening time is 8:00am.  Disappointed to say the least, we settled on DuPar's for pancakes--it's nice to have a backup downtown!  Round 2:  we showed up today at 8:00am and they were open for business--yes!  Both the beignets and the pancakes looked tempting, but I wanted to try something not sweet for once, so I went with the Shrimp and Grits with bacon.  Our waitress described it as being served in a big bowl with the bacon strips, then the grits, 3 big shrimp, topped by pico de gallo--that's what I got and it was GOOD!  I never eat something so heavy for breakfast, but I liked the combination, being sure to get each part of the dish in each spoonful--very creative and delicious.  I tried my friend's dish, the Huevos Motulenos, which I didn't order only because I don't do spicy food.  If you have the spicy gene, you should order it; I had a bite and it was also delish.  Service was excellent and the space itself is very comfy and clean.  I love having places like this springing up Downtown.  I'll definitely be back for lunch and to try the beignets--just please update the business hours so others don't show up at 7:00am and walk away, sad and hungry.",

It was a big portion, which seemed it would be worth the price, however, the shrimps were NOT fresh. You could tell, because when you put them in your mouth, you taste salty water. It seems that the shrimps were defrosted, but not all the way. It was gross. I don't think the shrimp and grits would've been that bad if the shrimps were fresh. The shrimps is what killed it for me. Overall, the dish is a 2 out of 5.  The pancakes, however, is a 5 out of 5. They're the BOMB(dot)COM. If you're going to eat., get the PANCAKES. Screw the shrimp and grits. The pancakes are worth the drive.  I guess another aspect I didn't like about eat., is that I felt rushed eating. They seemed eager for us to finish our meal, which killed the experience.",

I would say it gave off the vibe of a trendy spot in Melrose.  There were cool, huge black and white photos hung on the walls.  Our waitress was really nice and suggested a few items off their menu. I really wanted to have their breakfast menu but we missed it, since they stop serving it at 11am.    Anyways, I got the veggie bahn mai with a side of potato salad and my friend and I split their black bean chili.  The baguette was so deliciously buttery and crispy at the edges and the veggies was served in sort of like a slaw: 4/5. The soup was ok. I kinda wish it was a little spicier and it also came out a little cold: 3/5. I also liked the fact that they carried organic juices.  The location of this spot blows my mind, because I'm always in this area but never knew this place was here.  I probably never noticed it because I'm usually downtown at night.  I'll definitely have to make a morning trip down here soon so I can try their breakfast menu.",

Hubby got the truffled egg sandwich and I got the shrimp po boy. We started with the fried deviled eggs on the suggestion from the server.   So the deviled eggs set the bar high. They were super yummy. If you are asking how you fry a deviled egg...they bread the hard boiled egg white and fry it and top it with yummy yolky filling. Drizzle a lil sriracha on top and BAM!  The truffled egg sandwich was good but nothing amazing. It comes with mushrooms which were pretty much non existent.Truffle flavor?? Bacon was on the chewier side which can be troublesome in a sandwich.  A decent breakfast sandwich but not worth the $12.   Shrimp Po Boy was also alright. The best part was probably the slaw. Shrimp were fresh. The ciabatta was on the chewier side and probably could of been toasted more. Potato salad on the side was nothing special.   Service was on point. We were greeted and sat immediately. Food, drinks and check were timely.",

    "text": "I eat, so I went to eat to eat. After doing some business at 200 Lewis avenue at 8am I was hungry and looked for a place to eat downtown, yes there are many casinos with restaurants around but I didn't feel like going into a casino, besides the traffic court had already beaten them to my money.   As I was driving away from the renovated areas of downtown into the more shady areas, I spotted this little place in the corner of Carson and seven street known for other kind of activities, so I was surprised to find a restaurant there.  I parked my car  and searched for quarters under the seat of my car for the parking meter, luckily I hadn't  cleaned my car for months so I found enough change for parking, for breakfast, and even for the bum asking for change.   The restaurant is located at the corner of an old budget apartment building, but don't let that scare you because once you walk in you'll forget the world outside and be absorbed into a new, clean, modern, cool dinning experience. The place is small and popular so sometimes you'll be forced to share a table with other people, but not to worry, they won't bite, they have good food on their plate.   By recommendation of the waiter I went with the huevos motulenos, two eggs over easy covered with red and green sauce with melted cheese on top of corn tortillas. The only other place I had this is in Mexico and I cannot tell you how good this is, you have to try it for yourself and do your own sweating. you'll be coming back for more.  They only serve breakfast and lunch and that is a good call, you don't want to be caught in this area after sunset. It all turns into a different kind of venture, you'll become the main course so you better fly like a moth towards the Fremont street experience lights, unless you're looking for something else,..in that case, ask for Lola...now that's five stars! (I heard)   Good food Great service Great atmosphere Very clean  I'll be back to eat...to eat.",

The tortilla stack was half covered with green sauce (just spicy enough) and 1/2 red sauce (almost a mole flavor). The chive potatoes were crispy with just the right touch of crispy spices on the skins.  My husband had truffle egg sandwich. The bacon was perfect (which is rare in restaurants). The sandwich was light with a delicious combination of tastes. Also served with the chive potatoes. It has a small out door tree covered sitting area. My only complaint is the beautiful inside does echo a lot - not good for conversation. I will be back!",

It's bigger than what it looks outside and super cozy. The service was good - didn't need to be managed. The portion was good value, it did take a little while for the food to be served, but coming from Brunch City, Portland, I was used to the wait. Sit, enjoy the company and wait for the magic to appear.   I would try again. And if you were a newbie - I would definitely recommend to try.",

I don't like salty food, zero salt tastes chalky.  My mom had the chicken fried steak. The potatoes were burnt, not overdone, black on one side and the oil tasted old that the meat was fried. Not a cheap outing at $15 and up for each plate. The server took away my mom's toast before she could halt her, but said \"take your time\". It was also incredibly loud. Crazy loud. The cement floors and arrangement made it impossible to talk to each other without yelling.",

This unnecessarily loud (due to the not-so-background music) is overwhelmingly disappointing.  For what you get, the prices are some $2-$5 more than they really should be.  $13 for a nearly flavorless Reuben sandwich that was more bread than anything else is such a rip off that it's insulting.  I mentioned it to my waiter and a lady came by the table and took it away, leaving me nothing to eat.  That really made me angry.  I'd rather eat a bad sandwich than nothing at all.  My wife's corned beef hash (which is grossly overpriced at somewhere around $12-$14) wasn't anything special at all, though she did like the green onions that were in it.  With how empty this restaurant is at lunch time it's no surprise they have to charge so much.  Any less and they'd probably go out of business.  Then again, were that to happen I wouldn't miss them.  Not coming back.  Ever.  It's a horrible restaurant with some bad people working there.",

The ambience is pretty cool, industrial meets whimsical. The menu looked promising- lots to choose from. I neeeded to try the shrimp and grits. They feature mothership coffee #WIN, and provided water too. They didn't provide any of their cool paper straws to us. My sister got the tofu scramble with chive potatoes. She really liked her food. Our friend ordered pancakes with the sausage. I had some of hers, and they were crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside. My dish was okay. The grits weren't flavored and the eggs were supposed to be cooked over easy- it was more like medium. The shrimp were few and weren't seasoned. Maybe I'll try something less ambitious on the menu. The service was a bit lackluster too. If we weren't seated by the cart full of supplies (straws, hot sauce etc.) then we would've been waiting on condiments for a while. Again, maybe we'll try again and I'll update this cute local restaurant agin with more positive words.",

But when my trust worthy yelp contact in Sin city highly recommended this place,  our trip became a memorable one indeed.   Located in sketchy downtown, sits this corner restaurant surrounded with motels and run down apartments.  Meter street parking for $1/hr was a treat compared to California rates.   Anyway, we were greeted fairly welcoming on a busy mid week peaking breakfast hour. We were seated right away.  And our server was pleasant and helpful in explaining their specials.   We went with what we were craving. Screw the reviews, everything looked and sounded so good on paper.  We had their steel cut oatmeal sprinkled with cinnamon apple slices and walnuts. Sooooo good! Yes. Trying to be healthy here:)   He had to order the chicken fried steak with gravy. May be not so healthy but actually very good. Cooked tender inside and a nice bite into the bird. Yum yum gravy btw! Right amount of light gravy and not thick just the way he likes it.   I also ordered their pancakes. Straight up traditional pancakes.  And OMG! The BEST pancake i have ever tasted. It's fluffy in the middle and a little crusted on the edge and i can completely taste that battered pancake flavor. Love it!!! Definitely an oldie and oh such a goodie!  Thank God they give huge portions! Because i ate it all!!!   Eat will definitely be one of our MUST eat  next time we fly to LV again!   # falling # in # love # again!",

I chose the skinny Jenny salad with a 'pounded marinated chicken breast, arugala, red onions, cherry tomatoes, parmesan-reggiano and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\" Sounds good right? Well the chicken breast was pounded into a leather-like tortilla under a mountain of arugula, and a smidgeon of both red onions and cherry tomatoes that must have been thrown on from a great height. I laboriously ate just a few very chewy bites of the chicken, which was tasteless. I told the waitress as she cleared the plates that I didn't care for it.  Rather than ask me what it was I didn't like, she offered to bring me something else. I declined her offer and that was it. No adjustment to my bill. Nothing.  No more EAT for me!",

The potatoes were a tad over cooked and chewy but the flavor was good. The pancake was average. A bit too fluffy for my taste.   Now the bad. I'm a stickler for hygiene. Noted the food handling in one of the prep areas was done without gloves. I hope the staff washed their hands but you never know. Hepatitis is not something I'd like to get with my meal.",

Truffled egg sandwich was amazing ... nothing to complain about here, perfect portion for the price and very flavorful.  My fiance ordered shrimp and grits I wished it had a little more seasoning to it which I just added cholula to it to kick it up a bit.  It was a little too \"tomatoey\" to me like a ceviche salsa, but maybe that's what they're going for ... if so you guys did ... nailed it.  The pancakes were a perfect blend of fluffy and crispy ... not burnt.   We enjoyed the food and no complaints about the service.    The only thing I dislike is you have to pay to park.  Being spoiled in Las Vegas usually you can find free parking somewhere, but for this location it would be quite a walk to find that.  So be aware, since this restaurant isn't too large you might need to put a few more quarters or dollars in your meter when they get packed.",

    "text": "We visited eat. on Sunday 04/19/15 around 12:30 for Brunch and easily found parking in the pay lot across from Container Park (a short block from eat.).  We must have come at a good time because we only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to be cleaned before we were seated.  The restaurant is bright and inviting, and our corner 1/2 booth was very comfortable.  We ordered drinks after about 5 minutes and our server was back to take our order a few minutes later.  We ordered a few things to try and share.  Huevos Motulenos ($12) Two eggs over easy on top of red & green New Mexican chili, black beans, peas, feta, sauteed bananas, all on a corn tortilla w/ a side of chive potatoes.  I 86'ed the feta due to an allergy.  The portion is huge!  All of these ingredients seemed like such a bizarre combination that I had to try it.  When you cut into the egg and it runs over the beans, chili, and banana, the flavor profile is amazing.  The sweetness of the banana is so unexpected when mixed with all the savory flavors.  Truly a unique dish that I did not want to stop enjoying.  The potatoes were also really good, but largely forsaken in lieu of the main dish.  Downtown Eggs Benedict ($13) This is an off menu item, but I gather from what I've heard that it's available every weekend even though it's not listed.  This benedict is made up of turkey bacon, sauteed spinach, a slice of tomato, poached egg covered in hollandaise, all stacked on a wheat English muffin.  This may be one of the best bennies ever we've ever tried.  The hollandaise was definitely at the top of the list.  This dish was accompanied by a couple strawberries and the same fantastic breakfast potatoes.  Single pancake ($3)  I am always on the lookout for the perfect pancake. While Du-Par's definitely wins this contest hands down, the pancake at eat. was very good and almost dessert like because it was dusted with confectioners sugar.  Fluffy with slightly crispy edges, this pancake would make my top 10 list.  Since it was already covered in sugar, we didn't crack open the little glass jar of maple syrup.",

    "text": "This place reminded me of Carson's Kitchen, which is right down the road, except I liked this place better. Unfortunately I wasn't quite into \"Yelping\" as much back in December when I went there.   Anyway, I went in with my coworkers - we were a group of six - and we only waited about five minutes to be seated. My coworker and I split the made-to-order beignets with seasonal jam & vanilla-scented mascarpone ($8). Anyone who knows me knows that I am usually against mixing fruit with food (yogurt parfaits, orange-infused anything, etc.) - the only thing I usually like is toast with jam. So honestly I was a bit worried about this because it was topped with berries, but I devoured it haha. The beignets were definitely made to order; fresh, fluffy, and cooked just right. The mascarpone wasn't too sweet or too thick. It had the texture of slightly melted jelly.  As an entree I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy (sauteed shrimp, shredded napa cabbage, seasonal winter veggies & Tabasco mayo on ciabatta - $13). It had a good amount of spice on it though I could've handled more. The shrimp was fresh, the cabbage was perfect, and I usually do not like sweet pickles but they worked on this sandwich. All sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, with a pickle. I opted for the chips and they were some of the best I've had. They had the flakiness and crispness of a lay's chip, except cooked better and minus all the greasiness.   So, all together we ordered three \"appetizers,\" six entrees, two coffees and a tea for a total of $112. That's not bad considering it's only $20/person. We got less at Carson's Kitchen yet spent more.  I will definitely be returning here. The staff was also very attentive and quick. I'm looking forward to my next trip here!",

Eggs Benedict had a nice, tangy hollandaise sauce that was balanced with a tomato slice, served also with thin slices of turkey and spinach. Side note: love watching the egg yolk drip down when it's cut into. Can never get enough of #yolkporn, amiright?   My truffle egg sandwich was heavenly. When you think about it, sometimes the hardest dishes to get right are the most common ones. Who hasn't had a million egg sandwiches already? Yet every aspect of their egg sandwich was on point. Crispy but soft bread, yummy buttery scrambled eggs, bacon, & mushrooms were all so individually good. It's making me drool right now!   The shrimp n grits harkened back to my North Carolina days. It was served with bacon, and two over medium eggs (but looked more like over easy eggs). If I had one complaint it would be the slightly undercooked eggs.   Two of the dishes came with roasted potatoes that had crispy skin dusted with a cheese-dust/powder.   We sat outside, had our coffee, and got there early enough where we didn't need to wait (8:30 on a Sunday, and it was filling up fast). The staff was super friendly too, and it was an enjoyable and relaxing experience.   If you drive there, free parking is available at the parking deck one block down from the restaurant.",

The bread was buttery and toasted nicely, but the sandwich was mostly bread. Half the plate was potatoes which were okay, but I'm not a fan of potatoes.  Corned Beef Hash $14 - Also good, but nothing mind blowing. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly and the sourdough was yummy and soft.  SERVICE Our server seemed like he was in a rush and wasn't happy to be there. He almost forgot to introduce himself and basically just asked us what we wanted.  OVERALL Not sure if I would come here again... The food is pretty overpriced and it wasn't anything spectacular. Plus the location is near Fremont Street and it's out of the way if you're staying on the Strip.",

    "text": "When I lived in Vegas EAT always had a line out of the door whenever we wanted brunch. Luckily at the time Glutton was still open and my favorite and across the street so I never went hungry. I now live in Cali and was in Vegas for a long weekend and wanted something good to eat before we got on the road. I want to start off by saying the food was mediocre which I did not expect at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was bland. The grits were not salted or seasoned which brought the flavor of everything else down. My husband got the pancakes which were not bad but they were just pancakes. The service was weird. We came in with our infant and were told we could not flip over the high chair for insurance reasons and from there it just seemed like our table was a nuisance. We were never asked if our food was to our liking or if we needed refills. Our check was dropped off before we were even half way done with our meal. And we were seated right by the waiters station so you would expect some level of attentiveness. In all fairness our initial waiter was nice but something about the manager on the floor was throwing off the energy. Twice I saw him reseat a table (including ours) and not in the most polite way. The nicest person in the restaurant worked in the kitchen. He had offered my husband half of his sandwich when he went to the car to get the stroller for our son and then came to our table to shake his hand. We should have just gone to Blueberry Hill.",

    "text": "Decided to make a trip downtown to check out the Container Park and thought  it would be a great time to finally try this much lauded eatery (8/3/14)!  It was 1 pm (an hour before they close) and raining outside and we were told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes.  I anticipated this, brought an umbrella, and my husband and his son ran down to check out the famous O-Face Donuts (win-win as I would now have three places checked off on my Yelp bucket list!).  Near the half-hour mark, the hostess came outside and told me it would not be much longer and offered the counter but I declined.  There was room to wait inside so I went in.  Two people came  in and they were almost immediately taken to a table (albeit by a different hostess/staff) which did irritate me as we were now hitting the 40 minute mark.  The other hostess returned and must have noticed what had occurred and told me we would have a table right away (and I did see her talk to the other server).    We sat down (with our O-Face donut loot ).  Our server came over and took our drink order.  He was friendly but he did appear to be slightly ready to be\" done\" (it was now very close to 2 pm) for the day (and I completely sympathize with that).  We quickly made up our minds; Killer grilled cheese with kick-ass tomato soup for moi; pancakes with bacon (a substitute for the apple-chicken sausage) for my step-son; corned beef hash for my husband.  It did not seem very long before our food was served but gave us time to take in the decor.  I loved it- especially the tall divider structure at the entrance with the plants (figuring out how to do that at home).   My husbands only minor (very minor) complaint was the chair that he sat in seemed to have a hollow cushion and it caused him to be seated at an awkward height (but it was worse when I sat in it as I'm much shorter!) but not enough to dampen his appetite or our total experience.  The food arrived and it looked wonderful.  My husband loved the corned beef hash (its his baseline food item order to which all places are measured by).  He determined it to be in 2nd place to Bagel Cafe (a very high compliment)- but it could be \"in the running\".  I enjoyed my grilled cheese very much but the soup slightly reminded me of marinara sauce (not necessarily a bad thing but I couldn't get that out of my mind). My step-son really liked his pancakes and bacon and could not finish it and offered us a bite.  THOSE PANCAKES!  Not sure what is in them but they were incredible!  I had to have another bite!    I'm not sure when we will venture out again( but I am dying to try on a week-day as the menu seems to slightly vary) but we definitely agreed that we would want to come back.  This is a place that every Las Vegan should try at least once!",

The bread literally melts in your mouth. I've also had the Huevos Motulenos which was okay. Service is always good. I love that you can see the open kitchen from the seating area as well. If you are going for brunch, be aware that they do not serve alcohol so mimosas in the morning, are not an option here. The owner and chef Natalie Young is fantastic and is opening another restaurant downtown. Can't wait! You can spot her overseeing the work in the kitchen or just hanging out on the bench outside.

I particularly like the deviled eggs. How could you go wrong with a deep fried deviled egg! My husband doesn't like normal deviled eggs but he would eat a whole plateful at EAT. The pancakes and chicken fried steak are also some of my favorites.  The service is horrible. I never thought the service would keep me from such a great restaurant but it will. I don't ever plan on returning to EAT because the service is just that bad. The wait is always long, so don't come here if you only have a few hours to spare. Once you are seated, it takes forever to get your drinks and order your food. I had to leave one time after I was seated because they were taking forever and I was going to be late to work if I stayed any longer. I also feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman when she is shopping on Rodeo Drive for the first time when I come to EAT. Everyone else seems to be getting star treatment except me. This has happened just about every time I have come.  Overall the food is good but I will probably not be returning because of the service is just horrible.",

If I could give it another half-star I probably would, but there are a few things that I have to consider:  Pros: awesome coffee in the mornings, nice atmosphere and decor, great homemade chips, delicious grilled-cheese sandwich, and a freaking amazing tofu banh mi (seriously...that was one of my favorite things there).  Cons: the \"spicy\" posole was disappointingly bland to my palette (perhaps an off-day?), the breakfast dish with the tortilla chips (name of which is escaping me and apparently the website is down so I can't check) was tasty but ultimately muddled in flavor.  Probably the most frustrating thing (and the one that still sticks in my craw) was the day I grabbed a salad to go. I got the spinach salad with aspragus and almonds, and decided to add some shrimp. I saw that the shrimp add-on was kind of spendy (~$4), and ultimately the salad cost me $18. When I got to the office I was disappointed to find a tiny salad and three tiny shrimp. That's more than $1/shrimp!   So yeah...ultimately, I like the food, I have my favorites, but I can't round up to 4 stars just yet. When I start working downtown again that may change (and I'll definitely go back), but being away from the area has taken the shine off my initial experiences.",

Sorry but that is horrible customer service.   When a customer walks in and is hungry and you tell them NO you can not sit there, you have to sit outside, you better believe I will never come back to this place.   If I recall correctly this was one of  Tony Hsieh 1st investments in the DT project. Great way to earn customers.   Oh and one last thing, the owner Natalie was just sitting back watching...  Do you ever wonder as an owner when 2 people walk into your establishment, and then walk out...why did they leave? Why didn't the hostess sit them down?   Why didn't you as an owner stand up, and say \"Hello, why did these people leave\"  Well now you know. #epicfail",

We waited about 20 mins for a table which isn't bad. The decor is really cool, modern, and has a good vibe.  Service is horrible. No one smiles or introduces themselves. A guy take our drink  order, a women comes takes our order. Neither of the servers are pleasant or friendly.  I let her know that I would like to order a sandwich to go toward the end of the meal. Food comes out quickly.  My friend got the grilled cheese with avocado. It's average. The passion ice tea is really good. My eggs Benedict is drowning in the hollandaise sauce. I can't even enjoy all the ingredient bc the sauce is taking over the plate. I look around and others have egg Benedict's who have a lot less sauce than us, and even strawberries in their plate!   The check is dropped while I'm still eating. Uncomfortable. I never get to order my sandwich to go bc the server honestly never really came back. Sure I could've got her attention but at this point i would take my business else where. The cherry on top is I asked if the orange juice was fresh squeezed. The guy tells me yes. I ordered a small and it's definitely not fresh squeezed. I am charged for a large. I don't even bother to correct the $6.00 mistake. I'm just so over it at this point.",

The food was delicious and I would have given this place 5 stars but my eggs had some runny whites. Over Medium is yolk runny, whites done. There is a close line on this and it is not too hard to get that right. The place was busy at 8:40 and they open at 8.   I definitely recommend this place. Have fun eating.",

Showed up at10:45 on a Saturday of holiday weekend and the wait for two was quoted at 20 minutes, but really we were seated in about 10-15.   Other reviewers mentioned that the chicken fried streak is only served until 11, however our server said it was available all day on their brunch menu. We had the chicken fried steak and the huevos montulenos. Each came with a hearty portion of country potatoes and the chicken fried steak came with toast. Do yourself a favor and ask for jelly. The strawberry jelly they brought was delicious and fresh. Both dishes were good and totally different so it's hard to pick a favorite between the two. I was surprised that I did enjoy the sweetness of the banana in the huevos montulenos. The banana and the peas are what made the dish unique.   Overall a good meal and I highly recommend.  Tip-the container park is right across the street and makes for a fun walk after your meal.",

I work downtown, and there are a few (very few) good places to eat in the area.  Container Park has a few, and right across the street from Container Park is eat.  It's convenient to our office, so this is what tends to entice a lot of us to pick something up.  eat is loud, always crowded, and fast-paced.  I do feel, however, that the food is a skitch overpriced.  I walked in on Tuesday (8/19) and was informed of a fabulous pulled pork sandwich special.  I agreed, but when she rang it up? $16.  $16? This pork sandwich better make me sing in the streets!  Overall, the food is good, but I think they hype lends itself to a little smidgen of price gouging.",

The cinnamon biscuits with fresh strawberries and blueberries were worth the price of admission! In fact a picture posted by another reviewer was my reason for selecting the restaurant. My boyfriend had chilaquiles: scrambled eggs with turkey jalapeno mango sausage, corn tortilla chips, red & green new mexico chile & pico de gallo, the eggs were, eggs but the combo of nachos and Mexican chile makes this dish anything but pedestrian! I had the amazing huevos motulenos: two eggs over-easy with red & green new 12 mexico chiles, black beans, peas, pico, feta & sauteed bananas on corn tortilla! Let's be clear, I am not a fan of runny eggs! This dish however, is delicious and amazing! It was spicy and sweet, that's the banana, I loved the blend of flavors! The bill came in at $43+ tip. A bit more than I would like to pay at breakfast, however, the portions were large and we did order the two most expensive entrees. Definitely worth a repeat visit!",

    "text": "This review is for eat.'s occasional fried chicken dinner, which only happens so often and requires advance payment and reservation.  Always intriguing when a classically trained chef like Natalie takes on traditional food, and eat's fried chicken dinner is no exception.  A promised all-you-can-eat fried chicken meal with all the traditional fixings for $38 (cash only).  It begins with homemade biscuits and cornbread, both warm as if only recently taken from the oven.  The biscuits are hearty, the cornbread perhaps too fluffy as it came apart very easily.  Both are accompanied by butter and artisan honey, which was a great dip for the biscuits (and the chicken skin as well).  The entree is a mix of fried chicken served alongside mashed potatoes, collard greens, cheddar mac and cheese, and corn on the cob.  The chicken is well-cooked, with a batter of a unique blend of spices (guessing paprika, a touch of pepper, seasoned salt, and some oregano-like herb).  The collards are tasty with a hint of pepper kick, the mac and cheese is no-frills made with tasty cheddar, and the corn is seasoned with paprika.  The mashed potatoes weren't all too memorable, but skipping that at least leaves more room for the chicken.  The meal is capped off by warm peach cobbler with a dollop of fresh cream on top.  Fresh peaches, warm from the oven, and the cream supplied a satisfying note that helped temper the heat and sweetness of the cobbler.  The vibe for these dinners is a friendly one, people introduce themselves and experience the food alongside each other.  Natalie makes the rounds herself in her traditional plaid shirt and chuck taylors, making for a real communal ambiance that's in short supply in this town.  You have to either visit regularly or follow eat. on Facebook to find out when the next one is, but once it's announced, get tickets and plan the diet accordingly.  This has to be one of the more unique dining experiences the already vibrant Vegas' dining scene provides.",

But there were several issues during our meal that made this place miss the 4 star level.  One place they excel: the pancake. It's thick and fluffy, while still being crispy on the outside. I rarely order pancakes, but after two bites, I was hooked.  The homemade tomato soup was quite good, with large, thin chunks or parmesan floating on top. Also, the coffee served here is excellent.  We also tried the truffled egg sandwich. I've seen other reviewers rave about this, but something was missing. The bread wasn't good, and the flavors of the ingredients didn't meld well together.   The service here was lacking.  It seems to be focused on turnover rather than True customer interaction. Our server asked us about five times if we were ready to order.  Once we were finished, three different people asked if we wanted the check.  We weren't checked on a single time while dining.   Lastly, the name is kind of dumb: \"Hey, you want to go eat?\"  \"Sure, what are you thinking?\" \"How about eat?\" \"....I know, like, what place\" \"No...the restaurant in downtown called eat, silly\" \"...\"  Bottom Line: A fine brunch/lunch spot, and certainly better than a lot of other Las Vegas spot. They serve brunch daily, which is really nice if you are visiting and everyday seems like a Saturday.  Maybe I went on an off day, but this place is already good and has potential to get better.",

It gets crowded really quick and the noise is sometimes a bit much but the food makes up for it. Everything is prepared properly and tastes fresh.  Whenever company comes from out-of-town I make sure to take them here. Highly recommend!",

Very contemporary and we stopped by Pawn Stars on the way back to our hotel. I also like that they have the same type of bread in whole wheat if requested.  The only downfall of this place was that it felt very rushed... they gave us a bill 2 minutes after we got our food and kept asking if we wanted a bag.  We are not slow eaters (from NYC) and like to do things at an accelerated pace, but this felt like they were trying to get rid of us a bit.    I got the truffle egg sandwich and it was great! I asked for a side of chipotle mayo to make it a bit creamier-- it was excellent.",

Pronouncing beignets a handful of ways is apparently amusing to me. Then years later this became mine & my boyfriends breakfast spot, and I thought maybe it wasn't so bad after all. After coming a few times solo, I think the only reason I really enjoy(ed) it is because of the experience and memories with boyfriend/friends.   Today I sat up at the bar and ordered breakfast. After that, my server didn't come back for the rest of the meal. Someone working the expo dropped off my food, checked on me and refilled my coffee, and at the end of my meal after the expo guy cleared my plates, my original server came by and said \"You still haven't gotten your breakfast yet?\"  -_-.   I think what made the experience even more lackluster was that all of the food was cold. The bacon, the potatoes, and the eggs. I never ever ever send food back, so I just ate it and left.   I think this place will be near and dear to my heart, but it won't be a place I come to more than once a year.",

The biscuits had a slightly crunch on the outside (which I liked) and weren't too dense on the inside (which I also liked). Covered in strawberries, blueberries and strawberry compote, not too sweet, but just right.   I had the truffle egg sandwich which was delightful. Bread toasted perfectly, filled with eggs flavored with truffle, bacon, and feta - yum, yum and yum! It came with a side of potatoes and onions. I ate half and I was stuffed!  My hubby had the pancakes which were fluffy and oh so good. It came with a side of turkey sausage that was flavorful and delicious.  The only downside is location. We usually don't go downtown very often and parking is all on the street, metered. Also, after reading other reviews, we got lucky and didn't have to wait (Sunday at 11am) but I can imagine it's not often like that.",

Instead the waitress tried to push some unappealing truffle breakfast sandwich on us. Also, the waitress and menu were very clear about \"NO ALTERATIONS TO ANY DISH ON THE MENU\"...so don't dare ask the waitress to customize anything they cook.

I loved the perfect texture of my eggs, the veggie additions, and truffle taste that wasn't overpowering. Hubby tried the shrimp po boy which had a banh mi kick to it! It was very fresh and delicious. We sampled their deviled eggs which were deep fried with sriracha on top -- I have to say they were the best deviled eggs I've ever had!   Hubby had their passion tea and I had the sparkling strawberry lemonade which was pretty amazing.  Gary was our server and he was very in tune to hearing what we were deciding on and also with making recommendations since it was our first visit!   We definitely liked the ambiance - casual and quaint - and want to come back!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Eat., but alas these hopes were dashed.   I came here on a Sunday morning during normal busy brunching hours. I get it, it's a popular time to eat, but I what I don't get is waiting 25 minutes to seated then having to wait another 10 minutes before we even get to meet out server for the morning. Thirty five minutes in total waiting and all I have received is a cup of water and some coffee. Personally, I would avoid Eat. on Sundays for brunch, because this place gets packed!  I suggested this place to some friends and family after reading a few Eat's reviews, for the most part they have good reviews with a few minor hiccups along the way. We arrived and after studying the menu for the past half hour we were finally able to sit down. The hostess took us to our table and almost immediately we were greeted with waters and a notification that out server would be right back to help us... fast forward to us looking at the menu for the 7th time and wondering when/if our bellies would ever get full on this beautiful Sunday morning, out of nowhere our server finally appears pen and paper in hand. After a few quick menu questions and our table having to explain to our server what a Frittata is, our food order was put in and breakfast was on it's way.   FOOD TIME: As a group we ordered the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. These were ok, the cinnamon flavor was lacking and the biscuit fell apart at every turn, but the compote was quite delicious and I found myself going back for more.     I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. First off this had a beautiful presentation, the way the food was laid on the plate was fantastic and really made me want to dive right in. This order comes with two huge bacon strips, two over medium eggs, two fairly large butterflied shrimp, all placed on a mound of grits. This meal was ok, it had good flavor, but needed a just a kick of spice on the back end. Also it arrived cold. Which I thought was weird because I was the last person at our table to get my food.   During our meal a few things were definitely noted...   - Our server was M.I.A., we didn't see her again until the check was dropped.  - The server or food runner forgot to bring out one of our diners toast. Since our server had disappeared. We asked the hostess for assistance and she quickly delivered the toast.  - Our table was also lacking condiments; ketchup, salsa, and tabasco. After a few attempts get to someone's attention, my GF's mom got up and went into the kitchen and asked for the missing items herself.  - Our waters were filled only once the entire time we ate. I'm not looking for a running river here, but a refresher of the water glasses would be nice.   I really wanted to like this place. It has a great ambiance and decor, but when the food and the customer service are not a in fully symbiotic relationship other things tend to follow suit.   EAT. is NOT A-Ok, but just ok. I believe in second chances so I will be back, but I will be avoiding the Sunday brunch crowd.",

The staff was extremely friendly, and I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere as a change to the glitz / glam of many Vegas restaurants.  The Strawberry Biscuits were so filling. You can order it as an entree or an appetizer to share. I also ordered a side of bacon-- I'm not sure what cut of bacon they order at eat, but it was damn good. The portion size was generous too!   If you're eating with friends and planning to go dutch, bring cash. They do not split checks.",

    "text": "This review is based on my own personal taste. Long story short, I don't think I would come back.   I ordered the free-range chicken sandwich with mozzarella, greens, tomatoes, and pesto. You would think this is kind of a healthier choice right? I took one bite and it tastes like POPCORN! I was weirded out...haha. I kept trying to figure out why it tasted like popcorn and then I realized how much butter they put on the bread. It's like they smothered it with layers of butter while toasting it. All I tasted was butter. So this is definitely not a healthy place. Everything is covered in oil, butter, sauce, etc. You get one pickle spear with the dish and even the pickle was not good. I personally believe they should change the brand they buy (again, this is all based off of personal taste. I'm sure other people love it. Why else would everyone rate it so well). You get one side with the sandwich and I got the tomato soup. Once again, nothing out of this world. Oh and maybe they should use a smaller cup to put it in so that the bowl does not look so empty since it's just a side (presentation is important!).   As far as service...mediocre. The girl was helpful and answered my questions but she doesn't seem happy to be at work. Maybe she was having a bad day. When we finished with our meal, they just dropped off the check without offering us dessert or coffee.   Eat has a very nice chill atmosphere on the inside and it seems like a great place to meet up for brunch/lunch but it's just not really my cup of tea. Sorry.",

    "text": "My favorite ritual before leaving Las Vegas is finding a new breakfast spot. This time around we found \"eat.\" just because it was near our hotel. The place is lively but not too long of a wait even on Sunday. They serve a New American style of food that is delicious and healthier than most places you'll find around here.  With a 15 minute wait for 2 people it wasn't too long of a wait. We came in just before noon and the place was bustling with life. With a hip yet eclectic vibe, the place consisted of Vegas locals and as well as their fair share of visiting food goers.   I ordered the \"Two Eggs Any Style\" with Chicken Sausage instead of bacon and a cup of their hot coffee. The coffee was good but what you'd expect at most breakfast spots. The whole meal was more than enough for any one person but I wish I could've eaten it all. The eggs were great (Over Easy) and the chicken sausage was great too but the star of the meal were definitely the potatoes. The potatoes are cooked with rosemary and onions and has that delicious seared taste that you want in a good set of breakfast potatoes. The best part is that they give you a hefty serving and you'd probably be able to split it if you're thinking of a light start to your Vegas weekend!   The service was fantastic and the one error I had with my meal was quickly resolved without a hitch. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the crowd that comes in ranges from young to old. If you're looking for a solid breakfast to start your day for just a moderate amount. You'll find your money's worth here.",

There was a wait about 20 minutes but we agreed to sit by the bar so it was only like 10 minutes. We actually enjoyed the bar counter because we could see the chefs working their magic in the open kitchen.  I was craving eggs so badly and didn't want to go to Eggslut. I got scrambled eggs and corned beef. Each bite of my scrambled egg felt like dancing on the clouds and tasted soft and fresh! Corned beef was just a little chewy and cooked to perfection.

While one can always grab lunch or breakfast in any of the casinos along Fremont Street, there's nothing hip, upbeat with an amazing menu & great service like EAT of downtown Las Vegas.  After being born and raised in larger metropolitan cities, my favorite dining places are always the ones that are the hole in the wall locations where they are the True gems, best kept secrets and where you normally can only find them via word of mouth.   EAT is one of those places. It's located on a corner building, simple, intimate setting yet with the hip, vibe and groovy culture of downtown.  For breakfast, try the Truffle Egg Sandwich, Mediterranean Egg White Fritatta and I'd say the BEST (made to order) Beignets west of New Orleans' Cafe Du Monde original.  Yummm!!!

    "text": "Eat earned these five stars. A friend and I got here during their brunch service and ordered a wide swath of their menu, and everything was exceptional. EVERYTHING.   The chicken sandwich was delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, the vegetables were fresh, and the bread was light and airy. The potato salad that came with it was also pretty perfect.  The orange juice was clearly freshly squeezed and balanced sweetness with citrus perfectly.  The Applewood smoked bacon was deliciously meaty and fresh from the pan.  The coffee was exactly what breakfast coffee should be; strong and tasty without any annoying acidity, but not with a flavor that overshadows the rest of the meal.  The pancakes were delicious and filling without being too heavy. The sausage on top and dusting of powdered sugar were a nice touch.  Above all of that, the staff were phenomenal. They were friendly, brought the food out quickly, and accommodated us with a smile. EAT was fantastic, and we would definitely go here again.",

    "text": "I was looking for a new restaurant off the strip on my last day in Vegas. It was Sunday noon and was craving for a hearty breakfast..eggs and pancakes to be honest. I know there's plenty to eat at the strip but as I was checking out reviews on Yelp, this place had great reviews and it was located near Freemont area. Parked the car (plenty of street parking), walked in, buzzing place, seated right away, and was hypnotized by the food that was coming out of the kitchen. Communal table, 4 tops that were decently spaced from each other, a terrace seating area...love the gastro pub look. I had to sit by the open kitchen cause I enjoy watching food prep...it reminded me of GiGi's in Miami :) 1st ordered the Golden Brown Pancakes w/ chicken-apple sausage and pure maple syrup. These were probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Thick, fluffy, huge, the sides were little toasted for crunch...YUM!  2nd course, Downtown Benedict - poached eggs, turkey bacon, spinach, tomato & herb hollandaise, whole wheat English muffin...FRESH! (See My Pics) Make sure to check out the \"Specials\" not listed on the menu and the gigantic sandwiches. Wish I had one more day in Vegas so I could try other dishes cause I was drooling on each plate that came out of the kitchen :)",

    "text": "Have you ever had a decent meal...not spectacular, not horrible, but decent....and then when you leave, you think, \"Why did I just spend $30 on that?\"  That's how Eat was for me.  The restaurant itself is concrete floors and walls, so it was very cold in there.  I wore my jacket the entire time.  I ordered a coffee to warm up, but alas it was the bottom of the pump dispenser so it was lukewarm and watery, very weak.  I had to wait until the next pumper came out to warm it up...and the new batch was still pretty weak and watery tasting.  But coffee isn't what sells a place, the food is.  My husband got the shrimp and grits.  It was good, the shrimp tasted very fresh, but at $12 (and 3 shrimp), it was a little steep.  I got the Huevos Motulenos which is eggs, red and green chili, and bananas (weird, I know, but I wanted to try it).  Again, it was good.  Just good.  And when we paid our $30 tab, we both thought it wasn't worth that.  I'd try this place again for lunch and a sandwich, but I'd pass on the brunch again.",

Lisa was taken aback when the waiter said, \"she's not going to do that\" to a light preparation request for her dish.  Our server was earnest but not professional.  Not a complaint or disappointment but I mention it only because it slows down the meal which increases your chances of  standing in line waiting for a table.  So to recap,  if you like your food full flavored search out 'eat' and that would be 4 stars.  If you're a \"gravy on the side with dry toast\" sort of person don't waist* your time and that would be 1 star.  I'm a lard ass and will be back soon.  Mike  *It is a pun.",

He said he could have used more sauce and maybe whip cream it could have been 5 stars. I had the golden pancake and it was so good. Soft and cake like inside and crispy on the outside. I also ordered a side of chicken sausage and coffee. People raved about the coffee it was ok. But as I saw orders being sent out one that stood out I saw pancakes with a deep fried egg on top. So I asked our server about it and she said that was today's special or secret menu. Also listed other items on certain days. Umm Hello I didn't know this you didn't mention this when we sat down. You should have told us about the specials that were not on the menu ugh!!!!!  Well that's why no 5 stars. Other than that will visit again when in town. If you r visiting ask about the specials",

    "text": "After three tries, decided it was time for the review. Overall, very positive experience, I dig the place and wish them well.  Atmosphere: at 7th and Carson, the location may turn some off or make it tough to find, but it's really not too far off the beaten path.  Although you may be pretty close to the other tables, the walls are all window so it gives a more open appearance.  The tables may be close for comfort for some, but I'm fine with it.   BONUS: Sunday brunch had an excellent jazz band.  I suspect it may be a bit loud if right next to them, but from the back it was fine.  Food: This is a modern southern style of food.  I've been for breakfast twice and brunch. I work far away so I can't comment on lunch.  We've had the Beignets: Maybe a bit doughy, but the jams and mascarpone are great.  Their verson of benedict was nice.  My favourite is the oft mentioned Shrimp and Grits.  The shrimp is delicate and mixes surprisigly well with the butter/bacon egg combo.    In an entire bit of constructive criticism, I do hope that the menu changes a little bit for the seasons, ans the somewhat heavier food served here may not be too appetizing in the summer.  I have to mention the pancakes,, not a fan of pancakes, but these were excellent.  Just enough crisp without burn, no doughiness and tasty enough without the syrup.  Service: Everyone s prety positive. You can see there is some occasionall hecticness when the kitchen gets slammed, but doesn't generally show.  One can tell a good camarederie from the staff.  I'm not personally a fan of service by committee so there are occasional miscommunications, but they are very well staffed so generally you are taken care of.  Bravo, definitely a nice treat when I get to stay in and hang around my downtown for breakfast.  Looking forward to lunch sometime.",

We also had the free range chicken and fresh mozzarella sandwich which was very good, it was a little dry so could have used more dressing and the chicken was a little over cooked but it still was great. Last sandwich was the double blt, that was also very good with thick bacon and avocado slices but the bread (all though nicely toasted and crunchy) was a little too thick to get in your mouth and have a good bite. Great wait staff, very friendly and nice. The restaurant was clean and well kept. Would like to go back and try the breakfast next time we are in town.",

We hit the jackpot when we found out that they were serving the delicious sandwich on our visit. It was truly the highlight of our visit, which 3 out of 4 of us ordered. Simply delicious and a perfect match of ingredients. We also ordered beignets with strawberries to dine on before our breakfast arrived, and they were scrumptious.   There is a bit of a hipster vibe to the place, but non-hipsters shouldn't feel like they'll be snubbed on their visit.

Mine actually itches. eat was such a pleasant respite from the strip mall hell that is most of that town, and it really brings it with the food and the atmosphere.  --Great music playing that's not too loud.  --Fantastic food with something for everyone (and generous portion sizes like the rest of this town).  --We had the truffled egg sandwich minus bacon (hey people, if one doesn't get bacon can you PLEASE add something else or take off some money?!), the arugula/asparagus salad, and a side of cheesy grits. Everything was delicious, and the home fries that come with the egg sandwich are actually REAL home fries, as in, crisped and tossed with onion. We saw a number of delicious-looking menu items gets sent out from our counter/kitchen-view seats. The housemade veggie burger looked particularly amazing too.  --Also, coffee!! The first/only decent coffee I had on the whole trip, and you can get Sugar in the Raw.  --Leftovers NOT packed in styrofoam!! Hallelujah! While the rest of Las Vegas attempts to kill the environment and the humans in it at every turn, here at eat you can get leftovers packed in paper!  We had counter seats with a view (and ear) to the kitchen. We figured out why there are so many complaints about service. It is slow and inconsistent, and frequently there were up to 8 meals ready to go out to tables, but servers weren't taking them as fast as the kitchen was working. Also, for some reason, instead of table numbers or seat numbers, one person would say \"This is for the heavyset gentleman in the hat over there\" rather than \"This is table 11.\" Very odd.   Our service was fine, and we weren't in a hurry but I hope if any owner/manager reads this you'll take the service complaints to heart. They seem valid. Also, vegetarians really hate having to ask for a left-off ingredient like bacon, prosciutto, sausage (things with an upcharge) but not getting offered something for a sub or $1 off.  If I ever have to return to the saddest place in the world I will eat here at least once.",

The location might come off a tad bit gritty compared to the glitzy strip. But the food was a good mid-range brunch price ($8-$14). And the service was warm, expedient, and attentive! I had a flight to catch and they got me in and out in 35 minutes--which I have to say is quite commendable being they were probably 75% full on a Thursday morning.   I ordered the corned beef hash which was quite delicious and a offered a big portion. Side note: as far as hashes go, I've been mostly neutral on hash dishes in general but I did enjoy the hearty meal and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection, rightly runny as a good poached egg should be. And I ordered one golden brown pancake and I have to say...that was one of the best unadulterated, simple, just-how-your-G Ma-made-it-but-better pancakes that I've had in a long while. Definitely recommend a stopover--if not for the pancakes alone.",

We had to wait again (15+ min) to get seated inside.  After our meal, it took our waitress sooooo long to get our checks and to get us out.  I ordered pancakes, and sure there's not much to it but they were on the dry side. I had to drown them in syrup.   This place wasn't bad but definitely hyped up. I'll try it again and order something different and hopefully the service gets better.",

The hostess was rude and not accommodating. You have the feeling that you are being rushed. Our server rolled her eyes when she tried to take my husbands plate and he told her he was not finished yet. We were a group of eight but when we asked if we could be seated together the hostess said no even though there was clearly Seating available. So the food is great but the overall service was very poor and that matters to me.",

Restaurant was decorated very well - industrial chic with fresh vibrant colors.  Location was in a good spot in the heart of Fremont East \"downtown.\"  The food I'd give it just an OK rating.  Had pancakes, which you cant really screw those up.  They were good.  The chicken or turkey sausage on top was a bit odd tasting.  I covered in ketchup to be able to eat.  We also ordered the Grilled Cheese with tomato soup - that was the surprising dish.  I expected so much more.  The cheese was dry and hard.  The amount of bread was overwhelming - way too much.  The soup was no better than what would come from a can.  Almost flavorless.  I can make better grilled cheese at home and Bar + Bistro has to die for tomato soup.    I think overall, the food had an off day.  I'd go back and try some other things just because of ambiance and location and I like to give em' a 2nd try.",

On Saturday they serve brunch all day. The brunch menu is different from the breakfast menu, but isn't listed online. It gets really loud in there because of the echo. The coffee is great unlike many other breakfast places. I ordered the benedict and the eggs were perfect. The turkey bacon is flavorful and ample. The hollandaise is just right, hint of citrus. It's also loaded with cooked spinach, yessss. When I first saw my plate I was worried that it may not be enough food, but I walked out completely full. My husband thought the same thing when he saw his plate of pancakes, but he too was full. The pancakes are thin and are legitly homemade. They pile them high serving it with a tiny jar of syrup. Very good, but doesn't beat Dupar's. Our food companion ordered huevos motulenos with an extra side of green chilies. It was an insane amount of food and he sweat through his shirt. I also wanted to say how nice the bathroom is. Clean, private and well stocked.  I want to come here every weekend.

    "text": "After knowing the Chef's previous creations at PJ Clarke's I was looking forward to a restaurant where she could do everything her own way. I am glad to say her way is the right way. I love everything about Eat. from the restaurants decor and location. Both suggest an approachability and made me feel that this was somewhere where I can be myself.  The menu, as many have stated before, is not that big but I'd rather have a small menu of amazing choices than a huge encyclopedia of a menu with minimal choices. The menu were pages attached to a clipboard, another show on how unpretentious but subtly creative this restaurant is, and cater majority to Brunch items. All menu items, I was happy to read on the bottom of the menu, are bought locally and I could tell by how fresh everything was.  I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich which was suggested on Eater Vegas and the portion was bigger than I expected. It's eggs, bacon, mushrooms and feta cheese on ciabatta bread and it had a side of chive potatoes and a strawberry.  Everything was cooked to perfection!  Overall, food was phenomenal and staff was friendly and efficient. The decor was nature meets industrial meets modern. There's a food counter available if you're alone and prefer to eat quickly while on a lunch break. Check out the art at the entrance of the restaurant which feature aspiring young artists which I thought was a great move on Chef Natalie Youngs part because she knows personally how great a helping hand is so that you can fully realize your dream and with this restaurant I can say without a doubt her dream has came into fruition. I'll be back again.",

    "text": "Eat you might, good eats you might not. I am sad that my experience at this place was not one that would leave an ever lasting desire to go there again. The servers didn't listen well and the food was bland. As a side note I believe that a restaurant that is only open for brunch time should probably serve the whole menu.   I live in the downtown area and was thrilled when I heard this Eat was opening.  I had been thinking about going for weeks... finally I made my way down to eat.    When we arrived it was about 1pm... they close at 2 now, but by the way everyone was paced it seemed as if they were already trying to close.  There were about 10 people in the place.  It is clean and nicely decorated. There were two hipster girls that were running food and drinks back and forth.  Girl 1 gave us our seat and menu.  Girl 2 brought us water. Girl one came to take our drink order... Coke, coffee... Girl 2 brought them out, and said the creamer was coming. Girl 1 came by to take order... I tried to order pancakes because I saw them on the sides menu, but they stop with breakfast at 11 so I  ordered the veggie chili, and my bf ordered the free range chicken sandwich. I asked for honey as girl one was walking away but said sure... she came back with creamer. I asked again.  I received a big bowl with a corn tortilla, it had flavor of spice and chicken... I didn't think this is was I ordered... my bf was not very pleased with his sandwich.  It was bland and was dripping water with every bite. The chips were greasy and soggy... Girl 2 came by and dropped off the check by conveniently placing it on the table so that my bf had to move his arm to make way for the bill.  LOL.  He moved it to the center of the table and I picked it up and said, \"no, no, it belongs under your elbow, put it back.\"  Geez... thinking that I has not received what I ordered because I noticed there was chicken in it, I checked the bill.  It said Pasole.  Good thing I am not a vegetarian anymore... I would have been furious.  I notified Girl 2.  She apologized and said I wouldn't have to pay for the pasole... and would get me some chili. How very kind.  Girl 1 came back inquiring.  I told her I thought I ordered chili. \"Oh you wanted the BLACK BEAN chili.\"  She left.  Girl 2 came back and said, \"sorry the pasole is green chili pasole and so they are often confused.\"  I asked her to take this plate away.   Note to yelp: If you are vegetarian, and want to order the veggie chile make sure you say black bean very clearly this way you don't accidentally take a bite of their chicken pasole.    My chili came out... it was cold. There was no slice of corn bread or crackers.  Just plain chili, by then my bf was done eating and I wasn't hungry anymore... I got it to go.  They brought me a to coffee cup... I threw my chili in there... we paid for it and went on about our day.  PS.  I know I am a bit of a foodie and have given a few other restaurants downtown low reviews.  My hope is that they will improve and meet a higher standard making the downtown community a great place to live, work and eat.",

    "text": "Not affiliated with the EAT in Los Angeles, this place was still very good.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was seasoned good and was presented good with scratch gravy on top with steaming hot potatoes.  The beef is chuck very well tenderized and it's a thick steak.  Tenderizing a thick steak does require a lot of pounding and I felt that the fat was pounded out of this steak, so it ended up being a bit lean and dry.  More gravy would have fixed this issue.  Sister had the truffled egg croissant.  I tried some of it and didn't get much of the truffle oil.  Bacon was crispy good and the croissant had a good flaky texture. Good service too.",

I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the chicken fried steak. They were both amazing but the shrimp and grits took the cake! The shrimp were huge and meaty and the sauce with the over easy eggs were to die for. The chicken fried steak had an awesome spice to the breading and was cooked perfectly! The only downfall to this place was no alcohol. Probably didn't need it on New Year's Day! The coffee was outstanding and the passion fruit ice tea was great! It was not sweet but really good. Would come back and try the truffle egg sandwich next time!",

We were just passing through on a road trip and needed a place with a patio that was pet friendly as we had our little mini pig in tow. We were met by a wonderful staff all around. They were not only very sweet to our little pig, but just friendly people all around and really provided great service. Even met the owner and she was quite a wonderful lady and you can tell she has put a lot of love into this place. The menu is very accommodating to all types of eaters from vegan to meat eaters and they are very easy going when it comes to substitutions if you want a dish to suit your specific needs. They serve hearty portions with thick delicious bread on the sandwiches. Again... we got the pancakes for the table to share as just an afterthought and were shocked at how perfect they were. This place is a must try if you are in Vegas!",

After a short jaunt down Carson street, we turned a corner and I felt like I was back in downtown Sacramento. The restaurant is corky and trendy, and has a really fun feel. I ordered the arugula salad and my friend had the egg Benedict with turkey bacon. So good! And the service was obscenely fast! It's like they already knew what we wanted before we even walked in. Planned on visiting this restaurant again the next day but they close at 2:00 on Sundays... boo. This place in Vegas, isn't that when people just wake up?",

As soon as we walked in, we all thought wow this reminds us of a lot of places in Seattle.  The restaurant has a lot of character unlike a lot of the drab boring restaurants off-strip in Vegas.  We went on a Wednesday morning and the place was packed with people.  Service was quick and friendly.  Within the group, we ordered the truffled egg sandwich, two eggs/bacon/chive potatoes, and arugula salad.  The truffled egg sandwich came on a ciabatta bun with mushrooms, eggs, and bacon.  The chive potatoes were delicious and seemed to be sprinkled with some sort of magical sour cream and chives powder.   The bacon was cooked well but didn't leave us wowed.  On the menu, they also have beignets all day and also a breakfast menu until 11am.  The prices were about $10 each, which was extremely reasonable given the amount of food.  The location was just outside of Fremont, perhaps in a slightly sketchy area.  They also have a different menu on weekends, so I'm looking forward to paying them another visit in the future.",

I ended up getting the truffled egg sandwich, my friend got the eggs benedict special they had going on, & we shared a short stack pancake. The truffled egg sandwich looked like it'd be a bit heavy, but the eggs were fluffy, bacon crispy, feta creamy w/ hints of truffle oil, & the skin of chive potatoes had a bit of a crunch that gave a good textural difference and made it a really good side. The pancakes we got were a pretty decent size with some powdered sugar on it. Surprisingly the pancakes had a bit of a crisp on the top layer and were almost cloud like w/o that heavy butter taste. If you're staying Downtown or just want a change in location for brunch I'd definitely recommend this place.",

If you are in the area, don't forget to check this place out.",

Also, we were upcharged for everything without letting us know ($3 to sub side salad instead of potatoes and $5 for three medium pieces of shrimp).  We did complain - no response, no customer service. Additionally this is 2013, how do they not carry gluten free sandwich options?  Place has great potential. Would really love to see them become more customer service oriented. This seems to be a problem throughout Vegas and what keeps us from being a world class city. Backwards mentality. Short term profit instead of customer loyalty. Good luck with that!",

It definitely gets super busy, especially if you're trying to hit up a Sunday brunch but the line usually moves pretty quickly and there's a lot to keep you preoccupied while waiting so I usually don't mind.  As for the food now the menu changes every so often, which isn't a bad thing. I used to get the Downtown Benny, which was basically and eggs benedict, eat. style, but I believe that is off the menu now. The beignets were very tasty while they were offering them, but those were replaced with cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote which are ever better. The Huevos Montellenos are really good as well, there's a surprisingly nice mixture of favors that compliment each well, so I would recommend that. Shrimp and grits are probably the best I've ever had, although I do not eat shrimp and grits often but it was de-lish here. Lastly, the Chicken Fried Steak, holy cow! Amazing. I would have never know how good a Chicken Fried Steak could be had not my boyfriend ordered. That's not really an item on the menu that calls out to me, but eat's was epic. A little heat to it, but I think that's what made it. Oh yeah, the portion for that is pretty big too.",

I had a chicken sandwich with free range chicken and you could taste the difference.  Plus, they make their own potato chips which were delightful.  But, my wife was looking for plain breakfast food, and eat. doesn't have your typical breakfast fare.  So, she was not happy with the experience.  When you combine my high rating with her low rating, eat. gets a solid 3 (really more for those looking for a unique experience).  So, this is not a comfort food spot.  It is instead a food experience (whether this will be one time or a frequent spot).",

Everyone was happy with their food (including me), but I did find my entire Tofu Scramble dish unnecessarily covered in oil; But I tried hard to look past that since there was such a good dish underneath. As if it didn't already sound good enough, it tasted even better! I loved the mushrooms & sprouts, & even thought the thick-cut wheat toast was noteworthy - Everything just really worked! The recipe itself is a great one & I would order this over & over again While the service started off good, with the workers carrying drinks & explaining the specials right away, it unfortunately depleted throughout our meal & I wasn't much of a fan by the time we left Some workers were okay but our actual waitress neglected us the entire time we were there, failed to check on us even once, & completely ignored a question/ concern we had about the food & did nothing to help us fix the problem we addressed. Even though it wasn't a big deal, I feel she could have done a much better job esp. after seeing someone else quickly resolve our issue for us, when they weren't even the one that was supposed to be waiting on our table. I also have to say that I hate when people put the bill down on the table MINUTES after we've just received food, but I suppose this was her way of saying that she was done with our table & no longer planned to do much else for us... As this was clearly indicative of her service thereafter. She hardly even deserved a tip since she did next to nothing, but we tried to be nice Anyway, I am only giving this place 5 stars for the food & environment, not the service  Also, you must pay & park in the street. They do not have any designated parking, so it will cost you a couple bucks while you eat here :p Thus turning a 15-20$ meal into something over 20 bucks... May be worth it though!",

For lunch I had the truffled egg sandwich. The bread is so good and fresh. I also tried my friend's roast beef sandwich. It was also excellent. The beignets are good, but not the texture I'm accustomed to having when I visit New Orleans and Savannah. These are denser but still tasty. The staff is always nice and wait time is never more than 15 mins for party of 2.",

    "text": "The wait staff was very friendly, and we arrived around 11:30--just before the lunch rush.  The food was OK, but not really worth the drive and parking to downtown. And I LOVE a good breakfast place.   My friend had the egg truffle sandwich, which she said was pretty good, and I had bacon and eggs, which were decent (but insanely greasy).  The beignets that arrived before the meal were also good--but also incredibly greasy.  At around noon, the crowd picked up and it was very busy.    The kicker for Eat, and the reason I won't be returning, is that upon receiving our credit cards back from the bill, we noticed a photocopied note that had been highlighted, which (very condescendingly) stated that split checks during \"slammed\" times was not appreciated.  Now, had we been TOLD that by the waitress prior to running our check, we would not have split it (down the middle, not by item, mind you).  After an inordinate amount of time between the end of our meal, the dropping of the check, and the waiting for our credit cards back, we were informed by one of the wait staff that Eat only has one credit card machine.  Seriously?  With all the free card runners (Square, etc...) out there, an establishment is going to blame the customer for the slow down of running two cards? And again, it was not busy when we entered, and had the bill been dropped in a timely manner, we could have been on our way, leaving behind us a free table for the crowd.  So there you have it.  Decent, greasy, initial service was friendly, incredibly rude and condescending upon receiving the bill.",

We should have got breakfast at the D or in one of the casinos. One of us got a dish they called Chilaquiles. Basically it was corn chips with a small amount of melted cheese, scrambled egg and a split sausage link of some kind. Ok but not really good by any means. I had the Huevos Motulenos. It is basically a tortilla with black beans, feta (which you cannot taste as it is overpowered by everything else), banana,two eggs and salsa. It was good, not great. I had water, friend had a cup of coffee. It was $29 and change BEFORE the tip. Just too much, folks. Wasn't worth the cost.",

The food was good really good. Tasted fresh.My only issue was for 2 breakfasts 2 coffees and 2 ojs it was like $67.

    "text": "We were excited to try this new downtown breakfast and lunch joint. Actually we came by last Sunday morning only to find out that they were closed because they had run out of food on the day before (opening day). After doing our due diligence, we had already decided we would try again this Saturday morning and order their beignets, truffled egg sandwich, and pancakes. We were a bit disappointed when the server told us that they only served a \"special\" (more like limited) brunch menu on weekends and the truffled egg sandwich was only available M-F. Really? That's such an arbitrary limitation, but we got over it. I decided to go with the free range chicken sandwich instead.  The beignets ($8) came out first and looked great. There were 5 pieces, and they were served with a tasty homemade strawberry jam and an overly thick vanilla mascarpone. Unfortunately, these beignets are not light, flaky, and fluffy but rather dense and doughy. They are essentially little doughboys or deep fried balls of dough. Calling them \"beignets\" is a stretch.  We enjoyed the pancakes ($9) which came in a stack of 4. They had a great crispy texture along the edges and were served with a single small but tasty chicken-apple sausage. However, we did note with dismay that both the pancakes and sausage had sections that were charred completely black. I don't know about you, but I like to keep my carcinogen consumption down to a minimum.  The chicken sandwich ($12) came with a choice of homemade potato chips or potato salad. I went with the latter. For the price, we felt the portion sizes were off. The chicken sandwich was kind of small and should be at least 50% bigger while the potato salad was fairly generous. The chicken was underseasoned and sort of bland, but was ok when combined with a bite of the overly salty potato salad.  The space has a trendy downtown loft vibe. Despite the seemingly large number of servers, service was a bit slow, especially on water refills and collecting the check. We would possibly return for the pancakes and perhaps to try the seemingly elusive truffled egg sandwich. However, from a taste and value standpoint, we would pass on the beignets and chicken sandwich.",

So when we were looking for a decent breakfast option before leaving Vegas to head home, we thought we would give it a try.  It is in a small, nondescript location a bit off the strip. Parking can clearly be a challenge but it is available especially if you don't mind walking for a bit. There are a few metered spots right in front. Around the corner, you can park on the street for free. And there is a parking garage a block or two to the west, right on the strip. I do not know whether there was a fee for the garage.  The restaurant is small and will get busy early. Most of the tables are intended for parties of 2-4. Plan to wait a while for a table especially if you have a large group. But it is well worth your time.  We decided to keep it simple for the first time around. Both my wife and I had the pancakes with chicken apple sausage. As I said before, these were awesome! The pancakes are huge. You may want to check them out before ordering, just to see if you need to split or try a short stack. We had heard a lot about the beignets and were looking forward to trying them. Unfortunately, the restaurant was out of them. I do not know if this is a common occurrence, but it is worth noting if you have your heart set on these. For us, we just have another reason to visit.  I highly recommend eat. I do not think you will be disappointed.",

My heart was crushed to learn they didn't have any :( Alas, I opted for a chicken sandwich and it was good; nothing too special. The service was okay and given how small the menu is, I expect the staff to know the ingredients of the menu items which wasn't the case.  Would I return? Only If I happened to be in the area but wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "Eat. is as straight-to-the-point as its name implies, and there's nothing wrong with that.  To start, parking is a little limited since it's on the corner of Carson and 7th. This isn't a complaint (not the restaurant's fault) so much as it is a warning; be sure to bring change for a meter.  The restaurant has a nice, friendly atmosphere, described as \"retro-chic\" in an article I read about it when it first opened up.That's a pretty good description. I'm not any kind of interior design expert (which is why I stole the term from some local magazine article), so I'll just leave the decor at that. I should probably add that \"retro-chic\" apparently doesn't reach for any overt style associated with a specific decade. In other words, this place isn't art-deco or mod or anything like that; it's as comfortable and down-home as it should be, which is good! It's a small joint but it wasn't totally packed when we came in.  I think we just missed the breakfast crowd though, it began filling up again while we ate.  With that out of the way: the coffee, to paraphrase Dale Cooper, is damn good. It is good enough to drink as black as midnight on a moonless night. We all (unless you're one of those weirdos that don't like coffee) know that this is important for any breakfast/lunch spot. The food itself is also delicious.  On my first visit: we started with beignets to share for the group. They come with a delicious vanilla mascarpone and equally delicious jam.  I'd recommend spreading both on your beignet, it's like your mouth dies and goes to heaven! The beignets are fluffy, light pastries, and, just as they should be, made to order. You won't regret getting them.  I had their benedict on my first visit, since we were there in time for breakfast. In short, it was freaking awesome; so good, in fact, that I couldn't stop myself from using hyperbole in my description of it. The hollandaise sauce had just the right amount of tang; the spinach and tomato tasted fresh; the eggs were perfect; and the turkey bacon had just the right amount of crispness. I also had their pancakes which are light and fluffy, just as a pancake should be. I don't eat pancakes very often so I'm probably not a good judge, but these were very satisfying. If I was feeling more adventurous that day, I would have gotten the huevos motulenos, but that's why I plan on coming for breakfast again  On my second visit, I had their free-range chicken sandwich since it was lunch time.  It comes on ciabatta bread served with greens, mozzarella and pesto spread. Again, the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful, but the pesto really made the sandwich. It's a good light meal, and the home made potato chips that came with it are something special. I'd recommend coming to lunch early if you're interested in the pot pie - my friend was going to get it but we were told they only make a limited amount per day so she had to order something else.   My main complaint is that the service I've received on both visits was \"okay\" at best, but not at all anything to write home about.",

I ordered the country fried steak and it was one of the best I've had. The meat was soo tender and not tough like most breakfast places. It was battered light and fluffy and the homemade gravy was delish topping off the country fried steak perfectly. The potatoes served with it was also cooked to perfection and not too mushy or undercooked. My over medium eggs were cooked just how I like and you could also tell that they were really good organic eggs by the nice yellow color of it - huge plus in my book. The toast were huge thick cuts served nice and warm and fluffy as well. Some might think this place is a little pricey but for the quality and portions of food it is so worth it! I wish I got to try the pancakes but I saw someone with it and they looked soo good I will def be back to try them!",

The outer bite and inner fluffiness was just right, but the flavor a little off. The eggs were cooked really nice and creamy, the potatoes nicely caramelized and the bacon crispy. She liked a lot. But thought it was weird that everything had the same seasoning.  We sat. At the bar so we could get a seat without wait and see them cook. I don't eat meat, so this is always fun to see how vegetarian-friendly a place is. Eat does not claim to be and they are not. The beignets were cooked with the chicken-fried chicken. That's where the off-flavor came from. Who cooks sweet and savory together? We watched as potatoes and pancakes were cooked in the bacon grease, making those not vegetarian options. It was also weird that the chicken-fried chicken was pre-cooked. They pull a Saran wrapped cooked cutlet from the fridge and drop in in the oil to twice-cook it. Maybe that's their thing, but people loved it. We also watched as almost everything sent out got a got couple shakes of some salt seasoning. I tried a taste of the eggs and the seasoning was good, just my gf didn't think it needed to be on everything.  Overall, good for meat-eaters, bad for veg. Even if it looks veg on the menu.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I've been to Eat many times.   The last 3 times I've been I've had an unfortunate experience.  The first two involved the seating.  When you have open tables and you have no persons waiting, instead of cramming us in the corner, give us an open table (4 of them).  The excuse I got was that they were reserved for 'larger' parties...more than the two in my party.   The second time was almost the same exact experience.  Today, it wasn't about the searing, it was about the food.   I ordered the two eggs breakfast and my girl ordered the pancakes.  The pancakes are delicious.  Today, they weren't as crisp, but still good.  My breakfast was not up to standard.  I ordered my eggs over-easy.  They came runny and the toast was cold. I table next to us also had a problem with the eggs.  That gentleman ordered the corn beef hash.  He waited for his eggs as long as I did (9 minutes).  As I waited, I nibbled on the pancakes.  I also ordered an extra egg with breakfast.   So, when the check came, my meal was full price.  I was also charged for the extra egg ($2).  I never complain about the cost of food, but when the order is messed up, it should be corrected on the bill.  It never was.  Maybe cover the cost of the drinks ($3 each) or the extra egg.  Even a discount (maybe 50%) off MY meal.  I'm not looking for free. With so many options living downtown, why would I go back to a spot where they don't take care of the customer?   I give the waitress props (Christina) because she was obviously perturbed over the problems.  Gary (I think it's his name), that consistently made sure the coffee and water were filled, deserves props too.   I'm hopeful they read the reviews and respond to my concern.",

The owner takes pride in all aspects of the establishment and is very diligent about walking about and standing over operations (sometimes reminding staff about what they should be doing).     The service was pretty good...we were well tended to and never really needed anything.  From what I gathered it seems like they are still working out an effective plan for better logistical coordination of guests when it gets crowded; but that did not affect us as we arrived right before the lunch crowd.  The food was delicious - it is not your typical breakfast and lunch fare - this place offers you up gourmet offerings in unique and creative ways which will have you wishing you were more hungry; so you could try out more than just one entree.  Believe me; you need to be famished when you go because you will not want to stop eating.  Hence the title - eat.  I really enjoyed it and when back in Vegas; will most definitely try to get back over to this part of town for such great food.",

    "text": "Ok for us... service was decent, but for some reason wasn't wow'ed by the food.  Came here based on Yelp reviews for brunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday late morning; we were purposefully looking for spots that were NOT on the Strip so we chose this non touristy place in the downtown area.  Venue / Service: slightly on the dark side when we came in, with grey wood and wrought iron decor.  Luckily we had a bit of sunlight by sitting near the window.  Vibe of a down to earth, homey brunch spot and thank goodness it was a much quieter affair than you would find on the Las Vegas Strip.  Servers were in general very friendly, always checking on the waters and trying to reassure us that our food was coming out.    Food: I prefer lighter affairs so perhaps I'm biased against most brunch spots.  Even so, I felt like everything here tended to be a bit on the heavier side, but perhaps we ordered the wrong items.  -- Eggs benedict (spinach, tomato, bacon, chive potatoes)($13) - well balanced dish; this was the favorite between the two dishes.  Eggs were perfectly cooked and yolky.  What saved this dish was 1) the acidity from the grilled tomatoes and 2) the kick you got from the hollandaise sauce.  I usually hate things that have heat to it, but you needed the spiciness a bit to lighten up the dish (especially since there was a huge dollop of the sauce over the eggs; would have preferred less of that).  Potatoes were... potatoes... I didn't need them.    -- Truffled egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon on ciabatta with chive potatoes)($12) - recommended by the waiter but unfortunately we were disappointed.  Mushrooms and chives were great in terms of adding earthy flavors, but the eggs were slightly overcooked and overall, the dish felt really heavy.  There was too little feta to help with that and also a lot of bread.  We both kept wishing it had some sort of acidity / more herbs in it to brighten up the dish; my date struggled to finish it without feeling heavy in the stomach.  Overall, probably not the best brunch we had.  However, if you are looking for a nice, quieter spot in DT Las Vegas, this can be a spot to consider (just perhaps don't go for that sandwich).",

My friend suggested they put top tables together for our party of 4 adults and 1 child. They said they couldn't do that so our party sat at two tables next to one another.  When we placed our orders, the waitress said the kitchen was backed up. We watched dishes of food piling up because the servers weren't getting to them fast enough. I'd give 3 stars for the experience, 4 for the food.  I had the corned beef and hash. It was delicious. Rarely do you find corned beef with big chunks of corned beef. I was told that the restaurant is not usually like this service wise. I'd definitely go again and hope it isn't as busy.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for years even though the service is the absolute worst.  The FOOD is all that saves this place.  Had a terrible experience this morning and sent the following email to the management.  Who knows if they will respond.    My email:   Hello.  This morning my husband and I ate at your place, which we have done many of the years of living here, and had some of the worst service we have experienced from you all.  The truth is, we KNEW coming in we were going to get bad service because over the years it has seemed that the more popular EAT gets, the less you guys care about showing a little hospitality towards people who come in.  I always recommend EAT to people (I work on the Strip), but I always warn them about what a crap shoot it is going to be service wise.  Today was the bottom.... :(      We got to your place around 10:24am, and you had your typical brunch crowd, busy but not balls to the wall in the weeds.  We were quoted 20 mins, no biggie, and after about 8 minutes I realized there was a counter near the kitchen that seemed to be first come, first served.  So I ask the hostess if we can sit there if it is first come, first served and she was super reluctant saying, \"Yeah, I don't know.  I'm gonna have to ask.  There are people in front of you.\"  Really.  No kidding?? I couldn't have fathomed that the other people waiting were NOT before me.  An 89 person place isn't big, so I watched her NOT EVEN MAKE AN EFFORT to find out the information (which she already knew), and to the minute that I type this, she STILL hasn't let us know, \"Sure.  You can sit there,\" or \"No.  You can't sit there,\" or even \"F you, we decide who sits there.\"  NADA      We continue to wait, get seated after our quote time by ten minutes (which happens), and then a first server comes to take a drink order, but doesn't say anything welcoming.  No \"Hi.  How are you?  Can I get you started with something to drink?\"  Instead it was:  walk up, \"What do you want to drink.\"  Very off putting.  Then she brings the drinks back and informs us she isn't our server (which working in a restaurant, I know when people are helping each other out).  Then Jessica, our server walks up and says, \"Looks like you've decided, what are you having?\"  No, \"Hi! Thanks for waiting,\"  or \"Hi!  I'm Jessica.  Did you have any questions I could answer about the menu?\"        These people are straight up order takers.  Why do you need them?? Why not do what MTO in Summerlin did and just install an order counter and let people skip the awkwardness of having to be polite and tip your completely oblivious staff???       The food came out fast enough and was as amazing as it always is (which is the ONLY reason we keep coming back), but we didn't see Jessica until she presented the check, and had to ask another server to refill our coffee.  I saw the kind of service she was giving... silent service.... but again, we were ignored.       The check came as we were only halfway through eating (we've been at your place at this point, seated, for about 30 minutes, and that includes menu looking, ordering and waiting for the food).  I felt like I was at Cracker Barrel, except that Cracker Barrel at LEAST does a two minute or two bite check back to make sure all is ok.  That non-hourly counter top idea is looking pretty good now, isn't it?       I get it.  Bourdain has been to your joint.  You've got a super talented chef who makes kick ass food, and over the years this community has really taken notice.  I know.  I am involved in this community.  But the only two things saving you at 7th and Carson is that the food is amazing and you get a lot of tourists.  Let's be honest, the level of service in a lot of Vegas is shit because we always have volume (which you make clear in that note at the host stand asking for patience while you are slammed, but said in a way that is fake and uppity).  If your quaint 89 person gig was in a regular town where people really cared to spread the word, you might but your people through better hospitality training.  Breakfast/Brunch is a hard gig.  I've done it.  But you can still be as hospitable slinging $5 eggs as you can an $800 Robuchon.        I left the server a note (which I have a pic of if you want it) where I expressed these concerns, and I unfortunately had to tip 9% (which is an over payment).  Why didn't I get a manager?  Because it wasn't apparent there even was one.  But I'll tell you what the note said:  \"Please make your guests feel like they matter -- that their time and money matter -- because they do.  This is for this STAFF, not just you.  Be a hospitality person... not just an order taker.  +Do not rush people when they are only half way through their meal.  This food deserves more respect than that.\"  I hope someone is listening.",

I asked him how the corned beef hash was, and he replied with \" Umm.. its fresh corned beef..\" and i just looked at him like \"Geez, okay thanks.\" We proceeded to order appetizers; which were an order of deviled eggs, and tomato soup. Then ordered our entrees which were corned beef and hash, and the reuben sandwich.  The Coffee we ordered was horrible, bitter, tasteless, just burnt. We couldn't even finish a cup of coffee and usually, we have 3 or 4 cups each.   20 Minutes later we got our appetizers, AND our entrees at the same time. Not only did we make it clear during the ordering process, we figured the server knew we wanted to start with the STARTERS, and after the starters are finished, typically you get your entrees then. The Tomato soup was so sour, it was inedible. The Corned Beef and Hash, not only did it not look fresh, but was cold. The Reuben sandwich, not only was the ratio of meat to bread ridiculous, but the meat was very dry and flavorless. The potato salad it came with was ice cold, and bland.  The only thing that we actually really enjoyed, were the deviled eggs. They were absolutely delicious!  Right when we were thinking maybe this was just a bad day for the kitchen, we decide to give this place another chance, Until we get our bill; and inside reads a message reading \" We love and welcome your business, but please be courteous to those waiting to sit with us, when we are slammed.\"  So pretty much, eat and get the hell out. like..WHAT?! Seeing as both of us live here and work in this industry. This was the most unprofessional crappy note we've ever seen. We definitely will not be returning. Seeing as there is a ton of other places in Downtown that would appreciate our business instead of being snubbed and told to get out.",

I had the shrimp and grits, that's new territory for me having never had grits before. I have no comparison but it was so tasty. Covered with two over easy eggs and topped with a bruschetta type tomatoes and shrimp. We need to go back before vacation is over.",

Not used to that in Vegas.  OK, now inside, pleasantly greeted, seated promptly, got coffee and water quickly.  Perfect!  I really had no idea what I ordered by its name, but it was pretty good.  It had beans, corn tortillas, red and green sauce, sausage and salsa on it.  To be fair, it was ok, honestly, there was a little too much flavor on the plate, my taste buds were kinds confused.  Presentation and quickness of service was perfect.  Waitress was amazing!  Its almost at 5 stars!  Will definitely be back next time in Vegas!",

We decided to go anyway & saw that it was pretty darn busy. There were at least 10-15 people waiting outside. I almost wanted to turn around and just pick another place. I'm glad I didn't. They said the wait was about 25 minutes when we got there. They took us in within 10 minutes!!!   We ordered the eggs benedict, truffled egg sandwich & the cinnamon biscuits!! They were all super delicious! It literally only took them about 10 minutes (at most) to bring out the food! We were so amazed! We were in and out of there within 35 minutes. Their customer service is great and their food is amazing, what more could you ask for?",

    "text": "Took the City bus (it was $8 for a 24hr bus pass) from the strip, got off at Fremont Street and walked I'm guessing around 10 blocks to Eat.   We were there on a Sunday and they closed at 2pm as it said on Yelp, I called just to make sure and they told me their last seating was at 1:30pm and yes they close at 2.   We walked in around 1:15pm, party of 2 and were seated right away. I looked over to my left to see this girl eating this huge portion of Chicken Fried Streak...it looked really good and I almost ordered it but after reading on Yelp how everyone loved the Shrimp & Girts I decided I would just have to come back for what she had.   My friend ordered the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup, she said it was amazing. I enjoyed my Shrimp & Grits , so good I wanted more. Good size filling portions for sure.  We also shared a order of the Cinnamon Biscuits which I didn't expect them to come out the way they did all covered in the most beautiful strawberry sauce. I thought they were just going to be biscuits with a strawberry/cinnamon jam to spread on to but oh no, it was like eating a dessert and since I don't like to share my dessert I was kind of sad I was sharing this...it was soooooo good. Whenever I come back I will always order the Cinnamon Biscuits to start.   The only 2 things I didn't like about the place (and my reason I didn't give 5 stars) was they don't serve alcohol which I was surprised since it is Vegas, I really wanted to get a Mimosa or some kind of fun brunch drink....we just got off the plane a few hours ago and I was dying for something.  What I did get was the Passion Fruit Ice Tea which I wouldn't order again due to not tasting any of the passion fruit what so ever.   Really I give 4.5 stars I'll be back!",

(I hate when places skimp on the best part.) The truffled egg sandwich was okay for me. I guess I had a different idea of what it would be. It turned out to be more an omelet on baguette.   The service was good even being as busy as they were. Not to sound like a granny who forgot her Metamucil, but the only thing that really bothered me was how loud it was.

Eggs and mushrooms are rich and earthy. Bread is soft, warm, and wonderful. Bacon is crispy and delicious. I was a bit too full for the potatoes though!  Beverage of the passionfruit iced tea.

Ridiculous!",

    "text": "Fresh vibe, fresh people, and fresh ingredients. I came here for the brunch bc who doesn't like breakfast foods mid-day? Or night? The food is sourced from local vendors and is considerably healthy. I went for the truffled scrambled eggs w/wild mushrooms, chives and bacon on ciabatta, and diced potatoes. You get a LOT of food. I ate the sandwich open-face style and tossed a slice of ciabatta off to the side. The eggs were light and fluffy. I could smell the truffle on them. The bacon was crispy the way I like it. Did I forget to mention that there's feta? They hide it in the eggs so you don't see it at first glance. A nice little surprise that's for sure. I def recommend it.   Summary: Quick service. Big smiles. Social atmosphere. Open kitchen. Fun menu. Tasty eats. Great choice.",

Since today was one of those rare days, I stopped in!   Overall, great place! Not sure I'd go out of my way too often to dine here, but I will definitely be back.   I had the breakfast sandwich (oops, I forgot the name, but the menu is simple).  It was a ciabatta bun, egg, applewood bacon, feta, and truffle oil sauteed mushrooms.  Served with a side of fresh cooked potatoes. The flavors were awesome, and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients....and some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever tasted (usually I won't eat them)!  The service was great, and the staff is friendly. Every server said hello to me or checked my drink refills at least once while I ate. Not everyone likes that constant attention while eating, but I loved it. It was my first time there, but I felt like I was a neighborhood regular! WOW! What an impression...kudos to the staff!  Parking in the area is kind of a hassle and you will usually have to pay, but it's not too much of a big deal.  I also might like to see more variety in the menu options, but I'll have to see if the menu changes on my next visit to (eat.).",

    "text": "Brad T. and I were looking for a place to eat around downtown and I checked yelp to see what was nearby and saw \"EAT\" with such high reviews.  Of course, we decided to come eat here!   We went on a Saturday morning and it was quite pack, which was okay since I had time to read yelp reviews while we were waiting. I was getting really excited to try their food here and especially when I read that they had beignets!  ....We got seated and I overheard a waitress saying that they did NOT have beignets due to the fact that the cold weather was not letting the beignets rise properly. ( I was so so disappointed!)  But it was okay, I was still really excited to eat their food!  What we ordered: Country Fried Steak (2.5): Unfortunately, I only took a few bites of this, so I cannot review it the best that I can.  However, the chicken fried steak was incredibly dry and I felt like it needed more flavor in it.  The potatoes were good though.   Shrimp & Grits (3): I, also took only a few bites of this as well because I was also pretty disappointed how it tasted like. Maybe because i didn't like the fact that my bacon was soaked with grits.  But the shrimp tasted delicious and I like how it almost seemed like it was a soup, but it wasn't.  I didn't end up finishing it, Brad T. though finished it for me.  Pancake (5): BEST PANCAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED! I absolutely loved it! I love how the top its crispy golden brown. Once you taken a bite of it, oh man! it its absolutely incredible! I highly recommend anyone to order their pancakes!  Service (2): The service was upsetting to say the least.  I understand that they are busy, but at least just come back to our table at least one time. After our server took our order he never ever came back to check up on us.  For instance, I forgot to ask for maple syrup with my pancakes, so I couldn't eat it until I had to wait for a server to look straight at me so I can wave at them. Overall, the service was just really upsetting.  The only time he came back was to give us our check.   Overall (2):  Even though, I loved their pancakes the rest of my experience there was just disappointing.  However, I would like to come back and give them another chance.",

    "text": "Found eat through Yelp and headed there on a Sunday morning. It's in downtown at the corner of 7th and Carson, right across from the relatively new Container Store Park. There is plenty of 2-hour street parking which is free on Sunday. At 10 am, there were a handful of people waiting, so we put our name down for a 20-minute wait. It took a little longer than that, but the staff was very nice and thanked us profusely for waiting and being patient.   The place has a modern feel to it, you would almost think you were Santa Monica as opposed to being about 10 minutes from the Strip. We were seated at a table for two at the end of the counter high table in the middle. The tables were all far apart enough from each other where you didn't feel overcrowded.   I ordered the eggs benedict and K had the corned beef. I loved mine because the turkey bacon it came with what super extra crispy just the way I like. There was a little too much hollandaise sauce for me but for those who like a lot, then you'll love this! My potatoes were booked perfectly with the right amount of crisp (to me they are the perfectors of a nice crisp!) and the portion was plenty filling for $13. K liked his corned beef but it wasn't the traditional kind you might think of, this one had real pieces of meat. And it came with four pieces of super thick delicious Texas toast.   It was a great breakfast especially if you're planning on hanging around in the downtown area. We went across the street to check out the container park and walk off breakfast.",

    "text": "Of all the new places I tried (9!) during my nearly 3 week jury duty stint, eat is the one that has stayed on my brain the most.  At least once a day since I visited there I've envisioned that wonderful chicken banh mi.   You've already seen my rating so you should know that this is not an unpleasant thought whatsoever.   As a matter of fact I wish I could get some sort of chip implanted in my head that would push out anything negative that entered my mindspace and replace it with the deliciousness that is this sandwich.  This is an idea I'm fairly certain I can convince at least Mark Cuban of on Shark Tank.    When I went to eat. to eat. (ha!), I was not surprised to see it jam packed full of people.  That was one of the more disheartening things about downtown in general: it seems that most of the really good places to eat like eat. require a short wait to be seated or require social interaction to a level I'm generally not comfortable with.  Thankfully I tended to venture out to lunch on my own and its much easier to get a table or seat when you're by yourself than otherwise.  If there was ever a case to be made for not having any friends whatsoever, it's that you can get a chicken banh mi sandwich from eat. approximately 10 minutes faster than if you bring a friend.  I got seated at the bar relatively quickly after I arrived, and after perusing the menu I decided pretty quickly on the chicken banh mi because it sounded good combined with the fact I didn't think it'd offend my lactose intolerant sensibilities.  There's not much more I can add to what's probably already been said about the chicken banh mi, and allow me to steal another members perfect picture of it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FdPrha-ksEnqLVmTFMc5vsQ%2Fl.jpg&s=b7565b197a807084ed04cc1c9e810630690a429f6d44962fdf1720bde4bdd315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>.   The flavors popped, and each and every component of it was welcomed into my mouth.   One thing I'll say is that it's not denoted with two asterisks on the menu which is code for \"spicy\", but the slaw on it did contain jalapenos and I actually found myself drinking quite a bit of their wonderful iced tea to counter this.   I LOVE spicy food and still thought it had quite a kick, so something to consider.    Service was extremely fast and efficient, and my iced tea never came close to being empty.  Price was extremely reasonable for what I considered to be an excellent meal.  Bonus: On my walk from the courthouse to eat. (which turned out longer than I expected), I got to see a screaming match between a pedestrian and a driver which provided me a few minutes of voyeuristic entertainment.  It's the little things in life.",

It's in Downtown where the street has posted \"Neighborhood Watch\", so you know it's not a great place to be at night.  The place is clean, bright and modern looking, located approximately 2 miles from the Strip. The food: 1. Beignets, $8 for a place of 6 rectangles, 2-3 inches.  Very good, like donuts but NOT as good as Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.  Came with jam and a \"to die for\" cinnamon butter. 2. Chicken fried steak, $13.  Hubby says it's definitely homemade because the shape was irregular.  I had a bite, good.  But we both agreed we like the CFS better at the Pork Store Cafe in SF. Came with potato chunks. 3. Shrimp and Grits, $12.  I loved this dish.  Layers on the bottom of my dish was creamy, soft grits, topped with a tortilla, bacon strips and the shrimp sauce with large pieces of shrimp.  It was more than enough for 1 person but I stuffed myself and ate the whole thing so as not to waste any.  Milk, $2 and OJ $4.  The chef was working in the back kitchen with 2 other cooks.  This is my bookmark place for local breakfast.  Serving staff were so friendly and were a good tag team, helping each other out, even better than some of the restaurants in the hotels on the Strip.",

However, the prices are a bit high. But then again, it's the only place around where the food is made from scratch. Their homemade potato chips and potato salad are insanely good. I don't normally go for mayo on anything, but it's absolute perfection. Their posole is amazing (love that it's clear broth and not red), Reuben sandwich is amazing, breakfast foods are perfection and those potatoes. This is definitely a comfort food place to go, if you want to take a nap afterwards. No joke!!  It's unbelievable. Pricey, but worth it. I guess. If you don't have the money, you should probably stick with Taco Bell and don't complain about how much it costs. The owner(s) probably want to buy a bigger house, put their kids through college and they have something really amazing here, so why the heck not!!  The prices haven't hindered the majority of clients from going here. So be mindful of what you order. Also know, if you're on a budget, I believe they have an ala cart menu and you can purchase 2 to 3 things and keep it under $10.  Enjoy!!",

WELL today I was SO upset that I vowed to write a review because any place who treats their guests this lousy is not getting my business.   My bf and I came in around 10:30 am.. the hostess informed us that the wait was about 20 min. COOL. then she said oh wait, are you two OK with the bar top? That is open now.. we said sure. She said ok, Ill get it cleaned and you can go over. We misunderstood and walked over to the bar top only to be confronted by the server who basically asked who sent us, and we were escorted back to the hostess where this waitress whispered to the hostess in front of us. SORRY didn't know it was that BIG of a deal. Then we waited an additional 30 minutes while we literally watched the waitress and hostess clean off all the tables... SO the restaurant was practically clear and clean and un-seated while we and MANY others waited in the waiting room. It was just ridiculous. Why would you wait to seat people who have been waiting, and clean the whole place up. Mind you the bar top had already been cleared and was clean and we were still waiting waiting waiting. WE LEFT and I cannot tell you how upset I am still. Drove over 25 min to get there for that RUDE and horrible customer service. Hope they clear that strategy up asap.",

The name is interesting by itself, but the interior of the place is nicely intriguing as well. eat. is a small, clean restaurant with a 'young' vibe. I was seated quickly and ordered a pretty standard meal- scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. Although it is a simple order, eat. managed to impress. The eggs were very smooth, the bacon nice and crispy, and the toast was perfect- it had a very 'homemade' flavor. In addition to the great breakfast, our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  A unique, simple, and tasty place to eat.",

When I put our name on the list, the hostess said \"I'm going to need you to finish that ice tea before you get seated\" there is no way I could finish it that fast. I found this completely ludicrous. I only drink a certain kind of tea that most restaurants don't serve. If they don't have it, I always order water, so it's not like they were missing out on a huge beverage sale by letting me bring my tea in. I completely understand if I came in with an alcoholic drink but that wasn't the case. I was so annoyed by this that we decided to leave and went to another nearby restaurant instead, one that could've cared less about my tea. So they lost out on much more money by us leaving than they would've by just allowing me to have my tea. I go out to eat several times a week. I have never, ever been told I cannot bring my tea in. Very disappointed",

    "text": "We found this place completely by accident. I had Yelped another restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas but when parking proved to be a bigger pain in the ass than it was worth, we just drove in the opposite direction. THEN we stumbled upon this gem. I was pleasantly surprised that as \"hip\" and \"cool\" as the setting and staff were that they were super friendly. I had my grandparents with me and truth be told, they hated the setting and felt a bit out of place but when the food came, their tune changed. I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and Tomato soup. Lovely flavor, would have preferred if it was actually hot though. I understand that restaurants get busy, but really? It's soup. Luckily, it was super tasty so I didn't stay annoyed for too long. But again, the staff was super friendly and were very speedy with recovery when part of my order managed to get lost. All around, the meal my family and I had here was pretty damn good. We all took turns trying each other's food. The chicken pozole was tasty, the corned beef with poached eggs was insane, the menus were short and to the point and it really is a beautiful setting in a kinda blah part of town. If you come here, you'll have a great meal and maybe you can flirt with the server with the amazing beard. (Seriously, he was so good looking it was distracting) I'll definitely be back. I'd love to meet the owner next time. From all that I've heard about her she seems pretty awesome. See you soon!",

I had heard the chicken fried steak was awesome, so when our Friday morning Breakfast Club opted to check it out, I was pumped. I was really hoping my excited anticipation wasn't setting me up for disappointment. Located at 7th and Carson, this delight of a dining establishment is part of what is rapidly becoming a revitalized downtown and put off a trendy and hip vibe. I was anxious to read all about the chicken fried steak, but much to my dismay, it was not on the menu. What now? I had my heart set on CFS. No worries. They still have it. You just have to ask. It was, up to this point, the best chicken fried steak I've had in Vegas. It had a flavor like no other, and I have yet to figure out what it was. The tender, tasty meat was surrounded by the ultimate breading. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the eggs, well, they were just eggs. However, there is something they do with a pancake that words cannot do justice. Thick and hearty, with just enough crispiness around the edges. The service was friendly and attentive, with the beverages kept at the optimum level for consumption during the meal. Our party was split down the middle on the coffee. Some were impressed, while others weren't big fans of their joe. Expect to pay a little more, but it is well worth. Will I return? You betcha!",

The coffee was smooth yet a good bold flavor waiting staff was excellent place was clean but the best part was for sure the food. The seasoned potatoes were outstanding as well as the truffle egg sandwich!  I regret not getting the cinnamon biscuits as the tables on both sides got that and it looked amazing. Next time for sure.",

This is a very quaint breakfast and lunch joint that serves excellent food in a very approachable, no frills atmosphere. You can tell that the person that owns puts their heart and soul into it daily. How can you not love a place like that? The food is definitely good, just needs a little more refinement. Not bad in anyway, but the mexican eggs dish was good, but a little too saucy. It could have had a little more focus. The music could have been a little louder giving more atmosphere. Small things, little tweaks will take that place into legendary status. A definite must try.",

Chicken fried steak was fried way too long and seemed to have been plated out from under heat lamps, making it a barely warm dry mass of over-breaded mystery meat. As a forced substitute for the beignets which are not on the (just printed on plain white paper) menu for the winter, the cinnamon biscuits with berries were good, but again, the biscuits were cold and this fell apart like dry cake. And, staying with the theme, even the coffee was luke warm. Maybe the hipsters are going too far with projecting the Coolness into everything.",

I was disappointed that the 2 things I wanted to order were not on the menu that day (the beignets and the truffled egg sandwich). I had the downtown benedict which was delicious and the side of potatoes were actually crispy not soggy! My husband had scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. The sourdough toast was thick cut, buttery and delicious. My son got the pancakes which by far out shined everything. The pancakes were the best I've ever had, and I am not a pancake person. I have not had pancakes in years. I prefer waffles because I like a crunchy outside with a tender middle and pancakes are usually just soggy sponges. But these pancakes were absolutely amazing. They were crispy on the edges and so fluffy in the middle. The flavor was perfect - buttery and light, just needed a dab of maple syrup. I could not stop taking bites from my son's plate. Luckily, he could only eat 2, so I could eat as much of the 3rd one as I wanted to. This dish has made me rediscover pancakes!  We also had the strawberry cinnamon sugar biscuits. The biscuits were nice and tender but the strawberry sauce which was poured all over everything was too sweet and overpowered everything. I would have preferred a side of the strawberry sauce to dip the biscuits instead of it being dumped all over.  For a small place, it gets quite loud. It gets crowded too so expect a wait. The wait is worth it though, especially for those pancakes!",

That does not speak to how good the food is, so I will say directly that it is downright delicious.  It's definitely comfort food.  During our week in Vegas, we ate breakfast here three times.  The servers are offbeat types, and the decor seems to invite hipsters, so beware of pretentious hipsters, but we didn't do much about it except laugh a bit. From the chicken fried steak (eat the potatoes with ketchup, they taste much better), to the shrimp and grits (cheese or no cheese, both good), to the Kat's deviled eggs (deep fried and unlike any other deviled egg you've had), to the eggs chilaquiles, the food was prepared with an attitude of indulgence.   Basically dishes cost around $15.  I was not a fan of the coffee.  The servers were friendly, although one of our waiters behaved more like an actor trying to make an impression than anything else.  Overall, huge recommendation for this place.  It closes at 3pm I think.  We did not have to wait on any of the mornings we went, but we also tend to get up early (it opens at 8am).  By the time we left, there were sometimes people waiting for a table.",

A few friends and I stopped through on the last leg of a 10 day road trip for some much needed R&R--yes technically the road trip was supposed to be the R&R but something about driving 2000+ miles warrants a fun night somewhere.  After the debauchery had taken place, we needed something to eat. One of our group had been here once before, and highly recommended it.  I ordered the chilaquiles and was not disappointed..We all had some great coffees, and good conversation.  It was nice to be able to walk off the main strip and find a nice, calm, place to eat, with quality food.  I would definitely go here on my next trip to vegas.",

    "text": "I missed the field trip for a co workers bday here when it first opened.  Naturally, I had to redeem myself.  I just got back from a long drive to Amargosa Valley, so you can bet I was ready to EAT!  I had no idea that this place was purely a breakfast and lunch joint, tucked away in old downtown Las Vegas.  You can find Eat on the first floor of a small apartment complex where the area has been sprawling into an art district.  I only could find street meter parking, so if anyone else knows of any other parking options, do tell.  As I walked in, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I heard of this place from Anne, who is an amazing foodie expert that is not on Yelp and I been trying to proselytize her since.  The last thing I remember her saying is that they had an enjoyable experience except for the fact that the owner gave everyone a hard time about splitting costs between multiple debit/credit cards.  Other than that, she rated the experience a 3/4.  I was expecting more of a southern fusion breakfast lunch place.  Boy was I surprised to learn that this place is a trendy and modern eatery.  I was solo dolo so was seated at the counter.  Staff was friendly, but I already had my guard up waiting for the owner, whom I never ran into at all.  I still won't judge character based on anything but my own assessment, so was eager to meet her.  Maybe next time.  At the counter, I asked the nice girl across the counter what was good and she recommended the range free chicken sandwich topped with arugula, tomoatos, basil mayo and paired with a dill pickle and potato salad.  The Potato salad was one of the better ones I tried that ain't homemade.  The sandwich was delicious, but a bit drippy.  Still very tasty and I am a huge fan of arugula so you already know.  It was hot off the press and went well with my fresh (bottled) ginger ale by Bruce Cost.  A hint of spicy notes got my tongue's attention, but $4 is much for an 11.5 oz. beverage.  I love the decor which provided a hip yet serious look reminiscent of bustling citified diners in larger metropolitan areas like Seatown, Frisco, LA, Diego, etc.  Something I find foreign in LV and glad to see it finally arrived.  I can't wait to try other menu items and anticipating the next time I can share the experience with friends and fam.  I recommend y'all check this out if you are visiting or just hungry...a great representative of the LV foodie scene!",

I had the pleasure of ordering the brown sugar biscuits, just enough sweetness to them...I also ordered the truffle egg sandwich with chives potatoes. Oh my was it delicious!!! Truffle can at times be overdone but this was just enough. My husband had ordered the huevos (rancheros?) we forgot the name but that as well was amazing! We were very happy to have stumbled upon this place while in Vegas! Kudos to the chef!",

The decor goes along with the new atmosphere downtown is trying to create: trendy with a little bit of vintage to it. Everything on the menu sounds good to eat. The service is always fast and the food is fresh.   My favorite is the grilled cheese. It's enormous, and the bread is fluffy and perfectly toasted, and the cheese is good quality. I also enjoy the truffled egg sandwich if you feel for a breakfast mood. Both are completely satisfying and worth a try. My boyfriend loves to get the huevos motulenos. The combinations make it sound interesting, but the flavor is amazing. The waiters love to recommend to start off with the cinnamon biscuits, and I would, too.",

It isn't a traditional posole, but it does have a hint of spice that makes you keep going back for more! Just wished they gave me one or two more tostadas and chicken. My sister had the Cinnamon Biscuits which are always lovely to have! They were soft and the strawberry compote wasn't over powering which made it sweet and savory! Last but not least my all time favorite deviled eggs (couldn't find the name)! Those are to die for! They are amazing! Its a creative and upgrade version of deviled eggs!

    "text": "Hit up Eat on a Tuesday morning after Punk Rock Bowling and it's a well deserved 4 stars - wish I could have given them 5 but they pulled a boner in my book.  Really nice looking place - modern/industrial look.  Solid breakfast menu with American and Mexican items - everything was around the $8 - $12 range.  My brother got the chicken friend steak and I ordered the chilaquiles. The food came out quick and it was excellent.  Now, I have to start off with the fact that if you're looking for traditional chilaquiles you're going to be disappointing, luckily the menu was pretty clear what I'd be getting so I knew what to expect.  A few things that you could call non-traditional -  they used cheddar cheese (not cotija or fresca), they poured the salsa on the chips, the chips aren't cooked in the salsa, and finally they topped it off with a big old turkey sausage!   So you're probably thinking why I'd give 4 stars to this abomination???  Because it was delicious and it filled me up - what more can you ask for?  The chips were good and held up on their own, even without the salsa.  The salsa was delicious!  Spicy but not too hot - just enough to help with the mild hangover.  The eggs were nice and fluffy and they served a good amount of them.  The Sausage was a little on the sweet side, but still really good.  I tried a little bit of my brothers chicken fried steak.  The breading was nice and thick and tasted amazing.  The steak was a really thick cut - none of that thin milanesa type steak.  The home fries were top notch - nice and crispy on the outside and light on the inside.  Oh & the coffee was excellent as well.  So what was the boner move?  They brought the check about 5 minutes after the food hit the table - I hate that...  I don't care if they say \"no rush\" I still hate it.  Other then that the service was good, they checked on us a couple of times, coffee cup never went empty.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in downtown for breakfast.",

And she didn't tell me when I ordered that there were no refills. Had to keep asking server for straws. (She brought me water after I found out no more lemonade) Also ordered to eat ...the pancakes with the sausage on top and the deep-fried deviled eggs. The deep-fried deviled eggs were insanely delicious. :) Loved the kick of flavor and loved the concept of deep fry and deviled eggs. I wished there was more than four eggs. I wanted to eat a whole dozen eggs like that. LOL. The pancakes were dry and tasted like baking soda. We asked for more syrup which was a little jars and were not told that they were $1 each. The whole experience was good. Just put some sugar in the pancake mix and don't charge for extra syrup.",

Went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was only 5 min. I saw online that the Benedict, truffled eggs and cinnamon biscuits are a must-try. I got the Benedict, my friend ordered the chicken fried steak. I added on the deviled eggs after seeing them go by ( there's 4 pieces).   My Benedict was fair, the hollandaise tasted metallic in flavor, the English muffin was mushy, tomatoes were mushy, with the spinach and egg it as just a lot of much with a weird metallic flavor. I added a ton of salt and pepper as the overall dish was under seasoned.   The pancakes looked amazing, the chicken fried steak gave my friend diarrhea. Sorry tmi.   The main waiter seems tired and not very engaging. The hostess and cocktail waitress (although they don't serve alcohol) were very friendly, nice, chatty and fun.   Highlight: the deviled eggs were deep fried, crispy, topped with a spicy tobasco sauce and bacon. Sooooo good!   This hipster joint with a staff wearing all black with their messy hair with abundance of tattoos showing is more of a place to say you went to than a place with good, delicious and amazing service. I honestly wouldn't go back.",

OH MA LORD the potato chives were like mini baked potatoes with just the right amount of onions. I like that they serve you grilled cheese with this super thick bread that was crunchy and fluffy at the same time.   Overall the food was great the service at the counter was awesome. We were served by kevin and Kevin is the man. Kevin if you're reading this.. you're the man.  The environment was a little to loud for my liking but hey its a brunch place so its all good.. 5/5  Definitely would recommend to all the homies.",

Very good. -Huevos Motulenos: This was my least favorite of the things we ordered.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable.  Sauces were nice, eggs were cooked well, plaintain was a nice surprise but overall it was okay for me. +Cinnamon Biscuits: Plated really beautifully with berries and warm strawberry compote.  The biscuits were fluffy and delicious and the compote had just the right amount of sweetness. +Corned Beef Hash: If you're a corned beef type of person, it's the right dish for you.  It wasn't overly salty, it was cooked well and crispy, eggs were perfection.  Also the fluffy sourdough was just awesome to eat with it.  +Price: I think it was affordable (~$15+ a person)  +Decor: Very cute and hipster.    +Wait: Wasn't too bad actually.  I expected a huge wait on a Sunday but for 8 people, it was about 30 minutes.  The food came out very quickly as well.  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again.  I like getting away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.",

We came across Eat. and saw that the rating was in the top 20 of over 4200 restaurants in Vegas and just HAD to try this place... we were soooo happy we did and can't wait to go back for more on the next trip!  Upon entering, it's got a unique look and feel, like a kitchen and dining room.  The staff was all very happy, smiled and gave great service.  Restrooms are clean!!  The menu is AMAZING!  What I did was look around, quickly saw the Reuben that someone was eating and said I wanted that!  Otherwise, I'd still be sitting there trying to decide, because the menu was THAT GOOD!  We also tried their soups, the green chile chicken posole and the Black Bean Chili.  Both were very nice, but that green chile chicken posole blew me out of the water!  The many fresh flavors coming together in that soup were truly AMAZING! WOW!    The Reuben was one of the BEST I've ever had!  The corned beef on it was perfectly done, but the bread knocked it out of the park!  It was a HUGE, THICK and SOFT coupling of rye that resembled sour dough in it's softness, texture and size, but tasted 100% like a grilled rye - it was AMAZING!  The perfect amount of condiments were also on it, to include their amazing house-made sauerkraut!  The arugula Salad was very nicely done... lots of fresh veggies, greens and great flavors all coming together in a salad bowl - get it with chicken on top!  In all, this is an extraordinary experience... one that'll leave you wanting more!   EAT HERE!!!",

Of course, I still had the rungries. My biggest challenge? Picking what to order!  I settled on breakfast (because breakfast is the best!) and ultimately decided on the Truffled Egg Sandwich. First of all, it was ginormous, and came served with a GENEROUS portion of potatoes. They were more than happy to sub turkey bacon for regular bacon (thank you!) and it was great... not the kind of turkey bacon that leaves you feeling deprived. I did polish off the sandwich, but couldn't finish the potatoes, even with help.  For some of my friends who got toast with their dishes, wow, I have never seen toast so thick! It looked like thick cut French toast, but was just regular old toast. The ginger ale was also fantastic and I heard the coffee was, too.  Our server was delightful and knowledgeable about the menu.   My only wish is that I had time and room to eat through more of the menu, but I guess that means I will have to make a return visit. :)  Thank you for a fantastic meal!",

We were able to find street parking. I think it was $1 for every 30 minutes.  There is a waiting room inside with a couple of chairs and some people were waiting outside. It was a very windy cold day so we decided to wait inside.   I decided to go with their special of the day. The special was an egg Benedict. It was two beautiful poached egg with spinach and tomatoes with sauce. I thought the tomatoes and the sauce didn't go too well together. The potatoes were okay.   I also ordered the cinnamon biscuits. This comes with the warm strawberry compote. I only enjoyed the sauce. We didn't even finish this dish.   However, my friend ordered the corned beef hash. This dish was good and tasted like Chinese sausages.   Overall, there are tons of options and compare to others places I been to, this place is just okay to me.

After eating at some of the more unsavory spots stinking of cigarettes over the smokey gambling floor, it was refreshing to experience some quality food.   There was a little bit of a wait, but luckily we were waiting inside with a little air conditioning to keep us alive. While we were waiting we looked at the menu which was small and focused on a few varied crafted objects.   The place has a polished concrete floor. It has a modern factory look. However, something I thought was really cheesy was seeing someone's journal or notes posted all over the place. This was posted on a wall, taking up the space of the whole wall going on about some nonsense about seeing a flower or something. Here is where they were trying too hard to be cool. Another unnecessary decoration thing was the separate large bows for sides. This had a dramatic effect, but was awful when it came to actually eating the food.   I got the spin off a BLT. The bread reminded me of Texas Toast without the cheese. It was cut in very thick slices and was grilled on either side. When eating it, I felt it was a little too greasy because there was too much oil added to the bread. The sandwich had bacon, lettuce, tomato, and something else... I can't quite remember. I got the breakfast chive potatoes which were good in flavor, size, consistency... mmm.   There are several more items on the menu that I would have liked to have tried if I were to be in Vegas again sometime. I will return if I actually return to Vegas.",

But this particular morning I didnt feel like going to a buffet but rather wanted to go and try something local. Went on yelp to find breakfast or brunch places and Eat. Came up on the search. Given how they had outstanding reviews.. I knew it must get busy as the afternoon came closer.   Decided to try this place out. Located close to Fremont St. Street parking isnt too bad. $1 an hour pretty much to park at a meter. I got here around 915am. Though there were plenty of people inside already Im glad we made it before it got even busier.  Ordered two appetizers since I wasnt sure how big portions were and I wasnt too hungry. This place takes Deviled Eggs onto a whole new level. Deep fried deviled eggs was worth the order and the picture. Actually wished I had more room for a second order lol. The consistency was light and crunchy. I loved how there was different flavors giving each bite a bit of a kick to it. Very delicious and very well presented.  The warm strawberry compote cinnamon biscuits were amazingly delicious. Im not really a biscuit persoj but the texture of the biscuit was just perfect. Not too sweet or salty. Really hit the spot with just the right amount of cinnamon & strawberries. This appetizer was actually a big portion. Good enough to feed 3-4 people in my opinion if shared into smaller portions. But if ordering for yourself..  its enough to be a plate on its own.  Service here was really good. Very nice and came back to check on us a few times. Would definitely recommend this spot to any locals or even visitors. Just make sure you come early because this place gets packed pretty quick. Well worth the wait too if you had to wait for it.",

Still wanting breakfast (which I was happy to see they have certain breakfast things all day) we were quickly seated upon arrival.   Waiter was attentive but not annoying.   I got the shrimp & grits and my hubby got two eggs any style (comes with homefries, bacon & toast). After seeing the toast coming out of the kitchen I too ordered a side of rye toast.   EVERY SINGLE THING WAS DELICIOUS. The eggs tasted fresh, grits were good, pico on top of tasty perfectly cooked shrimp was delicious. The texture & flavor of the bacon was spot on. Even hubby remarked that sometimes one thing on the plate is the \"good thing\" that saves the dish but the potatoes, eggs & bacon again were all very well done. The toast is a very thick huge slice of tastiness! Even saw another guy at the next table holding a piece of toast shaking his head \"yes\" telling his friend that the toast was tits.   Would definitely recommend & return.    Added bonus coffee was really good too.",

And at the end when I paid my bill, I gave her a large bill with the exact change(coins). She took the bill in a rush with the money before I could explain how I wanted my change returned. So I wait, and continue to do so u til she doesn't come back. I was expecting $20 change but didn't receive it. So I go look for her. I ask her for my change and she thought the rest was tip. So I spoke to the manager handling the register, and she wasn't too nice. But said to me, why I would give more than my bill in an accusing way. I only had a large bill and had no small bills. I won't be coming back here and will be advising others to stay away too. After an extended discussion I eventually got my change back.",

    "text": "I'm actually being quite nice for giving them 4/5 because of the mediocre service.  Came here on a Saturday morning , so there was a bit of a wait (around 25-30 min.) but I didn't mind.  Atmosphere-wise , I love the charm this place has , just exactly what downtown needs :) It's located across Container Park so it's a pretty popular spot.  Food-wise , I already had my heart set on the cinnamon biscuits (w/ strawberry compote and powdered sugar) 8$. I don't think I ever had biscuits in my life but this is probably my new favorite breakfast food. The strawberry compote wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. DEFINITELY ORDER THIS. My friend who recommended this place to me also told me to order the truffled egg sandwich 12$. It was super good , everything was put together well. The scrambled eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly , and the mushrooms and feta cheese complimented the sandwich well. The chive potatoes were great , but taste better with the hot sauces provided on the side. If you don't like breakfast foods , they have soups , salads, and sandwiches available.  Service-wise , hostess was very kind and she reminded us of the breakfast specials today. Our server Roberto on the other hand , not so much. I don't like bagging on servers but we just got the vibe from him that he felt disinterested the whole time. Right after we were seated , he jotted down our orders and that was the last time we saw him. At least our food came out quick but he never checked up on us , asked how was our food , or any refills. Literally three different people asked me in less than a span of 5 min just to ask if I was done with my potatoes although I was still eating them and even had a fork in my hand. Three people can ask me if I'm done with my plate , but not notice my glass is empty.   If you're looking for a breakfast place , I recommend this place because the food was excellent. Best breakfast I had in a long time. Just don't have high expectations about service. Also note , when it's busy they will only accept one credit card. Hostess offered to split the bill in half for two cards though.",

    "text": "Located in LV's hipsterville area by Container Park, eat. is a delicious little spot for breakfast or lunch.  Arriving on a Saturday about 11:15 we were immediately seated at a small two person table and given menus.  Looking around at the cute interior, I noticed the plant boxes and old bottles, kind of a mid century modern lighting and mismatched chairs. Not feeling very Vegas in aesthetic, which I can very much appreciate, I looked forward to our meal with anticipation that it would be equally appealing.  Orders placed were the huevos motulenos, delish, both green and red salsa atop over easy eggs, crispy country potatoes joining the plate. My hubby had turkey sausage, country potatoes, scrambled eggs and a few huge pieces of Texas toast. We started off with the flavorfully airy and decadent cinnamon biscuits with a sweet strawberry compote, wow!  We noticed the other plates brought around looked very good also, the pancakes were ginormous and the chicken fried steak looked good (or so says my hubby, I don't fancy red meat).  Service was quite good, the place was clean and well maintained.  Total bill was $39, minus tip.  Will return!",

So tasty, they didn't even need butter or syrup (not that we didn't add them!).  The truffle egg sandwich: rich flavor, crusty good ciabatta, huge.   The chicken fried steak: not greasy and surprisingly light, with a crispy breading and just the right amount of (sausage?) gravy to not overwhelm.   Then, my faves: the cinnamon biscuits--like their version of French toast in biscuit form, and SO GOOD. The sweet (but not cloying) compote and fresh berries made it a delicious treat. Tasty bacon perfectly cooked, crispy but not crunchy. DEVILED EGGS! The white fried in panko, the devil on top with bacon crumbles. You can't miss this dish, a good appetizer or dish on its own (I ate most of ours).  The space was perfect to enjoy the food in, open and roomy, with great creative touches on the wall. I like the open kitchen and bar seating. Everyone there was also friendly, our server was so fast and also helpful, and the food came out fresh, hot, and quickly. Good for my hungry self.   I hear they get packed on weekends, so get there early. On a Wednesday morning, we got right in, and there was plenty of seating. Even with a wait, it would be worth it. I hope we can squeeze in another morning visit before we leave.",

First, food and drink. My wife was accidentally brought an iced tea instead of coffee. That turned out to be a good thing, because the iced tea is awesome - I ended up drinking more of it than the pop that I actually ordered.  After a bit of a wait after ordering (the place was almost at capacity but there were a handful of tables free), our breakfast arrived - beignets for my wife and chicken fried steak for me. The beignets were good if a bit doughy. My wife said they were better with the jam. I assume they're made from Cafe du Monde mix since there's a box of it on display behind the counter - I'd rather see them make them in-house.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the sourdough buttered toast, eggs and \"smashed\" potatoes that came with my chicken fried steak. The gravy was more flavorful than other places I've had it (which is a lot - I'm on a kick for it lately), and the meat was obviously freshly breaded. But, it was really quite tough! Whomever is back there making it needs to smack it with the tenderizer a LOT more. A LOT MORE. BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF IT. SERIOUSLY.  At the end of our meal, we got to talk to Chef Nat personally and hear about her plans for eat's expansion - including the dog-friendly patio outside!  For me, the experience was more like 3.5 stars - but I'll round up! It's on the high end of \"good\" with lots of potential to be great. eat doesn't need Downtown Project's money to prop it up - it's strong enough to stand on its own. We will definitely return when the patio opens to give it another try.",

It's located on the ground floor of a divey motel but don't let all that fool you.  The food is outstanding.   Everything is prepared in a gourmet fashion so if you're looking for diner quality food go else where.  I really enjoyed the Juevos - it had New Mexico green and red chile in it!  Talk about yum.  The bacon was applewood smoked and cooked to perfection.   Great coffee too.  Service was friendly, not too quick on the draw my friend was complaining but I was ok with it.  Definitely recommend over all the tourist traps.",

There were a lot of locals, which immediately made me feel like we made a good choice. We didn't have to wait as the hostess happily seated us near the kitchen (which by the way is open, so that was fun). We ordered drinks and then placed our order with a friendly waiter. I chose the \"killer\" grilled cheese with tomato soup and my boyfriend had the BLT with avocado. They both came out of the kitchen in record time... we were not expecting them to be so quick, especially with a packed house! Both dishes were amazing. The bread is to die for! It really made the sandwiches. I loved both dishes (had to sample) but I will say the BLT may have been the winner. It was also served with homemade chips that were especially good. The prices were also refreshing to someone who has been gouged by restaurants up and down Las Vegas Boulevard. A new \"must visit\" in this city for lunch!",

Around the area of Eat is Old town and you can't go wrong spending time in this area;  moreover if you like Roulette go to El Cortez .50 chips, 2 $ min...you can take $20 and if you play your game right you will have paid for break fest at Eat !  The staff was as good as the food!   Sometimes if you are lucky the head chef and owner will be sitting outside just listening to comments to figure out how to make Eat even better!  ENJOY!",

Really???  Needless to say, that was my last day eating there and I will never go back.  This is unfortunate because I would have brought many of my fellow colleagues with me as the week went on and now I will never patronize this place again.

Not meaning to sound like a prude. Plus the end of my toast was too hard.  On the bright side it wasn't that much for all that I got. Side of eggs. Side of bacon. Side of toast. Plus an entree salad. (Of which I forgot the name but it was their special.) Goat cheese, almonds, greens, strawberries, buleberries, and their housemade special vinaigrette which I also forgot the name. Oh, plus water and an Arnold Palmer.  I also wanted to add, every server came up and asked if I was okay at least once. *thumbs up* That's good service.  I'm pretty sure it was a simple error to have forgotten the silverware. I mean, I did get there 30 min before closing.   All in all, delicious. :) second time here and I'm digging it.

It's away from the Vegas strip which can be a bit too loud for one to enjoy a nice meal but at the same time its so close to Fremont St that has a lot to offer. The restaurant is located exactly across from the back of the Container Park, which by the way everyone should go to.   The wait time here is tricky, it depends at what time you show up. But don't be taken back by the amount of people waiting, every second you wait will be worth it once you go in and eat.   The menu is very basic, but everything sounds great and if you are like me you will find yourself looking at other table sot see what people ordered. So everywhere I turned everything looked amazingly good. For appetizer, we had some biscuits with strawberry sauce drizzled with confectionery sugar....TO DIE FOR. As soon as we took a bite of the biscuit we knew that we were in for a good eat.  For main course i went for the pancakes with an apple sausage and my brother and mom went for the breaded steak, yes STEAK. When they ordered they missed the part that said steak so when they went in for the cut they say that it was not a fried chicken breast, it was steak. And holy moly was that a big piece of steak. Both of them could of ate from one plate. The steak came with two eggs and potatoes. As to my pancakes, it was a simple dish, but boy were those pancakes huge.  They gave me three I only ate one and a half. I couldn't do it. And let's just say that for the price I did not mind not being able to finish it all.",

I adore the deviled eggs... trust me, get them. The sandwiches are wonderful. Coffee is mighty tasty. Anything with the green chili sauce is a win. My friend and I like to try a few things and split them so we can try out more items. I would suggest you do the same! it's all so good. Staff is always friendly and you won't wait long for a water or coffee refill. I like the vibe. Close to Fremont but just enough away to know you are in a local hot spot and out of the tourist trap area. Food is REAL. Staff is friendly. Not expensive. Go for it!",

The biscuits here are a must have the cinnamon biscuits come out nice and warm with strawberries covered in a strawberry sauce, it has a great balance and is delicious! We got the special eggs Benedict and the truffle egg sandwich. The eggs Benedict was alright but the sandwich was good. The portions are pretty large so don't order too much. The first time I also got pancakes and couldn't finish so I knew better this time around. The orange juice, coffee, and strawberry lemonade are all pretty good here too. Everything else seems pretty good so can't go too wrong with anything else.",

The grilled cheese with tomato soup is perfect comfort food and incredible if you step up and add some of their smoky thick bacon.   The menu changes seasonally with items rotating in and out. Plenty of vegetarian options for those so inclined. And brewed ice tea.  The clientele is eclectic trending to hipster. Parking can be tricky downtown and be prepared to feed a meter. And expect a wait if you're trying for a weekend mid-morning breakfast. Totally worth it.",

Made sure we got to eat before their big brunch crowd or any crowd that would've gathered before and after the parade. It didn't take long for us to get a table - probably like 10 minutes after giving the hostess our name.  Cute setting that definitely reminded me of a school cafeteria with a hipster spin.  Everyone constantly checked on us during our meal, which was cool to see another establishment have all this teamwork. I think we had Gary as our server, and he was pretty cool. He recommended we have the Deviled Eggs as a starter, and we were not disappointed. In fact, the brother ate 3 out of the 4 we were supposed to split. Anyway... The little brother had Huevos Motulenos, and I had the Corned Beef Hash. LOL. We definitely switched plates at one point to have a taste of both orders. Funny thought popped in my head: \"I feel like I'm back in Cali eating brunch... Vibe and fresh ingredients to make scrumptious breakfast!\" I gotta admit that the brother's plate was yummier than my staple though. I didn't think capers and peas would taste well with bananas, but it was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. My corned beef was pretty good. I mean you can't go wrong with this breakfast staple when it's fresh and not drenched in some kinda grease. LOL. I loved my Sourdough Bread that came with it! There was the sour taste to it - small yet evident. I liked how it was soft 'cause crunchy edges can get kinda annoying, even if I like a bit of texture to my food elements. Might I also add that my coffee was definitely freshly brewed, and I just appreciated how it didn't remind me of a certain coffee chain. XD",

When our friends told us they were staying at The D and wanted to meet for breakfast, it was the perfect opportunity to check it out -- and I'm glad we did.   Location - eat. is in the heart of DTLV, right next to Container Park. Easy walking distance from the DTLV Hotels and Fremont St. If you drive, there is an ample amount of street parking for $1/hour.  Ambiance - The restaurant is small and gives off that hipster vibe (reminds me of a restaurant you'd find in LA or San Diego.)   Service - We were quickly greeted and seated. *They do not take reservations, nor will they seat you until your entire party is present!! Our servers were friendly and very attentive throughout our entire meal.  The Food - We started with the Cinnamon Biscuits w/ the Berry Compote that everyone raves about which definitely lived up to the hype. I ordered the Truffle Egg Sandwich which was also delicious. It had the perfect amount of truffle and the feta cheese added just the right touch. It came with the chive potatoes that they're known for which were seasoned perfectly and very yummy. My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and said he really enjoyed his dish.   We will definitely return!",

Shrimp and Grits: pretty much self explanatory, served with bacon strips, butterflied shrimp, topped with over easy eggs and homemade sauce. The eggs were something different but a nice touch.

Everything is fresh, the staff is friendly and the prices keep the regulars (I'm certain they have many) happy. I opted for a Veggie Burger, which was fantastic.

Great place to get some good comfort food downtown. It's a bit hard to find, but 5 minute walk off Fremont street. If you're downtown or heading down that way I'd strongly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. This place has a menu that offers a broad selection from pancakes with chicken maple sausage, grilled cheese on Texas toast with tomato soup to a mozzarella caprese style chicken sandwich. Various side dishes are offered. The food was nicely presented and tasty. Tasty passion fruit unsweetened iced teas is available to whet your appetite. Come early or come late. Usually busy at mealtime. And yes there is counter to eat at where you can watch the creations being made. A pretty good way to start the day. I also think that for the quality and quantity, this place has really good value.",

    "text": "eat is a really cute, hipster spot for fresh, tasty breakfast and brunch meals. Located conveniently next to the Downtown Container Park, eat provides gorgeously plated and well-thought out dishes (mostly).  He got the huevos motulenos, which is a great menu option. This dish consists of two eggs over-easy with red & green new mexico chiles, black beans, peas, pico, feta, and sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. Vibrant, assertive flavors and nice presentation. The huevos motulenos is also a quite generous portion, as with everything else they serve.  I ordered the tofu scramble with mushrooms and home fries. His dish was definitely better than mine. I thought the tofu was a tad underseasoned, some salt and other spices would have made it less plain. Also, I was expecting tofu scrambled so that it actually resembled eggs; however, their version is actually cubed. I think stringy, egg-like bits would have made this dish more successful because the thinner, creamier texture would have soaked up any seasoning better. Still good, though could be better.  We shared the cinammon biscuits, and these babies were fantastic. The biscuits are smothered in strawberries and blackberries, which I loved. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the biscuits were thinner, and more similar to shortcake. Worked really well in this dish, and again, really beautiful plating.  Looking for an American breakfast with a twist? eat is a great choice. Overall, the food is delicious and service is good. The ambiance is also lively and cheery.",

Located in downtown Las Vegas, it is hipster, modern, and artsy - quite refreshing compared to the Strip.  The staff was also kind and welcoming, answering all of our questions about the neighborhood and sightseeing.  As for the food - we started with the cinnamon biscuits which were the highlight of my meal. The serving contained 4 halves which was perfect to share, and the strawberry compote topping was divine.  As for my main meal, I got the dwblta with tomato soup. The sandwich was HUGE and I could barely finish half of it. The contents of the sandwich were fresh but the bread was too thick for my taste and heavily buttered.   Overall, I enjoyed the meal and the experience but found the food too heavy for my taste. I'm not sure if I would return given the chance, but I do definitely recommend venturing off of the strip and exploring this downtown area!",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times. Here are a few tips if you haven't been:  You're almost always going to have to wait. Some of the food is awesome. Some of it is not.   Here are some favs--  Grilled Cheese w/ kickass tomato soup Chicken Fried Steak 2 Eggs any Style - especially with their sourdough. It's amazing.  Pancakes  The other food we've tried is very...okayish. Especially the shrimp and grits. The grits have little to no flavor. And they're extremely runny. I prefer the grits to be thick, creamy and buttery. That's usually the awesome part about shrimp and grits. Maybe it's just me.   And my biggest complaint here: the service. Not that it's slow. It's just plain fucking weird. From the hostess to the servers. They're so nonchalant, and it's bizzare. The hostess does not greet you when you come in, and they don't tell you \"good bye\" or \"thank you\" when you leave. And the servers...one of the guys, we've had twice. He barely even talks to you. He comes up and gives you this look like, \"Well? What do you want?\"  He's even stuck his head in between ours to ask if our food was okay...and it was literally inches from my face. Who the fuck does that?! Also, we put our card down to pay because he never checked on us...he looked at it, pointed at it, and then looked at my fiance. My fiance responded, \"Could you please close us out?\" Still, no response. He took the card, knodded and walked off. Please tell me that's NOT weird or unprofessional. No question mark needed. It's rhetorical.   The best thing about this trip: a lady serving us drinks (which she happened to be super nice and helpful) told me about the cold brew they had. I ordered it and it was amazing.   I'm sorry, but when this seems to be a regular occurance here, I'd rather take my business elsewhere going foward. I don't want to go somewhere where I know I'm probably going to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. There's a few amazing options right across the street if you're looking for somewhere in that area.",

Living life on the edge... Anyways. Ordered the truffle egg sandwich,.. was blown away. I'm always nervous to order anything egg in the first place but when you add the word truffle, the game changes. It was delicious! Service? Great! Their to go cups are so cute too.

All of these things could have easily been fixed and we could have looked past them had the customer service actually been existent. No one would come out to talk to us about the problems,  the chef couldn't be bothered to come out, there was no proper management to handle the complaints. The hostess came over and literally laughed at us for having these complaints, after laughing she said \"well I don't know what you want me to do about that.\" They offered to comp $2 for the missing avocado on two Btla's. We could have looked past all of the mistakes had the hostess not had such a poor attitude. We will never go back to EAT. I would sadly never recommend anyone to support this restaurant simply because the owner/chef doesn't value her customers and doesn't have a proper hospitality team.",

The staff was great, courteous, and attentive and other than me getting chives on my sandwich after asking for none, I had no issue.  I was disappointed that they have a somewhat limited bfast menu during the week (no eggs benedict) and they discontinued the beignets, which were the two things I specifically came for, thus the docked star.  The coffee was good and they have Truvia which is a def plus. I got the truffled egg sandwich, which was surprisingly bland for $12 and could have used some cheese or something for flavor. I made my own concoction of syrup and tabasco, which I know sounds completely weird, but is absolutely delicious! The chive potatoes were also a little too much on the greasy side for my liking.  The stars of the morning bfast show were the cinnamon butter strawberry compote biscuits, which were amazing if not pricey @$8 for four. Maybe it was the fresh blackberries?   In any case, I don't know that I'd go back as you have to pay for street parking and it is in kind of a shady sectionof DT. But, I did enjoy what I did experience for the pretty penny it cost.",

I have been twice, and both times there was wait. It didn't take more than 15 minutes for us to be seated. The real wait takes place after you're seated. There seems to be a good amount of servers floating around, but the service isn't all that great.  The first time I went, we had the berry biscuits as an appetizer and I order the chilaquiles. The berry biscuits are great. The biscuits are a tad bit dense, but the compote is divine. The chilaquiles were awful. Besides the chips and eggs, the dish was far from what I was expecting. There was some sort of mango concoction that was not appealing to my palate. Just awful!  My next time around I order the pancakes. If you want good plain pancakes, look no further. The pancakes are fluffy and well-seasoned - can you say a pancake is well-seasoned? Anyway, these bad boys don't even need syrup! I also got a side of cheese grits as recommended by the waiter. They were disgusting. Not enough cheese and the were extremely clumpy. They reminded me of instant cream of wheat.  Overall, I do like Eat. I will be back to try other things.",

I've eaten there at least 10 ten times since it's been open and I have yet to have a bad meal or service. And I've also rarely seen a chef/owner spend as much time at their establishment as Chef Natalie does. If you want breakfast then get your lazy ass out bed and get there before 11. The pancakes with real maple syrup are a revelation. The grilled cheese and tomato soup as well. What I refer to as a basic breakfast is also top notch. Perfectly cooked eggs, thick bacon, homemade potatoes and really delicious, fresh bread for the toast. The chicken fried steak is a masterpiece. I took my friend there and he and the chilaquiles and his reaction was thus \"Dude, that might have been the best breakfast dish I've ever had,\" EAT is the ish and I would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I live downtown so it gives me no pleasure to say this but eat is the most tragically over-hyped restaurant in the city. I think people like the story more than the food--they have to. Local strip chef hooks up with downtown project, opens original concept in an up-and-coming part of \"new downtown\"...it just works. Add to the story a cool space, friendly/hip wait staff, and an intriguing soul-foody menu--it's a perfect combo. What everyone seems happy to overlook, though, is the shockingly mediocre quality of the food. This is classic over-promise/under-deliver territory. The shrimp and grits are soupy and bland. The truffled egg sandwich is a travesty of over-cooked eggs, slapped together mushrooms--a two dimensional card trick. The public has for some curious reason been swooning over fried dough served with a sliced-in-half strawberry. Smoke and mirrors, folks. Eat is testimony to just how powerful the desire for a place to be great exceeds it's actual greatness. It's not all terrible. The coffee is tasty. I enjoyed a po boy once. But the food is simply average and in no way justifies the national attention this place receives. The cooks are not in command of salt or technique; the dishes are just flimsy. I so wanted to love this place, and I still champion the forces and reasons that gave birth to it, I just don't care to eat there. The food is fine. It's average. But it in no way rises to the level of the restaurant's fame. MTO is already better. Let eat continue to be a hub of attention and activity, but let's stop pretending its because of the food.",

Without the music playing, you could barely carry on a conversation.  With the music playing, forget about it.  And I'm sure the mothers here loved that they couldn't talk with their children during brunch.  What were they thinking?

We ordered:  Truffled Egg Sandwich - Pretty good, heavy & rich with full of flavor. Can't really fuck up a breakfast egg sandwich.  Free Range Chicken Sandwich - Has that healthy vibe to it but still full of flavor. Maybe I was tripping but the tomato soup tasted like there was apple sauce in it.  Golden Brown Pancakes - One of the best pancakes I had in my life. When it's fresh it has that fried crunch but so \"moist\"....whatever you do, try to eat all of the dish because taking it home and reheating it, it loses its magic...  Everything here was solid but there was nothing over the top special about it. It's one of the few places in Las Vegas that specialize in brunch and they execute well enough on all fronts that it would make you come back time and time again.",

Monday morning we took off to Eat. for breakfast about 9a.  For 9a, off the strip, on a monday- I didn't expect them to be so busy.  But they were hopping!  We were promptly seated and looked through the amazing menu.  I couldn't ask for a better send off meal.  I wanted to try everything - but stuck with the simple 2 eggs.  So good.  I am not a big bread eater.  Typically when my meal comes with bread - i take it or leave it.  However - at Eat. they do the bread in a skillet - similar to how you do a grilled cheese.  I devoured every morsel of bread.  Everything else was amazing too - but that bread.  I cant wait to go back to Vegas so I can visit again.",

I love the sandwiches and would always lean towards any egg dish, they're done very well from my experience.",

Usually the line is out the door for this place, but this time we were lucky and got seats at the kitchen bar top. We ordered a chicken sandwich and a breakfast sandwich (not sure what it's actually called). Both were decent, but really nothing exciting. My tomato soup was lukewarm and pretty salty, I couldn't have any of it.  Our server was super sweet and despite the hustle and bustle, we were well attended and she always made sure our coffee was full. Cute restaurant and all, but the food just wasn't quite there. In addition, the chef looked super stressed out and unhappy being there, which seemed like it made the rest of the staff unhappy. It's interesting watching all that while sitting at the kitchen bar top.   Overall, if there's no wait here and you're hungry, stop by. But there are plenty of other options in the area that serves much better food.",

As I kept going, as a restaurant that's from a local culinarian owner they usually wow us with new things. And I haven't really been wowed except the first time. It's cool that they have a small menu. But I'd love it more and go more if it were seasonal or changed every once in a while.   I would still recommend people to go at least once! The atmosphere is still great. And servers have always been good to us.",

Unfortunately, since it broke the underlying teeth, i now need to have implants put in to hold the bridge.

    "text": "Not bad, but not the great, yumminess we were expecting from all the five-star reviews.  The deviled eggs were the best thing we ate - you should definitely get them with whatever else you order. They remind me of the scotch eggs we can get back home, but better, because mayo of course! The deviled eggs are what make this a 3-star instead of 2-star review.  Overall, everything was fairly tasty, but there were some fatal errors for us in each dish. The truffle egg sandwich was actually pretty good, but had hardly any discernible truffle flavor or fragrance. If it was just called a bacon and egg sandwich, I would have been happy with it, but instead was disappointed. The waiter suggested we add avocado, which was a good call, but be warned: it's a $2 upcharge, which we only found out when we got the bill.  My kids both got the chicken fried steak, which was seasoned well enough, but dry and tough and didn't have enough gravy to make up for it.  Finally, the chilaquiles were more like breakfast nachos. I wanted the layered, casserole-style, baked goodness where all the eggs, cheese and tortillas all come together. This was a handful of chips thrown in a bowl and smothered with scrambled eggs and ranchero sauce. Again, it was tasty enough, but not the chilaquiles we can get in LA.  The service was decent, for managing such a busy, bustling morning crowd, but I would have liked to not feel like if I paused in between sentences the waiter was going to turn around and run to another table. Three different times with two different people I had to call the person back because we weren't done ordering/requesting before they started to walk away.  Again, it was good, but not great.  If a friend asked, I'd probably say try it - we might have caught them on a bad day - but we won't be back.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of first visiting eat. when it first opened several years ago. This was before I was a Las Vegas resident but was in town for work. I was blown away then by the level of service and passion that went into the dishes then, and it has yet to disappoint me now as a resident.   I've been back twice since moving here, so I suppose I'd call myself a regular at this point? Especially having only called Sun City home since early June. Sharing the Chicken Fried Steak is necessary because it's huge, but also a tasting experience that you want to remember with someone. The gravy is tantalizing and the potatoes are incredible. The corned beef hash is good, but I'm more of a shredded Corned Beef fan and this dish is small chunks. The toast is thick cut and perfect for soaking up that egg yolk.   My most recent visit took me to the sandwich side of things. The chicken sandwich is simple, the bread perfectly toasted. I'd have added avocado, as the pesto didn't add as much flavor as I had hoped, but the menu clearly states that modifications will be politely declined. The grilled cheese should be framed. The thick cut toast filled with melted cheese makes me weak in the knees. And it's ideal for dipping into that cream based tomato soup.   My heart belongs to the deviled eggs though. They won me over since my first visit and I'll always come back. Anything that claims to make giraffes dance is bound to be a winner. These eggs are no exception.",

I ordered the shrimp po'boy and they bring out a sandwich with tons of jalapenos lettuce and different salad like toppings with 3 of the smallest shribbled up shrimp I ever saw in my life po'boy shrimp are deep fried and there not the size of guppies then my wife ordered the grits and shrimp and they bring out a dish that looks good but was way over cooked as far as the shrimp my wife took one bite and vomited at list they where nice enough to help her to the restroom. Dont believe the hype on this place. over priced food and very small portions. This is another small restaurant tryin to get over on the community EAT at your own risk.",

The seating area itself is fairly small, but much worth the wait! They specialize in breakfast and lunch (brunch) foods that are served all day until close at 3 p.m.  The food was great! Very fresh and presented well on the plate. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking to get away from the strip, or for anyone looking for great food! The prices are a little lower than the standard $30/person meal in Vegas and definitely worth the visit!",

Although one of the waiters was extremely rude to us and rolled his eyes a few times. My girlfriend had her baby with her and the waiter seemed irritated when looking over. Then when he brought out her food (which was not the right order) he was pissed off.  And then again..more eye rolling when she told him he had the wrong food. He gave us the impression that he didn't enjoy being there and was mad he had to deal with customers. Which is really too bad because it's a great place. I tried to look past it and brushed it off,  figuring he was having a bad.   Later that aftenoon, I told my husband that I found a new restaurant in Vegas that had really good food, off the strip. My husband was excited to try it and we decided to come Sunday morning.   We arrived a little after 8 in the morning and were rudely greeted by the same waiter from the day before. As soon as we walked in,  he seemed bothered and even more annoyed with my daughter who was crying. He looked right at her and rolled his eyes at us quite a few times on the way to be seated. By the third time my husband caught on, looked at me and asked me, \"do you see what's happening,  do you see him rolling his eyes?!\" i I told him yes, that's how he was with us (me and my girlfriends) yesterday.  My husband then stopped the waiter as he was bringing over the high chair and told him, \"we don't need your rude service \" and left.   I can't tell you how upset we both were because this happened.  My husband really wanted to say more to the waiter because he felt that it was more of a personal attack on our little girl.   We live in Southern Highlands which is pretty far drive from this location. As parents we find it hard to find family friendly places in Vegas. I was hoping this would be one of them, but sadly it is not.",

It's like magic at every bite.  Potato is also cooked perfectly, I normally hate potato and refuse to eat them but their version are really good! Flavorful yet not overly seasoned. I used to take it to go and eat it later and even eat cold it's still so good!   Chicken sandwich $12 It's actually very light to my like, without any extra/excess spread or sauce, but yet good quality and fresh ingredient.   Country fried steak, $15 I don't think it's chicken, it's more like beef, it's prolly the only country fried steak you can tell what kind meat in there... It's kind dry/hard for me but we ordered too much food and by the time I tried it was cold already.   oat $7 decent    Coffee $3  Iced coffee $4, decent.  It's less packed on weekdays and usually no wait , staffs were really attentive and service is always fast. It's across from container park and plenty street parking (meter).",

We went in and it was a super cute place very vibey. Open kitchen concept with very modern interior. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak without the gravy. I ordered the special of the day which was a prime rib hash. The pictures are attached. My dish was yum but my hubby's wasn't what he was expecting.  Not sure he knew what a chicken fried steak was( the ultimate oxymoron dish).  Who named this dish chicken?! I actually think he thought he was ordering chicken and waffles. I also ordered a single brown sugar pancake. OMG,this was like a round donut. Pancake bliss!  I absolutely have a love affair with pancakes.  Frankly speaking they usually have me at hello.  This one was one of the best I ever had.  Only better was in Phoenix at butter.  Service was good, not extraordinary as they forgot my pancake then brought it after giving us the check. Hello??? Good thing it was so good or I would have been a bit put off. Overall, worth going to but the area is a bit sketchy.",

In addition, I ordered the corn beef hash and my boyfriend ordered the two eggs with a side of bacon and potatoes. Everything came out delicious! The staff are super friendly and attentive with checking on us frequently. Even the manager was extremely nice and stopped by our table to make sure everything was fine.

As for the location it's nice to have a place to walk into without venturing into a casino and with a nice open air setting and even a patio for when it's not so hot outside.    I had a basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast with coffee.  I just love a simple breakfast and the eggs tasted great but the bacon was too crisp and the potatoes seemed dry and this may have something to do with it being a heated up plate, sure I got a warning but I don't really see this as a great sign to begin a meal.  The hostess was nice and the greeting from the waiter was prompt but after that it seemed to fall off as I was served without given any condiments until I flagged someone and asked for them, and I never got a refill on my coffee.    I really did want to like this place and I would be willing to give it a try again but today just didn't seem to live up to the hype of what I've heard.",

Afterward you can walk 2 blocks to container Las Vegas or The Mob Museum. Some will think the area is dicey, however, I felt very safe. Check out this restaurant and Downtown Vegas. No I'm not paid, but I just like the vibe of this area and especially this restaurant which is why I came down there in the first place.They have a sign in East that I want to use in my gentrifying n'hood \"Be Nice or Leave\"",

This time on a Monday morning we arrive 15 minutes before breakfast ends, they say we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated for lunch to start, and mind you there are plenty of tables. They only took about 7 min to seat us, but they werent serving breakfast anymore. I came for some breakfast food, not an expensive sandwich. And breakfast is supposedly served from 7-11. Not 7-10:45.  And a side note, they should open the darn patio seating. It's completely shaded and there's still another month or so before it gets too hot out.",

It is definitely picking up on the new vitality rought to downtown.  Chef Natalie Young had a vision to bring new energy just off the Fremont Street Experience and she nailed it.  Hunting for the restaurant at Carson and 7th Streets is part of the allure.  Just look for the shipping containers and there you are!  When you walk into the restaurant you feel this upbeat vibrancy and it makes you feel like you have found a very cool lunch spot that only the \"in\" crowd knows about.  It has a simple, no frills, down home kind of everydayness about it.  The emphasis is on the food and the great service.    Our friend is a regular at eat and excitedly told us about all the tasty options available for our lunch choices.  I decided on the Shrimp Po Boy with chips and passion fruit tea.  The shrimp was good sized shrimp, which seemed to be grilled and seasoned to perfection.  And yes, I ate the whole thing.  Yum.  Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks filled while we enjoyed our time visiting and eating.   I can't wait to come back and try the other items.  The mac and cheese is calling......",

Staff was friendly and very accommodating...we were a large party of 11, and most of the tables are set for 2-4 but they still managed to seat us in under 30 mins.  We had missed the breakfast menu, although a lot of their items are still available for lunch. Had the chicken, mozzarella sammy that was very tasty and filling along with their homemade potato chips and an AMAZING pickle. I kid you not I tried stealing all the pickles on the plates around me. The potato chips are perfect to munch on too, I ended up eating mine and part of a side order someone else ordered.   eat. is the perfect spot after a night of being out late and drinking too much on the Strip. Dark roast coffee to wake you up (YES!), friendly attentive staff, delicious food you can't stop eating...From here on out this may be our new spot to hit as we leave Vegas instead of chowing down at an overpriced buffet.",

He (I'm sorry, I don't remember your name!) was friendly, helpful, funny and knowledgeable. All very appreciated!  I ordered the DWBLTA with chips and an iced tea. Friend ordered . . . oh yeah! Breakfast! Some breakfast sandwich that he had several things removed from, and he was so excited to be able to order breakfast. I'm happiest when my friends are happy.   Server was back in a flash with our drinks. It was tropical passion tea with an orange slice and mint sprig it in it - delish!   In the blink of an eye - server was back with our lunch! YAY for fast service on the lunch hour!   The DWBLTA was the best I've had. Fresh absolutely everything, with lots of avocado (not one skinny slice like some places!), a schmear of - I think Russian Dressing? And the bacon was amazing. YUM. I had the chips as the side, and they were awesome! I never clean my plate, and I cleaned my plate. My friend was amazed.  Friend was sure they were gonna mess up his breakfast sandwich with his \"hold this and that\" business - they did not. It was perfect, and he said delicious.   Server was quick with our check and cashing us out. In fact? It was 12:35 and we were done, and able to just chat! FUN!   I'm happy, eat. I'm really, really happy! I'll be back. In fact?

It wasn't until after we decided to eat here (no pun intended) that we looked into the reviews... All I have to say is WOW. So glad we decided to eat here (no pun intended...again)   We started with the Deviled Eggs. They were delicious.  I had a three egg Californian omelet (added an egg because I am a big guy and this big guy likes eggs)  It was very delicious but even better was the bread. It is from a local bakery. The size of it puts Texas Toast to shame... It was HUGE! The potatoes that came with the eggs were fantastic. I am not really a breakfast potato guy but they were delectable. I also got the coffee which was pretty smooth. I liked it.  My wife got a BLT with avocado with an egg added  (For a tiny little thing, my wife likes eggs too) We could have easily shared the sandwich it was so big. She said she loved it but it was way too much for her to eat. (She ate half) She loved the bread!  Both dishes came with homemade chips that were really good.  We both would recommend EAT to a friend!",

When I walked in and saw the cute, retro, rustic decor, I said, \"looks like a place in downtown Phoenix.\" When they walked in, they said, \"looks like a place in DC.\" Either way, I think that's a plus.  Bonus point for being located in the most random old hotel/motel off 7th. The brunch menu is small, but good. We sampled the eggs benedict (I can't remember the name, but it was really good. Canadian bacon, spinach, etc...), beignets (yum! not for the paleos, of course!), and the biscuits and gravy. All were hits. Service was friendly and prompt and all the employees were happy to greet our toddler. The prices for food were reasonable (~$10 for a bfast entree), but I agree with Karlie that the drink prices were kinda high. I think my OJ was almost $5. I might take a star off for that, but I'd add it right back on because they had a guy singing and playing guitar in the corner. And he took requests.",

We ordered an appetizer of panko-breaded deviled eggs (very nummy), which came out 10 minutes after the entrees. At first it seemed like one man was our server, who was seemingly annoyed to be asked for almond milk with our coffee, and then it switched to a woman who was not much friendlier.

Our group had the chicken fried steak, a prime rib hash, and my delicious dish, the huevos motulenos (not sure if I spelled that right). The mix of flavors were paired beautifully with the unexpected sweet banana, feta cheese, black beans, a milder verde sauce with a zippier red on top over easy eggs with a side of onions and potatoes. Get a side of avocado to top it off and some fresh squeezed orange juice and get your day going right! Be sure to get there before 11 am for breakfast though because there is a cut off.",

Went with coworkers and couldn't decide between the BLT or the Banh Mi Chicken,  Our waitress suggested the Banh Mi and said it was delicious and a bit spicy.. Yay.. bring it on.. I love Banh Mi, and thought this will be a great little twist with chicken. NOT at all what I expected. The chicken was pounded flat, fried and chewy, almost as though it was leftover from last week and reheated. The chicken was hot, so when put on the sandwich bread it wilted the vegetables. They were not crispy and there was no spice. The bread was also overdressed.   The homemade chips are some of the best I have ever had... crispy, and lightly salted for great flavor.     The service was friendly and fast.   Not going to let one sandwich stop me from going back,.. Looking forward to another lunch.  Oh, if you're going to discuss any business during lunch, forget it..a great selection of music plays, but it is loud.",

We had to yell throughout the entire lunch, as did the hostess when she called our name to be seated.  With concrete floors and very little fabric the decibel level is just too high.  Don't go if you plan on having any conversation during your meal. Otherwise, the restaurant is a nice addition to downtown.  Also, pricey for lunch. $40 for lunch for two.",

    "text": "First off, I just want to say, what a lively and well thought out title you have!! It  does absolutely nothing for the ambiance, environment, or atmosphere.  So we go into this place that closes in 45 minutes (2:00pm) and we are seated with an effortless menu in our hands.  If you have seen the 90's movie \"My Cousin Vinny\" then you had a choice of: Breakfast  or Lunch I had the lunch, my mother had the lunch, and my sister had the breakfast.  The prices were steep for no apparent reason.  I'll tell you why.   This \"cafe\" sits behind the newly constructed Container Park near the downtown area and gives off no connection to the \"urban\" look that the whole community is looking for.  If this place is not known by word of mouth then one would think it was an old relentless leasing place trying to scrape money to stay and keep its doors open. You would also think it has been here at least since the early 80's. Good for them for putting their name out there by social media, but I honestly don't see how this is going make it for long.  The food screams help at the top of its lungs because they are in desperate need of taste, flavor, and palate cleansing.  With a menu that only has maybe and I mean MAYBE 3 or 4 choices for lunch or breakfast that their descriptive plate names would coincide with the food that you get. I feel like the kitchen is saying, \"heh heh heh, just kidding no soup for you and if you want pico de gallo then cut up your own tomato.\"  Yes folks, I asked for pico de gallo but all I got was chopped up tomatoes in a ginormous bowl with one scoop of pico in it (i got charged $.50 for one scoop of a tomato!!) So anyways, we get our food and it is simply not- that- great.   I could've easily gone to one of the local casinos that always advertises steak and eggs for $4.99 or even pancakes for cheaper price.   However, the point of going to this place was to seek out some truth that lies behind the whole commutative urban development surrounding the newly improved downtown area.  This new area is supposed to cater to the locals that is why they replenished and rejuvenated this whole neighborhood in the first place.  Well, hello, I did expect the prices to be more for me, the local, not the tourist.   It doesn't matter anymore, what does matter is that if you want to keep your high prices and rip off your customers from not serving urban stylish food than don't stay open too long, and move to the strip where you can rip off all the tourist you want.",

And by \"hole-in-the-wall\" I don't mean a dive joint (which is still fine), but something that's not a massive restaurant that all the tourists go to, but the locals don't really care too much for... this place fit the bill. It's a small restaurant in Downtown, right underneath/behind an apartment building. It's nice and simply decorated on the inside, very \"modern-hipster\" (if that's a thing). It's clean though, and that's a major plus for small restaurants. The service is super friendly, my gf is picky but they had no issues fulfilling all of her needs. The food is also really good, I don't remember what we got but it was great. After breakfast my gf asked for some fresh cut strawberries and they brought it out with some dipping sauce, she was absolutely in love and asked for more to take to the hotel. If you're in Vegas, go here.",

Secondly, the staff need to smile more and be happy to be there. The wait staff both male and female behaved as if they had somewhere more important to be and were not timely in the needs of the table AT ALL. No utensils, we grabbed our own. Most importantly, kitchen staff should listen to wait staff; after all, the wait staff are your eyes and ears. Never seen a Chef so arrogant, that he argued with the waitress- as if she would make up the food being cold. Come see us at the table next time... a simple apology from the Chef, himself, would have been nice. The waitress was very kind; however, because I work in the service industry; note to ladies: when there is a couple sitting at the table, your back should NEVER face the woman and if there are two EMPTY CUPS, they both should be filled, not just his!!! The place has great potential. Food is about the experience and your staff represents the experience. They can enhance it or TANK IT! I think with fresh new staff members that would like to do their job and a kitchen staff that knows time, plating, and service goes hand in hand- this place has the potential to be the best well kept secret.",

It is alive with all the sounds of hustle and bustle coming from the open kitchen area and the echoing sounds of the warehouse style seating area coming from all the seated patrons. In short it's loud in here, definitely lively but wouldn't suggest this place if you are planning on having a conversation. The service is amazing so much so I thought at one point I had three servers since more than one person came to check on us. Now to the food. I ordered the downtown egg Benedict and there famous pancake and my husband had the two egg special. The plating of both were beautiful and the portions were generous but the flavors were not very memorable. Overall from a score of 1-10 I give  this place a 5",

    "text": "I stopped by for lunch today, and was glad that I did.  I'm happy to see a downtown restaurant getting on board with clean eating and offering free range chicken meal options.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the place opened on Monday, and just four days later, it was super busy during the lunch hour.   It's definitely a hip, trendy lunch spot. The restaurant isn't very big but has several different tables to eat at, plus a counter and a rectangular bistro table (I think called the community table or something like that).   I had the free range mozzarella sandwich with potato salad and a pickle.  Overall, it was good but I thought my chicken was lacking just a little bit of flavor so I added some salt and pepper to it.  The potato salad was really good, not too mushy or mayonnaisey.  My lunch mates both had the chicken caesar (also free range), which they said was delicious.  One friend said that the dressing was fresh and tasted like it was made from scratch.   The one downside was the noise level inside the restaurant.  Once the restaurant filled up, it became really loud and we had to talk loud (and basically shout) to hear one another.  I wouldn't recommend more than four people to a table during the usual lunch hour.   Eat is a great place to get your grub on.  It's cool, it's heathy, and there's plenty of parking around the block.  The passion fruit iced tea is also very refreshing, and dare I say, better than the one at Paymon's???",

The decor is wonderful - done in greens and natural woods. Very pretty.   We went there for lunch and there wasn't much on the menu to choose from but that was fine by us as everything we order was perfection. We tried the avocado BLT and the chicken sandwich. Simple but so fresh and the flavors melded so well together.   I would recommend this place to everyone.",

There were 3 of us and unfortunatley everyone was stuck on pancakes so we didn't get to try any of the other breakfast entrees.  We did order the beignets, don't exepect Nawlins style beignets. EAT's are dense.  None the less delicious, and the vanilla marscapone served with them is delish. We'll be back to try out the rest of the menu. The service was good too.  Non-Food They did a great job with the interior remodel.  Urban/Industrial vibe. All the comments about the location-get over it, it's downtown and that's what makes it great, and EAT's a great addition to downtown.",

They did get busy later, but I felt they didn't care much about our comfort since they knew the rush was coming.  Ehh.  Back to the food.  It was really delicious!!  My son's pancakes were SLAMMIN and I had chilaquiles.  Red sauce was different, but still good.  No espresso, but had coffee instead and it was ok (not my style but the waitress said it was good and strong).  We all loved our meals.  Our meal was pricey so heads up!  My son's apple juice was $4!  If you're prepared with the cost, the wait or small table, then you'll be able to better enjoy the service and great food.    Great find in downtown vegas, I'll be back!!",

It's located downtown off 7th street and Carson Ave.  While the neighborhood isn't the best, it's still safe and worth the drive downtown.  The decor is hip and trendy and perfect for the new emerging downtown feel.  You can tell the waitstaff both work and play downtown, and they are all very friendly.  The menu is short and sweet and everything is delicious.  I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed.  Not only is the food good, but the presentation is great.  The grilled cheese and tomato salad is great and flavorful, as is the free range chicken and mozzarella sandwich.  If you're going for breakfast, either the pancakes or the huevos motulenos (their most popular dish) are the best choices.    The Chef/owner Natalie is always there greeting people or helping put out orders and you can tell she really loves what she does and that this place is her baby.  I'm going to continue dragging all of my friends here and making sure everyone I know gets to experience eat.!",

When we first arrived the manager/hostess told us that the patio/pet friendly portion was not open due to short staff; but rather than turning us away she made us feel right at home. She personally took very good care of us; making my fur baby's first dining experience a great one. The food was amazing! I really wasn't sure what to order so I went for my all time go-to veggie burger. It rocked!! The sprouts were fresh, avocado perfect. The tomato side salad was to die for and our deviled egg appetizer was awesome too. All in all great food and great experience! Kudos to you guys! I for sure will be back time and time again!! Special thank you to the manager! I feel terrible that I forgot to write down her name but she has excellent people skills and super sweet. Refreshing.",

I don't know if he thought since we were a young interracial couple that we wouldn't be good tippers or what. My girlfriend is in the service industry and used to be a waitress so we are very big on service, most times its more important than the actual food, and if the service is good I can guarantee that the tip will be 30% plus.

The place has a very down home and uncomplicated industrial/ modern chic vibe set on the edge of redevelopment zone of downtown.   First off, I was bummed that we had just missed breakfast (stops at 11) and was not that intrigued by the lunch menu. We were completely caught off guard that we had several different servers within a matter of minutes when the dining room wasn't that busy. Then there were a few snafu's in that my gf got the served wrong side dish and I a chicken Banh Mi when I ordered the Tofu.   The food itself was uneven. The chips were a highlight. The Banh Mi was fine. Potato salad was too creamy. My gf's chicken (on the chicken sandwich) seemed boiled and lacked any real flavor. She rarely complains about food.   I am hoping that there are some jitters that need to be settled with both staff and kitchen and that it will be here the next time I come. I would love to see it improve and thrive, but for now, it was really missing the mark.",

The grilled cheese sandwich was interesting, but outsized, with Texas Toast bread. The \"kick ass\" tomato soup was tasty, but the serving was miniscule and was spooned into the bottom 3/8 inch of a bowl that dwarfed this miniature serving.  I enjoyed most a taste of my friend's homemade fries.  I enjoyed least the obvious \"rush act\", and was horrified when the owner approached our table to verify whether we had been served our check, or not.  Since we had already paid, this was a fairly obvious, and very obnoxious, sign that we were to leave.  Since we had only been seated and had only finished a few minutes earlier, my friends and I thought that this was very inappropriate.

It's a little off the beaten path, 2-3 blocks from Freemont and off the Strip in general but this place was PACKED on Saturday morning. I came in a group of 6 people and we were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait; no big deal to us since the place looked very busy. When we did sit down our waitress was super friendly and we got our drinks quickly; the sparkling strawberry lemonade was possibly the best lemonade I'd had on the trip. I got a Chicken Fried Steak and I have to say it was the best one I've had at a restaurant ever. The gravy was what you want in a gravy; those superb lumps of bacon/sausage with that peppery bite. The steak was cooked to perfection, tasty on the inside and well seasoned with an awesome amount of crunch on the outside all served on top of eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were perfectly cooked, soft on the inside and that golden sear on the outside. Waitress was super friendly and had a great sense of humor! The wait for the tables in a big group is worth is 100% and if I ever go back to Las Vegas this is definitely on the list of places I would eat at again.",

There is nothing soft around to absorb sound, so don't expect to have a conversation.  The music did tone down after a bit...but not because they lowered it.  Everyone who does talk has to raise his voice to be heard, so the sound escalates as the restaurant fills.  I had to put in the earplugs I always have with me.  My chicken pot pie used puff pastry underneath and on top of the filling.  The filling was okay; I didn't detect a lot of chicken in it, but it wasn't all sauce like some--mostly veggies I think.  The bottom crust couldn't be crispy, and the top crust wasn't either--so I just ate arouond the edges.  The chicken sandwich was ordinary, and the potato salad tasted more like the packaged salad in a regular market.  The one I make myself is much better.  It's unlikely we will return.  Breakfast is enticing, but ends at 11 am.",

    "text": "Eat has become my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. There's never a problem with parking (metered but always close), though you may have to wait 15 minutes if you go during their busy time (but that would be the case anywhere). The service and food have always been great. All the servers I've ever had are polite, courteous, friendly and engaging. I've only had breakfast there and always get either the huevos motulenos or pancakes, which are both delicious (and perfect hangover food), and generously sized enough that I end up taking some home with me for a second meal later. I can't speak to the lunch menu and have heard mixed opinions. The decor is modern and industrial yet cozy. When I last checked they don't serve espresso drinks, which is a bummer when you're craving a latte or cappuccino, but drip coffee will always suffice when I want caffeine. It's also a great off-strip spot to take out of town guests, I definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "We had a party of 9 visitors except for my niece who lives in Vegas. We had both vaguely heard of some place downtown that had good breakfast.  Searched out EAT. We were not let down!  The staff was friendly and pitched in to handle our casual group of mostly boomers.  I admit my memory is not that good so I'll mention only a couple of items.  One of the guys had the chicken-fried steak and he loved it!  Enough for two if you are a light eater. I had the golden pancakes and I WANT the recipe!  My only disappointment was the chicken sausage.  Please stick with pork sausage or bacon.  Others seemed to really enjoy their dishes.  The food quality is tops. Two things kept me from making this five stars: the coffee had a strange taste and the place is noisy, due to the polished concrete floors and minimalist decor.  But all-in-all I will definitely go back.  We love downtown Vegas and are happy to see progress every time we visit.  Don't forget to EAT!",

    "text": "Eat is a neighborhood restaurant tucked away in downtown Vegas with a great, friendly atmosphere.  Some excellent dishes.  Some mediocre dishes.  But it's a little hit or miss on the customer service.    I love this place and I love that it's located downtown.  Finally, a great brunch and lunch spot in the 89101.  Finally, a neighborhood place not catering to Southern California tourists.  It's awesome.  It's friendly.  And it's become so well-known that it can be tough to get a seat.    The lunch menu is solid--great sandwiches and salads. The grilled cheese is excellent with thick Texas toast style bread and sharp cheddar.  Simple and awesome.  Nice fresh tomato salad on the side.  The roast beef sandwich is also tasty.  Fresh and thin roast beef with bright blue cheese on perfect bread.  For brunch, there's a lot of excellent options and some that just miss the mark.  The eggs benedict is delicious.  The chicken fried steak was decent, but not brilliant--more of a kitschy choice but not particularly well done.  The main disappointment is  the huevos rancheros dish.  It's an awkward attempt at culinary creativity with peas and sauteed bananas mixed into the savoriness of eggs and rancheros sauce.  This place has an excellent, inviting atmosphere. In a downtown focused on daytime business and nighttime drinking, it's a nice spot for the locals.  A spot to meet and spend time connecting with people.  And there's a charming porch to sit on when it's not baking hot outside.  If there's a main setback, it's that Eat can't handle the lunch rush that happens Mon-Fri.  There's so few great food options in downtown Vegas that Eat is crowded every day.  If you're coming for lunch, prepare to wait.  And try to keep the number of your party to 2 people.  The hostesses have a hard time figuring out how to seat parties larger than 2 in an efficient way.  Know this going in and you'll have a great time.  Bottom line: 4.5 stars for the excellent atmosphere, friendly service, and generally solid menu.  Minus one star for occasionally cranky customer service, long waits at lunch, and some mediocre dishes.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch on a Sunday! It was already packed at 10 AM so that tells you something. It was a 5-10 min wait for three people.   I ordered the Huevos Motulenos, but I got to try the beignets, chicken fried steak, the housemade chips and the benedifct.   I personally didn't enjoy the Huevos Motulenos. I found the flavors and consistencies to be contrasting. Black beans and peas were too hard, salsa didn't complement the dish, there was hardly any egg, the tortilla was soggy, and the bananas confused the entire dish.   The beignets were really fluffy, but they would have been better if made and served fresh. They were barely warm when they got to our table. The strawberry jam was really good, though.   The Benedict was decent. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.   The Chicken Fried Steak was definitely the best plate. The gravy was seasoned deliciously, I just wish there was more of it. A little too much breading but it added good crunch and flavor.   Prices ranged from $11-14 for entrees, so I wouldn't come here on a regular basis. But when I do I'll be sure to order the CFS or Shrimp n Grits.",

    "text": "I was in town last week and wanted to try a new place for breakfast so around 11 on saturday i started going through yelp to find something exciting.  So I thought the storefront looked odd and when i drove by it, the restaurant is underneath either a motel or a bunch of apartments which was even more odd because they were kind of run down.  So i parked in the metered parking across the street and ran across to check this place out. When you actually walk, its like you're in a different part of town. Inside its clean and new and actually ....nice? Like hipster nice. It was definitely a surprise.  I sat at the bar and yelp told me to get Huevos Motulenos so i ordered the Huevos Motulenos.  Which are awesome. There is so much texture and flavor going on in that plate that its really hard to describe.  It was definitely one of the best breakfasts that i've eaten recently. And because i knew that i wasn't eating anything for a while i ordered a side of pancakes which i thought would be the size of my hand. They weren't. They were the size of my head. So i barely made it out of there alive but i powered it all down like a champ.  On a side note, i don't know why people go to restaurants like this and just order bacon and eggs and then say \"wtf bacon and eggs. I mean..it tastes like bacon and eggs - i can make this at home. What a rip off.\" If you just want to have a crappy meal like two strips of bacon and an egg, learn to cook and stay home. Go get a 99 cent breakfast burrito from mcdonals or whatever. Don't come in here and wonder why bacon and eggs at a restaurant tasted like bacon and eggs made by everybody everywhere EVER.  I would definitely come back to eat here again.",

There was a little bit of confusion throughout the meal with service (a random waiter tried to refill my BF's Sprite with water and we were brought the bill twice--once by our actual waiter and once by someone else). But I suppose it's better to be paid too much attention to than the opposite! My boyfriend had the corned beef hash, which was really great. Very flavorful. I had the traditional breakfast and it was fine. The bacon was good, potatoes weren't as flavorful as i'd hoped, and the jam was similarly blah. All in all, we'd go back but it might not be our first choice.",

First it's a breakfast and brunch place and they stop serving brunch/breakfast items at at lunchtime?  Say what?  How difficult would it be to keep your grill open to cook breakfast items?    Second, the waiter appeared annoyed after he was told I ordered coffee (my friend even heard me) and he didn't hear that I wanted coffee and water.    Third, the food was marginal at best.  Maybe because I didn't have any appetite having spent the night and day before at EDC but man, the black bean soup tasted like sea water.  They salted the heck outta that beans till it flew outta the cuckoos nest.    Two of my friends, didn't like the Tomato Soup, which looked like they put some care into it's presentation, but the taste buds don't lie.

They were warm and crispy on the outside with a nice fluffy center. They were served with a raspberry sauce and a wonderful vanilla mascarpone. The mascarpone was not too sweet and tasted great with the raspberry sauce.   I ordered the shrimp and grits while my husband ordered the black bean veggie chili. Both were superb! The shrimp and grits are served with apple-smoked bacon and two fried eggs. It is the perfect combo.  I was really expecting \"not so great\" service after reading reviews of EAT. Our waiter, Justin, certainly proved those reviews wrong. He was super friendly and we never felt rushed. He kept the drinks coming and sat down to chat for a couple of minutes. I will definitely go back to EAT when I am in Las Vegas again.",

    "text": "So we did something naughty after realising every single restaurant in this area had 45 minute Saturday morning waits. We walked to each restaurant and put our names in, then checked Yelp to see who would ultimately win our business. It was a tie between Eat and another, but the staff at the other joint was so cold, we went back to Eat. Glad we did! Ended up being worth the 45 minute wait. (Yes, we took ourselves off the other lists in person within 15 minutes. We aren't sooo awful.)   We ordered grits (good), pancakes (great), and corned beef hash n eggs (freakin amazing). The coffee was excellent and the service was fast and delightful.   We found street parking 2 blocks away. It was metered but all of them were broken and okay to park at.   Noise level is high but not off-putting. If you can only get a counter seat here at high peak times, take it. It's still awesome service.",

I ordered the truffle sandwich and Jared had the roast beef sandwich.   To me, the truffle sandwich was like the the main act you come for but the roast beef was like the surprise opener who blows your sock off.  Did I enjoy the truffle sandwich? Yes. That's what I came for! But I went in with no expectations about the roast beef sandwich and it was juicy and delicious.  My only caveat about this place is it could use some AC! It was too damn hot to not have AC going. Overall though I was very happy with the food!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Eat for a while, so I was very excited to experience what they had to offer. We got there a hour before closing so everything was pretty quick but not rushed. The menu is quite small compared to other places but they do have a nice variety of items for breakfast and brunch. I love breakfast food, so I had to try the cinnamon biscuits, but i also love a bit of savory too so you can see my dilemma. I decided to solve all my problems by getting a side of chive potatoes and chicken apple sausage.  The cinnamon biscuits were not what I expected but they were a nice surprise. They were more cakey rather than flaky and light. I was expecting a bit more cinnamon in the biscuits but the sweetness from the strawberry compote balanced it out.  The servings of chicken apple sausage and chive potatoes were more than enough for one person and had great flavor. I almost forgot about the sparkling strawberry lemonade which was served with a paper straw, something I hadn't seen in a restaurant before.",

WEIRD tip: but I recommend all my fellow vegans to bring a side of mayo with you if you're getting the veggie burger, it makes it so much more delicious! You can also mix it with the ketchup & you have yourself some serious awesome sauce! LOL",

This past Monday, had the time to visit with a group. We were quite pleased with our items.  Chicken Fried Steak- Deliciously satisfying and was cook just right with out being over or under cooked. The actual batter had a good texture and the gravy was seasoned well and gave the dish a kick.  Beef Hash- Overall, a good dish and paired well with the potatoes. The bread that came with the dish was toasted well and not burnt with butter.  Truffled Egg Sandwich- The was a stellar dish. Consistent flavor throughout with the bacon being crispy in texture but not burnt and paired well with the wild mushrooms, feta cheese & chives on a ciabatta bread. A side of seasoned chive potatoes was really good.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience and our server, Jessie was amazing and his assistant Christopher too. It was a bit busy on a Monday morning but the staff had their A game on.  2018 Yelp Review #14",

The industrial look meets comfy place to hide from the Vegas heat means you feel like you're sitting down for a meal from the family. We tried first the cinnamon biscuits. Homemade biscuits dusted with cinnamon and sugar and crisped up on the griddle with strawberry/ blueberry compote. It tasted so farm fresh and sweet. The biscuit was soft but the outside was crispy which held up to the compote. Then I got the oatmeal with candied pecans. It was warming from inside out. I definitely want to go back and try the burrito- but it was the side of my face so i couldn't chow down that hard this time of morning !!",

The staff were friendly, the menu was clear and easy to read. Really my only complaint was trying to narrow it down to ONE menu item to order.   Eventually, after about 10 minutes of debate, I settled on the huevos motulenos. As I sat there sipping on some amazing coffee, regretting a few of my less than stellar decisions from the night before, once the food arrived... all regret washed away!!   It was just the right combo of sweet, spicy, and comfort masterfully presented on a single plate!! I didn't put my fork down until that plate was clean!!  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Eat. as a MUST for anyone looking for a truly kick ass breakfast/brunch joint!!",

I had the truffled egg sandwich with dill potatoes (well done).  Sandwich was good and big. The potatoes were the bomb, though!

We tried to get into EAT for brunch 6 months ago, but the line was over an hour wait, so unfortunately we had to pass.  This weekend we went for an early breakfast and yea, only a 10 minute wait. Cool decor, hipster type, a tall community table in the middle, we got a small table. We were properly greeted, drinks taken quickly and had really great service. Variety of menu options from sweet to savory, love the quality of ingredients, farm to fork focus and ingenuity of flavors and ingredient cimu I had the Huevos Multalenos, easy over eggs over black beans, sweet bananas, feta, corn tortilla smothered in green Chile and savory red chili sauces - so delicious, served with chive home potatoes. Variety of savory egg sandwiches/truffle mushroom topped, chicken waffles, chicken and grits, huge pancakes and more! Street parking but easy access.  We will be back!",

ANYWAYS Arrived around 12:15pm on Sunday and there was a small wait. Service was great. Quick and helpful.  My friend and I shared the deviled eggs and truffled egg sandwich. The deviled eggs are SO. GOOD. It's basically deep fried egg white topped with the yolk toppings and bacon. Made perfectly. Could have eaten more but the cholesterol... This was definitely something I've never tried before and for $8, no regrets. The Truffled Egg Sandwich $13 + avocado $2 was pretty good too. I enjoyed the scrambled eggs.  Honestly, this place is over my normal price range for brunch but I'll definitely come back for the deviled eggs!",

    "text": "Ahhhhhhhhhh....That pretty much sums it up for me about eat.....just one big delightful comfort food sigh.  My first time here and damn was it good.  A really nice place with some really amped up comfort food.  My dish, the Chicken fried steak with potatoes was very memorable.  The way they make their potatoes really took it beyond the standard breakfast potato from most places.  The potatoes are cooked perfectly and have this nice, light char on them that adds an extra depth of flavor.  Also mixed in with the potatoes are highly caramelized pieces of onion and garlic, adding even more flavor to the mix.  So damn tasty.  The chicken fried steak was super crispy on the outside with a gravy that was creamy and spicy.  I would love a big bowl of gravy by itself and eat it like a stew.  The portion was also pretty huge so it could easily make two meals (or just one meal for someone like me.)  My friend, who's a vegetarian, ordered the truffle egg sandwich which also looked good.  I didn't try it but he said he liked it.  Actually, his sandwich comes with bacon so I got to have that so I did get to try something off his dish.  The bacon was good. :)  One thing I want to try on the next visit are the pancakes.  The table next to us ordered this and those are the thickest pancakes I've ever seen, they were an inch thick each! They looked super fluffy and has some chicken/apple sausage with it.  Next time for sure.  Another cool spot in the middle-of-being-revitalized downtown area.",

They have deviled eggs that are dipped in batter and lightly fried. I am not a huge fan of deviled eggs so I was skeptical, but they were amazing.   2. The cinnamon Biscuits. A really good twist on traditional biscuits and tasted more like a really good dessert to me than an an appetizer. Good size portion with 4 biscuits.  3. The dwblt- the best blt I've ever had served with really good kettle style chips. The bread really thick and high quality and the ingredients tasted fresh.   4. The country fried steak- my husband LOVES a good country fried steak and he said this is the best he has ever had. I got a bite and I would definitely recommend. The beading was amazing and the gravy was really thick and delicious.   5. The tomato soup- so good with the grilled cheese.  Our group didn't order a single thing we didn't love!   It's only open for breakfast and lunch and it fills up fast so make sure you plan ahead.",

The restaurant is small so it gets pretty noisy, but who cares when the food is delicious. Ordered the Killer Grilled Cheese + pancakes on the side. And the bf got Cinnamon biscuits + potatoes and chives.   The grilled cheese was killer on sourdough bread and came with tomato soup that wasn't too tomato-y (which I definitely appreciated) the pancakes came with house maple syrup in a sealed individual jar :)   The food was great, but the service was constantly busy so I guess it was fine...regardless, I'm visiting again when they switch up the menu every so often so I can try others!",

They get a lot of the business lunch crowd during the week so can be a little wait at noon.  To avoid recommend going at 11:30a or 1p.

Tons of folks were patiently waiting to get a seat and after about 15 mins we got sat inside near the kitchen with a view of the entire place. The experience began outside with a blue grass band which was awesome!   Service was on it and it was insanely busy. Nice job guys!   The food - I was really impressed with all of the flavors and everything we tasted was delicious. The freshly squeezed orange juice started everything off and I was very pleased. I ordered the eggs benedict which were phenomenal, they came with tomatoes, spinach and ham. The breakfast potatoes here were out of this world. I definitely had a food orgasm as the yolk dripped onto them. I haven't had a breakfast this good in a long time. My man ordered the eggs with bacon & chicken apple sausage with a single pancake. All items were really great. They have their own syrup! It wasn't too sweet and very rich, loved it!   Overall we had a really great time and left smiling. We had to walk this brunch off because the portions here are huge. I cannot wait to go back to try something else to see if this place is the real deal. I believe it is :)",

In keeping it honest, everything was truly delicious.  My only ding, is I personally though the Strawberry Biscuits sauce, could have been a bit sweeter.  Besides that, things were spot on.  We got there at around 9am.  Lucky too, because as we were leaving (around 9:40AM) that front door was swinging.  Speaking of front door.  Nice touch on the wording as you exit: ATE!  Nicely played.

We ordered Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak and the Corned Beef Hash along with coffee, water and a soda. Everything tasted good and the only reason for only receiving 4 out of 5 stars was the fact that after our server asked how everything was initially we never saw him again.  We attempted to flag him down and the lady who brought our drinks over initially. Nobody came by to offer refills and we had to ask the lady who bussed our dishes for our check. When our server dropped off the check, he did just that without any acknowledgement what so ever.  I would definitely return for the food, it was delicious but the lack of attention to service did spoil our experience a little.",

I'd much rather have an apple and sit in front of the TV or drive to work.  I must have been possessed when I decided to come to eat.  There was construction going on too.  It's a small place so I can imagine the line later during the day or weekend.  I ordered a truffled egg sandwich.  My friend wanted eggs benedict but they only serve it during the weekend so she opted for the Mediterranean egg white frittata.  Truffled Egg Sandwich: Scrambled eggs with mushrooms, feta cheese, 2 strips of bacon and chives with a side of smashed potatoes. The bread was crispy...I would normally skip half of the bread but it was good that I had to eat the whole thing.  The saltiness from the bacon, the creamy mild tartness  from the feta, the earthiness of the mushrooms and chives with fluffy scrambled eggs...I. could. not. stop. eating. 5/5  Mediterranean Egg White Frittata: I normally prefer egg whites and have nothing to do with egg yolks.  This is my idea of a perfect breakfast minus the olives since I'm allergic to them. It has spinach, tomato, sprouts, feta cheese with an English muffin.  My friend was lucky it had olives, otherwise, I would have been all over this too. 5/5  The service was great.  The chef/owner was there.  Each breakfast plate is about $11.  My advice is to bring coins for the parking meter.  To enjoy good food is my style.",

Eggs Benedict, corned beef hash, bacon and eggs, oatmeal, biscuits and pancakes. Oh and 2 coffees.  The oatmeal wasn't the greatest and a little on the cold side, but that's okay.

One of my best friends was in town this weekend and we decided to meet up for breakfast here. Parking is ample, but be sure to bring coins with you since it's all metered. The hostess has lots of change if you do need to break a larger bill, though.   The wait wasn't long and 5 minutes after putting our name in we were seated and perusing the menu. The menu is succinct, but despite how small it is I was torn on what to order. It all looked so amazing, I couldn't decide. It didn't help to look around the room at others either because they only succeeded in proving that it was all great. I settled on the shrimp and grits while my friend got the eggs benedict. The guys next to us ordered the chicken fried steak and I know it must have been amazing since they devoured them in silence with content looks on their faces. I was so excited for our meals to come.   I don't typically dig the hipster vibe, but this place really had a warm and welcoming feeling to it. I loved the decor and hospitality and especially enjoyed the live music quite a bit as well.   On to the food. Absolutely amazing. I savored every bite and so did my egg benedict-eating friend. We enjoyed every last bite and I was also quite a fan of the freshly brewed passion fruit tea. Once we were done with our meals, we couldn't resist continuing to watch all the great things coming from the kitchen, despite how full we were. I cannot wait to come back again really soon. The prices are great for the quality of food.",

I don't eat grits but wow the shrimp and grits is awesome! The portions here are pretty good. The breakfast potatoes are so good. Toast is BIG toast. I love it. Seating may take a while this place is small. They do have outdoor seating as well. We waited 1 hour and 30 min one time for tables so we just walked over to the container park til it was time. (That's how good the food is) I guess you can say it's worth the wait.",

We ordered both of the chicken sandwiches that are on the limited menu only to discover they were obviously made from frozen chicken breasts that were rubbery and tasted like plastic.  The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.  We vowed never to order from this place again as the food definitely does not match the prices charged, and as there are so many other lunch spots to pick from, we won't miss this eatery.",

We went in around 10:30am on a weekday because this place gets really busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours. We got our bill and put 2 cards for them to split the check. They ran both cards and included a note about check splitting, i.e. \"Dear check splitters, when we are slammed we will only take one card per table.\" I found this note after-the-fact quite rude, especially since they were not slammed. I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy. The policy was posted nowhere prior to paying our bill, nor was the note there when they brought us the check. I find this to be a ridiculous policy as far as customer service goes, but what was the point of telling us AFTER they split the check. Was this meant to \"shame\" us? If they are trying to let us know for \"next\" time, no worries with the multitude of restaurants available in Las Vegas, neither one of us will ever go back, that was so rude.",

My server said the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo was just okay even though the host told me it was awesome. I should have listened to him because I honestly was not impressed. The soup was watery and didn't taste like a homemade tomato soup. The \"grilled cheese\" which was too huge to even fit in your mouth was covered in butter...gross. I actually got it with eggs and turkey bacon to try and make it more of a full meal. To be honest it was okay, nothing I couldn't make at home though.  Overall I would say my experience was average and probably would not run back for multiple reasons. No free parking-you have to pay to park to eat here, no validation what so ever. Plus the food was just average, nothing blew me out of the water here. The staff was quite nice to deal with but that is not a reason to come back to a place wouldn't you say?",

There's plenty of parking which saves me a headache.  Unlike Le Thai or that awful \"La Comida,\" you don't have to walk several blocks. The decor is adorable and the music is awesome. Just an all around great atmosphere and the staff is super friendly.  Now to the food- This place has the BEST chicken caesar salad in town!  Its amazing...sliced chicken breast, shaved parmigiano, real bread croutons, and a tasty dressing. The arugula salad is a close second. Chef Nat's version of the shrimp po boy is delicious as well.  Its healthier than a real po boy (Lola's still has the best) but its definitely legit.  And let's not forget the green chili chicken posole.  Its a MUST try!  I'm latin and love a good posole and Nat's version is pretty f****** amazing!  Oh yes, and last but not least, the passion fruit iced tea!  Love.  I'd give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for one thing.  They supposedly do not take rezzies.  Funny, every time I walk in I see \"reserved\" signs on several tables. Its quite annoying but I take a sip of the yummy iced tea and all is quickly forgiven. :)",

One of my friends described it as ,\"a diner with a good attitude\" and that fits it almost exactly.  It is urban-hip in decor, and a pretty small restaurant overall.  On a Sunday at 1p, expect a 20 minute wait.  I don't know if it was the acoustics, but it was pretty loud in there, so we chose to wait on the benches outside.  The servers were friendly and pleasant, and the coffee was strong and hot. I'd already scoped out the menu online, but alas, the menu at the restaurant was not exactly the same (no Shrimp Po Boy?! GASP!)   Luckily, I had a second choice in mind.  I ordered the Shrimp & Grits, and yep... My Yelp-ers were correct, those are some runny grits!! I generally don't like my grits so thin.  However, it comes with a lot of shrimp (no tails, either!), big slabs of bacon, and an egg (it comes poached, but they ask how you like it, so I ordered it cooked a little harder).    Because the grits were so thin, I stole my friend's delicious sourdough toast, which was soft and buttery, just the way I like it. The bread helped to sop up the grits, so maybe this meal should come with bread?  My friend enjoyed her corrnbeef hash, and loved that it tasted fresh and homemade. Our other dining companions got the grilled cheese and the huevo ranchero and both said they were delicious.   I'm glad to have a brunch option downtown, and eat. did the trick!",

The customer service was great and the thing that stood out like no other is their THICK CRISPY SOURDOUGH BREAD oh my god soooo good! I wasn't a huge fan of the fact that their menu says they \"politely decline\" any substitutions/ changes to their food especially because they have a limited menu. Probably not the best place for kids, picky eaters, or people with food limitations.",

    "text": "I need to start off by saying I LOVE the concept of eat and the fact that it is a thriving local business is down right impressive.   My family and I have eaten at eat twice now. Once for brunch and once for lunch. Ill start with our brunch experience: 3 out of 4 of us ordered chicken fried steak. I ordered shrimp and grits. I had their iced tea and it was delish served with an orange slice and mint. Now I LOOOOOVE tea so to be wowed by my usual beverage was awesome.  We shared beignets and they were FABULOUS. I see a lot of reviewers claim they're greasy/oily and that is far from the truth. They're topped with powdered sugar if they were greasy the sugar would be clumpy or at least look wet. They were delicious. The chicken fried steak was the best I had ever tasted and I regret not ordering it too. My shrimp and grits was tasty however the pico de gallo was overwhelmingly onion-y and I hate onions so maybe had I had no pico I would have enjoyed it more. Our service wasn't stellar however it didn't put us off either.   Now on to lunch. We decided to go and try out their sandwiches and have some still NOT OILY beignets. Our server greeted us and got our drink orders a dr. Pepper, apple juice, and 2 iced teas. He came back without a tea and a water instead. Little mix up no prob. Our tea wasn't garnished boo hoo \"( still nice flavor.... my daughter received a small glass of apple juice instead of the glass bottle it had come in on our previous visit. I wonder what happened to the rest of her Apple juice. I ordered our beignets and we waited and waited. Got our beignets and devoured them, stacked the plates, and waited. He came over apologizing and said the PC'S were down okay technical glitch I understand. We ordered the free range chicken sandwich, a reuben, a grilled cheese, and a DWblta. Our food didn't take too long and my chicken sandwich while not having a TON of flavor I could taste how fresh each component was. My mom and her wife loved the reuben and blta. My daughters grilled cheese was supposed to come with a tomato salad and chips and while they clearly put ALOT more chips then the rest of us the salad was missing. I would have said something had our waiter ever come back to check on us....my daughter didn't like the sandwich at all. The bread was way too big. Like an inch of bread with a thin layer of cheese then an inch of bread. We decrusted the sandwich then squished it down and she still barely ate more than 3 bites. She didnt even put a dent in tge chips either. When our waiter finally came back he offered us a box and I let him know about the sandwich his response was \"do you want me to take it off?\" I replied \"yes, as you can see she didnt eat any if it.\" He took her plate and left. He came back saying they would take half off. I'm not one to argue so I said thats ok. This 2nd trip put a big sour taste in our mouths in terms if service. I feel very let down because I was telling people to go try eat!!!",

The atmosphere is cozy and the decor is fun. We started with waters and their Colorado River Roasters fresh-brewed coffee. Crazy fact: I don't enjoy coffee. I don't hate it, but after I quit it cold turkey in 2007, I never went back. I've had a cup here and there, but can't find satisfaction in the bitterness or after-taste. This Colorado River Roasters coffee? SO good. I drank it black with just a sprinkle of raw sugar and it was delicious.  Plus, the coffee went deliciously with their housemade Beignets. Oh, these beignets were good. Lily and I are huge beignet fans and these did not disappoint. They were served with housemade jam and vanilla-scented mascarpone. YUM! For entrees, Lily and I shared the special of the day: BBQ Pulled Pork Hash (tender pork, good BBQ sauce, delicious breakfast potatoes, and beautifully poached eggs on toast) and Shrimp and Grits (perfectly cooked shrimp, creamy grits, thick bacon, fried over-easy eggs, and pico de gallo). My fiance had the Golden-Brown Pancakes served with chicken apple sausage and maple syrup. He was super happy with the pancakes and for good reason, they were some of the best pancakes I've had.   Everything was delicious, but those Shrimp and Grits were out of this world. It had a crazy amount of \"soup\" with it that seemed out of place (I've seen photos of that dish without the soup), but it still worked. Throwing the bacon and eggs in there was a very good call. I wasn't crazy about the hash dish, but I wouldn't complain about eating it again. Ether way, I can't wait to try some of their other menu selections. Oh, and our server was crazy nice and super awesome! Overall, wonderful experience!",

We were sat immediately, even though it was a busy morning. In my opinion, they had quite a surprising amount of people working for a Monday morning, which showed. The service was impeccable. Both glasses never went below half empty. The iced tea was phenomenal. We started with the special of the day, their deep fried deviled eggs. UNBELIEVABLE. At one point, I think every single table in the restaurant had one on the table. management: take note that your servers clearly push specials well, and know how to sell them. For brunch, boyfriend had the Reuben with chips, I had the two eggs breakfast with their special sausage, sourdough toast, and a pancake on the side. Everything was incredible. His sandwich was heavenly, served on thick bread, with the best housemate chips I've ever ever had. My breakfast was perfect, the chive potatoes living up to its reviews. My toast was served with a house strawberry jam that was so good it ended up all over my perfectly griddled pancake. All in all, it was a perfect perfect breakfast. Boyfriend and I wished we could have taken it all home, but it wouldn't have survived our day on the strip.   Thank you eat! We both vowed to come back any time we visit Vegas.   Trust me partiers, absolutely worth the 12 dollar can ride from the strip. ESPECIALLY if you're hungover.",

This place is more on the pricey side for breakfast/lunch food but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes it worth it.  Good sized portions, our family left the place more than satisfied. Definitely check out this place if you're in the area and looking for a good place for brunch/lunch.",

Usually it's quality over quantity but their portions were huge and their food was amazing. I had the truffle eggs, shrimp and grits and even the pancakes are a must try. My pancakes were fluffy and huge taste amazing. The prices are very fair for their hugeeeee portions. Must come back and try their earlier breakfast menu.",

    "text": "Great option for brunch/lunch in the downtown area!  I first learned about Eat after taking a Downtown Project tour.  After hearing Natalie's story, I was sold on having to check out her restaurant!  So our team (a group of 5) showed up around 1pm for lunch.  We weren't in the heat of the lunch rush, but there were no tables available, so we waited about 10 minutes for a table to open up for us.  Everything on their menu looked great, and I was debating between the Grilled Cheese/Tomato Soup and Chicken Pot Pie.  I ended going for the Chicken Pot Pie, which was amazing!  The crust was flaky, and the filling wasn't too liquidy.  The portion was great, and even came with a large side salad.  I finished most of the pot pie because it was so good, but I felt a bit guilty after (but I guess that's why it's comfort food, right?)  I probably should have eaten more of my salad to balance out my meal...oh well...  Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu!",

    "text": "The bf and I went in for our 'Valentine's Brunch' (the weekend following Valentine's Day) We waited no more than 3 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was filled with patrons but not in an overwhelming sense. We were seated at kind of an awkward table. It was a tiny table RIGHT next to a bar-like seating area. We sort of felt weird sitting in regular height chairs right next to people sitting on bar height chairs, but whatever. Definitely not enough to keep us away. I ordered a hot green tea (which was organic and didn't turn the water a lime green color, I hate that!) and the shrimp and grits. Boyfriend ordered their country fried steak and eggs with a side of pancakes to share.  Shrimp & Grits: SOoosososososoo delicious. I love the smooth texture of their grits  and the hints of crispiness from the bacon and pico de gallo. The shrimps (which they gave an abundant amount of) were cooked perfectly and the over-easy eggs they topped the whole thing off with gave the whole dish an extra creaminess that nobody can get mad over. They give you really big portion so I didn't end up eating the whole thing. Boyfriend didn't mind finishing it off at all :)  Country Fried Steak and Eggs (with seasoned potatoes): I had a bite of the steak and it was delicious. Not to much breading and the meat was tender. The gravy was perfect. Thick but not pudding-like. (gross)  Pancakes: The pancakes were sooooo fluffy and delicious. They had a yummy crispiness all around the edge and had a beignet-like texture and flavor to them. They soaked up the syrup like nobody's business so I suggest you do the 'pour and eat right away' method.   The service was OK. Our waiter checked on us to fill up our drinks (once) but then forgot that I wanted more hot water for my tea. It's conveniently located right beside the container park so I could see us having breakfast/brunch here again.",

We sat at the common table and were immediately greeted by the friendly staff.  Shortly after we sat down, a woman over-heard us talking about appetizers and immediately interrupted us to tell us we had to order the deviled-eggs.  Wow was she spot on.  The egg whites were deep-fried while the yokes were mixed with amazing-ness and put back onto the newly deep-fried egg whites.  We found out later that the woman who suggested it was the owner of the restaurant.  Turns out she knows what she's talking about.  After that I had the veggieburger which was by far the best I ever had.  I don't even know what else to say about it, just get it, or anything else on their menu.  I would definitely come back here.  It's also conveniently located next to container park which is always fun to walk through.  Bring your llama.",

Really wanted mushrooms but the chef well let's just say she wasn't on the greatest mood, said no. Ok whatever, ate my food so basically delicious! I snapped my food and my gf decides to last minute tell me she's on her way to join me, I tell the waitress ( green eye girl) to get me another plate, being the awesome waitress she is she puts my order in and BAM my gf says she stuck in construction traffic! I tell the waitress who then tells the chef who then rolls her eyes at her and throws the receipt. Oh my gosh! I feel horrible now! I just want to Apologize for my hectic day and having a co worker give you that dirty look because of me. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a chill vibe and some good breakfast or lunch. Just a tip to the staff; everyone is watching you too ! So careful with expressing so many facial features, remember it's not the waiters faults people can't get their life sometimes. Tip to me come here not so nervous and get the country fried steak next time! Lol",

The host staff was doing a great job. Got to see them deal with a very disgruntled lady and they handled it very well.  We got to sit over by the kitchen which was bustling and sending out plates super fast. The service was great, they got our drinks as soon as we sat down and our server Roberto was very attentive and the rest of the staff made sure we had everything we needed.  I'm a huge tea drinker and always judge the service by how well they keep up with me. My iced tea was never empty no matter how much i drank.   I had the chicken fried steak and got to sample a bit of my wife's pancakes. The potatos were just right with a nice layer of crispy goodness.  The steak was very good and the gravy had a little kick to it.  The toast is seriously 2 inches thick and I'm pretty sure they prepare it on a griddle. Only miss for me was the poached eggs, they were overcooked so didn't have the yolk to dip the toast in. The pancake I sampled was light and fluffy so I'm putting that on deck for my next visit.  Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to go back.  I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet.",

Yes we did have to wait, but that's only a testament to how great this place is. It's a slightly sketchy intersection to be sure, but... it's all just so lovely. I'm so into it. A pair of benches with the lyrics to \"Love Song\" etched on them just outside eat.'s windows immediately signaled to me that this was a special place indeed.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with a ginger beer, and the bestie got the huevos motulenos with soda. OMG. Portions were not overly large but everything came out perfectly and just off the line. My chicken fried steak could have used a bit more seasoning, but the smoked sausage gravy on top of it was divine. The bestie definitely preferred the green sauce over the red sauce on her eggs, but put together with the salsa, black beans and plantains, and everything together was ridiculously good.  To add to the awesomeness of it all... our overall bill + tip was much MUCH lower than we really expected for a brunch of such great caliber. Our server was kind and efficient, and everyone around us was just so happy and full like we were. Icing on the cake: the door out says \"ate.\" LOL cool.",

When a restaurant pays attention to perfect execution of a simple dish, that deserves recognition.  I've eaten several dishes here and most recently had the chilequile. I've never been disappointed with the food or the warmth of the staff. Kudos for bringing such a great little eatery to my downtown neighborhood.",

Parking: It is metered on the streets Pricing is reasonable  wait time: kinda lengthy but worth it Service: very personable and everyone is very helpful. The owner is there often and is seen assisting and greeting people. Thanks chef :)   now the food: the portions are sized well, I have tried the egg truffle sandwich and it is incredible. I like the hash. The menu is small and simple but the food is good no let me say great. I have enjoyed everything I have had here. The pancakes are hard to describe but just try them because it is delicious.   I try to go there once a month just because it is a place that is consistently amazing.   I will be back again and again as long as Chef is there, the food quality stays and the service is friendly.   This is how breakfast should be :)",

    "text": "The name says it all... this is where you come to EAT.  I am always looking for something new in Vegas and this place checks off all the boxes.  Innovative food, hip atmosphere, in an unexpected location.  We came for breakfast and we were not disappointed.  We came at opening so parking was not a problem and we were seated immediately.  I had my 1 year old grandson with and it was very comfortable for him too.  Our server suggested we get a starter... I have to be honest, I have never ordered a starter for breakfast.  He urgently suggested we try the fried deviled eggs.  So we complied and ordered them.  I will be dreaming of these eggs for a very long time.  They were delicious.  The whites are breaded and fried, and yet they were light and not at all oily.  Then the fried whites are piped with creamy, flavorful egg yolks, topped with bacon, sriracha and ketchup.  The combination of hot/cold/crunchy/creamy/spicy is FABULOUS.  All I know is this is a must have next time we go (and THERE will be a next time). <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=ovBp2Y8KJ3B-RAy3RqHMbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  For my main, I ordered the huevos motulenos.  I can't even begin to describe this dish.  The description on the menu didn't make much sense, I just trusted and jumped in.  It was superb.  My eggs were done perfectly, the flavors blended in a way that I never imagined.  I do not like peas, but the notation on the bottom of the menu told me that NO changes to the dishes will be made and after eating this dish I understand why.  Unless you have a life threatening allergy, trust in this chef and just order the dish that appeals to you.  She has put together flavors and textures that we would not normally think of, but they work perfectly.  This dish was a perfect example of this.  I especially loved the banana sauce on one of the eggs.  The chive potatoes were delicious as well. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=gpqlDvGzaN4aZvLybvpk8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  My daughter ordered the chicken fried steak and was not disappointed.  The breading to steak ration was very good and the gravy on top wonderful.  She ate the whole thing and it is not a small plate.  I never finished mine, but it was not for lack of trying to.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DAt-XT-3YHrndxuxn-9LZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  The one item that comes with the chicken fried steak is toast, you choose what kind.  She chose the sourdough and it turned out to be a star all on its own.  LARGE slices of fluffy, airy delicious bread.  We both decided it was something that would have to be ordered again, regardless of which meal we chose.  I would love to see this as French Toast (hint hint)  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xLwaGNgrMlV_a4DoltfTgA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-...</a>  The location is not what you expect from Vegas, although I see the eateries popping up in this neighborhood and I think we are seeing the beginning of a wonderful future.  The staff is friendly and helpful, they are also very playful, so come ready to have a fun time.  The ambiance is very new, different.  Very comfortable.  Loved the decor and they even have a patio area.",

By far makes the drive downtown worth it. Other highlights are the deep fried deviled eggs, tomato soup, and the local Mothership brewed coffee (could have skipped the grilled cheese.....unless your looking for 2 xxl pieces of Texas toast for lunch).   My only gripes about Eat is they have a selected breakfast menu that is only available until 11am (I am dying to try these chilaquiles) and I really wish they offered espresso based coffee drinks. But for those pancakes I will gladly spend 10 minutes rifling through 6th street looking for a parking spot.   Also, they have an awesome outdoor patio with picnic tables set up. Perfect for a private event",

I had the truffled egg sandwich and wifey got the hash.   Mine was good, but as other have mentioned, it was heavy on the truffle oil.   The potatoes and toast was good.   Wifey enjoyed her hash which is always a good thing.    Overall, it's a solid place.   I think it's a little over-hyped at the  moment.   I'd like to see if this place can find it's groove.

The corn beef is chopped into small squares along with potato bites and pieces of sourdough bread along with one egg. Maybe two eggs would of even out the plate in my opinion.

I had the strawberry salad and added avocados - strawberries were super sweet and avocado ripened just right, and super green that it blended with the salad. Pricey just a tad, but quality really shines through. Having a rare alone mommy time and I'm loving it:) I love brunch, cafes, and coffee. And I support my Vegas business owners in the grind just wanting to share good food culture with the community:) keep up the quality work!",

It was a busy day so we did wait a good 20-25 mins, besides, the restaurant is kind of small; however, the hostess was very attentive and kept letting us know he'd sit us in as soon as he had an opening.   The food ordering process and the food itself was great!   The service was the best I've had so far -- everyone was super attentive & even though they were busy, they managed to attend us all.   10/10 recommend this place.",

I wasn't sure if I was having too high expectations or.. it turns out an alright place to me with services, interiors and food.   I had ordere the chicken fried steak and the special of the day- burrito. The chicken fried steak was pretty good but it wasn't amazing delicious. The burrito was pretty disappointed with the flour wraps were dry and not fresh.   They provide different menus on weekends so maybe it's better.  I guess I would come back only if it's not crowded on weekends.",

We started out with the cinnamon biscuits with the strawberry compote.  I expected it to be sweet but it was just a tad sweet, so perfect.  Then I ordered the corned beef hash while my husband ordered the truffle egg sandwich, and my mother in law ordered the pancakes.  My favorite was the truffle egg sandwich.  It was just bursting with flavor!  Also, the chicken sausage was pretty darn good too.  I can't wait to return and try out other items.",

We put our names on the list and waited outside where there were some benches on the sidewalk. While waiting we looked through the menu.  When it was time for us to be seated, the helpful greeter inside called my name loud and clear both inside (I heard it, even though we were outside) and then they came outside too! Great service for this part.  We were seated quickly and someone came to take drink orders right away. Coffee here was average, but there were other options like lemonade and many teas in the selection.  The menu is pretty standard food for a brunch spot. I ordered the corned beef hash, but it came as meat cubes, not hash. The poached eggs were average and presentation here is clearly not important. While the food tasted OK, it was not outstanding or memorable. There's no reason to wait in line for this.  Service was prompt, but I was surprised that nobody offered water for our table. Just bring water - it's the most basic thing humans need after air. Bring it, or at least offer it.   Overall this place feels rushed and driven by turnover. It's clean and the food is OK. The servers are friendly, but they are moving fast and that is their main focus.",

Overall, this place def deserved the magazines spotlight, and the journey was validated.  The decor is that sort of new modernist industrial, lots of wood and metal, bare bulbs, etc. as I enjoy this ascetic, it worked for me. I was solo, so immediately got a stool at the counter, and within a minute had my coffee and water, and less than five minutes after placing my order, had my food. Fast, friendly service!  I'm docking one star because my only complaint was the food. I got the Chicken Fried Steak, which came with eggs, potatoes, and toast. The toast slices were thick and delicious. The potatoes were solid, so too the eggs. My only minor complaint was the CFS. Being from the south, I'm a bit of a perfectionist for this dish. The fried batter came out just a tad too soft; I prefer a crush. As this is a personal preference, I don't dock it too much, but that's what keeps this place slightly from getting ready a full 5 star from me.  That said, I saw some of the other dishes people next too me order, and I could imagine some of their more specialty dishes earning the full 5.",

I had the truffled egg sandwich which was omg good!  It is served with wild mushrooms, chives, feta cheese, and potatoes on ciabatta bread.  It was delicious.  It is like an elegant farm breakfast sandwich.    The vibe here is hipster-y without being super pretentious.  I felt like I was in LA but you are actually in downtown LV haha.  This restaurant is a random escape from the grunge of downtown.  I have to give dtown credit though.  There are a lot of cool spots that I need to explore further.  It is like an up and coming neighborhood.    I was impressed by my beignets and egg sandwich.  I need to come back and get blown away a little more by eat.",

However when we walked in today we were told I couldn't bring in my Starbucks which I had gotten at the casino before our walk over. I even asked if we order coffees would that then be okay?  We drink a lot of coffee so we would have. Instead we waited outside until most of it was gone. Nothing like chugging a coffee. Then we ordered 2 waters instead of coffee. It's not a great way to be greeted and no one likes to feel nickled and dimed. This isn't friendly or great customer service and effects the entire experience. .  However the staff was great. Management needs to rethink it or allow hostess to use discretion. We probably won't return just because of how it made us feel. Too many other great foodie places to go to because it is about the experience.",

Now that Du-par's isn't downtown anymore its hard to find another place that does that crispy golden pancake with a soft center. But not anymore. Eat does it even better. Plus the addition of the chicken sausage makes it feel like a more complete breakfast. As for the deviled eggs, frying them takes them to a whole new level. The service was great, the environment was chill, and the price is what you'd expect from quality cuisine. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Now, I'm no chef, but what they do here at eat is culinary excellence.  How they pack layers of flavor from the first bite to the last makes me want to quit cooking and just come here every morning.  Tip: Eggs Benedict is not on the menu but if you go on the weekend like I did they can make it special for you.",

Across from the new container park, eat. is a casual spot to grab some solid lunch and breakfast fare. I'm a sandwich first, ask questions later kind of guy, so I've yet to test out the breakfast, but everything I've had on the lunch side of things has been excellent. The free range chicken sandwich is served on a light, crunchy ciabatta with a juicy chicken breast and fresh toppings. The reuben is large and the best I've had in Vegas, the veggie burger is made on-site and the passion fruit iced tea is unsweetened, so it just has a hint of tropical flavor in it. Sold? I thought so. See ya there.    Pro Tip: Expect to wait for a few around noon",

My family and I ate here as out of town guest expecting a great experience after hearing wonderful reviews. However, it immediately went down hill when the manager did not accommodate a simple request.. to have my party and I be seated together. We were a party of 8. He initially sat us in separate tables that were no where near each other. Hello?.. we came here to eat together. When a larger table (2 standard tables that was push together) opened up, we kindly asked the manager if it will be okay to sit there instead. He agreed and as he walked away, he whispered \"what's the point?\". How rude is that? We were expecting for our whole party to sit at the larger table we requested  but instead the manager pulled the tables apart. Uhhh..We wanted the tables to be pushed together so my party and I could eat at the same table! When we asked a staff if we could push the tables together, the manager overheard and yelled \"NO!\" How unprofessional is that? So rude. Luckily the staff here are attentive and polite. They kept apologizing to us for their manager's unprofessional behavior. But they seriously need to fire Michael for being such an asshole to his guests!",

The only thing that didn't meet up to my expectations when I came here for the first time was the menu. The menu is about three pages long with the last page being just of sides and drink selections. But I shouldn't have expected much since the place is smaller than average.   I really love ordering the golden-brown pancakes, one egg, and bacon all from the sides menu. The golden-brown pancakes are PHENOMENAL!! The best pancakes I have ever had!! They are so filling and so delicious. What I ordered is seriously a great combination and I wish it was a combo that I could order from the menu. The killer grilled cheese ordered with tomato soup is fantastic. I've never liked tomato soup until I came to eat. The grilled cheese is delicious on its own as well and I think about it occasionally... LOL   I'll definitely be coming back to eat. time and time again.",

My last visit at eat. there were extra tons of people with cameras and video recorders.  Looked like they were setting up to film a show inside because even a dude was getting his make up Did.    $4 orange juice.  But anyway the last two visits were on weekdays, I really need to go on a weekend because the menu is different.  But so far I've had the Mediterranean Egg White Frittata Spinach which came with tomatoes, Kalamata olives, feta and basil with whole wheat English muffin.  That was good, so healthy.  When I saw the English muffin I tried to sneak in and ask if they can make me an eggs benedict, but nope.  Then for my latest visit I had the Smoked Salmon Cream cheese, capers, sliced tomatoes, red onion and rye bread.  It was laid out neatly but I made a mess of it, it's a normal dish that can be found on your weekend brunch but I was honestly craving for their weekend brunch items.    It just means I need to go back, park somewhere free, sit down, eat while taking my time rather than rushing.  And don't be fooled by the appearance of the neighborhood, when you go in you are in a completely different environment.  You wouldn't think a restaurant like this is located in downtown Las Vegas.",

Coming from Reno, we're not huge on casino food, and I was intrigued by this restaurant, trying to contribute to the re-development of the downtown area.  We had the beignets (delicious pillows of light, fluffy flavor, with just the right amount of sweet), and I ended up getting the huevos motulenos (an interesting mix of peas, feta, egg, black beans, salsa etc on corn tortillas), while the GF got a grilled cheese. The GF liked it - inch-thick pieces of sourdough, with generous amounts of cheese, and there was definitely that nice blend of buttery, grilled toast, contrasted by the almost gooey cheese.  Definitely worth checking out if you're staying in downtown Vegas.",

We were in on a Saturday morning (maybe around 10?) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table for 2 which for brunch rush hour is nothing. The space is cute, hip and modern but warm, and the food was solid. I had a truffled egg sandwich absolutely loaded with mushrooms and a side of stellar potatoes. They were perfectly crunchy, and well seasoned - basically my ideal breakfast potato. My partner in crime had the shrimp and grits and liked them. Like a fool, I forgot to steal a taste so I can't comment on them beyond that. I also loved that it was off of the strip and in a much calmer, less crazy part of town. The menu is relatively limited, I think there was one short-ish page of options when we were there, but still enough to find something you want. Though I wouldn't have objected to maybe one more vegetarian option on the menu. Still would definitely recommend, especially if you're visiting Vegas and looking for something a little more chill and less wildly overpriced.",

    "text": "A hidden gem just outside of Las Vegas - on the floor level of all things - a motel!  A little seedy from the outside, but that all dissipated when you walk through the door into a modern, chic diner.   They don't take reservations, but come early to avoid the wait.  We got there just before eleven on a Saturday and were able to be seated right away.  There was a bit of a wait (in 100+ heat!) by the time we left.  On to the food - in order of yumminess, BOLDs are HIGHLY recommended:  GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH on ciabatta - This was the highlight of the meal.  Stuffed with tomato and arugula, - warm, tasty, and fresh.  I would definitely recommend this.  BIEGNETS - SO yummy!!!  Probably best to share, since they really are just donuts, but so soft and warm, and perfect with the jam and cream.  SHRIMP AND GRITS - This was really good.  I can't even explain it - it really just looks like a bowl of runny grits with shrimp, but the flavor was superb.   Huevos montunlenos - I know these are a big hit on Yelp, but maybe I'm just not a Mexican breakfast type of person.  I recognize that these had a good, spicy flavor with the salsa and tortillas cooked in, but just not my cup of tea.  Now, if you LOVE your Mexican breakfast, go for it!  Tomato soup - I agree with the other reviews - really salty.  We initially had wanted the tomato salad, but were told they were out and only had the soup, which we settled for.  Oh well.  All in all, a great meal.  My dad still talks about it weeks later.  Street parking was not too difficult.  And it's just down the street from where they shoot Pawn Stars, so you can spend a little time walking off your food perusing there!  :)   (did I just embarrass myself by admitting we watch that show so much that we recognized the shop driving by?)",

Everything coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing and I couldn't wait! They serve coffee from a local roastery. It was fabulous and helped hold us over until our meals came. We tried the pancakes with chicken apple sausage. The sausage was so flavorful and the pancakes were the perfect texture.  We also ordered the deviled eggs which were flavorful and a little spicy. Delicious! We were very happy with the food, the service, and the atmosphere.   The bill came to $40 which is the only thing keeping me from leaving a five star review. I think it is a little on the high side considering we had pancakes, two sausages, two eggs, and coffee between us.",

But, we were in early enough (around 9:15am) that we were seated immediately at the community table. By the time we left, there was a decent amount of people waiting outside. So, as for the food, it was good, but neither of us was particularly impressed. I ordered the pancakes, my husband ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The pancakes were golden brown and fluffy, and served with two small containers of maple syrup and butter on the side. Perhaps because I recently had a great experience with plain buttermilk pancakes at another restaurant, these pancakes, while good, were nothing special. If there was no wait, I'd probably come back. But I don't think it lived up to the hype, and I wouldn't be willing to put up with a long wait to eat here.",

While I thought the filling could use a little more salt, the pie overall was outstanding. That lead to a few more visits and a lot less time in my own kitchen.

The hostess who sat us, barely made eye contact and showed us where to sit by waving in the direction of an empty table.  Our waiter, Robert, seemed rushed and wasn't friendly or pleasant.    I ordered the chicken friend steak and asked for the gravy on the side, but when it arrived, my food was covered in gravy.  Before I could ask for a change, the server who brought the food already rushed off.  I relented and ate my food as it came, but was pleasantly surprised.  I normally don't like too much gravy on my food, but the gravy was delicious.  My party also ordered the beignets for the table.  The other reviews on beignets were mixed, so we wanted to try them out for ourselves.  As most reviewers noted, the beignets were dense and not flaky and light like they're suppose to be.  That being said, they still tasted pretty good.  I intend to come back because although it was just an average visit, I see the potential of this place turning into a great local spot.  I think that the staff have to be more friendly and attentive, but otherwise, this is a place that I would still recommend.",

The breakfast potatoes were tasty with onions and light seasoning. Coffee was strong and flavorful. Our only regret was our stomaches weren't bigger! We will be back for a meal next time we're in town.",

We were a group of 10 and she tried to sit us on a table for 8 and when we asked the server if they can add the empty 2 person table to our table the server said let me ask the manager. She then came back & said ok but the manager immediately came to our table and said no no wait I cannot give you the table unless we don't have a waiting list. There was at least 3 empty tables.  I have never been in a restaurant that the manager was so rude with no customer service. However the severs were great & food was excellent despite the managers rude service.",

I had the Ruben sandwich and it was perfect. I had to say that the bread were delicious. The only thing that was slightly upsetting was the amount of time to plaxe our orders, they sat us down but took almost 10 minutes to ask us what to drink, let alone say hello. On the other hand, after ordering, it took less than 5 minutes for the food to come out, and it was very large portions.The atmosphere was excellent and clean place.",

The egg whites  are fried perfection and the filling is topped with a bacon and tomato chutney essence. I am a fan of Cracker Barrel style pancakes and this is the first place in Vegas that I have had the  fried edged griddle style cakes! They were awesome. There was a 30 min wait but container park is directly across the street and made the time go by. You must check this out for a brunch option.",
