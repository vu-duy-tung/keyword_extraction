Food quality was mediocre,  vegetables in food seemed to be odd ; peas and carrots were the vegetables in the chicken for lettuce wraps.  They strongly resembeld the frozen kind that you can get at the grocery store.  The other Thai restaurants that I have been to have much better food and have much better pricing than Pin Kaow.",

We had the crispy crab rolls which were good nothing amazing, pad prik king which was pretty tasty and pad kee maw (spicy chili mint noodles) which was pretty tasty as well.   If you like spicy get 7+ because we had 6 and it was pretty mild.  All in all a great Thai restaurant in vegas.",

I recommend asking what's in a dish before ordering, because with Thai food you always run the risk of getting some sort of fish sauce in it (totally understandable). Any of the vegetarian options can be made vegan if you ask to omit the egg. I always get the tofu pad thai with fried tofu and no egg. So good! And with my dairy-consuming friends, they always obsess over the Thai iced tea.",

The good taste great every time I've been there. \"5\" is medium but it's still pretty spicy so be careful. The service is awesome. This is a must go if you love good Thai food. Price is a little high compared to other Thai places. If they had bigger portions than they would be the best in town. Definitely will go back.",

I ate the Red Curry at a number 10 with Shrimp and we also ordered Chicken Satay and Red Curry with Chicken at a three. The food was excellent. I did think the 10 wasn't very hot. It was hotter then the three which seemed very mild to me. This may just be my tolerance for spicy or hot food though but other places I've eaten at seemed much hotter, even at a 7.   The portions were decent and the price came to about $50 bucks with desert and three drinks. The price seemed reasonable. I was satisfied with both the service and the value.   The one complaint I have is very minor but I thought the amount of rice served with the meal wasn't enough. Still I'd recommend you stop in.",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place! The Beef Fried Rice, is the best in the city. I hear the Pineapple Fried Rice is awesome as well. We also love their Mongolian Beef, and Lemon Chicken. We are wimps with spice, so we get our dishes at a level 4. Thinking of bringing it up a notch though. The only downside to the majority of their dishes is portion to price ratio. It's great for one person, but not good for a family. All they offer is individual plates. You can split the rice between two people though.  If this place offered Family Meals, they would have a 5 star from me! I will admit, that the Lemon Chicken, does come with a good amount of chicken, meaning you can split it between at least three people.  Last but not least, is their Mango Sticky Rice. OMG! just enough sweetness, hits the spot. You can taste both the coconut and mango at the same time. One order is good enough to split among two. My wife and I love it so much, that we order one to take home and eat later or the next day as well. The last time we ordered it ( March) it was not in season. :/ so make sure to ask if it is season before getting your taste buds ready for it! haha.",

The outside of the restaurant and its location could lead one to believe that it was going to be disappointing inside (to be honest I only went because of the yelp reviews) and then I walked in and BAM! I was blown away.  It was so nicely decorated, it had a very rich/authentic feel to the place.  The staff was over the top friendly, the food was simply divine, and the Bellini (champagne and pureed berry) was off the chain!    My friend and I had pot stickers and spring rolls for apptz - delicious and hot- quickly came out as well.  Main course for lunch for me was the Shrimp Chili Mint Noodles, it had so many good reviews, YUM YUM YUM. I had it on heat 8 (I have a spicy palate, but next time I'm going to 10, it was spicy but I wanted more) .  My friend had the Pad Thai and the only thing I can say about that is, I have never liked Pad Thai, I thought it was gross and hated that peanut flavor to it, this Pad Thai was so freaking good, I'm pretty sure I'm getting this next time, seriously!   If you are around this place, craving a little ethnic food in your life, and Thai sounds good, don't pass this place, you'll be crying like a baby caused you missed it!",

Sticky rice, beef jerky and somtam will take you straight to a new level of awareness. Haven't tried the other branches, but the Rainbow/Lake Mead is a culinary retreat. Great service every time.",

    "text": "I've visited this establishment twice. The first time the staff was very rude when inquired as to the mushrooms in my meal. I had ordered a meal without mushrooms (I dislike them as much as kids dislike veggies). I asked my question with courtesy and kindness and was met with rudeness.  The manager came to my table and pushed the menu up in my face and pointed with emphasis that what I ordered indeed had mushrooms-she was angry that I asked. Then when I asked for a sauce to cover up the mushrooms to lessen the taste, she refused.  * About six months later I gave them a second chance because my girlfriend likes a certain dish they make. This time around I made certain to carefully read what the dish I was ordering contained. The meal came and the chicken tasted like it had freezer burn and was very poor quality and near expiration. I left the meal there and didn't eat it at all, waiting for my girlfriend to finish the dish she enjoys. They didn't ask why I wasn't eating it and as usual seemed troubled to even smile or thank us for visiting. If you wonder why I didn't complain, well, I didn't want to be publicly yelled at again by management. I won't return.",

The staff members are very friendly and attentive, and the food is excellent. We both had appetizers (crab rangoon and chicken satay), tom ka soup, and I had pad see ew and my friend had the Pin Kaow version of drunken noodles (I don't remember what they called it). The food was presented beautifully and tasted excellent. Probably the best Thai I've had, and definitely recommended. If you want great food in Vegas, get away from the Strip!",

In fact one dish I can't recall but it had some kind of ground meat in it...(which the menu didn't mention) was downright disgusting. Other dishes like duck curry are a delight. It's not the best thai beef salad I've ever had, but all of the curry dishes and most of the other thai standards are terrific. I love the whole fish and the papaya salad! Beware of spice levels in the salad. Even a 2 is mouth-scorching. While I order the curries and other dishes at 5 or even 6, I stick to 1 on the salads. Take this seriously or you will be on fire!",

Yep, I'll drive on over from a conference hotel on the Strip to get my food fix here! Great Thai food and generous portions! I usually order the Cashew Nut Chicken - YUMMY - and my wife typically feasts on a chicken-egg plant dish. I couple my meal with a huge glass of Thai Iced Tea - I wish other Thai restaurants would follow suit and not skimp on the beverages. Absolutely every time I've dined here, the place was crowded, so come by a little before lunch time or dinner time to try to avoid standing in line. What a hidden gem of a restaurant!",

Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a \"Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?\" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money. I havent been back in over a year because I refuse to pay $10-15 for dinner and still be hungry after. Sorry PinKaow, you are not what you used to be!!",

    "text": "I ordered carryout from this location last night.  I was craving pad thai and could not find the boxed kind you make yourself at Fresh and Easy since they are remodeling.  The reviews here made me decide to try this place.  This was my first experience with Thai food in Las Vegas.  The service was great- very nice girls answering the phone, fulfilling orders (mine was exact,) and greeting you at the door.  My order was ready exactly at the time promised.  I ordered a Thai iced coffee which was great, shrimp roll appetizer and a medium-spicy Pad Thai with shrimp.  My total was $28 without gratuity I included.  The shrimp rolls were very good and I thought I got a very good portion with the price I paid.  I wished the orange sauce was not so watery though because every time I dipped the shrimps in the sauce the sauce did not stick.  My pad thai was okay.  It seemed like the shrimp had been overcooked and like the pad thai had been sitting for a long time.  The noodles were thinner then what I am used too; the noodles taste the same but I still enjoy them thicker.  This pad thai killed my craving but it wasn't that good of pad thai to be honest.  I probably won't order from here again but the service was really good!  I'm sure there are more uniquely Thai dishes I could have ordered from here that maybe would be better but I'm really only into pad thai.",

I ordered the beef pad thai and chicken larb and was greatly disappointed by both. The larb lacked the flavorful kick that I love and the pad thai wasn't nearly as sweet as I remembered. Overall, my meal was very bland and disappointing to say the least.",

    "text": "Most recent, was just at Pin Kaow this afternoon, a delivery a few weeks ago. and perhaps about a month ago Prior to that, it had to have been at least 7-8 years since. Today's options were a lychee Thai tea, Thai beef salad, chicken panang curry, and crab fried rice. That lychee thai tea was something else, it combines the clean taste of lychee with Thai flavors from the tea. Steer away if you aren't into sweets cause hubby was so-so about it. That Thai beef salad is fiiiire. Extra lit. I got a spice level 3/10 and the veggies were fresh, the beef wasn't over done and tough (a pretty common issue), and the dressing was the total definition of that Thai balance of sweet, salty, spicy. My family and I live for that. Chicken panang curry was a bleh. It was cool, the depth of coconut richness was highly lacking. The 4/10 spice level was great. Soo that's what I'm knocking down for. The crab salad was a re-order and did not disappoint. Really, y'all gotta try it! I felt like they could have been a little more attentive to needs, such as needing more napkins or just checking in. But ehh, it was around 11:30am and I get the whole lunch rush thing.",

We were immediately seated and was ask for appetizer and drinks.. The service was very fast... We took a glance and decided on food.. Papaya salad was ordered and so was Pad Thai... As a person who often look for good Thai i asked for the waitress recommendation-- Pad See ew Chicken... Which is chinese style fat rice noodle(chow fun style) with chicken, and thai spicing.. Very good and strong flavoring... Really loved it, their papaya salad is different from what im used to due to the fact the pepper were all green and wasnt mixed well into the salad... Overall id you're looking for a quick Thai fix... This is the place to be :D",

We have ordered a couple times from here in the past, and this was not what we remembered.... or perhaps we have just been to enough other top-notch Thai restaurants since then?    We ordered the Crying Tiger beef, catfish green curry, and chicken pad thai.    The crying tiger beef was ok -- it was basically a steak with a little heap of salad and a big wedge of cabbage.   The sauce was good, but we would have preferred if the steak were marinated in it more.    Catfish Green Curry was pretty good, but a little salty.   Otherwise we would go back for that dish!  the Pad Thai was well, pitiful.   Cooked well, but hardly any flavor - not what one would expect from pad thai.     Added some of our own lime juice (it did not come with any lime) which made it more palatable.   Needed more sauce and it would have been good.   Overall, not a bad meal, but we probably won't be back -- Especially not for their prices!",

I tried to explain it but they didn't understand that it's not the same & claim it is the same as always. They were kind enough to not charge me, it's just I'm going to miss my favorite item on the menu.

I had been there a few times but not recently. We had potstickers and chicken puffs for appetizers and Thai fried rice and pad see ew for entrees.  I'll start by saying the ambience of the restaurant is fantastic. Traditional attire for the staff, very knowledgeable about the cuisine and very attentive. If this was a review of just the staff, nothing but 5 stars however this isn't just about the service... My wife and I enjoy spicy food but we hadn't eaten at Pin Kaow for a while so we decided to order our food at a 6 out of 10. Honestly, after trying both dishes, I thought they brought us a zero out of 10! I was extremely disappointed; so disappointed that I didn't try to \"spice it up\" with the available condiments.  The moral of this eating story for us is to wait until our favorite spot reopens but until then, no Thai for us!",

The so called curry was basically a serving dish of colored water with chicken and vegetables. I did not taste any spice at all, despite the fact that I ordered it Spicy 8 out of 10. It was so bland that I could only eat a few bites. I was tempted to get up and walk out without paying it was so bad. Staff couldn't care less that a customer immediately asked for a check after taking a few bites.",

I got the red curry, with tofu. Super bland, no spice to it, even when I asked for their highest level of spicy.(they rate form 1-5) I don't know why they feel the need to \"American\"-ize it and make it gross. People go to Thai places for Thai food. If I wanted bland ass American food I'd go somewhere else. I even added in chilli (which took forever to request and get) and it didn't help. A friend I was with got the Pad Thai, which was just as horrible. It was way too sour and also lacked any spice.  the service was slow and rude, and in an almost completely empty restaurant, they felt the need to sit a family with three infant and toddler children next to us. How. Pleasant. We left quickly after that, and were glad to. Pretty bland place with bland food, won't be returning",

We usually can't go wrong with thai food because most thai places are decent in general. However, there are some that stood out and others that missed the mark. Unfortunately, pin kaow didn't impress us with the food. Service was excellent! 2 stars for that...  When we walked in, we saw a lot of non asian diners, so we got a little weary because based on our experience with Thai places lacking asian diners means the food doesnt taste as authentic... But we were hungry and decided to chance it,,, well, besides the Thai ice tea, everything we ordered were pretty bland..  The curry was bland, tasted watery... Papaya salad tasted like they just shredded the papaya and tossed a few times around the sauce...pad Thai was bland as well.. We didn't finished eating because of the lack of flavor.. I guess you can say, being southeast asian, we're used to a more savory, rich in spices flavors and pretty particular. But we understand the lack of spices can be due to pin kaow catering to mostly non Asian diners, sorry to be so blunt.. However, adding more spices doesn't mean the food should be spicy, just more rich coconut milk in the curry, fish sauces, lime leaves and lemongrass, which are essential in southeast Asian cuisines,,   Service was great! But the food missed the mark for us...",

    "text": "Awful NEW manager named \"MON\" who treated our family (longtime customers for over 10 years) so incredibly rudely!  We were less than 10 minutes late due to holiday traffic and she gave away our reservation. No problem, our bad. We decided to wait since it was our fault for being late. As tables opened up she gave tables to other customers with NO reservations. She finally pointed out a table for us instead of the booth we requested, so we said that's fine. Then, she CHANGED her mind and gave us a table located near the door where cold wind was blowing through.  Wow. Don't ever be a few minutes late here if you have a reservation. Sad to say after so many years of being loyal customers this new manager named MON will give us pause as to whether we should ever return. Terrible manager!!!",

Don't be distracted by the neon lights and come here instead! We ordered the shrimp egg rolls which were really good but not traditional. The were basically just shrimp in egg roll paper and deep fried with a delicious dipping sauce. For entrees we ordered the duck curry and their special \"Gulf of Thailand\". The duck curry was amazing. The actual curry broth was the best we both had ever had and we were just covering our rice in it at the end so we wouldn't waste any. The special was very good and had tons of different seafood. The star of the dish was the scallops so I would definitely order any thing that has scallops. We also ordered the Thai ice tea which wasn't great but pretty standard. We would definitely come back again!",

My girlfriend and I stopped by Pin Kaow for lunch where we both had the pumpkin Thai curry (my absolute all time favorite dish from here). I got my usual shrimp curry and my friend got chicken curry. We noticed as we were eating the squash was undercooked and there were hardened pieces we had to pick out. The dish was also served warm and not hot. We ate around 1230 and left around 1pm. I live about 6 minutes from the restaurant and my stomach was intensely cramping the whole way home. I literally had to run to the bathroom when I got in. Then the nausea started and the vomiting and you can guess how horribly the rest of my night went. My friend was fine, so I think I had bad shrimp since that's the only difference between our two dishes. I will NEVER be back. Gross. Just gross.",

The location felt kind of random, there's not much around it.   Atmosphere: The lighting was pretty dim, which was fine. We were confused at first because it was empty and dark, we thought it was closed. A waitress popped out from the back and seated us.   Food: I'm not that into pad thai, but once in awhile I'll get a craving. I decided to give it a try and satisfy my craving. It was okay, not \"omg I need to have it again,\" but I probably won't need to have it again for awhile. They ask the scale of spiciness you want 1-10. I decided to get a 6 so there would be a little bit of kick, but not too much. I didn't really notice the spice when I ate it.   My friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggplant plate if you're in the mood for something different!  I think I'll come here again and try the curry.   Service: The waitress was kind of attentive. It took us awhile to get our bill. We were just sitting and talking, waiting for the bill to come. But at least she gave us a refill on our water a couple of times!",

However, I've been meaning to come and seized the opportunity when it was my choice of food for family dinner.   While it is in a typical shopping center, the inside is much nicer than any other Thai places around with it's wood carved panel decor. It's the type of Thai place you could take a casual date. This time I picked up my order to-go, but I will definitely sit in next time.   We had -   Massuman curry with tofu - this to me reminded me for of a panang, but still very good. Actually grandma really, really liked this one and asked to order it in the future.   Mongolian beef - It was decent, just not my style of mongolian beef. This is that Thai Chinese style brown sauce kind that I'm eh about, but it was properly cooked and seasoned.   Chili Mint Noodles - These are wide noodles in a soy, chili flavoring with basil leaves. I rather liked this, real flavorful and spicy. If you like wide noodles and something like pad se ew but dont feel like sweet, then go with these.  Mango sticky rice - their version I had at another location and quite like it. Also the portion is generous with two squares of rice when most places give you one. The rice was cooked right, the coconut cream was seasoned, half mango was ripe.  I can't comment really on service since my first experience was to-go, but the people were always polite and courteous on the phone and in person. Better than average ordeal of getting stuff ordered right.   Will be back for a dine in soon.",

My last two visits to the restaurant made me wonder if it was even the same place.  Last month, the service was appalling.  My friend and I both ordered duck pad tai.  The duck was reminiscent of boiled liver.  Neither one of us could even eat it.  The entire meal, from when we sat down to when we walked out the door took well over ninety minutes.  Today we ordered take out.  Half way through the meal, I discovered this hair in my pad Thai. When I called the restaurant and asked for assistance from a manager, they insisted the only way that they could rectify the situation was if I returned immediately.  I would highly recommend forgetting about Pin Kaow.  The great restaurant that was is no more.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch yesterday for the first time in ages, and I'm not sure why we stopped coming here over the years. The food was as good as I remembered it to be, and I think it's the best, authentic Thai food I've had so far in Vegas (I have yet to try Lotus of Siam).   The restaurant is kind of dim due to their dark wooden walls, but they do use a lot of bright lighting to compensate. We ordered the ginger dish with scallops (spicy level 6), chicken with spicy basil (spicy level 3), and pad Thai (spicy level 3) lunch specials. The lunch specials include soup and your choice of salad or an egg roll plus a fried wonton. All the dishes were really good, and the portions were bigger than I expected. I wish we upped the spicy levels on the dishes however, as even the 6 wasn't that spicy.   Food came out really slow. It took over 15 minutes to get our soup, and another 20 minutes to get our entrees. Server never informed us that the food would take awhile, and it wasn't even that busy. I don't mind if the food takes awhile as long as we're informed (kitchen is slammed or the restaurant is short-staffed) so minus a star for being left hanging.   Because the food is really good and the prices/portions are reasonable, I'll be back if I'm ever in the mood for Thai food.",

Kind of in the mood for some Thai- so I thought what the heck?!  I parked in the parking lot and headed in. They have quiet a bit of neon in the windows, blacked out by the way, and somehow got the impression this was  going to be kind of dumpy. BOY WAS I WRONG!!   I walked in to get an order to go and was immediately greeted with 2 lovely women with smiles on their face saying \"welcome\". The place was absolutely beautiful incredibly clean, and beautifully put together!... This would definitely be someplace that I would go on date night! Really nicely put together. I told them I wanted to take an order to go, and was directed to the back bar ( I LOVE THIS, because who want to have date night with to go orders staring you in the face the whole night... awesome idea to do it that way). I got to the back bar and the Woman taking my order was awesome! I wanted to get the pad Thai minus egg and some spring rolls. All vegan by the way... They have a ton of vegan options on the menu. Anyway, she was super happy to replace the egg with tofu and no extra cost! She even asked if I wanted the fish sauce... Just in case on the side!!! How awesome is that. Anyway she rang me up and Then asked me if I wanted a glass of water with lemon as I waited. It was only gonna take about 10 minute she said. That was super impressive, I mean how many times have you gone to a restaurant and they offer you a glass of water while you're waiting for your to go food?... I'll answer that, NEVER!   OK so then while I was waiting I popped into the ladies room. It was absolutely immaculate even the trashcan was wiped down! Not to mention there was about a dozen fresh roses next to the sink ( photo included ) .    Came back to wait for my order, I was immediately greeted with a glass of water with ice and lemon... And about two minutes later with my order. Total waiting time from order to delivery was about five minutes!    I had it finish my glass of water yet so the woman delivering my food offered it to put it in a to go cup! I mean how nice is that. I didn't need to need the to go cup and just drink it there.   When I left about two or three people said thank you so much for coming, thank you so much, thank you... And actually looked me in the face when They said it.   From the time I walked in the time that I left I felt that I was appreciated I felt like I was noticed I felt like they really really wanted me to come back again and again because of this absolutely wonderful service!  Great job Pin Kaow on Rainbow! I will be back again and again!",

After ten impatient minutes of being on hold multiple times, I ordered Pad Thai and Rad Na. They said it'll take an hour. AN HOUR. Ridiculous waiting time.  My food finally arrived within the expected delivery time. Pad Thai is my absolute favorite Thai dish, and you can never go wrong with it, but they managed to do so. It was completely dry and lacked flavor. They didnt even throw in a complimentary lime for my noodles (i love lime). My starving self couldn't even finish a third of my entree before I threw it out. My boyfriend had the Rad Na, his favorite, which wasn't necessarily great either. Rad Na is listed under the noodles section of the menu, which its supposed to be a noodle dish made with vegetables and gravy. But what we got was a dish of gravy with very, very little noodle. I mean, we didn't order a soup dish, so I'd expect a lot more noodles for my noodle entree.  Those two displeasing dishes were not worth over 20 dollars, and it was definitely not worth 2 stars, but if I hadn't had a better previous dining experience here, it would've been just one star.   Once again, don't do delivery!!",

She suggested Thai food, but her favorite spot was too far in the other direction. We turned to Yelp and found Pin Kaow conveniently located just off the 95. Based soley on appearance from the outside, I was expecting to stand in line, order at the counter, take a number and wait. Boy was I wrong. This is a full blown, sit down and be waited on restaurant. We were seated immediately and the service was great. The Crab Rangoon appetizer was the best I've had and the sweet and sour pork was like none I had never seen. It was not breaded, rather pieces of tender pork in a spicy sweet and sour sauce, complimented with peppers, onions and carrots. I sampled the Mrs.' Panang and thought it was great. I have nothing to compare it to, as this was my first experience with Panang. The berry sangria was a nice addition to the meal. The wood decor gave a nice elegant feeling in somewhat of a casual atmosphere. A solid four star experience without breaking the bank. A great place for a date night dinner, or a casual meal with friends.",

The beef chow mein was alright - nothing to rave about. My friends ordered the chicken pad thai and a glass noodle dish + rice. The servings were pretty decently sized.

Their lunch specials were great, something everyone could enjoy and great prices. There were no pictures of the entrees so I was a little worried but when my food arrived it was lovely, delicious pad Thai awesomeness. Everyone at our table cleaned their plates (except for me because, you know, I'm a dainty flower and large portions for me means doggie bag left overs for the boyfriend.) Their Thai tea was perfect, it made me smile and I had to use some self control instead of just chugging the whole glass. The food was authentic and fresh and  delicious and their prices make it even better. Now I know where to go when my Thai food cravings hit again. And the name of the place is fun to say...",

I got the shrimp & asparagus dish and it was awesome. My picky son even ate a lot of his meal. My brother had a coconut curry soup that was pretty tasty too. My sister in law loves this place for good reason. My husband who holds a high standard about food loved his garlic and chicken dish even though it wasn't as spicy as he wanted.  I would come back if given the opportunity and recommend it to others with a note about their spice scale being tamed.",

Offered tea or hot water since they heard that I was congested.  The place was packed (8pm on a Friday night), but I still felt like everyone was attentive.  Not just to our table, but to everyone else.  The courses were brought out in good time frames as we never had a time where we were waiting.  We had Pad See Ew, Crab Rangoons, and Tom Yung Kung soup. We enjoyed each dish.  Would definitely come back.  :-)",

    "text": "Solid Red Curry w/Tofu, got it at a 7 spice level (out of 10) and it was spicy enough without being overpowering. The Red Curry itself was on the thicker side and of medium sweetness. A little cheap on the Tofu and heavy on the Bamboo Shoots, though. Got it as part of the lunch special (7.95) which came with a spring roll, crab rangoon and a free cup of soup. The soup was a broken rice chicken soup - unfortunately it was very salty, and the spring roll was fresh but standard issue - nothing special.   Enjoyed the Red Curry, but was most taken aback by the surprise +$3 charge for each Brown Rice substitution. Our bill showed up with two lunch specials and a +$6 charge for two Brown Rice substitutions. The Manager offered to remove one of the rice charges, which was reasonable, considering the waitress did not mention that there would be an upcharge. I do consider +$3 for a Brown Rice substitution a deal-breaker when it comes to lunch specials, especially when there are many similar Thai options at around $7-8, all-in.   Dinner prices are $10-13 for the curries, and based on our experience today, expect to pay at least $3 for Brown Rice. If you happen to ask for a little more rice, I bet they ring you up for another $3 cup.  I would like to try their Massaman curry, as our waitress said it is her favorite.  The atmosphere IS impressive, warmly decorated and built entirely of wood: wood paneling, wood floors, and wood trim. The goldfish aquarium along the back wall is spotless, and the bathrooms are clean. They certainly take pride in their shop. I can see taking a client here or someone going on a date here, occasions when nickel-and-diming don't matter.   Weera Thai is still my top-slot Thai place for value, taste, and service. Mad at myself for not taking advantage of double-punch-Mondays at Which Wich today instead (1 block north of Pin Kaow.)",

(I usually go to Pin Kaow 2 which is closer to my house SEE THAT REVIEW FOR MORE)  The atmosphere here is very pleasant, dim lighting and authentic decor down to the servers. The service here is amazing, the servers are sweet and very attentive. So back to lunch, 7.95 for your choice of either pork, beef, chicken, or tofu or 8.95 for shrimp or squid. I love their lunch specials because for 7.95 (dine in) you get to choose from the top 10 most ordered dishes that come with a side of rice, daily soup, egg rolls, & fried wontons. ALL THAT for $7.95 what a great deal! I absolutely love Pin kaows chain of restaurants. They have 3 locations in Las Vegas which makes it so convenient for people to come on in and try their food! I'm Thai and this place hits pretty close to moms home cooking.",

We have come here many times and have even recommended this place.  We will definitely do this no longer.  This evening they put us at a two top in a corner hidden to the side.  Our waiter took our order and it was as if he disappeared. No drink refills unless we asked my husband was drinking ice tea and I had ordered there lychee cooler. We also ordered three appetizers so we weren't being stingy. We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, the calamari and papaya salad with fresh shrimp. As in other reviews new tables arrived and they received there food before us. They completely forgot the papaya salad and after we mentioned it a papaya salad went to another table.  My Hell's Curry of which I told him has been to spicy (this let him know we've eaten here) still came out above the 2 that I asked for and mind you it was better then a 7 that I tried the first time.  During all of this we never saw our waiter again it was other people doing service.  I actually saw him look at our table and walk the other way and another time he opened a billfold and walked past us almost blatantly ignoring service.  My husband had to have a talk with the manager for us to get any response.  Absolutely appalling service. We loved this place but it's taken a turn.  No longer recommending nor going here anymore.  Truly a disappointment.",

If you like spicy, be careful there level 5 out of 10. With 0 being no spice to 10 spiciest. Is pretty spicy. & trust me when I can say I can handle spicy, I'm Hispanic lol. There drunken sew ew noodles have such a rich flavor if you like lost of veggies (like me) I'd ask for extra broccoli. On the multiple occasions I've gone thats the only thing I'd change. Majority of what I've had and sampled with my friends is amazing , I'll definitely be back.",

I ordered Padt Thai with Fried Tofu, Beef Jerky, Chicken with basil and they were all so tasty! The Padt Thai here is my fave in all that I've tasted in Vegas.   For dessert I ordered the table Thai tea creme brulee and coconut ice cream with sticky rice. I really enjoyed both but liked the brulee a bit more.   I would also like to add that that this place was packed on a Friday night but they found a way to seat us right away. The servers were quick, friendly, and very helpful.   I'm glad this place is right around the corner. They'll be seeing my face around a lot :)",

They were exceptionally kind to my toddler daughter who got her own little plate, utensils and kid cup without me asking.   The food was good.  My pad Thai was a bit sweet for my taste but still very high quality and enjoyable.  We went on a Saturday and there was no lunch special.  It was kind of expensive for the portions and lunch in general.  The only real complaint I had was the seriously horrible loud music they had playing.  It was so strange!  A combination of bad jazz and elevator music.  The other patrons were laughing at it as well.  It didn't fit the restaurant mood at all.   Stars for fast attentive service but lose a star for being overpriced.  We may be back, if it were less expensive, definitely.",

When I found out there is a thai restaurant 5 mins from my house, I know I have to try it out. The first experience was a take out order, I ordered the pad thai, and I thought it was pretty good. Then, I took my friend here to try it together.  The atmosphere here is great, it's a little dark, but the decorations and everything add the 'thai' feeling to the restaurant. The seats are pretty comfortable.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kung Soup, Panang Curry(Waitress suggested this one), and Pad Thai. The soup and pad thai was good, but nothing special. The most important thing is that the panang curry was awesome! It's better than red, yellow, or green curry that I have tried :)  Although the food was good, the portion was quite small for the price...",

    "text": "Once upon a time, during a quick trip to Vegas, I was determined to find great Thai food outside of California (specifically Hollywood/No Ho).  After much research, I was set on treating a very special man in my life (and extremely picky Thai food eater) to the much lauded Lotus of Siam.  However, being in the neighborhood, we decided to grab a bite at Pin-Kaow, and we were not disappointed.  Located in an unassuming strip mall off Rainbow & Lake Mead, the sign for Pin-Kaow, in big bold caps, is definitely not hard to miss.  However, for those unfamiliar with great Thai food, it may be easy to overlook.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were impressed with the elaborate traditional design.  Think intricately carved, polished wood, and slightly dim lighting.  Classy enough for a lovely dinner date, yet casual enough for quick daytime lunch.  This was exactly the kind of place  we had opted for.  We were seated promptly and given several different menus, one of which was for their lunch specials.  We both went with entrees and ended up ordering a bowl of boat noodles, red curry with chicken, nam kao tod  and spicy chili mint noodles.  Everything was ordered at a level of 7 or 8 spiciness, but be cautious with this spice level, as some dishes were spicier than others.  The boat noodles and curry were good and satisfied a craving, as did the spicy chili mint noodles.  The portions were big enough for two people with big appetites (or as my boyfriend would say, \"big enough to feed a small family.\")  However, what really made a big impression on us was the nam kao tod!  If you've never ordered this, you're missing out.  It's basically a crispy rice salad with sour sausage, cashews, lime juice, chili flakes, and other elements of deliciousness.  The texture, and bold flavor were a perfect complement to a sunny vegas afternoon in Spring.  Neither of us ordered from the drink menu, but they seem to have a nice beer selection for a reasonable price.  All in all, although I have yet to try the critically acclaimed \"Lotus\" in Vegas, Pin-Kaow is a nice (and more cost effective!) alternative.",

The Panang curry is really good too but if its just the 2 of us we cant usually eat more than the soup, rice, and noodles. We always have enough to take home even though we would like to eat all of it there. When the mango is in season we don't leave with out having the sweet sticky rice with mango and coconut milk.

    "text": "Excellent lunch specials and the busy crowd during the work week proves it!  (The owners opened up a second location so that tells you something.) My boss and I went there many times for lunch when the mortgage office was just around the corner (so convenient). The entire costumed staff (in very ornate and eye popping colors BTW, so pretty) is very nice and take care of you right away (the growing line permitting of course). Seating is both booths and tables. The furniture, decor and ambiance is very pretty- carved dark rich woods. Although it is a busy place, you are not ignored here and every customer is just as important. Single bathrooms behind the beaded curtain might have you waiting in the hall but hopefully the wait is not too long.  The lunch special is a good size: tasty soup, a spring roll, a fried wonton with the dipping sauces, the entree (many choices- but my favorites were curry chicken, pad thai, & thai beef salad), and a bowl of white rice. And you could customize spiciness too- I like medium to spicy. I don't think I was ever disappointed here- never had an off meal. Two people could eat here for less than $20.00 including the tip- during the work week.    I introduced my husband to this thai restaurant and he liked it a lot. We're not in the general area a whole lot since my work place has changed (including the boss), nor is this restaurant close to our home, either. If we were in the area, I would love to eat here again.",

There was no denying it because it was still attached to the pelvic region of the insect. I'm a pretty forgiving person but that's incredibly unsanitary.

They charge an extra $3 to substitute to brown rice and the portions were small. Go here if you have plenty of money but not that hungry!",

Been meaning to try this place out for a while, had heard good things; really glad we did. They were very busy as it was Friday night, but the service was excellent, the food hot and delicious. The restaurant is located in what is essentially a strip mall so I wasn't expecting the elegant interior. Next time I'll get more adventurous with the menu, but they did really well with my favorites first time out of the gate. The fried rice was excellent,  with huge pieces of tender duck. The crab Rangoon were light, fluffy and crisp, as was the lemon chicken. The satay were very tender and tasty. I didn't risk the beef because AJ asked for the heat too be at 8-10. He really enjoyed it though. We'll definitely go again.",

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nicely decorated and the staff was very authentic and attentive.  The wait was not very long at all, and the food was delicious.  The Tom Yum soup was BURSTING with flavor, amazing........  Probably the best I have ever had.. The Panang Curry was good, but the chicken tasted like it may have been a little on the undercooked side.  I really enjoyed having dinner here and I will be back when in town.",

    "text": "Two of my co-workers have been telling me that Pin Kaow is one of their favorite Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas.  Once I realized it was a mere 7 minute drive I knew I had to check it out.  I went with my husband on a Sunday afternoon, and I won't lie I was pretty taken back when I walked inside (in a good way).  The outside is your basic strip mall, but once you walk inside the decor makes you feel like you were transported out of Las Vegas and into Thailand (or at least what it might look like in my head since I have never been there).  The place had a good sized crowd, but there were still a few tables left.    Unfortunately, both my husband and I had a lot of work to do so we decided to order to go and did not get the full dining experience.  Despite not eating there, I was still impressed by their service.  The lady who took our order was very nice and we received our food very quickly.  After placing our order I think we were out the door in about 10 minutes.  When we go home and started to dig in we found out taste buds fully satisfied and stomach approved of the great portion sizes.    We ordered two basics, Chicken Pad Thai (9.95) and Beef Pad See Ew (9.95).  I know we weren't too adventurous, but I had to make sure they did the basics right.  Yay for Pin Kaow, both executed wonderfully and I recommend both dishes to anything thinking of trying this place.  I look forward to returning in the future to try their curries, rice dishes, and many more.  I'm pretty sure I've found my go to Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas",

The first time I blamed the person picking up the order for not checking before leaving the restaurant to see if they forgot anything. This time the item we ordered had been sold out AFTER we ordered but before we picked up so PinKaow decided to sub a different item and not tell us. They lied and said it was the item we ordered. When it was brought home it was obvious that we didn't get what we ordered. After a long wait on the phone we finally find out what happened and then they hung up. This is so beyond unacceptable. Their food is ok - WHEN you get what you ordered. I doubt we will come back.",

I told him No that I had asked for lemon sauce 20 minutes ago he realized he had forgotten us completely. I think they have more tables then they do kitchen equipment.

This time, not so bad, I am able to read and I know what stuff is.  Still coming here I was weary of what to get so I kept it simple with sweet and sour pork or was it chicken?  I can't remember and honestly I couldn't tell.  All I know it was chewy and sweet and not at all spicy like I had dreaded.    The restaurant was beautiful and all the staff was dressed to the nines.  I loved the traditional Thai garb the staff was wearing and all the big bosses were equally well dressed in business suits.  The staff was also very attentive with removing dishes and getting the orders in.  In a group of five and one late arrival, with tons of appetizers and dishes abound the manager took our order without a note pad and got everything right.  Very impressive.   I doubt I'd come back here on my own because I'm not a fan of spicy and it seems they have a lot of stuff I'm allergic to in a bunch of the dishes.  Even the sweet and sour um, whatever it was had tomato in it.  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  My friend mentioned it's either something you really love or something you really hate.  To me it was something I could really like.  Nice place and super busy but the staff handled it like real professionals.  I would recommend it if your up north and in the mood for Thai food.",

    "text": "This is my first time going to an actual Thai Restaurant, in which, I find this to be an interesting place. But there are some things that kind of stuck out, and kind of got to me.   A friend of my wife's invited us and a few of her co workers to Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant on the corner of Rainbow and Lake Mead. It was very easy to find off 95. Its about a 10-15 minute drive from the Las Vegas Strip.   The location of the restaurant, is on the corner of lake mead and rainbow, which was an easy access to get in, but from the looks of it, its kind of hard to get out. Since its right next to the stop light and, for those who want to get on Rainbow, its kind of busy intersection, not unless you get on lake mead, going the opposite way to make a u-turn some where later and get on Rainbow.   The set up of the restaurant is nice, but it could probably be more spacious if they use a little bit less tables to move around. Mainly, i keep tapping the other table with my leg or bottom and saying excuse me a lot cause the tables are so close together, and I'm not really that big.   The staff, was very pleasant, very well dressed in their Thai uniform and made sure that we were happy with our stay. Knowing that it is lunch time, I'm sure it was kind of busy for them to get out orders. So I probably wouldn't hold that against them, knowing its during the busy hours. They were fully staff to make sure everyone is helped and that they got to us as soon as they can. I would probably say 5-10 minutes would be a decent time to be waiting during busy hours. They seem to make it in between those times to meet my needs.   The food itself was unique. But I have to say, its been a while since I had spicy food, so it didn't really set well with me. My wife ordered some chicken entree and shared it with her. We thought it would be a big serving, but it was an average serving for one person. But over all it was good to have something different. I did love their fried shrimp appetizer that had cream cheese in them and of course the egg rolls were great.  I did love the dessert of, Fried Banana and Coconut Ice Cream, it did make me love the place even more.    Over all, I would probably say, this was a decent place to have lunch. If your into spicy food and something unique, then its a must go place to eat. The appetizers are great, as well as dessert.  But I would suggest to go during the slow hours, cause getting out and trying to get back onto 95 or Rainbow. it's better to find an alternate route, or wait till some one is nice enough to let you into traffic. Enjoy.",

    "text": "After a rather boisterous night from my 20mth old nephew & barely getting through our soup (which was divine, i'll get back to that shortly) we had everything packed up to-go.   Rewind to the beginning of the night after making our selections, our soup Tom - Ka - Koong was first on the table.   A rich blend of lemon grass soup, coconut & galanga root, light on the palate, explosive in taste. Although the mushroom & shrimp were more of an after thought in the soup, it doesn't stop you from appreciating this elixir of yum! If anything I'd like to have the soup bottled to go & drink it like water!  As our entrees trickled in, the Thai BBQ chicken in first, followed by Black Bean Scallop...  My jaw-dropped in epic disappointment as I gazed at the dish, which was poorly plated not a single sense of appeal to it, like cheap chopsuey. For $15 you'd expect to see some effort into it...  Fast forward we continued dinner at home with a bottle merlot to boot. The house wasn't that far so our dishes were still fairly warm. As we sunk our teeth into what seemed like Thai BBQ chicken jerky. The meat was dry of epic proportions! Wherein we forced it down with the merlot. Taste-wise it seems all of it had dissipated.  Black bean scallops...not even a hint of black bean sauce, it just tasted like cheap chopsuey. The scallops were cooked well, soft & melts in your mouth. Poorly executed dish.",

Service was decent.  -Duck Fried Rice : a must get here. The rice and duck were moist and flavorful.  -Pa Kao - It is a seafood version of Tom Yum. Soup was too sour.  -Salt and Pepper Soft Shell Crab - it was really good but a bit salty. meant to be a dish to be eaten with rice I guess but we were too full. Spicy alert! There was green chilies in the dish. Beware.  -Steamed Seabass Bangkok style - my favorite dish!!! the seabass was tender and creamy. The sauce complimented the fish well  -Mango Salad - it was alright. did not like it with the tofu.  -Pad Prik King - This dish should be in the sauteed section. Our was beef sauteed with green bean in curry spices. Dry dish. It is not a curry dish with broth/ soup like other curry dishes. Pretty good.",

    "text": "I've been to and have worked in many different restaurants over the years and I can honestly attest that the 1974 N. Rainbow location (one of several in town) of Pin Kaow Thai Restaurants is among not only the best Thai restaurants I've been to, but among the best restaurants overall that I've enjoyed.      Right off the bat one refreshing thing about Pin Kaow is its location. On the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow Blvd it's a location convenient enough to save anyone from my side of town (NW side) a trip all the way down to Spring Mountain road or \"Chinatown\" where most of the cities sought after authentic Asian restaurants are located. There's also plenty of parking out front, a nice change of pace that you don't usually get with most Spring Mountain restaurants.  It can be hard to spot at night however so I would just remind people that it is directly across the street from a \"Joes Crab Shack\" and has a large \"Windmill Water Refilling\" station in the front parking lot.      The overall appearance of the restaurant inside is very clean and very nice. With wall to wall teak wood furniture, comfortable dim lighting, traditional Thai decor including floral arrangements and an average restaurant noise level, Pin Kaow feels very warm, comfortable and inviting. It's the kind of restaurant that makes you and your party lose track of the time and simply enjoy each other's company.       Service at Pin Kaow based on our experience has been great. Immediately upon entering you're greeted by the very friendly and energetic hostess staff wearing traditional Thai costume who after seating you will sometimes deliver you your drink order (if the servers are busy).  The Servers are also polite and knowledgeable with the menu, and thankfully will talk certain patrons out of ordering beyond their capabilities when it comes to the spicy levels of the food (levels 1-10).        Last but not least the menu. With all of the positives this place has going for it, if the food wasn't up to par, I simply would not go. But the food however is GREAT, and comparable to any other Thai restaurant in town, including those located on Spring Mountain rd. I would recommend starting with the chicken skewers served with a side of peanut sauce, followed by an entree of either the beef Pad Thai or Cashew Chicken, finished with a dessert of Sticky Rice with Mango then washed down with happy hours two for one \"Chang\" brand Thai beers.",

Don't be deceived by the small serving plates, this is a gigantic lunch. I always have to take half to go. Lunch specials come with soup to start (usually some sort of chicken or tofu soup), egg roll or salad, and some other fried pocket thing that I can't identify but tastes good.   I must admit that I do wish that they took my requests for a spicy level 10 seriously. It's like they just roll their eyes and give me a 5. If you ask for the spice rack though you can add extra spice as you please. You know what makes up for this? Extra cold beers. They serve the beers with a frozen mug. I've even had a server suggest I get two small beers instead of one large one so I can keep them as cold as possible. How considerate! Pin Kaow definitely does it right when it comes to running an efficient restaurant with great food and awesome service.",

So don't expect huge tasteless, greasy portions, like some other Thai restaurants.  It is noisy during lunch time because of how busy they are, and that's to be expected with lunch specials under $10.  My favorite entree is the Chinese broccoli with crispy fried pork although it is not a lunch special.  Succulent, crispy, and tender pork with young Chinese broccoli.

My favorite menu item is the Tom kha, the aromatics they use are profoundly authentic to the flavors of Thailand.  Long live the lime leaves & lemon grass shoots!    Always great service, the bathrooms are kept immaculately clean, the ambiance set well with attractive decor making the environment is comfortable.   I really dig the mango & sticky rice.   yum!",

    "text": "In my opinion,  Pin Koaw is the best Thai restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley region.  The restaurant is located in a commercial strip on the southeast corner of Rainbow & Lake Mead. The space is fairly large with teak tables & accents. I've eaten here at least ten times during the past five years.    My favorite dish is the larb gai (chopped chicken) with fresh veggies.  It's served with lettuce leaves to eat as a wrap. I order it as an off-menu item entree. The entree will come with a serving of deliciously fragrant Thai rice. Spicy  larb gai and cold  Singha ( Thai beer) is a great pairing.  Yesterday, my family of nine decided to meet up here for lunch. I enjoyed the  Pad Thai lunch  w/ tofu special.  The dish- Rice noodles sauteed with bean sprouts, green onion, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe. Delicious! My meal is prepped at an eight spice level (one  to ten spice scale), gage it, and add more chili, if needed. Yes, I like my food spicy.  An egg drop soup is served for starters. Fantastic lunch deal for $8.95.   The service is warm & polite. My siblings and family really enjoy this  place for Thai cuisine.",

For my main course I had the Pad Thai, lvl 5 for spicy out of 10 which was the perfect level of heat.  They also carry Thai beer. I was excited to see they carried Singha beer. A great beer to complement a spicy dish.  Pin Kaow is a must try if your in the mood for good Thai food.  Only downfall was that service was extremely slow. To their credit it was lunch rush.",

The BEST Tom Kha (except I had shrimp instead of chicken) soups I've ever had. Lots of shrimp (tender), lots of lime, coconut, chunks of ginger and galangal. Excellent. I also had duck with Chinese broccoli. The duck was sliced thin, was tender and the entire dish was lightly covered with a not-too-sweet delicious sauce.

I usually order panang, larb, pad see ew, pad thai, and Tom Yum majority of the time and they've always been scrumptious and splendid! I've never really ever had a bad experience with my visits here nor the South Rainbow one. So far, this place is a five-star and I highly recommend it. Food's delicious, service was consistent, wait was fair, atmosphere's welcoming and mellow, and prices are good!  (This is a copy/paste of the same review I left for the S. Rainbow Pin Kaow. Just thought I might as well leave a great review for the North as well since my experiences with both were fantastic!) Hope others can agree!",

Though it's located in a strip mall, the interior decor is quite nice, and the service was on point throughout our visit: attentive, polite, and professional. I was impressed before we even got to the food.  Started with the Fishcakes app- $8. Good portion for the price, cakes weren't too greasy and seemed meatier than others we've had. Herbs and seasonings were mixed into the patties, making them quite flavorful. The cucumber salad was also fresh and flavorful, perfectly complement to the cakes. Shared the hotpot of tom kha kai soup- $12. Large hot pot serving is good for us, since we love this soup. First impression of the dish was that it was incredibly well balanced. The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself. Lastly, we split the duck curry entree- $14. As my BF put it, \"This is possibly the best curry I've ever had.\" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.  All in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great.",

I was working when I placed the order and was not being paid overtime because of it being a holiday, but that is not the point. Unfortunately they have lost all of my business. I will not be returning to their location because they wanted to charge the dinner portions during lunch hours on a Monday(holiday).

The decor is very impressive to the point of being over the top but hey, you can tell they care a LOT about getting it right.   I got duck curry at an 8 spice level, I am used to being nearly in pain at an 8, but it was very manageable here. Very tasty dish and I'll look forward to trying more.  service was a little slow,  But they were friendly when you had their attention.",

The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is that it was quite a wait to get our food, even though it's a small restaurant.  We waited about 30 mins after we ordered for our food to come out, and all 3 dishes came out separate.  Don't let that discourage you though! The pot-stickers were the best I've had. Both our dishes were great, and we even split a jasmine tea that finished the meal perfectly.  It was fairly cheap, especially for the food you're getting. They're not huge portions, but not small either, just the right size.  Go check this place out!! Very good food!",

About half of that was spent in Okinawa, and we were TDY to Thailand almost half of that.  I could speak passable Thai at one time, and even though my accent now is terrible (Thai is a tonal language, so accent and inflection are essential) when I don't even look a the menu and order in Thai, I expect something authentic.  I ordered papaya salad with sticky rice and pahd see yew.  Both came out bland, and the Nam Phrik had jalapenos and not ki noo peppers.  Lotus of Siam made this same mistake.  I won't go back to either unless I'm desperate.  If you want real, authentic Thai street food, hit Thai-Style Noodle House on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn or Pon Ocha Soup on Nellis and Stewart.",

    "text": "When I walked in, I thought, \"We're not in Vegas anymore.\" Floor to ceiling wood paneling, Thai pop and servers outfitted in traditional attire, transported me to a magical, happy place. I love it when an unassuming strip mall spot knocks me off my design feet. For this reason alone, put this spot on your short list for dates and other occasions that require impressing. It is the perfect combination of adventurous eats with charming surroundings.  The service was friendly, but they failed to inform us that brown rice is an additional $3/person! Mouth dropping upcharge. When our bill arrived, we informed them of our concern, and they kindly only charged us for one brown rice. Sadly, having to pay $6 for both me and my husband to enjoy brown rice will probably prevent us from returning. I know it seems like a small thing, but that is practically the price of an entire entree during lunch specials, which they do offer with soup, eggroll and fried wonton.  Even so, I can say that the red curry is a fine specimen of curry. The server recommended the massaman, but it is not available as a lunch special. The chicken and rice soup was a bit salty; the egg roll was simply ok, and the fried wonton is just an odd item to me without at least some variety of filling.  Overall, the food and environment are top notch, but I happen to be a brown rice stickler. It's just one of my things. Still, I love a place in Vegas that does the strip mall proud.",

I've had salty-as-hell massaman, nearly-raw massaman, and flavorless massaman.  I gave this a try.  This was Very Good Massaman. The potatoes were actually cooked through. The shrimp still had the tails on them, which I hate, but they were good. The sauce was tasty (though somewhat  reminiscent of tomato bisque soup). I really enjoyed that dish.  The decor was pleasant- wood everywhere, not overly crowded with tables. The floor didn't look as if it had been swept for a couple of days, though (sorry, Pin Kaow- that evening sun shows everything on a smooth shiny surface!)  I tried the rice and coconut ice cream for dessert and was not impressed with the rice, as it was gummy.  I'll come back for more more massaman, but no dessert for me.",

For appetizers, we enjoy the Sweet & Sour Cucumbers and the Edamame.  When you order your entree, you tell the waiter how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the spiciest level.  I generally get a 5 or 6.  Service - The employee to customer ratio in this restaurant is pretty high.  My guess is that they don't make very much in terms of an hourly wage.  Either way, the service is always good.

Strap in and buckle down for some spicy soup served in a bowl that is literally on fire (get either the Wor Wonton or the Tom Yum Koong -- though my dad just describes these as the soups with the shrimp and the spicy and the lettuce). Ordered:  Chicken Sat Tay -- Delicious! Only comes with four though, might want to get more.  Masaman with Tofu, level 6 -- Not that spicy. Could have definitely added a few notches to get a real kick in the face.   Chicken BBQ -- I'm not a big fan of this but everyone else gulped it down. I just think it's not spicy enough.   Spicy, soup, with the shrimp and the noodle things -- as my dad called it. I have no idea what the waitress brought (I think one of the wonton soups), but it was pretty tasty. The wonton soups don't give you a lot of shrimp so if your taste buds are flamingo-like in tendency you should order the Tom Yum Koong.   All very good. Top it off with a Thai Ice Tea that could only be better if someone could figure out how to put alcohol in it. Kahula maybe? Cheers!",

First, I will note that, as is common with Vegas restaurants, it's not the cheapest Thai restaurant.  However, they always seem to be busy, and you can see why with the quality of the food (I've had the yellow and massaman curries and the spicy eggplant with tofu - the yellow curry was passable, and the massaman curry and spicy eggplant were fantastic).  I'd say it's one of the few places in Las Vegas where the quality of the food actually reflects the price.  Now, keeping that in mind, the best Thai food I've ever had cost me $6 and I would've easily paid $20 for it.   Overall, even though it's not quite \"As Good as it Gets\" for a 5-star rating, Pin-Kaow makes for a nice but still affordable Thai option in Las Vegas, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice evening out.",

The interior of the restaurant is nicer than most other strip mall Thai places I have been to and it was fairly busy when I was there midday.

They do spice on a 1-10 scale and are right on the money.  Not like others where the spices are subtle, here a 7 in spice is solid and did an 8 once and ate t but it was very much at that edge.  Lunch specials are awesome.  Its sister restaurant on Eastern has skimpier portions and is good but not great.    Almost every dish Ive eaten there has been spot on.",

When you see \"Chow Mein\" or \"Mixed Chinese Noodles with a Thai Sauce\" on the menu it makes you wonder.  To be fair, they do have a good selection of curries, but the rest of their menu paled in comparison with other Thai places I've visited.  I had the Tom Yum soup, which was simply wonderful and full of lemongrass, mushrooms, and shrimp.  I also had the wide rice noodle with chili, mint, and shrimp (most places call it \"drunken noodles\"), again, very good and the waiter was helpful in guiding me in selecting a \"hot\" level.  I also had a Thai beer and finished the meal with mango and sweet sticky rice was was absolutely fantastic.  The wait staff seemed to light up when you actually ordered Thai specialties.  I would definitely go here again, but just ignore the Chinese food on the menu.",

I get the Lemongrass Trout with Tilapia instead because I don't like to bother with picking out the bones. The dish is delicious and I wish I could eat it every day. I want to try other dishes, but I keep going back to my favorites. Guess I need to go with a bigger group!",

The food was just so bland and lacked the quality it use to have. Before, Pin Kaow was the best thai restaurant in Vegas, but I don't think that is True anymore. Hopefully I'll find one that I enjoy like I did with Pin Kaow when it use to be really good.",

The service was pleasant but unexceptional when we ate there. It was too crowded to really have a pleasant meal.  The food is what brings us back. It is amazing! Based on my body's response, I don't think they add MSG.  You order your level of spicy taste. I recommend starting low and adding as you become familiar with their system. I enjoy food at around a 7. My wife likes her's at level 4.  The kids pallet doesn't take to the food here at all, so it is usually a take out lunch purchase. Good place to have a grown-up outing as I have not seen kids there.",

They play Thai music and serve many traditional Thai alcolohic beers, too.   The food is superb, up there with the atmosphere. My favorite is probably Tom Ka Kai soup and tofu and mint entre and mango and sticky rice desert. But, it's hard to choose sometimes, as all of it is extremely delicious! Their curries are good, their salads are out of this world, and the service is excellent. Take out is also offered.  Overall, I am glad that I tried this place, despite the unadorned exterior.

You cannot beat their amazing lunch special deals and portions. Every time I fly back into town, they are my first stop to remind me of home- literally calling a to go order in the car from the airport.

Seriously if you want to open a thai restaurant, be a thai restaurant. Dont be like PF Changs. Chinese restaurant wannabe. Thats how I feel about this restaurant. Cant change anything, food are mediocre, although service are attentive, they should be cos hey charge almost double than any regular thai restaurant with better food.

On Valentine's Day I placed a to go order. Received a email confirmation saying \"Thank you for placing an order\" and \"your order is being processed\" at 5:48pm. My husband arrives to pick up at 6:30 when the man named (Jeb) tells him they didn't receive our order, then argues with him telling him the order was not complete. We told him about the emails we received and he still continues to say the order isn't complete. Then shows my husband the screen and our order is complete they just didn't enter it correctly. After showing him the order he tells my husband- Do you still want it? Well- of course we want it. My husband had to wait an additional 25 mins then has the nerve to say he will not charge us for the Pot Stickers which are $7.95, which is the cheapest item we ordered and our order total was $61.43. Talk about HORRIBLE customer service!! We will never go back to Pin Kaow again!! Very furious with their awful customer service!!!",

    "text": "Family and I have been going to Pin Kaow for years, and it was always one of our go-to Thai restaurants in Las Vegas!  Was in Las Vegas last weekend for a friend's wedding, but I had time to go grab lunch with my parents at Pin Kaow in the Northwest part of town off of Lake Mead and Rainbow. We ordered from the lunch menu special. I got the red curry with chicken, and my parents got the pad thai with beef and the basil chicken. Each of the lunch specials is between $8-10, depending on the type of meat that you get with it. Beef and seafood are a little bit more expensive, while chicken and tofu fall on the cheaper end.  We also got a couple appetizers - the fish cake ($8.95), as well as the chicken satay ($8.95). My dad is a huge fan of both of these dishes, and we've been ordering them since I was a little kid. The fish cake is served with the thai sweet chili sauce with the cucumber, which you should put on top of your fish cake. So yummy! The chicken satay has the peanut sauce on the side, which we are also huge fans of. We also ordered a couple drinks, and with tax, lunch came out to about $50 for 3 people, so not too shabby at all.  The 800 other times we have been here, we have also ordered things like the beef rad nar, which has the thicker noodles with beef, broccoli and a gravy sauce. We also like the mint chicken, shrimp pad thai, and yellow curry. I always get my dishes with a spice level of 5 (on a 10 point scale) and it is just right.   Now if you ask me where it falls on the scale of best Thai restaurants, I have to give the nod to Lotus of Siam first (5-star), and then it's a close decision between Pin Kaow and Archi's. I may have to give the nod to Archi's here though, because their flavor and spices seem to be a little bit better than Pin Kaow. Nonetheless, it is still a great option. The service here is better than Archi's and other Thai restaurants, and the ambience is terrific. It's also conveniently located about 2 miles away from my parent's house and was always the most feasible option for us. Love the food, love the service, will definitely be back.",

We get the usual noob stuff, pad thai, chicken pinang curry, pad see ew beef. My in laws come so often the waitresses usually know their order. Spring rolls- get them because they come out piping hot. Crab ragoons are pretty good. If you are spice sensitive I would ask if the cook is heavy handed or not, sometimes the 4 is too spicy. Service is usually always really good, fast and attentive, some staff do have thick accents (I'm Asian and not hating). And if you wanted to do an add on while eating, they are usually quick to get the dish out. We've ordered take out and that service has been good too.",

Not only do they have awesome lunch specials (an entree, spring roll and a fried wonton for a very reasonable price), they're also not extremely busy like they are at dinner time. The wait at night can be up to 45 minutes.  What I normally get: Thai iced tea, fried tofu, spring rolls, chicken wings, pad Thai, crispy pork with Chinese broccoli, satay, combination fried rice and sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert (when it's in season around May-July).  I've been going here since I moved to Vegas in 2006 and I can't recall having a bad experience.  I've been to other Thai restaurants but Pin Kaow is my favorite because the service and the food are always consistent plus, the location is convenient.  Their spiciness rating is from 1-10 (it doesn't fluctuate).",

The menu clearly said the soup was $7.95 for a bowl with a choice of chicken or shrimp. It also said that the hotpot (a larger bowl) was $12.95 with chicken or shrimp but shrimp was $2 more. The waiter insisted that the extra $2 applied to the bowl as well and charged me $9.95.  There wasn't anything really special about the soup (even though it was well-made) and certainly the portion was not large enough to be worth $10.   The food was good if you feel like paying extra.",

The staff all dressed in Thai clothing. Very cute and inviting! They offer a great lunch special! Which I got. Pad Thai (#3 spicy level), came with; egg soup, side salad (you could also choose from egg rolls, fried rice, white rice, or soup). You also not only have choices of meat, but any meat meal can be subbed for tofu, which is what I got. The food was to die for!!!!! The soup was hot and perfect! The salad dressing was on point and my pad Thai.... Perfection! I believe the lunch special was $8.95, not bad especially since I took half home for dinner! Will definitely come back! Excited to explore more of that menu!",

Next to an unremarkable gambling joint is Pin Kaow Thai.  Walking in, the space is cozy with traditional Thai decor.  It doesn't try to be pretentious, or overly modern,  but welcoming and warm.    I started with the chicken tom kha.  Delightfully aromatic & silky, with the perfect amount of tartness.   Next selection was the chicken wings.  Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside with a generous coating of sweet chili sauce.    Dinner kept getting better with the arrival of the shrimp pad see ew & chicken massaman curry.   The pad see ew was incredibly flavorful and the ingredients they used were discernibly fresh.  The massaman curry was equally excellent with tender pieces of chicken and potato, and a wonderful textural contrast from the chopped peanut.   Overall, would absolutely be back.  The service was attentive without being disruptive and the food was phenomenal.",

The dim lights and the decorations gave it such a date vibe. She suggested to start off with the Tom yum soup. I personally don't like seafood in soups but the shrimp was actually very nice. You could actually taste the lemongrass in the soup and it was a very tangy soup. I wouldn't of tried it if she had never suggested it. My friend ordered a coconut water to drink and they brought her a whole coconut with the top off and a straw inside. It was perfectly chilled and sooo yummy. For it being my first time eating thai food I had to get a thai tea! So yummy I wish it want so expensive because I would have gotten like 3 haha.  After awhile of ordering we finally received our pad thai. I came in a giant family plate and you serve yourself from there. Once we started eating we unfortunately found a hair in our food. *cringe* the staff apologized and took our plate. We had to wait again to continue our meal. At this point we kept eating but at this point my experience here had tarnished.",

Not ideal as the restaurant is only 15 mins away, but not a deal-breaker. I didn't have the car to go pick it up anyway.   The delivery driver somehow got lost along the way, and I wasn't able to hear him over his car radio when he called in confusion. I tried calling him back, but he couldn't hear or understand me either. Finally, I called the restaurant and had them call him, which sorted everything out. He arrived 10 mins later. So, I'd dock a half star for that confusion and the less than ideal wait time.   The food was not bad. The beef jerky was incredible: moist and flavorful. The chicken pad thai tasted sweet, which surprised me because I'd asked for a spice level of 8. It was not spicy at all. But it was still flavorful, and they had heeded my request to avoid adding the egg. The garlic prawns---again, I had asked for a spice level of 9, but it wasn't even slightly spicy. The prawns were a nice size and the vegetables were fresh, but the lack of heat let it down for me.",

    "text": "Hahaha... this has to be one of the worst thai restaurants I've tried in a while.   Called in an order and they said it would be ready in 20 to 25 minutes. I headed over in 30 minutes. It took an hour (from when I called) before I was walking out the door. I assume they forgot my order during the lunch rush or ended up giving it to someone else by accident.   When I got home and checked out the food, it was fairly under-portioned. The food was also VERY bland. This goes for both the pad thai and curry. GF and I agreed that the quality was mediocre at best... imagine a cheap china buffet.   I would say that the only upside is that the price is cheaper than other thai restaurants in the area.",

It comes with a choice of soup or salad, egg roll or fried wonton, and an entree all for about 10 bucks!   I've tried the pad thai and red curry on the lunch special menu, and the pad see ew on the normal menu. The portion sizes are pretty filling and I normally end up having to take the rest home. You can choose a spicy level from 1-10. I normally get around a 6, which is actually not too spicy. The red curry is my current fav. So creamy and flavorful! Paired with a Thai iced tea, a perfect meal!   The service is hit or miss. I've come when it is really fast and efficient, but I've also experienced having to wait a while for my food. The staff is always super friendly though and the restaurant is always clean.",

I can't really put my finger on what it is that's missing from their food but it doesn't have the depth of flavor that I'm used to from places like Komol and Lotus.

We actually had a problem with the first table we were seated at because the sun was shining through the blinds and burning our eyes, so we asked to move somewhere else. They moved us over to a better spot near the back that was half booth, half chairs.   Whenever I go out with my boyfriend and his family, we always get a lot of food, so I made sure to starve myself almost all day and by the time we got there I was ready to attack the food!   We ordered: Spring rolls Crab rangoon  Garlic beef - cabbage & broccoli with sauteed meat in garlic sauce Cashew nut chicken - sauteed cashew nut, dried chili w/ Thai chili sauce Chicken Panang curry - Thai special curry paste with coconut milk, green beans, basil leaves and lime leaves Shrimp Red Curry - red Thai special curry paste with coconut mik, bamboo shoot and Thai basil leaves Spare Ribs - Spare ribs marinated in Thai BBQ sauce Chicken pad Thai - rice noodles sauteed with bean sprout, egg and crushed peanuts in Thai special recipe Chow mein - stir fried soft yellow noodle with mixed vegetables And of course, about 3 large orders of white rice  Our appetizers came out quick. They were both okay, nothing special though. I mean, how can you really make spring rolls and crab rangoons sensory explosive anyhow?  All of our food started coming out and that's when I said to myself,  \"Oh yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about.\" All the plates looked so good.I didn't even know where to start, so I just started with everything.   The garlic beef was delish. I love almost everything with garlic, so that wasn't a surprise. The cashew chicken was good. The chicken Panang curry was almost orgasmic. Almost is a good thing though, since I was with my boyfriend's family! The shrimp red curry was interesting. I guess I'm not much of a seafood curry fan, but at least I gave it a try. Mmmm, that spare ribs were scrumptious! So tender and juicy! The chicken pad Thai was pretty bomb. It had lots of crushed peanuts, which I liked.   The whole time we were eating, which was about an hour, the waitress made sure to keep our water glasses filled and would ask how we liked our food. We never had to ask for anything, except lemons to clean our hands at the end because we're Filipino.   All in all, I really enjoyed this place. I'm glad they opened a location on S. Rainbow, because that's a 2 minute drive from my house.",

Uck.  The very pretty \"silver\" container that the side of rice comes in is a nice presentation, but the plastic (?) doesn't keep the rice warm at all :-(  Mint chili noodles had a great flavour, but no mint?  Spice eggplant was great as always.  Service is quick, efficient and helpful.  And they stay open between lunch and dinner hours!!!  (Charge dinner prices).",

Staff is friendly and the interior of the restaurant is delightful and comfortable.  On the down side the amount of meat placed in the dishes is stingy to the point my friends and I went to 168 for a whole duck and picked dishes from here as sides. For example the tom yung koong they put 8 shrimp which sounds like a lot but really isn't and if you want more they charge $1.50 per shrimp. They won't even add extra duck to any of the duck orders. The pork fried rice had less than 1 ounce of pork in it. At that rate what's the point of calling it pork or chicken or whatever meat you get in the dish because there is barely any meat.   That's why this deserves 3 stars instead of 4. If you are a meat eater don't expect to get much from this place; however if you are fine with that then expect a flavorful experience.",

    "text": "This is our everyday Thai place since it's in Summerlin near where we live. We tend to do takeout most of the time and always order the wontons (an appetizer), the minced chicken dish and the chicken larb. The Chinese wontons are a strange order for us at a Thai place, but they're some of the best I've had. Really weird. Really yummy. The minced chicken and anything they do in this fashion I find to be good. Not the best, but good. Flavor won't blow you away but prices are normal. The spice level is honestly too mild for me, but I love it spicy. I get Thai hot.   I love the large portions. Ambiance and decor are nice. Cozy and cute for a date night.",

No bueno.    By the way, no photos - I thought about taking pics when my bowl was just about empty.",

Chicken Pad Thai comes with an egg roll, Rangoon, and soup all for just $7.95!  I was shocked and amazed not only at the price, but the quality of food that was served.  Other Thai restaurants charge at least $11-$12 for the same thing, but without all the extras.  This place is far superior to any other Thai restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley.  As for service, it was excellent.  Our waters didn't get close to half empty before being refilled.  Also the attention to detail on our orders was second to none.  I'd heard great things about this place in the past, and I must say that I'm hooked.  Expect to see me at least once a week to enjoy your amazing food.  Thank you so much for keeping up a phenomenal establishment.",

Food - 2.5/5 I was really excited to go to this spot. My original destination was a different spot near the strip, but with my Uber driver's strong recommendation my friend and I decided to try out. Portion was very small, especially Thai food being one of my favorite types of food. I've been to many different Thai places. We ordered many plates between two of us. Before we saw the portion, we were 100% sure that we'd have many Togo boxes coming back to the hotel with us. But, we finished most of the food. You'd think that because the food was tasty.. NO. NO. If we weren't hungry enough, we wouldn't have even eaten the food. They were mostly very salty. Besides food being salty and a small portion, it seemed like they were using a pretty good quality of seafood and others. We had ordered, gulf of Thai, fried cream cheese, papaya salad, chicken satay, and shrimp pad see weu.  Service - 4/5 Staff here were very friendly but a bit slow on refills on drinks.   Overall, I'm sad to say my 20min drive from my hotel was just a waste of time. I'm being pretty generous on my overall 3 stars.",

We walked in and were impressed by the atmosphere - on the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it's decorated beautifully and looks very modern inside. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par and I was very disappointed.  I ordered chicken pad thai at a 6, my usual order. It came and was definitely not a 6 - tasted more like a 3 or 4. It was so dry...didn't taste fresh to me and I kind of think it was reheated- it came out so quickly, less than 10 minutes after we ordered, and the restaurant was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon. There was hardly any chicken in it, and the chicken that was in there was all gristle! It was DISGUSTING. I ate maybe 1/4 of my dish and ended up spitting out most of the chicken, which is not really my favorite thing to be seen doing in a restaurant.   Service was good, though nobody questioned why my meal was practically untouched. They bring out oranges when you're finished which is a lovely gesture, but I can't see myself returning. I really hope to find a better Thai place!",

    "text": "I was staying at the Courtyard Marriott Summerlin hotel and this gem was just diagonally across the street! It had BEST in Las Vegas votes for many years displayed on the window. As you walked in you were in awe at how it transports you to Thailand! It had the building architecture and decor which added to the ambience of being in Asia. Complete with a fish tank! It was busy for a late Wed lunch and still it was packed.  I ordered: Bbq spareribs- tasted like the Chinese chai-shu ribs which are red. I am not fond of these usually and had expected a different kind so this was not for me. But for people who did not grow up with this, they may like it bc it is different to them. 2 stars  Pad See Ew- this was good overall ( forgot to tell them do not put eggs in it- this dish often has a bit of scrambled eggs which I don't like in my noodles of any kind).  3.5 stars  Spring rolls- ok( some Thai places have vermicelli threads in there with mushrooms which is my favorite-this was not it) just like Chinese egg rolls. 3 stars for ok.  Pumpkin curry with fried tofu- it can come with meats or fried or regular tofu. This was very good with diced chunks of kombucha squash ( I make mine with actual sugar pie pumpkin roasted first- da bomb, but many Thai restaurants use the kombucha squash which is good too.)! The curry sauce/stew was a perfect blend and fresh basil, assorted colored bell peppers only enhance the melting flavors. 3.5 stars  Angel wings- few places have this I think bc it is a lot of work to make. It is hard to find. This wing is stuffed with ground pork and looks like maybe a bit of vermicelli noodle threads and they give you two in a order bc these are bigger than the usual wings. And deep fried all together. This was ok- good but not the best I have had in SF. But it will be enough of a fix bc like I said it seems rare to find this in restaurants in the first place and even more rare to find a really great one. But go ahead and give it a try for something different than the usual wings. It is still good- so 3 stars and make sure to dip it in the sauce.  So overall a rating of 3 for the food. Service is friendly and fantastic-5 stars. Ambience and feeling transported to Thailand I give it 4.5 stars and great to take a romantic date on! Prices decent. Overall, good place to try and tastes authentic.",

I came in during lunch time so for 11 bucks i would say it's worth it. I wish there was a bit more flavor, and maybe a dash more peanuts. I wouldn't make this my favorite Thai place but it was a nice spot for a quick bite to eat.   Staff is very attentive! My water never made it past the half way mark lol. It's the little things in life.",

We went in the hostess was very friendly and we were immediately seated, which is awesome for a Friday night. However this is where it become obvious. There were people that were seated after us, their orders were taken, their drinks brought to them, while we waited.  Then our waiter would turn around and smile and ask us.   He would check on everyone else in his section and basically just left us, I believe the lady that was checking on us was the manager. As she is the one that brought us our to go boxes. IDK. There were people that finished their meals, got their checks, and left- all of whom came in after us. When he would finally check on us it was after alot of waiting.   This does not make me happy in the least. We didn't come in looking bummie either, as I had just gotten off of work.   However onto the food.  We got the pot stickers, beef noodle soup,  cashew chicken, roti, and the creme brulee made with green tea. All of the food was wonderful. I would def Uber Eat or Postmate this, but as far as coming back in, I dont think so. The blatant disregard was obvious.",

However, he's not a fan of the location in Henderson that is closest to our house and we are rarely near this location. Well, we ended up at a nearby store and decided to stop in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.   I love the decor and the dresses that the host/servers wear! They also offer an extensive menu with a lot of interesting options. My Husband told me that the crab ragoon is the best he's ever had (strong words!), so we started with that as an appetizer. It certainly didn't disappoint - it was really tasty! I am not sure what they add to them, but it might be crack. We then shared an order of pananang curry (with chicken), and ordered it at a zero spice level since we would be sharing with our toddler. To be honest, this wasn't my favorite pananang, but it was good. I am not a huge fan of green beans and that was the only vegetable added to it. Additionally, there wasn't much chicken - the dish was mostly sauce (if that makes sense).  Overall, it was a nice lunch and I would definitely go back. Everyone was super friendly and also very kind to our daughter.",

We were seated immediately - came in on a Thursday night around 8pm, not packed but not empty - but it took around 20 min for a waitress to come say hi and just take our drink orders. Then we waited for food for another 25-30 min. so my hangry side came out unfortunately.   But overall, willing to try again with the service since the food was so on point.",

Take out is always approximately 20 minutes which is just enough time to grab it on the way home from work or drive from my house/work to pick up. They package well for to-go orders so nothing spills or gets everywhere.  I suggest going ACROSS Rainbow going south on Lake Mead and turning on that first right, otherwise it's just a bit more work to get there crossing traffic and getting in the Outback Steakhouse parking lot.  This area of town is fairly nice and I don't worry about our daily race/show car or nicer truck getting messed with.  My biggest compliment is that they offered to bring my entire order to my car because I had sleeping babies with me!!! Such great help there, and they asked for ID with card which is awesome",

They put a lot of effort into their ambiance and it shows!  You wouldn't guess it looked this way from the outside and the neighboring buildings.  I haven't explored the menu too thoroughly because I'm just hooked to their green chicken curry! So good I have to it every time I go.  My fiance usually gets the Pad Thai,  which is also very good.  I believe they offer shrimp or chicken as their meat choices  He also really enjoys their green curry with catfish.  Service is always good.  Staff is always friendly!",

To be fair, the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations, and the waitresses now wear traditional Thai attire, which is very cool.   But the food portions are MUCH smaller, and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit, as well. (perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations?) The Thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee, and nutrasweet. The spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside, and the chicken soup was VERY salty, which is a complaint that I rarely ever have, seeing as how I'm a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to TOAST. (I shit you, not.) The Pad See Ew and Pad Prik King were both TINY.  No, seriously....both were itty-bitty, teensy-weensy portions....maybe a cup worth of food per entree, at most. And honestly, the food just doesn't seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be. It was just kind of bland.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed, because this place used to be SO good! Luckily we found Thai Grill on N. Decatur, which is even better than the old Pin Kaow (which is saying a lot, because boy did Pin Kaow ever used to be good!).",

Complaints:             service is normally very good except getting the check (ask for it early)           Spicy level I think changes depends on the cook (we like a little spicy but not too much). #2 was more like a #4 once. Kids couldn't eat it.   That being said, I've never had to send food back or a complaint about cleanliness. That's hard to say these days.   From the outside it looks like a dump. I like that because they're often busy.",

Pin Kaow has some decent tasting food, but my biggest problem is that I feel like the portion sizes are getting smaller, and it is just not worth the price.",

This will be the Thai place in Las Vegas I regular at. So glad to have been turned onto them!!  I do recognize it's popularity. And will expect to wait a tad sometimes for a table. Looks like a Take-Out pick up counter (which is off to the right towards the back) does a brisk business!  Only 4 Stars?  Too many Cell Phones! What is with this town? (But I digress)  Perfect.... Service. Decor. Portions. Price. Spice. And they Bless you on your departing. I guess thats what it is. Hands together and they bow to you graciously. Very kind gesture.  The pending \"ring of fire\" I'm sure is so worth it following each visit here. Yes I like it spicy.  11am - 10pm everyday.  Check it out.",

The decor isn't quite as nice, but who really cares.  I had excellent spring rolls and green curry with tofu.  Just spicy enough and very flavorful.  Very good service also.  Unfortunately, not everyone was as pleased with the restaurant as I was!  This weird lady at the table next to me, eating alone, just had to inform the server that the soup was \"nice, but it's not worth 5 dollars\".  Then, when the server tried to take something, she said, \"Leave that please!\"  I then heard her mumble, \"Get away from me!  Just get away!\".  I don't know what her deal was, but Pin Kaow is not the kind of place that should cause a traumatic dining experience like this!",

For those who have a sensitivity to fragrances you will be immediately hit by strong incense the moment you open the door.  If you have an issue with scented products I would advise you don't eat at this restaurant, do take out instead, they will bring it to you outside if you ask.

I love the beef thai salad it's my favorite and the best I've had . They have a pretty big menu for those who like to taste different stuff. I'm a wimp so I normally get like a 3 spice hahaha had 9 before big mistake it sets my mouth on fire be careful with the spice I recommend going with a low spice and just asking for a spice rack!

The spice and flavor was just perfect for a Squid Pad Thai.  YUM!  I loved the decor in this place.  The beautiful woodwork really gave this place an authentic feel.    The prices were also very good.  If I am in the mood for Thai in Vegas, I am definitely coming back here.",

I ordered the red curry that ended up being sweet milk and my wife ordered chili mint noodles (their version of drunken noodles) which was basically sweet fried tofu with barely any mint or chili.  We have tasted wonderful food in NYC, San Diego, Dallas and even Little Rock Arkansas and this was by far the worst Thai food we've had. As a vegetarian I would rate this pretty low.",

I was off Thai food for a while until my friend had me go to Le Thai and reminded me as why I loved it. this place is pretty much as good as Le Thai but I do feel like I get more food at Le Thai.

I tasted my friend's yellow curry, and it was generic with sweetness and no real character or authentic flavor.  The crab rangoon was pretty good, very sweet and fried well.  However, I've had much better Thai food at numerous places in Las Vegas. Prommares kills this place, and even though Thai Grill isn't as good as it used to be, it is still better than Pin-Kaow and is just down the street on Lake Mead and Decatur.    We had to wait 15 minutes outside before we were seated, and we were only seated after we went *back* into the establishment, asked for tables again, and split up our rather large party of 8 people.  The place was packed... with non-asians.  This doesn't always mean anything, but after tasting real authentic Thai food for years at Thai Grill when it was good, I can safely say that the food at Pin Koaw is geared towards Americans who probably don't know the difference.",

But there are few foods that have the affect on me that Thai red curry chicken has. It is has a soothing affect on me that I can't quite explain. If I even so much as walk by a place serving curry I am drawn in by the intoxicating aroma. It is as if a ghostly hand is beckoning me like a cartoon bear. It may just be my favorite food. And the red curry chicken from Pin Kaow is no exception. It was sweet and creamy with tender chicken, sliced bamboo, red bell pepper, and fresh basil. Served on some white rice and I am set. I ordered the spring rolls to get me started. They were fresh and hot burning my hands and mouth. Pure crispy deliciousness.  The service was good too. The staff is courteous even bringing me extra rice when I asked for my remaining curry to go. The decor is pleasing as well. Dark wood paneling, Thai art and tapestries, and Thai music all add to the ambience. I can't believe I have passed by it so many times when I live so close. This is a place I will be back to hopefully in the near future.",

Their spice scale is about the same as other Thai restaurants I've experienced --an 8 is sufficiently spicy, but not unbearable.  I love the ambience in here. Dimly lit, nicely decorated and quiet. The service isn't exceptionally noteworthy, but it's -- in my experience -- at least as good as any other Thai restaurant in town.",

So imagine my surprise when looking for a place to have dinner with out of town friends, that we pulled into a parking spot in front of Pin Kaow and walked through the doors and were transported into a beautifully elegant, dining experience.  Not only is the restaurant beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive, dressed in Thai attire.  And the food... OH!  The food.  It's wonderfully delicious!  My party and I had assorted curries and appetizers and nothing disappointed.  My San Diego friend, who is very finicky, LOVED his duck curry and had it again when we returned 3 months later.

People have told me that they prefer Archie's, but I thought it was terrible. Pin Kaow is pretty consistent and with all of the remodeling the decor is nice. I use Pin Kaow as a standard to compare all other Thai places to, and I have never found one that I like as much, not even in other cities. I recommend the shrimp rolls, Tom Ka Koong soup, and the Pad Woon Sen. Oh, and of course the Thai tea.",

They let you choose the fire level of your dish -- but honestly, if you're a person who likes spice, ask them to make it \"Thai spicy\" instead of saying 9 or 10.  You'll get the right stuff.  They're very prompt with your order and you can pick up in generally 10 minutes.  The ambience in the restaurant lends itself to either groups or perhaps a date night.

Their spice levels are kind of weak (however, I find that a 3 at one Thai restaurant is a 7 at another...for here, a 5 seems to be a 1), so if you want a kick go higher than you would elsewhere.  My favorite here is the Chili Mint Noodles and then sticky rice with coconut sauce for dessert.  I've tried several other menu options, which for the most part were all very flavorful but it was about texture for me.  Their dicing and chopping tends to be chunkier than other Thai spots I've hit and I'd prefer smaller bits, but that's just me.  Food is always fresh and hot when we pick it up, and on time.",

The flavor is what we are used to and we usually get the same entrees which include. Tom Yum soup with shrimp, Pad woo sen,  Beef basil, Pork Larb, Thai beef salad, and spring rolls. We've ordered other entrees, but these are the ones that we usually include in our order. We get it at spicy level 7, sometimes a 5 for my daughter. The spice level is usually what we can count on to be pretty consistent. Since my husband has been to Thailand a few times, he knows what Thai hot is, and most restaurants don't usually serve it that way for us Americans. I am sure a level 7 would be much hotter in Thailand. But we rather enjoy the food than be sweating it out and having a runny nose from the heat! Plus our insides would thank us!  This past visit though, the spice levels got mixed up somehow. The Tom Yum soup was not spicy at all. Hubby had to add more of the base that we keep in the fridge at home for when he makes his own. And the rest of the entrees seemed to be at a level 5, except for the larb which my daughter eats, seemed to be spicier. Not sure if they have a new cook, but its been months since we've been able to order from here. The flavors are still there, just the spice level was off.   I love how they get the beef so ground up in the Beef basil. Other restaurants use thin slices of beef, which I like too, but I like the ground better somehow.",

The portions are big, but not feast size, so I usually share when I'm mildly hungry but could eat the whole thing if I were starving. The interior is dimly lit and very ornate. You can come casual, but I'd go for a nicer casual. The wait isn't that long for the food, and the staff is nice. You also get to chose the spicy level between 1-10. I usually go for a 5 and it's not too bad (:",

The soup was smooth, and coconut milk creamy with a light undertone of lemon grass.  The mushrooms in the soup were fresh and plentiful, along with the shrimp.  I loved the thin crispy, yet tender chicken slices in the Pad Thai. The rice noodles had a nice balance of sweet and sour, and were very light.  I was altogether impressed with the service over the phone (since I called back, and changed my item selection after I already place an order for mango sticky rice).  Also, I was glad to see that they included utensils and napkins, thus saving me from washing additional dishes. If you like a light (non-greasy or overbearing), and fresh Thai flavor this is the place to go.  I will most definitely order from here again.",

The Thai Beef Salad jus didn't have that flavorful taste (I should have got the Papaya Salad instead, I think maybe that would have been way better)....Yellow Curry w/Chicken was ok & Red Curry w/Shrimp was really good...Fried Rice w/Chicken was Amazingly Great...Tom Yum Koong Hot Pot was way too bland...My Husband loved the Pad Thai w/Pork...& Thai BBQ Chicken was ok, Sweet & Sour Pork was ok...the appetizer #2 was delicious, Rice Soup didn't like.  I would go back for maybe a quick lunch for the Green Curry & Try there Papaya Salad.  I was a bit disappointed...but now I know I won't go there forking up $159 for dinner again.",

Now I will ONLY go here after my friend took me here a few months ago! I have already been 5 times in the last 2 months and just celebrated my birthday there. Not only was the food stellar but was serenaded \"Happy Birthday\" and \"Love me Tender\" haha by the WONDERFUL new manager Toy. Everytime I have been there he walks around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal. He is always happy, smiling, and truly LOVES his job. It is awesome to see such pride in the restaurant and concern for his customers. The food is ALWAYS so damn good!! Flavorful and fresh. My faves are definitely the crab rangoon, garlic tofu, pad thai, pad see ewe, and I swear I cannot figure out if they buy it or make it but the coconut ice cream is THE BEST I have ever had! Real shreds of coconut and even got a free scoop with a candle and a cherry on my bday! The ONLY reason I am taking off one star is because I feel like the portion size is sometimes a little inconsistent. I feel like the portion sizes are always larger for lunch than dinner. Regardless, this is my new thai place..sorry weera :( I'm sorry I didn't try this place much much sooner!!",

    "text": "I just moved to Las Vegas with my girlfriend. We decided to get some takeout from Pin Kaow based on a glowing recommendation.  I regret that I cannot echo this recommendation. The woman who took our order looked annoyed at our very presence. I asked her a few friendly questions about takeout, delivery, and some menu options. She seemed exasperated and simultaneously bored. I didn't even know a person could experience that blend of emotions. Thank you, Pin Kaow, for a lesson in the breadth of the human experience.   I asked her how long delivery would take and she replied 2 hours. I wish that were an exaggeration. Needless to say, we ordered takeout instead and waited around for 20 minutes.   Here's what we ordered: - Fresh Spring Rolls. - Chicken Pad Thai, with a 7 on the spicy meter. - Pad Woon Sen, with a 5 on the spicy meter.  And here's what my takeout boxes contained: - Fried Egg Rolls (seriously...?) - Chicken Pad Thai, with a 1 on the spicy meter. - Pad Woon Sen, with a 3 on the spicy meter.  The food was decent but unimpressive, especially for the price ($29 after tip). The egg rolls were a little rubbery, like they came out of a microwave... and I didn't even ORDER egg rolls.  The pad thai was yummy, but when you're really hungry, everything tastes good. It lacked a certain richness of flavor I have come to expect from pad thai dishes.   My girlfriend's pad woon sen was good. No qualms there, aside from the spicyness not being correct. I would have given them a free pass on this since there is a degree of subjectivity, but it wasn't even close.  I read on the menu that there are three different Pin Kaow locations. I am willing to give the other locations a chance, but I will not be visiting this specific Pin Kaow again.",

However, the real issue is they should have been much more accommodating to any customer, especially a regular customer. Instead they unnecessarily turned down business. I went to Gaati Thai restaurant right after and they were much more accommodating and have much better food. They also close at 10pm and even though I got there at 9:45, they still set up a table and did not rush the meal at all.   I will never go back to Pin Kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family. That is thousands of dollars lost for their lack of customer service and decency.",

    "text": "VERDICT: Some food is done very well.  You have to know what to order or you'll be sorry.  Let me start by saying what I don't like at Pin Kaow.  Their curry is not very good.  I don't know what flavor it is that sets me off, but it reminds me of uncooked flour.  I actually can't stand the flavor.  The other thing at Pin Kaow that is horrible is their chicken.  I don't know if they age their chicken before serving it or what.  Their chicken has a strange texture and is quite flavorless, unless, of course, you love the flavor of uncooked flour.  Authentic?  I hope not Now let's talk about what is good.  Their Thai beef jerky is addicting to the Nth degree.  If you've never had Thai beef jerky, you must try it.  It is one of the best foods in the world.  They take strips of beef and dry them and then, the best part, they deep fry them.  It's served with a sweet and spicy sauce.  It's truly a mouth orgasm that you have to experience.  The other item that I recommend is the Tom Ka Koon, a delicious spicy soup made with coconut milk and shrimp.  The Tom Ka at Pin Kaow has an amazing complex flavor that only comes with good Thai food.  It's another must try.  That's it.  That's all I ever get and all I ever need to get.  As far as I'm concerned, Pin Kaow should change its name to Thai Beef Jerky and Tom Ka Koon store.  Delicious!",

    "text": "This was my third choice after Lotus had an hour wait and Chada is closed for the week.   I ordered the vegetable panang curry and chicken mint noodles. I asked the waitress how much it would be to substitute the brown rice for the white rice that comes with the panang curry and she said it was the same price as the side order. This made no sense so I asked the \"manager\" about the policy and all she said was yes brown rice 3 dollars. If you are a manager of a establishment where your customers are primarily American you need to know how to communicate in English. After having my first bite of the panang curry I could tell Pin Kaow serves Americanized Thai food. I should have known when I walked in and did not see once person of Asian decent. Back to the panang curry; it tasted like I was having straight up butter with minimal spice on top of my rice. The mint noodles tasted good but also overly sweet to appeal to the American customer. The noodles sat on a bed of wilted romaine lettuce which made the dish unappealing. The only plus is that they serve brown rice but I will not be back because the manager cannot explain the policies and the food is one dimensional and completely Americanized.",

    "text": "I frequent this place when I'm in the mood for thai. It's on my way home from work so I call it in as im leaving and it's always ready for pickup when I get there. The last visit I ordered the panang curry level 5, chicken pad thai and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons are my favorite they were crispy with lots of delicious filling (just cream cheese and scallion) and they come with a sweet dipping sauce. I ate those puppies in the car omw home lol. Anyways total for everything came to about $35. It was a bit pricey for just one person but I figured I would make at least 2/3 meals out of everything so when u break it down its not bad at all.  I was disappointed with the pad thai it didn't have very much flavor. The panang curry was good and the spice level was just right. You can get it spiced from 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest. I don't know how some people get a 10! I have also had the yellow curry chicken from there and I really enjoyed that. It comes with chunks of potatoes and carrots and I think bamboo but maybe u have to request that I can't remember. I have never dined in but the restaurant looks clean. The cashier who does the to-go could probably use a smile but that won't keep me from coming back.",

I have 6 or 7 Thai dishes that I eat regularly and several more that I eat when I want to change things up, and in every case I can think of somewhere else I'd rather go...it's weird, but True.

The restaurant has a nice, dimly lit atmosphere and you're greeted as soon as you walk in. Bathrooms are kind of awkwardly placed right as you enter...but I mean...who cares I guess. So far, I have tried the chicken pad thai, pad see ew, green curry, and crab rangoon.   The food is good. I've had a hard time finding Thai food in Vegas that isn't overly salted, and overly saucy. The only issue I had was they really seemed to struggle with the spice level. I asked for a high level of spice, but really it barely had any spice. This is a big no no for me because I like my thai food SPICY. Either way, I would likely return, because it's a nice atmosphere and the food was good overall.",

Practically anything with coconut milk in it is a win for me.  Definitely hits he spot if you're looking for big portions. Plate sizes are good for sharing with a group as well.",

So I did what any sensible person would do and called up to place a pick up order.   The staff was very professional when I asked about gluten free options which is a double bonus and deserving of a gold star ! They took down my info, the order was ready when the promised, and very warm fresh off the wok !   I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my mom wanted the spicy basil chicken gluten free style. The spicy levels are one to ten. We were both very happy with the size and quality of our to go order !",

The ambience is cozy and sort of romantic, good for a date or family dinner. The service was also good. They were nice and attentive. I had papaya salad, tom yum soup, chicken pad prik king and shrimp pad thai. I got spice level 6 for all of them and it's pretty mild; some didn't taste spicy at all. Besides the pad thai being a little too sweet, the rest of the food was pretty decent, definitely above average but not the best Thai food I've had.",

    "text": "Thai food is one cuisine that I never get tired of and Vegas has lots of spots to go to when nothing else sounds good.  This Pin Kaow has been a mainstay in my rotation since I used to live close by for years, even before I started Yelping.   It may not look like much on the outside since the restaurant is in a non-descript shopping plaza on the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow.  Once you enter, though, you will find yourselves in an inviting atmosphere with wooden walls and accents throughout, as well as Thai decor.  It does get busy at night, but I've been lucky enough to not have had to wait for a table yet, usually arriving around 6:00pm.   My favorites are their Mango Salad with fried tofu, cilantro, cashews, red onions, and Thai lime sauce.  This is a refreshing dish that helps you cool off in the summer time.  I also like their Pad Thai as well as their Satay, either the beef or the chicken.  Service is attentive and the food is always satisfying.  Even though I no longer live near this location, I'd still make the drive to eat here.",

I did a little research and found this restaurant had good reviews and was pretty close to me so I gave it a shot. I'm really glad that I did because it was great! The staff was very friendly over the phone and in person when I picked up my order. The food was exactly what I was looking for! This will definitely be my new go to for my Thai fix :)",

The papaya salad had soggy tomatoes and literally a 1 on the 10 spicy scale, although I asked for highest level.  Side of fried tofu was fine but tasted of nothing.  And with no spice on the papaya salad dressing, there was nothing to soak the tofu.  The red curry was more of a soup with some chili oil added in for spice.  No coconut whatsoever, making it extremely un-Thai.  Takeout service took 30 minutes although 20 was the estimation, so I was left sitting there.  Then, my food sat waiting for another 5 minutes as the lady stayed on the phone instead of taking a brief hold to hand me my food.  Nothing noteworthy of the dining experience.  Catering to the most bland of Thai food with all easy and mild flavoring, nothing to overpower.  $25 not well spent.",

Food: we tried the chef special house Thai wings, papaya salad (a favorite of mine), and shared chicken pad Thai to compare to our favorite back home. ALL plates were wiped clean to say the least! I loved the crunch and sauce on the wings and the pad Thai had  great sauce and flavor. The papaya salad was spiced perfectly and super fresh and delicious.  We had hot sake for only $8 and it kept is warm on a chilly night!  We know where to come back for prime time Thai!",

    "text": "Unfortunately I don't feel that the reviews that I read of recent lived up to my experience tonight. Pin Kaow has a nice atmosphere when you walk inside, but being seated is another story. That seemed to be something more of a, \"is there someone who will help me?\" situation.  It wasn't particularly busy on a Monday night, but by the speed of the service you'd have thought otherwise. Our server didn't understand our order of edamame and two chicken Pad Thais originally so we went over it in detail again. Not that big of a deal, but the edamame took over twenty minutes to reach the table.   In the mean time the table to the right of us mentioned their calamari being too fishy and asked for spring rolls to substitute. That was receive before any of our order and the table to the left had an issue with the size of the soup they ordered (they wanted two bowls, not two cups). It took around 45 minutes to receive the order of Pad Thai which was just okay.  Afterwards I did not feel well and without sharing too much information, would not recommend this restaurant. There's a decent amount that could be said about the service, but I don't want to put it all on our waitress. So in the end I feel like it was a 1-2 star experience and I don't see myself coming back.",

    "text": "Ahh Pin Kaow. Now I have been going to Pin Kaow for years and the customer service has always been a hit and miss.  The food though always satisfactory.  We visited Friday night with the wonton soup hotpot in mind....because I had been sick I thought that the soup would be good for my sore throat.  We did call ahead.  Alway recommended because this place gets busy.  It always seems to have people waiting outside on the weekends.  When we got there we were seated almost immediately even though alot of people were waiting-thats why I recommend the call ahead.  We ordered the wonton soup hot pot.  If you havent had the hot pot before it is a pot with a hole in the middle where they light a running flame.  I would say its for two people but probably could feed four.  The first time I had this I was so impressed.  It just sets an ambiance...an experience.  You definitely must try it.  For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Probably the best I have ever had that I order it everytime I come here.  I order the spicy at an 8 or 9 and never seems too spicy to eat.  Especially if my BF can eat it.  He ordered the mongolian beef.  It is always great too.  It is different from other mongolian beefs I have had....the sauce is more like a gravy consistency.  But it is good.  All paired off with a glass of chardonney and the night was bliss.   This is a great place for a date, for a group, for a celebration.  It is a Thai experience.  So if you are trying to impress someone it would be a good spot to take them.  Like I said the service is hit and miss.  I do recommend the take out.  They have a little section in the back where they do the to-go orders and I have never had a problem.  In and out.  Food is just as good as eating in.  This place isnt very close to home but I will drive for the occasional Thai fix! ;)",

We had the potstickers and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce for our starters. Both were good, but the satay stole the show! Pin kaow marinades their chicken in coconut milk before grilling it which makes it tender and delicious. The peanut sauce is sweet and goes perfect with the savory chicken. Overall, a huge hit. For our main course we had the yellow curry and chili mint noodles. Both were great and the curry is my favorite thing on the menu. The yellow curry is creamy and sweet and spivey. The only negative the the meal was the tomatoes in the chili mint noodles. I don't think they belong in Thai food and I always pick them out; tonight was no different. Overall, it was a great night, great food and great company!  Ps. Service was fast and perfect!",

It's a nice change from what you're accustomed to having delivered (Pizza, Chinese, etc.)  The food here is pretty good, but I don't think it's GREAT. I've had better Thai food around town.

The dish seemed large but it contained lots of sauce, marginal amounts of white meat chicken and potatoes with a yellow coconut curry sauce. It tasted good with the exception of the $9.00 price I would think their portions would be larger for the high price.   Another item that urked me was that I ordered hot tea and received my billd they charged me .50 higher then the menu said. I brought this up to the waitress and she said she would mention it to the owner. On top of that they charge a $15.00 minimum on credit cards so I had to pay cash.  The waitress didn't brother bringing my change back so I walked out - her tip was the change she didn't return.  I'd recommending sticking to the lunch specials because your paying for the decor here - overpriced and small portions, at least for the Chicken Curry.",

I got home and noticed there was barely any meat or veggies in the yellow curry, it probably didn't even fill up half of the container it came it. The tom yum soup was very watered down. It barely had any taste to it and was almost clear with some dry pieces of chicken, a few tomatoes, and mushrooms floating on top.

We would definitely come back.",

When I asked for an additional rice, they said it would be $5.00. Seriously? Five bucks for literally a half cup of rice? I just went home and made my own rice in my own rice cooker.   I've been going here for years and it seems that lately the service has been lacking. When I pay $30 for dinner, I shouldn't have to go home and make my own rice.   Also, it just seems silly to skimp on rice. A portion of white rice costs about 30 cents. So they're saving 30 cents, but they've lost my business. There are plenty of other Thai places in the area.",

My only complaint is that their spicy ratings are weak sauce.  But the delicious garlic spicy sauce on the table will remedy that.    Service is prompt, friendly, and efficient.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with beautiful decor.  Nice date spot too, not noisy at all.  And if you're fortunate enough to live near by, they deliver.  Always arrives much sooner than they estimate over the phone.",

The prices may be slightly higher than other Thai places, but you're paying for consistent quality across the menu and way better ambiance than the competitors, full of wood paneling, Asian screens, and mood lighting. Good place to take out a visitor that's relaxed but not too casual (dumpy) (I'm talking about Mix Zone).  One thing I love/hate about Pin Kaow on Rainbow is that I always run into a random from my past. Like old friends' moms.",

But, it's True that only about 7 miles from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip exists a wonderful oasis of Thai food with quiet, casual ambiance.   I found myself really enjoying the peace and serenity of the Pin Kaow food. We had the Red Curry and the Pad Thai which come on a 1-10 scale v the traditional 1-4 or 1-5. I would recommend ordering higher than normal unless you want bland food. The Pad Thai is a toolkit v a completed dish. The nuts come on the side v being cooked into the dish. I found this odd. Understandably, people have food allergies, but usually the question can be asked if the server feels the diner may be unable to read. Whateva, I assembled the Pad Thai.   The curry was a winner, solid 5 star. I will absolutely be back to the wonderful little establishment. (Apparently, there are now 3!) BTW, get here early as it gets packed!",

Vegitable spring rolls for an appetizer (delish!) and it was a close tie between garlic chicken or pad thai.. Pad thai won the decision by a nose.    I ordered a level 4 spice but I think the young Miss taking my order skipped that bit of information because my dish lacked spice completely.  This could have been a total taste-bud disaster but luckily the noodles were flavored to perfection, spice-less and all.  All in all the service was super and the eats were delish.

The green curry isn't even green! It's cream colored. Maybe she misheard me and thought I ordered a cream curry?! I ordered a heat level 9 and didn't feel any heat whatsoever, let alone break a sweat or get a runny nose; did they not believe I could handle the heat? Or maybe she misheard me again and thought I said five? Also, curries come with plain rice; if you want sticky rice, specify that you want that instead of plain rice; otherwise, you get both, which is a waste.   The service was ok.   I might go back for a soup or other non-curry dish, but for now, based on my non-green too-creamy curry, I can't go higher than \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I've actually made better green curry!   This place is close to where I live, but I think I'll travel down to Sahara unless pressed for time to a more modest but more authentic place to get my Thai curry fix.  The gas money will be covered and then some in the price difference as well.",

My hubby read the great reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. We got the Masaman and Pad thai, both with Tofu. The Masaman was okay, nice curry flavor, definitely could have gotten it more spicy (6 was too low) especially because it was a fairly sweet (as in taste) dish. The pad thai I thought was disappointing because it was VERY greasy/oily. There was a film all over the plate and you couldn't eat the noodles without getting the oil/grease everywhere. The serve was excellent though. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The thai iced coffee and tea were both good. I just think I'm still on the prowl for my favorite Vegas Thai place.....there was a place I liked when I lived here years ago...I'm going to try to hunt it down!!",

They suggest the most expensive dishes on the menu, and if you make the mistake that I did of ordering them, they are terrible, and I mean terrible.  I'm still giving them a 4 because I should know better, and their food if you stick to regular thai food is good.",

    "text": "Used to be a really good Thai restaurant but after its expansion several months ago the quality has declined dramatically. I ordered takeout from them this week and had to wait 40 minutes after the time they said the food would be ready. There were a lot of people waiting for food and while I was waiting I heard several complaints from diners who received the wrong food.  Anyway once I got home with the food we found that the shrimp in the shrimp salad had not been cooked properly, the beef satay was extremely rare and the shrimp cakes were cold/uncooked. After calling to complain they said they would reverse the charge on my credit card. My suggestion is to wait several months until their kitchen hopefully expands to accommodate the orders from the larger restaurant.",
