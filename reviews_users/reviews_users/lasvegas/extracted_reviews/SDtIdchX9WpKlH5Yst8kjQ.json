The man who cooked our food came out and asked us how the food was which I thought was awesome. He also brought us Finadene sauce and was super nice. The woman working there gave my 1 year old son red rice and some shrimp chips. Definitely felt like we were at home here. The Red Rice Musubi was soooo good and the Hafa Adai plate is seriously to die for. Can't wait to come back!",

They even had the big glass containers of pickled goodies reminiscent of the ones sold at the mom & pop stores on Guam.  Loved their red rice and sweet tatiyas!  The only thing that was missing from the menu that I was REALLY craving for was tinala katne but that still didn't sway my opinion! I will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!

The whole class also got 15% off coupons.  They were also very kind about discussing the culture of their islands and the connection with the food.  I am so appreciative that they took the time during their day off to hang out with the class.  They have encouraged my students to be more proactive with the community and use their writing skills to communicate.  Mahalo nui loa!  Mrs heksch!",

We need a place like this in San Diego. Definitely will be back.  If they keep it authentic and no short cuts they are going to do awesome ! They've got lots of goodies that you can't get any where unless you make it yourself! I just noticed a picture that reads chicken kelaguen was boiled ! That to me is a big no no ... you gotta grill it... and definitely have fresh coconut ... The chicken kelaguen we had was grilled for sure .. However,  it didnt have coconut in it ...that is the one thing I may comment on, however grilling the chicken and the right amount of lime flavor made it pass. Keep it all authentic as possible and your going to boom! If im not mistaken Red Rice is the only chamorro restaurant in Las Vegas..so that is a serious plus for them =)",

My sister treated me here since I haven't tried it yet ( she has tried it a couple times already). I ordered a fiesta plate and a melon drink.   It was very good. I'm impressed. The portions are generous and the red rice is delicious. Granted to the average patron they probably won't understand why anyone would get excited about it, but people who are raised/born in Guam will get it. The shrimp patty was so and so. It didn't have very much shrimp, still it was tasty. BBQ was delicious and not overcook.   Price wise it is on the high side. You will easily spend  $15.00 for a meal and a drink. Will be back for sure. Still haven't tried their empanadas and that is one of my favorite food back home.",

It seemed like the lady who told us that \"someone will be right with you,\" didn't even acknowledge or tend to look for him as we were both starving. :/ I ordered the tamales and the red rice musubi. At first, I thought the tamales we're going to be huge and not these two SMALL foiled wrapped pieces of a mushy texture. I was trying to picture shredded beef with some spices (along the lines of a Mexican tamale). It was not my favorite nor I didn't even bother finishing the other piece. It looked like baby food to me. The red rice musubi had great flavor, which I liked. My friend's beef combo plate was not bad, just your normal bbq plate with a small side cucumber salad. We both liked the red rice tho. Overall, the food was just average. Time management needs improvement. The wait time for the food took a while. I understand they're still brand new. Maybe I will give them another try if I'm ever on that side of town.",

If you don't know what musubi is, I'll give you quick lesson. It's a handmade, handheld dish made of rice (usually calrose/sticky white rice) and Spam (canned meat/luncheon meat) wrapped in seaweed (the greenish black stuff sushi is wrapped in.) It's the perfect snack, appetizer, home lunch for work or school trips, or if you need a quick bite while on the go. You get the idea. This is a favorite among the Pacific islander culture.  The Red Rice Musubi is made with luncheon meat (not the Spam brand, if you know Spam you can tell the difference). The luncheon meat was tasty, not salty. I've had homemade authentic red rice (I have family from Saipan) and this red rice is legit. Full of bold flavors. It's not spicy.   If you love bold flavors and feeling adventurous, I highly recommend the Red Rice Musubi!  The musubi also has a mayo-like sauce in between the rice and meat. This is now my favorite musubi and the sauce is what stood out compared to the Hawai'ian style musubi.   If you're looking to taste Chamorro food without getting a full size take out plate, this is the way to go. It's about $2-3 bucks. It's well worth it. Red rice is a rice dish that is uniquely Chamorro, you won't find it any other Asian or Pacific Islander restaurant.",

Definitely enjoyed the familiar flavors, especially when we were having it with a few of my friends from back home (Guam) at our 20th high school reunion.  As always, good or bad, Guam food is always comfort food to me. Red Rice was sort of in the middle of the pack for me.  Hubby got the chicken plate while I went full throttle and got the Fiesta Plate.  Favorite things on the plate:  grilled chicken and bbq beef.  Kelaguen was ok (mine's better) and the shrimp patty was kind of mushy in the middle.  I saved my rib for last but it was just too tough for me...lotsa gnawing! I would have liked the rice slightly more al dente (but it wasn't mushy).  We did nosh on the empanada - one of my fave foods from home - and ended up taking four of them to go.  Although I ate them later that day cold, they really are best when super hot.  This was good...otherwise, home-cooked Guam food is always best.",

The only thing that I wasnt impressed by was the shrimp patties were so small and some what burnt! If it was Guam, those things would be as big as your palm. The empanada was also disappointing because it was also burnt and there was very little filling! Guam being way more expensive than Las Vegas, If you ordered these plates on Guam, they would only cost $10! These plates are too high priced for 1 rib, slices of chicken, keleguen and the small shrimp patties and empanada!",

The food is pricey too. The rice was ok but didn't have much flavor. The chicken was the only thing I liked although it wasn't anything special. It tasted like something you would grill yourself. The lumpia was bland, and the empanada wasn't that great with mushy meat or something inside. I don't remember the name of the other item, but it was chopped up chicken into tiny tiny bits with way too much vinegar. I didn't care for it. The rib had a weird teriyaki flavor & didn't care for it either. The woman in the front was friendly but too busy multitasking by taking orders & preparing food, making people wait a long time to order.",

The decor is reminiscent of the restaurants and eateries I remember sitting in as a child, the sounds of reggae music fill the room, pictures of Guam flash on the TV screens and warm friendly familiar smiles are everywhere you look. Nostalgia, check!  I never really order anything in particular because I crave different foods each time. My favorites are the empanada, titiyas, shrimp patties, BBQ chicken, and the pickled goods (in jars on the counter). My kids love the red rice masubi, and bagged fried shrimp chips. And, of course there's also the scrumptious desserts. Amazing food, check!  You really can't go wrong with anything you try here. So, whether you're craving a taste of home, want to try something new, or want a warm \"home cooked meal\" - Red Rice most definitely can check all those boxes. It's definitely a must - you won't be disappointed, that's for sure!!!",

The girl that took our order didn't have the best customer service... seemed like there were a lot of islanders in there and she had no islander love. Come on be excited!

The BBQ beef was extra chewy, stringy, and on  the dry side.  The pork spare rib was lacking in flavor, same with the chicken kelaguen.   The last Chamorro place we had in vegas closed down and was much tastier than this one. This place doesn't even come close to the Chamorro restaurants I've tried in San Diego.   Also, this place is called Red Rice. I would think that the red rice would be Bomb dot com... But it was another disappointment. Maybe they should've named this place BBQ chicken instead because that was the star of the whole plate.",

I've tried some of the food before and know a little about it and it's always good food from the heart.   It was odd having a chicken thigh since I'm used to leaner meats like the breast. We had the chicken plate that came with red rice, kelaguen, and salad. In addition we ordered empanadas, shrimp patties and shrimp kelaguen. For I believe $1 or $2 more you can add the corn tortilla or tatiya which I think should come with it since eating just the kelaguen on its own is quite different. But things cost, and it's just a few more dollars, no big deal.   The patties remind me of a friend who makes them and it's pretty much spot on. The empanadas were fresh and made to order which is always good.   For $26 we were pretty full after. Reading other reviews, It really wasn't that expensive as I thought. I believe it was well priced for the amount of food given.   The gentleman who worked behind the counter came and checked on us and gave us some pointers and things to do while in Guam.   Missing one star for location and ease of finding the place. From the street it's hard to see an unlit banner.   Thanks Red Rice!",

It was more like shrimp tempura and less like popcorn shrimp.  Loved the canned milk teas.  It's a bit on the pricey side considering the amount but still very reasonable.  Will come back!",

They were laughing and smiling and had this aura like they were completely genuine about how much they like you.   All that aside, the food was amazing! My stepdad is Guamanian and I've had the food before so I knew what to expect but if you haven't you need to try everything. Like a platter of everything. Because everything was good. I HAVE TO SAY THIS; the food is completely made fresh, all of it so you realize you'll be waiting for almost as long as you would for restaurant food even though it's more convenient ordering situation and the food is worth the wait. All of it.   And after all of that they gave us some mochi donuts and I've never in my life heard of them but OMG they're mochi dough with coconut in them fried to perfection you have to get them. They aren't too sweet and we devoured them.",

    "text": "If there was an option, I would have given 2.5 stars. But the reason I chose 2 instead of 3 is because their selection of Assam teas, lemon tea and the customer service was good. They were welcoming and gave off a Guam vibe.    We ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to \"cook\" but it was just warm food.   The red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat.   Overall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!    If they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience! The restaurant has a lot of potential and I'd be willing to give this place another chance.",

If you're from Guam and looking for that home flavor or just interested in the cuisine, give Red Rice a visit. Having everything cooked to order is worth the wait in my opinion. I can only recall one other  Chamoru restaurant in Las Vegas which closed a long time ago, but if Red Rice was open at the same time, they would have closed a lot sooner.  I was told the Tamales Gisu will only be available in a catering platter after their last run was done when I visited last week. But that's OK because I could probably eat half that platter to myself.",

Even though we both feel like we have pretty expansive international palates, I am sometimes hesitant to try new ethnic cuisine in case the spice is off, but it was late and we were hungry, so I gave it a shot.   We had no idea what to order, so I went with the most popular items: hafa adai plate for him and the locals plate for me. When I ordered over the phone, I also asked for recommendations. The guy was so nice and understanding and didn't critique my pronunciations. Ha! He suggested the coconut titiya and the custard cake for dessert, so we added that to the order as well.   Everything was boxed and ready to go when I got there 15 minutes later. I rushed home to try it all out and was not disappointed! Everything was amazing! I loved the barbecue chicken and the chicken kelaguen the most as far as main dishes go. The cucumber salad on the side balances all the flavors, and the red rice was delicious! But, you guys, the coconut titiya!!! I'm a carboholic, so it's no surprise I loved it so much. I could eat it with every single meal, I am sure. It paired very well with the chicken kelaguen. The shrimp cakes were good, and the empanada was awesome (I had to sneak a few bites to try it out). We had the cake a few hours later for dessert, and it didn't disappoint.   Now, my guy and I are extremely picky and hard to please foodies at times. We were both blown away by how much we loved the food we got at Red Rice. He has a sensitive stomach, and a lot of barbecued foods are so greasy that they don't sit well. Not the case at Red Rice! We both felt happy and satisfied afterward.   We ate here two days ago and yesterday my SO asked, \"How far away is that place again? It's not super close to where we live, is it?\" My response, \"It's close enough. I will drive there anytime!\" A 17-minute drive is nothing for delicious food like this!",

Today my family and I got two orders of the Hafa Adai plate, an order of empanadas, titiyas, chicken kelaguen and pickled papaya. Everything was so good. The rib was tender, chicken barbecue flavorful, titiyas are made fresh and sooo good I could eat it everyday but then I'd be 500lbs. And they don't try to cheat you on the empanadas. They are FAT!

Let me say this first, Chamorro food is very underrated. If you haven't tried it, you need to go. I had the Boka plate. I was not let down. The red rice was delicious. The BBQ chicken was cooked thoroughly and very flavorful. And the findene...SPOT ON. I felt like I was back on the island eating at the Chamorro festival.   Just like the people of Guam, the customer service was friendly and welcoming. I'm coming back here every time I come to Vegas.   Thank you for such great food and hospitality!",

Ok, so I ordered the \"Nene\" rib plate and it literally came with half a scoop of rice, two of the smallest ribs you have ever seen, and a giant side of potato salad that they put in with the hot food so by the time I got home the potato salad was warm. Gross. The red rice was good but not particularly fresh.   I would give this place another try hopefully it's better next time.",

Definitely the best Guam restaurant in Vegas, yet.  kelaguen (chopped chicken with lemon, onions, peppers, shredded coconut bits)- good amount of heat, tang, and flavor BBQ chicken and ribs- great marinade, properly grilled, moist, not dry Fina'denne'(spicy soy sauce vinegar condiment) nicely made, great flavor with a perfect amount of heat and acidity  Red rice- great texture and flavor, just like home  empanada- filling is so good and spicy but not too spicy for the ones that can't handle much heat, moist and tons of bursting flavor crystals with each bite!  Latiya: love it! Simple and classic. The custard was great, smooth, rich, and not too sweet, the cake was light and moist and does not over power the custard. Perfect amount of cinnamon to spice it up. The best one I've had in a while...   Service is amiable and good.  Thanks Red Rice! Truly captured the essence of the flavors of Guam!   Over all:  Tastes like just like home  I minused 1 star because it takes a while before you get your food, they close at 7pm and not much parking.",

So as a caveat to my dining at Red Rice, y wife's family is Chamorran and I have had some amazing food similar to what is served here. I may be biased to some of the flavors of her family recipes. We got the Fiesta Plate, Empenada and red rice Musubi. The BBQ beef on the plate had decent flavor but not very BBQ from my experience. Short rib was good and chicken tender and full of good flavor. Chicken Keleguen was really close to Josie's family minus the Coconut. (Would not keep well id it had that). Red Rice Musubi was really good had pickled Daikon in middle adding great bold taste and also a little bite that came back on the palate. The Empenada was really good also having a bit of heat to it.   Thank You for dining at Red Rice. We will go back. There was a plaque on the wall that had my wife's family name on it. I'm sure some distant cousin in some way. That is a whole other story. Staff is friendly, food was good. It's not a fancy place but who needs that for a great affordable meal. Please check this place out you will not be sorry.",

If I were in Gwam, I feel like this is what a restaurant would look like!  They actually have a few screens in the dining room which are displaying pictures and videos from Gwam.  The service was friendly and timely!  I actually met one of the owners who came out to the table to check on our meal! (Now that's service folks!)  So, we shared the Fiesta Plate and I absolutely enjoyed it!  This was my first time eating Chicken Kelaguen, it is served cold, and it is tasty!  I love grilled meats of any kind and Red Rice did not let me down.  They had a very steady flow while we were there, and the restaurant handled it just fine!  Bottom line....I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!  Thanks Red Rice for a great meal!",

We tried the lumpia, shrimp patties, pork ribs, BBQ chicken, red rice, cucumber finadene, latiya, sweet coconut titiyas, bonuelos mungo, tamales, and of course King Car and strawberry milk tea.  Yes we're fatties.... But we wanted to try a little bit of everything!  Nothing disappointed!   The restaurant is small but a good size.  The workers make it seem like a family place...which is comforting and adds to the Guam atmosphere.  It reminds me of grandma and grandpa and the uncles grilling it up while the little cousins serve the food.  :)))). Our food didn't take long to come out and the place was packed. After reading other reviews we anticipated a wait, but it was average.    I can't wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu.  I'm hoping they get pickled mangos added to the menu eventually...and potato salad!!  Then it'll really feel like home.  Im Korean, but have yet to try the kimchi.  Im very picky about my kimchi and not sure what to expect!  I'm also excited to see this place grow with good business and island decorations in the inside.",

    "text": "I've been obsessed with Chamorro food since I saw a food truck on TV. That was back in tx and Chamorro food was unheard of. Fast forward a year and I was so super excited to have found this place.   Food: 5 Ambience: 3 Service: 3  Average out to 3.6 stars but the food is good and that's what it's about.   Food: I ordered the fiesta plate, coconut titiyas, and red rice musubi  Fiesta plate comes with red rice, bbq rib, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina dene, bbq beef, bbq chicken, shrimp fritter and an egg roll.  So when I opened the container my first thought was \"well damn not that much food for the price\" but I seriously don't know what the heck I was thinking. Individually the portions are not much but collectively I couldn't finish and had a little snack left for later.  The red rice was really tasty and there was enough to eat with the meats. Bbq rib was a little dry and tough- was my least favorite. Chicken kelaguen was everything I thought it would be lol. I can't even explain it but it was exactly what I expected in my little food fantasy. Totally yum and must eat it with the coconut titiyas. Cucumber fina dene was good- light and refreshing with a light tang. I could seriously eat it every day. Bbq chicken was tender and good. The egg roll and shrimp patty was eh. Not my favorite.   The musubi was ah-mazing!!!! They take your everyday musubi and make it incomparable. Seriously. Like I don't even enjoy regular musubi anymore. They totally ruined it for me. The flavor combination of red rice, crunchy veggie, spicy sauce and spam is a happy symphony in my mouth.   Ambience: typical strip mall location with booths against one side and the cooking on the other. They have some island decor happening and happy music playing.   Service: this is where it got funky. It wasn't a service issue for me but more of a time issue. I think they were either backed up with orders or didn't have enough manpower behind the counter. Either way my food was supposed to be ready in 25 mins and the wait ended up being 45 mins. Both times I went I waited over 40 mins. No Bueno for anyone with a short lunch. Thankfully I'm not on a time crunch but the hubs was a little irritated by the wait.   The peeps there were super nice and even explained to me what each dish was and how to pronounce it properly.   I just wish the wait was not as long and they were open a little later but really this will not stop me from returning and does not take away from the fact that they have bomb a$$ food. Thanks for making my first time initiation into Chamorro dining amazing!!",

It was different and tasty. Everything else was a flavor I felt I had already tasted, like the kelaguen tasted like larb. The egg roll was not special, like Panda Express brand.

Tasted very authentic and now there's a place I can go to when I'm craving some red rice and kelaguen. The kimchee was also great!   But, I think that next time, I will just order for pick up. Maybe it was the fact that they just opened, but the room for sitting is very limited. There's about 8 booths that seats 4 and one table for 6. There was 7 of us and someone had to sit in the car to eat. Yeah.... That wasn't too pleasant. The wait for the food is about 15-20 minutes after ordering. But the up side to that is that they make everything fresh.   Aside from that, I really have no complaints when it came to the quality and taste of the food. My niece and sister loved the lumpia (egg rolls) and I also liked it and the shrimp patty is also an honorable mention. Perhaps they might expand, which I hope they do. They are garnering alot of attention in the Islander community. And I wish them the best. I hope that they become very successful! I will definitely come back..for to go. LoL",

You definitely need to try their BBQ ribs, chicken kelaguen, finely chopped grilled chicken mixed with finely chopped onions, peppers, grated coconut and lemon, salt and pepper to taste.  Pickle papaya is green papaya thinly sliced and marinated in vinegar, water and salt and pepper to taste.  The shrimp patties are also a favorite.  Don't forget to order the bonnelos (a sweet dessert made from bananas, an island rendition of the banana bread, but with a twist.",

I walked in and noticed the great vibe music along with a full staff. I ordered the Hafa adai platter long with some fireee spam musubi. Totally Destroyed it all and ordered 2 more musubi for the ride home. If youre in vegas or stopping by, most definitely stop by here. Enjoy the food the music and the friendly staff.

    "text": "Hafa Adai! (\"Hello\" in Chamorro)  I always had this secret desire to have Guamanian food blow up and become a foodie trend. Slowly but surely my secret dream is coming to life, thanks to Red Rice graciously opening their doors and sharing their lovely culture and unique Island cuisine with the curious Nevada palates. But honestly, you have no idea how happy we are a Chamorro restaurant opened up in Vegas (Henderson area but still close enough!)! We missed Chamorro food so much and we haven't had it in over a year! Sad day, I know.   The food is made fresh to order, so you will encounter a minor wait; just make sure to call your order in advance if you are in a rush - Phone: (702) 912-4826. Also as of right now they are closed on Wednesdays! Here's was we ordered:   Fiesta Plate $12.50 - It's a ton of food; definitely enough for my fiance and I to share but we got 2 orders so that we can have lunch the next day! It comes with grilled beef, chicken, a rib (all meats have a dry seasoning), fried lumpia (egg-roll), a shrimp patty, chicken kelaguen (cold chicken salad), a cucumber/lettuce salad, of course you also get Chamorro Red Rice. The rice isn't loaded with much flavor or any intense ingredient, I just enjoy the unique texture and the color is gorgeously appetizing. The rib was juicy and very meaty with great flavor, the chicken also had nice flavor, yet our least favorite was the beef - we thought it was a tad too dry for our preference. The flavorful lumpia was extra crispy (a tad too oily), the shrimp patty had nice flavor, but the best had to be the chicken kelaguen!! It is so flavorful! The best I ever had. It offered a tasty citrus brightness to the meal. Also the simple cucumber salad that comes with the combo has such a dreamy and creamy dressing, I love it. Next time, I would probably skip the fiesta plate and just get either the rib, chicken plate, or just order the amazing chicken kelaguen all to myself. Flavor rating: 4/5  We also ordered Coconut Titiyas (coconut flavored bread/thick tortillas) - which you must eat it with the chicken kelaguen, that's the right way to eat it! They pair so perfectly, I couldn't stop eating it. Flavor rating: 5/5  The red rice spam musubi is also a winning item. It's as big, if not bigger than my hand and they make it with just the right proportions of spam sandwiched between moist red rice. It appears that they also put a little bit of scrambled egg and yellow pickled daikon pickle in it as well, which is delightful! Flavor Rating: 5/5  We also tried the fried empanada, as we never had it before so we quickly compared it to a fried beef taco? Apologies in advance for our ignorance, but we are only familiar with Chilean and Mexican empanadas. Flavor rating: 3/5  Best of all we adore Chamorro culture and the lovely family that runs it! Such nice people! Get this: We got to the restaurant at 6:50 pm and the signs stated they close at 7 pm. We chose to dine in as we were starving! As we dined, it went well past 7 pm and I noticed more patrons come inside and get served with a friendly smile. My fiance and I were wondering what their actual hours are, so we asked. They said that they technically close at 7 pm, but if they have customers they will still serve them and so they close Chamorro time! How cute is that? Such a breath of fresh air.   They really want to make you feel at home and they succeed. One of the sons Bobac, answered all of our questions about the menu in detail; he seems very business savvy and passionate about the business. After we dined, we had to make sure to compliment him numerous times on how happy we are that they are in Vegas now. He extended himself humbly and even offered us some sample of fried mochi on the house (which tasted like awesome carnival fried goodness!) We honestly didn't expect anything but the gesture is appreciated very much. We could also overhear the mother at the register, explaining the menu to some patrons that are new to Chamorro food and she was just as enthusiastic as outgoing. Such a generous and friendly environment. It truly speaks to Chamorro culture and how naturally down to earth they are.  We support them and their efforts! We also hope they last and encourage more folks to discover Chamorro food.",

Always willing to try new things, I called in and ordered the Fiesta Plate, Red Rice Musubi and Empanadas.   What can I say, the Fiesta Plate was really good! Very large portions enough to share... The ribs, beef and chicken were perfectly grilled. The chicken kelaguen, lumpia, and shrimp patty was very tasty and so was the salad. Empanadas were also good! Red rice Musubi yummy!!! All in all the food was very delicious!   Great food and customer service! Will definitely come back to try everything else... Thanks to my fellow yelpers for your reviews...",

    "text": "This is my second check in for Red Rice. I didn't want to leave a review for a restaurant that just opened and I was super ecstatic that  Guam food was finally in Las Vegas again! I grew up on the island and left after graduating from JFKHS. Go Islanders! There were definitely mixed reviews, but here's my version: 1. Naming the restaurant \"Red Rice\", one must live up to its name. Red rice is a staple in Guam. The right consistency, color, and taste of red rice should be spot on. My opinion, it's just aye OKAY.  2. Chicken kelaguin was way better than my first visit. However, too bad no fresh grated coconut and no charcoal grilled taste to the kelaguin (just like the traditional way of making kelaguin). And red onions were used versus white onions. 3. The pork ribs, sliced beef, and sliced chicken from the fiesta plate again did not have the HOT off the GRILL version which to me, would have been on the spot! Marination was mediocre. 4. Empanada version at Red Rice was not bad in taste, but color in and out was darker than the traditional empanada I remember buying them after school. To me, the most authentic tasting empanadas outside Guam is in Oceanside, Cali @ Guahan Grill. I suggest you bookmark it now! Oh, and their food - delish!  5. Spam musubi was pretty good. Used of red rice on musubi is gaining popularity. Their musubi version also consist of yellow pickled daikon. Last but not the least, shrimp patties I had ordered twice and still no visible shrimp on hand. Lots of veggies but taste still not the same from most Chamorro mom and pop restaurants back home.  6. On the positive side, I am glad Red Rice is available for those people who miss the food from the island. It can get busy, so just be patient to get your order right. It's a nice addition to Vegas.",

    "text": "Ever since True Island BBQ closed many lunar new years ago, there was a void in my life.  Until now.  OK that was a bit dramatic. Long story short, Red Rice isn't quite as good as True Island. But it's good enough.  I had the Fiesta Plate. At $12.50, it's more expensive than True Island's, but contains a wider variety of items. You get beef, chicken, a rib, some sort of seafood cake, a cold chicken salad, and a cucumber/lettuce salad. And of course you get that delicious Guamanian Red Rice (duh). I don't know what it is about that rice. It's not like it has a ton of flavor. I feel like it's mostly just color. But I enjoy it all the same.  I'll say that Red Rice's Red Rice is better than True Island's. True Island's chicken and beef were way more tender and flavorful though. And I miss True Island's awesome sauce/salad dressing. I actually don't know what it was but it was great on both their salad and for dipping the chicken/beef. It's probably unfair for me to keep comparing to True Island, but that was my first and until now, only experience with Guamanian cuisine.  The bottom line is that I'm still a fan of Red Rice and will definitely be grabbing lunch here again.  P.S. After reading a few reviews and the restaurant's responses, I highly recommend calling your order in ahead of time. Mine was ready exactly when they said it would be!",

I've only had it at Red Rice, but it's so good that it's hard to drive by without stopping for a box of takeout... unless it's a Wednesday, when they're closed, and then I just get upset. So far, I've liked everything I've tried here except for the ribs, and that's just a personal preference.   The Fiesta plate is a good introduction to different dishes, but whatever you decide on, always add some red rice musubi. The food is homestyle and a touch greasy, but the pickled veggies and various sauces from the salads add acidity and balance. The red rice and grilled meats are always cooked perfectly, and the portions are so large that the shrimp patties and chicken kelaguen are usually leftover for the next day. If you want to end your meal with something sweet, get the bonnelos!",

    "text": "I grew up on the island of Guam and love the island food. Carmen (the owner) and her boys brought the island cooking to Vegas. The Hafa Adai plate was authentic Chamorro food. Shrimp patties, octopus kelaquen, empanadas, coconut Titian's and more brought back childhood memories of fiesta and fandango celebrations to mind. At the same time, I enjoyed the Chamorro punch that Sis Carmen made. Ai aday! I wish I could purchase lunch plates everyday for my staff in Orange County, CA. All in all,It was a great day to eat authentic Chamorro dishes. I purchased 2 shirts to help advertise this restaurant I want to spread the word! Btw, I went to school with her cousin back in the day. Thanks again,",

The ribs were not as great. Empanada was awesome, overall the plate was pretty good - the red rice spam musubi was really great tho. Would recommend the plate just minus the ribs (a little tough) Overall solid 4/5",

    "text": "Came here Sunday after a night of EDC and had an amazing recovery meal. I never had Guamanian food before, but what a great first impression this was. The delicious red rice and meat was the perfect thing thing to get me going again.   We got the hafa adai and the local plate (only difference is the empanada and the fried shrimp balls) First off, the food itself has a sense of home cooked food. Not heavy on the flavor or fancy looking, but still amazingly delicious and hits the right spot. The red rice is hard to describe, but it has a subtle taste to it that made it appealing. Adding the sauce they provide actually makes the rice taste noticeably different when compared to eating each separate components by itself. The meat was seasoned well and had a great char to it. The tangy cucumbers and shredded meat was a nice refresher to have between each bites. I personally really liked the fried shrimp balls more than the empanadas, but both were delicious.   I will definitely come back when I am in Vegas again!",

Summary: long wait time. skip the grilled meats and get the other items.   Onto the plate: Sub the salad if possible it's a throwaway and makes the fiesta plate feel like it's not worth the price.   Can the red rice can be more red? If eaten with the meats it gets lost. And the meat just tastes like grilled meats. The beef and pork was tough. Chicken was the best. The chicken kelaguen was good reminded me of larb. But the best thing were the shrimp patties! Crispy outside and tender in the center.   Beef kelaguen was nice (like beef ceviche) and one of the better things i had. Ordered it with yummy corn (+1$) titiya(tortilla)   Spam musubi was good but again would be better if the red rice was more spiced or however they make it. Tasted like any other musubi.  I'm no expert in Guam food but I didn't feel like I got a real taste of it from what I ordered.",

I ordered the Grand Opening Plate which had 2 scoops of red rice, 1 scoop of chicken kelaguen, 1 lumpia, 1 shrimp patty, house salad (it was a choice between potato salad, grilled eggplant with coconut milk, or cucumber salad), bbq chicken, 1 bbq pork rib, bbq beef and a side of dipping sauce for the meat. The red rice was as it should be, orange-reddish color and not dry or too wet with a subtle flavor of achote which definitely complimented the other items on the plate.  The bbq chicken was my favorite out of all the bbq.  Grilled eggplant with coconut milk was just like my mom used to make, creamy and somewhat smoky with a slight citrus twist.    I went to Red Rice for dinner during their grand opening and though there was a bit of a wait, it was understandable.  The service was great though.  They apologized for the wait and even gave me 10% off my next visit which is a plus because I will be back.  The only con was the limited parking but I didn't mind walking over from the adjacent plaza.    Red Rice definitely does Guam proud!",

We met Frank, the owner. He is so friendly and personable. So was the rest of the family. I will for sure go back when I'm in town.",

I waited at the counter while everyone on the other side just turned around and looked at me without acknowledging me with a welcome or hi. I guess there's only 1 person who takes the order and $ who does the greeting. There def is a lot of food in the plate. Wasn't super impressed with the bbq. It was a little bland but then I guess that's why they had the soy sauce and vinegar on the side for you to add to the meat. Im glad I tried it but don't plan on going back",

I've been to Guam countless times as I have relatives on both ends of the island (in addition to couple visits during my military deployments) so am pretty confident to say that I kinda know Chamorro food.  Most of Chamorro dishes are Pinoy-based (i.e. lumpia, pancit, kelaguen, among others) so I know most Guamanians/Chamorros frequent Filipino buffets in the valley when they crave something from the island.  If there's one dish that uniquely theirs is, of course, the red rice but still, Red Rice's red rice didn't measure up to what I've had and what my Santa Rita and Dededo-based aunties prepare.   I once brought my LA friends/relatives here for lunch and had their various combos for lunch.  Then, we all walked to nearby Island Sushi Grill to eat some more :).",

The fiesta plate comes with lumpia (pork egg roll), Bbq chicken, Bbq spare ribs, chicken kelaguen, cucumber salad, and a shrimp patty. They all taste just as I remember. Just amazing!   Don't forget to try the pickled mango and papaya. These are Guamanian side dishes and/or snacks that you can find at any local market around the island.   Also, don't forget the finadene dipping sauce! It's a must have with any Guamanian dish!",

I tried my first Guamanian food at this little mom and pop restaurant, where you order at the counter. The woman who took our order was extremely helpful and explained each dish. We both chose the Hafa Adai!  The food is freshly made, so it takes time, but it is worth the wait. The bbq chicken is delicious. I liked the pork rib. The rice is great, with a yummy flavor! My favorite thing was the empanada- so perfect! The cucumber fina denne and chicken kelaguen were surprising, because they are served cold...definitely dishes to try. We'll be back!

Eating the food brought back memories.  Some delicious food here. Don't forget the finidune. Lady that took my order was very nice to me. I'll definitely be back before I fly home.",

I would think that by now, most locals from Guam would know of this place and add it to their list of must-haves when in Vegas.  So.....  this review is mainly meant for those who have never heard of or had any Guam food.  Bottom line:  The bbq taste is going to be different than probably any you've had.  But, will you like it?!  Not kidding, you will probably LOVE it regardless of which may you choose.   It's that distinct soy sauce and lemony combo.   And if you don't love or at least like it, then at least you can say you tried something new, right?    A side note - locals like to congregate and talk.  It's an island thing...  just let them be. :-)",

You wont be disappointed. the plate is $12.95 which might sound expensive, but the plate is filled with like 6 different things to try, and all of them are delicious.  The people that work there are very nice, and they all seem like they are putting a lot of effort into making this a good place for people to go. Some of the reviews that have \"hated\" on this place don't really make sense to me.

So glad this place was recommended to me and I will do the same to everyone who loves Asian-islander food or just wanting to try something different but full of flavor! My personal favorite is the spam musubi and the empanadas but the combo/fiesta platters are a must and I will be going back soon for more. YUM. Well priced and good location.",

The place is clean, the staff is friendly, there are TV's you can glance at while waiting for your food, and they have Chamorro decor around the restaurant. We ordered the Hafa Adai plate which includes: red rice, salad with cucumbers & some sauce, ribs, chicken, chicken kelaguen, an empanada, and finadene. Enough to feed two hungry people =) I thought the food was good, although I'm a little biased to my wife's Chamorro cooking. I'd definitely go back and try some more things, once we're back in Vegas. I feel the need to support fellow Chamorro's and I hope they keep this place open for a long time!",

The coconut titiyas are melt in your mouth good. The latiya is great. I love the jars of pickled papaya. Mmmm. All we need to remind us of 7 eleven back home is chicken kelaguen wrapped in tortillas and pickled mangos. Another bonus is the Assam black tea and milk teas. I have referred people over. Their only complaint is the wait. I wish you guys the best. I would love to see you be around for a long time.

The food is much better, everything from the meats, shrimp patty to the finadene. Very authentic that's for sure. Sodium levels improved so it wasn't overwhelming. Last 3 times I've seen improvements so I am happy and will definitely be back with some friends. I really appreciated the service, making exceptions on certain things for me & the lil things to show the island spirit.

It had a piece of BBQ pork rib, some BBQ chicken, 2 pieces of small shrimp patties (shaped like balls), chicken kelaguen and cucumber Fina denne' with 2 small scoops of red rice. It's basically a BBQ plate..  We also ordered an octopus kelaguen for $7.50 and was in a small container. I'll tell you the kelaguen had a nice flavor but would be worth it if it came with a scoop of red rice.  I believe we were just turned off waiting that long for food but at least we can say we've tried this place. We can get BBQ at other places for bigger portions for the price we paid.",

We ordered Mix platter or as they call it hafa adai ($15) and a spam masubi ($4 for 1). The food was good and savory.

Nothing to complain about.  Food: Hot and ready The food served met my expectations. I ordered a half order of the rice and some sort of BBQ. Priced a reasonable price, the food came hot, flavorful, and smoky. The rice was a little oily for my liking, however.  Summary: Not bad at all!

    "text": "Went in on an early Saturday evening so it wasn't too busy. I ordered the shrimp patties and a few empanadas. My BF is Chamorro so I've had these items before, only homemade. Everything was fried to order and was piping hot when I received it. The shrimp patties were seasoned well but were definitely lacking in shrimp, which doesn't bode well for something with shrimp in its name. I gave one to my BF's Mom and she asked me if it was vegan (LOL) because she didn't see any shrimp in her patty either. The empanada was also seasoned well and was nice and crispy with plenty of filling in them. BF's Mom said they were ok, which says a lot because the woman knows how to cook!  Having had homemade Chamorro food before, specifically the items I ordered today, the food I received from Red Rice was just decent. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other items.",

    "text": "Very reminiscent of the food back on the island. I've been wanting to try Red Rice for a very long time. I finally had the chance last week and it was a great experience.  I had the Hafa Adai plate which contains the empanadas, ribs, chicken kelaguen and grilled chicken. For those that are unfamiliar with Guam food aka Chamorro food, I strongly recommend trying the chicken kelaguen with finadeni. It is a signature Chamorro dish and it comes in either chicken, spam, shrimp, and deer (I don't think they offer the deer though). Regardless, it is a very delicious destination for lunch.  The only thing they can improve on is the waiting time. I was the only guest there and it took a while to get my food. I'm sure this is because the food is grilled on the spot and takes time, so it's not a big deal but some people might get impatient.  Overally, great food, great vibes, go try it sometime!",

    "text": "I grew up eating Guamanian food and it's been so many years since I last had Chicken Kelaguen. This is a side dish that is usually made with minced chicken, freshly grated coconut, lemon juice, spices and chopped scallions. I got the Hafa Adai Plate, which includes two scoops of Red Rice, one BBQ Pork Spare Rib, BBQ Chicken, Cucumber Slices with Fina'denne' sauce, Chicken Kelaguen, a Chicken Empanada, plus an extra order of Empanada and Grilled Eggplant Salad to share.   The highlight are the BBQ Pork Spare Rib and BBQ Chicken. The meat is very tender, flavorful and it's marinated well. The Red Rice has a dry, smokey flavor and it taste okay. It's not spicy as it looks. I had to add Fina'denne' sauce on the Red Rice and mix in the Cucumber Slices to make it taste better. The Chicken Empanada didn't taste like there was chicken. The filling looks like mashed Red Rice in a Fried Crispy Tortilla Shell. And the Grilled Eggplant Salad looks similar to a creamy Tzatziki dip. It taste like smokey and mashed eggplant mixed in a tangy yogurt sauce. Now for the Chicken Kelaguen, I didn't see any freshly grated coconut mixed in and to be honest here, it taste kind of dry. So I had to add more Fina'denne' sauce to flavor the chicken.   Overall, the meal is good to share for two people and the restaurant is clean. I'm just not happy about the Chicken Empanada and Grilled Eggplant Salad, and the Chicken Kelaguen is an acquired taste. I'm probably more accustomed to having quality flavor in Guam. But if you've never had Guamanian food and you're curious about the flavor, you should at least try it and see if it's something you like.",

It took a while for our food to come out, and typically we would have been irritated. But the lady at the counter continually apologized, and offered us little cookies while we were waiting. I thought the gesture was super sweet - and when the food finally came, it was so worth it!!   You can definitely tell by the way the food is prepared that its cooked with so much love. They put alot of effort into everything they make and its music to my tummy",

Throughout those few years, I missed eating red rice because there were literally no other places that served Guamanian food in Las Vegas. When Red Rice opened, I was ecstatic that Vegas had another opportunity to have Guamanian food!  My favorite dishes to get are the chicken plate and the red rice spam musubi! The chicken is very flavorful, and the red rice is definitely on point! Next time, I want to try their chicken kelaguen since it is a specialty from Guam! I've only had chicken kelaguen once when my friend made it, so I definitely want to try Red Rice's!  If you are looking for a unique cuisine and are in the Henderson area, take a visit to Red Rice! You won't regret it!",

We walked in and got greeted asap! Customer service was great!   As we were looking at the menu, the cashier asked us if we had any questions.  I didn't at the moment, then he asked had we ever had g\\Guam food, or been there before, we said no.  So he went on to explain all the dishes to us.....ummmm it was pretty over whelming, so I just went with the combo.  I knew I wanted to try the ribs, but might as well try it all. Welp....This wasn't my cup of tea! The only thing I liked was the salad, and the chicken.  The Chicken Kelaguen was ok, once I threw it in the salad.  The BBQ beef, BBQ pork and the spare ribs weren't  tender at all!  I wont be revisiting this establishment!",

We got to the restaurant just before noon and I'm glad we did because it started to get \"jam packed\".  I ordered the Hafa Adai plate and asked to substitute the empanada for shrimp patty (Basta Umbe don't judge me).  The dude was like \"shoot shoot chelu no problem\". My wife ordered the kelaguen sampler with corn titiyas.  Unless you're at your village fiesta and the DJ is playing cha cha while you're chowing and drinking a Budweiser it doesn't get any better than this. The rib (yes I said rib) was tender and so was the chicken. Red rice was cooked good and the shrimp patty... I didn't get to try it because my wife chowed it. The beef kelaguen was almost as good as Nana's(sorry nobody makes it better than Nana). Scoop some of that chicken kelaguen onto that corn titiya and it's on like Donkey Kong.  Overall the food was great and I will always support our islanders near and far. Biba Guahan! Biba Red Rice!",

    "text": "Out here this week for another family gathering. My family decided to try this place out again. This time was fair.  Let's say they have been open over a year an they still use a banner sign in front of the business. We were hoping for more decor improvements to represent Guam. Inside was much better made us feel like everything from back home was represented well.  But all the other business around have nice outdoor sign of business logo & name. I think they should invest in a nice red rice sign outside like the other business around them.  The wait for a to go call still took 25-30 minutes we called in the worker who answered said 15-20 but when we got there took another 10-15 minutes so total of 1/2 an hour. Food was cold so we microwaved our food.   I ordered the chicken plate again it was better this time not as dry & more flavor still char broiled but that was ok. I still can taste the other meats that they must cook their meats on the same grill or use the same utensils because I can taste beef when I'm a chicken eater. The rice wasn't mushy this time it was bland but better not a wet & uncooked like last time. The cucumbers were a little soggy & bitter but it's probably was soaking to long I prefer my cucumbers crisp I know some Chamorros like it marinated longer so my cousin ate the rest of my cucumbers.  Masubi was still not my cup of tea but it's so hyped up I had to try it again. I just can't really get the red rice & wrap but that's ok the kids liked it.  We tried their corn soup it was not thick a little runny but seasoned well just needed a little more corn starch to make it thick.   Empanadas hasn't changed the mushy no chicken still so I would have to say no to this.  Had a little kelaguen I also would say needs just a little more lemon & pika. Can't taste the coconut. More like ceviche or sisig. LOL!   Lumpia still the same not a fan but kids enjoyed it. My husband had the beef plate he said a bit better this time around not a chewy & tough but wished they served it warmer or hot when plate came out.  Latijas were good. Kids enjoyed .  All in all its continued progress & wish this business best of luck. The chamorro community is very big so you will always have critics. Keep up the good work!   I want to give a 3-4 star but just a few more fixes then they will be there the tables weren't clean for us to wait on for our food so I went back outside to wait for our food. If dining area was clean it would of been better for us to wait in doors it was hot outside.",

The family running the place is nice, and the food is done well.  There is a wait due to the food being cooked to order.    The last time we were here, I had the fiesta plate, some empanadas, and tatiyas.  It was delish.  I would definitely stop in for a quick Guam food fix when needed.",

When I first mentioned my craving to my boyfriend, he found and brought me to some empanada places but they were more hispanic or spanish style. They were good but not the same flavor I was craving. There are just no chamorro places in LA.  We made a trip to the Hoover dam and vegas area, and I decided to look up chamorro food and found this place. Got the plate with empanadas in it, and brought some home also. My brother loved the red rice. My mom learned how to make some from a guamanian but it always tasted a little different from the ones we used to eat on island (including KFC red rice - remember that??). The chicken kelaguen, finadeni, and red rice were exactly like the ones from my childhood. The meat was delcious and reminded me of our class fundraisers - selling hot plates next to the beach on a weekend morning. Good times.  The empanada however was just okay. It was not spicy at all like I remember, and a little too crunchy for me. So I'm still on the lookout - maybe I'll be able to find it the next time I go to San Diego. There are a few down there. :)",

It will definitely be a stop we make every time we're in town. I craved their food all year long and made sure to visit during our most recent trip. The fiesta plate has a good selection of items and everything is delicious. The flavors are bold and they give you generous servings. I was so excited to eat my food that I completely forgot to snap pics beforehand. The chicken kelaguen is my favorite part of the platter: it's so tangy and delicious, especially with the soy sauce mix you can get on the side. Gah my mouth is watering just thinking of it! Don't forget to try the red rice musubi as a side and the coconut titiyas, which is like a lightly sweet coconut pancake. So good! And the service is wonderful! They are the most friendly folks and you can tell they appreciate their customers. They genuinely enjoy being able to share their delicious cuisine and that makes it that much more enjoyable. Highly recommend! You can't go wrong here!",

We ordered the grand opening plate and tamales giyo. The red rice was good, the BBQ a little dry (not truly BBQ Chamorro way), the chicken keliguen was awful(no coconut or green onions), the potato salad was ok, the tamales gyso didn't even have the bacon in it, the finadene didn't have any Donne and they didn't have Donne to offer (Chammoro's like food pika), the shrimp patty wasn't fully cooked (and where was the shrimp?), the empanadas were tiny; the filling wasn't traditional; and they were burnt, the service was SUPER SLOW, the shrimp keliguen was gross (no coconut, no shrimp, just a container of lemon juice). I hate to give such a bad review because I want our people to succeed, however, it's embarrassing to have \"Red Rice\" represent our island and cultural food if it's not authentic. Sorry \"Red Rice\" your place needs much improvement.",

The spare ribs are arguably the best my boyfriends ever had he said. Their chicken and steak are cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Spring roll and and side salad are light a full of great flavors. The salad dressing is sweet but zesty with a little spice then tang and creaminess to it. I could eat a giant bowl of there freshly chopped salad. The spring rolls are the best in town straight up, and if your feeling like getting down order extra and thank me later.  I will be coming back. The owner or co owner that works there gave us free deep fried mochi while we waited for our food. Her son brought us some sauces and silver wear. They asked us how we like the food and were genuine on asking and eager to hear our responses. Such a warm and laid back atmosphere with friendly staff. Like I said its family owned so you definitely get that family vibe which means they treat you and hook it up like your family.  I will be on a first name bases with these people in no time.",

With a bit of everything, I was able to share half my meal and still feel satisfied.  Spam musubi: has the red rice,  furikake, and spam. The red rice made it tastier.  Latiya: delicious cake. It was moist and sweet but good enough to not feel too bad about eating it.  Chamorro beignet: just like a normal beignet with a drizzle of mango sauce. Pretty good.   The lady at the front was really friendly and we got a complimentary beignet probably because it was pretty slow when we got there.   There is happy hour Monday through Friday, 2pm to 6pm.",

To whomever is reading this review please give them a try and if I may add a suggestion myself;the black tea was very authentic you'd think you were in Guam if your eyes were closed,not to mention how refreshing & ice cold it was.",

Shrimp kelaguen was good! Not too spicy, but had the zest. Coconut titiyas made fresh and melted in your mouth.  While I waited for my order, I talked with the owner Uncle Frank- very friendly and hardworking.  Food and people are the reasons I'd definitely go back!

The rice was different but a good different which made the spam even that much better. The ribs were a bit to tough for our liking but the grilled BBQ flavor was definitely there. The shrimp patty was amazing but more like a shrimp ball. For the first time I tried the chicken kelaguen but not one of my faves because it almost tasted like sour canned tuna. Must be an acquired taste.  The lumpia had a weird after taste and I Love lumpia but couldn't get myself to eat a second bite. It's almost as if it's made ahead of time, kept frozen and then fried to order so the taste was like freezer burn. Will come back for sure and try something else!",

The fiesta plate, spam masubi, tamales, and titiyas were good. The fiesta plate doesn't come with beef anymore. For the kelaguen sampler I got chicken, beef, and octopus. The chicken and beef were good. The octopus was sliced pretty thick so it made harder to chew and felt more rubbery. I think I spit almost half of it out. At the end of our meal we order some empanadas and it took awhile to come out. It wasn't busy that day and there was only 3 parties in the restaurant. When we got the empanadas it is was burnt. I would have been embarrassed to serve it to anyone.",

We also ordered the titiyas mahna, pickled papaya and daikon brined in Kimchi base, beef kelaguen,octopus kelaguen, spam musubi and latiya for dessert. The grilled chicken and ribs were tender, juicy, and well seasoned.  Finedene was not needed. The kelaguen was eaten with the titiyas, the beef was awesome but the octopus was a bit chewy, probably needs to be beaten with a mallet or parboiled to soften it a little more.  The red rice spam misubi was the big surprise.  It's not your ordinary misubi you find a the Hawaiian BBQ.  It has that wow factor in the rice, sauce, and filling.  It was nice meeting Carmen and Frank again.  Sorry we missed you Chris. They are hard working passionate people who really love cooking and preparing Guamanian food.   Las Vegas Chamorros are lucky to have them in the area.  We can only get their cooking now when visiting Las Vegas from the San Francisco Bay Area.",

I gave this place a 3 star rating on the soul fact that I love and support my island people, but when something is overly exsadurated I have too be honest so when my wife said red rice I said let's do it babe let's go try it and be fun and open minded about it cause my best friend is from Guam and I love his moms cooking. To my surprise the food was over prized and not all that great I say this because I favor quality over quantity, even though the average person would say it was a lot of food I say it was decent. I was very unhappy with overall experience here the reason being is that I ordered two musubis and a plate here and spent twenty one dollars okay red rice is great but 3.25 a scoop is a little over the top the owners were kind so I had to be nice about my review.",

    "text": "Viva Chamorro food! There's Guamanian food in Las Vegas! Now we all can enjoy the Hafa Adai spirit while grubbing on Chamorro food off of South Eastern Ave near Henderson.  My affinity towards Guamanian food began 25 years ago when my good friend and her family from Guam opened up a restaurant across the street from our high school in Chula Vista, CA. Red rice. Chicken bbq. Chicken kelaguen. Shrimp kelaguen. All drizzled with Finadene!! Yum!!  Red Rice offers all of the above and more! I just wish I had more time in Vegas and a bigger stomach to enjoy it all, but I'll be back soon.  My niece and I went pretty simple and decided on Nene sized plates (similar to Keiki or kids size): Chicken and Rib plus our choice side of potato salad. The meats were tender and tasty to bbq perfection. The red rice was a nice shade of orange-red achoite seasoned with hints of onion and garlic. Now top it all off with some finadene sauce (soy sauce, lemon, vinegar, green onion, and hot chili peppers). Mmm. So good!  We had Shrimp Kelaguen on the side which is very similar to ceviche. It's fresh shrimp, diced and marinated in salted lemon juice. To calm the tartness, shredded coconut is usually mixed in, but I really didn't taste enough in this serving. I just love coconut and wish there was a little more. My eyes were squinting way too much! Lol.  To satisfy out sweet tooth, we finished our meal with some hot Chamorro Beignets. Yum! The coconut donuts topped off with powdered sugar and mango sauce. So good!  Aloha and mahalo, Red Rice!! Thank you for bringing Chamorro food to Vegas. Be back soon!!",

Sure, it's a little off the beaten path but well worth a try for a unique harty meal and to support the cause. Food was fairly close to the real deal for being in a resturant environment. Their bbq hit the flavor profile while everything else lacked in my preferred spice levels. I like my finadenne extremely hot with tons of donne & onions. But thats a palate thing :)  No, it's not Hawaiian nor is it Filipino food. Just another island spot that can definitely kill the backyard bbq game. Pretty tasty if your willing to wait and appreciate a cusine outside your norm.",

    "text": "Pro tip: get the Hafa Adai Plate and 2 Spam Musubi's and share with someone, so you can both try a bunch of tasty foods!   Their combo plates are big enough to share with another person, and for a great price ($13-$14). In the Hafa Adai Plate, the Chicken Kelaguen is ground chicken that is served cold; it has a slight tanginess and sourness to it but is quite addicting. It is great to eat with the side of red rice the meal comes with. The BBQ chicken in this plate is also amazing; the chicken is juicy and tender, having a slight smokiness to it. It can be eaten alone or with the red rice as well.   If you are looking for something lighter, their Spam Musubi is wonderful! They use red rice, diago, and a special spicy house sauce in their musubi that makes it different from all the other spam musubis out there. The sauce is pretty spicy, but it offsets the saltiness of the Spam well.",

    "text": "Love me some Chamorro-style shrimp patties!  Red Rice is an adorable restaurant that offers delicious and unique flavors from Guam. The owners are very sweet and welcoming.  The portions are huge! Thankfully, it was perfect to share between my coworker and I. We chose the Hafa Adai Plate. Which pretty much came equipped with a taste of everything - but I needed to order a side of shrimp patties anyway - they're so good! The BBQ chicken and Empanada were my top two favorites on the plate. The BBQ pork spare rib had great flavor but ours was a little dry. My coworker liked the chicken kelaguen and cucumber fina denne - but I can honestly pass on those two next time. Have I mentioned the shrimp patties? I am sure I have but I want to make sure you know how good they are. SO GOOD.   If you plan on stopping in during your lunch break, do yourself a favor an call ahead! When we stopped in, we waited 30 minutes for our food and it wasn't overly crowded. The food was delicious but it took half of my lunch just to start eating.   I will definitely be back...but only if I have the time to wait or for a to-go order.",

    "text": "The ordering here is very similar to Hawaiian bbq places - you order at the register first and then seat yourself and they call your name when your order is ready.  We ordered the Hafa Adai plate, empanadas, and spam musubi. The cashier said the Hafa Adai plate was the most popular and that people usually share it. It wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be, but definitely sharable for 2 people who aren't super hungry. It comes with bbq chicken, 1 spare rib, cucumbers, red rice, and an empanada. The chicken had a nice grilled taste to it but it was a little dry in the middle. The spare rib was pretty good, but they only give you 1 compared to like 8 pieces of chicken. The red rice was really good - it had a very subtle flavor but tasted noticeably different than white rice. The cucumbers went really well with this plate too, it helped out when the chicken was a little too dry.  The empanadas side dish comes with 3 empanadas and they were deep fried and the skins tasted like corn taco shells. Inside was I think mashed red rice with some pieces of chicken. They were super crunchy but pretty much just tasted like rice, and I felt really thirsty after each bite I took. Other than that, the texture of it was really nice and made me want to keep eating it.  The spam musubi comes with spam, red rice, Furikaki, daigo (pickled radish), and spicy house sauce wrapped in seaweed. I liked how they had Furikaki and daigo - it was different than the average spam musubi. It does come with a lot of rice though.  Overall, the food here is pretty tasty. It was definitely very unique and a good dining experience.",

    "text": "First time trying Guamanian food and my oh my how have I not discovered it earlier? I had no idea what to expect, and I imagined it'd be similar to Hawaiian food. Boy was I wrong... Chamorro dishes are so unique, full of body and culture and above all, endless flavor  Came in to a restaurant filled with a wonderful aroma. I was wondering which restaurant smelled so good when I got out my car and lo and behold it was Red Rice! The menu was simple but confusing to me because I didn't know anything about any of the items. But the person taking my order was very patient and helpful with my questions. Great service  We ordered the chicken nene plate and the rib nene plate to share. I love that they offer the nene (half plate) option since we were just looking for a light bite before going to Hot Pilates. The food came out fairly quick, all wrapped up nicely in to go boxes. The boxes were small but so so heavy with food. The mouthwatering smell of the BBQ meats hit me as soon as I opened the box. The meats tasted even better than they smelled! So juicy and flavorful, grilled to perfection. I love the sides of red rice  Both plates came with a side of choice and I chose potato salad and the cucumber daigo kimchi. Both are refreshing, especially the pickled savory/sour cold cucumber with daigo. The kimchi offers a slight kick  I also got a side of Chicken Kelaguen (diced grilled chicken marinated in lemon, served chilled) for just $2. What a steal! It was refreshing to the BBQ but somewhat lacked in flavor. I don't know what could make it better but I'd order it again nonetheless. I'd love to come back to try the other Kelaguen as well   4.5 rounded to 5 stars for this quick late lunch. Thank you Red Rice for introducing me to the cuisine of the wonderful island of Guam. I will be back to try more of the menu",

The BBQ chicken is so juicy and tender with an AWESOME home cooked smokey flavor that is enhanced with a tangy Finna Denne' dipping sauce. The Chicken Kelaguen is so refreshing and smart! The toasted rice and shredded chicken empanada is crispy and zesty with a subtle spicey kick that gives it a lot of personality. The BBQ Pork Spare Rib was meaty and perfectly cooked--fall off the bone nicely when you bite into it. And let me not forget the red rice... perfectly cooked, lots of flavor, but not too salty and the authentic spices make me feel like I've traveled to Guam on vacation. The magic of this restaurant is in its authenticity and in its simplicity. Red Rice of Las Vegas is pure soul food!",

It's a small place, so not ideal for large crowds.  But you can order ahead and pick-up will be timely.

We were treated with a friendly face that just knew we were new to the joint. Due to my cousin's shrimp allergy we skipped on the local plate and went with the Hafa Adai instead with a side of Spam Musubi's. BEST DAMN MUSUBI I've had. Holy hell in a seaweed roll. They weren't kidding about that red rice. The rice infused with the spice, meat and sauce made it all melt in my mouth. I could have made a meal of 10 of those.   Our entree came out soon after finishing finishing our musubi's. I'd like to take a minute to thank the staff at Red Rice and heir consideration for my cousin's shrimp allergy. Their empanada that came with the meal, were told, was actually fried in shrimp oil. They fully separated it from our actually entree in order to avoid cross contamination. That's not just service, that's care for your customers. Thank you!   Red rice was obviously to die for (I've said it 2x now), chicken was soft and bone meat was juicy and complimented well with the pickled cucumbers. Definitely add this place on your bookmarks if you want a taste of Guam (locally).",

    "text": "Born and raised on Guam, left with the hubster and kids in 2004 for DC, where my friends and I don't indulge in making local favorites often enough. So when I got the opportunity to go to Vegas on business, a visit to Red Rice topped the To Do list.  Blanched at the prospect of a $30 cab fare from the strip, so I decided to take the city bus - not a journey to be taken lightly for a sissified island girl gone soft after 10 years in the northern VA suburbs.   Two buses and an hour later, I walked through the doors and got a taste of home - from the super nice folks behind the counter to the tangy OOG marinade on the barbecued meats to the smoke wafting through the restaurant from the grill. Ordered the fiesta plate and a slew of sides to take back to my hotel (sweet titiyas, spam musubi with red rice, guyuria, shrimp crackers and lemon powder for making kelaguen back  in VA).  For those coming here complaining about this and that, get over it. Your memories of the food on island are colored by your own personal experiences...kelaguen is made different on every fiesta table, no one is going to make empanadas like your grandma or auntie. Yes, you may be going into a restaurant hangry but that doesn't mean you need to give attitude - in person or online - to hardworking folks trying to make a decent living in this economy.  To anyone from home visiting Vegas and feeling mahalang, it is worth an hourlong bus ride from the strip through sometimes sketchy neighborhoods. The cultural shift from glitz to grim on the way will humble you back to your island roots.   Kudos to the owners and staff at Red Rice on opening their island oasis in the Nevada desert.",

Today I decided to go to Red Rice on my lunch break and was rather excited after looking at the pictures and checking the reviews. Unfortunately my experience was less than pleasant, it wasn't even an experience at all. As soon as I walked in it felt like I was interrupting a funeral service. The lady behind the counter made a loud scream and then continued to do whatever it was she was doing. There was a couple at a table that assumed worked there because the gentleman got up as if he was going to take my order but then sat down. A man behind the counter looked at the lady in a way as to wonder if she was going to help me or not. I assumed since she didn't want to be bothered, the man would help, he turned around and walked back to the kitchen. I stood there for maybe another 2-3 minutes until I came to the conclusion that I was not welcomed in this establishment. Let me say that this place was completely empty and if the couple at the table worked there then I was the only customer there. I am a COOK or rather a non professional Chef. Places like ruin the culinary experience. When your guest excited about spending his/her money to experience your food you should appreciate it and make the guest feel welcome. But this story ends well... I decided to take a chance with the Thai restaurant next door, which I will later write a review on. Before I could get all the way through the door I was greeted, the gentleman even went over the menu with me and my food was great! They could give Red Rice a few lessons in social skills.",

Next time I come back, I will only order the chicken because I feel like that's where I get the most out of my money.   I'm giving it a 4 star because it was hot in there, specially if you sit further into the store. Also the ribs were overpriced for 3 pieces.",

    "text": "I was going to go to the Poke place two doors down when I saw the signs of a Guam restaurant.  I've never had Guam food and really had no idea what the cuisine was like so we changed plans and decided to go in.  The person at the register was probably 15 or 16 but he was really patient with us as we asked him to explain various things on the menu.  We were a little unclear with our order and ended up with the breaded shrimp appetizer instead of the breaded shrimp plate.  When we asked what was what (because we actually didn't know), the cook (and likely owner) immediately understood the confusion and cooked us a breaded shrimp plate as well.    All in all we had the breaded shrimp appetizer: radish, shrimp wrapped in red rice and then wrapped in seaweed.  We might have ordered it by accident but it was the best thing we had.   Octopus - cold octopus in a lemon sauce.  Very delicious.  Lots of octopus too.  Would definitely order it again.  Breaded shrimp platter - 4 lovely deep fried and breaded shrimp.  A bed of delicious red rice and a cucumber salad.  I believe that this actually comes with potato salad normally but I was happy to have cucumbers instead.  Eggplant Salad - sort of like a less smokey version of babba ganosh.  Very delicious, and nice flavor.  Cucumber and radish kimchi salad.  Only a little bit tasting like kimchi, more like a sweet daikon radish.  I like this a lot and would recommend it in a heart beat.   Beignets with a mango sauce.  The cook (owner?) brought these out to us just so that we could try them.  I didn't even see them on the menu but they were delicious.  A nice sweet sauce.   Ambiance is a bit dinerish but it's clean and well lit.  A really different and delicious meal with very gracious and kind owners who were more than happy to help guide two people who had no idea what they were doing through the foods of Guam.  A really great experience.",

Chicken was perfectly cooked and not dry.   Frank, the owner, works hard and takes pride in his restaurant. I had a chance to talk to him a bit on the first visit and he was very gracious.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is simple and no frills. It's good for families and big groups since there's a good amount of seating. It's first come first serve though. For my purposes, I prefer to order ahead of time and pick it up. The restaurant gets busy and I've stood in line for too long once when I had some slow, slow customers in front of me making decisions at the counter.",

I came back to the hotel to a spam musubi, breaded calamari (or was it fish? I can't remember) musubi, chicken kelaguen, red rice and cucumber finadene.  Ok so I know I said I had just eaten but the food smelled so good I had to take a bite. That bite led to more bites and then I somehow I ended up finishing his food. Oops! It was that good... The red rice, chicken kelaguen and the cucumber complimented each other really well! The citrus flavors of the kelaguen plus the soy sauce/vinegar flavors of the finadene really brought out the subtle flavor of the red rice. I'm salivating just thinking of it.

There are normally about three workers there every time that I have visited.  The do offer a 10% military discount.  All the workers are very friendly.  It is a small restaurant, but it does the job.  I will never visit another restaurant that serves the same type of food.  Once you walk in there is a menu with brief descriptions of what is actually included in the meals.  I opted to order the mini barbeque chicken red rice.  I am not a fan of macaroni salad, so I just get extra rice.  The sauce that they serve with this dish is everything.  I don't know how to describe it.  It is kind of like a soy sauce mixed with vinegar and chive mix.  It is excellent.  The mini is just enough for myself and I have a healthy appetite.  Everything is cooked to order so it takes a few minutes, but I would rather wait to get fresh food.  It's not a long wait even if they are busy  The staff is wonderful.  They are amazing, and very helpful with people who have never been there before.  They are willing to explain, and be patient with a customer who doesn't know exactly what they want.  The decor is mediocre, but again the service and food is excellent.  Everyone was extremely nice, and the food was great.  I would definitely recommend this establishment.  See pictures below.",

    "text": "Best Guamanian food in Vegas! It's a great little family owned restaurant with family made recipes! Get the Hafa Adai or Boka plate to get a taste of almost everything on the menu! I usually get the Boka plate unless I'm sharing because it's a good amount of food per plate, which is always good to take home for later!  Food is always great tasting and has never failed. They cook fresh every order, waits can be lengthy but always worth it. You can see when they pull your chicken off the grill and straight to the plate on the bed of rice.   Parking is never too crowded, it's a fairly large parking lot with a few popular businesses around like Island Sushi, but it's not a far walk at all from the back of the parking lot to the restaurant.   Staff is so family friendly, almost like you've been there already they treat you like family! Love places like this. There is also Red Rice merchandise, along with a \"Vegas Strong\" longsleeve in honor or Oct 1.   All in all, would never hesitate to recommend this spot to family and friends, they're going to be in great hands!",

I've been wanting to come here for a while now and the hype is real!!! the atmosphere is laid back and chill. its nicely decorated & it is clean too!   The food is soo good! I've never had food from Guam before and it blew me away with savory flavors! i got the bbq chicken plate which comes with red rice, potato salad and the bbq chicken! so flavorful and made to order.....the potato salad was one of the best I've ever had. the red rice  was amazingly yummy and so much flavor like no other rice I've ever had , and the bbq chicken was very tasty  and cooked perfectly! Two plates for $20 not cheap but worth it.   We also ordered desert, the Mochi donuts (topped  with cinnamon sugar) OMG soo good, freshly fried to order & they are so delicious. I highly recommend ordering that with your meal! A 4 piece order  for $3.50 is not bad at all ;-) but make sure to get a dozen because 4 is not enough lol    I will come back here for sure and i highly recommend you try it out you wont be disappointed i guarantee it.",

    "text": "Hafa Adai!!!  For those of you who are not familiar with Chamorro aka Guamanian food, think of it sort of like Hawaiian BBQ with a twist.  What you get at Hafa Adai is a tasty blend of flavors from the islands of the Pacific Ocean.  Recently discovered this gem of a restaurant.  So far I've been here twice.  Once I ordered the hafa adai plate and today I ordered the local plate.  The difference between the two plates is the hafa adai has an empanada and the local plate has 2 shrimp patties.    The chicken and pork rib are marinated then grilled.  The chicken and pork rib was good, flavorful and tender.  Tastes like some sort of soy sauce marinade with some interesting other flavors.  The empanada was good as well.  Kind of reminded me of the empanada at Pollo Campero.  Caution, this sucker is served hot!!  The shrimp patties were good, I think I perferred these over the empanada.    The red rice is very interesting.  I can't actually describe the taste or flavor of it, except that it is very tasty.  Yet, the taste isn't that overpowering either.  You have to try it and draw your own conclusions, there lots of umami in it.  The kimchee is nothing like what you get at a Korean place.  It is basically pickled cucumbers and pickled pickled radish.  Yes I said pickled pickled radish.  The yellow takuan is already pickled, then it is repickled with the cucumbers.  I find this side to be tasty.  The star of the show is the chicken kelaguen.  If you're familiar with Thai food, it tastes a lot like larb.  It is a cold chicken disk with a lot of sour notes.  Think of chicken with a bright citrus marinade.    The only negative is the wait time.  If you're in a rush or don't have much time, it is best to call in and order ahead.  But trust me, the wait is worth it!!",

    "text": "Clearly there is a reason why this is the spot for Guamanian food.   Hafa Adai plate YES! Comes with Chicken kelaguen (you will likely mispronounce this) which had like green and regular onions and grilled chicken and seasoning and it is tasty. It also has BBQ chicken and ribs along with the empanada. Loved the ribs.   Empanada was pretty interesting. It was reminiscent of a jack in the box taco with its meat and that is no insult intended cause there is a guilty pleasure with those.   Sides we got were cucumbers and extra side of rice. That red rice is bomb. They were heavy handed with some of the portions today which was great cause we were hungry.   I loved the flavors overall and the staff felt very homey even though I'm not from Guam. I don't know if I want to deviate from what I got but I am interested in other items.",

    "text": "Red Rice isn't so nice.  I was in the mood for something different (aka the usual Yelper's mindset) and it was a slow day, so my co-worker agreed to grab lunch from this Guamanian restaurant. Red Rice is located in that small strip mall on Eastern between the sprawling Sansone Park Place and whatever that plaza anchored by EoS Fitness is called. Island Sushi is the most notable neighbor, so if you remember that place for the sushi or for being the old home of Poke Express, you'll know where to go.  The menu is a bit confusing despite having been condensed from its original version. You can order a lot of courses and sides in combos, samplers, or a la carte. Still, we settled on a sprawling order to get a good feel for the menu. I thought that she wouldn't be gone long, but she texted concerns about the long wait and the seeming line skip by people who had arrived and order later but received food earlier. In the end, it was over half an hour's wait.  Despite that (or perhaps partially influenced by it), we were pretty hungry and were looking forward to a good meal. If it had been satisfying, I would have certainly forgiven those service issues.  If you want to try this place, I'd focus on the Chicken Kelaguen, preferably in something like the Hafa Adai Plate ($14.25) combo meal rather than in the Kelaguen Sampler ($13.95). More on my objection to that later, but the larb-esque diced chicken preparation feels fresh, chews tender, and doesn't taste too sour. Also, get the Potato Salad ($2.75) in a plate or as a lone side. It's rich and packed with flavor, but doesn't seem especially fatty.  As for other relatively enjoyable items, the rest of the Hafa Adai Plate was solid. BBQ Chicken isn't awesome alone but works well with the orange-red sauce on the side. The pork rib wasn't that tender throughout, but I like pork a lot. The Cucumber Fina Denne' is a lightly picked salad full of crisp cucumber slices, and it lifted the rest of the combo. Both the empanadas and shrimp patties (present in combos or as separate sides) tasted pretty good, although both have fillings which seemed too carb-focused.  Also, I think I could suggest the dessert which we tried, the Chamorro Beignet ($3.50). It did hit the spot when enjoyed hot and fresh. Although it wasn't very fluffy and I couldn't discern mango as the specific fruity element of the sauce, I liked the crispy exterior and the restrained sweetness.  Delving into the forgettable foods now, I didn't find the red rice to be special at all and could have had any other carb substituted in. Well, except for the Coconut Titiyas ($3.25); those tasted like sweeter versions of pita bread and weren't worth the special premium (since they're not in any combos or plates). Also, the Breaded Shrimp ($5.95 as part of a \"nene\" size plate) was fine, but it could've easily been taken out of a food service frozen bag and prepped.  The worst offender of the meal was the Beef Kelaguen component of that Kelaguen Sampler. The shrimp was fine aside from lacking the herbs and punch of a more typical ceviche, but this beef was full of almost inedibly touch slices and was too sour throughout. I struggled with it for way too long and only finished because I really wanted the protein. If they'd used a better beef cut or sliced what they had much more thinly, it might've worked, but what we had was borderline disastrous.  By the way, the prices are high if not outright ridiculous for the portions. I'm absolutely certain that I could have gotten more bang for my buck at reliable and delicious nearby alternatives including Hawaiian and Thai restaurants.  I was going to keep my rating at a 3, but even that seems high upon further reflection. I have no loyalty, sympathy, or other reason to be nice to Red Rice. They've been in business for a while, but what we ate and how much we paid for it today suggests that they've lost sight of what made them a Yelp darling. It's maybe a 2.5, rounded down.",

Ordered a Local plate which came with red rice, BBQ chicken, one BBQ pork spare rib, chicken kelaguen, two shrimp patties, and another side which I got the red rice as well.  So the verdict is  Red rice - Good flavor, soft, and love it. BBQ chicken - Not as juicy or flavorful as I thought it would be BBQ Spare Rib - a bit dry and tough to bite on Chicken kelaguen - This is almost like Laotian larb, and can taste the lime flavor  Shrimp patties - Mostly soft breading filled with bits of corn, chopped carrot and peas. Some shrimps inside but mostly grounded up. Can definitely taste the shrimp flavor.   Being $15 for Local plate which isn't cheap but I expect better flavor and BBQ.   At least I can say I have tried Chamorro food!",

I have never tried Guamanian food and I have a lot of family that lives in Guam, so I was super excited to finally get a chance to see what this little island has to offer. Boy was I impressed! The musubi's are the best I have ever eaten and I have consumed a lot of musubi's. I have always eaten musubi's w spam, so when I tried the shrimp musubi I wasn't expecting it to be better than spam musubi, but it was.  I'm actually disappointed with myself that I have never tried Guamanian food prior to this visit. If you're nearby and you want delicious comfort food, this is definitely the place. The food is so in depth and you can taste the love put into what they serve you. Red Rice definitely wants you to remember a piece of their culture and it will be hard to forget. We had these shrimp patties/balls, I can't remember the name, but I remember eating it and thinking to myself... I can just eat this with their red rice haha.  The restaurant is small and walking in I honestly didn't expect that the food would be what it was, but until next time I visit Vegas I'll have to day dream about the food here. Their menu is not huge, the prices are affordable and the staff is incredible. Now I wanna visit more Guamanian restaurants because of Red Rice.",

So that was stuck in my mind since I know next to nothing about Guam and most importantly its food.  Found this place on Yelp and had fantastic reviews. Was very intrigued about the style of food so had to try one of everything. Had a ton of leftovers but was well worth it.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of were the empanadas, wasn't filled with meat and was deep fried. The rest of grub was fantastic! Loved the meats that had heavy citrus notes and really added to the flavor.  Wish we had a Guam restaurant in Utah, would be all over it!  For sure will be back when in town, their web site appears to be down so hope everything is okay.",

The traffic lights were out for blocks. But the owners were so nice and welcoming. They offered us drinks and apologized profusely. We had a great conversation with them, reminiscing about the island and the culture. It was like talking with Relatives at the fiesta. Next time we are in town we are visiting first thing!!   Still give them 5 Stars. Was back in Vegas and needed food for a large group at the last minute. I called around 12pm and asked if they could complete my order by 7:00 pm. They said they could and when I arrived to pick it up, it was all ready! My family & I loved everything!!! We missed Guamanian food so much. Will definitely return the next time we're in town.",

I had checked out the menu ahead of time so I already knew what I was getting, the shrimp plate with potato salad. I waited less than 10 minutes for my food, and was on my way. I made a stop on my way home and am happy to report that the food was still warm when I got home.  I really enjoyed everything. The shrimp was just simple breaded shrimp, but it was cooked well and the dipping sauce was delicious. The potato salad was super yummy as well as the rice. I definitely can't wait to go back to try some of the other menu items.",

The restaurant is located in a strip mall off of Eastern Avenue, south of I-215. There is ample parking spaces, and plenty more around the side. The lot shares parking to other food businesses. As you walk in, you are blasted with the aroma of goodness, and it has that family get together vibe. You will immediately be greeted with \"Hafa Adai\" The restaurant is Guamanian island food.  I scanned the overhead menu and zoomed in on the Locals Plate (BBQ pork, BBQ Beef, chicken kelaguen, Shrimp patty, and red rice).  I also got an extra order of the Chicken Kelaguen...(diced chicken with onions and bomb seasoning: lemony) it's what I came here for. The flavors didn't disappoint and was so perfect.   So if you are in the mood for some Island love, you definitely have to put this place on your bucket list.",

Right when we walk in, the tables were pretty full.   The man at the cashier asked if this is our first time trying Guam food and gave us free samples of their food and explain what we're in it, which I thought was very kind.   It's not a sit-down restaurant, so you just order your food at the cashier and they will bring it to you.   The size of the plates are big. I would say 1 fiesta plate could feed 2 people.   The plates are priced $8-$12, which I thought was reasonable.   I'll definitely come again to try the other food they have to offer.   What to order for first timers: Fiesta plate=4/5 Chicken plate=5/5 Spam musubi=5/5  The only thing I don't like about the plates are the salads do not have enough dressings.",

    "text": "Hafa Adai! Was looking for a place to eat dinner and found Red Rice on Yelp. I have never had Guam (Guaminian?) food so this was a first and didn't know what to expect. The place is located in a small plaza next to other larger plazas. I am not from Vegas so I relied on Google Maps to find this place as well. The place has a handful of booths and a larger table near the front. Looks like it is family-owned where the family is bringing their culture and food to the Vegas. I ordered the Fiesta Plate and an order of the Red Rice Musubi. The Fiesta Plate has a little of everything. BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, a rib, an eggroll (lumpia?), some type of minced pork, and marinated cucumbers over a bed of red rice. The meats were OK. The beef was really tough. The chicken was kind of fatty. The rib was OK...Of the meats, I enjoyed the marinated minced pork. It reminded me of what you would call larb at a Thai restaurant. The rice is made with achote seed to get the color and flavor. I felt the rice was overcooked and was a bit mushy for my liking. The achote seed is supposed to provide color and a hint of flavor and that was correct. The color looked great and it looked like it would pack a punch but it didn't have much flavor. For $14, it was enough food for 2 people who aren't extremely hungry. As for the red rice musubi, the rice again felt a bit mushi. The spam was fried and marinated in a sweet sauce. There was some sort of sauce in the middle which added some moisture to the seaweed and spam. It, like the Fiesta Plate, was OK. Nothing too special. The red rice didn't add much other than making it look more appetizing.  The meal was OK. The service was friendly and helpful but in all, the whole experience was just OK because of the food. Remember to check in for a free fountain drink. I might come back to try the other dishes but I wasn't particularly impressed by the meal...",

    "text": "Hafa Adai... I love Guamanian cooking and was pleased to hear another Chamorro restaurant had opened along Eastern. I really loved the other Guamanian restaurant that was in the area a few years ago. I even became friends with one of the owners even though I was an out of towner. Sadly it closed up shop a while back and I've been missing the cooking ever since.   We flew in from the Los Angeles area on the first flight of a rain soaked Las Vegas morning. We got there a little after they opened and was stuck on the menu for a little while before we were approached by a young man for our order. I had the hafa adai plate which came with bbq chicken, bbq spare rib, empanada, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina dene and that red rice ($11.95). It was a huge meal. A tasty one at that. The red rice was great. There was plenty of it. The bbq chicken was good. I liked it. The bbq spare rib was very good. I could have another of those easily. The empanada was so good. It was different from what I typically know as an empanada. It was deep fried and was filled with tasty, stewed meat. The chicken kelaguen is cooked in lemon juice and coconut milk. It's served cold. The fact that it was cold took me a while to get used to but the flavors are good. It has a very strong flavor. I loved the cucumber fina dene. I could eat that every day. So good. Pickled cucmber deliciousness. This plate is big and can easily be shared by 2 people. I recommend it.  I loved the red rice musubi ($2.95). It comes with red rice, furikake, daikon, spam of course and a spicy sauce. It was so good. Loved the taste combination and red rice in a musubi?!? My mind was blown. It took spam musubis to another level.   We also ordered a breaded shrimp plate ($8.75) which came with 2 scoops of red rice and potato salad. And as a treat to our friends that were stuck at Bellagio with their kids and couldnt make it to Red Rice, we brought them all back red rice musubis. They loved it. Even my godsons ate them up. So the red rice musubis were definitely a hit.  In eating at Red Rice, I felt at home and that's a big a compliment I can give any place that serves any type of islander cuisine whether it be Filipino, Hawaiian or Chamorro cooking. They play island reggae and that is the type of music I want to hear when I'm eating that kind of food... I also met the owner, the patriarch of the family. He was very gracious and we had a good conversation. He told me how he loved cooking and grilling for family and friends and the choice was made to try and make it a business. He said that everyone in the family had a hand in the restaurant and I have to respect that. I wished him and the business much success and told him I would spread the word and make sure to stop by every time I'm in town.... Gotta have that Red Rice!",

Food: Got the combo plate with an extra side of empanada. The rice, ribs, and chicken were averagely typical. I love the kelaguen because unlike most, theirs wasn't loaded with onions. The empanadas were cooked just right. I like them moist inside and crunchy outside.  We got to meet the owner. A very hospitable man.  This will be one place we'll stop by when we're in the area.",

My fiance grew up in Guam before relocating back to the United States, so he missed having island food. But our excitement came to end...  We ordered:  1 Fiesta Plate Combo and 1 Hafa Adai Plate Combo...  -The red rice was way too oily. It was also missing the green onions in it - everyone makes it differently but adding some green onions, bacon bits, and green peas to it makes it real Guamanian (Chomorro) food.  -The BBQ chicken on both plates were dried. - The empanada was burnt - the shell was too hard and had a burnt taste to it.  -The cucumber Fina Dene was missing the diakon (Diago). - The chicken kelaguen was dried, where was the coconut in this?  -The one piece of rib on each plate was good.  - The shrimp pattie was too dark in color on the outside but when opened it looks undercooked.  -The red rice musubi, was disgusting. I don't see what the hype is regarding the musubi..  -Fina Dene was plain, no flavor. You can taste the soy sauce more than anything in this. -The red pepper sauce (Donne dinanche) was also plain. We thought it would be spicy, but turned out plain, no spicy to it.   Overall, our food was OK. Not the best, but just OK. One star for bringing the culture to vegas and one star for the decorations and friendliness. Wished we could've had a better experience, but hopefully with time, they can improve their food service. Thank you Red Rice for serving us.",

This fast casual environment is very islander with all the Chamorro decor and islander music with a good variety of different food from the island of Guam.  Although a little on the expensive side, there is hardly a price to steep for good Chamorro food.  Varieties of islander bbq, kelaguen, lots of different Chamorro sides.   I ordered the fiesta combo plate consisting of Chamorro BBQ ribs, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, shrimp patty, Lumpia, chicken kelaguen, cucumber salad, and of course red rice.  I only recommend the Fiesta Plate or Hafa Adai Plate if you want a small sample of each item.  After tasting sample of each item I wanted to order a whole order of that item!My favorites were the bbq ribs and chicken, chicken kelaguen and the Red Rice was delicious(a must for Chamorro food).

    "text": "Too expensive, small portions, and dry meat are the 3 main reasons for the 1-star rating. I don't usually write reviews, but the $30 I spent here was such a waste that I instantly had to write one. I've eaten Chamorro food before when the first Chamorro restaurant opened up on Eastern Avenue several years ago. Their food was so delicious. Sadly, they kept increasing their prices and giving less food, which probably led to their demise.   So I spent $30 buying 2 Fiesta plates, but it felt like a big ripoff.  The red rice, cucumber salad, lumpia egg roll, kelaguen chicken, and shrimp fritter were ok. I'm more upset about the meat that they gave me. The BBQ chicken was very dry. It was tasty, but I wish they used chicken thighs instead so it wouldn't be so dried up. Additionally, you would think paying $13.50 for a plate you would get more than just 7 tiny 2-inch strips of chicken. They didn't have BBQ beef so I got an extra BBQ pork rib, which were super dry. It didn't even taste fresh. It tasted like it was cooked from the night before.   I probably would never recommend this place nor would I ever come back. I'd rather eat Korean BBQ or a Hawaiian restaurant as their BBQ is much juicier and tastier.",

    "text": "Sweet tatiyas, red rice masubi, octopus and chicken kelaguen, bbq, and a bottle of King Car for the road...yes I am in HEAVEN!    The husband and I shared the Fiesta plate, which included bbq, chicken kelaguen, lumpia, and shrimp patty.  My only complaints was the beef.  I thought it was a bit too dry but everything else was delicious.  I like my kelaguen with a good amount of tang and a kick of spice and they nailed it.  Not only the chicken but the octopus kelaguen as well.    The red rice musubi definitely got my attention.  I never had red rice musubi with daigo so I was excited to try it.  It was definitely not the musubi I'm used to but definitely one I recommend.  The spicy sauce gave it a good kick.  Just thinking about it is making my mouth water and wanting more.  The sweet coconut tatiyas were nothing short of amazing.  My 13 year old and I love this stuff.  I must say, one of the best I've had so far.    Not only is the food great, but the service was amazing.  The staff were so friendly and nice.  The owner (at least I think he was) even came out and gave my husband some denanche, which he has been wanting forever.    I'm looking forward to my next to trip to Vegas for another round of Red Rice.",

The inside of the restaurant is small and cozy, decorated to a tee, I love the idea that you can buy some novelty and snacks for the road.   This is my first time trying the food and I actually liked it, it was different and had some pretty good flavors.  My absolute favorite was there musbi, there's was different than your usual one, they integrated it with the red rice.  I wasn't too sure about trying these bad boys, but I am glad I did, they are now my favorite and I don't think I could eat another plain one.  So they totally got me on that!  I love the beignets, they were not too doughy and had the right texture, the Mango drizzle made them ever tastier, I found myself eating and eating till they were all gone, I would suggest ordering more then one if you have to share. They're other selections were good, I really liked the empanada, it was pretty good, the filling was tasty and the masa they used made them a perfect texture, I definitely wished I had more than one.  I do wanna come back and try more of there dishes! They seem to take pride in there restaurant, food and customers. I over heard one of the employees saying they clean up every day and make sure to do a monthly deep cleaning, and they come in everyday at 10am to start prepping and cooking when customers come I .  So they really take pride in there business and customers.",

    "text": "We came here for an informal dinner with friends on the recommendation of another friend who really liked it. On walking in, we ran into an immigrant from Guam who assured us that the food served here is authentic and excellent. The restaurant is located in a very small strip mall just north of the BJ's shopping center ( very easy to miss). The restaurant itself is a very small storefront. About 40% of the restaurant is an open kitchen. The rest is occupied by about 7 tables. Being first timers, my wife went with the locals plate. I went with the kelaguen sampler. The locals plate had a serving of barbecue chicken, a barbecue pork spare rib, a portion of chicken kelaguen, fried shrimp patties, and a serving of red rice. My kelaguen sampler had chicken beef and octopus kelaguen with a serving of red rice. Despite the fact that we told them we were eating in the restaurant, all of the food came in take-out boxes. Not the ideal presentation. Kelaguen is prepared by\"cooking\" the meat in a lemon preparation and it is served cold. I discovered that I am not a fan of kelaguen. The octopus tasted Bland and chewy. The beef was okay for cold beef ( also a bit on the chewy side). And the chicken was also fairly Bland and flavorless. My wife's local sampler was the better of the two dishes. The pork spare rib was tasty although had very little meat on it. The barbecue chicken was okay. The fried shrimp balls  were very tasty and very enjoyable. And she also did not care for the chicken kelaguen that came in her dish. On the positive side, each of us really enjoyed the red rice. It may not be fair to give only three stars since this may be a matter of my not liking kelaguen rather than being a problem with the way it was prepared. But I know I will not be coming back to give it another try",

    "text": "Talk about totally WELL earned five stars! It not often do five stars but without doubt everything about my first experience at Red Rice hit point for me. The thing is always wanted to try Red Rice because thinking Guamanian food like ???? Not only because never been to Guam but have no idea the dishes that would define that culture. Always enjoy checking new places and more so different ethic food. Like said not sure can truly say this is True Guam food cause never had it or been to that country. OMG. The food at Red Rice is off the charts just amazing. I barely even take the menu with one visit.   On my first visit had the Hafa Adai Plate. It basically like mixed plate with three different types of proteins and just lot of good stuff. The way they serve the food all in to go containers reminds me of comfort food from another island the 808. Once you open the to go nothing the same but only the best Guamanian food I eve had in life. The BBQ Chicken and Pork Spare Ribs. Both grilled to perfection, nice char marks on both, perfect moist and hot on the inside. The seasonings not sure words give it justice but not traditional BBQ flavors. The Empanada, Red Rice, Chicken Kelaguen, and Cucumber Salad. I am sure that about as True Guamanian food. The Empanada was again perfect golden brown, crispy, and the filling hot. The Red Rice not sure they get the color but love the rice. Someone that lives for white rice this is another form of rice that could eat everyday. They even use that in there spam musubi!!! The Chicken Kelaguen never had cold chicken salad like that before, It pretty much all chicken. It refreshing side dish along with cucumber salad. The cucumber salad the seasoning on top is something that different then other cucumber salads. It not often every component in dish especially one with lot of parts going on. I rave about each one. Solid.  I also ordered the Chamorro Beignet. It not at all the normal Beignet thinking getting at the french quarter. It lot more heavy, not fluffy, flat different size shapes, and the sauce they drench over it. They top it off with some powder sugar. Caution since heavy one order is lot of dessert.  I enjoy it. I had no expectations cause Guam and Beignet. It would order it again.  The portions are ridiculous and really reminds me lot like plate lunches. The prices are similar very reasonable for anything on the menu.   The service is five stars through and through...I was talking with the dad or maybe grandfather. You can tell totally family own business. The son or nephew was taking the orders and serving you. The dad or grandfather cooking came out asking me about the food. Next thing knowing asking him about the style, asking where I was from, how did I hear about this place, and just all the things tend to forgot the mom and pop family run businesses. He even asked me if like spicy and brought over some spicy hot sauce to try.   The only thing that keep me from getting here is the hours. They close pretty early. The gentlemen talking to was saying that they were planning on expanding the hours. I love hearing that cause then can get me more Guamanian food! Not sure if more Guamanian food places around Vegas but I would start with Red Rice for SURE!!!!!",

We had the Hafa Adai plate, the Beef Kelaguen, Lumpia, Empanadas, Coconut Tatiyas, and Banana Donuts! The staff was friendly and food was delicious. Everything was made to order and brought out super hot. The food took a little while but was well worth the wait. We aren't local to Vegas but will definitely be back when we visit again! Thank you for the delicious food!!",

The short story is that my mom works for a bank based in Guam and most of her coworkers are Guamanian. Every company get together when I was a kid featured red rice, chicken kelaguen, and lumpia.   If you've never had Guamanian food, the fiesta plate pretty much gives you a taste of everything that the cuisine has to offer. The red rice is a staple, and even is in the red rice spam musubi. The BBQ chicken and pork spare rib are great, and I love the small shrimp patty fritter. Guamanian lumpia are much larger than the Filipino ones that most are accustomed to and you get one larger piece. While the rice and chicken kelaguen tastes bland on its own, everything is enhanced when you drizzle the vinegar sauce over the entire plate, which I recommend.   While slightly more expensive for island-style food, I loved that Red Rice took me back to my childhood.",

I tell you what, it was a fiesta of flavors in my mouth. The meats were cooked to perfection (the ribs are not a meat-falling off the bone type, nor is it meant to be. Just a few bites in, you can really taste the thoughtfulness in preparation of everything down to the red rice that just has this beautiful glow. It \"looks\" like Mexican rice but it's not - it has a very savory exotic taste to it. The lumpia was fried perfectly. And then there's the shrimp patty.. omg, my only complaint is that there was only one! The chicken kelaguen was definitely new to me - I would best describe it as a shredded chicken ceviche. The fiesta plate really lives up to its name, give it a try!",

    "text": "I first heard of Guamanian food from Diners Drive-ins and Dives. It looked good so I looked to Yelp to see if there were any Guamanian restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. That led me to Red Rice.  Being unfamiliar with Guamanian food I did not know what to order. The gentleman taking my order was good enough to guide me through by showing me the Hafa Adai plate. BBQ chicken, a pork spare rib, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina denne, an empanada and red rice. I've said it before but it is worth repeating, if you don't know what to order order it all. That is what I did with the Hafa Adai plate.  It took about 15 minutes to get my food today. It was brought to my table in a styrofoam clamshell box as if to go. This is standard at Red Rice. I opened it up and was greeted by much more food than I had expected. The front compartment was packed full of dense red rice which was topped with the BBQ chicken, empanada and spare rib. The back two smaller compartments had the cucumbers and chicken kelaguen.   I tried the BBQ chicken first. I was so pleased to taste the smoky char right up front. I've had a lot of similar BBQ chicken from Hawaiian places that just came up short. This was delicious and probably my favorite piece of this Guamanian puzzle. Next I tried the kelaguen. I was confused by it at first. Grilled chicken chopped small, mixed with green onion and served cold. It was insanely herbatious with a sour note in the background and a little spice. I wasn't sure if I was enjoying it at first but the more I ate the more I enjoyed. The rib was next. I don't typically like ribs but this was good. Not fall-off-the-bone tender but not difficult to pull off the bone with a little tug. It had the same char foward flavor as the chicken. Not a bad thing. As far as ribs go, I'd eat that again. The cucumbers were cold and crisp. Quite refreshing. I'm not sure what the dressing was but it was a little salty. Soy sauce and rice vinegar maybe? The empanada was sadly my least favorite item today. I don't know what it was stuffed with. I couldn't quite place it. The shell was over cooked. It was very crunchy and dry like a taco shell. I used the dipping sauce for the meats (soy sauce and vinegar like pot sticker sauce) to moisten the breading. That helped. Finally, the red rice. The restaurants name sake. It is cooked with achiote which gives it the red color. One could almost mistake the rice for Spanish style given the color and even the taste to an extent. But this rice is different. It has a very earthy quality. A natural sweet nutty taste. I eat a lot of rice and I've had some good variations. This was wholly unique and now one of my favorites.  I was told before I ordered that Guamanian food was similar to Hawaiian and Filipino food. I was told that some people say it is a fusion of the two. I was told it was just simply \"Guam food.\" Having now tried it, I understand. There are some similarities but all the islands from which the comparisons draw are in the same ocean. Similarities are bound to occur. This is a different kind of food. And in the Las Vegas Valley it is coming from this little restaurant on Eastern. It is served by a friendly staff who tells you about the food and talks to you about you. Like a neighborhood joint in a very large neighborhood. I'll be coming back for sure.",

We arrived about 30 minutes before closing so there weren't very many people there. This allowed us to talk with one of the owners who was super friendly. She made us feel like we were over at her house having dinner.   The food was authentic and we loved it. I liked their spin on the musubi -- they use red rice instead of white (they don't serve white rice at all). It also had a spicy kick to it. The red rice itself was good. The beef and chicken were tender and flavorful. I ordered a side of daigo, which is pickled diakon radish. I just love the crunchiness, the brightness from the pickling, and the spiciness, which wasn't too much.   We tried a couple desserts that aren't typically Chamorro (not that I know of). The Chamorro beignets could have been a little more pillowy but I did like the mango sauce. The mochi donuts were pretty good. They were coated in cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar; I preferred the cinnamon sugar.   If we lived closer, we'd definitely be regulars.",

The red rice makes it unique, and it also has furikake flakes and pickled daikon to give it more tang than your usual spam musubi. I wish the rice was spicier, but it does have an adequate kick to it. I also tried their BBQ chicken plate, chicken kelaguen, and coconut titiyas. The coconut titiyas were like a hybrid between naan and pita bread with a coconut flavor, and it was even more delicious with the butter spread all over it. Mmmmm. The BBQ chicken was flavorful, but the chicken kelaguen was too citrusy in my opinion.   If I'm ever in the area, I will definitely get my hands on those red rice Spam musubis again.",

It's not like the traditional one but that's what makes it so good.  Everything had so much flavor.  Red rice.  The way the cook the spam. The additional sauce and stuff.  It is a little on the spicy side. And it tastes like it's made with so much love.  The combo plate was ok. The chicken and the ribs were a little dry and the Kelaguen is not for me.  Maybe I just don't care for minced chicken. And the pickled cucumber thing isn't for me either.  Both are probably good (they are flavorful) just not my thing. The lumpia and the empanada were both really good.  and of course the RED RICE IS SO GOOD.  Oh and so is the brown sauce they have at the counter.  I'd go back for the spam musubi, lumpia, and empanada.  And if there's any question just how much I liked the spam musubi, I ordered 10 more to go (to share) after I finished my dinner there. I'd give the plate another shot, but maybe just the beef and get more red rice instead of the kelaguen and cucumber thing.  Super friendly service - makes you totally feel at home.  I hope I can make it back again sometime soon!",

I already was getting annoyed and then people who came after us got their food the same time as us but they only waited 10 minutes. The deserts made me feel sick after since it was fried and seemed like the oil absorbed in the dough which was sick. The spam Musubi had some kind of mayo hot sauce thing in it with the spicy rice.

The red rice makes it stand out from any other I've had before.   So why 3? The main course. The chicken is well done and juicy but, for the price, there's a lot of other better options for grilled chicken and rice. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it, but it's not a must eat place.

We were a little hesitant to go the 2nd time around because their lack of acknowledgement and appreciation as we walked in and throughout our dining experience, but we decided to give it another chance, the benefit of the doubt.. and sure enough, we were not greeted coming in. She looked up at us and continued to do what she was doing for a bit of time & mind you we were the only ones in there except for one other who was already eating their food. We were confused.. were they closed? Did she not see us? And just at the last second as I was about to turn to my husband and ask him to go somewhere else, she comes up and asks us what do we want to order. Whatever the case may be, It would've been nice for her to let us know that she'll be right with us. The food was still bomb though.. it satisfied our cravings.

It also had chicken kelaguen which is chopped up grilled chicken flavored with citrus, onions, and peppers. It is a huge plate for someone like me, but it may not be enough to split 50/50 with someone.   The red rice musubi is like musubi on crack. It features their signature red rice, luncheon meat, daikon, furikake, and a yummy sauce.   The titiyas are like a tortilla/pita type bread. I've tried both the coconut and the corn. I really like the coconut titiyas, which compliment the chicken kelaguen well.   I really want to try their desserts like: fried mochi and rosketti cookies.   My only complaint is the early closing time. Multiple times I've stopped by and forgot they close at 7 PM.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 41/100",

I live in CA and my grandparents live in Vegas, so every time we visit we ALWAYS make a stop here to support the fam! We usually order the \"Hafa Adai\" plates with the \"Boca plates\" for the kids to share (because there's so much food inside). This is probably the most filling place to eat where my kids won't waste the food. The red rice is on point and the empanadas are PHENOMENAL and are a personal favorite of mine! I also looooove the Guam rosketti! If you are looking for amazing bbq, definitely go here! The hospitality was great as well and they stayed open a little past closing so our family could finish eating, which was very nice. I will be returning as always!",

For the fiesta plate you get red rice (Guamanian style rice) with bbq beef, pork spare ribs, shrimp patties, lumpia, chicken kelaguen and a cucumber salad. The price is reasonable for what you get although I would want it to be a tad bit cheaper. This is the only Chamorro food here in Las Vegas so it does remind me a lot of my childhood days when I used to live in Guam. They are pretty consistent with the taste of their bbq, the red rice and their famous chicken kelaguen. Only wish is if they can open another location possibly closer to where I live since I'm way up in NW Las Vegas. Other than that I would recommend this place to people who likes to try new things or have cravings for island style bbq food.",

But, whatevas, we wanted to eat. We ordered the plates with red rice, barbecued chicken and ribs, chicken kelaquen (Fiesta Platter?) and a side order of Empanadas. ALL of the food was very BLAND.

    "text": "I'm a chamaole from Saipan. Y'all know what chamaole means aka Half-cas. Anyway, I was raised on Saipan--and, you know, we Saipanese go to Guam a lot. Anyway, I can make Kelaguen and bbq; but who has time with the mainland pace of life? I only make it on special occasions.   When I go home to Saipan, my mom takes me out to Japanese and fancy restaurants bc she thinks I've become too American to still like chamorro food. Hello! I love chamorro food and miss the BBQs, fiestas and parties back home. So, I heard about this place and finally had the chance to give it a try.  First and foremost, my heart skipped a beat when I saw latiya on the menu. Why? Because that's pretty much my favorite chamorro dessert EVER. Next is bunelos, but they call it \"banana donuts.\" I get it, we're in the mainland. So, what did I do? Oh, I just ordered both of course! And, wow. Best latiyas I EVER had in my life. No really, if you can make an IV filled with your latiya and hook me up, I'm there lol.  And, don't tell my mom but your banana bunelos is better than hers. Again, don't tell her. What about bunelos munga (mango)? Maybe in the future? That's my other favorite bunelos flavor. What about potu? :) I know, I know--gotta focus on the core menu items. Don't want to overload it.   I ordered the fiesta plate and the rib plate. I loved the red rice, very flavorful and perfect consistency for me. The fina dene was good, but could use a tad bit more lemon IMHO. That's just my preference, so I added it myself. No biggie. I eat chicken all the time so, I didn't love the chicken--I did like it though. Maybe I wanted it with skin? But, the ribs? Oh, the ribs. Gimme gimme more, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. I LOVE the ribs. Tender, falls off the bone, marinated perfectly. Just like home.   So, yeah, 4/5. I would hang out there, but I don't want to overstay my welcome. Anyway, if you see me, I'm so fair skinned you would think I'm just another haole--not a chamaole. So, it was fun acting like I didn't know anything lol.  But, the food hit the spot.   I didn't try the spam musubi, but apparently it's everyone's fave. And I have to try the tatiyas, I do love tatiyas with butter. That's what we eat for breakfast in Saipan with chamorro sausage, eggs, etc... So, that will be on my list next time. I also forgot the King Car, which was my childhood drink of choice.   Everything together was MUNGGE!  In the words of the Arnold, \"I'll be back!\"",

This was my first time ordering from Red Rice even though I had been eyeing them for sometime. I ordered through Uber Eats and man oh man when my food arrived I was excited. The tamales were something I'd never seem before. Different in texture and taste but SO DELICIOUS. I also ordered the Adai plate. I will say this there food was so good I literally called just to thank them. They also got my order completely correct and put everything that I asked for and labeled it nicely (sauces,napkins, ect.) all in all a great experience from this place and o will be ordering from them in the future. My tastebuds are going crazy right now! I'm so impressed! You can tell this food was made with love!",

    "text": "The family that owns & runs this business is from Guam.  Seems to be a mom & pop that run the kitchen and their two sons run the front of the house. One of the sons took my order and helped me understand the menu, food, Guam and even a bit about their business after a few of my prying questions. I could tell this guy had customer service skills and could hold an engaging conversation. It didn't take long for the food to come out but it did seem to be made to order. I got the beef plate for just under $9. It came with sliced beef, red rice, diced chicken and a little salad on the side. The one son had explained to me that their food was savory rather than sweet, which you might find in similar cuisine (I know practically nothing about Guam food/culture).   The beef was smokey and bit dry, so I added the sauce as he recommended and it was tasty. The diced chicken had a nice amount of spice to it with a bit of citrus that complimented it well. The rice ironically was my least favorite part of the dish.....but the salad. This salad was a few slices of cucumber and few leaves of lettuce with a REALLY good dressing. I literally was searching the menu to see if I could just order a salad but I didn't see one, that's how much I liked this dressing. The customer service here was very good; even the back of house was interacting with customers. It was clean and brightly decorated and the food was solid. Although I liked the food and I'll be back to try their rib plate for sure, I give it four stars because the food didn't blow me away but it was very good.",

I was not a fan of the cucumbers or the other stuff (I'm not saying it was nasty it just wasn't something I prefer for my taste buds). The spam masubi was amazing. I'm still disappointed in the fact I didn't order some to go. The guys was also helpful and did not rush us into ordering. I will definitely be back especially for the spam masubi.",

There were Chamorro videos and pictures of landmarks in Guam placed throughout the restaurant, as well as island music playing on the stereo. The wait wasn't long, but the woman behind the counter kindly offered some mochi donuts to us for free while we waited for our food. I ordered the Hafa Adai Plate and that comes with BBQ ribs, kelaguen, empanadas, salad, red rice which goes for around $11. The plates are a good size and I was fully satisfied! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is either from the Marianas or would like to try Marianas cuisine",

    "text": "Note to owner: you stated there was a promo purpose and no ladies with blonde hair work there, my brother in law follows you on IG & there was a point you had young blonde hair ladies in the place. That being said maybe after your promo someone's hair stayed in the kitchen area ? which got into the food. So that does explain that!  Admitting you use lemon POWDER & real lemon means your employees will take the lazy way with the powder if needed which I can tell you is never the same as REAL fresh squeezed lemons. No matter which powder you use, squeeze it it's the best way you can tell the difference. As an ex-chef from GUAM I was able to right away, especially with the watery kelaguen.  Tatiyas are suppose to be round, enough said. Again lazy way is cutting it any shapes. Advice: get a cookie cutter makes it so much faster & perfectly shape.  The coconut issue is part of the kelaguen recipe & as long as you guys took to make our food 30-45 minutes. Someone could of kamyu it then , added the coconut to the kelaguen. You can't worry about leaving an important part of the recipe out because it spoils fast, this is the food industry & everything should be made fresh every day. Don't tell me you save for days ? That's not good!  As for the gas grills then that explains that NO SMOKE CHARCOAL FLAVOR in the meats! But totally understand you have to follow all rules for the building. But of course when you say GUAMANIAN food we expect island style. That starts with the Charcoal bbq like from back in the islands at any family event or bbq gathering.   I see you didn't have anything to say on the red rice ? It's probably because I'm sure that it's not living up to the name as I seen in other reviews. Like I stated we found uncooked & hard pieces in our plates, not just mine.  Last complaint: the timing for orders is not appropriate 30-45 minutes all I can say is put yourself in the customers shoes ? Then think if you will ever want to go back.   I hope your restaurant the best. I know it's a hard business but these few easy things can be brain stormed. We want to come support our culture & respect what you are doing but with any chamorro you know there is always good & bad reviews. We hope in a year or sooner things will get easier and better. As my family & I would love to come back. Focus more on the restaurant and not your reviews because answering to all the reviews is not necessary at all. Everyone will always have an opinion & this is mines!",

We went for lunch and there was a pretty good amount of people already sitting in the restaurant.  Ordered the Fiesta Plate and the Beef Plate.     The Fiesta Plate is the way to go if you want to try a bit of everything.  And it was awesome!  Especially the red rice!  That was my favorite!  The empanadas looked good also but we'll save that for next time.  The only reason I couldn't give them the full 5 stars is due to the wait.  After we ordered, it must have taken close to 25 minutes for our food to come out.  And it didn't look like anyone was really hustling in the kitchen.  Hopefully this is just due to the place being really new. :)  I'd come back, but we'd definitely call ahead to place our order.",

We hadn't had much luck in our food choices and this seemed just as good as any other. So glad we did! I am not even going to attempt to spell the food but the chicken items were so flavorful and unexpected. My friend was so glad we decided to try it as he was getting grumpy from the flavorless food we had been running into. The owner was nice and even gave us some sweet items gratis. The portions were large so we had enough to take back to the hotel for a snack. If you are feeling like something different, this is the place.",

My favorite of all time of Chamorro food is chicken kelaguen. The flavor is outstanding! When I went I ordered the chicken plate which consisted of BBQ chicken, chicken kelaguen, red rice, salad and finadene. Seriously they give you like half a scoop of chicken kelaguen!! That was the smallest portion ever!! I was very disappointed And tastey??? Not so much... I've had waaaaaay better!! The BBQ chicken was just okay... Nothing special.   I had ordered my daughter a chicken Nene (small/mini) plate. Tell me why my daughter had more chicken in her Nene plate than I had in my regular size plate. Not only that.... The friend I went with ordered the chicken plate too... Why did she get 3 regular size BBQ chickens in her plate and I got two small pieces?? Very inconsistent!!!!   Also on their menu they offer white rice.... But don't ask because they don't have any. Wasn't sure my daughter would like the red rice so I attempted to order her white rice and got shot down. They don't serve it. Also don't ask for a fountain drink because their machine doesn't work. WTH!?   Okay my last complaint... The guy at the register was still on a stool!!! Sitting on the stool and leaning with one arm/elbow on the counter as he was taking people's orders... Don't know about you... But that's very unprofessional to me. I've never been to a restaurant where a worker was sitting on a stool and not only that leaning all over the counter like he was bored.  I lied... One more complaint... The service... Takes forever! I should have timed it. But we waited a pretty lengthy time before getting our food.   Will I return? It wouldn't be my choice... But if my friends wanted to go id go again. Other than that? No I wouldn't.",
