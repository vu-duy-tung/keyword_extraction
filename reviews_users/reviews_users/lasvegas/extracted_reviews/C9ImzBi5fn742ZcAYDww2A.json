Kids loved the pot of bread. I recommend the corned beef hash extra crispy. The french press coffee a plus!   Take the family. U won't be disappointed. Ask for Lisa. Just the sweetest waitress ever. The pjs are a cute touch.",

After looking at the photos on yelp and reading the reviews I had already made up in my mind that I wanted their chicken and waffles, but once I was seated and saw how small the waffles were, I asked if I could have pancakes and waffles instead; and indeed did I make a good choice.  Those where the most fluffy, soft, and flavorful pancakes I've ever tasted.  The chicken on the other hand, could've used a bit more seasoning but overall, I enjoyed the food and the service.",

Conveniently located right down the street from his house, yummy food, and waitresses in PJ's make it worth the sometimes short-ish wait.  I'd for sure give it 5 stars, but I sometimes want a bloody mary or mimosa with my breakfast....especially on an early morning, after a late night...but alas. There is no booze to be had.  The coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice has to get me by, and they do so pretty well, being super delish.  Service is always awesome. Sometimes I think I'll wear my jammies to fit in, but I always forget.  Next time!",

The waiter came to take the order and instead of seeing if we had any questions with the menu she kept asking if we needed more time like she was in a hurry to walk away. We did so she walked away and went chatting with another employee, I turned over and she was eating fries from a table nearby. What really blows my mind is that a couple walked 20 minutes before closing and she made it a point to mention to them twice that they were closing shortly and would have to order soon. Not only that but before that couple walked in she made a comment to the other female employee about the couple walking in. Needless to say they left without ordering. Again another couple walks in and she again makes a comment. They sit and she makes it a point to let them know they were closing soon. I asked for a tea refill as I was finishing my food and tells me that they are running out and will check what they have left. She then walks over with a full pitcher. The food was decent but the slaw lacked salt and is not comparable to replace fries. I would not recommend this place based on this experience. I hope this does not fall on deaf ears.",

Unbelievable!!!! Belgium waffle the thickness of about 2 pancakes was $8.00 and to add maybe HALF a banana was $2.00. Omelette was $8.50 and to make it with egg whites and add bell peppers was $5.00!!!!! And the bell peppers were MISSING and there was very little egg. Babies food was 1 pancake, 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $6.00. Not bad. That's about average. Again, the food is amazing. But the price is WAY to much for the little that you get. Will drive all the way to Jamm's for something almost as good and A LOT more food for a reasonable price (even with paying for gas we will be ahead of the game).",

Nonetheless, this brief and short interaction wasn't pleasant.   I ordered chicken and waffles - both were bland. The chicken was a breast filet that desperately needed seasoning. The waffle although is a waffle, was nothing special either. Hey at least it wasn't eggo frozen waffle right? Ugh. I also had the breakfast plate of biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs and hash browns. Again, nothing special. The gravy was almost too salty and the hashbrowns were just meh.   These 2 dishes were just MEHHHH!    This place is overpriced and overrated. That lady needs attitude improvement (not necessarily everyone's service since this was a take out order I wouldn't know the general service). Go back to bed crabs!

It's fairly pricey for someone like me but it's worth every cent. The omelet plate comes decorated with orange slices just for fun. The juices are bomb with a slice of fruit of whatever juice you ordered hanging on the side.  I love that they don't bother you while you dining by asking every second \"are you okay?\" Just because there is a line (unlike most places I have been). Eat your fill and take the rest to go.

The food was overpriced though and honestly not as good as Ihop omelettes and hashbrowns. Eggs seemed a little overcooked and not as seasoned and fluffy as Id like and not enough cheese in the  omelette. The cup o bread is unique and like a fluffy fresh baked tiny bread roll with frosting to dip it in. I recommend it. Servers were nice and got us everything we needed.

If you have the time to give up than I suggest.",

She introduced us to menu items we loved, she spoke affectionately and passionately about her love for her job and her employer and her employees seem to respect, love and value her and the large team of employees were happy and seemed to work in harmony. Not something you often see in restaurant operations. She is a jewel and should be cloned!! and promoted!  The quality of the food is excellent, the presentation is wonderful and the portion is big and the \"bread in a cup\" is DIVINE. My girls wanted to keep ordering the \"bread in a cup\" - a wonderful sweet roll with a decadent cream cheese concoction on the side and I finally had to cut off the number of bread in a cup orders they wanted to eat!  The restaurant is spotless, with colorful and fun decorations and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an excellent meal, impeccable service and happy employees that don't roll their eyes when you receive the fifth cup of coffee so you can wash down too many to talk about bread in a cup orders!",

The steak was alright and the eggs were, well....eggs. You get a choice of toast, biscuit or a cinnamon roll in a mug (bomb). I was a fan of their coffee and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice.",

Went today ordered eggs over easy bacon and hash browns. Eggs came crispy had to return them, bacon looked cooked but wasn't and the hash browns were greasy over crispy.  The cost for this and coffee 17.00!!!! Never will eat here again.  Better food from McDonald's for 5.00",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very bright and relaxed. We loved how the servers were all in their PJs! Our waitress Halle was very sweet and energetic, and made our experience that much better.  Their fresh orange juice is definitely recommended, and their \"dinnamon\" rolls (a mix of cinnamon roll and dinner roll) were amazing. I personally got the smoked salmon eggs benedict which came with hashbrowns and was topped with hollandaise and capers, and was very happy with the food. My fiance got the buffalo fried chicken with eggs and hashbrowns, and couldn't finish all the chicken since there was just so much! All in all we both were happy with what we got, and definitely plan to come back next time we're in town.  Hopefully next time I won't accidentally forget my sunglasses!",

It's a good distance from where I live, but why not drive a little to get a great breakfast, and that's just what happened.  I like it so much when menus are posted online and I had already chosen the breakfast I was going to get.  When it came time to order, I took my server's recommendation and ordered the rib eye steak chilaquiles.  I chose the pot of bread instead of toast or biscuit.  The bread was good, but I wish it had more cinnamon.  That would have made it and outstanding breakfast accompaniment.  The main action was the spice rubbed rib eye steak--there was a small amount of rub flavoring--and it was done rare just the way I ordered it.  For the eggs, I got over easy which was put on top of the refried beans and chips of the chilaquiles.  The cotija cheese added so much flavor!  The eggs were topped with sliced avocado.  Very nice presentation.  My server, sorry I didn't note the name, was quite good.  The restaurant is not large and when I was leaving around 9:30, there was a wait for tables.  I think I'll go back sometime and get my original choice and compare the two!  I am glad I gave Rise & Shine a try!",

Besides the appearance and feeling you get being in there comes the food! When going through the pics on here everything g looks good so here is what we found out..... EVERYTHING IS AMAZING AND FRESH AND MOUTHWATERING!!!!! From basic eggs, hash browns to the chicken and waffles and fresh squeezed oj. You got to save room for the bread in a cup thing which should be eaten first or maybe have the waitress wait to bring it out so it's super warm and more amazing. But yes love this place and will be coming here every time we stop in Vegas.  Oh yeah wait time for party of two was a minute if that so don't worry it's worth it.

The ribeye was cooked perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were to dance for. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   The potted bread was the only item left to sample but came until the end which actually worked out great since it comes with a cream cheese glaze we treated this as dessert",

Also, they removed my favorite lunch combo (soup and southwestern chicken salad) They no longer have the soup and salad combo and they no longer have the Onion Soup or the Southwestern Chicken salad. They also removed the delicious Pot of Bread from (at the very least) the Chicken and Waffle.  You simply shouldn't remove items that accompanied entrees in the past. If you want to remove an entree fine but removing an accompanying item gives a bad experience.   I will not be frequenting this place as I did before.  We used to go almost every weekend and there's zero loyalty, they simply wouldn't budge and wouldn't allow me to order a soup and salad. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.    This is is exactly how businesses fail. Poor management.",

    "text": "I come here rarely when I absolutely refuse to make my own eggs. I have eaten here several times, but the most recent one to date... I ordered a special egg white omelet with specific ingredients. I came about 35 minutes after I ordered the food. I was fine to eat the food... But they had thrown it away and offered to just make a new one no charge. I was very appreciative..(I just always have a fear of cooks doing something to the food in orders like these.) but I accepted and it was quite delicious. Maybe a little runny. But sizzling hot and I guess as good and as exciting as an egg white omelet can get....   One thing I'd like to note... I know it's 'their thing' to run around in their PJs. All the servers etc... But when I come in there sometimes it looks really messy. I see people in their PJs. 3 tables that still haven't been bussed and crumbs everywhere. Just something they might want to take note to. Also, the cooks and servers are always shouting to one another from across the room... Because the cooks station is open to the restaurant. (You'd understand this layout I'm mentioning if you've actually eaten here).    BUT.... It you are in the area, they have consistently good breakfast food and always seem to be pretty busy. All servers I've ever had have been nice... Some of the hostesses make me nervous... Like I have to be reallyyyyy nice to them because they're having an 'off' day. I know we all know what I'm talking about here. K hope everyone else enjoys !!",

The second time I got the Chicken Fried Steak. Now, they are known for their steak and eggs so I would stick with that. My sister got the omelette which just seemed like any average omelette. My mother got the waffle which was soft and tasty.But the Chicken Fried Steak was THE BEST and the gravy was amazing. I was in heaven.They also serve illy and French Press coffee.

Looked this place up on Yelp for favorite bfast spots and saw all the great reviews. All I can say is I am glad we stopped in. This place is tucked into a strip mall which I could care less about. The scenery inside is very eclectic and relaxing. I was more excited about the food!My only suggestion is if you come on a Sunday is come early...we had to wait about 30 mins for a table which was ok because we were not in a hurry. Once seated we ere greeted by a very friendly waitress who suggested a hot pot of french press coffee for the table which was delicious! The menu is packed full of great selections, but they specialize in steak so I decided to get the steak house omelet. It was pretty good, but not the best steak I have had so not judging it off the Ruth's Chris steak quality. My daughter ordered this 2 fisted bagel sandwich filled full of eggs, bacon, ham and homemade sausage and it was killer! I was overall very impressed by this restaurant and most importantly the exceptional service. All the waitresses wear pajamas which my daughters thought were fun. I will definitely be back to this place when in Vegas time permitting....",

Our waitress was nice, but did not write down our requests, so as a result got a lot of our items wrong. We had five people with somewhat specific requests, so it is better to write it down. Usually they do at restaurants I go to. We did not want to send back our items as it would take even longer to get the right items.  The restaurant is not too fancy. Not too new. Reminds me of a Denny's. The price isn't great either, same as strip prices just about. I thought going off the strip is supposed to be cheaper. Their most unique item is the bread in a cup. It's bread baked into a cup. That was really good. Fluffy and flavorful.  I got the omelette with fruit, avocados, and hash browns. Nothing special. Just a regular breakfast. Won't return. Will stick to the strip next time. Closer and cleaner!",

Burger was great... cooked perfectly, tasty and hard to finish. Fries were crispy and season perfectly.  I've eaten burgers all over town, including on the strip.  This burger is now toward the very top of the list.   Only negative? $30 (plus tip) for a kids meal, an order of pancakes and a burger.",

All of the wait staff are in their pajamas, and everyone was super friendly.    I was happy that they had enough healthy and vegan items to select from the menu.  I just had the Go Go Greens Juice, a fruit plate, and potato hash.  They were all delicious.  I could have ordered oatmeal but decided to go with the potato hash for my carbs in the morning.  My husband had the eggs and corned beef hash with sourdough toast, and he enjoyed his meal.  I would come back here again if I am in town.  It is in a quiet neighborhood, and it is very close to the 15 S Freeway south of the busy city of Las Vegas.  Lovely place.",

If you never had Chilaquiles it's like breakfast nachos! Chips dipped in ranchero sauce, carne Asada, cheese, avocado and eggs however you want them (drooling...) it was so delicious!! Everyone at our table had an amazing meal, the portions were great and it was close to the hotel we were staying at (Southpoint) only 2 miles. I highly recommend this place, if we ever go back to Vegas this is on our \"must eat at\" list",

Pros:  Friendly & Accomodating staff Eggs were perfectly cooked as what I said Cup o bread was so good I ate my cousin's cup o bread Hashbrown was great My steak was perfect  Cons:  There's a long waiting line even we went there around 11AM The my cousin's steak was burnt on the outer layer almost to the point that it was unedible When I was going to the toilet I saw their kitchen it was so dirty  Tips:  Call them before heading there and maybe have a reservation. Always check the food when the server is giving out the food.",

Whimsical decor and fun waitstaff. We ordered the pot of bread as recommended and were not disappointed. Just the right serving size in its little teacup.   Someone else suggested the corned beef hash and eggs. Not my go to breakfast but I haven't had it in a long time so I gave it a try. So so good.  Our waitress Cary was delightful and attentive, always filling our glasses even half full.   We will definitely be back",

I've been wanting to try this place out for like six years and FINALLY just got to try it today. I wish I tried it sooner ! There was no wait when we came in this morning too.  They have an extensive menu and everything sounded so good for breakfast but I finally settled with their crunchy cinnamon french toast. They have the BEST french toast in town ! And I'm not just saying that because I came in starving lol. I really enjoyed their variation of french toast. It wasn't too sweet either. It's a must try. I also ordered my french toast w/ egg whites and turkey sausage and my friend shared some of his hash browns. Loved every single part of my meal. One of their other highlights is their pot of bread. Presentation is cute , it comes in a small mug. It's like a cinnamon roll and you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is). It's also served w/ butter on the side but it's that good on it's own so it doesn't need it.   Love the theme they got going on too - they have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling and all the servers wore PJs. I would love to come back here again if it wasn't so far from my house. If they could open another location in Henderson that would be perfect :)",

I loved the umbrellas on the ceiling. Very unique and adorable. That's the only thing I could say I actually liked.   The service was the worst I've ever had and I mean worst!!! As soon as we were greeted by the server (christine) we felt her negative vibe. You could tell she didn't want to be there. She even rolled her eyes and started looking around the restaurant while we were taking to her. I was really hoping my son wouldn't notice because he's super picky about customer service. As soon we'll she walked away he's like \"Did you see that\"!!! Unfortunately I did. Not once did she not ask us on how our food was. When they (her and another server) dropped our food she didn't even ask if we needed anything else. My son waited 10 minutes after our food was served to get sour cream. He tried getting her attention....She looked right at him and walked away. Finally he just got up and went to go ask the cooks for the sour cream.   The food was not worth the $44.00 we spent. I had the red velvet pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon. I specifically asked the server to make the bacon well done. Didn't happen. The pancakes were hard and crispy. Really pancakes crispy!? Ugh. My son had the steak omelette I think. He said it was ok but not worth the money.   All in all I would never go back to this establishment. The service alone killed it for us. Then to have mediocre food ugh. Honestly there's so many good places in Vegas to eat breakfast... believe me I'm a native and have been to plenty. Try somewhere else!",

He checked in on us once after food came out. We observed him helping every other server by delivering their food, etc., while we sat there for over 15 minutes with no drink refills or the check. We had to try to waive him down 3 times before he finally saw us. He then asked if we wanted refills. Maybe fifteen minutes prior yes but not when we're agitated and ready to go. He could have at least offered one to go? Not impressed. Then when I mentioned at checkout the experience wasn't great the manager just said, breakfast wasn't great this morning? When I said no the server was terrible, she just stood there, so I grabbed my receipt and left. Don't ask me unless you are going to make a point to try to fix it. Took too long to even recover the issue. Won't see us back anytime soon. Many more options.",

As we entered the establishment, we were greeted with a welcoming smile and presence from the hostess.  We immediately sat in a comfortable booth.  Noticed that all the servers were in pajamas and thought that was really cool and different.    We then browsed through the menu and were quickly welcomed by Desire! We could tell she knew it was our first time there and simply made it a breeze with the menu and picked out her favorite items on the menu as well as some favorites from previous guest(s) she had.  So we started off with the \"Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast\" and we both had our own teacup muffin thingy which was absolutely freakin' amazing.  Shortly after we had our main items which were the \"Philly-Style Cheese Steak & Eggs\" and \"Fancy Steakhouse Omelette\" which were just out of this world phenomenal.  As time went on, her section was full but she made each and every table she had her priority and that the guest(s) needs were met at %.  We eat at a lot of place and both were in the service industry and she by far was one of the best servers we've ever had.  Overall the experience there was impeccable from the welcoming of the host staff to our service by Desire and our food presentation.  Thank you again very much \"Rise & Shine!\"  We will be back!",

Tortilla chips are just right, nice and crisp. Not soggy at all. Just enough toppings. The steak comes on the side. The steak is good by it self but I personally cut about half of it and put the steak pieces over the chilaquiles. I would say I've had it about 3 times and each time is just as good.   Each I've been there the service has been pretty quick and the people working there have been nice. The staff wears pjs which is kind of cool. I do have to agree with another reviewer that the fans should be dusted but its not a deal breaker for me (:",

    "text": "Update: They raised the prices which is unbelievable considering very few items are made from scratch. It's all add water mixes for the pancakes and the egg whites are from a container not separated eggs. The omelette was over cooked to make matters worse. I'm so over this place especially since my two favorite servers have left. The remaining staff seems miserable and it makes one wonder why. On to other places for us.   My husband and I frequent Rise n Shine at this location. Our first experience was made phenomenal by our server, Christine! We love her and request her whenever we go. She is very attentive and professional. I think the prices are high but I don't mind paying a bit more for the great service we receive from Christine. I can't imagine anyone feeling a negative vibe from her, she is always cheerful and funny.  I love the waffles! The caramel coffee is delicious and I don't have to order when I go in, Christine knows what I'm ordering. Lol. Go on in and ask for her!!",

The meat was cooked just right (med-rare), even the fat just dissolved in my mouth. The chilaquiles themselves were just crunchy enough and not soggy at all.

    "text": "Thought I'd check out the \"New Place\" in our neighborhood. Always anxious to find a good Breakfast Place especially one so close. Being close was the only Good thing about Rise & Shine, Valle Verde Location.  I realize flavor is a personal thing, so I shouldn't complain about how things tasted. I had ordered the Two Eggs, over medium, Hash browns, Sausage, and the 'Cup of Bread'. The two eggs were perfect. The Hash Browns were more than the normal hash browns. They had \"spruced\" them up with spices and the texture felt like they were \"Freeze Dried-'just add water' and heat\". There wasn't any \"skillet type\"  items on the menu so I created my own. I also asked for a side of Gravy, noticing they had 'Biscuits & Gravy' was on the menu. The 'Banger\" sausage had a good flavor, but it is not a breakfast sausage, in my opinion. The Gravy was flavorless, except for the black pepper. The 'Cup of Bread\" was too doughy and the \"dipping sauce\" wasn't very tasty.  I usually eat less than half of my meal, taking leftovers home for a future meal or snack. So, I realize that the waitress may have thought I wasn't quite done, but it took her a very long time to see if I was done, and if there'd be anything else.  She  dropped off the bill and said \"I can take that up for you, but take your time\". Placing my credit card on the bill, I feel, indicates I'm ready to pay. I waited at least 15 more minutes, with different wait staff passing me by  numerous times. I was NEVER asked if I needed a \"BOX to GO\" and if there may be something I didn't like about the meal, due to the amount I hadn't finished. Like I said previously, taste is a personal thing,and I wasn't going to take this breakfast home for later. So, I just got up and went to the front reception desk, and paid my bill. One good thing I noticed was that the Wait Staff was dressed in Pajamas. I thought that was very clever. But, I won't be going back, just to see the pajamas.",

And not surprisingly, both steaks were very well done. We're usually not ones to complain, but when our server came by to ask how the food was... well, we brought it up and she offered to have the kitchen cook up another steak. So okay, cool.  Sadly the next steak she brought out was even more well done than the original. How that was even possible, who knows. She offered another time to have another steak cooked up medium.   How it was possible who knows, but each steak brought out was progressively cooked more and more well done.  There was absolutely no hint of pink in the middle or the sides or anywhere for that matter. The server was getting exasperated herself and kept apologizing profusely, and we didn't blame her at all. It wasn't her fault. But even after all that, the most they could do was take 15% off our bill.  That was a little disappointing. They failed to deliver an edible steak, and it felt like the fair thing would be to take one of the steak&egg orders off the bill. Especially when it was their kitchen staff's fault for messing up so badly, four different times. We didn't think it was a fair gesture, but we weren't going to make a big fuss over it. We're simply not ever going to return to this location.    Sad because we enjoyed the first couple visits here.",

The french press coffee was outstanding and reasonably priced. For the chicken n waffles, they used a chicken breast that is scalloped meaning, cut in half but still connected which gave it some size and helped it cook quicker. It was crispy and well cooked. The waffle was nice but kinda soft, and that is something common for most the waffles in town. I like the  crispy style waffles at Bread and Butter or Bouchon. But solid place",

As soon as we got seated the waiter seemed as if she was in a rush, but the place was no where near busy. She took our orders, but never let us finish speaking because she kept interrupting us; again feeling \"rushed.\" She gave us our food and asked what else we needed, and she forgot our utensils, in which she basically threw them onto our table; once again, rushing! The prices were way too high for the quality. I ordered a steak and it was not juicy, it was bland when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend ordered a southern style chicken fried steak and it did not taste like anything. The breading was horrible too. Paid almost $50 for just the two of us. Would not recommend this place.",

If u are not a fan of spice be careful, it's loaded with Jalapenos. we did get a kick out of the waitresses wearing PJ's. All the staff was very friendly. The one thing I did find quite funny was the POS system that was mounted on the wall... It's mounted so awkwardly high.! Hahahah",

We have been bringing visitors to Rise & Shine telling them what a \"great place\" it is. Unfortunately, our experiences of late have not been great. The service has slowed considerably. Drinks are empty before refills are offered. Butter or syrup come well after the meal is served. The food is room temperature and the portions have diminished. Tomatoes are yellow and scarce in a dish, eggs are dry and overlooked, toast is barely brown. The fruit waffles are just a plain waffle with fruit in a cup on the side. There are a lot of restaurant options for Southern Highlands area. It is disappointing that Rise & Shine isn't maintaining the original level of service & quality needed to keep my patronage.",

The kitchen is open air , so with the radio blasting, cooks singing along to the music, and the constant shuffle of the plates and silverware it's a bit noisy.  Distracting from the nice quiet breakfast we were expecting.   I ordered the Steak/Spinach Benedict and she ordered the Ham and egg Benedict  My plate has a good sized portion, but once I cut into the steak I find its mostly gristle and fat. The hash-browns were good.    The Ham and egg Benedict was missing hollandaise, and the  aged-balsamic sauce.  Requested from our waitress and promptly received.   Probably will not be returning to dine again, the noise was a big factor.",

    "text": "This is THE BEST kept secret in Las Vegas. Almost debated on reviewing, so I could be selfish and KEEP it a secret, but it was so good, I have to give the owners props.   Here are all the reasons this place deserves MORE than 5 stars.  - Came at 10am on a Saturday and everyone was friendly. We actually had no wait, but I think that was more luck :) But it's still a positive in my book. - Bread in a Pot. Delicious cinnamon swirled bread that was soft and buttery. Almost like a croissant... warm and came with whipped butter and strawberry jam. TO DIE FOR!!! - My Man got the filet wrapped in bacon with eggs - cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, and you could tell it wasn't just cooked properly but that this place orders high quality ingredients. - I got the chicken fried steak and eggs, and WHOA, the outside was cooked so crispy, and flavorful. Had a little spice kick to it which made it even better. Eggs cooked perfectly.  - The side of potatoes were seasoned like an expect would. Not too salty, full of flavor. I don't like ketchup, and at other places I always end up with bland hash browns that need flavor and ketchup is the obvious choice but these tasted excellent plain. TWO thumbs up!! - They serve illy coffee, and it is so good. Much better than typical diner coffee. It was refilled without me asking - another thumbs up! - The server was friendly and cheery but not TOO cheery if you know what I mean  - 3/4 through our meal, the owner stopped by. I think this is what tipped the review. He was friendly, and I LOOOOOOVE when someone in charge stops by your table. They should come by when things are good and bad, and not just when there is a customer complaint. He truly wanted to see how everything was, and it was very personable. Obviously we raved about the place to him, and I can't say enough what a great first impression it gave us. - My man is an executive chef, and even he said this is the best place we have EVER had breakfast (totally exceeds Hash House, Egg & I, Cracked Egg, or ANY OTHER PLACE)  We will be back for sure. Our favorite thing on the weekends is to go out for breakfast, and this is definitely our new spot.",

    "text": "Originally I had a draft for this place last month.  This breakfast place in southern highlands has been great for the neighborhood.  The only other closest breakfast place in the area is the griddle on Eastern and IHOP on LV blvd.  Which is crazy busy, because of the tourists.  My original review gave this place 3 stars because the service was very bad and I'm sure it was because they were new.  We have since eaten here 4 times and I have to say that each time has been better service.  The second time we went our waitress never came back to us.  We had another waitress tell us that she would be our new waitress.  I haven't seen that other waitress working there since.  I know I'm focusing on the service on this review, but let's face it.  It's just breakfast food!  I like it because it's close to our house.   I have to say a little about the food.  I have ordered the ribeye, tenderloins with open face omlet, and the chiliques.  all of these dishes were great.  It's not steak house quality but it's also not steak house price.  My wife always orders the french toast.  She said the french toast is great because it is big texas toast and fluffy.  She makes it a platter with eggs and bacon.  One thing I enjoy about this place is I think they make their own jelly and maple syrup.  My wife also gets the freshly squeezed orange juice.  Overall this breakfast place is a must try!  be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend but at the end it's worth the wait!",

    "text": "I so want to love this place. The decor is whimsical and colorful, and the servers being in their pajamas is a fun touch, but after eating there twice, the food and the service just aren't worth the price. My first trip, about a month ago, I ordered the Ham-N-Eggs Benedict, and it was just OK. The entire dish was barely warm, the english muffin was barely toasted, the hash browns were really nothing special, and the overall dish was just mediocre. I took my friend there for her birthday today, and I was so disappointed in the food and the service that I probably won't be giving this place another chance. I figured that since they call themselves a \"steak and egg place,\" I should probably try their steak, so I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin Steak. The description on the menu on their website says it comes with \"dijon brown butter onions atop a swiss cheese open-faced omelet & hash brown potatoes\" for $13.50.  The waitress asked me how I wanted my steak cooked, and I ordered \"medium.\" The dish had not one onion on it, so I politely asked the waitress if it came with brown butter onions, and she said no. I asked her to get the menu, we looked at it together, we could both see the word onions in the description, yet she pointed to the little yellow squiggle of sauce on the omelette and said, \"that is the dijon brown butter there on the omelette.\" She then asked me if I wanted a side of onions, and I said no, and I reiterated that the description said it came with onions, yet she flat out ignored that fact. I felt like I was in Bizzaro land. I wasn't rude in any way, I just wanted what the menu described, and she acted like we were reading two different things. Seeing that I took my friend there for her birthday, I was trying to be very nice and low keyed and not draw attention, so I moved on. Next comes the bacon wrapped tenderloins. They were cooked \"well done\" and dry, even though I ordered them \"medium.\"  The potatoes were the same as before, really nothing special. They're like thick flat potato shreds with not much tasty crust, so I consider them undercooked and just not my style. So I ate a couple of bites of everything, decided it needed help, so I put some ketchup on the potatoes, hot sauce on the omelette, and A1 on the steak, but nothing helped. It just was not a good breakfast, certainly not a $13.50 breakfast, so I stopped eating at about 1/3 of the way into it. Again, not wanting to draw attention, I figured perhaps the waitress might put two and two together, see that I didn't eat much of it, and ask for some feedback, or see if I wanted anything else, but no such luck. The best thing about this place is the decor and the hope of having a delicious breakfast, but alas, 'tis not enough for me to give them yet another chance.",

    "text": "I have wanted to try this place since I saw it in the Review of the Day.  My wife and I decided to head over this past Saturday and we were not disappointed.  The Pot of Bread was delicious along with the jam and butter.  I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and my wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  The Chicken Fried Steak was big and very fried but as I told my wife, you gotta know what you're getting into when you order something called 'Chicken Fried'.  It was very good and for once my over-easy eggs were actually over-easy at a restaurant and not over-runny-raw-and-gross!  I have never been a fan of Eggs Benedict but I did my usual 'cleaning of my wife's plate' after she couldn't eat anymore.  Wow, was it good!  There was tons of ham and it was sliced perfectly!  The Hollandaise (which is the reason I don't like Eggs Benedict) was actually very good and I would even considering ordering it if I went here again.  Service was great!  Very friendly waitress/staff who seemed happy to be working.  Even though this place is a ways from our house I can say with confidence that we will go back for more!",

    "text": "As a frequent visitor of Las Vegas, I don't know how I could've possibly missed this super awesome and delicious eatery!!  My friends and I had arrived into Las Vegas, and I just just arrived from New York, while my friends were recovering from a long night, and we were clueless as to where to go for some good lunch/breakfast.  We yelped on our phones, and when we came across chicken and waffles, we thought well, could they possibly be better than Roscoes?  Well, let me tell you...  The Staff & Service  Impeccable, supremely dedicated to customers, and so friendly, I thought I was in another planet!  Seriously, everyone's smiling, and so welcoming.  Customer service is super important to me because I work in this field, and when I don't receive supreme customer service, I ain't happy!! We didn't know what to order, so we asked the nice waitress, and with her recommendations, my friends and I ordered our dishes.  She gave us enough time to order, and she was spot on with her recommendations.  To summarize this area, the word to be used is: perfect!  Rating:  5 out of 5  The Food  My friend and I ordered the original Chicken & Waffles.  Let me tell you...it's far better than Roscoe's.  The fried chicken wasn't dry--just perfect and crispy.  The waffle was delicious--no flaws for sure.  The portions were just about right--I was super hungry so I ate it all.  My other friend ordered the Rib-Eyed Chilaquiles.  The steak was juicy, and the chips that were layered beneath the steak was to die for.   The \"pot of bread\" was a first for me.  It was delicious--not too sweet like cinnamon buns, but just perfect.     Rating:  5 out of 5  Overall  I will most definitely be returning to this restaurant from now on, every time I visit Las Vegas.  This would be place for me to get a hearty breakfast without a doubt.  Rise and Shine: If y'all are reading this, thank you for your awesome and delicious meal!  You guys are awesome!!",

Both of our plates came with the Pot of bread. It was a very cute idea came with butter and cinnamon cream cheese. The bread had cinnamon swirled inside.  FYI, the coffee is on the strong side. They also had cute umbrella lights hanging from ceiling that were different flower designs. This place is quite pricey when you take into consideration that there are many great local spots nearby that are about $3 less per plate. Their normal eggs/meat/potatoes and bread plate was $10. Not somewhere we will frequent, but if we have a craving for Chicken and Waffles, this is the place.",

My boyfriend raved about his ham and cheese eggs Benedict, it came with potato hash browns on the side. The hash browns were soooo good! We also ordered the pancakes , regular ones.

    "text": "I love how cute this restaurant is. The wait staff wear pajamas and there are adorable upside down flower umbrellas that adorn the ceiling.   I've tried a few things on the menu but today I'll focus my review on the Chicken & Waffles. The batter for the Chicken comes off as really spicy and peppery (if you don't like spice it will be too much for you) and it's paired with your usual waffle. The trick though is to smother it all with the maple sauce and voila! The sweet off sets the spicy perfectly for the right amount of salty, sweet with spice.   The tables are placed really close together so if you're not into that kind of thing, this isn't the place for you. It can get really busy, especially on the weekends. The open layout leaves you to view the kitchen and the cooks like a diner so the atmosphere is really casual.   Overall, if you're in the area I'd say definitely give this place a try. They're only open for breakfast and lunch though so if you're trying to go there in the late afternoon, I'd call first because they're probably closed.",

I'm leaving this review in hopes that the owners or management will see it and bring us the great place we were used to.  Keep an eye on these employees, they aren't doing you any favors.

I ordered the cinnamon crunch French toast, it was pretty good, nothing special really. I love the warm cinnamon syrup they serve. The pot of bread is basically cinnamon bun in a cup. It got hard quickly so I kinda didn't like it. Banger sausage and hash brown were so good. I usually love my hash browns well done, crunchy, and we'll seasoned.

So you sit down and see the waitress' in pajamas-and you can't help but smile as even they are almost apologetic about the uniforms. But seriously if I could get my entire family to dress that way for breakfast I would! The menu is large and has a wide variety of items, the pop up breads in cute little pots caught my eye, when asked about them, the waitress was shocked I hadn't tried them and rushed one over to the table! It was scrumptious-as was everything else we tried!! My friend had the chicken and waffles-as I write this from my Atlanta based home-I must say it beat Gladys Knight  with an egg beater! I stuck to the basics and had pancakes, potatoes and bacon yummy! A few days later I brought my 3 year old back-and he had the steak and eggs (yes they have steak and eggs on the children's menu) and it was heaven! I love this place! And as a new vacation home owner in Southern Highlands I will be there often.",

    "text": "Ate there 4 times with only one good experience.  We ordered eggs benedict on a visit and the eggs were runny and gross.  The waitress agreed.  The Chef at that place reminds me of the Soup Nazi guy on Seinfeld.  He began to argue out loud where customers could hear with the waitress about our order. She handled it very professionally and told him that she is not there to argue with him.  This does not serve the restaurant well and made us feel that the food he prepares is his way or tough shit.  Today, we went there to give them another chance.  We ordered a Cobb Salad.  The Salad came back with FRIED chicken strips on it and should have been grilled chicken strips.  We thought, here we go again.  The Cobb salad comes back and now there are diced pieces of chicken on it (not strips as before) and much less.  We questioned why the salad did not have hard boiled egg and blue chees crumbles on it as is stated in plain english on the menu that the restaurant hands out to customers to order from.  I showed it to the waitress and she said we were right. At that point, we had been there about 1/2 hour and decided we had to leave to get back to work on time.  The waitress then takes the salad back to the Chef and the Chef says IT IS A COBB SALAD.  I told the waitress that perhaps the Chef SHOULD READ THE MENU that customers order their food from before he prepares meals.  I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and hoped the next time we went there to eat they would get it right.  Well, no such luck, this place sucks due to the Chef's attitude.  I will never go there again because of it.  I recommend that if you go there, read the menu and see if they get your order right and that you receive what you paid for.  They can't seem to for us.  A complete waste of tiime which should otherwise be a nice and enjoyable experience.  Note to Management:  GET ANOTHER CHEF.  Your currfent chef is not doing you any favors. In Fact it is because of him, we will not recommend your restaurant to others.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend just got back from Las Vegas this past weekend and tried new food spots we never did. We decided to try the Rise and Shine place that was near my friends house that lives in LV. Wait time was only 10 mins or less for us and our waitress was very helpful (which everyone seems like there). My girlfriend got the corned beef and hash (around $10), and she loved it because of its authenticity of real corned beef. I got the steak and eggs ($12) because I figured that is what they're known for. I got the medium rare steak and it was so juicy that I did not need steak sauce, only tobasco. Great portions for its price. Only downfall is that there are other steak and eggs spots in LV that are only $3.99. But I guess this is quantity and quality in the same time from my opinion.",

    "text": "This could be a 5 if not for our server, Amber.  We found this restaurant on Yelp, and with the near ease of our Navigation system, managed our way to the restaurant.  We were seated almost immediately, which was great since about 20 people showed up in the next 15 minutes or so.  After waiting far too long to be greeted at our table, I walked up and asked the hostess if there was someone assigned to our table.  She said yes, and that she would go find her.  She returned in just a couple of minutes to say that the server must be in the bathroom, and offered to get us started with coffee.  We told her that we were in a hurry to order because we were trying to get out of town and back home (who'da guessed we were in for a 6-1/2 hour traffic jam all the way back to San Diego) to our kids.  She suggested that she could take our breakfast order and get everything started until our server was able.  And she did.  Amber appeared on scene a few minutes later.  We knew it was our server, because the hostess was going over our order with her, and because we hadn't seen her before.  She was either sick or just unhappy to be there, and her demeanor when she did finally come to our table reflected that.  Her energy, or lack thereof, was the counter balance to all the other busy bees.  In fact, she even dropped one of the pots of bread on an adjacent table.  Our food was served by another server - who we are guessing was either the owner or manager.  She was extremely pleasant, and the food was delicious.  We asked Amber for our check - again, because we were trying to get out quickly - and it took her several minutes to drop it.  I was just about to go up to the hostess stand to request it when she dropped it on the table.  When she noticed I already had cash in my hand, Amber did offer to go to the register and cash it out for us.  We didn't take her up on it, but that was something.  I would have just liked to have seen some degree of service before we were on our way out the door.  This was our first trip to Las Vegas in more than 10 years, so it's unlikely that we will be going back soon.  But if we were in town again, I would absolutely return for breakfast.  The food was delicious, and with the exception of our one service experience, everyone else seemed very accommodating.",

I met Shannon, one of the servers/hostess, at another restaurant in Henderson, where I live, and she told me about this place all the way over in Southern Highlands, where she also works. It takes me a while to get there from Henderson but it's so worth it. Evey time I go in I'm greeted in a very friendly manner, unlike most places here in Vegas. She's extremely friendly and she gets me right in and takes care of my order personally. The food comes out so fast that I don't always get to sit and enjoy the atmosphere for as long as I'd like because on top of the speed at which they make it, the food is so good, I usually eat without breathing. Lol. They always keep my coffee cup full, even after I've paid my tab and they never rush me out, even though there's sometimes a line waiting to get in. It's the place I'll be having breakfast every Sunday for the rest of my stay here in Las Vegas. Great atmosphere, friendly service and fast, great food! Give it a try. You won't be dissappointed!...and feel free to wear your PJs...everyone else is. =)",

    "text": "This place was good not bad but not great I will still go to one of my favorite spots for breakfast on my days off which is MIMI'S. I live in Southern Highlands and I was hoping this place was going to be my spot when I don't feel like going to MIMI'S, but no I'll go to Rise in Shine if I don't want to drive far.When I got there it was busy and we had to wait about 45 mins. It was a Sunday so it was expected didn't mind... we waited outside because there is no place to wait inside, what I think they need to do is get some chairs outside or put a bench so people can sit while they wait. When they called us to be seated the hostess was very friendly and so was the server. But what I didn't like is that when I ordered my glass of orange juice it SUCKED and that's what the customers are looking for,especially if your eating breakfast!!!! The orange sucked because it was diluted with water to save money. It tasted just like water and the color was not even orange it looked yellow. From the moment I saw it when the server brought it to us I knew something was up. I wasn't the only person who notice that it was others too. Then what I ordered to eat was chilaquillas, I was expecting the traditional way but I was wrong, the server explained to me what it was and she explained what I thought it was going to be the traditional way. But NO it was more tortilla chip than anything else very little sauce, very very little eggs, and two slice of avocado, overal it sucked. If you never had the original chilaquillas before u wouldn't know the difference then I guess.... But I think the owner should not call it chilaquillas and call it Chips and Egg; and yes I said egg because it was only one egg.So overall to conclude my review it was OK I had better before. I hope they read this and hopefully change what I wrote just so I and others can go there for breakfast!",

Breakfast and Lunch menu are thorough - have all the classics and some great twists.  Prices are slightly above standard - but the quality of food makes up for any hesitation.  Keep in mind that this is not a tavern or pub with Video Poker and cheap eats:  rosemary potatoes, rubbed ribeye steak and eggs, fresh squeezed lemonade with agave sweetener - you get the idea.  No beer or wine - kind of a bummer for Mimosas or Bloody beers on Sundays, but I'll deal with it - it's a family joint.  No espresso, but they do offer French Press and Illy brewed coffee.  I love going there every weekend!",

    "text": "I usually wait at least  5 visits before reviewing a place because I feel like you can't get a good feel for the nuances of any dining establishment on the first time you dine with them. That being said, today was my 5th visit. So here we are, on Yelp, yelping away. I read most of the reviews here and was surprised at many of the recurring themes, most saying that food was bland or service was slow. I can say that 100% of the time, my food always arrived exceptionally flavorful with just enough seasoning. Not once did I have bland or poorly cooked food, which is awesome. I'm a righteous pain in the butt when I order, too, so I don't make it easy.   Seriously, who orders corned beef hash with medium poached eggs? This guy. And the eggs were perfect. The other times I dined here, I ordered the cinnamon crunchy french toast (I think thats the name. You'll find it), the eggs benedict, and the chicken fried steak. Let's go through these dishes one by one. The eggs benedict? It arrived with properly poached eggs, thick slices of ham (honey glazed), and crisp muffins. Topped with Balsamic, it was just phenomenal. Why has no one thought of putting balsamic on eggs benedict? Shame on you other chefs. The cinnamon crunchy french toast had large thick slices of bread, battered in a cinnamon batter, and topped with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. This, too, was a good idea. The chicken fried steak was so colossal that I couldn't finish it (and I can eat). It was everything I expected it to be. Great gravy and crust, with the right amount of seasoning on the steak. Theres only four dishes here because I had the eggs benedict twice. Which I never do when I'm prepping to review a restaurant. But I said damn the procedure and had them again anyway. Because they are just. that. good. Also, they serve illy coffee in a french press, which is amazing. If you're a coffee fan, I highly recommend going for this alone, even if you're not hungry.   The service was a bit slow on one of my visits, but by my count they looked to be short a server. I didn't inquire to see if they were, because that just seems weird and stalkerish, but even then, we were seated quickly, and maybe had to wait an extra 90 seconds for someone to get our drink order. Big deal. For a place that has food that is this fantastic, I'll wait an extra minute to get my french press.   Keep it up, Rise and Shine. You're a beacon of hope in an otherwise abysmal sea of fast food joints and generic breakfast cafes serving frozen pre-prep dishes.  I love you.",

The crispy chicken sand which was so over done to the point there was no longer any chicken in it anymore. The server brought it out any way and piled all the fixens on top in hopes I wouldn't notice. I sent it back and ordered the grilled chicken sand which instead. There was a salty sliver of chicken smothered in cheese and once again all the fixens were piled on top. The French fries weren't fries as we know them they were smothered in salt basil and lime. Yuck! It took over a half hour for my new meal to get to the table and it wasn't even busy! The owner had sat exactly two other tables since we had arrived. When the server came over to tell me my order was on it's way a half hour later I just asked for a box. She seemed shocked. I made them take my order off the total of the bill. The other people with me seemed to like their food but they all had breakfast items. All in all I will not suggest this place to anyone nor will I ever go back! Oh and I would have felt guilty feeding this to my dogs (as it would probably kill them being so salty) so I put it in the trash where belongs. YUCK!",

I have also sampled some of their omelets and they were all very tasty, yet we seem to gravitate back to what we know and enjoy. The prices are mid range and breakfast of that magnitude typically will run into $50-$60 territory. However, the staff is friendly, portions large and filling, left overs galore and we have never had any issues with our order not being filled in timely manner or long waits. I believe they have multiple locations throughout the valley but our go to location has been the one in Southern Highlands.",

Although I wish it would've came with my food, if you don't eat it soon - the air will catch it and dry it up. The sauce was yummy and not too sweet. My Steak was cooked a little over what I like but it was ok, the omelet itself was good nothing special. The hash browns though are great, crispy-seasoned and made with green onions which is rarely if not ever seen.  My hubs had the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet- dame thing as mine. What really was delicious was the Cinnamon Crusted French Toast. Omg I would go back just for that! My 1 year old had pancakes and I tasted one- better than IHOP and Denny's that's for sure. Buttery, fluffy, and a hint of vanilla. Overall I would def go back to try other items and a side of Cinnamon Crusted French Toast",

Had the steak and eggs (what else in a place called \"a steak & egg place?).   Wasn't planning on getting the best steak in the world. I knew I wasn't at Wolfgang Pucks, Chop, nor was I paying $75 either!  The steak, which the menu said was ribeye, was decent, thin but decent. Diner level. And this place feels like should be in a small diner but it's a large area in a typical strip mall.   Food was good and the service was friendly and efficient. I left happy.",

The last two time we have been a disappointment. The staff is excellent, no complaints, however the quality of the food has gone down significantly. I'm not sure if it is related to opening a new restaurant, in the same complex, or just a change in staff, however the steak omelet that I normally get was awful. Both the steak and the eggs were overcooked.   I hope the owners spend more time in the restaurant as when they were running the day-to-day, this placed rocked, now, not so much.  We won't be back, which is sad as they started out as an amazing place.",

The coffee is good, and it's $3.25 for a cup that is ostensibly bottomless, but actually ends when your check arrives and the waitress needs to check her mobile phone for extensive periods.   You can make your breakfast keto, if you'd like, and there are lots of omelet options that are great. If you need to fuel yourself on carbs, you're in heaven here, and you and your waistline will be rewarded. You can substitute carby things like has browns and their weird cup-of-bread for avocado, if you like-- or so I was allowed. Otherwise, this is a carbohydrate economy and you'll unlikely walk away for less than $10, more likely for $15-20 per person.   The coffee was pretty good.... when it arrived.",

We also got the chicken and waffles. Great juicy chicken with a crispy bread coating. Waffle was nice and soft in the inside and crispy on the outside. The syrup was warm when it arrived at our table. Overall great breakfast place and highly recommend ! Probably the best food we had in Vegas!",

I've been here during more \"peak\" brunch times 930-12 which can be such a pain and expect to wait closer to 2hrs especially on a weekend. Overall cute atmosphere, can accommodate big groups. They have a wide array of brunch items. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. However what surprised me was how good their loco moco. And of course you have to try their cup of bread. Reminds of the Lucille's biscuit. So fresh and good!",

I checked out the restroom and it's clean and  it has a slimming mirror.  Pajamas! They wear pajamas! How chill is that?   I recommend to visit this place whether you are a local, a tourist, or just hangry like I was.  I saw check out the website before you come  so you can  set your target on your food and order ASAP!  And lastly, there is a big cock by the door and I'm not talking a rude  guy either.  It's so cool!  Food is BOMB Restrooms are CLEAN Tables CLEAN Table wait time NONE Take out wait time is QUICK Mood is CHILL AF Customer service is GREAT (super friendly and huge  smiles) Ambiance Super hipster like with upside down umbrella Kitchen SUPER CLEAN  * Boomsauce scale.

Our server took forever to get to us to take our orders and when she did I had to repeat myself twice because she got kept getting my order wrong when repeating back to me.  I said \"I'll get the steak and chorizo breakfast burrito.\" And she would repeat back \"chicken burrito\".  I fiance ordered the chicken fried steak.  After that she disappeared forever.  Someone else came to bring our food and no one came to ask how we were doing.   My steak and chorizo burrito tastes off.. like it was 90% chilies and eggs so I cut through the burrito and found chicken!  After repeating myself and hearing the server repeat my correct order she still got me a chicken burrito.  She walked by us at least 4-5 times and never once looked in our direction once so we weren't able to let her know.  We got someone else's attention who notified her and she came to apologize and take my plate so she could put in an order for the right burrito. I ended up canceling it completely.  My fiance would have been done eating by the time it came. Regret coming here.  Next time I'll stick to our usual places.",

I went simple and had some oatmeal with pecans, brown sugar, milk, and raisins; the portions here are HUGE! I swear there was about 3 servings of oatmeal in my dish. My fam had the chicken and waffles, red velvet pancakes, and benedict, which they all enjoyed.

But then they top it all off with a balsamic drizzle that is tart and compliments the hollandaise sauce perfectly. It comes with a side of crispy hash browns and don't forget to try their pot of bread! Their pot of bread is a fluffy, lightly sweet, hot piece of cinnamon bread that is served with frosting.

However, I noticed immediately that the service was lacking. Everyone here seldom smiled and seemed like they didn't want to be there... Breakfast places are usually notorious for their overly friendly service but not this one. Our server, Christina, was very insincere and seemed impatient when we were indecisive about what we wanted to order. After our food came out, she didn't come back to check on us once!!  The food is edible. I ordered the corn beef hash which I didn't really consider to be real corned beef hash because it was just beef cut into small pieces. It was hard for me to want to finish.. Also, the bread in a pot that we ordered tasted kind of stale and not fresh like I expected.   I really wanted to like this place but this restaurant as a whole needs improvement",

Saw our waitress once ten minutes after we'd sat down, for a quick \"Everything okay?\" right after someone else had helped us & brought our food, & another time to bring the check. Had to ask a bust guy for a refill & some napkins. Then again I only saw 3-4 waitresses with a full house & a 10 minute wait. Did see/hear our waitress do some weird stuff at the next table. She literally picked up their kid to get him off the booth that was about to fall apart & also blew raspberries over their table before a laugh. Probably a bit of spit..it sounded gross. Anyway, good food, eh service. Maybe catch them at a better time than a Saturday afternoon.",

    "text": "Chicken and waffles?  Yes, please!  *military discount*   TL; DR version: Delicious food, quick but spotty service.    Long version:  Went on Sunday 12-27-15 around 10am.   $37.44 got us a chicken & waffle breakfast, an ultimate steak & eggs breakfast, a side of fruit for the boy, an apple juice, a coffee, and an orange juice.  I love the spinning floral umbrellas on the ceiling but they are all dusty.  It looks like they would take them down and clean them! It's quite distracting....but I liked all the servers wearing pajamas...I thought that was really cute.    THE ULTIMATE Steak & Egg breakfast comes with a ribeye steak, two eggs however you want them, hashbrowns, and your choice of bread.  My husband ate this and complained that none of it was seasoned properly, although the bites I had were delicious and my boy enjoyed the eggs a lot.  He ordered pot o' bread as his bread choice and it didn't show up until we reminded our server.  We were done eating but it was fine because it was kind of like a dessert LOL     Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffle was really good.  I never thought I'd say this about chicken but the chicken was....fluffy....it was crispy and light and airy and wonderful although it was terribly bland.  The waffle was crispy and delicious and I loved that their syrup is served warm.  I ate every single bite of this breakfast but did not leave feeling like I hate myself, which is always a good sign that the portions are properly sized.  Pro tip....pour a little cholula on your plate and dip the chicken in it!  Give that chicken some flavor!   I asked for a side of fruit for my boy ($1.95) and the waitress asked if I wanted the honeydew/canteloupe/pineapple mix or the blueberry/banana/strawberry mix and we picked the latter.  What was delivered was just bananas and strawberries so either they ran out or forgot the blueberries.   Solid breakfast place!  It is 30 minutes from my house and not worth the trip back but I thoroughly enjoyed this breakfast.",

I went in today on Mother's Day and we knew it would be crowded and we allotted for that we're sitting at a table right next to the cashier and got bumped and pushed by workers and customers the entire time.  The music was so incredibly loud that made it feel like chaos no matter what   Pancakes where not done , eggs Benedict were practically hard boiled, kids waffle tiny for price and had whip cream which in my opinion should be asked for kids menu items, coffee taste like water ... I know what you're thinking why didn't we talk to a manager... it was so loud and busy and that I didn't even feel like it was worth it to try.",

The decor is so cute, so naturally we all had to boomerang the spinning umbrellas on the ceiling :) We had to wait about 10 minutes even though they said 20, which was nice.   It was really hard to decide what to get as everything sounded SO GOOD. My friend and I got the steak & eggs and it was truly one of the best breakfast joint steaks I've had. My sister got the red velvet pancakes, and they were to die for. Pretty sure I ate half of her plate!  My only complaint was the strange service we received. Example: I ordered salsa, but it somehow ended up with my sister's side of eggs. When I asked if I could get a fresh cup of salsa, they said \"Oops, here you go\" and took it off my sister's plate and put it on to mine. Then my friend asked for a side of butter for her waffles. The waitress looks at the cup of butter on my other friend's plate and says \"but there's already butter here.\" So...we were supposed to share butter off each other's plates? This was a weird thing to say instead of just grabbing us a fresh cup of butter.   I'm hoping those were isolated incidents, so I wouldn't let it deter you from going there.",

R&S is just another addition to the ever expanding Highlands area.  You will notice the warm and friendly staff from the outset.  Its hard not to see that they are struttin' around in their PJ's, no it ain't no Loberace show, but equally thrilling..j/k.  I love theme based restaurants, Anime Ramen takes the cake though.  Anyhow, I got a kids meal steak and eggs while my patnah got the chicken fried steak.  I wasn't starvin' Marvin, but needed to get something in my stomach, pronto.  It was 10ish, so decided to keep it small.  Its still a nice portion if you ask me.  The steak was done as requested, medium rare, with fresh made hash browns served on a hot skillet.  I threw in a cup of French onion soup for good measure.  The steak was not overly seasoned which I prefer to get that True steak flavor.  The soup was piping hot and came in a stoneware cup.  Its hard to find good FOS, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Not the best I ever had like Drake kinda good, but not bad at all.  Most of the other dishes are pretty generous, unfortunately, the prices aren't.  I would suggest sharing if you are not a breakfast gorger like most of us.  The prep and way the food is served is legit though.  I like how the menu is simply one page, but it can get difficult to find certain dishes.    The ambiance is nice and quiet and spacious as well.  The inside is decorated like most new and clean breakfast joints are, yet, the twist, literally, is the ceiling fans are fitted with decorative umbrellas that accent the ceiling along with other festive colors.  Looks like Steve Wynn designed it considering the loud colors...lol.  A nice touch nonetheless.  To me, rise and shine is a hit and if you are in the neighborhood, or don't want to venture off to far if you live close by, like me, this place is as good as it gets.  Break that fast at Rise and Shine!",

My sour dough bread showed up dry and cold and my bacon was cold and greasy. This was my first and last time at this restaurant.

Huge serving (for 2 hungry people) but the meat was tender, cooked perfectly and I love their hollandaise sauce with the balsamic extract. YUM!   The spot is clean, well decorated, and I can't speak highly enough about the service. 5 stars for the service without a doubt.  I feel their menu is slightly limited and given their huge portions (a lot of meals are pretty heavy, too) I won't make this my \"go-to\" place, but I'll get a craving for it (and their cup o' bread). We'll be back!   Worth checking out (for you meat lovers only).",

The food itself was mediocre, not anything I haven't experienced already. Maybe we'll give it another shot and try something different.",

    "text": "We are new (two years) to the LV Valley, and live in the Seven Hills area of Henderson. There is no lack of restaurants in the area, so we've been doing our best to try new places we've never been before. Sadly, we have tried a few breakfast spots and none have wowed us. Until now. We finally found a decent place with good food. Rise & Shine is a bit far away in Southern Highlands, but at least it's easy traveling time, not near the strip. It's in a outdoor mini mall area with an Ace Hardware store and a supermarket. We had to go to Ace early Sunday, and decided to try the place. It was decent size and cute decor, and the servers wear their pajamas, which took a second to register at first, but cute idea. Big menu, with lots to choose from. My husband had the daily special chicken fried steak and gravy, and loved it. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and was blown away at how good it was. Even better, in my opinion, than Roscoe's in California, but I'm sure some will disagree.  The chicken breast was flattened and fried, but the flavor was rich and deep, and the batter was so crispy and flavorful. I asked, and the server said it was just salt, pepper, and flour, but it must have been dipped in buttermilk, because it really was exceptional. The waffle was light and fluffy, and their logo was stamped in the middle. The piece of chicken was huge, which was good because I took half home and ate it for breakfast the next day.  They have something called a pot of bread, which is a hybrid of a cinnamon roll stuff in a cup. We didn't try it, but will next time.  We were there at 7 am when it opened, so the crowd wasn't big, but they obviously had regular customers with whom they were really friendly.  Only downfall is that it's a bit cher...Our two meals with coffee and a hot chocolate came to about $40. So not something to do everyday, but for a nice Sunday breakfast out.",

    "text": "Maybe I missed something. Or, maybe I just ordered the wrong food but Rise & Shine was not all that to me...at all.   I arrived around 11am and it was busy. I drove here from Lake Las Vegas so when I was told the pot of breads were all gone, I was definitely disappointed.   I had some coffee to start which was actually a good cup of joe. My waitress was really busy and I was in a really patient mood so it was all good. She finally came to take our order. I ordered the Ultimate Steak breakfast which consisted steak (obviously), 2 eggs, hash browns and my choice of bread (except the pot of bread).  I ordered my steak medium but it came more well then anything. We waited about 20 minutes or more for our food so I decided to keep it. First off, this rib-eye was super thin. I have never had a rib-eye steak that was so thin.   I ordered my eggs over medium. The yolk portion was perfect but the eggs were a little too brown on the outside and they were more yolk than egg white. It was like two big eyeballs on my plate. Not sure what happened to the egg white portion.   My hashbrowns were okay but like most everything else on the plate, it was cold.   NOTE TO RESTAURANT: Why is the air up so high. My food was cold in a few minutes.  I saw some other plates going by that looked pretty good but my food was not up to par. I would say it  was okay, so I won't be back.",

I asked if I can have blueberry French toast and the server Vanessa says \"sorry we took the off the menu\" and offers something else, comes back with the food and said \"sorry that's the best I can do for you\".

I love that sort of thing, but maybe those who think it's too early for all this festive cheer may dock a star.)  Shannon our server was so sweet!!  Almost as sweet as the freshly squeezed OJ. (You have to get a glass of this stuff!!)  We ordered the biscuits and gravy, which tasted great!  The biscuits weren't too doughy, and they were covered in that quintessential Midwestern gravy.  Also had the double fisted crispy chicken bagel sandwich.  They weren't kidding when they named this thing. It was giant, with a tender piece of friend chicken, scrambled eggs, melted provolone, spinach, AND bacon!!! I got it on an everything bagel.   If you want a satisfying and flavorful breakfast off the strip, this is your place.",

    "text": "A great breakfast place with friendly service and well trained cooks.  Omelets are fantastic, and they have nice touches like a mound of cinnamon bread served in a tiny planters pot (pot of bread).  I had a spinach, bacon, and cheese omelet which was delicious.  Very well prepared and the portion was a good size.  The hash browns are well prepared and tasty.  Menu is a little on the  small side, and $2.50 for a cup of coffee is a little steep.  Expect to pay $17-$20 per person for breakfast which is a little steep.  I tried the banger sausage and found it just okay - the bacon was better.  Seems to be a hickory bacon that's well seasoned.  I can't give it 5 stars because of the price.  A limited menu is okay for me.  It's impossible to make 200 things very well, so focusing on making 20-30 things increases the quality.  Definitely worth a trip to check it out, but for my family and I, the total bill was $62.  This is a little pricey for 3 adults and a child.",

I made it a point to plan the rest of my stay in Vegas around having breakfast at Rise & Shine. My wife and I found each experience to be more enjoyable than the last.   The atmosphere is pleasant, the staff friendly and professional. You have the option of dining inside or outside. The place is patronized by many people, and you may very well have to wait to be seated, especially on the weekends. We were there when it seemed to be peak hour for business and we never waited more than 15 minutes.  The menu! It screams \"breakfast\", yet with many creative twist to otherwise conventional meals. Overall it's the perfect combination of quality and quantity. I had the Ultimate Steak Breakfast, oh so satisfying. A large ribeye steak, eggs, hash browns and choices of breads. All made to your liking of course. What really blew me away, was the Cinnamon Crunchy French Toast. My taste buds are still having a party (licking my lips).  A must try place in my opinion! It's hard to go wrong with a place that has people lined up to eat there!",

The host, hostess, and cashier are nice! The upside down spinning umbrellas are super cute! We try to get in before the lines start (after 10:00 AM). Our only complaints are there are (1) only 2 bathrooms for such a big restaurant, (2) it can get a little noisy with the radio on a high volume in the kitchen, and (3) the location of the register is a little awkward when checking out. It is right next to the door and is a combination register/hostess desk. So, when it gets busy and a line starts forming for incoming new customers and the exiting customers checking out, it gets a little hectic and jammed. They've recently expanded, and could possibly put the register and exit at the new door. This way the entrance (main door) is just for the hostess and the exiting door could be designated as the register/checking out area.",

The chicken was very very good , nice and crispy , and the waffles tasted like fluffy cake batter. It went well with the chicken. Orange juice is squeezed fresh and sweet. Not bitter at all.

    "text": "The hubby and I had a great breakfast here but I would have to agree with Michael U., a most conscientious and loquacious Yelper, that this is probably not the best breakfast in Las Vegas. Still, it's good food and very reasonably priced. And I do think it is cute that the waitresses are all in PJs... it goes with the whimsical decor.  Hubby is a huge steak and egg fan. That is his go-to breakfast order. So, it was fun for him to have some different options. He settled on the spice rubbed rib eye and he said the steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The chilaquiles were not that great, but I do give them props for making their own (some places just use store bought tortilla chips and enchilada sauce, bleh). Since we had about a 30 min wait for a table I had plenty of time to look at the menu and spent most of it deliberating between ordering French Toast or eggs. I am not a huge fan of eggs but we were about to get on the road back to Phoenix and I knew I needed some protein or else I would get hungry on the drive. Fortunately our waitress pointed out that if I ordered the French Toast I could add 2 eggs and a meat (sausage, bacon, or my choice turkey kielbasa) for only $3.50. So, that is what I did. It proved to be too much food for me but all of it was yummy so I didn't mind.  They were very short staffed that day but the service was still friendly and efficient. I would say the food was probably only 3 and a half stars but the cool atmosphere and staff rounded it up.",

There was going to be a total of 8 family members, varying in age from 23-86, so in other words, a variety of palates to please. Since we all live in town, but not all in the same area, I wanted a place that was easily accessible for those that lived further & not too far, for the senior drivers.   When I stumbled upon Rise & Shine in my Yelp search, and saw the huge quantity of great reviews, I knew, that we had to give it a shot. I knew in advance that they didn't take reservations, so I warned everybody that we could have a possible wait, a 15 minute average on the weekend mornings, I was told. Everybody, whether via phone or in person, was delightful, and the service was just as good at our table. I don't recall our server's name, but she handled our table of 8, no problem. The food was great! Almost everybody ordered something different and not one complaintThe prices were very reasonable, for the quality & quantity of food.",

I could never eat just pancakes for breakfast. I normally like to get two pancakes to eat with my breakfast,  but that is not offered here. I did, however, find out from our server that you can substitute toast for a pancake. Note that this information is not on the menu. A compromise I suppose,  but I like my eggs runny, and everyone knows that requires toast. The only other option is to order 4 or 5 pancakes.   But the biggest issue is that many employees touch the areas of dishes and silverware that you put in your mouth. For instance I've seen an employee prepare silverware settings by touching the knives on the blade part,  with bare hands. I've seen many,  many instances of a server ring up an order on the wall mounted IPad and then bring your drink to the table by holding the glass at the top where your lips go.  I have also seen servers grab toast out of the toaster and put it on the plate with bare hands. This is all done without hand washing. I would like the staff to be more aware of where their hands have been before they touch my silverware or glass and more aware of where to touch the dishes.",

We felt neglected by our server as we had to ask Passer- by servers for silverware and refills.   My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy with Hash Browns lightly cooked and they came burnt. I like crunchy and dark, but they were burnt.  She also asked for hot cocoa to be X X X HOT, came out hot,  Maybe it's a legal issue, wish they would've microwave that.   My waffle had excellent flavor just a little mushy, but the biggest disappointment of the whole meal was The pot of bread had been sitting on the shelf for a while, and we watched the server take it from the shelf to the kitchen and microwave it. You know how bread gets chewy after the microwave; that's what it tasted like!   I would've rather had it at room temperature.  Very Disappointing.   The server did without hesitation refund the money for the biscuits and gravy and the bread. I truly want to believe this was a server issue and not a restaurant issue, the problem was our Extremely high expectations.",

If we lived here it could quickly become our \"go to\" for breakfast. Thank you for a quite satisfying last meal before the long drive home!",

Cool, colorful atmosphere with employee's in their cute pajamas. I probably wouldn't mind working here just because of that.  I always get the ultimate ribeye plate with a pot of bread. Can't go wrong there at all. Their caramel iced coffee is good too.  Service is always good, but you'll definitely have a wait on weekends.

The staff was friendly and attempted to come back and check on us a couple of times but kept on forgetting what she was supposed to bring us. Our server forgot to put my order in so I received my food approximately 25 minutes after everyone had their food (which they were practically finished eating by then). Coffee / drinks were never refilled, never received our cup of bread (even though we reminded our server several times), and to top it all off the rice in my loco moco was raw! I understand that they were busy, however, they always are and that doesn't excuse raw food and incomplete orders. The manager gave us coupons for a sister restaurant as compensation but what good are those coupons if you live in a different State.",

Three of us ordered the Steak and Eggs, two of the other adults ordered Eggs Benedict and the kids got kids meal breakfast (two eggs bacon/sausage and hash browns and bread in a cup). The steak and eggs were on point along with everything else, even the coffee. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the bread in a cup was just enough sweet to complete the meal. The Eggs Benedict were also fantastic and Cooked perfectly as well. The kids breakfast, according to my kids was \"Awesome\". The relative price point for this place was definitely a present surprise. For six adults and two kids (13 & 8) for under $140.00 was a great deal for the quality and quantity of the food. The staff was attentive and on point and we did not have to ask for coffee and water refills the entire time we were there. This place is a not so hidden gem in the souther part of of Vegas. If your looking for that off the beaten path local hotspot then this is it.",

    "text": "TLDR: Great food. That's about it.  So here's the thing. I go here at least twice a month. I have for YEARS. Before, this place was 5 star hands down. If you're ordering carry-out, you'll love it. If you're dining in, it's a mess.  The area for waiting is about the size of a bathroom stall. It's crowded with people waiting to be seated, people trying to put their name in, and people waiting to pay. It's always one person handling seating, taking names, and ringing out checks. The layout is stupid to say the least and sets the employee hosting up for failure.  It'll take a bit to get a table. When you get it, it's a 50 / 50 shot it'll be wiped. They clear it and seat you and whoever escorts you to your table says \"Oh I'm so sorry\" and wipes it down half assed and in a hurry. Not because they're lazy. Because they have a million other thing they have to do.  Then you order. Food looks amazing. Coffee is always lukewarm at best. In the last few months, they've started forgetting to bring your bread choice. If you get it, it'll be cold also.  You'll wait about an hour for your food. In this time, if you don't flag someone down, you won't get a refill. I have never been told \"I'll check on your food\" or \"it'll be right out.\" They ignore you to avoid the awkwardness until they drop your food.  When you get your food, its about a 33% chance it'll be messed up in some way. They'll fix it quick, which is probably why you have to wait so long. They're always correcting mistakes. I go here with a part of 3-4 every time. Every. Single. Time. There is something missing or incorrect with someone's order. For the last year at least.  Then you eat. And holy shit balls, the food is good. It's the only reason I go back. Every time we decide to go, we literally verbally acknowledge to each other we're sacrificing a good experience for good food.  I started going about 5 years ago and it was amazing. For going on two years, this place has gotten worse and worse. There is one older blonde waitress who is a fucking pro. If you sit in her section, your drinks are refilled, your coffee is hot, and she checks in on you during your wait. If she's busy or off, best of luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.",

I ordered the Rib Eye Steak & Eggs, along with Hashbrowns and the Cup o' Bread.  Everything was very good.  The steak was decent sized for the price, and had a nice char to it.  I ordered it medium and it was cooked medium.  If I had it to do over, I would probably order it medium rare instead though.  The Cup o' Bread came with a cream cheese icing for dipping.  This was very good as well.   My wife had an Avocado Veggie Bagel with two eggs over medium on it. She said it was unique and very filling.  The Hashbrowns were good, nice and crispy.  Service was good, staff was friendly.  We will go again the next time we are in Las Vegas.",

Freash cornbeef in the cornbeef hash, eggs made as asked, sour dough bread toast was good, jellies was average, butter was great, diet soda a smidge flat, grilled steak & chorizo burrito was fantastic!!   Service: is ok, servers are super friendly,  but difficult to get your water topped off or keep your beverage cup full, They were pajamas *smile*,  fast service (not including drinks service), they give great recommendations. They are always busy helping people people or cleaning something.  Parking: lots Dinning area: inside-large, ok clean, they wipe each utensil after it's washed and dried, they clean all condiment at the end of day, a little loud, lots of talking, if you are trying do romantic, maybe sit outside (but can be windy at times). Cute flower umbrellas hanging from ceiling (some are twirling) Outside: lots of umbrella tables, big open spaces, very clean. Outside is nice.  Highly recommended for food!!

The staff was very friendly and gave great recommendations. The menu is pretty extensive so there is definitely something here for everyone and the portion sizes were generous.   I ordered a DIY omelet which was well executed but did not come with cheese automatically (my bad for not adding that to the order). Even though I didn't have the cheese, the eggs and veggies were cooked well so it didn't really matter so much. The side biscuit was really good! I definitely recommend ordering that over toast.   All in all, a great breakfast option in the Southern Highlands area. I will definitely be back!",

I ordered the sausage gravy & buttermilk biscuits with a side of banger sausages. The sausages were SO GOOD! Tried a little bit of the bread in the cup, very cute concept. On this particular day, they were having oven issues in the back, so our food took over 30 minutes to come out. However, the staff was friendly enough to serve us attentively and make sure we were satisfied with our meal.",

The Monday lunch special meatloaf comes out as a cylinder in shape and stands about 4 inches high!  I like these nuances and the kitchen's attention to detail.

Well, you learn WAY MORE when things DON'T go perfectly: This Sunday, my wife and I were seated at \"that\" table. Y'know, the mystical spot where ONE waiter thinks it's the other waiter's, and the other one thinks it's the OTHER waiter's. Consequently, we waited 10 minutes with no greeting at all, and watched later arrivals on both sides get attention while we were ignored. Right around the time we were thinking \"Let's get outta here\", the hostess (Shannon) came over, and with True concern told us that she had noticed we had been waiting, and wanted to help. She took our order herself, gave us a 2-for-1 coupon, and brought us our food herself... then she checked back TWICE during our meal to make sure everything was OK, checked us out promptly while mentioning that she recognized my wife and I as \"regulars\", and was extremely pleasant and made friendly conversation, introduced herself and asked our names, and again took great care to apologize for the delay. All I was thinking was \"WOW\". Look, I GOTTA testify, their food is good enough to treat people like dirt and still succeed - the fact that they care so much makes it a NO-BRAINER. I've  trained Customer Service for a living for over 26 years, I know what I'm looking at -  Thank you, Shannon, thank you, Rise And Shine!",

We came for brunch and asked to be seated at the barstools (since we wanted to get in and out fairly quickly) and one of the hostesses Kelly denied us and said it would be a 30 min wait. We proceeded to wait 45 minutes to an hour and nobody was ever seated in the barstools. There was an empty table for 15 minutes and we still had to wait to be seated (we needed up sitting there. Why we couldn't be seated earlier? I have no idea). All of the hostesses were rude and looked like they hated their job. The only saving grace was our extremely sweet waitress and the food, minus my husband's French fries which tasted very old. On our way out there was a couple who asked how long the wait was and the hostess responded 30-35 minutes, even though there were 5 empty tables. I would not suggest this place unless you have some time to spare. Also beware of the rude staff.",

The pot of bread with a touch of cinnamon is is offered with a spot of jam and whipped butter. A wonderful selection on their menu.

The French toast was absolutely delicious, the eggs cooked perfectly (over medium) and bacon was tasty - but limp and not crispy at all. Our food came super fast, along with the food came our check and a partial refill of my coffee that was still 2/3 full. The server never came back after that, and we sat there for at least 20 more minutes. I would've liked at least one refill of my coffee, and I kept thinking she'd come back - but never did. I hate it when they bring your check with your food, how do they know you wouldn't like something else? The guy at the counter we paid the bill to was really friendly, I expected him to ask how everything was - but he didn't. Oh well. The food was good, so I'd like to give them 4 stars, but the service left a lot to be desired. It could have been a fluke, but I'm just not sure I was blown away enough to give them another chance. There are too many other great breakfast places around to choose from.",

Staff is friendly and attentive and Management is GREAT. Towards the end of our meal Steve Bell came and introduced himself and asked us how our meal was. This restaurant has some of the best food and customer service in town, you will not be disappointed!! We will for sure be back!!!",

I can't possibly imagine how it can get any better! (Unless of course, they build one in Summerlin.)",

It makes my heart smile, I love breakfast and hate the drive all the way to \"The Cracked Egg\" all the way on Rainbow. So about the food......my new favorite is the stuffed blueberry french toast.....it was deliciously warm and very satisfying. You have to try that plate!! My boyfriend loved the steak and eggs, his words the steak was to die for!! I was very impressed with not only the food but the cute and quaint decor.......the hanging flowers from the ceiling was a nice touch and I have found my new found breakfast place and would recommend this one to everyone who is deciding or contemplating on coming in to try this place....not to mention the prices are perfectly priced for the food...great job!!",

Taste wise, the tortillas kind of tasted like I was eating Doritos, so if you're into that..and we tried the Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast, LOVED. Also, their syrup with a cinnamon stick in the bottle is awesome as well.   Second visit, California Bagel Sandwich, delish! Again huge meal. I only ate half. OH and those hash browns, sooo good. And we also got the Crunchy Cinnamon French Toast again.   Fast service even with how busy they get during \"prime\" breakfast hours. I know it's kind of strange, but the freshly squeezed orange juice is my absolute favorite part of my meal here, ha!",

    "text": "Looking for an unstuffy, fairly priced, delicious brunch off the strip on our way back to L.A. and found this kooky gem.    Decor is weird.    Sunflower umbrellas hang upside down, mosaic tiles of birds and stuff, generic diner style upholstered booths.  Waitresses in pajamas.  Weird, weird, weird but there's a line out the door at 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday, so I'm in.    We put our name on the list and proceed to wait.    There's chaos everywhere.    A waitress shouts, \"Son of a bitch\" from the beverage station, and then looks up, realizing everyone is staring at her, and then it's back to business as usual.  One patron complains to the girl at the register and there seems to be a lot of high tension.    We opt for two seats at the counter and I can't help but think of Anthony Bourdain and Kitchen Confidential as I watch these swarthy, kitchen pirates, working as fast as they can with large, sizzling grills full of pancakes, a mountain of hash browns, seared steaks and a deep fryer.  The smells are intoxicating.    We start with \"Pot of Bread.\"  This is a soft, warm, cinnamon roll baked in a demitasse cup.  Delicious!  On to the main event...it took 40 minutes to get our food and we drooled anxiously as we watched every plate come up.  I had the biscuits and gravy.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and served over an obscene pile of some of the best, chopped, hash browns I've ever eaten.  Gravy was salty and chunky and homemade.  Biscuits were soft and dense, just perfect.    Husband had the basic bacon and eggs and the generous portion of bacon was so fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked.    Then came the pancakes. Oh my goodnight nurse, this was pancake heaven!    We were just talking about some disappointing pancakes we ate at the Aria cafe the morning before.  I mean, they were fine. They were warm and sweet and sort of fluffy.  But what was missing was that extra depth of flavor and a crisp exterior.    These pancakes at Rise and Shine are almost like a donut, with a thin, crisp crunch on a perfectly golden cake.  The flavor has texture and depth from buttermilk and the syrup has a cinnamon stick in it, which just adds another nice layer of taste.  We could not get through half of our entrees but we for sure took it all home in boxes to enjoy the next day.    Next time you're heading out of Vegas, try this place. You will not be sorry!",

    "text": "I love this place! My boyfriend isn't as big of a breakfast food fan as I am, but when I told him this place is known for their steak and eggs, we knew we had to come.  There was a wait when we came on a Sunday morning. They said it would take approximately 45-50 minutes. It was 100+ degrees that day, so we killed some time at the smoothie shop next door.  When we sat down, I realized that the servers were all wearing pajamas. I love that concept!  In terms of the food we went crazy tried: 1. Crispy fried chicken breast and waffle Dark meat is generally better than white meat. However, this fried chicken breast was the best I have ever tried. The breast is absolutely moist, and the outside is super crispy. The waffle was amazing, too. It's perfectly crispy on the outside, and it's the perfect medium between sweet and savory. I love the cinnamon maple syrup, which also comes with the pot of bread, and is served heated. 2. Bacon wrapped tender steak My boyfriend got this with hash browns. It was good, but not the best. The bacon was overwhelmed the steak. I think next time he'll probably just order the ultimate steak and egg breakfast or the chicken fried NY steak. 3. Pot of bread For both of our entrees we ordered the pot of bread. It came with jam, butter, and a warm cinnamon maple syrup. It was basically a cinnamon roll, but I loved how they came freshly baked. 4. Side of corned beef hash The hash browns, while good, are 100 times better with the corned beef hash, which is one of the best corned beef hash breakfasts I have tried. It's salty, but not too much.  5. Side of country sausage gravy I typically order gravy with my chicken and waffles, so I had to try their country sausage gravy. It's good, but not necessary because the chicken and waffles is so amazing themselves.  It's my favorite breakfast place in Vegas, and probably better than most of the places I go to in the South Bay.",

They have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling that instantly put you in an amazing mood.  My favorite is their eggs Benedict with spinach instead of ham! You can also substitute shaved turkey as a option. Their food always comes out in time, and my water is literally refilled every 10 minutes. I can't complain. I will definitely try to come here as much as I can since I live about 35 minutes away from here :(",

It is kinda small and we went for brunch but I'm guessing during breakfast, you may have to wait a bit.  Of course I got the chicken and waffles...and it's one of the best versions I've had in Vegas! Even though I usually prefer bone-in breasts, they give you two huge boneless breasts that were excellent! The chicken itself is fried perfectly, crispy on the outside and super moist inside. Killer seasoning on the chicken too, it's not overly salty and even had a slight bit of spicy kick in it. The Belgian waffle was delicious, super moist, fluffy and they bring out a bunch of butter and warm syrup with the plate. My wife had the biscuits and gravy which she's normally really picky with but she loved it.  We really liked this place but I think there prices are too high. The chicken and waffles is $13 which is a huge plate but the biscuits and gravy was kinda small portion-wise and was $10. They also charge $2.50 for HALF an avocado which is ridiculous. The waitresses dressed in pajamas was a nice touch and ours was really nice. Other than pricing, we loved the food and would come back in a hearbeat!",

Immediately, from the combination of pictures and stellar reviews, I knew we HAD to have breakfast there before we left town. I ordered the chicken and waffles, the bf ordered the steak and eggs benedict, the nephew ordered the red velvet pancakes, and the FIL ordered some thing that I cannot remember for the life of me. They all knocked it out of the park!! The chicken and waffles is a must try!! I recommend everyone ordering something different and sharing because there are sooo many good things to try.   First of all, the portion are enormous. Which is wonderful because the food is so stinking good. Which is bad because if you have little to no self control like me, you cannot stop eating! Ahhh!!!  Tips: order the pot of bread. Cutest little cinnamon roll I have ever seen. Also, get there early. They are busy, so expect a wait. But let me tell you-- it is WELL worth it.",

I ordered the short stack which I didn't finish because it was more like a full stack!  They were all very attentive, never had an empty glass.  By far the nicest staff and the most delicious food!  My husband and I plan to make this place a ritual in our weekly outings!",

Everything is made fresh and the prices are fair, portions will defiantly fill you up too.  The decorations are cute also and the staff wears pajamas as there uniforms, that just adds to the overall experience of a late breakfast on a weekend haha.  I will be back again and again",

    "text": "I have been here twice, the first time it was amazing, my husband ordered the New York steak, spinach & benedict bagel and I had the country fried steak and eggs. The pot of bread was delicious! Service was great and didn't disapoint.  The second time was a different story, it was a beautiful morning so my husband and I decided to eat outside. Bad choice, it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to come and get our drink order, which by that time we already knew what we wanted to eat so we were ready to place our order, however she wasn't ready to take it. ummm...ok.... She came back with our drinks and then took our order. They were out of the pot of bread which was really dissapointing as that was one of the reasons why I wanted to go back there, my husband ordered the spiced rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles and I had the ham and eggs benedict. His order was ok, the steak was great however my eggs benedict was utterly dissapointing! One egg was poached perfectly and the other was basically a fried hard boiled egg! I have NEVER seen that before. The waitress was nice enough to take it back and bring me a brand new dish. By then it was a little too late. It wasn't just our table that had issues but other tables as well. We even witnessed one of the hostesses ask another customer who had been waiting for a table for 45 minutes if they would like to continue waiting or if they would like to leave. Why would a hostess even ask that? If they were still waiting wouldn't that mean they want to stay?  Most of the staff were wearing shirts asking customers to write a review on yelp, my husband and I were thinking that they should take those shirts off. They were not having a great day!  I may give them another try only for thier pot of bread.....",

    "text": "I thought I had a great CFS yesterday and I did, but today I had an even better one at Rise & Shine.  The steak's breaking was very flakey and light.  Not too heavy.  The gravy was served on the side with the eggs sunny up on the steak and hash browns.  The steak looked nice and crispy without the gravy smothering it.  The hash was crispy and the portions are huge.  They also serve French pressed coffee, but I brought my own Starbucks.  I think next time, I'll try their French press coffee.  They also have a thing called bread in a pot as a substitute for toast.  It's literally some bread in a flower pot.  It's combo of various breads/rolls.  I opted for the plain biscuit which was very good, but small in comparison to what you get in a bread pot.  I didn't finish my meal, so the biscuit was just fine.  The only complaint I could have is the sunny up eggs had a bit too much raw whites, but that's okay. It's just more gravy for the hash browns when mixed with the yolk.  I would rank this CFS right up there with Maple Tree.",

Second it was seasoned so perfectly every time i took a bite it honestly left my taste buds jumping for more.

The flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and tile framed windows made the setting more whimsical than industrial. The waitresses all had on pajama style uniforms which was a nice added touch. (Though I also have to mention the owner was working the cash register but didn't make much of an effort to make an impression with customers).   The food was very good - we ordered the chiliquilas and steak along with the Belgium waffles. We also got the French press coffee which is served at the table with a timer for the perfect cup.   So why only 3 stars?  This place was good but a little expensive and they charge extra for everything! In fact, a whole column of the menu has the run down on these charges... But these items arent really \"sides\" -- unless you usually eat avocado by itself?  Also, $4 for bacon?  I got my breakfast with steak for only $3 more than the chiliquilas by themselves so I'm not sure about the math on this one. Bottom line, this place is a little out of the way, nestled in a neighborhood strip mall, and could do better on the pricing for what it is... So, I have to conclude by saying this place is probably best left to the locals.",

How annoying, why would you sit a patron in the back by the service station when there's other tables available? When I worked in the service industry I would apologize to patrons for them having to sit there. So now all the traffic of running food and imputing orders is right in my face. The waitress is barking orders at the cook and complaining about her station and another server.... Very unprofessional if you ask me. Also the table that was used as the bus station was the table we sat by. Pretty disappointing to experience this when I make it a point to drive all the way here when I'm in town.

    "text": "Okay first off I am not a huge fan of breakfast foods in general.  My best friend loves it. So when a few of my friends wanted to go here for breakfast one day I was not looking forward to it. When we walked into the place it was fairly busy not overly packed. The first thing I noticed as the decor which was bright and fun with these cute umbrella flower rotating art hanging from the ceiling. It did make me feel a bit happy to be there. The next thing i noticed is the wait staff were in PJs. All and all the environment was welcoming and a cute experience.  Next the menu was full of options and i was told by my champions that all the food was good. I stepped out on a limb and ordered some breakfast items. I had a waffle, bacon, hash browns, and the potted bread. It was a lot of food but boy was it tasty. I couldn't finish it all but i enjoyed trying. The syrup is real maple syrup that is brought to the table hot with cinnamon sticks in side. The next good thing is i  tasted some of my friends corn beef hash, regular pancakes, and red velvet pancakes.  (another reason why i probably couldn't finish my food.)  Boy everything was a delight. Party for the taste buds.  Now i live in the area and highly recommend the place. If you really like breakfast foods you may fall in love with the place. If you are like me and you would pass on breakfast foods you will not be disappointed eating here. Its worth the trip if you are out and about and are in the mood for breakfast or lunch. (They are not open for dinner).  Make a day of it.",

I get the steak breakfast and it's awesome!  My picky kids like their food too!  It's a WIN for us.  We always ask for Colleen because she is totally sweet and takes the best care of us.  Did I mention that we are picky?!?!   LOL!  Can't wait to take my in-laws there when they come into town!",

I thought she had a bit of an attitude when we order water for our beverages because she walked away without saying anything to us, like she was ignoring us & not acknowledging us. But no, that's just how she was. She dropped off my fiancees bagel, I said thank you and she ignored me. Same when she dropped our food off, the check- everything. She charged us an extra $1 on our check, which we usually wouldn't complain about but we didn't have a good experience with her. So we told the host who was ringing us up and I think the manager had her apologize but she only apologized for the extra dollar charged- not her shitty service. When we told the host how she treated us she gave us a friends and family discount- which we weren't looking for a discount but it was a nice gesture. Hopefully Kristie leaves the hospitality industry soon.",

The first chance I got, my brother-in-law and I both order the chicken and waffles. Let me tell ya...It's REALLY (No! It's REALLY Good.) The spice in the batter and the tender chicken breast (boneless) on top of melting butter and old fashion maple syrup and powdered sugar...It's heaven with every bite.  The chicken breast covered the entire waffle, so every bite you take has a piece of chicken and a piece of waffle. It's uber good stuff! And the portions were massive. I should have cut the portion in half and saved it for later. Because when I finished the entire plate, I was feeling the food coma effect. To top it off, our server Christine from Chicago was amazing. She was fun loving and had a great sense of humor. By the way, don't let their dress code (PJ) fool ya, they are very professional and serious about what they serve. I will definitely return here for another fix of Chicken and waffles and maybe try something else too. If you are in the area, you gotta stop by and try it.",

The biscuits and sausage gravy is excellent; finally, a place that serves country gravy properly! The hash browns are slightly spicy and super savory. There is a side of \"pot of bread\", which is a miniature cinnamon roll-like piece of amazingness served in a tiny mug with whipped butter on the side. Their pancakes are perfectly fluffy, and the syrup their place on the table has cinnamon barks floating inside. The steak eggs benedict is a feast for at least two people, and well worth the wait; the hollandaise sauce is creamy and rich, and the steak is tender and juicy. The atmosphere is also lovely. Flowery umbrellas are hung upside down, spinning above you as you dine. All is the servers are in pajamas, aiding to the comfortable, easy-going ambiance. You *need* to eat here!",

Which when we got to the front to pay the cashier said your check is wrong because  the jalapenos we're not on your check. And added $1.00.  So basically 2 breakfast with water to drink was $25.50.

    "text": "It had been over a year since our last foray to Southern Highlands to dine at Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issues that had kept us away for so long; the ineptitude of the hostess staff.  We added our name to the list when we arrived and were given a 30 minute wait time.  At the 45 minute mark, I asked about our table and was told that there were still 8 parties ahead of us and that they were seating the larger parties first.  uh, okay...  I asked if we could sit at the counter and was told that the counter was part of the wait list, but it was empty.  At the 1 hour mark, I inquired again and was told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  I asked again about the counter (now with one patron sitting there) and was told that it was closed today.  Weird    Even though I was annoyed, I felt committed to stick it out after waiting so long.  We were finally seated after waiting an hour and 20 minutes, but only because two parties of 2 in front of us gave up and left.  Maybe they did not appreciate being told that larger parties were more important than they were.   On to happier subjects:  The food!    I ordered the Ultimate steak & egg breakfast: $12.95 for an 8oz Rib Eye, two eggs, and hash browns with the pot of bread.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, the eggs and hash browns standard, and the pot of bread (basically a cinnamon roll) was good. solid 4/5    The BF had the Fried Chicken & Waffle: $11.95 for a boneless chicken breast coated in buttermilk and fried sitting on top of a Belgian waffle.   I didn't try this, but was told that it was just okay. 3/5    I also used the Chamucos Jalapeno Hot Sauce on my eggs and saw that it was made in Henderson.  The waitress noticed that I was reading the bottle and advised that they had bottles for sale for $6, so I scooped one of those up for home use!  I can't really say for sure if we'll ever go back, but I hope they work out their front of house issues.",

Their biscuits and gravy is addicting.  That along with some fresh squeezed orange juice (with lots of pulp) is a winner in my book.  My girlfriend is more adventurous when it comes to food, so she's tried more meals than I have.  She's liked everything she's ordered as well.  She loves the french press coffee.  I'm not a coffee guy so I figured I'd take her word for it.  Also, the staff is very friendly.  It's in a good area, not too far away from where I live, and the prices are great.  The prices for the meals are only slightly higher than what you'd pay at an IHOP or a Denny's, but the food is soooo much better.  You just really can't beat this place.  The only suggestion I have for this place is that they offer Gluten Free bread products.    A+++ in my book.",

The chilequiles were very flavorful and the chips were still a little crispy-which we loved! The french toast is huge and sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet-the perfect amount of cinnamon, crunch, and soft on the inside. Yum!  Can't wait to go back next Sunday!

The coffee is really good and the steak and chilaquiles is still my favorite dish. I've since tried the corned beef hash among other dishes and was quite impressed.   I think the potted bread as a side should be a little cheaper. I also think the wait staff is better than before but still needs a sense of urgency when moving around the restaurant. There's one brunette woman who I like a lot but some of the other servers seem less than alert. I'd like to see a bigger team effort when it comes to the service. There's nothing more frustrating when you see other servers standing around and my coffee cup is empty.",

The steak was well done instead of medium rare. I told the waitress and they fixed it immediately. The meal for me was nothing special. My friends on the other hand enjoyed their food very much. They ordered the chicken steak and Hash. I also ordered their Kale and apple drink it was really good! I just chopped it up that I picked the wrong thing on the menu.

Since we had plans to hike all day Sunday as well, we started with breakfast here.  We were not disappointed.  I got a country fried NY strip steak as big as my head and it was tasty.  I was even more impressed with my boyfriend's ribeye.  He ordered it medium well and it came out cooked beautifully to his liking and yet still as tender as the best medium and medium rare steaks I've had.  I am excited for my grandmother to come into town, as I am going to bring her her to try some of their vegetarian options (and selfishly so I can get that ribeye!)  They are a little pricey but I'd say worth it! (Side note for the restaurant owner should they see this -  I would love to rock one of your shirts because I tell everyone how good your food is and your shirt are cute, but $25 for a mass printed tee or tank feels much higher than necessary. I was ready to pay up to $15.)",

Food is really good quality, generous portion sizes, their little bread in a cup is quite a treat (a lightly sweetened cinnamon bun w/ a delicious side of frosting served in a tea cup) and service is exceptional by the servers, not so much w/ the hostesses.  Wait time on a Sunday 10:30-11:00am has been around 15-20mins   Downsides are their drinks are a little over priced, a cup of regular drip coffee is $3.25 so my husband & I usually just grab a Starbucks.  Another downer is their kid's menu doesn't include a kid's drink.  $3.15 for a glass of milk for my 5yr old is just highway robbery, lol.    Just a side note, their table w/ two single chairs & a bench, closer to the backend of the restaurant is one to avoid.  You can feel every little movement from the people sitting behind you when you're sitting on the bench side which gets to be rather annoying quite fast, totally need to fix that!",

However, when we were seated the service took a little while to get our food out and once our food did arrive, they delivered it to the wrong table, realized it a minute later and took it from that table and tried to deliver it to us which we refused. So we had to wait for everything to be made again. The staff was apologetic but did not offer any discount due to the issue.  Also the table that we sat at was half booth and half table and on the booth side it was very wobbly.  Whenever the people moved who were behind us it shook us which was quite annoying. We brought it to the staffs attention but they didn't do anything about it. They even sat another family behind us after the first one left when there was other seating available and after we informed them of the issue. You would think they wouldn't seat someone that would cause both parties issues. I feel like there was a lot of issues which they apologized for but they should've done one step closer by discounting our food.",

We were disappointed to find out that when my husband asked for additional gravy because the gravy that comes with Chicken Fried Steak does not cover it.

Not to mention their french press coffee and their super delicious hash browns. I have had the chicken and waffles, eggs benedict, and french toast for breakfast so far and have nothing but good things to say about all of it.  There is a unique and charming flare to this restaurant that we don't see much of in Vegas and it's that rare quality that keeps me going back. Thinking about it, there is really no breakfast joint here that I can even compare this place to and that says quite a lot to me. They may get a little busy at times, but Rise & Shine is certainly worth the wait.",

    "text": "Our family came here for the first time today and seriously can't see us going anywhere else in the valley for affordable and delicious breakfast/brunch/lunch. The food was flavorful, well-made, and the pot of bread will literally melt in your mouth. We ordered:  Rib Eye Steak and Chilaquiles: I have never had chilaquiles before and I seriously feel like i have been deprived my entire life. My steak was cooked perfectly the way I liked and the tortilla chips that were bathing in refried beans, scallions, and cotija cheese were the perfect accompaniment.   Chicken and Waffles: savory & sweet at its finest! The chicken was not dry at all, it was not overly battered and the waffles had a slight crunch on the outside but soooo soft and perfect on the inside. The maple syrup that they served with them was warm and had sticks of cinnamon in them! YUM.   Silver Dollar Pancakes with Strawberries: Our little guy devoured these. He especially loved the sprinkling of powdered sugar over top! I had a bite, and I must say, they are some of the best pancakes I have had. Perfectly light with a little bit of crispness around the edges.   Our food was absolutely perfect and if they only served these three things, we would STILL come back on a regular basis. Although the food was delicious, our absolute favorite part of this place was our server, RYLEY!!! She has such an amazingly genuine and kind energy about her. She complimented us on our parenting and how well behaved our four year old was. (she is a nanny herself, so knows a thing or two about kiddos) In a world where there is so much negative criticism, she is such a breath of fresh air! Our food came out in a timely manner and i LOVED that she brought out our little guy's food first, which in the parenting world is a God-send. Even our little guy liked her. He drew her little hearts on the comment card that we turned in! We left there feeling so lighthearted and truly lucky to have been helped by such an awesome person. We CANNOT wait to come back!!!",

As today is the their time in a year that I've ordered corned beef, I've noticed how very different it is now. There is hardly any corned beef I see in my plate . It's probably just this meal that they have changed but breakfast being the first meal of the day, this really made me lose my appetite. I didn't even touch the meal anymore . They showed me a side order of it and it's the same. I guess they don't understand, people expect breakfast from restaurants to be better than what we could make at home. This one is worst corned beef hash meal served to me in all the restaurants I've ever been to here and abroad.",

We were out and about last weekend and had a hankering for some waffles.  Straight-forward enough, but surprisingly hard to find.  This place pops up on Yelp so we give it a go.  Daaaang.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was on the ball, making sure our coffee was topped off and that we had anything we could possibly want.  The Lavazza coffee was ok, though not as mind-blowing as I would have thought from hearing people talk about it.  It's no Douwe Egberts, that's for sure.  My wife got the Nutella latte, which was ludicrously delicious.  The waffle and cinnamon french toast were fantastic.  Do not miss out on the pot of bread with a side of some outrageously addicting sugary dipping substance that should probably be outlawed.  I sure wish this place wasn't so far from where we are in Henderson.  It's a heck of a trek.  Also, be aware that this location does not feature all of the items pictured on the menu.  I would have loved to have tried the Oreo Butterscotch Pancakes, but that will require a trip to the other location.",

This restaurant had the most charm with their open kitchen and umbrella lights hanging from the ceiling. Riley was our server, who was so unbelievably kind and attentive to our half full coffees and waters. She was fast too!   We ordered up a two egg breakfast with bacon and potatoes ($9) and the corned beef hash and eggs ($10.50) PLUS a short stack of pancakes with warm cinnamon maple syrup. I know it sounds beyond basic, but this is the ultimate American breakfast at its best!  The corned beef was hearty, more on the beef side than the potato and the pancakes were light and fluffy. The bacon was just right, a crunch with a chewy middle.   This cute restaurant really seems to be a favorite around town and we will definitely stop by again after a weekend in sin city.",

During our numerous prior visits, we would always get the Country Fried Steak and Chicken & Waffles whenever we go. This most recent visit however, we noticed they changed the look of the menu and the price, it was $13 per entree (I believe it used to be around $10), it didn't come with sides anymore. I remember we would always get the side of biscuits to go with the Country Fried Steak and the famous Pot of Bread to go with the Chicken & Waffles. When I asked about it, she said said the portions are so large so you don't need the sides. If we want we could order them as extras.(what the??)  The food quality has gone downhill. We went around 2 pm on a Friday and there were only about 4 tables in there. And our food was over cooked and greasy.  Very unfortunate. This will not be our brunch place anymore!",

Their chicken and waffles is nowhere near Roscoe's quality, but it's a close second. Definitely the best in Vegas. Can't complain about the portion size either. The pot of bread is definitely not what I expected. I thought it'd just be a roll type of bread but I was wrong. To my surprise, it was more like a Cinnabon! And it looks small but it's still pretty filling.   The servers and hostesses were extremely friendly as well. Our server was sweet and gladly answered any questions I had about the menu. Not to mention, they're all dressed in pajamas which makes the place even better lol.  The reason why I have this place 4 out of 5 starts is because of the steak and eggs I ordered, which were also talked highly about on Yelp reviews. Personally I didn't see what the big deal was. I've had better tasting steak and eggs at Southpoint during their late night specials. The size of the steak was decent but the flavor was eh.   Other than that, I'd highly recommend this place for a staple breakfast spot.",

I ordered the Homemade Cornbeef & Hash with eggs with the Pot Bread, my other half ordered the Buffalo Chicken Breast with Eggs and Hash browns and a side of Pot Bread, and then we had a side of the Original Pancakes.   The corn beef hash was different from what most places offer, and was not heavy or bland. The dish was light and included a perfect amount and my eggs were cooked exactly as I had ordered.   My other half's plate, the Buffalo Chicken... Was excellent. The checkin breast was super moist, easy to cut (even with a fork), tender, juicy and definitely delicious. Side note, the buffalo sauce that's drenched on the chicken is a bit spicy but it does add a great kick to the chicken. The hash browns were great as well.   The pancakes, so soft and not mushy.   The pot bread was very light and not too sweet. Best dipped in the sauce that accompanies the dish.   I definitely recommend coming here if you want something a little different than your usual breakfast place.",

They have bar seating if your a party of 1 or 2 and dont want wait for a both or table. The waitress staff works really hard and fast to make sure your experience is a good one. Ask to be seated in vanessa's area. She is, fun, attentive and empathetic to your dining experience.  She gives you options along with your order that might not be on the menu or something you just didnt think of.  I ordered the ultimate steak breakfast.  It came with an 8 oz. Steak, 2 or 3 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of bread. One of the bread options is called a pot of bread.  The title is deceiving because it comes in a little cup. But if you like a warm ooey gooey cinnamon roll, then you'll love this. I like to judge a breakfast establishment also by their hash browns.  this place to me has great fresh hash browns.  The steak was medium and was tasty. Not too much pink and still pleasantly juicy. You will not be disappointed.  I ate every bite. -- jeryl, aka Randy",

The eggs were perfect, bacon was crispy, waffle was melt in your mouth and the hash browns were the best tasting I've had the pleasure to eat anywhere. My oldest son had the red velvet pancakes and the order was extremely generous. The cream cheese syrup that came with it was exquisite. The wife and my youngest son shared corned beef hash, eggs and bacon and the order was so big, the both of them could not finish it. My wife also had the french press coffee with her meal and that was incredible as well. The decor is original and the wait staff all wear pajamas as their uniforms which I thought was really cool.  Speaking of the wait staff, our server Riley was awesome, very attentive and made sure our beverages were never empty. The place was clean and you can tell the staff go the extra mile to make your meal very pleasurable. I can't wait to go back to this place when I get a chance.",

Went about six months ago and had the worst experience. There was only two other tables occupied and couldn't believe how slow the service was. ordered basic breakfast of eggs over bacon home fries and toast plus fresh orange juice. The eggs were overdone and the potatoes were so strange. Consistency and texture of glue! Yuck!!! The only thing good was the fresh squeezed juice. Was so damn dissapointed. Chalked it up to another crappy place in Southern Highlands. Wonder if something has changed in the last 6 months... Maybe I will try it one more time. Did I catch it on a VERY off day?? Hmm",

If your going to say your a \"steak & egg\" place your meat should be better quality especially when you are charging $13.25. The first 2 cups of coffee were warm. The pot of bread was okay-too much of a yeast taste for me. Service was okay, even though our waitress got our order mixed up with the table next to us-which might explain why the steak was not right. For 3 of us it cost over $40 for breakfast-definitely was not worth it. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "So this is my second visit.  Had the corned beef hash both times, first time service was ok, not the most attentive but adequate.  This time around the corned beef was not as good as the first time: this time it seemed like more potato than meat which is disappointing.  So may not come back for corned beef next time.  My party seemed to enjoy their food the most part, the chicken fried steak my sister in law had was very fatty and far too breaded.  Service this time was pretty bad, never checked how our food was, never bothered to see if we needed more beverages till we had to ask.  I asked for more water and only half the table got water...  So service is really lacking.  We were also very bothered that not just w our table but the table next to us when we were still eating or had food on our plate.  It was a clear ploy to get us going since they are backed up on a wait, but never rush your guests... Bad form.  Sure other people are giving 5 stars but I'm wondering they are being objective.  This place has some improvements to had if we are to come back.",

This place is 3 for 3.  Tried a three item omelette (avocado, cheddar and jalapeno) with the toast and hash browns.  Was delicious; huge portion could not finish.

Unfortunately our second experience included an array of issues that really weren't handled with the appropriate level of care from the staff. Our waitress, when taking our orders, did not write any of it down. There were 4 people in our party and we had a good amount of substitutions/additions to our orders. When she quickly repeated our order back to us before putting it in, she made atleast two mistakes. Not surprising, our food arrived and 3/4 people's orders were wrong in some type of way. They were corrected in a relatively timely fashion besides one friend who waited too long for her order to be corrected. Throughout the order corrections, the waitress did not express any sort of apologies to us. Good food, but a poor experience due to how the staff handled our orders.",

The steak & eggs dish was good and came with toast and hash browns. I shared this dish and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The steak had a nice char but wasn't as juicy as I'd hope. I loved the side of bacon we had. Can't go wrong with bacon!  Service was good but they forgot a couple of items and we had to remind them.",

Order the chicken and waffles (it's what they're known for). 4. The Red Velvet Chocolate Chip pancakes were the best I've had and their maple syrup is legit, and legit meaning it's not some cheapy syrup straight out of a plastic bottle. 5. Service is friendly and efficient here. They are very accommodating. 6. While you're enjoying your meal, look up at the ceiling and admire the fun umbrellas turned into flowers just spinning about.

    "text": "Sometimes after a weekend in Vegas, you just want to get out ASAP especially if you have a long drive home. We all have our exodus go to spots. Many of us want to cure our hang-overs so we head to Chinatown for Pho. Some want to get that steak and eggs for under $10 at smaller hotels. Few of us want to load up at a buffet before having to sit in that strenuous car ride and hoping that we can make it home before we have to drop the kiddies off at the pool. On the most previous occasion out to Sin City, I suggested something a little different to the crew. Let's check out this place called Rise & Shine, a Steak & Egg Place which is kind of south of the strip and sort of in the path back to LA. It seemed like the majority of the people who dined here were regulars and/or locals.   This little restaurant is open daily from 7am-3pm only. They serve breakfast items the entire time during their hours of operation and lunch menu kicks in at 11:30am. We arrived right before noon on Sunday. For our party of seven, it took nearly 20 minutes for them to get us a table. The place isn't really big to begin with. I would say that 4-5 people max per table is ideal. There is a dining counter and you can also eat outside if the weather permits. Take notice of the waitresses' uniform; they're catchy because they are wearing pajamas. An awesome concept and it looks very comfortable. The bus boys have black tee shirts on that say something along the lines of help them by visiting Yelp.  We all ended up ordering hefty breakfast dishes on this morning because we were all mc-fatties ready to go to town. I went with the Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast - cinnamon crunch coasted, served with a warm glass bottle of maple syrup ($8.95). I made it a platter by adding two eggs and a turkey kielbasa (bacon or sausage is also avail) for an extra $3.50. It was a big meal indeed. The French toast was soft but not mushy and full of flavors from the cinnamon and tang of the raisins. The big turkey kielbasa was a nice compliment with the eggs. Surely French toast by itself isn't sufficient. I was definitely a happy camper.  A couple of my friends got the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast & Waffle ($11.95) which was a hit on the table. A thick piece of battered chicken breast sitting on top a fluffy waffle. Juicy white meat and far from dry. It's nothing like Roscoe's Carol C. Special but it should deserve recognition of its own. Before you start bashing me by saying, \"I've had better fried chicken Smitcha!\" All I'm saying is that it's pretty good and never did I claim it was the best I've had.   Another friend ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak but from what I heard, he wasn't too impressed and felt like he should've went with the fried chicken and waffles.  Service was on point and like an oldskool coffee shop, I took my tab and paid at the register. I regret not trying pot of bread that everyone seems to be rave about on Yelp. Bring your appetite to this place because after this meal, I was seriously full until later that night. Plus, there are many options to choose from their menu. I will say that it was a great meal but it also made me feel like I was good on a typical American breakfast for some time. Once in a while a 1500+ calorie, single serving meal is okay but just not too often or else Dr. Chen will start chewing me out about my weight and high blood pressure.",

It sounds strange and we almost didn't try it but it was delicious! It is half cinnamon roll, half bread roll, all baked and served in a petite mug with cream cheese frosting.

    "text": "I live right off of Valle Verde, so on my morning drive to get Starbucks, I noticed that this place had opened up. I decided to take the time out to stop in since I'm always on the lookout for good places close by.   As I walked in I immediately noticed the decor, which is very bright and colorful, with pretty patterned umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, which I found to be a nice atmosphere to start my day in.  The two women at the front counter greeted me warmly and sat me immediately, and told me my server would be Maria.   Maria asked if I'd been there before, then explained the menu to me when I said I had not. I decided to go with a ham steak breakfast with a pot of French press and some OJ.  Maria brought me my cup of bread, which comes with the breakfast and is apparently a specialty of theirs. I was a bit skeptical as to whether it would be any good, but it was basically like an extremely fluffy cinnamon roll inside of a cup, with the sauce/icing on the side, and I enjoyed it a lot.   When the ham steak came out I was also surprised, as I was expecting a normal sized, 6-8 inch around, half an inch thick steak. The steak they brought out was at least an inch thick, and probably a foot or so around, a good pound or more of meat. I wasn't sure if I'd even be able to finish it, but it was so juicy, tender, and smoky that I managed to eventually, although I sat there for a good hour or so.   The eggs and hashbrowns were a bit above average, tasty with a kick of seasoning that isn't usually included, and added some extra interest to the dish.   The French press is touted as Lavazza, which I've had before at other restaurants. Although as a coffee snob I'll say it isn't the best cup of coffee I've ever had, it is better than the coffee at 90% of other restaurants in Las Vegas, and having a good cup of French press to go with the steak made it much easier to digest.   The OJ tasted fresh squeezed and had a slice of orange as a garnish, which I was happy about as concentrate at restaurants bothers me.   The entire time I was there Maria was very attentive to me, always making sure my water was full, if I needed anything else, asking if I liked everything, and joking about being proud of me being able to finish the ham steak.   As I left I asked for the manager, Gilberto, who I met just so I could tell him that Maria and the front and back end staff were all great. He was very polite to me, asked me what I had, introduced himself, and made me feel like a valued customer.  All in all this seems like it will be my new favorite local breakfast place, and I'm glad they opened up right across the street. The one qualm I have is they need beds in the back, because after you finish one of their steaks you really feel like rolling back into bed and not getting out till after 12 or 1.",

    "text": "NOTE: This is a long review but they deserve all the attention. BELIEVE ME. If you are in Vegas, it is worth the drive off the strip to eat here. You will probably be stuck in line at those buffets anyways so use that time to drive here.   First of all I want to thank, April, our waitress. She was great! Also, I wanted to thank Yelp for helping me find this place. It is a hidden Gem outside the Vegas Strip. This place IS the BEST breakfast place in Vegas.   Customer Service: 5 stars - everyone is super friendly with big smiles. The manager does come around and sees how everyone is doing.  Atmosphere/decor: cute and very clean. Also in the back of everyone's T-shirts except the waitresses, its say, \"help us by Yelping us\" or something like that. I thought that was really cute and they found out I was a Yelp Elite. LOL  Food: 1000 STARS!!   I really love this place. We called ahead to see if they take reservations but they don't. But I understood when I got there. Luckily when we went on Sunday morning, it wasn't packed and we got seated right away. The prices is decent for what you get. It was $50 for a group of 4. If you went to IHOP you would have paid MORE and got crappy food. I saw some reviews saying how it is a bit expensive, when you think about it, Denny's and IHOP is about the same if not more. For steak at those places it would be MINIMUM $20 per place. Here - LESS then $15! that is a STEAL!   Okay, since I got all that out of my way, here is what we ordered:  -Chicken and Waffles with Pot of Bread - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A?select=4aw7W0owSbC7V9Zxa8T96w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/C9Im...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/C9ImzBi5fn742ZcAYDww2A?select=AR6qplqPO_OJC4aye5xbTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/C9Im...</a> The Pot of Bread was AMAZING! MUST ORDER!! Honestly, it was the best bread I ever had. It came out piping hot and just perfect. It wasn't too sweet but wasn't plain. The bread was very fresh and soft.  The chicken and Waffles was very yummy! The portion was REALLY big and enough to share. I was very impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and was perfectly crispy. It had a small kick of spice in it and it was perfect. The Waffles was nice and fluffy. I am not a Waffle fan but I LOVED IT! honestly fell in love with this place.  -The ULTIMATE Steak and Egg Breakfast: the steak came out perfectly well seasoned and very tender. I loved it. It was just delicious. The Hash browns potatoes that came with it was a bit soggy. We thought it would come out more crispy then soft. -New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel - I didn't order it but I had a piece. It was delicious also! The Spinach went really well with the steak.   Thank you Rise and Shine for the great experience. I will be back every time I go to Vegas. I just wished you opened up another one over here in Southern California. That would be a GREAT investment.",

    "text": "On this visit I came alone and a bit later than I would have liked. There is no denying that the food is great... but I am back to concerned about the service. My waitress who I have had several times was awesome. But the bar was empty,  several empty tables and I was told a 10 to 15 minute wait. It took the hostess a very long time to seat the empty tables and my wait was closer to 25 mins... bar was still empty when she took me there. I was served quickly. However the plate looked like a train wreck. No grapes as I have come to expect here, they obviously haven't scrubbed the grill between orders as there was much grainy char on the plate. The servers seem to use the bar area to drop stuff on (menus, unwanted table items etc) and the buckets that have silverware and napkins at the back of the bar had a layer of dust on the back edge. Seems like a loss of revenue to not have the bar full of payomg customers instead of empty and full of mislaid items. My suggestion... either a) assign a waitress to the bar that can handle it and a table or two or b) maybe get a bus boy or hostess who is maybe interested in becoming a server to take just the bar. You lost 4 tables of 2 to 3 people while I waited and probably more as I ate. Again food is really tasty but the inconsistencies will lose customers.  Cary runs her butt off to make sure customers are taken care of.",

    "text": "My new favorite breakfast spot.  No joke, it literally blows all others that even attempt to serve breakfast out of the water.  The best part is, I don't have to wait forever to get a table like those dumb suckers that wait for an hour at Babycakes for crappy food.  Every time I have been there, on a weekend, I have always gotten a table very quickly.  The reason why I love this spot is that they have totally focused only on breakfast, and with a carefully crafted menu, in executing it flawlessly.  You can tell with every dish, that much thought went into how to prepare it.  And the waitresses in pajamas, how awesome is that?     I really appreciate the love that went into this place, so much that I want to give the owner a hug.  The first time we went, my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  While this is not kobe beef steak, it is cooked extraordinarily well, especially for a breakfast joint.  The steak is juicy and flavorful and contrasts perfectly with the eggs.  He has also ordered the chicken fried steak and while that was extremely heavy, he loved it and said it was the best he's had since he was a kid in Montana, where apparently that type of dish is extremely common.  I have tried the chicken and waffles and a veggie omelet.  The chicken, just like the steak, was cooked perfectly.  And even more impressive than the steak, they managed to keep the chicken completely juicy, warm, and flavorful.  But the waffles were even better.  They were completely soft and almost pancake-like, and extremely fluffy.  I normally don't like waffles because they tend to be so heavy, but they managed to capture the flavor of waffles in a way that did not make me want to sleep for the next 10 days.  They also were topped with a cinnamon maple syrup which was totally memorable.  So if you are looking for the best breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further than Rise & Shine.  They may not be open the entire day, and their menu may be limited in scope, but what they do they do extremely well, and every time I go I am even more impressed with their consistent quality of food and service.",

    "text": "Sometimes I think I shouldn't write reviews about the places I like because I'd rather keep it a secret.  But in these hard times I'd like the places I love to stay busy enough to survive.  Finally a breakfast spot for Southern highlanders.  I'm tired of having to drive miles just for a decent breakfast.  I can't say that I am blown away by the decor or the service.  Heck, there was even a 30 minute wait to get in.  If I were rating on that alone I'd give out an average score of three stars.  The saving grace of this place live behind the counter.  Those cooks are doing a great job and I hope they get paid well.  My girlfriends french toast was the best she's had in Vegas so far.  It didn't even need any syrup on it.  It was just delicious.    My steak looked like your average steak, but let me tell you, it is hard to find a place that can cook a steak just right.  Normally, you go into a busy restaurant and the steak comes out either over cooked or damn near raw; however, this place was jam packed with people and my steak came out cooked just how I ordered it.  It was even seasoned well.  No A1 required.  I haven't had a steak this good at a restaurant in years!  So go check this place out.  It has all the normal favorites made better then most places you'll eat at.",

They make them wear pajamas which I thought was a little weird... I ordered a country fried steak and egg breakfast. This thing was enormous and I was excited, but when I cut into it I realized that it was WAY over breaded and didn't really taste like much. It didn't come with gravy which is my fault for not asking but that would have helped. The hash browns were pretty good and the egg was fine. They brought me this thing called a \"pot of bread\" it was just a roll in a coffee mug. I would have rather had some toast or a pancake or something besides a plain roll. I give it a 3 because of how hard I see the wait staff working but the kids working in the back may need some more experience on preparing the food. I probably won't come back.",

    "text": "I LOVE breakfast! And Rise & Shine far exceeded my expectations that fellow yelpers have laid out for me. Thank you once again Yelp for showing me a True gem in this hot, chain ridden unforgiving desert. Now on to the details...  At first glance Rise & Shine looks to be a very small nook of a restaurant at the corner of a nice new strip mall in Southern Highlands. And that's pretty much what it is. But don't let looks deceive you! This small nook has so much to offer.   We were greeted by a tall gentleman in a blue striped shirt who sat us promptly at a booth facing the open kitchen. It almost seemed as if he was welcoming us into his home, so I assumed it was his establishment in some form or another.   Our server followed to take our drink order, and say hi to the little mama, and we decided on the French Press Illy coffee (do not pass this up!) and some waters. She returned very quickly with our own personal French press, two mugs, a sand timer with three strengths, and some real cream (hallelujah). She explained the timer, took our order of Steak Chilaquiles, a Spinach Swiss Avocado Omelet, and two pots of bread, and whisked away in her cute paisley pjs.   The coffee was divine after letting steep until just after the yellow timer ran out, then pressing with much anticipation... fresh, aromatic, strong!, and ours to pour as we wished.   The pots of bread came out first as little mama was hungy, and was getting antsy, and the three of us shared in a blissful pulling and devouring of the light fluffy just barely there cinnamon bread with fresh jam and real butter. I could have eaten five of those pots by myself!  Then came our meals. I wish I could have taken pictures, but they lasted a whole millisecond after our server set them down before we dove in like hungry hyenas. The smell of fresh ingredients was overwhelming, and we were all foaming at the mouth!  Hubby's Steak Chilaquiles were unreal. Fresh tortilla chips smothered in refried beans and a slightly spicy sauce, with cheddar and cotija cheeses, then topped with two over medium eggs and avocado, and a whole dinner sized rib eye steak that was PERFECTLY seasoned, with a side of salsa and sour cream. Heaven!   My omelet, while simple and unassuming, was perfection. Not too overly huge as some omelets in this town can be, not too overloaded with cheese, or grease from cheap cheese (uck!), but beautifully fluffy and balanced, topped with creamy green avocado. Fabulous! The potatoes were fantastic, and again perfectly seasoned, and didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce (as I usually drench restaurant taters in).   Each plate was accompanied by a fresh fruit stack of strawberries pineapple and oranges, which little mama enjoyed so much, the tall man in the blue striped shirt came by and offered her more of, which she gleefully took and crammed more in her sweet face.   All in all, this place was so pleasing, it is now our favorite breakfast joint in town hands down. We will be returning (more than likely next weekend!), often! Hurray YELP!",

    "text": "Surprised the hubby to a Vegas trip for his birthday and of course he wanted to find a steak and egg spot. Naturally we would've gone somewhere on the strip but being the yelpers we are we found this spot and content with the results. I'm such a foodie but since I'm also trying to watch my portions I was hesitant on what I would order. I ended up ordering the steak omelette (egg whites only) which came with the sauce and hash browns. Went with the bread in pot as my side bread option which was PERFECT for me since I'm watching my food portions. I enjoyed every bite of the perfectly cooked steak and the omelette was fluffy. I will say that they put a little too much cheese in it but overall great flavor. I was full and didn't even touch the hash browns but my hubby said they were yummy. He ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin which he said was just perfect. This will be a must breakfast spot next time were in Vegas.",

Lots of 80's music during your visit to clear your head. Condiments on the table include a variety of Cholula sauces instead of just Tobasco. A new thing for us is the \"cup of bread\". Savory and sweet pop over in a teacup with powdered sugar and a glaze of cream cheese and sugar. So cute and tasty, we ordered an extra one! Coffee is Lavazza. Very good! There is a small 55+ menu and the steak and one egg is a winner. The steak is well-seasoned. I had the two egg breakfast with bangers. Super tasty! Portions are appropriate, not too much for one meal. This place is perfect for a nice, reasonably priced meal on your way out of Vegas and back to reality. This place deserves to be in your rotation!",

    "text": "This place was on my bookmark for a while so my sister and I wanted to try it. It was nearby and we were hungry for some good brunch so we decided to try this place! When we first came in we were waiting for quite a bit of time. The lady at the front did not bother to acknowledge us or maybe she did not see us. It took a while to get seated down, but it was packed so no biggie. We looked at the menu for a while and we found out what we wanted to get after a few minutes.   We waited for a long time for a server to come by after seating us down, but no one bothered to ask us for anything? A kind lady came by and apologize for the wait so we were cool and just ordered what we wanted. Got the food at a normal pace despite the fact that it is busy. Food was so good as we got the Philly-Style Cheese Steak & Eggs and Smoked Salmon-N-Eggs Benedict. Perfectly seasoned and so delicious! The Cup-o-bread is delicious and so unique.   However, service here is... not so good. From looking at other tables, they were taken care of quickly and treated well unlike how we were treated. We were sat down with no one coming by until 10-15 minutes later. No one came to check on us and we had to wave down a different server to get utensils after our food arrived. It felt like we were cast aside and no one wanted to bother our table. My sister's water cup was empty and we had to get a server to help refill it, but she never came back so I gave my water cup to my sister. It made my sister and I feel out of place and it left a bad taste after we left the place.   Was planning to come back here, but after how we were treated and cast aside, probably not going back if it makes us feel bad.   Food: 4.8/5 Service: 2/5",

As for the food, after trying it on that fateful Easter Sunday, we promptly returned the following week. I cannot praise their signature Cup-O-Bread, Chilaquiles, and orange juice enough.  The Cup-O-Bread is a warm, gooey, sweet cinnamon roll. It's perfection served up in a cute lil' cup.  The Chilaquiles is basically a plate of hearty breakfast nachos and a great vegetarian option. The serving size is so huge, it makes me cry that I can never finish it in one go since I know they won't warm up well. It feels criminal to let something so good go to waste.  Lastly, the orange juice is delicious. Even at the steep price of $4.50 per glass, I highly recommend it (and I'm not even a big fan of juice)!   Overall, great breakfast option. The staff knows how to hustle plus breakfast is gloriously indulgent, unique, and delicious.",

We then asked her you are charging us extra for just scrambling the eggs when she stated it was going to be mix with the tortillas and she replied there is no tortillas on this dish we then pointed to the tortillas and she said oh the CHIPS  I wonder as to  how she thinks chips are made. We kept explaining that she has said the extra charge ment scrambled eggs with the tortillas not placed on top she kept saying how can I fix this I don't understand over and over after we had thoroughly explained various times. Overall the food was decent not something I would crave or revisit. Oh one last note there was a state mandated health warning you know the one that says drinking alcoholic beverages can cause birth defects and cancer in the restroom because that's where everyone will see it lol.",

Shrugged it off thinking maybe she had hard day. Coffee wasn't fresh tasted a bit sour. That's fine not here for the coffee.         Ordered omelette with hashbrowns and toast on the side. Omelette was ok, burned toast and burned hashbrowns. They messed up my wife's biscuit by pouring on gravy over it, which she didn't order. The waitress pointed it out and asked if she would like another but we waited for so long we didn't bother.         Just little things that shouldn't be blown out of proportion but I can honestly do better food at home. Its too bad, I was hoping this would a nice place to go every weekend.

I couldn't decide what I wanted & 'everything' wasn't an option, so I let him choose our meals! Haha. We usually end up sharing, anyway   We got the steak and eggs with hash browns and the breakfast burrito, which was sooooo huge & came with rice, beans, avocado, salsa, & both green and red sauce.   Everything was absolutely amazing! I want to emphasize again that the burrito was massive. Definitely enough to share. It was also very delicious. The steak was cooked as we asked (medium rare) & it was seasoned very nicely too. As a side, we got the cup-o-bread (I think that's what it's called) & it was warm & fresh. That cream cheese dipping sauce was so yum, I wanted more!   Food was amazing, service friendly & prompt (love that they're in their pj's too!). Would recommend to friends & visit again when we come back from Hawaii!",

The waiters wear pajamas, which I thought was a very unique touch. It felt homey and I can't wait to go again when I'm in town! The only downside is that I felt it was expensive. I didn't pay attention and let my 5 yr old order OJ. Well it's fresh squeezed so it ended up costing more than my coffee! The bill was over $60 for a family of 5 and that's after two kids shared a plate and my oldest daughter and I shared a plate. Just come prepared to drop a nice dollar. The kids waffle was delicious but not fluffy enough and very small portion. It was hard and crispy.",

Inside this simple exterior tucked in a strip mall you'll find some excellent food.  The inside is similarly simple but with a warm, comfortable feel.  There is a small outside patio area with tables they will setup for you with an umbrella to shield you from the desert sun.  This is ideal if you want to dine with your four legged friend.  The servers wear pajamas!  It's True!  What a fun little touch.  They seemed very friendly as well, and drinks were kept topped up.  The food was awesome.  I recommend their ultimate steak and eggs featuring two or three eggs, hash browns, steak, and a bread choice.  I went for scrambled eggs.  These were just OK; the consistency was kind of... solid.  Sort of like when you scoop them out of a hot tray at a buffet.  The hash browns were very good.  Crispy, crunchy, and actually seasoned instead of just salty.  The steak... wow!  I did not expect it to be such good quality.  It was marbled but not overly fatty, and it was tender and tasty.  I ate the whole thing, and I'm not even a huge steak fan!  Do yourself a favor and try the pot of bread choice.  Think of a small cinnamon roll served in a teacup and you'll get the idea.  It's just enough for a bit of sweetness without eating a huge cinnamon roll.  Given the quality and quantity of food it's a bargain at $14.95 ($16.95 with three eggs).  Rise and Shine was awesome!  Give it a try!",

That being said, after eating here, yeah, I'd totally recommend it and go back!   Here's what I ordered: - Grilled Chicken - Tomato - Lettuce - Fried Egg - Double Avocado - Grilled Onions   This combo was BOMB and the chicken was seasoned so dang perfectly I would have loved to have a few more breasts!!   While a few components of my meal were missing when first delivered, our server rushed back to get them- and added extra to the mix! Breakfast/lunch turned out to be delicious and the perfect portion size for my hunger levels!",

    "text": "Just so so, overall. It's a cute little place with hanging flowers made from umbrellas, which gives you a comfy, garden type of vibe. Ordered a build your own omelet but I didn't realize I literally had to build it lol! My point being that I ordered one with American cheese, cheddar cheese and salsa. It came out with the cheese in it but the salsa was off to the side in a little bowl which I actually at first just thought it was extra or something. When I cut into it, it was clear that the salsa was for me to open up the omelette and put the salsa in myself which seems to completely defeat the purpose of an omelette.... in my opinion. Who orders an omelette to open it up and butcher it? Then we had to wait for two orders of toast to come out and the waitress seemed annoyed at the fact that we had even let her know we didn't get it. I can't say I enjoyed it much overall as far as experience goes.   FOOD: Build your own omelette is a not what it's all \"cracked up to be\"  :) The food is tasty but I think I was a bit salty that I had to build my own omelette.   AMBIANCE: Very comfortable and welcoming interior. The staff get to wear their pajamas to work which makes it an even more comfortable and relaxing feel.   SERVICE: Sub-par at best. I didn't like that our waitress seemed annoyed that we were asking for the rest of our order that we were entitled to and paid for..... how is the customer to blame for that?She have off the vibe of a nice/nasty attitude, that needs to be adjusted. I would give this place a second chance though.   DRESS CODE: Very casual (The staff gets to wear pajamas to work, need I say more?)",

I just never expected the amount to be that high for something we order all over the West coast for usually $9-11. My wife had Corn Beef Hash. Very small amount that was decent tasting but nothing to let your mom know about. My Chicken Fried Steak was tender but very greasy. The gravy was your basic gravy. My hash browns tasted like they were old and had been sitting on the grill too long.  Now what REALLY pissed me off was when I was placing my order I asked for Rye toast and was told that I had to pay extra for that. WHAT? My dam order costs $16 and I have to pay extra for toast. What a load of crap. Of course my for some lame reason my wife whose order came with toast.  I will never set foot in this place again.",

My complaint was that I ordered corned beef hash and it had more potatoes ( 95% )than I have ever seen in hash and you needed a magnifying glass and tweezers to find the corned beef. When I asked the waitress she apologized and said it is portioned out and pre made. My advice is if you are going to serve corned beef hash make sure there is corned beef in it after all it is called CORNED BEEF hash not Potatoes with a sprinkling of corned beef, I had ordered it as I have to eat low carb high protein. I ended up with bangers and bacon and high was good but not what I really wanted. I am willing to try this again I just hope they fix the corned beef issue",

I regret not snapping a photo of the spread. Everything came out hot and fresh at the same time. Oh, also make sure to get the fresh squeezed orange juice, you won't regret it.

I drove here from Henderson, its located on Southern Highlands Pkwy & Cactus. If it was close, I'd be the Duchess...fast! And weigh much more, probably...  I was a waitress back in the day at locally owned restaurants like Rise & Shine, and as I giggle watching these ladies serve food dressed in flannel pajamas, all I wondered was \"Why didn't I work at a place where pjs were the uniform?!?!\" How much more comfortable can you make it, right?! So you can imagine, it definitely has a warm feeling. The smell of French toast and coffee and cinnamon gets your nose up as you walk in the door.   The menu - you can order your standards. Omelets, pancakes, bacon & eggs. Then you see Crunch Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and Spiced Rubbed Rib Eye Chilaquiles, Fried Chicken and Waffles, and homemade Corned Beef Hash.   What else? Most egg plates come with your choice of toast, biscuit, or the ever popular pot of bread. Very adorable little round loaf of slightly cinnamon gooey deliciousness seem to be on many tables during my visits.   The drinks - freshly squeezed orange juice is always a favorite of mine I share with my son. But I had to try their French press coffee after reading about it. A generous serving is brought to your table, accompanied by a sand hourglass, with three separate colored sands. You decide which sand to follow to determine how strong you want your coffee. Love it!! (see photo if you can't picture what I'm saying)  I haven't dined here for lunch, but I slightly glanced at it while drooling over the breakfast choices. If you're not in the mood for breakfast, like their current special, Baked Blueberry Pecan French Toast Casserole or my personal favorite, Make-Your-Own Yogurt Parfait, you can choose from burgers, salads, panini sandwiches, and daily specials like meatloaf, fish & chips, and chicken broccoli pot pie, served until they run out. They also offer a few kid's plates, however, if you have a toddler like me, the generous portions they serve is more than enough to share! Prices are decent, the service I've received have been warm, inviting, and prompt.   I think if the next few visits are as awesome as my previous ones, they definitely warrant a 5-star review. For now, it is far to drive to, and I do wish they offered lighter healthier options, too. Do I end up ordering them? Not much. But I like having the choice when I'm feeling weight-conscious on those rare occasions. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Rise & Shine's yummy breakfasts!",

    "text": "I like to give some credit where credit is due. But, there's not one thing that impressed me or even remotely satisfied me about this place.   To say that I'll never come back is an understatement. I want the 2.5 hours of my life back with it. We arrived at 950 and were given a 15 minutes wait time, we were sat at 1041. That's right,  almost 50 minutes later. The only reason we waited was because of the great reviews. I'm willing to give some time for something delicious without a problem. Again, it was a Sunday, so a wait is expected, but I counted 3 groups before us who I overheard complain of the wait. ..one waited close to an hour! If my meal had been mildly satisfying I wouldn't be giving 1 star.  By the time we were sat, we were crazy hungry. So, you would think that because we were starving ANYTHING would taste like heaven!  There were 5 of us, and 2 ordered two meal options to share, so we ordered 7 different things. I don't even remember how long the food took, but it definitely wasn't a reasonable amount. I'll start by saying 2 ordered ribeye option and we left half of it on our plate.  I've never had such disappointing ribeye in my life. And my father who never complains, commented on the quality. I don't remember what came on the side with it because everything on that plate was a total dissapointment. The burrito my boyfriend ordered was pretty to look at, but even with the handful of ingredients was nothing but a bland mess. We get a \"dessert\" pancake that we had one bite of and didn't take home, which we always do because I hate wasting food but there was no saving that thing to eat later.   Considering you pay about $11-16 per dish, I would think you get something well worth your money. I'm thinking now, their hope is to starve people with the wait in hopes they're so hungry at the end they just inhale everything and say it tasted delicious.   Either way, don't take my word, eat here then drive down a bit further and try something else. There's a plethora of restaurants within a couple miles, some good, this one terrible. Also, please stop with the pajama uniform. It's not cute. I couldn't tell which waitress was awake and which rolled right out of bed. Some of those pajamas looked pretty gross. The staff looked more disheveled than the customers.",

    "text": "Yelp- you once again helped me find my new favorite breakfast place (in Las Vegas anyway)!  I found this place using my mobile search app, and I must say I am damn glad I did.  First of all, the atmosphere is darling- bright sunny yellow walls, cute parasol light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it just made you feel more cheerful walking through the door.   The servers were all on point, and maybe that is because they are extra comfy- all of the servers are working in their PJ's.    Now for the important part- the food.    I ordered the chilaquiles and eggs. They didn't dissapoint.  Eggs cooked perfectly atop perfectly cooked tortilla chips softened in a tangy but not too spicy tomato sauce.   My Son put the hurt on a huge portion of chicken and waffles.  He was also impressed that they did little things like warming the syrup.   My daughter ordered a spinach/mushroom/swiss omelette.  She said it was delicious and not \"too\" cheesy.  My husband ordered the english banger sausage and eggs.  He said that the sausage was a bit too mild, and could have been a little more savory.   If there was anything that I could say could improve is explaining to the customers the unique things that the restaurant offers-  The server asked us if we wanted toast, muffin or what sounded like \"powder bread\" .  None of us knew what the hell that was, so nobody ordered it.   It was only later that I noticed these cute little individual breads baked in tiny little terra cotta pots sitting in the pass.   I would have definitely ordered this just to give something new a try.  Something that could have been avoided with a little enunciation.",

The one reason I wanted to try the restaurant was for that bread. Disappointed, we ordered peanut butter and blueberry French toast and a steak Benedict. The food came out quickly and the steak was prepared pretty close to perfect. The food was amazing the coffee was quite delicious and the service was excellent. As we sat around chit chatting after our meal, the waitress brought out a fresh and hot pot of bread! She surprised us all and created a WOW moment! The bread was delicious and perfect even though we were stuffed, we made sure to eat it all up! I would definitely return and recommend this little gem of a breakfast place! There is no doubt why they were voted a best of the best!",

But it was pretty full at that hour so I would imagine weekends would have a wait.  There was very little space to sit and wait inside, so I'm glad we didn't get stuck waiting out in the heat :)  First of all, you HAVE to get the pot of bread as your accompanying starch.  Holy crap, it is freaking awesome!  It's a biscuit and a cinnamon roll smashed together and then baked in a coffee cup.  Slather it with some butter and you're in heaven.  I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was a gamble since I'm from Texas and have a pretty high bar.  It was SO good!  Really tender with a delicious coating!  Only complaint is that the coating didn't adhere very well to the steak but that's really just a quibble :)  It came with eggs and cream pepper gravy, yum yum!  I also got one of their smoothies which took forever to come out, but it was really delicious.  My husband order the rib eye chilaquiles and it was just as good as some of the ones we've gotten in Mexico.  We were super impressed!  The decor was a bit hokey but cute.  They have flower umbrellas inverted and hanging from the ceiling.  It helped transform the location from a strip mall to something more inviting.    Finally, the service was super attentive and prompt.    Overall, we loved it and highly recommend it!  We definitely will be hitting this up next time we're in Vegas!",

But heck, all the staff seems great.   The decor is incredibly imaginative. The ceiling fans all have umbrella-like covers that are large flower prints - dahlias, chrysanthemums, others. The wall colors are vibrant. Located in a strip mall, the restaurant is modest size. It's also quite popular, so don't be surprised to wait for a table.  However long your wait, it's worth it. The food is sublime. Rise and Shine bills itself as a steak-and-eggs place, so I ordered steak and eggs. My half pound ribeye was perfectly done and just great flavor. I asked Lisa the secret. She said the steaks are seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and coffee grounds. She said the delicious hash browns had the same seasonings except substitute shallots for coffee grounds.   Your order comes with a choice of breads: get the \"pot of bread,\" as unique an offering as there is. It's a cinnamon roll baked in a coffee cup. Tip the cup and out comes the roll; apply butter and enjoy!  Chicken and waffles is also on the menu; the waffle is light and terrific with the cinnamon-infused syrup. The chicken breast is pounded thin, breaded and flash fried to a crispy delight, moist and tender and not greasy at all.   How about the coffee: choose from an Italian blend, or French press. The French press comes with a three-tube hourglass that allows you to gauge the strength of your coffee.   An important part of the dining experience is your server. He or she can make or break your meal. The servers here are clad in pajamas which are colorful and clearly comfortable. Lisa was an integral part of our experience. She engaged with us, laughed, joked, teased and was teased in return. She took excellent care of us.   In a city full of great restaurants and celebrity chefs, this small family owned and operated restaurant is a gem.",

This last time we got in right after they opened and had zero wait getting seated. But then we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our food (a long time with a hungry 2 year old) our server didn't even make eye contact when she was talking or supposed to be listening, we had to consistently ask for refills, toast that was supposed to come with breakfast, creamer etc. and the bathroom was in a pretty dismal state. Also no biggie but would be nice if they would add non fat milk to the menu.   Lastly, we went on Mother's Day and they handed out roses to every mother but me! I didn't want to ask, \"hey, can I have a flower too??\" I had the damn baby and I want my rose! ;) I'm pretty sure our waitress just wasn't paying any attention but I felt like the black sheep, ha.  I might give it a third go to see if it's the charm but honestly, I left feeling like I'd have had a better experience at an IHOP and would have spent less.",

However, my trip to Rise & Shine a steak and egg place provided me with one of the best corned beef hash entrees I've ever had. The pulled corned beef had a great sear on it with a nice malliard browning along with some caramelized onions, red skin potatoes, and two eggs over easy and I was in corned beef nirvana.  The owners really spent some time perfecting this simple yet amazing dish.  The place is quaint with a creative decor and spinning umbrellas line the ceiling, a friendly homey staff and lavazza coffee, fresh pressed orange juice made fresh daily make it a breakfast spot not to miss!  Rumor is they are opening up another one in summerlin.  Can't wait to try it!",

Fresh watermelon& strawberry, orange, or green juice. Our waitress was really friendly as well. If you're in Vegas this is a MUST try. I look forward to coming back & im so excited I found my go to breakfast place in Vegas. You cannot beat the quality of this food.",

The pot of bread was great as others have commented, but, the best offering, WARMED SYRUP. Such a sumple concept that so many get wrong.   Daughter had chcken and waffles, yum, tasted kinda like pancake batter on the chicken. Baby girl ordered chicken fried steak which did not disappoint.  The gravy is served in ramekins on the side. Hb had corn beef hash which was disappointing. Had a lemony taste to it. Unpleasant.  I had the crunchy french toast, wow! Never thought I'd enjoy it, but, it was great as well.   Overall, can only go four stars due to the lemony corn beef. Riley was a great server, best service we've had sine we've been in Vegas.",

I love the presentation, wait staff, hostesses, and their little clay pot of cinnamon bread is mouth watering! The last time I posted, the new girl Shannon has now settled right in, and we love her!   I would like to post a photo of one of my breakfast platters on here, but not sure how. The portions are generous, food is fresh, and their coffee is the bomb!!    When I see someone who writes a negative review for something so little like they had to \"wait\" oh my, have you ever been to Hash House A Go-Go? I mean come on folks, that's the reason why people wait because it's that freakin good! What what the heck do people expect? Restaurants have bad days once in a while too, sometimes things don't go perfect everyday, and NO, the breakfast doesn't come on a silver platter for all you snobs out there! This is the real deal, real food, real people, and it's a 10 Spot!! Just sayin... : )",

I especially like the omelets, and banger sausage. Lots of my friends like the pot of bread, but I'm not a big fan. I'd rather they go all the way and make it a cinnamon roll.   Coffee is excellent, they have French press along with drip. I prefer the press, but typical come with my 3 year old so I don't like the large pot of hot liquid.   Rise and Shine also has out door seating. It's on the west side of the building so early it gets shade. Nice in the summer. Also good for the morning health nuts who finish bicycle rides or runs here.",

Well this is hard for me because I am from Texas and have grown accustomed to good chicken fried steak.  The one served here looks like a chicken fried steak. The cream gravy is good but every time I've had it here they didn't trim the fat.  Nothing worse than cutting a piece off and the first bite bieng oddly chewie.

I've never had a better breakfast in my life. The breading on the chicken was light, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. The chicken was tender and juicy and a great contrast to the warm and fluffy waffle. The maple syrup was just buttery enough to tie it all together. I already want to go back for more.

However, when you see all the servers handling dirty dishes and then grab the toast out of the toaster with their bare hands, that just won't work for me.  I quit going there about 2 years ago for this very reason.  Then a friend told me they had quit doing that so I went back about 2 weeks ago.  Unfortunately they're still doing it.  I brought it to my servers attention and he said \"Oh yeah, we're not supposed to be doing that.  I'll get you some more and I'll use gloves this time.\" Obviously, what goes on behind the scenes is probably much worse that this, but when they do it in front of you, it just makes you wonder how bad it really is behind the counters.  I'm done.  I wonder how many others observe this activity and just don't come back rather than saying anything.",

They have a good size menu, lots to choose from. Mostly breakfast fares but there are some sandwiches and entree salads as well. The first time I was there i had the corned beef and hash with eggs. It was homemade corned beef hash with big chunks of beef and potatoes. it was seasoned well and was agood portion of food. i also have tried their egg and ham hollandaise. hand-cut ham on top of english muffin and perfectly poached eggs on top. the hollandaise sauce was a little tangy for my taste but was still excellent. I tried my boyfriend's steak and eggs and the steak was really good. very tender and well seasoned.  their food is really great and they have a special menu coming soon for daily specials like homemade meatloaf and braised short ribs, etc. overall a great cozy place to have breakfast with excellent service and good quality food.  p.s. the restaurant owners informed me that they chose not to put televisions in their restaurant wc is amazing.. so many places now have tvs and are so distracting. wout them at least u are able to really enjoy the food and company.",

It is in the same shopping center as Off the Strip Just Real Food, which offers brunch but only on Sundays. It just opened yesterday and appears to already be a hit with the locals.  There is a wide selection of breakfast and lunch options but, as their name suggests, it is all about their steak and eggs. My husband ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak ($10.95), his usual order that is usually the determining factor in whether a breakfast joint is worth it. I ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles ($11.25).  Both dishes were huge and very filling. The chicken fried steak was good but, according to the husband, doesn't live up to his standards because the batter wasn't flavorful enough. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffles. The breast was moist and the batter was light and airy. The Belgian waffle was delicious as was the maple syrup.  The decor is nice with mosaic walls and flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The service was prompt and decent considering they just opened the day before. I give this place a 3  1/2 stars because it is definitely worth trying but I still prefer other breakfast/brunch places such as The Original Pancake House and The Egg & I. I do see this restaurant thriving in this area because I predict there will be regulars that will patronize this place.",

    "text": "Really long wait this morning. Orders were getting lost, customers were waiting a really long time, and there was lots of complaining from the cook. This is only my second chance to try this restaurant and will probably be the last. To start off my experience, my wife and I were asked to wait for a seat. Normally, this is no problem but I could see at least 4 tables that were clean and nobody sitting at them. Not a big deal as we were in no hurry.  We were seated and taken care of right away. We ordered coffee and water and needed a couple of minutes do decide on our food. My wife ordered the French toast and I ordered biscuits and gravy. For the next twenty minutes we listened to the cook argue with the waitresses and watched customers walk out the front door. Almost 30 ,minutes went by and our food finally arrived. I got scrambled eggs instead of over easy and the waitress fixed it right away. My wife's meal was warm but certainly not hot. As I dug into my biscuits and gravy, I was greeted by crunchy biscuits and a sad excuse for gravy. The biscuits tasted like the kind you would get in a tube of Pillsbury and I needed a knife to cut them. The gravy was clumpy and tasteless. I have been cooking gravy for many years and it looked like the flour, or mix, in this case was thrown in and not blended very well. This was, by far, the worst plate of biscuits and gravy I have every eaten. Biscuits and gravy is a relatively easy dish to do well and it says volumes when a breakfast restaurant cannot do it right. I did let the girl at the register know how disappointed I was with my breakfast and she took it off my bill. That was very cool. My first time to Rise and Shine was pretty good and the second was less than impressive. I was told that the reason the prices were a little high is because of the quality ingredients that were used. I would disagree. It seems like either corners are being cut or the cooks are not happy with their jobs. Either way, this will probably be my last adventure out of the way to come to Rise and Shine..",

There are only a handful of employees which equals a long wait for expensive mediocre food.  The first time I came here was on a Sunday morning so I chalked up the wait and the mediocre food to the fact it was Sunday morning. Today I arrived at 12:00 and waited for 20 minutes to be sat. I was rushed to order as soon as I sat down so I ordered and after an hour of waiting for our food I left the money for my drink on the table and left. I will not be returning and will stick to blueberry hill when  I'm craving breakfast food. If you have two hours to wait then go here but if not I suggest you go SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!",

The things is for the area they really have no competition.   I want this place to do well but it needs some improving. Either up portions or lower prices. Also sat down at 11:15am and food got to us at 11:55, seriously!! 40 min for an omelette. They also used to have fresh jam but yesterday it was regular plastic containers.",

I get a half plate of that and make a platter with some eggs, so I'm not too sugar-carbed out for the day.  Noise level is decent as long as they keep the radio down a bit. When it's too loud, the patrons get louder to talk over it... it's a never ending cycle. But it's very RARELY too loud, maybe 1 in 20 visits :P Only brought this up after going through the survey questions.  Also, would love to see them move the checkout register over to the door in the new wing to keep the Check-in crowd and check out crowd sperate. But it's worth the line, even if they don't. :)",

Our waitress wasn't the most friendly person but she was reliable and efficient. The menu is huge, however everything was a bit more expensive than I expected. For example, a plain waffle was like $9 but one with fruit was like $11. Considering it wasn't a specialty waffle or novel in any way, that seemed a bit much to me. Overall, everything was good, but not as over-the-top as the yelp reviews made it sound.",

There are also umbrellas on the ceiling which adds a nice touch to the room. I tried the chicken waffle and it was amazing. It's not spicy but the spice in it is really good. It gets your senses going. It came with biscuit but I got charged the gravy on the side and I was not told. If you want a satisfying breakfast, you cannot go wrong with this place.",

We got lousy sorry from the waitress no manager approached our table and no one even offered to take it off the check we had to tell the cashier to take it off cause we never relieved it. Not the way to treat loyal customers we had to go to Ikea so my husband could get something to eat   Update:  We returned to our usual schedule and had breakfast this morning.  The welcome when we first walked in was enough for us to know they made a mistake last time and they were glad we have them a second chance.  We love Annalisa the manager and our server Sara as well.   They made us feel welcome again and gave impeccable service.  Food was amazing.  Thank you for having us back again.

Pancakes were pretty good not great. Pretty busy but the waiter kept his cool was friendly and considerate . The layout of the restaurant wasn't well planned and they sat a family with two newborns in two carriers on the end where the waiters all entered their orders in an iPad on the wall so it was impossible for guests or staff to get through lol. The line to check out starts getting in the way of those waiting for a table and the staff and guests sitting  The cashier was barely alive lol and the host was frazzled. Hectic though so I feel bad for them. They should model after the busiest breakfast restaurant The Egg & I to better systemize everything.",

They have cute overhead umbrella flowers, and the rest of the decor is really homefeel like.   Our server was really friendly, but a tad slow on bringing back our drinks when the restaurant was not busy. She asked to refill coffee a few times and checked back with us with a smile on.   I ordered the Ham N Eggs Benedict which was very appetizing to look at, who doesn't eat with their eyes first? The ham to English muffin ratio was perfect and the hollandaise sauce was smooth and rich. The hash browns were more on the crispy side,which I prefer. Overall it was a great tasting meal. I would definitely order it again.   I recommend to definitely get the pot of bread, if your meal does not come with it. It's like a less sweeter version of a cinnamon bun in a cup. It was delicious. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. Honestly this bread along with another side choice, & a cup of coffee would be a perfect light breakfast.  It's a little ways out of the main city/strip but definitely worth it for some good old comfort food.",

The only odd experience was, our waitress served us caffeinated coffee when i specifically asked her for decaf. And the only reason we found out it was caffeinated was because I had asked for another cup since the coffee was lukewarm!! Lukewarm at 730am?! I've never been served lukewarm coffee!  When i questioned the coffee and asked her if it was decaf for sure,  she was hesitant and had to ask her manager...So this 3 star review is more for the experience with the waitress and coffee fiasco rather than the food...i will not be returning.",

The omelet was perfect and the hash browns had this amazing taste where you knew spices were involved.   Paris had bacon wrapped steak. Also amazing. We'll be back on every trip!",

A five and two year old and we had to share the adults' food to satisfy them?  And they normally leave food on the plate. The five dollar half waffle (not Belgian/huge/pick your adjective) was the biggest head scratcher. So much so that we asked the server if it came with anything else to which the answer was an apologetic \"no\". So either keep the kids at home (if able) or have them split an adult entree (which is well executed). Will we come back now that we know this?  That is a head scratcher too.",

Great service, Great food, etc... slowly it all started to diminish.  Our last visit was HORRIBLE, we waited forever for the not so busy waitress to take our order, then waited even longer for our food. Never received a refill of coffee the entire time we were there.  I asked the manager when we were leaving if it had changed hands, and he said no.  I wrote a comment card requesting the owner call me. never received a call. When I received their monthly email, I replied to it asking that someone contact me about the HORRIBLE service we received and still never received a call.. Instead they removed me from the email list, because that was the last time I received an email from them  There are MUCH better options in Southern Highlands, this place is WAY WAY overpriced for what you receive... Take your money some place else!",

The corned beef hash was made with real beef that did not come out of a can and the pot of bread was just fresh and warm and squishy and wonderful. We sprung for the French press coffee, which was fun, but then we followed up with just some of their regular house brew and it was just as good, if not better than the French press. We waited for over 40 mins on a Saturday morning, so be prepared. I think it was worth the wait though.",

There are upside down umbrellas and flowers hanging from the ceiling and the waitresses are dressed in pajamas. The entrance is a bit awkward, as you are greeted there and it is also where you pay so it can get a bit congested. We were greeted and seated within a few minutes.   We quickly decided on food and it was out within no time. My husband indulged in the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly and looked really good. I settled on the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. I was envisioning sliced steak on top of my Chiaquiles, as that would be the easiest way to incorporate steak into the dish. Imagine my surprise when I was served an entire steak on the side. However, the steak was a bit fatty and I didn't taste much spice or seasoning. The Chilaquiles were actually pretty good, but there was nothing special or exciting about the flavors. I thought it was a little weird that they served the salsa and sour cream in tiny dishes on the side. I would have liked those to be more incorporated in the dish. But, it was a large portion and I took half of it home. I also chose the Pot of Bread as my side and it was delightful. I loved the look of it when it came to the table. It is a little Terra Cotta pot with a nice fluffy piece of bread rising from it. This was probably the highlight of the meal. The bread had a nice streak of cinnamon flowing through it and was served warm with butter.   Rise & Shine is good and they do have some unique dishes on the menu, but there is nothing mind blowing or innovative about the flavors.",

I am glad it is in our neighborhood, and I think it has the potential to be a cornerstone business in our area of Southern Highlands. I typically order breakfast to go for my family...the same things each time, as we aren't to adventurous in the morning. I really enjoy the selection, location, customer service, and portion sizes, but I have had problems with the consistency in the preparation of dishes from day one.  Some times, our meals are spot on, and other times they are a complete miss. It is a mystery ever time I open the containers as to what we will get. Don't get me wrong...if I order biscuits and gravy, that's what will be in the box. I just don't know if I will have three-day-old microwaved biscuits or fresh. Also, tossing 4 slices of banger sausage into gravy does not a sausage gravy make. Southerners beware, this is pretty far from authentic. Chicken fried steak is pretty awesome every time. Good crunch and spice...huge portion!  I will continue to eat here, because let's be honest...my hangover is not going to feed itself.",

Last time I went the workers were not having a good day. There's no manager walking around to make sure everything is fine.  Based on last time I went I will not be going back at least for a long time. Hopefully they improve their food and service. I don't mind paying more for good taste and great service. Good luck if you like your steak medium rare.  I like their fresh juices.",

They revamped the menu so there are more food choices than there previously were. I love the steak and eggs but sometimes the steak will be over cooked or under cooked depending on the day who is making it. I would stay away from the poached eggs as they are normally undercooked as well. All in all if your meal is prepared right it is a great spot to grab a bite at. The manager doesn't share the wifi password which I find kind of odd, but to each their own. All the good servers usually get better jobs and move on so this place is usually stuck with the bottom of the barrel so to speak. Don't have high expectations coming here and you won't be disappointed, unfortunately I am stuck with this breakfast place until we get some competition on this side of town!",

This year, I googled \"best breakfast in Las Vegas\" and discovered this gem which was only about two miles from my hotel (South Point Resort and Casino).  All the superlatives you've read in the other reviews are absolutely on the spot True.  The decor is cheerful, the service is absolutely wonderful, and the food is very, very good.  I agree with Google that this is one of the best breakfast (and lunch) places in Las Vegas.  Twice I had the rib eye steak and eggs plus the \"pot of bread\".  Once I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs.  Both were great but I liked the rib eye even better.  I always order my steak medium rare and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was perfectly cooked to my liking.    Playing on the name of the restaurant, all the waitresses wear (modest) pajamas and each one is cheerful, knowledgeable, and attentive to your morning repast needs.  My friend and I ate here three mornings in a row and each time we were seated in Callie's section.  Waitress Callie is a sweet young darling who knows how to keep all her customers content.  Each time I visit Las Vegas, I will make a point to start my day at Rise & Shine - A steak & egg place.",

The only people giving this the rating over two stars are either too lazy to cook or don't know how to cook.   We live in the neighborhood and have been frequenting this place for over a year now. First and foremost, I dare you to try and get an order of eggs over medium! It can't happen. Either the staff doesn't listen or the cooks just can't cook. On our last two and final visits, the steak on both occasions was cross contaminated with some sort of fish product, perhaps salmon or lox I don't know,  and tasted like a salt lick and if you're not familiar with that it's for farm animals.   On our very last visit I order the loco moco special. The hamburger patty was so undercooked it was completely raw and I don't know that i will ever be able to eat hamburger again. The eggs were so undercooked they were runny after being asked for over medium, which has happened time after time. Eating here has turned into a bad experience. Not to mention our breakfast was over $44 for two people; steak and eggs and loco moco. It's absurd. We don't intend to ever go back.  The reality is if an IHOP or dennys opened up in the neighborhood this place would be out of business in a week.",

    "text": "Been here on 2 visits. The first one was 3 years ago or so and I recently came here because 2 of my friends raved about how good the chicken and waffles is. The first time I don't remember what I ordered but it was something from the steak and eggs side of the menu, wasn't really that good considering I can't remember what it was and it didn't bring me back. We had the pot of bread on both visits and yes it is good especially if you smother it with butter, but hey adding butter to anything makes it taste good. So the second visit my friend I shared the chicken and waffle. It was a huge piece of chicken breast on top of a waffle. The thing that stuck out to me was that the breading had a slight spice to it, very nice touch I must say.  I also like the fact they use a chicken breast which makes it easier to eat with a waffle and place both waffle and chicken on your fork. The is definitely a sharable portion as my friend and I were full afterwards.  It was pretty good, but nothing to make me drive all the way over here considering the location is all the way in Southern Highlands. One of my friend's who recommended it said it's better than Roscoe's chicken and waffles?! I've never had Roscoe's, but if Rise and Shine is a 3.5 in my book I can only wonder why people rave about Roscoe's?! If I wasn't too weight conscious I probably would of gotten a parfait as well. Our other friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and they said it was okay compared the pancakes at Baby Stacks.",

It has \"Steak & Egg\" in the title, I so of course I got steak and eggs (specifically, the bacon wrapped tenderloin steak).  The bacon was very fatty, the steak was dry.  It came with an open-faced omelet which had way too much mustard on it (why put mustard on an omelet anyway?).    We also got the pot of bread, which was a gimmicky idea, but not really that special in the end.  The service was very nice and friendly (which is why I'm giving this place a 3 rather than a 2), but I wouldn't come back.",

I immediately noticed it while the waitress was serving it. I mentioned it to her right away and took the plate back and replaced it with a fresh new plate. The ham was pretty good too. It was not dry and you can taste a bit of the char from the grill.   I especially loved their pot of bread. The presentation was something different (bread in a plant pot). The bread was so soft with a hint of cinnamon. Delish!   All in all even with the hair experience, it was not bad and will be back here.",

Todays visit specifically was the worst. It wasn't nearly as busy as we have seen but we still had to wait to be sat when the host could've easily put some pep in his step to get us sat sooner. Once he was done forcing small talk in the patrons who were paying he sat us and the waitress who we've had previously  (and was fine) didn't acknowledge us just keep looking extremely busy. I don't mind waiting but at least touch the table so it is not awkward when you finally do stroll up and act like we were just sat and hadn't been waiting for an extreme amount of time.   Now for the food part....each time I have tried something different. This time the steak was over done and the bermais (sp) sauce was sour. The woman next to me ordered the same thing and got salsa with her steak omelet and I am not saying it is the waitresses fault but I would've enjoyed it with mine but its my fault for not paying attention. My husband's chicken fried steak was burnt. Everything else like i said previously was just mediocre.   All in all good place. Just inconsistent.",

Its located in my neighborhood (Southern Highlands), WHoooo hooo for me.  Sometimes this place gets really busy, so there may be a bit of a wait.  When its nice outside, you can be seated in the outside area.    Great atmosphere &  friendly staff (dressed in PJ's).  I've been here a couple times and dishes with steak...super awesome.  I have yet to try waffles and pancakes.  But I've just been so successful with their steaks, I just order it every time.   Recently I realized that they had my ultimate favorite combo.  Ribeye steak & Chillequiles.  Wooo woot!  I like their bread in a pot & fresh squeezed orange juice to compliment my food.  I like to pull out the whole bread and pour the cream cheese frosting all over like a cinnamon roll.  Mmmm Mmmmm  Prices are major for breakfast, but their portions are rather generous.  So, yup, split the plate and bill with your breakfast/brunch date.",

Upon arrival to our table, our server, Ashley was attentive, personable, intentional, and her customer service was A+. I got my go-to favorite kind of breakfast: rice, spam, and egg over medium.

We sat near where they toasted the bread. Here's my complaint... some of the girls that handled the toast did not use gloves, tongs or even paper while handling the bread. This visit I watched all the waitresses and waiter make their toast, there was 3 girls in particular that used their bare hands the entire time and served the bread straight to their tables that way.... uh... GROSS! But kudos to the ones that did use the tongs and didn't use their bare hands. I have been in the food industry for a while and cross contamination this is a big no no for me.   Here's my experience on the 2nd visit. Thank God It wasn't busy, we were seated right away. Our server was ON POINT this visit. Very friendly and thorough with our order, used tongs with our toast (5 stars for him!) and he checked on us every now and then if we needed anything without being annoying. Lol Before he served us our plates, he had gloves on putting all the finishing touches to our plate. He made this visit worth coming back. Thank you Gilbert for the excellent service!!! Hopefully we can ask for him all the time.   I love how the staff is dressed in their pajamas. It really does fit the name for Rise and Shine. Love the flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling too! In my opinion, the price is a lil high for the food BUT.... you are paying for the experience and someone is cooking you a great meal. 5 stars to the Chefs for making me the steak, avocado and mushroom/spinach omelette. My food was cooked to perfection. The food actually tasted better since they weren't crazy busy. I don't even eat hash browns but man.... it was seasoned well and had the crisp to it, I ate it and that's rare! On yelp, I kept seeing everyone post the Cup of Bread and of course.... it was delicious! I think everyone should order that when they come to visit this place.  I will be back for sure! So glad it's close to my place too! Thank you Rise and Shine!",

I'll def come back :)",

You can tell this restaurant is very laid back as the waitresses were all wearing PJs. It kind of threw me off when I first saw it but I suppose it's their uniform and it goes with the breakfast theme.  The service was okay nothing too impressive about it. The food was okay too.  I got a Belgian waffle and a side of fries. Yeah, very healthy breakfast. The waffle was the only thing on the menu that interest me. It was too soft for my liking. It just felt like I was eating a pancake but in a waffle shape. I did like that they put the butter on the side in a separate container and also asked me before hand if I wanted whipped cream. I order fries because there's this other brunch place my boyfriend and I like to go to and their fries are so amazing that whenever I visit I always eat there. Sadly, the place is on the other side of the town so I decided to curb my carvings by getting fries here. The fries here are very thin and didn't really impress me.",

I thought since it was a Sunday, there would be a whole lot more people, but we surprisingly got seated right away. We looked through pictures on their Yelp before we got here, so we already knew what to order.  I got the Fancy Steakhouse Omelette while my boyfriend got the Ultimate Steak & Eggs! Both came with a side of hash browns and your choice of pot of bread, toast or biscuit. Of course, we chose the pot of bread and as expected, it tasted heavenly! I could honestly keep eating their pot of bread forever!  As for our main meal, it definitely did not disappoint. I loved my omelette along with the strips of steaks on top; it was just a great combination overall! The only thing I would suggest is for them to go easy on the pepper.  Our server and the rest of their staff were very friendly. I'm actually jealous that their servers get to wear pajamas to work, so lucky! Anyway, I would highly recommend this place to everyone and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place is super cute and definitely pleasing to the eye. The decor in there is so cute and the way the servers wear pajamas is adorable. They have an abundance of good breakfast items on the menu, even beyond their steak and eggs. I decided to try the red velvet pancakes because of my sweet tooth, and they came with a side of bacon and eggs. It was all good but nothing to write home about. I still enjoyed them tho and they were very fluffy. It was a giant serving tho with just two pancakes and my sister and friends helped me eat them.  I tried my sister's steak and it was delicious. If I ever decide to go again I'd probably get that instead. I guess that's what they're known for since it's in the name!  Besides the food that didn't really blow me away, the service is what is making me take away stars. Wow, our server was acting so strange in a way. I work in the food and beverage industry and hate saying things like that. But seriously in my 21 years of life I have never had such weird service...  One of our girls asked for butter for her waffle and our server (a girl, don't remember her name) looked disgusted and pointed to my other friend's butter and said \"there's butter right there.\" Acting super confused. ew?? She wanted us to share butter? That's so gross...she had dipped her used knife in it obviously! Then my sister asked for water and once again the server pointed to someone else's water!! Is this like a communal place where we all share food? Then my sister orders salsa for her steak and eggs, and it's put on my plate of pancakes. Good combo. Also, my pancakes came with a special syrup, and it was delivered 10 minutes after my pancakes were. Oh, and that \"fresh\" butter my friend ordered? Came when she was halfway done with her meal. Okay so our server was very unfriendly and acting odd but once the bill came, she asked us how we were for the first time, asked if we were visiting, etc. I get it, you want a nice tip lol. After that experience I really have no desire to return.",

    "text": "Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive.   Here's the rundown: French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee.   Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats.   Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious.   Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER.   Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)  Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm.   If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it.   I'm rating this a 5 star plus I'll definitely be back.",

It's just a bunch of stuff that has added up that gets them a bad review from me. And some of the stuff scares me to know if it was True or not.  To add; The last order I got they didn't give us a receipt that told us the break down, but If the steak and eggs are really as much as they say on the menu, they charged us 15$ for a simple salad with lettuce, chicken and a poorly sliced tomato. :(",

It was everything I thought it would be;  overpriced the food was great and not good at the same time with the drink delicious but small and the service was fantastic.  The waitress was friendly, helpful, and had recommendations as we had never been there.  She was very nice throughout.  I had a GoGo drink that was fresh juice and id say about 8 oz for $5.  Way to small but delicious.   Then i ordered the corned beef hash with bacon.  It was nothing short of fantastic!  3 poached eggs that were cooked to perfection with this dish.  This came with 1 small biscuit.  It needed 2 at that size.  My friend ordered a steak breakfast burrito with the steak done medium.  The sauce (like an adobo) was aweful.   The meat was super well done.  And as a hole it was terrible.  (Hate to say that about any dish) but she had about 1/2 and was done.   1 coffee as well.  Couldn't tell you about that as i don't drink much coffee.    Bill was $35 and i feel it just wasn't worth that price.   I would order the corned beef hash again as it was just amazing.  But that's it!  Hope this was helpful for anyone wanting to come here.",

    "text": "My husband, son and two friends flew into Vegas Sunday night.  We had a hard time trying to find food late and had to settle for a wing joint.  I opted not to have any food there and so by morning, I was starving.  Looked on Yelp and found this place.  Really cute decor and wait staff in PJ's,, very charming.  We had an excellent waitress that took very good care of us, always very attentive.  I would say the table ordered just about every type of breakfast for the table.  From pancakes, omelets, oatmeal, bacon/eggs and potatoes.  Everything was delicious and filling.  My meal came with the pot of bread which I loved.  Half cinnamon roll and half dinner roll.  Yummy, although is wish it was bigger.  My only negative is that I was a little pricey.  This place is in a shopping plaza not anywhere near the strip (which was our intention).  I felt I was a bit expensive for what I perceived to be a local place to dine.  Since we did eat late for breakfast we were good until, dinner, no lunch required!  Very filling!  If you want to splurge order the fresh squeezed OJ.  Pricey at $3.25 a glass but tasted fresh and it was fabulous!",

Saturdays and Sundays are usually their busiest time, and weekdays are a breeze to get in. We live down the street, and so we go here frequently. They recently opened another location in Summerlin, but we haven't been there yet. They used Summerlin as sort of a \"test\" for their new menu, tweaked it there, and then changed their menu at this location. We've had everything there...and I mean that. We used to go there basically every weekend. The french toast and pancakes are to die for, according to the kids. My new \"super bad\" food addiction is their fried chicken breast and waffle. They bring their syrup out in a warmed bottle and you can see the fresh cinnamon inside. Yum. The servers are very kind and they all dress in pajamas, which is a neat vibe. They also have hanging flower/umbrella decorations, and the walls have neat colors and decor. Their portions are huge, so that accounts for the average $15/per plate (that is an estimate on my part), and you have plenty for leftovers.   Oh, and the part I wrote above about the dirty utensils/plate? It happened once, and has never happened since.   Like I wrote, this place is really worth a try. You'll be glad you made the trip.",

Since their expansion I have been in 3 times and each time the service was slow, our servers seemed distracted and sometimes downright rude in pushing us to order something from the new juice bar. The food portions have been reduced and the quality of ingredients seems to have declined as well. My last visit was not at a particularly busy time but multiple tables were left uncleared and dirty. All in all the charm of this place has gone and it's a shame because this was once a True gem of the southwest valley.",

First, they told us there would be a 5-10 min wait but I counted at least 5 open tables plus the entire counter which was empty. Then, our waitress Cary (who obviously took her speed pill this morning) asked us for our drink order and before we even look at menu asked if we were ready to order???? (we've been sitting for maybe 1 minute) we told her we weren't ready and she said he'll give us another minute... No kidding! She came back maybe 40 seconds later... This went on through out the whole time we were there. Gave us the check when we were only half way through or meal, etc.  horrible, horrible service. She was not friendly, never asked how we were doing, just kept rushing us. I tipped anyway, only because I know the cooks and the busboy share it. P.S. the busboy was a new kid... Must be family related because he was SLOWER THAN MOLASSES!!!! No wonder they get behind even with half the tables open.   Been here many times before but this might just be our last :(",

They told us it was a 15 minute wait but was less than 10. We both ordered omelets which were good, not great. One was fluffy and the other was almost too done, should have a little consistency. The breakfast potatoes are bland. The pot of bread is good, cute idea. Service is really good, servers wear pj's as their uniform and are all sweet. Two omelets, a hot tea, and oj was $34 before tip, seems a little high for what it is. I'd go back but mainly for the convenience that it's so close.",

    "text": "This weekend was crazy!  Last night was a night full of libations and great friends.  This morning I woke up on my best friend's couch with an appetite.  I was told a little gem was right around the corner and that I really needed to try it out.  Why not?  It's time to grub!  The strip mall in Southern Highlands is such a wonderful mall with a lot of different businesses.  Restaurants, hair salons, gyms, you name it.  Very delightful.  Rise & Shine was located in the southwest corner of the strip mall next to Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  When we got out of the car, we saw a few families waiting outside, so I knew it was going to be good.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.  When you walk into this place, you are instantly taken to a whimsical story book.  The exposed air ducts are distracted by hanging umbrellas shaped and pictured like spring flowers.  The subtle orange and lime green walls are decorated with huge cow pictures.  The floor to almost ceiling windows are bordered by decorated clay mosaic-type arrangement.  This place is cute!  Our server's name was Lisa.  From the moment she greeted us, she was nothing but amazing!  Such an inviting personality and she really took the time to make sure our experience was top notch.  I LOVED HER!!  For starters, I got the fresh squeezed orange juice for $3.25 and the cup of coffee for $2.85.  Coffee was standard, however the OJ was out of this world!  Fresh squeezed is the only way to go!  You could tell it was authentic.  Not only was there pulp, there were also seeds in my drink!  LOVED IT!  For my meal, it was such a hard decision, but I decided with the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel for $13.50.  NY steak done the way you like it, over butter toasted bagel, topped with two eggs any-style, fresh spinach between the steak and bagel, hollandaise all over the place and hash brown potatoes.  OH-EM-GEE!!  I got the steak medium rare (the ONLY way to get it) and the eggs poached (duh, it's a Benedict!).  The steak was cooked perfectly with nice char marks.  The bagel served multiple purposes.  Not only did it create the Benedict, it soaked up any juices from the steak and hollandaise.  The spinach offered a light, crisp texture to the dish.  The hash browns were cut in big strips and cooked amazingly.  Browned with a crunch, but not dark enough to be considered burnt.  You break the yolk from the egg and mix it with the hollandaise sauce and it completely ties the dish together.  Hollandaise is not too lemony and not to runny.  On the top, they drizzle a little balsamic glaze which offered a slightly sweet and tangy element.  This dish was AH-MAZE-ING and I will highly recommend it to anyone!    You guys, this place was out of this world!  So worth the wait, so worth the future drives (I live close to Boulder City).  I kept telling my best friends that this place was the perfect end to an epic weekend.  I truly believe it and think you need to stop reading this already and get your butt to Rise & Shine!",

Not wanting to hit any of mainstream eat spots in the area, we basically stumbled onto this place.  Upon entering Rise & Shine, one might think they have stepped through the looking glass.  There are upside down daisy light and daisy fans.  The windows are surrounded by mosaic tiles.  The smell of sweet cinnamon lays heavy in the air.  Everyone from the manager to our waitress, April were unbelievably pleasant.  The menu though basic in it's appearance contains some very interesting items.  Some of which we were able to sample today and look forward to sampling some others in the future.  The meals consisted of a Steak Benedict served on your choice of a plain or everything bagel.  Another plate of goodness was the French Toast coated with Cinnamon Crunch.  It normally comes on a raisin bread but we opted for Crunch coated Texas Toast...Awesome!  My only negative remark was that the poached egg on the Benedict was was not runny.  I addressed this with both the Manager and the Waitress who apologized and offered to make it right.  I chose not to make a big deal out of it and continued eating.  The steak by the way was Awesome!  I highly recommend the \"Bread Pot\" it was absolutely delicious and a fine addition to what ever you might order.  This is indeed a classy breakfast joint that I would not mind in the future making the drive to all they while passing about a dozen \"greasy spoons\" to get to.",

    "text": "Been to this spot twice and will be regulars soon enough!  Food is great, atmosphere and location is great, and you won't find another place like it in town. The servers dress in pajamas, which makes you feel relaxed. Each time I've come to eat here, my friends and I go in our pajamas as well. They fit groups of two to eight and more if needed. I've ordered the chicken and waffles, the french toast, the hash browns, and omelets, and everything is exactly what you expect it to be and then some. Food comes out fresh and hot, they work well with substituting items, the french press coffee is a must, and their prices reflect the quality of food.  First time I went there, it was with my boyfriend and we just wanted a nice breakfast spot nearby. We yelped this location, and gave it a try. We were greeted at the door, and were sat immediately. The place wasn't that busy a little after noon. The server was friendly and knowledgable. She explained certain items on the menu that we weren't familiar with, and gave our order. They brought us complimentary fresh cinnamon bread in clay flower pots that were amazing, and we ended up ordering another, which was a mistake because when our food came out, the portions were huge. We were so full, everything tasted wonderful, and the server didn't bother us too much but checked on us often enough. She gave us our check, and we paid when we were ready to leave. Between the two of us, the bill came out to about $30 not including tip. Which I think is fair for the amount and quality of food we had.  I definitely recommend this place.",

It would be so nice to walk to weekend brunch but can't say I'll do that because this place isn't that good. I'd rather drive somewhere with better prices and better food. The chilaqules were the best thing that we had. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was horrible. Cold, dry, thin and stale texture. The chicken was good but not great. I didn't like their maple syrup, it had cinnamon in it and with chicken? Yuck. I ended up pulling it off and eating it alone. I asked for blue cheese dressing so I could salvage my meal and dip the chicken in it and all they had was cheap bottles ranch style dressing. The service was the worst part of the whole experience. The server treated us like we were bothering her and she was missing half the time...like seriously missing like not in the room or the kitchen.",

    "text": "Went this morning for the very first time. Items ordered:  the ultimate (3 eggs and 8 oz ribeye), and the eggs Benedict. After learning what the \"pot of bread\" was, we ordered one of those as well. We also had the French press coffee. Love, love that they use Illy coffee. So good.  I admit to having been nervous about the eggs Benedict, because they use ham instead of Canadian bacon, and the menu also noted it had balsamic vinegar on it. Don't get me wrong, love balsamic, just never had it on eggs Benedict.  Food arrives. Yum!!  Best eggs Benedict I think I've ever eaten. The ham was very flavorful and tender, and the balsamic drizzle added just a little touch of flavor.   My hubby's steak tasted great and his eggs were cooked perfectly.   Hash browns were also very good. Nice potato flavor and not overly crispy.   The pot of bread was marvelous. It's described as a cross between a cinnamon roll and dinner roll. To the previous reviewer who complained that it tasted \"yeasty\"....um homemade bread is supposed to have a yeasty flavor.   Decor was nice and loved the servers wearing jammies.  They were all friendly and seemed happy to be there. Only complaint was it felt awfully warm in there, but maybe that was from all the yummy food being prepared.   Will be back, and definitely recommend!",

I would of asked for a new breakfast but my server only came to my table twice, to take my order and to give me my check. She wasn't even the one to bring me my food.

We ordered to go over the phone. It was a corned beef hash, a salmon Benedict, and a bagel with cream cheese for my mother. So, now we're home with our food and the bagel we paid for isn't there. I guess that's our fault for not checking the bag. The corned beef hash is fine. The salmon Benedict is bad. Not that any particular ingredient is, just the dish as a whole was bad. I Never send food back but had I been in the restaurant I would have asked to change my meal. So I sit at home now with a dish I cannot eat and my mom doesn't have her breakfast. I guess we will just get dressed and go out to eat something :(",

As of late, the quality of food isn't the same.  I've always replaced hashbrowns with fruit (strawberries, blueberries, and bananas), and the serving has always been generous.  The past 2 times they've put the fruit in the smallest dish, almost like a dish that you usually get syrup in.  It's been about 1/4 of what I used to get.  Then today, first thing this morning, they ran out of bananas.   I don't believe their eggs are organic anymore, they're just different!  I don't mind spending the extra money for quality, but it's just not quality.  Also, they recently changed the coffee, and my husband doesn't care for it at all. The service is still awesome, we love Riley!  Please stop cutting corners, we will go elsewhere if things don't improve",

Nice little gesture to make you feel at ease and that you don't have to take things too seriously.  We arrived and were told that the omelets are great, the Pot'o'Bread is THE BEST, and that the steak n eggs are pretty bomb.   Well, what was told is pretty much truth. I got a pretty hefty and filling omelet, the wife got the steak n eggs, and we all got Pots o Bread.  Now I have to say - the PoBs were a little underwhelming. Really cool concept, fun little quirk to have as a staple of your establishment... but too me, there wasn't enough cinnamon and there wasn't quite enough flavor. But still! The texture was great and it was really fun to enjoy.  The servings are all pretty big as both the lady and I had to take our food to go [and I'm a pretty hefty eater]. The steak that she got was more fatty than we'd prefer, but there was still a substantial enough amount of meat for us to enjoy.  The service here is great, everyone is friendly, and you feel very welcomed to enjoy a good time at Rise & Shine. Not bad, you guys, not bad at all.  Come here if you want something off the strip, not nearly as noisy, and a good time.",

If you leave this place hungry something is wrong with you.  My husband had the steak and eggs  and I had just over easy eggs and some biscuits and gravy.  Before our breakfast we had the pot of bread cinnamon yumminess!  All I can say is who ever thought of that pot of bread is some kind of genius.  We watched the diners to the right IOC us order the breakfast burrito and waffles (1 person) and he ate it all!  When we come back to LV ...and we will come back, this place is definitely on our list of places to revisit.  Staff was super friendly and in the PJ's made it so cool.  Some how we managed to eat it all. We were not leaving one bite of that goodness behind.",

Then the kids meal didnt even included a drink which every other restuarant they do and other restaurants will accommodate children as well like why couldn't we switch out the egg for hashbrowns when we are paying 7 bucks for the meal plus another 3 for her drink seems ridiculous to me could barely get a refill of coffee and while I was still eating my eggs and hashbrown Sharon took my plate of food not even asking if I was finished I guess like her way of telling me I was done idk odd rude behavior my husband had the carne asada chilaquiles and it had half the amount of meat then the last time we went and chips were soggy my brother had a steak which was so over salted it was hard to eat he said my country fried steak was over cooked and lacking flavor so this was a horrible experience and ruined my daughters graduation breakfast we had hoped for an amazing time there and sadly service and food has gone downhill since our last visit our tip to the server dont pre judge someone who you clearly have no idea where they work. This place needs to get it together and actually make sure they have servers that are not acting like the one we had today it was absolutely horrible and we came to celebrate our daughters graduation. The cashier was friendly and did ask how things were I said ok and he did ask just ok and I told him bad service and some other things he did say he would note it all down but did nothing to try and make the situation better for us. Also make sure the food is consistent probably wont be back really did like this place before thou.",

The colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and the pj wearing waitresses give it such a fun vibe.  We were greeted and seated with our waitress over in a flash.  She was friendly and attentive.  My coffee was always full of their wonderful Lavazza.  Mmmmm. Coffee.  I felt I was a broken record always ordering the same thing.  So to change it up, Blueberry Pancakes it is!  Was it a good choice?  Absolutely.  The blueberries were sweet and abundant.   The pancakes were thick and huge.  I couldn't finish but about half of my plate.  They had a light dusting of powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top.  My husband happily ate the cream for me.  I realize it is a steak & egg place but their pancakes are just as good.    My better half ordered the Grilled Steak & Chorizo Burrito.  Of course I had to try a bite.  It was really stuffed full of ingredients.  Along with the grilled onions, beans, egg and chorizo~ the jalapenos gave it a nice kick.  I love spicy so it works for me.     They have so much more on the menu that I would love to try.  Thanks for great start to my day!",

Being in the business we understand this so we didnt think it was a big deal. Our server takes our order which was 2  med rare ribeye steaks with scrambled eggs.  We get our drinks and then we wait. And we wait. And we wait. Now we watch tables who have come in after us and order after us get food. Also to go orders are being sent out but still our food isnt out. Now at nearly 40 minutes I ask how many orders in front before we get ours, I get told there are still 2 more checks ahead of us as they are only working on one check at a time......  now I get being a bit more cautious and slow around the health dept. But one ticket at a time is a joke.  Finally our food arrives and the steaks are charred on the outside and tough as hell to cut. And my scrambled eggs are runny as hell. And I dont mean fluffy and soft I mean liquid runny. Gross! All I ate was my toast.  My husband ate his as he was starving. But I couldn't do it.  The server couldnt apologize more and it really wasn't her fault. She sent someone over with a 5 dollar coupon to apologize but sadly we wont be back, as this was the third time we had a food issue at this location, last 2 times it was our steaks had to be sent back because instead of mid rare we got well done, and on the second send back they were raw.   Its a real shame because this place was great but after multiple food issues and now I spent an hour there to have coffee and toast I feel the need to move in to a better breakfast place.",

I showed up around 11:00-12:00 and was seated within 4 minutes, including table clean up. The place is reminiscent of an old school eatery, yet still modern. The staff is dressed in pajamas, which sets a nice lazy easy going morning vibe. I ordered a fresh squeezed glass of OJ which was nice! Followed by my main order of the ULTIMATE steak & eggs with hash and a \"Cup of Bread.\" I've never even heard of this sweet before, until the server described it to me. It was definitely one of the best treats I've ever eaten! (coming from a guy who doesn't usually order sweets) the steak was asked to be cooked medium rare and the chef did an AMAZING job at doing so. Hash had some nice little char to it, which I loved. Eggs cooked just right. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Rise & Shine has become our go-to breakfast/brunch spot for birthday celebrations.  The Husband celebrated his birthday last weekend and they brought out a chocolatey fudgey pancake topped with whipped cream and sprinkles and of course, a candle.  The Little Gal ended up eating just about the whole thing, which we were super pleased about.  And the Little Guy proclaimed we should celebrate all birthdays here! (This was actually the third time we've eaten here, but the second time we celebrated a birthday.)  On my last two visits, I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash & Eggs.  It comes with three eggs your way and a pot of bread, toast or biscuit.  Their corned beef hash has quite a bit of potato in it, and it's pretty yummy.  I'm glad I ordered it again and ate it all up. I chose the pot of bread this time and it reminded me of a cinnamon roll with the frosting dip on the side.  The Husband ordered the Lox & Cream Cheese Omelette.  He was a bit surprised to see the lox just sitting on the top of the omelette when he expected it to be folded in somehow.  He liked the dijon-cream cheese that was on there and needed to request more though.  Service was good the last two times we went, especially when we had Christine.  I just remember her being an awesome waitress who was super attentive, personable and energetic.  She was also quite efficient too!     I will admit that our very first visit was years and years ago.  I don't remember how the service was then, but did remember (I started a review a long time ago.) what we ate then. We ordered the New York Steak, Spinach & Benedict-Bagel, Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles, and Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak. The eggs were more medium when we ordered them over easy.  The steak wasn't very flavorful despite it being spice rubbed.  I realized I was looking for some kind of sauce to dip the steak in.  The chicken fried steak was also huge.  The pot of bread was good then, but a bit under baked since it was still doughy.  Our last two visits this year was a better experience than our very first time.  It wasn't necessarily bad then, it was just okay.  They are obviously doing well since it's busy and they have a second location.  There's usually a wait on the weekends, but we arrive later than most so it's not too long.  The decor is adorable inside.  I do tend to notice there are quite a few tables that need to be cleared and I think if they were cleaned up more efficiently, the wait could even be less.",

Hubby ordered their Ultimate steak and eggs which comes with a ribeye, eggs, and hash browns.  I ordered their special which was Southern friend chicken breast and biscuits with eggs.  I was so happy when it came out, I couldn't wait to dig in.  I fell in love at first bite!    We definitely will be stopping by again whenever we make it out to Vegas.",

This restaurant is located in Southern Highlands, a super nice, relatively new neighborhood in Vegas.   We each ordered the short stack of pancakes platter with the choice of bacon, banger sausages (what we both got), or turkey kielbasa and two eggs.   We decided to get a side of tomatoes to get some veggies, as well as a pot of bread to try. I also ordered a cup of coffee (they brew ILLY coffee - THE BEST!).  I had no idea what a pot of bread was, so this was the best way I could describe it: It's like a cinnamon bun, without being sweet, and served with preserves. I thought it was delicious and appreciated that it wasn't terribly sweet. Also, it comes in a little flower pot. SO adorable.   Also, our waitress was kinda amazing. One of the nicest servers I'd ever seen in Vegas. She kinda reminded me of Shania Twain (random I know). She seriously kicked ass, and did a great job of taking care of us.   Just a couple of minor things I would have Rise And Shine work on: -My banger sausages (DELISH) were warm but not hot -The prices here are a little more expensive   A few things on my list to try next time: -2 cup French Press Illy coffee -Steak and Eggs -- this is their signature dish -Hash Browns - seems like everyone had this and I had major food envy",

Even the hash browns which I'm really not normally a fan of....was so delicious that I almost finish the whole thing!  I have a rule of generally not visiting the same place twice in a trip I would stop here again and have order the same exact items again and stuff my face! love this place but it gets busy.",

It's amazing this place runs like it does considering its owner was a big strip vp of f and b with Caesars corp. There is zero leadership in this place. Absent owner.   Arrive. Dirty tables everywhere; but have to wait 15 minutes for a table. It's Sunday folks staff accordingly. Finally seated. Menus are laminated; all of the laminated corners are peeling back and dirty.   Server shows up after we sit for 10 minutes and says sorry I will be back. 5 minutes later takes a drink order. Cloudy old iced tea. Gross. No sweet and low on table. Had to ask for it.   We order our food. Takes 15 minutes. We watch as dirty tables around us sit dirty for up to 20 minutes as they have a wait list. What a shame.   Ordered chicken sandwiches. Comes out with what looks like a 3-4oz half chicken breast on a big bun. Hardly sized properly to fill the bun. Plate smoking hot with the lettuce and tomato sitting directly on the hot plate. Now cooked and wilted. Comes with nothing? No mayo? Nothing?? Fries cold and a very small portion. Embarrassing. Asked for mayo to put on the sandwich. Also ordered a French onion soup. Came out with our sandwiches rather than before. Soup had so much thyme in it......tasted like a beef broth thyme soup. Gross. Went to get ketchup from the condiment caddy and it was empty.   This place is dirty. Lacks the basics. Server was scatter-brained. No management presence. Bussers moving at a snails pace. Cooks eating behind the line. We rode our bikes to lunch. When leaving we saw two servers out back smoking. One was our server. Now I know why she was not around and why we waited so long. Wonder if she washed her hands.   I guess three times is a charm. We want this place to be great because it's so close. Not again. Shame on you owner; you know better.",

The servers all wear pajamas, upside down umbellas hang from the ceiling and its very quirky in decorations.  The service was good with her continually asking if we need anything and bringing drinks. only issue was he ordered a biscuit and got served sourdough toast.  There aren't many healthy options on the menu so I got a cobb salad minus a few things. They were good about putting my bacon on the side for him.  It was very good with a nice balance of all the ingredients and not too heavy on the dressing.  It was huge though and I couldn't finish it all so we switched plates....lol.....he got the bacon wrapped steak and eggs and he enjoyed it, only thing left on his plate when he gave it to me were the hashbrowns.  The bread is simple bread as not a fan of the pot of bread as not enough cinnamon gooey-ness if I am going to splurge.  The guy who you go to in order to pay wasn't sure what to make of our sense of humor but he was very polite and efficient. Last time I was here I got the fruit which is nicely cut up and a nice size portion.  I would go back as convenient and good options for kids too.",

Selection and prices were reasonable. I ordered corned beef hash and eggs with a pot of bread. I've never heard of a pot of bread so I ordered it. What came was a dinner and cinnamon roll baked together served in a pot and it was served with jam and butter. Surprisingly good and I wanted more! Service was extremely friendly and attentive.

OK so what is the problem? well two people for breakfast one being oatmeal was $35!!! My bagel with steak was overcooked and soggy hash brown and overall tasteless. They had to come out 3 times for my wife's oatmeal cause first trip they forgot the milk and fruit, then came the milk and forgot the fruit...mind boggling incompetence and they did this every single time we have been there so she can't start her breakfast and just sit there sometimes for 5 minutes! oh I ask for a large orange juice with two straws so the waitress decided to change it to a carafe and charged us $8.8!!! We are not complainers but this time like one time a year ago we said something and did anyone did anything? NOPE! what they do is to hand you a discount coupon, not write off the juice or anything , so the moral of their customer service is  TOO BAD BUT UNLESS YOU COME BACK, YOU MEAN NOTHING TO US SO HERE IS A COUPON FOR NEXT VISIT AND IF YOU DON'T COME BACK, THEN WHO CARE! That is the message, perhaps I should have left a note for the waitress, and say SORRY FOR NOT TIPPING BUT IF YOU DO IT RIGHT NEXT TIME I WILL TIP YOU!  Wonder how they would like that. I handed back the $5 coupon and said we won't need this as we will NEVER be back. we left a tip anyway, not that she deserve it cause when you can't serve oatmeal, you really need to think about a different profession!",

    "text": "I've been here several times in the past and the food and service was great. What happened? Ordered coffee and very strong and smelled burnt. Ordered a latte instead and it seemed as if they just added water to it and almond milk which was not enough to cover the watery side of the coffee. We sent it back. Granted we were not charged for it but at the same time we could not enjoy coffee with our breakfast. They definitely needed a barista in their restaurant. Very disappointing. Service was good as always but they must of had a turnover in chefs, or should I say kitchen help. Food was not what I expected. I ordered the regular chilaquilles with two eggs over medium. The order came and it was my two eggs As ordered and I was expecting some beans amidst all of the chips with very little cheese on them. Waitress came by and asked if we were OK I said I was hoping there would be some beans underneath all of the chips and she said yes they're usually beans at the bottom but my fork came up with a pureed red kind of sausage looking stuff. I said those were the beans? Not good in my book. The pancakes ordered by my wife and granddaughter were outstanding!  All in all the service was great, ambience was nice but I feel there should be someone overseeing the food coming out of the kitchen before it hits the table. And please hire a real barista. It would justify the high prices you're charging. Oh by the way, they wanted an extra $.65 for the almond milk in the latte. Really? Who nickel and dimes like that?",

I never add salt to my food but I did have to use 2 packs of it for this meal, the meal didn't have any seasoning or flavor, the egg were plain, the hash brown were good great but not much flavor, but the biscuits were nice fluffy and soft and the gravy was amazing and now that did have flavor, personally the biscuits and gravy were our favorite part.   The pancakes were huge so the 2 stack is more then enough. They're as big as someone's face. Lol. Those were nice, fluffy and soft as well.   Overall the food did its job and got us full and it was a challenge trying to eat it either. I wouldn't say I would not eat here again, it's more of a last resort for me. The prices aren't bad either.",

The ceiling is covered with colorful flower umbrellas and broken pottery on the walls, which creates a whimsical garden atmosphere. The uniforms for servers are matching top and bottom pajamas. Very unexpected, but hey! It works. Sit inside for the fastest service; the patio tends to lack attention from my experience.  Instead of breakfast, I ordered the GO GO Green drink, it had a hint of sweetness, which gave it the perfect balance. Highly recommended for a boost of energy and something light! Oh and dont forget the infamous bread cup! It comes out hot and fresh. The cinnamon bread is so soft and to top it all off it comes w/a side of frosting!! Who can resist?   If your in the southern highlands area and craving breakfast, check out this spot! Great food and service. The only thing missing is mimosas and bloody mary's! Rooting for an all you can drink brunch some day!",

    "text": "Review #100 goes to Rise and Shine! Their website is called \"bestbreakfastvegas.com\" for a reason! After a stressful morning, we decided to try out Rise & Shine for a nice brunch away from the madness of the Strip. So glad I found Rise & Shine from all of the positive Yelp reviews! We were promptly greeted and shown to our table.    Based on the other diners' pictures, I knew I had to try their French Press coffee. I love when restaurants offer this! They brought out my coffee with a timer, showed me how to use it, and I waited for it to brew. The coffee was delicious and was about 3 cups of coffee!   For my meal, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken + Eggs, because buffalo chicken is my favorite food and who else puts buffalo chicken on a breakfast menu?! It did NOT disappoint. I was served two large, super crispy chicken breasts covered in delicious buffalo sauce, two eggs of my style, and freaking amazing hashbrowns. You know how lots of places give you bland, soggy hashbrowns? Not here. The hashbrowns are extra cripsy and loaded with flavor from the green onions. I also had my choice of toast, biscuit, or bread in a cup? Obviously I chose bread in a cup. The bread in a cup is basically an adorable little cinnamon roll baked in a coffee mug with a side of icing. How fun! This meal was seriously my brunch dream come True!   My boyfriend had the giant three little pigs bagel with bacon, ham, banger sausage, egg & cheese with hashbrowns. I didn't have a bite, but you can see from the photos that the bagel was massive! You certainly will not go hungry here.   Check out Rise & Shine ASAP for an amazing and affordable brunch in Vegas. This place was much better than any meal we had on the Strip in terms, of taste, price, and service. The staff was warm, inviting, and helpful. They also work in pajamas, which is adorable. One wish: I saw on Yelp they used to have a delicious looking buffalo chicken wrap, but it is no longer on the menu, so I think it may have been taken off. They should definitely bring it back if so! Thanks to Rise & Shine for a great meal!",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times than I have ever checked in,  so don't let my 5 check ins fool ya. I'm a semi regular.  Food is 4/5. There are times when they have their misses, but I still come back so it must say something about the food as well. My main go to is their steak and eggs. Followed by their banana frosted flakes crusted french toast platter. Next is their country fried steak if I want to indulge l. Also, can't go wrong with their bacon, mushroom and swiss steak burger with shoestring fries. I hate shoestring fries normally but theirs comes out well seasoned and crispy. The missed part is their loco moco and eggs plate... that's the white washed version. It's basically teriyaki sauce mixed with brown gravy... no bueno. But major plus for them adding rice to their menu! I sometimes crave rice and before they didn't so I would make the trek to Egg and I, but now I don't have to as much.  Service would depend on the server. 3 to a certain server who always forgot my friends food orders while everyone else got theirs. She still works here so I won't mention her name as it was in the past, so I always avoid her if I can. I miss my other server, though it has been a while since I've seen her due to the fact she was going to be on maternity leave and that was months ago. I enjoyed her because she always remembered that I am a tea junky. She would have my iced tea ready the moment she sees me in her section without asking me for it. I miss that. Now my new favorite server is Jerry. His service alone is what brings me back all the time. Very personable and he always accommodates my requests. There are two types of servers I like, one that can upsell the shyt out of their menu and the ones that allow me to enjoy what I want to eat based on their available items. Like today he was very accommodating. I was in the mood for chicken and waffles (before I didn't care for their chicken and waffles because in the past though the size and portion was great, my friends always commented it was bland) I have not ordered chicken and waffles from here in a while and I was craving something spicy so I asked Jer to have the chicken tossed on their buffalo sauce. And I am not one of those customers who expects things for free with any modifications that I specifically request for. I know there's an upcharge, so no need to tell me. I will pay for what I asked for since you know it's not in their menu description. Very irritating to see and hear a guest (from previous dining experiences everywhere) that berate the server for not telling them that what they're requesting for that is NOT listed on the menu description that they would be CHARGED for it.   I am very happy to hear that they added mimosas and cocktails to their menu, finally... just disappointed it's not bottomless. Arrgh!  Technically with some of the misses I would say this review would be better as a 4.5 but as you know, Yelp! doesn't allow for half stars.",

Apparently there are three different locations throughout the valley- with this location being the one that doesn't serve alcohol- so be aware.  We opted to sit outside since we had our fur baby with us. With that said, we were seated right away. Gelato was super attentive and made sure we were seated with the quickness. She was great at providing recommendations for both drinks and entrees. My husband went with her recommendation for The Chilaquiles with the rib eye along with the strawberry/watermelon lemonade. My hubby's breakfast was on point. The drink was super refreshing and the Chilaquiles?! Boyyyyy, this dish was cheesy and full of flavor! I ordered The Ultimate Rib Eye breakfast platter. This came with 2 eggs, hash browns and side of bread.  Here's the thing, customer service?! Great 5 out of 5 stars, the steaks on the other hand?? Hummmm...Questionable. We had ordered our steak medium-rare, butttttt they were totally over cooked. Be sure to order your steak one level less than what you want or else it'll be over cooked.   This is a place I will try once, then that's it.   Thanks again to Gelato for the great customer service, we may return just to visit her but otherwise....",

Our server was not happy, and her bored/grumpy demeanor was a bummer. Maybe it's a good thing we hardly saw her.   I got the Chilaquiles, which were very very salty. My \"over-easy\" eggs were rock-hard, and the whole dish was room-temperature, not hot.  My friends basic egg dish came with a bread option, and this being her first time, chose the pot of bread. It never came out - even with several assurances that it would be out shortly.   There were no refills on coffee or soda.   I have had very good food and service here, but not in a while.

Food: You got to try the bread/cinnamon roll in a cup. Buttery yumminess!! The freshly squeezed orange juice is the best.  I enjoyed the rest of my meal but the hash browns were over done and the eggs could have been a bit fluffier.  I've had pancakes, waffles, grits, bacon, biscuits, sausage and omelets before which were all yummy as well.  Their menu is pretty big and it will satisfy most diets.  This place is a go to each time I'm in town and want to get away from the strip.  The price point for the food is fair and you will be satisfied.",

She took our order in the best efficient friendly manner and brought drinks right away! The food came and was worth the wait. Huge plates.  The buffalo chicken is not a sandwich but a huge piece of chicken with buffalo sauce on it. Country style which means fried.  The steak chilaquiles is chilaquiles and a big piece of steak. The steak was cooked well and spiced delicious.  The burrito was delicious but very spicy so beware! There is jalapenos inside the burrito.   This place is very good and great place for breakfast! We were all full and worth the drive!",

    "text": "The most important part of the day is having a huge breakfast to hold you over for the day. My fiance and I have tried many places for breakfast and brunch. Normally they come out with being too little for a hefty price or not enough to fill our stomachs until the next meal.  Low and behold, Rise and Shine gets the award for good prices and ginormous everything. Being it was the first time here, but looking at the pictures on Yelp, everything looked delicious. We came in around 11 AM. There were only a few customers and we waited only a few minutes to be seated. This was ok with us as this place completely had a warm feel to it. From tables and booths to the uniquely hung flowers/umbrellas. It makes you feel at home.   After being seated we met our server Jerry. Looking through the menu, they are known for their steak and eggs. However, the menu goes from the classic section, pancakes, French toast, waffles, and more. They also specialize in pressed juices orange, strawberry and watermelon, apple to name a few. We finally decided what to order. I ordered the banana frosted flake pancakes (4) with plattering it (eggs your way, mine were sunny side up. With your choice of meat (chose the bacon of course)). Ordered the watermelon and strawberry, my two favorite fruits combined. My fiance decided to go with the pork carnitas chilaquiles with orange juice.   This gave us time to chat and not hurry as they did take their time to add love to their cooking. Our food finally came out, and let me tell you my jaw dropped literally to the table when they handed me my pancakes. I can say the pancakes were bigger than a human persons head. I thought to myself I should of stuck to two instead of 4. This all changed when I bit into the pancake. It was so fluffy soft, mixed in with the Frosted Flakes added a crunch to it. The best part of the pancake was the bananas were caramelized just like the plantains you get from most islands. Add the syrup, which is home made, I just was speechless. My fiance, liked the pork chilaquiles, but was lacking in the cheese, Rojo sauce, and needed more scrambled eggs. He finished his, and I finished half of mine. Another bonus factor, the pancakes were still good and lasted two additional days. The only thing was, I took away one start has the server was not as attentive to other places we have gone to.  Overall we left on a good note and will soon be back to try all the other delicious things on the menu.",

It is delivered piping hot with a cool three hourglass set: denoting three, four or five minutes. You get to choose the time. Also, they delivered the mug pre-warmed!  Little details like that make the coffee better.   Service was outstanding. A perfect amount of checking in and keeping the water glasses full. Very nice people.   I went a little crazy with my order... and I may have over indulged with the bagel, steak and poached eggs, but it was worth it. There was some spinach involved, so I was a little healthy.  These guys are definitely worth visiting!",

The orange juice was freshly squeezed. I got the crunchy cinnamon French toast platter with bacon. The bacon was crisp the way I like. I thought I wouldn't finish my French toast, but I ate every bite. The French toast and syrup isn't too sweet(which is a problem sometime at places). The French toast wasn't too doughy. The cinnamon crunch gave it an extra touch. I wanna go back to try more food and drinks! I give this place a thumbs up.",

Then the kitchen had a major role in us waiting 30 minutes after we ordered for the food to come out. It was not very busy, but they didn't seem to have enough wait staff on the floor to begin with. When our order was making our way to the table we could hear someone speaking very loudly to the kitchen about needing several egg orders. Lead me to believe the kitchen was backed up. The food looked great when it came out, the only sad thing was the eggs were over poached, so much so that it was just balls of hard yolk with some whites. I didn't send it back because we had already waited so long to begin with. I probably would think twice about going back to this location. The interior was cute and it was clean, the service and food is what was the most disappointing here. Kind of important to make sure those two things are lacking.",

The cup o bread was served piping hot immediately.  The iced mocha came with more whipped cream than mocha and was not well received.  Scrambled eggs served dead last, almost as an afterthought and they were stone cold.  We did send them back and quickly got a really hot plate of scrambled eggs!  The omelet was delicious, the burrito's chorizo had a different flavor than we expected but was nice and spicy.  Overall, we'd come back, maybe just to see the servers in their pjs.  The food was actually very good except the tiny missteps of eggs and mocha and that didn't really have anything to do with taste in the long run.",

Friendly staff and excellent food! Hugh portions, food came in hot. We started with the \"bread in a cup\" that was so yummy it had a cinnamon roll like texture! I had the steak and eggs chilaquiles, steak was a pretty good size and a perfect medium rare. Chicken and waffles were yummy too! Best piece of chicken I've tasted in awhile. Large piece deep fried crunchy coated chicken breast. This place does breakfast right. I'm assuming this is family owned which is great because they really care about the quality of the food.",

Our server Gelato was absolutely wonderful! She promptly came to our table and took our drink order answered any questions we had and was very attentive filling our coffee and water glasses throughout our meal. We will definitely be back and request to sit in her section! The food was excellent too.",

    "text": "Red Velvet Pancakes?! How original, I've never seen those on a menu until I dined at Rise & Shine. Unfortunately due to the 24 hour buffet pass I was only looking for a salad or something green. I'll have to try the red velvet realness on my next visit. I ended up getting a most delicious grilled chicken cobb salad. It was HUGE! It was one of the best cobb salads I've ever had it comes with ranch dressing and I did SOS sauce on side. Usually cobb salad comes with blue cheese which I thought was good until I had R&S grilled chicken cobb. My friend devoured the chicken wrap. He said it was very similar to McDonald's chicken wrap, which is discontinued, but better. Wish I had taken photos but we were all super hungry and had to eat and go quick.   Rise & Shine is a local breakfast joint where waiters and waitresses get on with their day in PAJAMAS! Wild. It's very family friendly, reasonably priced, and best of all the menu has a little something for everyone. There's a large variety of breakfast items as well as \"afternoon items\" which we had at 11:30am so I guess it's just what they call that section but doesn't mean you have to wait until noon. The interior is big and cool with a fun surprise on the ceiling. Everyone here has a great attitude, very friendly and attentive even when they're busy. You can call ahead of time and check out the wait time, it'll most likely be 5-10 minutes.   Parking is plentiful, but not really shaded... there are tons of other stores located in this shopping center such as a grocery store and other restaurants. Will definitely be returning next time I'm headed to Las Vegas!",

They just lost a customer due to this. Either I pay $5 to deliver this or I have to risk the chance of them getting hacked and my cc gets stolen. Tacky way to handle business. Will not be coming back. Rise and shine prices are high as it is. I don't like to deal with places that refuse to service their customers. Wow.",

The fourth time, they had pot-of-bread but were no longer offering the awesome homemade jam that used to come with it (another thing that made them special). All in all, the food is pretty good, but nothing different from the other tons of breakfast places in Vegas. They do have warm maple syrup, but I wouldn't be surprised if they soon got rid of that too. It's the little touches that can make places like these successful, but is seems they are moving in the wrong direction.  Note to the owner(s): bring back the homemade jam!!!",

Right away an experience begins with all the cute decor on through out the restaurant all the way down to the servers uniforms! PJ's! So very cute!!  Food!! I've had a few different items here but down to it all the crunchy French toast as a platter is the best thing every with banger sausage!! Mmmm!  Not only was the food amazing at each visit. But you can see it all being made in an open view to the kitchen! Nice and fresh no sitting in the window for 10min! From griddle to plate to my table. Yum!  I drive out of the way past eggworks and all that to go here simply for service and over all quality of their food(:  See in about an hour Rise & Shine.  P.s. Coffee is so yummi and strong definitely my morning pick me up.",

    "text": "First off, the main reason I took away one star was because it took 20-30 min to get seated. When I walked in there were so many empty tables. If anyone can justify the long wait, I will change my rating, but I don't understand why it would take this long.  BUT, I love how the waitresses are all in their pjs, and there are spinning flower umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The food was good, I ordered the \"spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles\" which came with a \"pot of bread\" which is similar to a brioche with cinnamon lining the creases. Think cinnabon without being really sweet. The steak was flavorful and tender, eggs were well seasoned and cooked just the way I ordered (over-medium).  I also stole a few bites from my sister's orders - the \"baked blueberry croissant French toast\" was pretty good. It reminded me of bread pudding slathered with super sweet blueberry compote on top, and it comes with extra compote on the side in case it isn't sweet enough for you. My sister gave up after a few bites because of its sweetness and large, overwhelming size.  As for the \"two fisted crispy chicken bagel and egg sandwich\".. it was really large and bland. Needs more seasoning. It came with half a plate of fries which were really good though!",

The servers are in jammies - which just makes you feel a tad comfortable.   The potted cinnamon bread was a little cold - if it was warm, I would think they would be amazing.   Cup of Illy coffee was ok.   I had the steak and eggs while my partner in crime had the chicken fried steak (she fancies Crack'n Barrell - but it is 2 hours away!)  The steak was ok - it was moist not dry. It was good with its side kick A1.  The chicken fried steak had a piece of hair or nylon in the breading which we made sure the waitress know, but we said its ok we just wanted to bring it to your attention. Five minutes later, the server brought her a new freshly cooked chicken fried steak as a courtesy @ no charge. Well... since she was halfway through her meal we decided to take it with us.   Overall good experience. There was a tad wait for the food, but kind of expected it in a full FOH, but we didn't mind as we were catching up on our current events. And no... that doesn't mean facebook. News!  Til next time.",

Corned beef hash n eggs were excellent!  LavAzza coffee was delicious!  The cup o bread was very tasty!  Great find here in Vegas!  We will definitely be back!  Our waitress Kim M. made our dining experience incredibly wonderful!    My only complaint is their loco moco is topped with a sweet gravy....a sweet gravy!   I asked if they could make a plain brown gravy and they wouldn't.  For this reason I didn't order.    Otherwise a great dining experience and we will return!",

Eggs cooked just the way we like them, runny yokes. Hash browns were crispy. The butter for the toast comes on the side as did the gravy for the country fried steak. Very nice touch. Staff was great. Kimberly was really nice and friendly. And I have to say that about the pasta in the frying pan.",

I didn't hold back on the carb intake this morning at all. The more the merrier.   On  to other means, service was great, price was a bIt pricey but worth it. The servers wear pajamas to work. I thought it was a joke at first. But super cool touch! It makes me want to work here.   Extra bonus Points for being a really well kept, and clean restaurant. Would return and would recommend",

Southern Highlands location - Once seated, it took close to more that 15 mins to get our water,  30 mins for the server to take our order and another hour to get our food. We've seen people get seated, eat and leave while we were seated. Totally unacceptable.  We spoke with the manager but did nothing about it.  Henderson Location - Thought I'd try this new location out. I ordered for pickup. Low and behold, I had a very long piece of hair in my food. We called and spoke with the manager and requested for a refund but we needed to go back to the location. Once at the location, the manager was no where to be found.  Got the refund from the host but WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  I DO NOT RECOMMMEND GOING TO THIS PLACE. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT DENNY'S.",

The upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling are cute and colorful.   We decided to split a Steak and Chorizo burrito and Corned Beef Hash. Our waitress was really nice, and brought waters to the table before we even placed our order.   The burrito was huge and looked amazing. We cut into it and began eating. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium-rare. The more we ate though, we did not find any chorizo. There were eggs, but no chorizo. We figured that maybe we got the wrong order, but I didn't see any other steak breakfast burrito on the menu. So that was a bummer. it was still tasty, but not what we were looking forward to having. The Corned Beef Hash was good. It was seasoned differently than any other we have had up to this point, and because of this it kind of threw us off somehow.   It was very loud in here for breakfast. The entrance is very awkward and cramped as well. Immediately inside the door there are benches on either side. There is nowhere to stand, only to sit. While paying, people are coming in and being led to their seats. I went to wait outside because I was constantly having to move out the way of incoming customers and the wait staff. Behind the register is the door that leads out to the patio. It is just a very small area, with a lot going on all at once.  Although the food was decent, the experience itself was just okay.",

    "text": "Mediocre. Decided after reading some reviews to play it safe and order bacon and eggs, so my food was just ok. My husband ordered chilaquiles. Maybe it was our fault for ordering a Mexican dish in an American breakfast joint but maybe it was just the lack of customer service skills of our waitress. When asked how he liked his eggs over the chilaquiles he said He would like them scrambled with the tortillas. She let him know there was going to be an Extra charge for it which he agreed.  When the order came. It was all wrong. There was cotija cheese scambled into the eggs and the eggs were just laying on top of the chilaquiles. When she came by again we told her that we had been charged extra for mixing the tortillas with the eggs, but the eggs were just laid on top. This is how the conversation played out afterward:  Waitress: \"there is no tortillas in chilaquiles\" Us: \"Ummm yes, yes there is, that's exactly what chilaquiles are\" Waitress: \"those are chips\" Us: \"yeah tortillas\" Waitress: \"Ok I'm confused\" Us: \"you said there would be a charge to scramble the eggs with the chilaquiles but they are just laying on top\" Waitress: \"You said you wanted Quote eye Ja mixed into the eggs\" Us: no, what's that? You asked is how we wanted the eggs. Waitress: cheese Us: You mean Cotija (Co-tee-haa) cheese? Waitress: no, quote eye ja Us: no that's not what we said. Waitress: I'm so confused, what can I do? Us: nevermind  Well first of all my family was born in Cotija so we know how it's pronounced and what it is. We are also very aware of what comes in chilaquiles and how they are prepared. Unfortunately the waitress does not.  As far as what they tasted like, they tasted like chips with store bought salsa. Definitely the worst we have ever had. Sad thing is I have actually made chilaquiles at home with store bought green salsa and they come out pretty decent....these not so much. We should have stuck with panera breakfast.",

I got notified that the biscuit and gravy had an issue with something, so I switched to a corn beef and hash. How long did it take to complete the order? TWO HOURS. TWO. It got here at 12:10pm and we were trying to cancel our order and they marked the food as being prepared already so we couldn't even get a refund.   And the food? Horrible. We waited two hours for badly prepared food? The steak was charred and it wasn't even medium rare when I asked, and it just looks like someone threw up on my corn beef. I can't believe we can't even get a refund for this crappy food.",

I ordered the carne asada chilaquiles and it was good but next time I would like for there to be more sauce on the chips. The chips were still a bit crunchy. Everything that was on the plate went well Together. I got the eggs over easy and overall a good dish just needed more sauce for the chips and then it would have been perfect. My husband and dad got the BYO omelettes and they were very pleased. The restaurant atmosphere is very nice, the employees wear pajamas and that's really cute. I would definitely go Back there again. They have a very vast Menu with alot of choices from salads to sandwiches etc.",

To be honest, we expected mediocre service because from experience when a restaurant is slow or about to close, service isn't great. We were pleasantly surprised when we received great service from EVERYONE!   The only thing they got wrong was my husband's steak temperature which they fixed right away. The server even insisted that he take a piece while he waited for the right steak!  The Pot Of Bread is a MUST TRY!!!",

They have different flower umbrellas hanging across the ceiling. Also all the waiters are wearing pajamas haha.   Our waiter, Vanessa (purple hair), was amazing. She was energetic and so helpful. We were unable to get our cup of bread because of complications but she made up for it by offering something else and taking some things off of our bill. That to me is the definition of customer service.   The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and eggs and that steak was magical. So tender and juicy. I haven't had a good steak like that in a while. I also ordered the caramel iced coffee, that was amazing as well.   All in all this place is definitely a 5 star. If you have the time to wait about 30 mins for a table then this is the place to dine at. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely make a stop here.   Quick Update 5/21/19: THIS PLACE STILL ROCKSSSS! Came twice this time while we were in town.",

We made the short drive from the strip to this local spot and was glad we did.  The place is busy and unique.  Tucked in a small strip mall it shares a parking lot with other establishments including a small casino lounge.  The wait wasn't long at all.  We were seated and ordered our food within minutes.  Our food and drink came out rather quickly.  All of the staff was dressed in pajamas, wish I knew so that I could have worn mine to be more comfortable too lol.  The decor is cool and funny.  They sell custom shirts and socks here too!    The food was excellent and the juice was fresh squeezed.   Service was excellent and prompt!  I'll probably be back again when visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "Came twice in a week. First time on fourth of July and another time Sunday morning. Both times wait was about 20-30 minutes. Although the second time they never called me and crossed my name out while I stood directly outside the door. When I came in they said someone else claimed my name?  Food is overpriced. First time I got chilaquiles which equates to dry chips with a dry seasoning on them, covered in cheese, eggs, and whatever meat you chose. Think nachos with shredded cheese. Definitely not chilaquiles which are wet and swimming in salsa. I didn't even mind that the server got my order wrong and came back with the same chips and the correct meat afterwards. Although the different proteins shouldn't be advertised with either red or green salsa if it's all interchangeable.  Second visit I got eggs benedict. Hollandaise was not from a can but absolutely curdled and for some reason, drizzled with a balsamic vinegar sauce?! Why? WHY? Eggs were totally hard poached. No breakable yolks which I suppose I should've asked for instead of expecting it. My dining companion got the loco moco. They were out of gravy and instead of comping his extra egg to make up for it, it was $2. I tried his sirloin burger, it was supposed to be medium and came out as such, but also incredibly dry. Like, it was a mistake not to have a LOT of gravy, dry. Not to mention we could taste the dirty grill all over the burger.  I hear the fresh squeezed orange juice is good but I didn't feel like paying the $5 for myself. All fixable mistakes but coupled with average to below average service too I'm unlikely to go for a third try.",

My only refeed for 6 weeks and it sucked! She wanted to replace my burrito, but I did eat it. I ate it why she asked, because I wasn't about to drive another 20 minutes to pick another burrito like this one.   The cuts of steak in burrito was not that great either. There was a lot of chewy parts on the meat that I cut and put aside not to mention the crusty burnt outside of the steak. I was better off going to Fausto's or Roberto's. This wasn't worth the drive or my business. I don't plan on coming back here anymore. The manager thought it was funny I ate the burrito and wanted my money back. I had no choice but to eat it and as funny as it sounds, I'm a body builder and competing in a few weeks and have no time to waste when feeding my muscles so she can laugh all she wants but I have pictures and videos to prove that my food was over cooked. I've ordered hash browns from them before and it wasn't like this.",

Then one of the servers got down to wipe something of the floor and at the same time in another hand was carrying food on a tray to serve it. That was discussing and they need to change that practice asap. So I don't know will I go back to that place again, its just one of those cravings I had and happened to be nearby.",

Until i waved down the waitress ,nobody seemed to acknowledge us .  After that, my husband ordered steak medium rare while i ordered medium ... they messed up our plates and we had to switch plates between us after we realized . But my mom's steak and my husband's were burnt way too much for a steak. Mine too,but i dealt with it.  All of this takes your appetite away and makes you not come back again .  I have told everybody i know about your place and how good it is . But i will take that back and recommend them to maybe try a different location !  I'm very disappointed !

Everything started off well.  Staff was friendly upon entrance, and we were seated relatively immediately.  It's a cute, welcoming interior.  The umbrellas from the ceiling and the waitstaff in pajamas were a homely touch.    Before delving into the meat (this pun will make sense later) of the review, I would like to disclaim that our server Kim was absolutely lovely.  Zero complaints.   Here we go:  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium with a kids order or dollar sized pancakes.   My mom ordered the little steak and egg breakfast, steak medium well.   My eggs needed to be sent back because the yolks came over-hard, and I sent back the steak due to it being a medium rare.    The eggs came back perfect, the steak did not.  It was like they threw the piece of meat on an overly-hot grill enough to burn the outside to pieces, leaving the interior still underdone.    My mom couldn't finish her breakfast due to the odor and temperature of the steak.  Our breakfast was spent tag teaming eating our food due to the items that needed to be redone.    Ultimately as a place that boasts the name \"steak\" in the moniker, I was misled into high expectations.  The manager was gracious enough to come over, apologize for the error, and remove the dish from the bill however even this couldn't wash out the bad taste this steak and experience left in my mouth.",

    "text": "This review is not for the food but for the manager named Amber.  My wife and I came there for breakfast on July 22.  As usual the food was great.  We both wanted iced coffee.  The waiter asked what kind of coffee; latte, etc.  I was VERY clear all we wanted was coffee poured over ice.  When I was given the bill I saw it was $8.70 for two coffees.  I questioned the waiter who said it was \"italian roast.\"  When I asked what the hot coffee was he said \"italian roast.\"  I then asked for the manager, who said she was the \"GM.\"  Amber couldn't have been less helpful.  \"This is what we charge because the coffee is in these special glasses.\"  I then asked, \"Really?  I'm paying an extra $1 each for a special glass?  Why couldn't you just put in a water glass?\"  She then told me I should have ordered hot coffee and a cup of ice.  I told her to reduce the bill by the difference between hot coffee and the same coffee poured over ice.  She kept refusing until I threatened to stiff the waiter to make up for the $2.  I then received another bill and paid.  On the way out the waiter made a somewhat nasty remark to me.  I asked Amber for the contact of the owner.  She refused for quite awhile but then gave me an email address.  I have now been waiting for about 2 weeks for a reply to my email.  After I called the other store I was told that manager would call me.  Still crickets.  As I wrote, the food is excellent.  Until Amber is fired we won't return.",

If you like oranges, ask for some orange juice. It's obviously fresh squeezed but the definitely use top quality oranges!  The hostess was a great start of our experience! Was extremely nice and pick up on me being a smart a#*  and played along great!  Deidre was who waited on us.  She was super sweet and did a great job.  We were lucky enough to watch the head chef work the server side of the kitchen. His attention to detail making sure everything was amazing.  But what really impressed me was the respectful way that he communicated with the kitchen staff if there was anything that needed to be adjusted.  We walked out of there telling people it was the best breakfast we've had in a long time!  This is our new regular breakfast place.  DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP!",

The food is affordable and is a little hefty on the servings, which means more of an excuse to take it home. I ordered the Egg Benedict and a cup of their oj. Service is alright and see all staff tending to their busy rush hour, our waitress checked up on us multiple times, and the atmosphere is relaxing for an early morning;  But with only have eating the egg Benedict as my first meal (and last meal of the day) I felt sick afterwards and knew right away that I had food poisoning; im not sure what exactly it was, but with this unpleasant experience after...it's gonna take me awhile to return to this restaurant.",

The tortilla chips are supposed to be soft, they are soaked in enchilada sauce before making, and are made with eggs, it's a mexican breakfast dish. I thought they were so good. Next, the complaint about the chicken and waffles, my friend had them & they were equally good, the breast was tender and flavorful. I've been here a couple times and had a couple different items on the menu, I have never had anything disappointing. Customer service has always been top notch. Love the French press coffee and the pot of bread & fresh jam. They also have a patio, people bring their dogs, comfy table & chairs with umbrellas.",

A man who I believe is the owner interacts with customers on a regular basis in a very friendly way.  Now, the food. Admittedly, I haven't had a huge sampling of the menu. The reason for this is that once I tried the fried chicken and waffles, there was really no reason to do much in the way of exploring. The chicken is pounded before it's fried so it fits perfectly on top of the waffle. It also has a nice peppery thing going on. Not only is it delicious but it's more \"convenient\" to eat than chicken and waffles where the chicken still has the bone in it.  Also, they have some kind of English sausages there. Those things are also awesome.",

    "text": "Some of our friends said this place was really good so we decided to give it a go; it also had good Yelp reviews and, being the Yelper I am, I try and put faith in my fellow Yelpians (is that what we're called?  I dunno).  Unfortunately, it was a little less than what I was hoping for.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was maybe half-full and it looked like most people were eating or had already finished, enjoying cups of coffee and talking amongst their parties.  We expected pretty quick, efficient service due to this, and did not receive it.  Everything was slow: ordering, getting things to our table, the check - it was really disappointing since it was obvious we missed the \"big rush.\"  The hash browns were definitely nothing to write home about and tasted starchy - I tried some of my fiance's.  And their coffee was like watery mud oil.  I ordered a signature dish because I really like to try those from places.  So, I got the blueberry and cream cheese stuffed french toast (I believe this was the name).  It came out and was HUGE!  They definitely don't skimp on portions, hence the extra star.  When I tried it, though, it was way too processed sugary.  I picked at the blueberries and the french toast for awhile but got full super fast and ended up sharing it with the rest of the table.  French toast doesn't really make good leftovers.  Pretty sure I should have gotten a heart attack from that, but the overall taste WAS decent.  Another downer was they didn't have low-fat cream cheese as an alternative, which is probably why I felt so full so fast as well.  Overall, definitely not impressed.  Perhaps everyone else just got lucky and had better food / service than I did.  Considering the above plus the prices, I'd rather just go to IHOP.",

Our group had already ordered but our waitress took our order promptly and was able to bring it out with our friends. AWESOME!  We shared the corn beef hash and scrambled eggs but shared everyone elses food too. The food was good....not amazing...not to die for....but definitively worth our drive. Everything tasted good. I particularly liked the pancakes. Yum!  Overall a great sunrise stop to fill your bellies before starting your day. Good service, good food and good prices. You should not leave unsatisfied.

My husband and kids ate there for my husbands birthday breakfast and the food was just awful .i got the eggs Benedict which used to be my favorite dish until this place singlehandedly ruined it , it was a tough English muffin and the hollandaise was super sour and had way too much lemon in it, not to mention the hash browns we're basically raw and had freezer burn taste to it , they tried to cover it up with an excessive amount of butter . My husband got the country fried steak which was just a piece of thin meat with breading and the breading was very chalky, to call it a country fried steak is giving it too much credit for whatever that mistake was . My kids however liked their food because they are 2 and 3 and giving sugar and pancakes to children is always a success . Long story short , you're over paying for shit food! NEVER AGAIN!",

Unfortunately, that is where it all the positive points end for me. I was given a napkin with a fork and knife rolled inside, which is standard for most breakfast spots. When I picked the bundle up to unroll it I SEE AN OBVIOUS SMEAR OF BLOOD ACROSS THE NAPKIN!!! I quietly alert our waitress and she says \"OHH!! OPPS!! WOW!! Let me take that.\" She brought me a new set and nothing else was said or mentioned again. No manager, shift supervisor, janitor - ZERO. Blood on a napkin served to a patron is pretty serious if I remember correctly, like a health code violation serious. I try to move on with my meal, I personally only ordered a yogurt parfait. When it arrives I notice it was made upside-down. Yes, that sounds silly and petty but when you have a slender glass making it upside-down gives you about 1 or 2 strawberries max and 3 thin slices of a banana. Then the entire thing was soaked in honey (my fault, I should have asked for that on the side.). We also ordered an egg white omelette. They didn't make it with egg whites. The pancakes were overly sweet, like they added something to the batter. BUT... The juices and little cinnamon rolls were delicious. Sadly, the negatives FAR outweighed the positives in this experience. Bummer.",

We had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately the menu serves up cheap ingredients to its patrons (for the exception of the Illy coffee) and the cooks fall short on preparing food properly.    At a price point of $10-$15 for breakfast, they should know how to cook eggs properly.  Nothing irritates us more than when a cook makes two cheap/small eggs (over medium)  together on an extremely high heat using a bright yellow colored fat  (margarine?).  The plate was loaded with what appeared to be nasty refined margarine or oil.  I soaked up two napkins full of this nasty stuff.  We were delivered two rounds of this type of cooking and just gave up.  The hash browns that we ordered as golden (as opposed to raw in oil) were flash fried.  Disgusting and half hearted presentation.  Seriously, Robert Irvine would have hit the roof if he was ever served this food.    We also ordered  pancakes that were loaded with artificial vanilla extract.  I've tasted better frozen pancakes than the chemical cakes cakes served at this restaurant. Sorry but it's True. Very disappointing.  If money is no object and you don't care about what's in the food that you put into your body, this is your place.  If you really want to have a top shelf breakfast with amazing ingredients, visit EAT downtown.  It is so worth the drive and your body will thank you for it.",

Food: Cinnamon french toast was perfectly crisped, sweet, & fresh. Steak Chilaquiles got high marks from our group as well.  Meh: Toast in a cup: though you'd think otherwise.",

    "text": "Ex and I went Dicing 2 Eat (Dice Living).     I chose the restaurant because I had heard that they wear their Pajamas when serving and it sounded neat.    I was right!    They do and it is neat!  Once there we were seated in the nearest booth to the door because I walk on a cane from a broken ankle I sustained in December, no fun!    but that was very nice of the waitress to do for me.  The restaurant was clean and surprisingly empty-very few people were there and i had heard to come early and be prepared to stand in line so that made me wonder....  I had to try an item off the menu from a section chosen by The Die.   ~The Classics done better~ was chosen for me and then my Ex Don got to choose an item for me to try from that section (want to go Dicing with us yet?    we need a 3rd  :D )    Chilaquiles was chosen for me (that may be the incorrect spelling though)   It was basically fried Tortilla chips covered with Refried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, avocado and topped with 2 eggs.   YUM!!      I chose the section for my partner and I chose beverages and then I was to choose his item and chose a Mocha Iced Coffee.   He did not like it, he said it was watery and weak, I decided to order the Vanilla Mocha and had the same results and we love Iced coffee, Ihop seems to make the best from what we have had so far and this is the ONLY reason I have to give this place a 4 instead of a 5 star review.  The service was excellent and because I told the waitress that we were new, she brought me a Pot O Bread for Free, its a cinnamon roll in a cup served with a kind of sweet and not sweet dipping sauce-It was excellent.  Highly recommend this place!       They even have spinning umbrella lamps!       We will be going back next time The Dice chooses it of course!",

We came early enough, so there was no large crowd. We were greeted by our server Krys who was nice enough to go over the menu with us and she recommended the Country fried steak and the Red Velvet pancakes. First off, the pancakes were so good. Light and super savory. It was like eating cake. Cake that had an awesome cream cheese syrup!   Krys also mentioned that the Country Fried Steak was life changing, she was right! The Country Fried Steak is the best I've ever had hands down! I'm a big fan of Cracker Barrel and Rise and Shine just blew it out of the water! The steak was so tender with a light coat of breading that has a hint of spice. My wife had order envy and vowed to get it next time. Next time may be coming up very soon! Excellent breakfast spot in Southern Highlands that has a nice warming atmosphere with a great staff that truly love being there. Highly recommended!",

We always get the same thing, country fried steak, the Texas French toast and a side of bacon. Slowly the service and \"friendly\" atmosphere turned to crabby and sloppy. I understand that breakfast places are usually packed on the weekends but that is no excuse for the lack of customer service. When I say \"thank you\" as you put down my food I don't expect a lot but maybe a \"you're welcome\". Last week we went to the newer location on Valle Verde and because the food has always been Phenomenal we will take the drive and go to that one. We will miss our regular servers but the new staff that has been hired needs to be trained in basic manners at the Southern Highlands location.",

As we got seated we were greeted by a nice sever who gave us as much time as we needed and since it was our first time there I have to admit we took about 15-20 minutes before deciding what we wanted. I ordered the Ultimate Steak and Eggs w/ the \"bread-o-cup.\" After waiting for about 15-20 minutes our food came out and their portioning was big! My favorite part was the bread-o-cup, it's a bread with cinnamon and they give you a side of glaze to dip your bread. The total for my plate alone was $18 including tax. Our server was amazing she always checked up on us and always had a positive attitude, she recommended the bread-o-cup to me and she was excited for me to try it. Also, their employee's here wear pajamas, it's so cute! This breakfast restaurant's work attire is so unique and creative, the environment is filled with families and happy morning people in my opinion haha. I recommend you come in to this place right when they open or between 7am and 9am because anytime after that they have a long wait. When we were done eating there were people waiting inside to be seated as well as groups outside to be seated. This is a great breakfast spot.",

We went around 9:40am and waited twenty minutes for a table.   I came for steak and eggs so that is what I ordered. They have a little spin to it. They put steak and poached egg on a bagel like an eggs Benedict. This was creative and so delicious. It was called NY steak, spinach and Benedict bagel. This also comes with a pot of bread that everyone on yelp was raving about. Unfortunately, they were already out of this pot of bread so they gave a choice of bread for toast instead. I still would like to see what this pot of bread tastes like. :(   My sister got the red velvet pancakes. She stated that they were really rich.   Another one of my sisters got the Fancy Steakhouse Omelet. She claims this was delicious.   One more of my other sisters got the Three Little Pigs Two Fisted Bagel and Egg Sandwich. She said it was good but she didn't enjoy the sausage.   Lastly, service here was excellent. I didn't catch our servers name but she was really friendly and she seemed to really enjoy her time. All the servers wear pajamas. Maybe it's due to the comfort of the uniform or the people she works with, but either way, she seemed to have gotten up on the right side of the bed. :)",

Yesterday they really showed their 5+ star service.  My family had our reunion this weekend and we had trouble finding a place that could accommodate our large party.   At last minute i thought of Rise & Shine and Liam the manager was able to book us @ 9:30am (busiest time on Sunday morning) As we filtered in more and more of my family showed that we hadn't expected. never did it throw them off.  We were a total of 52 people.  Our server Vanessa and the rest of the staff rocked it.   There was a couple of missed orders but to be expected.  Overall all 52 people enjoyed and were happy (hard feat to accomplish) Wanted to give the last shout out to the gal that passsed tickets out and made paying easy (sorry didn't catch your name).   Thank you again for such awesome service and ending our reunion with delicious food.",

I am basically in a food coma while writing this review. I generally don't eat this much, but i traveled quite a bit just to check out the place so i said what the heck. It was worth the drive.

Once there you're greeted by servers in PJs. The stay open only until 3 so go early. I had the chilaquiles and rib eye. Amazingly good and affordable.",

I called the restaurant to let them know and the female who answered told me what I saw online wasn't correct. When I let her know they should probably fix that she stated they don't even have prices online. Umm??? Sorry. Not lying, lady. When I pay as much as we did and we overpay and get shorted on the items I expect better customer service. The short stack platter online should come with 4 hotcakes and 2 eggs and bacon. I got 2 cakes and 1 egg and barely cooked bacon. The fullstack online comes with 5 hotcakes for $0.70 more. If they've changed their menu fine. What about that other egg? Why are the pancakes in various sizes and falling apart?Sorry you were busy but if you guys can't provide quality every time why put anything out? So upset we paid so much for what we got.",

The staff is friendly and definitely acknowledges youe presence. Some of the waiters and waitresses wears pajamas to stick with the rise and shine theme.   The decor of the place is very appealing as well. They used umbrellas as lamp covers hanging from the ceiling. They also have mosaic art along the walls, making this place very comfortable and homey. They also have an open kitchen, where you can actually see them cooking and preparing meals.  I did not get steak and eggs but I did get the a classic egg, sausage, hash brown platter. Everything was well done, the sausage was juicy. The eggs were perfectly over easy, and the hash browns were crispy and moist in the inside.   They have a pretty intensive menu full of good food with reasonable pricing! I will definitely come back here again.  Great job Rise & Shine and staff!",

It was just a little hot because it's 100 degrees outside and we were sitting on the window table, and drinking strong hot coffee with my fav French vanilla creamer.   I ordered the ham n eggs Benedict with spinach. Delicious! Hollandaise sauce was on point, better than most other breakfast places and it's also drizzled with balsamic. ;) The BF ordered the roasted turkey, bacon, egg, Swiss, tomato on an \"everything\" bagel. Wow is all I have to say!!! Super huge with lots of cheese and delicious. We will definitely be here on the regular!!",

We waited for our beverages for more than fifteen minutes. While waiting, we start seeing other parties being seated. They were getting drinks... Where the hell was ours? We couldn't even find our server and we were getting agitated and hungry.   Finally, our server comes out of the woodwork and gives us our beverages. We gave our order and that too, took forever and a day! They were out of peanut butter and blueberry French toast that we ordered, but didn't tell us until ten minutes later. While waiting, we watch getting more and more pissed with every person on the same row as us get their food while we did not - and we arrived before ALL of them!   Our server was not attentive, never apologized, and we just felt like they could of cared less if we got up and left. After feeling like we've been there for thirty minutes, we finally get our food. I shared the corn beef hash with my sister. It was ok - I've had better corn beef hash elsewhere. The only reason I give this place two stars instead of one was their Belgian waffle. It was pretty yummy.",

I politely wait but the cashier was trying to save all the papers from flying(the workers would open the side door and the receipts would fly everywhere) then 3 people get in line and the manger tell me to go behind them. But I got there before them?!! That's not fair. I pay and the cashier says have a nice day. I tell him, \"where's my food?\" I loved waiting 20 extra minutes to get my foodlol...just kidding. Oh and you should see the $2.50 I got charged for a side of strawberries. If you don't believe me, look at the picture I posted on yelp. The service gets worse every time I come.  Not coming back.",

It seems that they are expanding as well, but a better table management system would be beneficial for this business. Using a marker and paper to manage tables is not effective. It's 2015!

Came in on a Monday morning and the place was pretty empty (to be expected for a weekday).  We sat at the counter.  I had some questions to make a veg or vegan breakfast, and the waitress was not helpful in the least. Okay, I get it, the name may say it all..but you can be helpful ...right??? Wrong.  I asked about the breakfast potatoes being cooked in oil or butter and she said it was butter... imitation butter. Wow, a place that charges $10-$15 per plate and you're serving fake butter? Regardless I wanted my potatoes cooked in oil. It was a no go. So I ordered a juice... sucked it down...and will not return.",

The wait was a short 10 min followed by overly cheerful pajama wearing ladies that would be a colorful start to any day. It was for us.   Sat down and was immediately greeted by our bubbly waitress and my husband and I knew from the menu description that we wanted to share an omelette and picked the FANCY Steakhouse Omelette packed with juicy steak, mushrooms, onion, cheese, spinach and bearnaise. Can we just say ABSOLUTELY YUM!!  Besides the pot of bread (extra yum) and the potatoes filled with onions (that were perfect)...Rise and Shine is the place to be. They do serve breakfast as well as lunch. Simply Wonderful!",

Unheard of, and I've seen a lot of chicken fried steak. Perfectly done, with just the right spice in the accompanying gravy, which came in two side porcelain cups. I'm happy with my fried steak covered & smothered but it made my wife and son happy as they are not into their food touching, and the serving size definitely is share-worthy. The bacon: perfectly finished, with a unique, slightly smoky flavor, and a side is 4 pieces, not 2 or 3. Cinnamon French toast: one of about 8 carb-centric breakfast options, each of which sounded incredible, but again, better than described or expected. My wife's favorite part was friendly Christine whose bright and positive attitude left us with all feeling happier about the day.  We will make a point to return!",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of breakfast food, I wish that I could say I loved this place and that I'm excited to go back, especially since it's locally owned. But, unfortunately that isn't the case.   he service was great. We were greeted right away and seated. Soon after someone took our drink orders [they serve illy coffee!]. Soon after, our waitress came up to see if we had any questions.   I'm on a mission to find the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas, so it was an easy choice when I saw it on their menu. I'll admit, once the food came out and I saw my order, I wanted to drool a little bit. It was a nice big portion of the chicken, scrambled eggs, gravy, & hash browns.   The eggs were cooked well enough, but lacked any taste whatsoever. A little salt would've gone a long way. The hash browns seemed a little undercooked. Potato was still kind of starchy, and they were missing that nice golden brown color on top. The gravy was actually quite good, and was probably the highlight of the dish. Moving on to the main item, the steak. I liked the fact that it was a thick steak with a thin batter on it. Unlike the eggs, it did not lack in flavor whatsoever. Unfortunately, the ONLY flavor it had was of black pepper. Apparently what they lacked in salt in the eggs, they made up for with an excessive amount of black pepper on the coating of the steak and on the steak.   One of my fellow diners ordered the chicken & waffles. His chicken had the same exact problem as my steak. All we could taste was the black pepper. It's unfortunate really, because both the chicken and steak were tender and cooked well.   The pot of bread that came with my order was sub-par. Like the eggs, it lacked taste. I don't usually like to but butter on my rolls, but this bread definitely needed it to get some flavor.   So, all in all - great service but lacked a bit in the food department. The food was cooked well, but needed better execution in my opinion. Hopefully, I just went on an off day. Maybe next time, if I so happen to be on that side of town during breakfast hours I might give it another chance. But it's definitely not worth another 20 minute drive for the sole purpose of eating there.",

We asked to be moved and were reseated in a nice booth within 5 minutes. Crisis averted.  Good coffee.  We just got the plain ole, plain ole instead of the french press, and it was good.  I decided, since the name says \"a steak and egg place,\" I should probably order steak and eggs.  So, I ordered the \"ultimate,\" a ribeye (my fave cut), 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough. $12.95.  The steak was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned.   The hashbrowns were good.  A nice rustic style different from your average frozen shredded hashbrown.  Eggs were cooked perfect as well, just needed salt and pepper.  Easy to add. No complaints.  My gal pal ordered the steak and chilaquiles.  They were very tasty, and quite a portion! I cleverly coerced her into ordering the cinnamon bread so we could share.  It was good.  However; not sweet like I had anticipated.    The restaurant is super cute.  Decor is charming.  Menu is cluttered and overwhelming.  The service was excellent.  Offered to refill our coffee 3-4 times, allowed us planty of time to chat.  Didn't rush us.  We had a lovely breakfast and I would go back anytime!  I would give it five stars if they had additional offerings such as lattes, cappucinos, bloody mary's and mimosas.  Necessary breakfast beverages in my book.  $33 for two coffees and 2two breakfasts.  $19 each with tip.",

    "text": "The management is the best advertisement because he is friendly, humorous, and attentive. Another place were listening to someone speak about food with excitement. I love a place that does that, then genuinely seeks out customers opinion. I admire when people refuse to allow themselves to become complacent with a good menu. Besides the gentleman that greeted and seated us, the rest of the staff were also pleasant.   Today was my birthday and it was a fitting place to celebrate. Although most of the festivities will be tomorrow, this relaxing brunch made my day. When I think of festive eats, I go all out. I had ordered the chicken and waffle. When I first cut into the waffle, I was a bit disappointed. It lacked the crunch that I normally love, but after thinking it over, I can understand why they lean towards this style. The chicken is moist, crispy and seasoned to perfection. Having a more cake like waffle gives contrast in texture and soaks up the maple syrup better. You will be dousing your dish in this warm condiment. It is outstanding. The maple syrup alone deserves five stars. The steak and eggs are also delectable. The 8oz cut is marbled well with just enough fat to keep the meat moist and tender. The eggs have a clean flavor that does not need any salt. The potatoes were soft like mashed potatoes on the inside, but had a crunchy outer layer that was nice. Nothing on this plate needed ketchup or steak sauce. We ordered the pot of bread with this meal and it was gone just as soon as it hit the table. The jam was filled with huge chunks of strawberries, but was quite sweet.  Rise and Shine would be perfect if only it offered some lighter fares. On special occasions, like today, I am willing to go crazy on my caloric intake.  Yet a part of my subconscious will not let this go without guilt. I am not even Catholic, so what's with this overbearing feeling? It might be some time before I visit again.",

So I Yelped a spot and was instantly intrigued by Rise and Shine. It was the location-not far from where I live- and those darn cute flower umbrellas that they have hanging from their ceiling. It was busy but with a ten minute wait on a Sunday Morning I'm not complaining....The flower umbrellas were so cute and everytime the door opened the air spinned some of them around-Whimsical I tell ya!!! Anyways, I did also enjoy all the mosaics on the walls as well-Artsie!!!  The food= An option for bread is a cinnamon bread baked in a flower pot with a knife stabbed in the top served with butter and strawberry jam. Let me tell ya one is not enough- It was so good but I wish those flower pots were fatter for more darn warm yummy bread. Cute idea though... I loved reading that the Chicken in the Chicken and Waffles was a chicken breast-YAY!!!!!! So I picked that and it was really good. The breading was pretty tasty and spicy as well and the chicken breast was pounded flat so you got a pretty big piece. My daughter got a short stack of pancakes-So fluffy and good too...Now on to the grumpy BF who already was having attitude-He got eggs,hash browns and bacon-He was not impressed and hated his bacon-Oh well, so sad....I tried his food and it was fine he is just too particular about his bacon but like I told him thats why you have a voice use it and request what you like!!! I will be back and the BF can wait in the car....",

It was a pretty tender piece of steak. But if the steak is the main part of the meal, the cooks need to be more attentive to that. Selling point is the steak. Not the hash browns, biscuits, eggs, etc.... service wasn't too bad either. Although they could've done a bit more than walk away after I let them know about the steak.",

I ordered the country fried steak it was pretty good with the gravy on the side. Only downside it was breaded a little too much to my liking. I also tried a side of the red velvet pancakes to compare with the ones at BabyStacks Cafe. I'm sorry it just doesn't cut it. These pancakes did not even look RED, it looked more like a burned pancake. It was also too chocolatey inside. The cream cheese syrup was too thick and too sweet. I guess I'll have to go to BabyStacks for my red velvet fix. Other than that I enjoyed my main dish. I also ordered the steak chilaquiles for my boyfriend togo and that looked delicious. He enjoyed it! I would like to come back and try their other breakfast items.",

Anways, the food was hit or miss, mostly hit.  My eggs and potatoes were great, seasoned well, fresh and not greasy.  The chicken fried steak was gnarly, however.  They've got their fryer turned up to high.  It was greasy and overcooked and the breading looked like dogfood.  Overall this place is a 3.5.

I got the biscuits and gravy which were good but not the best I've ever had. We also got a stack of the red velvet pancakes. Now those were great especially with the cream cheese icing. The service however was very subpar. We only got our drinks refilled one time as we were leaving and our plates had already been cleared away.

    "text": "WTF. Seriously. This is the fourth time I've come here. And only ONE time was I treated nicely and fairly. Hence this review. Hoping a MANAGER OR OWNER MIGHT SEE IT!!! I'll just discuss today's debacle.  It started off great. No wait!! Even got a booth!! Waitress shows up... looking annoyed, disinterested in general. I felt like my entire visit went downhill from here....  I asked her for a large OJ... and I get a CARAFE.... is that large? Um. Ok. I asked for for a 1/2 order of French toast... which I got, yet... they were \"less fluffy\" and basically looked like I got the welfare white bread version instead of the Texas toast version. My 12 year old daughter asked for chocolate chip pancakes and eggs/bacon....this is where it gets \"interesting\". She's 12... not 15 or 20... ya think the waitress bothered to ask me 1 question? Or tell me sizes or maybe whether we want the adult or child or just completely ala carte? Nope not a word. (Let's \"pad the check\"...huh). So when she brought out my 12 year olds breakfast... you might has well thought she's a LUMBERJACK!!! Because that's what the waitress ordered for her. 4 supercalifragilistic ginormous god damn pancakes. And a small side of some crappy tiny eggs and burnt bacon. I sat there dumbfounded. When she finally came back around, I had already finished my \"French toast\" and asked her what this was... POINTING to my daughters meal. I asked her why she didn't tell us it was for a lumberjack. Why didn't she steer us to something more HER SIZE?? Basically she was speechless... then with an attitude she said \"I can take off 2 pancakes\"... but the look on her face was right out of the movie \"waiting\"... (ummm... ya know...yikes... like I'll take the food back and spit on it.) So I declined. Of course my daughter didn't finish the Paul Bunyan meal. So we go to leave to pay the check. She rushes up to hand me the check and says nothing. The cashier asks me how everything was. I complained. Did anyone get a manager. Did the cashier apologize or offer any assistance. NO. NO. NO. NADA. NYET. NOTHING. It's not like I'm looking for a free meal. I paid the whole $35 god damn dollars for a senior size French toast, a lumberjack meal and 1 \"large\" OJ. $35 dollars. THIRTY-FIVE FRICKING DOLLARS FOR BREAKFAST. Way to pad the check. I am so aggravated at the bullshit. At the LACK of assistance and LACK of service, as well as the LACK of common decency. Yeah I said that. Because who in their right mind gives a child a big ass ala carte sized meal. That's completely ridiculous. And I even gave that jerk waitress a tip. I do plan on calling and \"trying\" to speak to a manager or owner. I just don't know if they will have the same attitude as their employees. Ugh.",

I get there after the time they tell me and they told me another ten minutes, another ten minutes goes by I noticed I've been sitting for 30 minutes. So I waited about an hour for my food, when asked when my food was coming they said another 5 mins and that everything has been done and they were just waiting on one more thing. So that meant my other items have been just sitting there while waiting for one more item. I live literally 4 mins away from this place so when I get home my food shouldn't be this cold. The only thing that was fresh was the one item I was waiting on. Everything else was soggy, dry, and unpleasant. I've had the corned beef hash before but today the corn beef hash tasted like it was sitting out too long, it tasted very old. Very very very disappointed.",

Unfortunately, I have recently had to start eating gluten free and when I went to Rise & Shine yesterday I was super disappointed to learn that the chips they use in the chilaquiles are not gluten free! This would be a very easy fix for them. And as they do not have anything else gluten free friendly if you want a \"bread product\" with your meal it would expand their menu a bit. Also, the beans they use are not vegetarian (they have lard in them) another easy fix but not something I would complain about alone, I could just leave them off, but since I can't even eat the chips....   I will update my rating if they ever decide to update their menu with chips that are gluten free!",

    "text": "What happened?? I've been here about 3 or 4 times in the past and it was my favorite breakfast place. My last visit made me realize that I am no longer a fan.   My favorite breakfast dishes of all time would have to be chicken n' waffles and corn beef n' hash with eggs. And by far the best place I've had them was at Bouchon inside the Venetian. I know I can't compare a local place like this to an upscale fancy casino spot. However, I've had those two dishes at other places that were by no means fancy and it was still delicious. So I know I'm not being picky. But I was truly disappointed with what I was served on my last visit.   The corn beef n' hash I ordered was a total disappointment. First I ordered the eggs medium. When my food arrived, they weren't yolky at all. It was cooked completely through. The hash was complete mush and the corn beef was sparse. I hate wasting food, so I ate as much as I could, but I still left some on my plate. The cinnamon bread they serve in the pot was my fave.   My bf ordered the chicken n' waffles. This was a lot better than my dish. The chicken was crisp and the waffle warm. The chicken was a bit on the dry side so I just smothered it with syrup even more. I love that the syrup is served warm with a cinnamon stick inside the bottle.   My bf is a huge coffee drinker during breakfast. He will probably go through 3-5 cups. He said that the coffee tasted like the coffee you get at a hospital, so when he only had about 1.5 cups, I knew there was something off.   3 stars for being seated quickly, our super friendly waitress Shannon and the cute decor. I was really excited to bring the bf to a new breakfast spot, but I'm sad to say that I will not be returning. I will miss the pot of bread though.",

Most of the employees looked happy and comfortable in their pj's. Which is a great concept accept when you can see lint balls on the fabric.  Not very visually appealing.   So, 3 of us ordered some kind of steak and asked for it to be cooked either medium or medium-rare. They all came out well. For a place that is advertised as a \"steak and eggs\" restaurant one would think they can cook steaks correctly.    My friend did say this place is a \"hit or miss\" place.  Today was a miss.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place since our family live close by but it was always so packed that we did not get to try it until today. We wanted to see what the fuss is all about.   If you go here on the weekends, expect a longer wait time. We waited for a table for around 45 minutes even though we were advised that it will only be a 20-minute wait. When we were finally seated, we were attended to right away. I liked the motif of the interior especially the spinning umbrellas on the ceilings. Our food came out right away, which was great. I ordered the corned beef hash - a classic, how can you mess that up. The flavor is better than most breakfast places that I have tried but I do not like the texture. It was chopped ham with onions and mashed potatoes (supposedly hash brown). It was a little disappointing. Everything else that we ordered were meh. Nothing really stands out. The waffle was too doughy. The orange juice tasted like it was not freshly juiced and it was a little sweet like it was mixed with concentrate (this is just my guess).   I would still recommend this place. I might come back and give it a second opinion, maybe try their steak and eggs or their pancakes. I think since Rise and Shine is really the ONLY breakfast place in the area (I mean you can get breakfast food at The Lodge except it's a bar), a lot of people would be willing to wait for a table here. I personally think it was not worth the wait. They need to open more breakfast places in this side of town.",

I said fine, however they are still required to put it on the plate even though I requested that i did not want the those items understanding that I still was going to have to pay for it.    Yes the food portions are large, but who needs to eat that much for breakfast.   How about reducing your food portions, and lowering the prices for the healthy minded consumers.    Only bright spot was that the service was great.",

We were in Vegas for a convention and needed breakfast before driving back to California.   The wait staff are really nice and efficient. The place is clean and decorated very colorfully.   They serve Lavazza coffee, which is my favorite! You can even get a French press of coffee if you so desire.   They have a \"Pot of bread\" which is a dinner roll mixed with cinnamon and sugar baked in a small pot. Not too sweet and quite delicious.   The portions of everything that I've seen come out are quite large. No way you can leave hungry. More likely you'll want to share.   They have non GMO organic hot sauce on the table, not sure if anything else on the menu is.   I had steak and eggs and it was very yummy. The steak tasted grilled, not chewy or anything. The eggs were perfectly cooked. I like my hash browns crispy and these were not but the were still good.   My husband had corned beef hash and really liked his too. Overall a great experience!",

    "text": "I was on my way out of town and I wanted that last great meal before I was subjected yet again to horrors of the menu my trainer has had us on for the past 2 months.  This spot is tucked away in a residential neighborhood and if it wasn't for Yelp, I would have missed this breakfast gem.  By the looks of it, it's a locals favorite and a great family restaurant.   While I waited 20 minutes I reviewed the menu via this wonderful app. The consistent review was the Chilaquiles (Chi-la-key-less) for those non latin tongues. Equally for those who know what traditional Chilaquiles should taste like, these are not it. Although don't discount this dish out. This version is more of a Tex-Mex spin but it's worthy of my taste buds.  Before I started the meal I ordered a good ol' cup of Joe served generously in a large mug fit for the most caffeine frenzied freak. Trust me avoid all offers of carb delights and only order the pot of bread.  This simple but yet inventive cinnamon roll served in a juxtaposed mug of coffee is a must have. Paired with a cup of coffee it reminds you why you woke up this morning... to enjoy life with a slice of sunshine.  Just with this simple start, this establishment lives up to its glorious name.   Onto the main dish, spiced rubbed ribeye steak chilaquiles. I thought it was served with strips of steak. Oh no my friend, you get a grade cut of steak worthy of any red blooded carnivore. The Chilaquiles are more chips that True tortillas, again more of a Tex-Mex flair. They are layered with refried beans at the base, then layers of cheddar cheese, chips, topped with sour cream, pico de gallo and avocado. With a sprinkle of cotija cheese on it and you are in breakfast heaven.   The steak was phenomenal and I would gladly have a steak here over Gordon Ramsey's \"Steak\" located in Paris Hotel.  The steak is a fraction of the cost but more importantly it's better tasting. Granted it's not American Kobe beef but it doesn't have to be. The rib eye was seasoned to perfection.   This is not a light hearted breakfast and if you are like me, you won't have a need to have lunch.  The high ratings is not all hype and is definitely worth checking out. This joint has a cool and laid back atmosphere great for the family. If you want you day to start with a slice of sunshine make sure it starts here.",

    "text": "Stopped here with the family yesterday and the food was pretty good until I got a hair in my pancakes. I told them I didn't want them any more and just ate part of my wife's food since I wouldn't be able to eat pancakes thinking about the hair after that. They took the pancakes off the bill but charged $4 for the sides. Seriously, you ruin my meal and the whole family's experience and then you don't even take my personal meal off the bill? Good food, weak customer service. If they had been reasonable I might be back but that's just too little to resolve a problem, especially when breakfast is $15 bucks a plate. Everyone knows you can get a hair anywhere but anyone who works in or owns a restaurant knows you can't charge for the plate that had the hair in it. I didn't expect anyone else's meal discounted but the one with the hair should have been taken off. Get real.  It seems they responded that sides weren't included in the price unless you made the meal a platter...which I did so their point is moot.",

There were at least 20 or more people waiting to be seated while I waited for my to go order. With at least 5-6 tables & a small breakfast bar to sit at open & cleaned. All of the waitresses were dressed in pajamas, & stayed attentive to their tables. Everyone was very polite including the waiting customers. Who all seemed to be accustomed to waiting 20-30 minutes for a table for breakfast. I ordered 2 custom omelets with a side of pancakes & turkey sausage. The turkey sausage was forgotten. But they were way to busy to go back or call. As the phone was ringing off the hook while I was waiting & the line stayed busy when I called from home.  If you don't mind the wait it's a great breakfast place. If you want a little peace I suggest Denny's.",

The least expensive thing you'll find is the burger that is about $8 or $9. The rest, is $10 and up.  I think I speak for Bun and I, the hash browns were amazing. Thinly sliced potatoes with just the right amount of taste to it. The pot of bread, nomz, cinnamon bread rolled up into a cup -- it's popular and around 1pm, they were also gone!  However, the food, it was meh. And combined paying about $30 for just a brunch, we'll be back but not too frequently. My chicken fried steak, I've had better and would say Egg Works makes it more nomz.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area but wouldn't be worth going out of your way for.",

The decor is cute, slightly weird, but cute.  The servers wear pajamas and it took me a minute to realize it!  As for food, it's pretty underwhelming.  It's not terrible, but I was not impressed- no bold flavors.  The \"bread in a pot\" was bland and the chicken and waffles were pretty bland, too.  I won't ever be returning because I like a little more excitement when eating carbs and other foods in general.    There are so many better breakfast places in Las Vegas, skip this one!",

Some of the notable things I've had here include:   - Chicken Fried Steak (Thick and delicious gravy.  Steak might be a little too thickly battered.  Feel a little guilty eating it =)  Tasty hash browns on the side)  - Two Egg Breakfast (Think grand slam, but much tastier!  Not crazy about the kielbasa, so I'll stick with the sausage or bacon next time)  - Corned Beef Hash (Not like the smushy corned beef - its \"real\"!)  - Southwest Turkey Panini (Panini's here seem like a good option for lunch!)  - And always get their cute little pot of bread! (A light and fluffy Cinnamon roll - Yum!)   Like everyone else says, the service here is good.  Always kind with a smile.  I wouldn't say the food is OMG, but its solid.

    "text": "I want to emphasize something, dear eateries--cuteness doesn't make up for okay food.  I wanted to like this place a lot, not just for the cow and egg canvas on the wall or the spinning and standstill flower lights overhead.  I wanted to like this place for the simple fact that local eateries should be supported and loved dearly.  Although I love my local places, this one just fell a bit short on taste and overwhelmed me with portion size.    When you walk in to this place, it's like walking in to a freaky garden turned upside down.  I almost felt like I walked in to the Bug's Life section of California Adventure with the oversizes flowers above my head.  It's cute, though, and has plenty of seating.  The servers are friendly, but they aren't as attentive as they should be.  Although checking on us regularly, when we did want to hail one down it took about three minutes.  My mother and I, after going through the sections of the menu--sandwiches, paninis, waffles, pancakes, specials, omelets, steak, etc.--We landed on two dishes that we felt were different-chilaquiles with salsa avocado and chicken with waffles.  We were excited and couldn't wait for the food to come over.  Thinking it was a regular portion size we even ordered a side of hash browns and bacon.  When the food arrived, however, it was unexpected.  The chilaquiles was actually nachos with eggs on top and half an avocado sliced on top.  IT wasn't that pleasant, although at first it seemed to taste okay.  The chips were soggy and were simply covered in salsa and cheese.  I couldn't see where the chilaquiles part came in at all, to be honest.  The after taste was strong.  The chicken was a breast beat out to what I believe was a chicken fried steak-like thing on top of waffles.  The problem with putting a UFO disc of boneless chicken breast on top of a soft waffle is the oil went in to the waffle a bit, but the heat between the two created condensation that made the waffle soggy.  The chicken was well seasoned, a bit too spicy for just fried chicken, but moist.  The portions, however, were enough to feed 6 people between the two dishes alone.  Still, it was okay.  I do have to emphasize that fried chicken and waffles should be the classic fried chicken pieces with a waffle, but that's just me.  The hash browns weren't pleasant at all to me.  We did order it to have a crispy outside, and I assumed it would be either home fries type of hasbrowns or the typical shredded potato one.  It was..well..like a baked potato was roughly scooped out then patted in to a pancake like hashbrown thing.  They didn't season it either.  I gave it to my husband in a take away box with the leftovers so as not to waste it.  The bacon was nice, though.  Overall, it was okay, and the restaurant is interesting, but I think that there are a few tweaks they need to make.  Then again, I'm one palette against a full restaurant, so maybe I need to try something different next time.  I do like them, and I hope that my next experience in six months will be a more tasty one.  Still, you should try this place for yourself.  In the end, I feel that a cute eatery cannot cover the the fact that it's oversized, just eh food.",

    "text": "I have some odd, unexplained affinity for brunch. Something about eating eggs yet not having to wake so early for them gets me excited. As much as I love brunch, my brother outshines me in this respect tenfold. Every time I leave the house for it or come home from it, he seems to always criticize my choice in restaurant - usually exclaiming \"What about Rise & Shine? They're so much better\". Well David S., I finally tried them, and jesus! Why didn't I listen to you before?  A coworker and I decided to catch up over some brunch (she, too, shares my love for breakfast foods at normal people hours). After wavering in between this place and another establishment, we finally just took my brother's advice. The service was a bit slow at first, but was amazing once it picked up. Our waitress, Nicole (I believe that's her name) was so sweet and very attentive. Usually, I always gulp four glasses of water prior to the start of any meal. She was on top of her game - making conversation and filling our waters promptly.  To the food, we had both ordered the Baked Blueberry Croissant French Toast. When it came out, I think we were both about to die. This dish is not for the faint of heart or those struck with blueberry indifference. Literally, the dish was unrecognizable underneath the mound of blueberries. What croissant are you talking about? If that wasn't enough, there's a ramekin of the same blueberry sauce on the side! Jesus. One bite in, and I was in love. The blueberry sauce, candied walnuts, and croissant were euphoric. Not overtly sweet, just tart enough, with the perfect crunch and nuttiness of the walnuts. The portion is perfect for the price. I ended up taking half of it home in order to both save my waistline and taunt my brother by affecting his.  We had meandered a bit afterwards, inflicted with the pains of a food coma. Multiple people, other than our waitress, had stopped by for lively banter and to check up on the meal. Management was positively delightful - so genuinely sweet without any schmooze.   Weeks later, I still feel somewhat guilty. Indulgence at its best is definitely what you'll find here. Unfortunately for me, the only occasion I can bring myself to come back here for will be my birthday - my waistline will thank me.",

I just ate here this morning and it is still as great as ever! Plus, I think they extended the hours. They're open until 3pm now. The waitresses are cool. I ordered an egg-white omelet with tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and swiss cheese. It was PERFECT! It also came with hash browns and toast. I ordered it like that, but there's loads of other choices as well. The portion was just right. I adore the spinning flower umbrellas on the ceiling, too. If you sit at the barstools you can watch them make the food. It all looked so amazing. The place is really clean and there's lots of light. If you want to see some pictures or their menu check out their website and Facebook. Definitely go here!!!",

I had breakfast 3 days in a row here and enjoyed it each time.   Day 1 eggs Benedict with ham, day 2 banana foster pancakes and day 3 was bacon, eggs and a waffle!   They provide Large portions of quality food for a reasonable price.   I just moved into the area and there are not many local choices nearby but thankfully rise and shine has the fire!

    "text": "One of my go to places for breakfast spots because we live right down the street for it. Always a wait when you come so you know it's going to be good. Takes about 5 mins to be seated if not less and they make sure to get you started right away. The staff is in pjs and it's really cute.  Started off with their coffee and some pot of bread which is what they are known for. So good. For my meal I had one of their bagel sandwiches and it had egg cheese and sausage, can't complain it was good! My sister had a parfait, once again yummy. My boyfriend had the steak huevos rancheros and it looked amazing!  They are really speedy with their service and it's also really good food. Every time I get something different and I have no problems. Greta restaurant great food.",

Service was friendly like a family diner. This is the place to go for a large breakfast. We tried the steak with poached eggs and bread in a cup. I ordered some extra sides (avocado, eggs, etc.) and there was definitely enough food for two people. The prices are on the higher side which is why it's 4-stars, but it's a nice place to have a family breakfast. They have outdoor seating for nice days or if you are bringing a furry companion.",

This is officially our FAVORITE breakfast place EVER! -- FAIR WARNING: Once you eat here it's going to be hard to eat at places like Denny's and IHOP again, it's that good!  My wife had Chicken and Waffles with Pot of Bread (Cinnamon) and iced tea.  I had Steak and chilaquiles (just a fancy word for nachos) with eggs over easy + French Pressed coffee to drink -- I also ordered some extra gravy with the biscuit that came with my meal  Our whole meal was about $35... not too bad.  Everything tasted PERFECT -- The coffee had me on 10,000 hyper mode and my appetite kicked in... and the added surprise was that the \"nachos\" had this BBQ beans on it -- you let that egg run + avocado + bbq beans + sour cream and the blend is CRAZY GOOD  My wife said it was the best fried chicken she's ever had and the batter they used was to die for. The waitress was sweet enough to give my wife some FREE cinnamon cream cheese stuff (that NORMALLY goes on the red velvet pancakes) for her pot of bread because the waitress tried it herself before and was basically suggesting we try that. Love tips like this.",

The food and service are great but depending on what time of day (and day of the week) you go, there might be a bit of a wait because it seems to have become a pretty popular place to eat breakfast and brunch!  Once you order, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I really love the eggs Benedict & their orange juice is delicious as well. My biggest complaint is that I don't live in Vegas so I can't try everything on the menu :)",

    "text": "I'm still annoyed about our wait. When you quote someone a wait time, your estimate should at the very least be within a ten minute window, not over three times as long as your quote.   They also ran out of potted bread that day, which I was excited to try after reading other Yelp reviews. Our server told us that it would be another half hour wait for that menu item. Obviously, since we waited over an hour doe our table, I passed.   That being said, the food and service here were both excellent. I had the chilaquiles, and my boyfriend opted for a standard breakfast dish with pancakes and bacon with eggs. Both dishes came out hot and delicious and in a prompt manner. While I'm glad we stayed to try this place out, I really do think the door staff could use some training on estimating wait times. Even after I complained to the hostesses that we had waited for over an hour, a manager never spoke to us to apologize. As I've worked in the industry for over fifteen years, I thought this was pretty unacceptable.",

I ate there a few days ago and saw that they had knocked out a wall and expanded. I thought, oh good for them, because they are always busy. Then I started looking through the menu and realized it had changed, but not for the better. The prices of everything had gone up and toast or a pot of bread that was included with dishes before,  was no longer. I ordered a chicken and waffle which I've had a couple times before. The other times, the chicken,  which is always huge,  sat atop thick waffle...not this time. The waffle was thin as a pancake and had not been poured with enough batter to be whole. Our server took our order and brought us the check, but nothing in between. The thing that got to me the most about the whole visit was the fact that this place has had loyal patrons in the community and then they jack up the prices & give you less, like they are on the strip serving tourists. Way to ruin a good thing.",

Customer service was...meehhhhh.  THE REVIEW: I ordered the steak and eggs bagel. The steak was cooked great, the bacon was good, and the amount of food was insane. I ordered it with a side of fries. I was munching away, actually rather enjoying my bagel sandwich, when I was unpleasantly surprised by a sharp poke in my mouth. I had bitten into a toothpick that had been left in the steak. The toothpick had been used to hold the filet medallion inside the wrapped bacon. Now, I wasn't seriously injured, but it was an unpleasant sensation at the very least. I informed the waitress who apologized, and about 5 minutes later a man (whom I take it was a chef) came out and apologized. We get the bill of $34 for our breakfast, which surprised me. I have always been under the impression that when your food isn't cooked/presented appropriately (which I would consider foreign objects left in my food \"not cooked/presented appropriately\"), that you never charge the customer for that item. I was definitely disappointed with this, but neglected to argue or contest this. To me it should have been up to the management to make that decision on their own, and it will most definitely influence my decision in the future as to whether or not to patronize this establishment again.  Would I come here again? Probably not. Would I recommend this place to others? Possibly. Have not decided yet.",

Featuring a kitschy design with floral umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and servers in their pajamas plus a menu of breakfast and lunch classics ranging from classic egg dishes to more novel options such as red velvet pancakes service was spot on despite the early morning rush and with my order placed within moments of seating coffee and water remained filled to the brim at all times.  With good service and fun decor it was my hope that the food at Rise & Shine would indeed shine but perhaps because I didn't order \"Steak & Eggs\" the selections I tasted were average at best, the sort of place where big portions trump high quality ingredients - the chicken crispy but largely flavorless over a hotel lobby quality waffle and the pot of bread tasting mostly like yeast, something that Log Cabin 'syrup' and butter did not remedy.  Better in quality but still marred by low quality ingredients the French Toast would fare the best of the morning's options but given the location and the cost I can name no less than a dozen restaurants more deserving of the 'best breakfast vegas' title.",

I like my coffee to stay hot and am normally let down with slow refills but I had to tell her no thank you a couple times which totally impressed me!   On the negative, I was seated at the bar and for the entire 45 minutes I had to look at two of the three chefs inappropriate and disgusting attire. One cook was young with a backwards skater hat on with pants halfway down his backside showing off his grey underwear while wearing a short tee shirt. The main chef was older in what looked like his 40's and was even worse. Biker bandana, biker chain to wallet, short shirt, and pants that were BELOW halfway down his backside with all to see his black boxers with gold designs on them??? Are we supposed to be impressed by his \"ganstaness\" or disgusted? Why do I pay good money to eat great food and have to look at two cooks butts the entire meal? Looks like there's no overseeing by management to prevent such a business mishaps. If you go to eat and want to enjoy your food without seeing someone's backside the entire meal, DON'T sit at the bar!",

The service was great. We could tell our waitress was busy but she took the time to ask us how we were doing and showed us how to work the French press without talking to us in a rushed tone.

I LOVE breakfast but it's hard for me to enjoy at most places because I don't eat beef or pork. Despite the fact that they are a \"steak n eggs\" place, this place has more then a few options for people like me. Although not very healthy, I love their chicken and waffles.... The portion size is large but it is great to take to go for a later day snack. I am also a huge fan of the fact that they serve coffee in a French press which is my absolute FAV way to enjoy some joe. The only complaint I have is that they do seem to run out of things frequently. Especially the infamous pot of bread. Other then that, service is always fast and friendly. Food is good. Wait is never as outrageous as some places (but we don't go on Sat). Nice job Rise and Shine.",

I'm glad we arrived when we did, because within 5 minutes (no exaggeration) there was a 25-30 minute wait.  And, people stayed.  So, given that the regulars were willing to wait a half hour, I figured we were going to enjoy a solid breakfast.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  I chose the pot of bread, which was brought out early as an appetizer of sorts.  It was warm, and the butter served alongside was room temperature, so spreading was easy.  l liked the cinnamon flavor in the bread, but I think I would have preferred some toast or a biscuit with my meal rather than this bread prior.  The steak itself is a good size, and thick for a chicken fried steak.  This was an issue, as some of the areas were not as tender as I prefer.  I think the meat needed more tenderizing prior to preparation.  Also, it did not appear to be seasoned.  If the meat had seasoning prior to breading, even just some salt and pepper, it would really elevate this dish.  That being said, it was very good, particularly with the tasty sausage gravy.    The accompanying scrambled eggs were very fluffy.  They were fluffy to the point that they stand out among just about every other place I've ordered eggs in this town.  You get a substantial order of potatoes, which were above average.  I ordered them well done, and was glad I did.  My wife's order had barely any color on them, and I prefer them crunchy.  Servers wear pajamas and were very friendly, which was great.  My tea glass got close to empty once, but she was right there with a refill.  Excellent service overall.  Will we return?  It's not likely given the distance from our house.  But, if I was in the area again I absolutely would eat here and recommend you do the same.",

    "text": "First time here and was disappointed! One of my daughter lives near this shopping center and suggested this place. My other daughter and I we're on our way out and wanted something quick and togo. I ordered a burrito which they customized since there was only about 3 or4 items for there burrito selection. Also asked to cut burrito in half and they said they couldn't do it since it would fall apart. Not True, for what I had asked for I know for a fact  it would not! A $14.50 burrito, bacon, hash browns,eggs and cheese. Had maybe 2 small stripes of bacon, very very small amount of hash browns. Tasted more like an egg burrito. Maybe they don't specialize in burritos but quality should be in all there items. Again very disappointed",

They use to give everyone this amazing pot of bread with your meal and now it is extra so that makes me a little sad. The chicken fried steak is to die for, chicken and waffles is amazing too but it's that waffle that blows my tastebuds away. I'm not a waffle fan but this is the only waffle I've ever tasted that is moist, fluffy, and full of flavor. To top it off they make their own syrup with vanilla and cinnamon inside that make u keep it dripping for more. About $15 a person so not a cheap breakfast spot but you will have leftovers.",

The poached egg tasted really weird and lost all the egg taste and texture. The steak was unseasoned and the hash browns were meh. Even the plain bagel it came with was terrible. I've never found a bagel I didn't like until this place. The pancakes were ok. It was a little weird of how crumbly they were though.  Sometimes when you are hungry enough even average food tastes awesome but it didn't work here. Almost everything was terrible.",

Especially if you come in after the morning rush since multiple tables stay dirty for long periods of time.   There are important factors other than food that make a cafe a good one, in my opinion.   We tried their Summerlin location but that one has even worse customer service. It must be a chain thing.   Save yourself some money and time.   There are way too many great breakfast places in this city to go to a mediocre one like this one.",

Yes, it is clear across town, yes, we're up by Mt. Charleston, Yes, I am that person who'll drive AAAAAAALL the way to Hendertucky for the best Snow Ice in town, and Yes, there are too many whiner vaginers who make a big deal because of the distance travelling farther than outside of their hood....two answers for you-1) Stay home, or 2) Make like Rhianna and SHUT UP AND DRIVE!!!!  Breakfast/Brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day, and we're always looking for another spot to add into our breakfast/brunch rotation. I like the quirky atmosphere here. Everyone is so welcoming as you walk in, spinning umbrellas up on the ceiling, waitresses in pajamas like they just rolled out of bed ready to serve you. Puts a smile on your face..:) One weird thing was the \"Help us...Yelp us\" on the back of the busboys' shirts. Don't know if that's against Yelp policy, but its not like they need to do that....They have a great fan base, and great food!  Menu selections here are plentiful, and our waitress Riley was AWESOME SAUCE! She was very informative, personable, and offered up suggestions, popular items, and even her personal favorites. when we narrowed it down, we split the Fried Chicken Breast and Waffles and The Ultimate Steak and Eggs Plate, with the potted bread(Took a page from Jamms?) as our bread choice, with some fresh squeezed OJ(they use Navel, not Valencia) Two HUGE chicken breasteses were fried to perfection-crisp, well seasoned exterior, and the inside stayed nice and juicy and went perfectly with the crisp, light waffle drizzled with the cinnamon infused syrup, which was unfortunately Log Cabin. The ribeye was a perfect medium rare as requested, and the hash browns were not your typical out of the box type and you can tell it was made in house. Nice and crisp on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside. As popular as they are, the potted bread didn't arrive until after we were done with breakfast. No one's fault though, as Riley even offered another bread choice, we chose to wait. Its kinda like a little Cinnabon in a flower pot that comes with a cream cheese glaze on the side and was a great ending to our meal.  Definitely can't wait to come back to attack their Sweet Cream Pancakes, Chilaquiles, and other popular items.   ALOHA!!!",

The couple next to us waited 45 minutes for their food, and their order was wrong. We were extremely disappointed, especially in the service. The staff did not care to check on the progress of our order, when we asked continually. Will never go to this location again. Very disappointing.",

The steak was made perfect. Moist but, over done like South Point's steak.  Super excited that they serve my favorite coffee ever-in-life: Illy. Yessss, ILLY IS ILL!  Love that the waitresses are all in pajamas; and the decor is just bright and makes u wanna wake up in the morning! --- I mean, besides the fact that I'm a morning person and all.

I wondered if it's one of those figure of speech things.  Later on i found out nope; she just a crappy waitress after all.  Second we waited 30 minutes for our food.  Third the people that sat after us got their orders in approx 10 minutes after sitting down.  Fourth, took 12 min to see a manager.  Fifth, my server said she was the manager and she was in the back handling some hostess issue that's why I didn't see her for approx 40 min.  6th my loco mono rice was dry and hard like it was sitting out all day; not only hard on the surface but throughout the rice.  7th told the server/manger about the crappy dry/hard rice and have her touch it and she says \"I didn't cook it\".  So she took it off my check.  I lost approx 1 hour of my time and came home to eat frozen pizza cause I'm still hungry.",

The food was delicious and our 11 year old son said his pancakes were the best he'd tasted. My husbands ham steak was fantastic and my avo Benedict was incredible. The atmosphere was so cute with their morning theme and the wait staff in PJ's. Our waitress Cary was so friendly and efficient which topped off this great dining experience! Will definitely be back and let our family and friends know not to miss!",

We didn't make a big deal about it, just asked for another coffee. After ordering our food we waited for 55 minutes and nothing. We asked one of the waitresses and said she would check. We waited 5 minutes for an answer and again nothing! At this point we've had enough and decided to leave. Not once did our coffees get refilled. This is THE WORST EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD!",

We were seated promptly but completely ignored by our server. Another server took our order and got us drinks. The last time we went, they were very busy. I ordered coffee and it came about 15 minutes later but not the way I ordered it, so it was sent back. My husband had to go to pick it up from the window. Very weird that you never see a manager and servers feel no sense of urgency.",

Then after a while, I saw him being so nice and talkative and helping the other table explaining almost everything on the menu. While he didn't even let us know that the full order is too big for 2 kids.   Then the food. I got my usual, chicken and waffle. But got disappointed on how small it was. I would've understand if their price went up. But when the food price went up, I'd expect that it'll still be as big (the quality is still good) the chicken was just half what it used to be. So that was disappointing. I was looking forward to leftovers, but no leftovers since it was small.  I don't think we'll be back for a while.",

    "text": "It's my dad's first time in Vegas after at least 14years. I wanted to take him to M resort studio buffet but found out they no longer have breakfast. Oh no!!!  I quickly yelp'd around the nearest breakfast places and found these guys. The pot of bread seemed like a unique idea and the photos looked great!   Arrived at around 830am. Quaint little place in a shopping plaza. Loved how the servers wear Jammies (must be the best work uniform ever).  Decor: simple. I honestly do not remember anything that stuck out besides the turning floral umbrellas on the ceiling and the \"cow and egg\" advertisement on the wall.   Orange juice: to my surprise, freshly squeezed.  Dads steak and eggs: steak was very tender and eggs cooked to a perfectly requested sunny side up.   The hash: very unique. They look like flat pasta noodles cut in smaller segments. It tasted very fresh with a perfect crunch.   My chicken fried steak: my steak was also very flavorful and tender. It was paired with a delicious gravy. I am not a big chicken fried steak fan but damn, this was good.   Husband's chicken and waffle: the portion size was good. Nicely breaded chicken breast with a waffle. Chicken was tender and juicy despite being fried.   Their pot of bread became 'tea cup bread' when we visited. It did not look too appealing since the shape was funky and some overfilled the cup. However, they were nice and warm out of the oven and very, very delicious. Dad and I are not fans of sweet bread but this was perfectly flavored with cinnamon and a bit of sweetness. Butter and tea cup bread for the win!  Pricing: a bit higher than your normal breakfast restaurant but hey, you're paying for fresh food. Totally worth it!  I am very glad our hotel decided to cancel their breakfast buffet because we got to experience something new and not your usual Vegas meal :)  I would definitely recommend and return at my next trip!!",

I was there on a Monday morning around 11AM there was no wait. This was my first time here, but my friend had been there quite often because he lives right down the street.  He had the french toast with 3 eggs and bacon (apparently he's a growing boy - don't know how he ate it all, PLUS a slice of MY bacon!). I had just the standard breakfast with 2 eggs, hash browns and bacon. We both ordered the \"pot of bread,\" and he ordered an extra for himself (I seriously don't know where he put all this food).  Everything was really good, although I am not a big fan of their style of hash browns. The service was fast and friendly and I will definitely be back because I really want to try one of their signature steak dishes.",

When a person orders a steak request medium and recieves something they can not put a knife through is absurd.

Case in point order a medium receive a well done piece of rubber where a hacksaw could not cut through. or recieve on a second request fatty plate that has blood in it. DO yourself a favor not only avoid the non fully cook hasbrowns avoid recieving a belly ache , save your money at 12+ DOLLARS A PLATE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ...

Food is marginal at best. They mess up the order and don't even care. And theres also some huge fat slob (I think the owner) who just sits there an eats and doesn't help seat people or do anything about the fact that te place is totally understaffed. Looking at the owner alone is enough to make someone lose their appetite. I'll never go back to this place!",

    "text": "The boyfriend finally agreed to go out for breakfast and this made me beyond happy. The place: Rise and Shine in Southern Highlands. Very quaint, family-run breakfast/lunch spot.  We arrived just after 11 and had a 20 min wait. Thank goodness for the gorgeous Fall weather.  Our name was finally called and a 10-13 year old brought us to our table. Normally, the idea of children working in a restaurant annoys me. Restaurants is a serious business and throwing your underaged kids in the mix is more distracting than it is helpful. But at R&S, this little one was very mature and informative.  Pleasant surprise.  The wait staff are garbed in PJ sets to match the name of the restaurant. Clever. But the food...not overly complicated and that's how I like my favorite meal of the day.  -Corned beef hash with eggs: yum! Not my typical choice but happy I did this time. -Peanut Butter and Blueberry jam French toast: this was a buffer dish in case the hash didn't work out but then I just ended up way stuffed. -Spiced Rib eye steak and eggs: this was the bf's meal. Served with the egg atop nachos instead of the meat was odd and looked very heavy to me. He said it wasn't bad. The streak was seasoned well as I had to try at least one piece.  There are no TVs for distraction so it's a great place for families with kids. Can't wait to go back to try their pot of cinnamon bread as they ran out this time.  Food was good but service will make me a repeat guest.",

They serve my favorite coffee (illy) and offer these cute little plant pots of cinnamon bread. (FYI; you need to arrive early to receive a pot of bread. They only make 100 a day) The prices are a little high for breakfast but you do receive a good portion of food. There's a variety of items on the menu to choose from. I will definitely visit again to enjoy my illy coffee and try something new.",

    "text": "Normally I would give this place a 4 Star review, but on Sunday May, 3 2015 that all changed.  Granted this place is packed on the weekends and to keep pace with the knashing carnivors waiting anxiously to get in and get there feed on, the staff in nasty pajamas has to be on point with the kitchen.  This seems obvious right?  Well on Sunday there was a line out the door, normal, and the experience started like this:  The hostess, a girl I had not seen before and unfortunately did not get her name, asked us how many and told us that there would be a 15-20 min wait.  So I looked to the Bar which no one was at and asked if we could sit there.  First she eye rolled me and then said I don't know.  I asked if she could check and again the same exasperated eye roll that she might have fallen backwards from, \"Ill check,\" she said.  I waited 5 min while she talked to severs, played with her pen and gave the general I could give a rats hind end about you as a customer look and finally I asked if she even asked any one (of which she didn't because I was watching like a hawk with a caged animal in my stomache ready to leap from its depths and attack on site).  Also, I wasnt the only annoyed one as all the people were talking about how rude that hostess was.  She is definately not the face any owner would want at the FOH.  Lazy, non-caring, and rude.  While sitting waiting for Griselda the Mean to get back to me, I looked around and there were 6-8 four tops sitting with dirty dishes on them which would have acomodated most of the people outside waiting.  Those table stayed dirty for exactly 15 min before they started to be cleared.  This whole team led by there Manager Jessica, who didn't lift a finger to help any one and simply walked around with a face that could sink a1000 ships and then complained about the customers attitudes only a few feet from me.  Maybe its just me but the Manager should be the buisiest person in the restaurant, cleaning making sure that customers are taken care of, smiling, greeting, not hiding in corners and avoiding the crazy crowd that had acumulated outside the door.  Jessica only became interested in us when we asked for a comment card.  Then she couldn't stop walking behind me and my girlfriend looming over to get a peek at what was being written.  So unprofessional.  She was training...if you want to call it that, a server by the name of Cali for management, who was AWESOME.  She was sooooo weeded and still she took the time to come by and make sure that we were ok at least 3 times.  Great job on the floor Cali, hopefully you will be replacing Jessica so very soon!!  Food...well it was satisfactory this time.  My steak came out mooing at me, way rare (I ordered medium), and the hashbrowns were raw and I think if I equated it to a measuring cup I got a bout 1/3 of a cup of hashbrowns and the eggs over easy were dripping with oil, saturating everything on the plate.  The open air kitchen was getting slammed, plates were being thrown on the floor by the line cooks, (Seriously?) the cooks were openly swearing at the servers and calling them horrible names behind the line only 2 feet from me and I was able to hear everything.  Sloppy plating and the list goes on.  My girlfriend said here omlet was good but the pot of bread she ordered was raw about an inch down in the cup.  Sorry Rise and Shine, normally you all are so on point and friendly and look so comfy in your designer flannel pajamas.  Please understand people normally this place is the bomb, but under the horrible leadership that day it all came crashing down.",

    "text": "Worth the 8 minute detour from the interstate of you are looking for a brunch time meal away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  There is something about places that beg me to leave a good review on Yelp!. Bus boys wear t-shirts that say \"Help us...Yelp! us.\" A sign hangs in the window advertising that people like them on Yelp!. Then,  at the end of your meal,  a 20 question survey is handed to you with another Help Us,  Yelp! us advertisement.  I don't need your constant reminders to leave a good review, just quality service and great food. Also,  if you want me to leave a review,  provide me with free wifi since your network shows up as the strongest of the many networks in the area (3 of which are free).  That said,  we received quality service and great food.  My fiance and I shared their Country fried steak and eggs,  hashbrowns, biscuit,  and a side of corn beef hash. The steak was prepared in a great batter;  very crispy,  not hard,  thick,  but not overwhelming.  Gravy was served on the side and was very tasty.  Hash Browns are more like a mix between hash browns and home fries... home fried hash browns, maybe? The fluffy and crispy biscuit came out late,  but it was topped with sausage gravy at no charge... nice! Also,  the corned beef hash was a very good addition to this meal. We left very full and ready for a nap,  to bad we have a 4.5 hour drive ahead of us.   The food was matched with great service from the time we signed in to paying the bill.  Good job,  now lose the Help Us, Yelp! Us shirts, it's tacky and unnecessary given the quality food and service you have. You'd receive 5 stars if you didn't have the Yelp! requests everywhere.",

The decor is absolutely adorable - hanging flowers are all over the place and the wait staff wears really cute pajamas - love it!   The food we tried was all very good. My husband had the blueberry french toast strudel . It was like a slice of a delicious casserole. If you're in the mood  for sweet but not disgustingly so, I recommend this! We also tried the chicken and waffles which was good, especially if you haven't had Roscoe's. It was much, much better than the one at HHAGG, and at this point the best I've had in Vegas. It was a big chicken breast instead of fried chicken which did make it much easier to eat. The waffle was pretty boring, but well executed. The chicken was a touch spicy, and the whole thing was served with cinnamon syrup. I would get it again, but I can't say it's crave-worthy.   Biggest bummer about this place was service was a disaster. Drinks were late and forgotten, the pot of bread supposed to be served prior to the meal was brought after, etc, etc. They all seemed very rushed and stressed out. Given how brand new this place is, they get a pass, but I would hope the service improves in the future!   It's no Babycakes, but it does hold its' own. In a sea of breakfast spots at every corner, this place deserves a spot in anyone's short list .",

Waitstaff was friendly, but not good about checking in. The decor was nice--the umbrellas hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. The a/c was blasting and ice cold. While a/c is obviously appreciated, it's not fun to eat while I'm shivering. While there was nothing terrible about this restaurant, it's too pricy and too far out of our way for us to consider returning.",

We get up and go to our waitress who is by the kitchen and she tells us it has not been started yet and is extremely apologetic. Not her fault but the cook, who actually didn't give a damn, said he wasn't going to start it if we were leaving. What kind of customer service does this place have? How about trying to get the situation corrected? We got screwed. AND this place has usually very acceptable service when they are jam packed on the weekends. I hope the owners care enough to read this.",

Came in around 9:30 on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 15 minutes - Grab a Vegas & Seven magazine next to the hostess stand to pass the time. This place is worth the wait!  I opted for the Pot of Bread, the omelet and hashbrowns.    Pot of Bread - excellent, medium sized with the perfect amount of cinnamon twist.    Omelet - My go to is usually egg whites with spinach & onions - I saw kielbasa for an option and my polish heart just couldn't resist.  Perfectly cooked & great portion sizes.  Hashbrowns - now i am VERY particular when it comes to my hashbrowns - I despise breakfast potatoes & am a huge fan of crispy.  These hashbrowns were not your normal thick breakfast has browns, but instead thin and crispy.  Probably the best hashbrowns I have ever had.    All & all i will be adding this to my list of favorites.  Very nice to actually sit, eat and visit in a home-cooked setting.  Not in a casino - not in a bar, but in a great neighborhood.",

    "text": "This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas so far. I have been going here for over two years. Previously was close to my place (it's just off cactus and Decatur/southern highlands parkway) but now I happily drive there.   The wait can be long sometimes and no reservations. So go early! It is a small place. But worth a wait (never too long anyways) if you are a late-comer.   The menu is great. Lots of options but especially great because all the food is amazing! My personal favorite is the New York steak spinach and Benedict bagel. I opt for the everything bagel. The hollandaise sauce with the balsamic flavor on top of perfectly poached eggs and fresh spinach and a steak is nothing to complain about. Their hash browns are delicious too. Shaved yet thick... And have a buttery crispness to them. Love!  They also make these little cinnamon breads in clay pots \"pot o bread\" that is wonderful. Now... This used to be more wonderful when they made homemade jam with chunks of strawberries... But it's still delicious with butter or the packaged jam. OR I have been known to get a small side of the cheesecake icing or something they have so it is cinnamon bun like :) (recommended a while back by a waitress there)  The next best thing here is their coffee. IF you're a coffee fan they have an option of French press or regular brew. I always go for the regular brew which is ILLY coffee. This is one of my fave roasts :) so I usually take a cup to go since it's hard to find in the city.   You can tell the staff enjoy working there. I always see the same servers. Great atmosphere and great food means happy customers and happy staff :)  The next best thing would be... That mostly anything that can be split in half you can order a half order. The price is somewhat changed (half or so) and is nice because the portions can be way too big! Or in case you're split between two dishes... It isn't written on the menu BUT they are so accommodating. You'll see!!  Try it! You won't be disappointed. And IF by chance you are --- let them know and in a jiffy they will correct it... That you'll forget anything wasn't perfect and still leave there smiling!!   My only downside would be the price.  Somehow I would like to see somewhat smaller portions and a slightly lower price. That is what makes me not go there as often. I feel breakfast should be max 10 per person. Not 15... But that would be my only complaint..  YUM! Salivating writing this... Can't wait to go back!",

The staff are all wearing jammies lol   The restaurant is clean except for a few tables that weren't cleaned, probably because they didnt have enough people for that big place.  I'm not one to complain- but the service sucked. Also, they had 3 wifi connections and they cant even share it. Lol food is ok, nothing really special about it. We had corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy. Maybe next time I'll try their steak and eggs.",

The breakfast menu was extensive. We placed different orders, we were all please with how delicious everything was. They handled the needs children well. My husband's waffles were the best he'd  ever eaten and he's tried a lot of them. My red velvet pancakes were excellent and a large portion.

And the workers are dressed in their cute little pajamas.   * This is my first time at Rise & Shine, so I've only tried the Steak and eggs. Although, for the only thing I've tried, it's given me a great first impression. I accidentally said the wrong cooking temperature for the steak, so that's my fault. But the flavor was still great and savory. The hash browns were probably my favorite. It had so much flavor and little crunchy bits that I love so much.   * The price, I believe, was around $15. A little high on the price, but for steak, I guess it's acceptable.   * Would I go again? Yeah sure. I think I would want to try their other options next time, but it's a great breakfast place to go to.   * Rate: 8/10 * $$",

    "text": "After a rather lackluster first visit to the other Rise & Shine location on Flamingo, it's with disappointment that I note that the original location also failed to rise to the occasion of a great breakfast.  All puns aside, I do really want to like this place. Service is spot on and incredibly friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired for me I'm afraid. I found the fried chicken flavorless and dry, the waffle was a soggy mess and the chilaquiles were as well. The only thing from my meal that I halfway enjoyed were the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. They were good when paired with the flavorless and over-battered chicken to help make it more palatable.   Aside from the pancakes, the service was the only other saving grace about this place. I don't see myself making any extra effort to come back when there are much breakfast spots near me that have cheaper prices and better food.",

    "text": "The negative aspects:  The food is bad. I ordered their ultimate steak and eggs. This place is named for their steak and eggs, so I was expecting to have a stellar breakfast before my drive back to LA. What I got were disgusting eggs, a very low quality cut of meat, and hash browns that looked and tasted like badly cooked shredded potatoes with a bunch of oil splattered on them. I brought it to the attention of the waitress, who in turn brought it up to the manager. The manager spoke with me, insisting that they only buy the best type of meat. I knew better, as I've had steak and eggs in many different places throughout LA and SD. The only thing that tasted right was the toast, but it's pretty hard to screw that one up.  The positive aspects:  The customer service was on point. I was seated immediately, and the staff was very nice. And by nice, I mean they greeted me very warmly, and even expressed sympathy that I was not happy with the meal. I've seriously never been greeted this warmly by any restaurant staff member, so props to them.  Seeing as this was a one time occurrence, I will consider coming back here and trying out other dishes. Stay tuned for updates.",

The decor & the staff are all a little quirky, but in a good way. The steak & eggs were cooked perfectly. The steak had a correctly cooked  juicy medium inside, but the outside had a awesome texture, very similar to a nice high heat steak char. I believe they use a coffee ground rub on the steak. The eggs were scrambled & fluffy & the hash browns were plentiful & cooked properly. Bread in a cup choice was a nice added sweet enhancement to the breakfast. I would definitely visit again & try other delicious look items that were coming out of the kitchen.",

    "text": "The 1 star  for our waitress and our waitress ONLY. She was still training . So we had some compassion for her.  We have come here twice before but the service and food has always been mediocre. Its been about 8 months since our last visit so we decided to give it a go because of location convenience Came in this morning, ordered a kids breakfast and two adult breakfasts. My side dish of eggs and bacon, they eggs were WAY smaller than the kids eggs. Found that odd. They also forgot to put the cheese on them. Mentioned it to our server and she offered to have it fixed and I declined since we were on a time schedule because my husband was having breakfast with us on his work lunch break. I go to pick up a piece of my bacon and there is hair on it.... I also noticed the cook having a long beard and instead of them making him shave it due to health violations and cleanliness and professionalism, they made him wear a net over it ..... really?  Our waitress was very apologetic. They removed the $4.50 side plate. Hair in someone's food is disgusting and should absolutely never ever happen. The fact that the manager sent her back with a $5 coupon and our discount check, and he didn't even have not only the balls or the respect to come over and apologize to us shows their lack of care and customer service. But really, what would he say? There's no excuse for hair in someone's food because the bottom line is that is a result of the not so cleanliness of their kitchen. And as a server myself it's just unacceptable the lack of customer service as well. 1 stars for our server being sweet and professional, I feel bad that her manager had no balls and made her continuously apologize to us. We gave our coupon to the table over. I will also be notifying the health district . As well as never returning  Edit : the beard guard might be up to code with the health policy, but hair in my food is not .",

And the servers wear PJs! :)  No, I didn't get steak & eggs. But I did get a breakfast platter with pot of bread. Pot of bread is like a dinner roll and a cinnamon roll mixed in one. It basically tasted like bread with some cinnamon... It wasn't AS exciting as I thought it was going to be, but the presentation still gets a 5 star rating from me. The hashbrowns were thick cut and so tasty! The bacon was done perfect and they use real eggs!   I was very impressed with this cute breakfast spot and will definitely be back!",

Server was patient with us; coming back to check in on us a couple times.  This would have been a great time to upsell and offer suggestions.  From the time we placed our food order we sat for 25 minutes while we watched our food sit under the heat lamp.  If ever there was a need for a strong Expo - this would have been it.

They all greeted us warmly and checked up on us often!  The decor was so cute and fun! We enjoyed looking up at the floral parasols and tried  to figure out which ones were spinning and if there was some sort 2 pattern...  Food was great!  I cleared my plate of Salmon and Cream Cheese Omelette - so yummy!  And the Bread in the coffee cup was so fun and tasty, too!  We'll probably return if we are in Las Vegas again. It was such a pleasant experience with free parking, convenient location, and awesome food and service!",

He was apologetic, but could have done more by comping 10% off our bill or even giving us an extra side of bread. The bus boy seemed to think it was funny that a customer got drenched in water. Not really a good way to start my morning. The waiter was fine- she was hustling a lot of tables so I'm sure it was hard for her to attend to each table.  The food wasn't special either. My husband and I didn't like how greasy the food came out. We asked for crispy hash browns, not for it to be drenched in oil. The corned beef hash was okay, just would have liked for them to not skimp on the portions.  Not really sure why this place got so many hyped reviews. We are NOT coming back and I don't recommend either!!!",

Such a fun place away from the crowded strip. The restaurant was clean and playfully decorated. At first glance the menu is a little overwhelming but with excellent instruction from a pajama wearing waitress I was able to find what I wanted. This place has a little bit of everything including it's very own juice bar.   The homemade corn beef hash was fresh and very tasty. It was served with cubed hash and three well prepared over easy eggs. In lieu of my normal side of toast I opted for a cinnamon roll called \"Cup 'o Bread\". Very creative presentation. It was served in a cuye coffee cup and packed full of flavor.",

The waitress brought cold coffee over & we thought maybe she didn't serve it right away because she was busy. We stopped another server or busboy that was walking around looking like he was lost. He apologized & got us 2 fresh cups. They were even worse. We told our waitress and her response was \"but I can see them steaming...\" I told her to stick her finger in it & she looked at me like I was trying to set her up for injury ..to prove my point I stuck MY finger in the cup. She then did the same ... \"oh your right\". She brought 2 more cups from a different pot. They were better but not by much.   We didn't see her again until our food came. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese & Bangor sausage on the side. The sausage is the only reason for the 1 star. Great flavor.  How you can screw up a bagel is beyond me. Regardless, the waitress saw that I took one bite from it & didn't ask if there was a problem.   I won't waste my time or money to come here again. Instead, I will drive another 9 miles and go to Mimi's.",

I don't think we've ever waited more than 5 minutes, if at all. Food is just as good as the other location. My go-to is always steak and eggs. It's usually always delicious, except this last time the meat was quite fatty, and the last few times there's a lot of char from the grill left all over the steaks. Really gives it a burnt look and feels a bit gritty... not my favorite things in life, but tolerable. Fresh squeezed OJ is great. I didn't realize what \"bread in a cup\" was until my son ordered it... it's a cinnamon roll, but in a cup... and delicious! Portions are great, I always end up with leftovers.

You have to try one of their fruit parfaits because they are the best! If you're into waffles and pancakes and things like that for breakfast those are pretty excellent as well and then there's eggs more ways than you can think of. The decor is so cute with the parasols hanging from the ceiling and I love the theme where all the servers wear pajamas! The only downfall, and not for them, is that it can get very crowded and the service can take quite a while as in quite a while! So if you plan to visit here I suggest that you make time. Overall though, it's an excellent restaurant with an expansive menu. It's only a four star restaurant in my opinion because of the slow service on any given day.",

I'll NEVER go here again ID RATHER HUG A CACTUS  And speaking of Hugs that's what all these employees need is a HUG; they rude as FUCK   White White White --- no flavor.  mayonnaise - vanilla bean!!  The restaurant wasn't even crowded. This place is like going to chucky cheese but chucky has better customer service. I can't believe I was asked to go wait outside in a non crowded restaurant and she really like yelled it at me like I was her fucking child.   Y'all can go to this shitty ass place if y'all want to but I'm thinking to will be going out of Buisness soon anyways",

I asked for the hash browns crispy and the steak medium rare and that's exactly what I got. Great coffee(Lavazza) too. Not too expensive, considering the quality and freshness of the food. Friendly waitress too. The only thing I would say is maybe have some different jellies available. Altogether 5 stars and better than any diner I've tried on the strip or downtown.",

The decor is very cute, with the colorful flower umbrellas, and it must be nice to work in your PJs! Our waiter suggested the green smoothie, which was indeed just a teeny bit sweet from the honeydew melon. The cup of bread was amazing! Like a cinnamon roll with the cream cheese frosting on the side for dipping. We ended up ordering two of them! I got the avocado eggs Benedict with hash browns. The balsamic vinegar drizzled on top was a little different, but it worked! We would definitely return next time we're in Vegas!",

Interior decor is very cute as well.  Service was exceptional from the hostess to our server - no complaints here!   Why 3 stars?   Corn beef hash was a very small serving size and I've had better. The breakfast burrito was huge but tasted okay. One thing to note is that the retried beans were EXTRA salty. Maybe it was just a bad batch but it was horribly salty and the part of it that touched the burrito made my burrito super salty. I'm usually a fan of breakfast burritos so I was disappointed here.   We got banana pancakes as well - this was delicious! The pancakes were the highlight of the meal, but otherwise the food was okay.   Prices were a little on the high side in my opinion, especially for mediocre food (with the exception of banana pancakes).  My overall experience was good, but the food - I'm not sure if I'd come back because I didn't have anything that stood out.",

    "text": "It is truly an early bird who catches a worm as the saying goes. My guess is that they've consumed some of the amazing eats from this gem of a restaurant while on the prowl.  On a recent visit with my Dad we ended up here back to back days during the trip and our only complaint was that the food was so scrumptious here that it pained us to leave the remains of the unconsumed on the plate. You certainly can share without embarrassment here as the portions (on most items) are enough to feed an army!  Before I get into the main attraction I do want to point out from top to bottom the staff here. Once again they are beyond inviting and the genuine care they portray to each table of patrons is a staple that they are well worth the 5 star rating from not just myself, but the other masses as well who choose to dine within those walls. I really feel so at home there and that is a special gift!  For day #1 I had my heart set on trying something different so I went for the red velvet chocolate chip pancakes. Those are a MUST if you have a craving for a \"short\" stack, but there is nothing short about that stack by any means. I was served 4 huge battered circular halos and with literal chunks of chocolate chips how can you go wrong? They were quite fluffy overall and the after taste of chocolate in each bite partnered with the cream cheese syrup it comes partnered with left me feeling like I was sharing a sunrise with Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory!  For day #2 I scaled it back a bit and devoured the pot of bread and the three egg breakfast with bacon on the side. It was simplistic in nature with just eggs, hash browns, and bacon however even in a simple form the food is still on point. The bacon (being the high point) was crispy and had a slight smoky tint to it that elevated it to a whole other level. I actually had a full on body shake because it was so amazing!  With top notch consistent hospitality, this is by far my #1 breakfast destination when I am in the area and it's been fun to watch the growing cult following they are getting as time goes on. To keep it simple, people know what's up!",

I love bagel sandwiches and my husband can never turn down chilliquiles, so when our waitress recommended the two, we instantly knew what to order.  He had the Steak and Chilliquiles and his steak was cooked as asked. I had the AvoVeggie Bagel Sandwich with fries. The shoe string fries were well seasoned and delicious! My only complaint was that the big selling point for me was fresh mashed avocado on my bagel... and instead it was not fresh, but more like whipped and browning... the flavor was a bit old and masked the flavor of the entire sandwich. I did try a bite of my husband's Chilliquiles and that ranchero flavor was grand! We shared a French Press Coffee that averaged a little over 3 cups of coffee. The decor of the restaurant was very bright and fun. I think we will try this place again, but will stay away from the avocado.",

Certainly not Steakhouse quality or even quality of like the Outback but better than what you get on the Midnight Special in a cafe in the casino. The potatoes were killer!! Not a bad meal for the price but not great I mean all in the place is alright. We might go back again but it's definitely not a place I'm going to tell anybody they must stop at.",

Professional juice bar, open kitchen, LavAzza French press coffee, waitresses wearing pajamas, just a fun place.  First up were the amazing homemade popovers with a maple infused cream delicious dipping sauce.  Main course was the well seasoned and properly charcoal grilled rib eye steak with 2 eggs over and nice crunchy hash browns.  Clearly a 4 star plus breakfast winner, will return for fried chicken and waffles tomorrow.",

I've never seen a restaurant pump out truly authentic southern classics like sausage gravy and biscuits while also delivering as close to a homemade chilaquiles as I've ever eaten!!  Everything on the menu is fantastic and the service (delivered in quirky striped pajamas) is friendly and efficient.  Gelato has taken care of me almost every time I have been here.  She knows the menu, makes awesome recommendations, and it quickly becoming one of my favorite parts of coming here. If you're looking for the best brunch in Southern Highlands, you'll find it at Rise & Shine!!",

Located in the corner of an unassuming strip mall is this high quality breakfast spot.   While the steak and eggs is the go-to (and they sure looked delicious), we went with a normal pancakes, eggs and bacon breakfast combo. It was so large that we ended up sharing it for the two. Awesome bacon and fantastic pancakes.  For the amount of food and the price, you really can't beat it.   Nice and quick service as well.",

When we arrived, the hostess told us a total of over $40! We ordered a bagel sandwich, French toast, and 2 orange juices!!! We were shocked at the price because the menu we ordered from had completely different prices. It stated $2.85 for an orange juice, and we were told they raised the prices and it was now $5 for a small orange juice, the size of a kids cup!! They did NOT update their menu or prices online, did not give us a total over the phone, and really expected us to pay $10 for a few sips of orange juice? The food was decent, but the hashbrowns were mushy and flavorless, instead of crispy and salty. The bagel sandwich was okay, but nothing worth $15!! We will never be back here again. The prices are insane and the food is not worth it.",

Anyways, ordered a cup of coffee, normally I love coffee in the morning but this cup was kind of old, the coffee tasted like it was sitting for awhile but I downed it anyway due to there only being one server. It wasn't too busy, but it was enough to keep one person running around. I ordered the country fried steak and it was good definitely had a zip to it, the eggs weren't over easy but fried...the hashbrowns weren't bad, and of course I'm digging the pot of bread! I hate complaining because I've worked in the food and beverage industry for a long time, so I eat what I eat unless it was raw or cold then I wouldn't. But this was mediocre. It definitely has changed since the first time I was here, so it's kind of disappointing.  They should have put at least one more person on the floor so that someone can always make sure that coffee cups were filled and water cups were filled.   4 stars were given because besides the food and the service its a beautiful restaurant and it has potential and I hope it's worked on and not forgotten when the new restaurant is built.",

We waited an additional 30 minutes after ordering for us to receive half our food,  calling it was warm would be a stretch.  We watched our server serve multiple other tables in other sections before serving us.  We finally got our toast and it was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt.  This place is a great place if you want to waste an hour and a half of your life waiting for deplorable servers to serve you cold food. Have fun!",

The second time, we waited in line for 20 mins, then waited another 20 mins for someone to help us, then waited another 20 mins for coffee before we walked out.    Third time, we managed to get sat, again the server was inattentive (waited a long time to get drinks) and got our very slowly made order wrong (my husband always orders eggs over hard, with emphasis and they came back runny).    Today, we decided to give it another shot, and were seated next to a woman who was talking on her speakerphone.  It made an already loud cafe unbearable.  Management should have asked the woman to step outside for her call.  We walked out and the hostess was unapologetic and a little snippy.  We will not be going back for another try.",

He says the other 2 meals will up out shortly and will bring a menu back to me so I can order something else. We decided to just leave without the food... This doesn't include the server calling me \"sir\", telling us about how cranky he is in the morning and sharing about how he wrote 'iced' for our waters and couldn't remember if it was tea or water.

They are very busy in the weekends but seem to get people through fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the green juice to start and then ordered the classic steak and 2 egg breakfast.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and he loved it too.  Go give it a try!",

The ambience and decor is so cute and colorful.   The food was wonderful - their signature pot of bread and ultimate steak and eggs were delicious! I also loved the hazelnut Nutella coffee - I personally liked the latte better than the cappuccino but that's because it was sweeter. The cappuccino was stronger and more coffee flavored.   Definitely a gem in vegas and will be going back!",

Rise & Shine is located on the far Southside off the 15 freeway of Silverado Ranch Blvd.  At this joint, they offer some serious quality breakfast in exceptional presentation. I have already visited this place twice in less than a week. All for good reason.  On my first visit, I tried the Ultimate steak & eggs breakfast which consisted of a massive and juicy 8oz rib eye steak. Along with my meat was hash browns and 3 egg whites. It's about $14+ but you get what you pay for. This is one massive meal and a quality that you can't find at South Point or wherever the hell you go for your midnight steak & eggs.  On my second visit, I tried the Ham & Eggs Benedict on a English bagel. Though I'm not much of a Ham & Eggs Benedict type of person, it was tasty as well! Served with your standard hash browns.  Already came here twice and looking forward to a 3rd time to see how the corned beef hash is. Apparently, it's made fresh from scratch so can't wait to give that a try.  Service was great as well! Servers were all attentive and courteous. They even wear pajamas to resemble an early-day atmosphere.",

This place has an awesome menu - I had a hard time deciding, so I went for eggs eggs Benedict because it's my fave. Doug and the baby had pancakes and Doug had bacon on the side. He also ordered watermelon strawberry juice, which he didn't like. I took a sip and can see why - it's an all natural juice with no added sugar. Not really a kids beverage; I, on the other hand, loved it.  They brought out warm syrup!!! That wowed me. But the pancakes didn't need it. They were fluffy and light and had their own sweetness to them that made them delicious plain. The eggs Benedict had an unexpected but interesting balsamic reduction drizzled on top that made me an instant fan. I didn't get to try Doug's bacon because he devoured all 5 pieces before I got a chance but it looked great. Sightly thick and cooked perfectly.   The decor was cute, umbrellas for lights and fans and the servers wore pjs:) LOVED IT!!  If I lived in Vegas, this would be my go to breakfast place!",

I was greeted and waited on immediately.  The reason I haven't went before is that their prices are extremely high. That is my only complaint and still is. I almost got up and left but decided to try something. I saw they had an over 55 menu but was very limited. I ordered the very small steak with one egg and hash browns . They brought it on this little dish all clumped together.  The food was very good.  Price $8.60 with tax. I left hungry.  They could have put it on a bigger plate and gave more hash browns in my opinion only.   A waitress asked me my opinion about the meal and I was very honest with her.   She understood my concerns being a Senior Citizen.  Price is the only reason I cannot go back.  I understand they have to charge more for bring in Southern Highlands. They could try to offer some better  deals for Seniors and increase the portions a little bit. You should never leave a restaurant hungry.   If you can afford the prices then Bon Apetite",

If you're not in the southern Highlands area, it's worth the drive.  Ambience: this is a smaller restaurant, which gives a great feel for breakfast. The wait staff is in pajamas, which is a nice touch. If you make a trip alone, I recommend sitting at the bar and watching the cooks work. These guys are on top of their game   Food: the portions are big! You definitely get your money's worth. As far as taste, the food is flawless. The pancakes are perfectly fluffy. I had one of the bagel sandwiches and I was thoroughly impressed.  Staff: everyone from the hostess to the manager is very friendly. The waitresses are very attentive and are always around, but not in an annoying bothersome way.   Overall, a great little restaurant. I will be back many times for sure.",

More like Cinnamon toast - you can put butter and jam on it). They have Chilaquilles, which my hubby who loves SW cuisine/flare, was just in love with . The perfect hint of heat, great flavor on his steak - \"Baby, most places just don't season their steaks anymore... this is perfect!\" was the comment that I got, and let me tell you, my hubby is Picky with a capital \"P\"!  definitely recommend going early.

On Monday before taking my mother-in-law to the airport, we stopped in at Rise & Shine and I couldn't resist the baked blueberry French toast casserole.   The hubs and his mom had what appeared to be the regular eggs and bacon breakfast with hash browns but the taters were so tasty and seasoned and the bacon so crisp and smoky!   I stole a piece to go with my blueberry yumminess!  I loved that the blueberry compote wasn't super sweet.  Our server was though and  we can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu offerings.",

A manager from the restaurant contacted me via email and they were truly concerned and apologetic about the service I received. That to me says a lot about the integrity of a business. They truly care not only about delivering a superb product, but making sure that every customers experience is equally as superb! They definitely deserve 5 stars!! The food is excellent and there customer service is top notch and genuine. Anyone who has not eaten there definitely should, they are awesome and deserve your business and it is the best breakfast place in Las Vegas!!",

I have to say that the atmosphere was nice and we were seated very quickly. The waitress took our drink orders immediately and the service started off great. I was vey excited that they served Illy coffee being a huge coffee fanatic but they ruined a terrific bean and rather expensive one by burning it. This is by far the worst cup of Illy i've ever had.  The menu look fantastic and my wife ordered the croissant French toast with blue berries and I had the chicken fried steak. The French toast was nothing like advertised and actually should of been called bread pudding since the consistency was equivalent. The mound of fresh blueberries on top was a nice touch. The wife was not to thrilled about the dish probably because mentally she was prepared for something else, I thought it was just okay. My country fried steak was disappointing , extremely chewy with bits of tendons everywhere, the gravy was good and the hash browns was the best part of the dish. Dont be fooled about the picture of the pot of bread, although it appears fancy, it had no taste and was cold. I will give this place another shot someday but not anytime soon.",

    "text": "We came out on Saturday morning for breakfast.   This was my first time eating here, although I had popped in once about 5 years ago and had a bite of a friend's steak:  it was delicious.  They were busy, but not packed, and we were seated right away. Our server was very sweet, and very patient, as it took us a while to decide on what we wanted to try.    I had the New York Steak, Spinach, and Benedict Bagel which came with potted bread, and my fella had the Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles, also with potted bread. We both had a tea and a coffee as well.   So.  Potted bread.  This was like a sweet, warm cinnamon bun in a little mug served with butter.  You really don't *need* the butter, its that good on its own, but the butter was tasty too.  I'd go back and order just this...a few of them.  They were awesome.   When our breakfasts arrived, I was thrilled with mine.  It looked amazing, and tasted even better!  The steak was cooked to perfection: mid-rare, and seasoned beautifully.  The poached eggs had a lovely runny yolk, and the hollandaise was not too rich.  The spinach gave it a nice touch, and while I didn't really eat all of the bagel, it was delicious, and perfect for sopping up the yolk and juices from the steak.   My fella's Spice rubbed rib eye steak chilaquiles LOOKED amazing.  I, unfortunately, was unable to try any, due to an avocado allergy.  We had asked for them to make it without avocado, but it came out with it on top.  My fella doesn't like avocado, but isn't allergic, so he just scraped it off, and our server apologized about it.  I was bummed that I didn't get to try it, but maybe next time. He really enjoyed it a lot, and the steak was great.  (that was on the side, no avocado!)  Really, the only reasons for the missing star is the avocado, and the fact that for a plain cup of coffee, and a plain bag of Earl Grey tea, it is $2.85 a piece.  That's a little steep for just brewed coffee and a tea bag, if you ask me, especially when we were never offered refills.  Honestly though, its not a huge deal, or a deal breaker, because the food was so delicious, and there was SO much of it!    I have every intention to come back to Rise and Shine for breakfast again.  They have a good sized menu that I look forward to testing out!",

The staff is wonderful, efficient, helpful, and friendly with everyone dressed in their pajamas.  The interior looks lovely, and what really stands out is all the colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling.  The food that I have tried here has been absolutely positively delicious!!  By no means, am I an expert on all their many menu options here.  There are only two meals that I have ever tried here, and I cannot get myself to try some other items.  Crispy Fried Chicken Breast Atop a Waffle is amazing!  The Belgian waffle with the warm cinnamon maple syrup is really good.  The chicken breast that sits on top of that waffle is even better cause it is so tender, moist, and full of flavor!!  Wow!!  Red Velvet Chocolate Chip Pancakes are the BOMB!!!  If you are a sweet tooth like myself, then order this decadent treat!!  It will be like a party in your mouth!!  The combination of the white and milk chocolate chips with the warm cream cheese syrup on top of those fluffy Red Velvet pancakes is like a very very sweet taste of heaven!!!  I can never finish this meal in one sitting because it is so overwhelmingly rich and SWEET!!  Fortunately, the leftovers are almost as good the next day!!  Seriously, get ready for an awesome sugar overload!!  Maybe one day, I will venture to try something else on their menu.  I hear their Steak & eggs are pretty darn incredible as well.  For now, I look forward to my next trip to Sin City so I can get my fill of Rise & Shine's yummy goodness!!",

Our server was Chris and she was really awesome and attentive.... We got our freshly squeezed orange juice, hot chocolate and water within minutes... The menu is huge! So many great breakfast choices to choose from. I felt like I wanted to order a few dishes just for myself but I opted for the bone in ham steak with hash browns, scrambled eggs and a pot of bread (which is my favorite)! My brother got fried chicken and waffles...  Every thing was delicious! I couldn't eat the rest of my ham so I took it home.  Customer Service at Rise n Shine was AWESOME!!! Thank you to our server Chris who was very sweet! I always enjoy coming to this place!",

Her hospitality was just wonderful. Now what really made our experience wonderful was the Hostess CRYSTAL!!! I can say because of her, this will be our location from now on. While waiting for our table, Crystal went the extra mile and made sure we were ok. Crystal constantly kept checking on us to see if we needed anything.  I worked in F&B industry for a long time and never seen someone so happy at her job and so genuine. Crystal definitely made our day, she definitely brightened our stay. She has such powerful smile who seems to love what she does. We will continue coming back definitely and we hope to see Crystal and her wonderful smile!! Every time we come in.",

Usually, I detour when it points me longer than a mile or so, but learning from last time I'm glad we stayed and headed for this place. Had I not I would have ended up at a run down shack in Barstow.   The place looked lively as we came in. After all how many places do you know where you can come to work in your pj's. We all loved this! Made us get even more into the Christmas spirit. We were seated promptly. Not that I'm a coffee connoisseur or anything, but they serve Lavazza! Smooth good ol Italian coffee. Last place I had Lavazza was in San Francisco.   Getting into the menu they had a good variety. I had the steak omelette, and the rest had the chicken and waffles and 3 egg omelette. Overall our breakfast arrived timely, was cooked to order, and I can say their hash browns are outstanding. Only complaint was the chicken had a little too much pepper which ended up brushing off on the waffle. Other than that everything else was good.   In the end it was a great breakfast spot on our way back to CA. I would highly recommend.",

The wait was \"15 min\" when we got there and we weren't seated for 30 min. The hostess was rude, but the waitress was lovely.  Unfortunately the food came out veryyy slowly and the place was not \"packed full\" to support how slow the food came out.  To top off the \"ambiance,\" the restroom was a mess (there was no hand towels or toilet paper.. But that's not the end of the world).  Lastly, there was a lot of tension between all of the employees (especially the hostess and the wait staff). It was very unprofessional, and if I was the owner I would be embarrassed that the negativity is so strong that it bleeds to the customers' experience.  I may order take out from this place some day because again, the food was great, but I do not want to be around the employees.",

The issues started with the waitress scratching her head and then making our toast. Then as I was about to put food in my mouth I cought the cook wipping his nose with the back of his hand and instead of washing his hands, he continued making the food. I was unable to eat and my stomach turned sour. Spoke to the manager and she then decided to tell me they have had this issue with the cook before, that really makes me wonder as to why continue to have this person around.",

When we arrived the place was packed had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table.There was three in our party and we ordered three different things so we could all sample different dishes.  The chicken fried steak is gigantic, enough to share. The breading was awesome. Order extra gravy.  The steak and eggs were delicious not too big or too small. The steak was very flavorful!  The corned beef hash was good. Had better.The corned beef was diced into big pieces prefer it the traditional way.   Wanted to try so many other dishes that sounded great. Will definetly be back!",

Others seemed less thrilled to be there, mentioning to the host that there are other open sections in front of guests creates tension, and when waiting for a long time to be greeted, this really doesn't help. I am thankful the busser grabbed our orange juices, but it was disheartening to see so many walk by and see us still sitting without drinks without checking up on us. I eventually grabbed the busser and asked for drinks. I know we can get tunnel vision in this industry, especially toward the end of the day, but servers are what make or break repeat customers. I really hope that next time this will not be a problem. It really should not take ten minutes to be greeted.",

    "text": "It was my birthday and my boyfriend offered to take me to breakfast. We yelped breakfast places and saw that Rise and Shine had gotten some harsh reviews about service, but the bf had been there before and said he didn't remember poor service being an issue.   We decided to chance it. When we arrived, the hostess (the girl with nose ring) didn't welcome or acknowledge us. We waited and she finally just asked \"how many?\" and then didn't say anything like 'alright just have a seat' or 'it'll be just a minute please' which was awkward.   Great, I thought. My boyfriend even commented about how awkward it was.  But I have to say that was the last of the disappointment because we were seated in about 5 minutes and our server (girl with glasses) was amazing!   She was upbeat and kind and always there to keep our waters and coffees full (they serve Illy coffee which is THE BEST). And she was very attentive without smothering us.   I got the cinnamon toast crunch french toast. It was actually a little burned. But it was still yummy. I ordered it as a platter so it came with sausage and eggs.   Boyfriend ordered corned beef hash and liked it. It came with a pot of bread which really is like a little roll. It's cute but my guy was like \"uhh do I just pull this out and eat it?\" It's nothing too special. It has a cinnamon swirl in the middle which he shared with this birthday girl ;)   We saw the owner, who has been mentioned in previous reviews, running around the restaurant seemingly doing stuff, at least very active, wearing slacks and a dress shirt.   In summary: If the french toast wasn't a little burned it would've been AMAAAZING. Although it was still enjoyable.   Maybe the owner should have a talk w the hostess about how she's the first impression anyone who comes in gets of the establishment.   Order their coffee because Illy is the best!!  Overall, my boyfriend and I felt that it was evident that they read the yelp reviews and make adjustments accordingly. We thought this was great.",
