I ordered the Fairfax sandwich, with added bacon. Boy was it delicious! The eggs were perfectly done, and the Sriracha aoli was on point! I also had one of their famous chocolate chunk cookies with grey salt. Talk about amazing! I would highly recommend this place. One side note - seating is limited. Luckily for me, a table opened up, just after I ordered.",

My girlfriend and I came here and we both got their most popular sandwich which is the Fairfax(eggs,chives, onions,cheddar cheese and Siracha Mayo) I added sausage to mine and my girlfriend added Avocado to hers. Both sandwiches were really good BUT our total for both sandwiches and two 8 ounce OJ came out to $34 and some change. That's really pricey for what you're getting. Overrated! Do your self a favor and go to \"The egg and I\" where you can sit down, have a great meal, take your time and your bill will be $10 less than here.",

I got the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and the chipotle ketchup gave it that extra kick that separates it from your everyday breakfast sandwich.   If you can get over the ridiculously long line (waited almost 40 minutes to order and another 10-15mins for my order) it's worth it.  Not a lot of seating because it more of a carry-out style place and the line is in the hallway next to the ordering counter and was rather hot for some reason, making it a less than an enjoyable wait.   I only gave it 4 starts because of the wait time but it is extremely popular so to be expected. Can't wait to return to Eggslut my next visit to Vegas!",

Some reviewers have cited the lines, but I'm not going to deduct stars for the lines, that is indicative of a good product for me.   We went twice and the first time they were out of the signature dish, the Slut. We both got breakfast sandwiches (Fairfax and Sausage Egg & Cheese) and both were out of this world delicious.  All sandwiches made with brioche buns which are critical to flavor delivery and summarily fantastic.  On second visit, wait was longer, 45 minutes until order, but we lucked out and got Sluts! (It's hit or miss on the sluts, they are cooked sous vide and apparently become available in batches)  The Slut however was worthy of the flagship dish and delivered and made the wait worthwhile.    Also worth trying is the house made biscuit, we also got a side salad on second visit. Both tasty side dishes.  This place is great and worth the wait.",

The menu is simple, basically an assortment of egg sandwiches with a brioche bun and some other options.   The egg sandwiches are always great, this time I opted for the egg salad sandwich, which was very filling. The brioche bun and sauce they add is what makes these egg sandwiches bomb.   Another must try dish is the slut. It is a mushed up potato and poached egg sauce in a bottle. You use toast to dip it in this awesome sauce!

It took about an hour to get to the counter. But we went and got snacks at Momofuku Milk Bar so it was all good.  We ordered a slut and the bacon egg sandwich. The sandwich was good - bacon was ample, bread was soft. But the real star of the show was the slut. So simple yet so good. A coddled egg over mashed potatoes with chives, served with a side of bread.  It was salty, soft delicious awesomeness. The bread could have used more butter but the egg was so good that it kinda didn't matter. My new mission in life is to figure out how to recreate this dish at home since there is no Eggslut in Phoenix.   Get in line. Get a slut. Get happy.",

    "text": "This place gets a solid 3 stars from me, maybe even 3.5.  Marketing is key - so I think this place gets a good portion of it's hype from having 'slut' in the name. People line up to eat here, and maybe because the menu prices are low for breakfast on The Strip.  I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with a scrambled egg. The bacon was delicious, the soft scrambled eggs were definitely cooked soft, and the cheese was good. The chipotle ketchup they put on there is just OK - it tastes out of place on that sandwich. The bun is also a bit much - I'd prefer it on something else. However, I would eat this sandwich again.  My wife got the signature item, the Slut. It's essentially a poached egg on top of \"potato puree\" that's sou-vided in a baby food jar with a few chives sprinkled on top. I saw them running the sou-vide cookers at 142, so, there's the big secret. It's served with some toast, and I guess the way to eat it is to smear some of the egg/potato concoction on top of the toast and chow down. Runny eggs aren't my thing, but for $10.50, this seemed way overhyped and way overpriced.  We also got a biscuit, cold brew coffee and a coke, each of these items were $5. All of this was $41 after a 15% tip. The biscuit was good, but not $5 good.   I am glad I came here as I've been recommended here, but I'd come back and just get a sandwich - the other items are well overpriced. I also wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes or so in line.",

Since we were staying at the Cosmo and on vacation, we really didn't mind the wait as it's only an elevator ride away. (I'd presume if I were staying at another hotel or a Vegas local, the inconvenience may make Eggslut less desirable). This is our first visit and since we weren't planning to come back to Vegas any time soon, the two of us ordered a variety to try out its menu. We ordered the Gaucho (Wagyu tri-tip with over medium egg), Fairfax (scrambled with caramelized onions), Sausage Egg and Cheese added extra bacon (self-explanatory), the Slut (poached egg sitting atop a potato puree), a cookie and orange juice.   The tri-tip wagyu steak on the gaucho was tasty, but an egg-centered sandwich is more suited at Eggslut. I would probably pass in the future especially given its price point.  The Fairfax was the most flavorful and my favorite by far (coming from someone who feels uneasy without meat in a sandwich and hate onions). I would definitely order this again on our next visit.  The sausage egg and cheese was fine, but didn't stand out in any way.   The Slut had a creamy and unique texture (that's what HE said), perfectly blending the poached egg and potato puree with each bite.  The cookie greatly balanced sweet and savory as the sea salt sprinkled over the chocolate chip cookie really brings out another dimension to the flavor profile.  Orange juice is orange juice. No matter how exquisite they make it sound, it's probably not worth $4-5 a cup.  Overall, the line moved fast, food was fantastic, and we enjoyed our meal on the balcony of our hotel room - a very relaxing and delicious start to our morning.",

I will definitely be coming back to try more of their options!",

Fried egg on a spectacular bioche with piles of perfectly crispy bacon and some spicy ketchup stuff: Among the best BEC I have ever had, but still just an egg sandwich.   However, the Fairfax is the one that changed my life forever. I am a different person than I was before that sandwich and I can never go back! It's the most masterfully scrambled egg I have ever experienced and far beyond what I could imagine. It was like air. Or silk. Airy silk? Creamy airy silk. With amazon seasoning and herbs and chives and chipotle aoili or something, and all on that baller brioche. A truly mind blowing eggsperience and worth the 20 minute wait in line!  PS: that fresh orange juice is no joke, you've already waited for infinity to experience peak breakfast perfection, so spring the extra five bucks to wash it down with straight luxury.",

The thing about breakfast sandwiches, usually either the meat or the bun isn't warm but everything was all warm and super tasty and juicy! You could really tell they use good quality homemade ingredients. The \"slut\", oh my goodness. The combination of the smooth potato puree and the perfectly coddled egg smeared over slices of baguette.. It was heavenly! Eggslut is easily one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Can't wait to stop by again!   : 1. SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE: house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun  2. BACON, EGG & CHEESE: hardwood smoked bacon, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun  3. SLUT: cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette",

I stopped by just after 11:00 am on a Saturday morning and a line snaked around the corner and down a connecting a hallway. After about 45 minutes I found myself at the cash register placing my order.  I went with a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a Coke, which ended up being about $11. The sandwich was good, but I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off and I don't think it lived up to the hype.   Just FYI, seating is quite limited. During peak times, which is when I visited, you might not be able to find a table or a place to sit. I ended up walking down the hall a bit until I found a lobby with a table and chairs so I could sit and eat my meal.  In closing, I did enjoy my breakfast, but I don't think I'll stand in line for 45 minutes to not be able to find a place to sit again.  Enjoy at your own risk.",

This eatery located on the second floor of the Cosmo is a perfect addition to the casino's collection of hip and trendy places to nosh. They open really late at night and close up in the afternoon. My friends and I ate here twice on our last visit to Vegas. The first was a late night stop to try the Slut, which is like a poached egg on top of pureed potato in a glass jar. You mix it up and put the resulting spread on slices of toasted baguette. It is heavenly.   On our next visit, which was Sunday morning - the line was hella long. We probably waited in line to order for thirty minutes and then another 15 or so to get our food. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich, which is perfectly cooked scrambled egg and caramelized onions and cheddar cheese with sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. You can add a turkey sausage or avocado for an eggs-tra charge (sorry! Couldn't help it!) I added an avocado. The sandwich was so delicious!!! My friend ordered the egg salad sandwich and that was also super yummy! You can't go wrong with the choices here. They are eggs-perts at what they do (last pun, I promise!).

The menu was small but we got the egg sandwich that was yummy but too much bread and not enough filling. We also got the namesake menu item, the \"Eggslut\" which i thought was going to be something grand and amazing, but was just a cup of mashed potatoes with a poached egg on top. The food tasted good, I was just expecting something overwhelmingly creative and delicious because of all of the things I've heard about it, and due to the price and it being in Vegas.",

Took us about 20 minutes to get the counter which wasn't bad. They take your order quickly and the production staff are busy and they really know how to get the food out to you fast. There is counter seating and plenty of seats out in the mall area. Turnover is quick and you should find a place to sit down somewhere. Food was excellent, hot and delicious. It's not overly priced for Las Vegas and close to the Aria and actually it's in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. A go to place in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "The hype for Eggslut is well well deserved. I will admit that I used to get super annoyed when I would see my IG feed filled with these random ass egg sandwiches and even more annoyed when people would talk about their hour plus waits. Eggslut lovers I was wrong wrong wrong! Yes it's worth the hours wait, yes their eggs and sandwiches live up to the hype, yes to all.   Being in Vegas, you can always expect crowds everywhere and anywhere no matter which weekend you go - this was especially True on the weekend I went which was that of the Billboard Music Awards. Regardless we knew we were going to have to wait to eat, so why not try Eggslut - just to say that we have.   Be forewarned, Eggslut is a tiny establishment. They have very limited seating and even the area to stand in line is quite random - flowing down a dark hallway toward the bathrooms. But again, they serve egg sandwiches so people generally don't take too long to finish their meals and free up seats.   Over the course of two days, I went back three times. No shame, the cashier remembered my name, I'm a bit proud of that. The first time we went was around 11 on Saturday morning and it was quite busy. We waited about 45 minutes in total. When it's crowded, you will be standing in two lines, the first to place your order and the second to pick up your food.   The second two times however, we went after visiting Wicked Spoon at about 2 on a Sunday (no shame here either) and there was absolutely no line. Wait or none, it's worth it.   Everything on their menu (if you couldn't figure out by the name) is centered around eggs. There are various types of sandwiches to choose from but the gist of it - some sort of protein (sausage, turkey sausage or bacon), eggs (over medium or scrambled) with the option of cheese or avocado add on a soft brioche bun.   I was super bummed during my first visit that their special the slut was unavailable so I went with the classic egg sausage and cheese sandwich. Again - I was not expecting much when my order arrived - it looked like a plain ol egg sandwich. I was wrong. The egg was perfectly cooked, with the yolk still running when I bit into the sandwich. The sausage was savory and perfectly seasoned and the brioche was soft. It's sad but I was astounded by how real the food tasted, no fillers no rubberiness.    My second and third visit here they had sluts available and my stomach still smiles when I think about this. The slut is their signature egg dish served in a glass jar. A coddled egg atop the creamiest mashed potatoes you will ever taste with a touch of chives and perfect amount of salt atop.   I can't even begin to explain how freaking amazing it is spread atop of the buttered baguette. The creamy egg and creamy mashed potatoes are delicately flavored with the yolk and salt. Everything just melts in your mouth.   It was pretty cool watching the chefs prepare all of the sandwiches since they have an open kitchen/bar design. You get a front row seat watching them crack and whisk eggs, fry up the bacon and sausages and assemble everything. Guys, they're using real food here and it's sad that it's a big deal when restaurants use real ingredients but that's another story.   On my third visit we had the privilege to chat with the chef and he gave us the 411 on Eggslut. We were super curious about how many eggs they actually go through a day and he said he orders anywhere between 1500 and 1800 a day from a farm in California!! As we gushed about how much we loved the slut he explained how it was made, the mashed potatoes at the bottom are actually the exact recipe as the mashed potatoes at Robuchon. And it is topped with a coddled egg - what is a coddled egg? Well it's quite similar to a poached egg but it never comes into contact with any water, it's cracked on top the potatoes and essentially boiled at a controlled temperature for an hour.   A few things to note: - You want to cut down on carbs, you can substitute the bread for a salad. - If you order the slut to go you get to keep the glass jar!",

I got the cheese, egg, & sausage sandwich while my girlfriend ordered the fairfax sandwich & a slut. My sandwich came out delicious. My girlfriend's fairfax sandwich was perfection, the egg was very fluffy & melted in my mouth. The slut was interesting, egg on the top & mashed potatoes in the bottom, which includes slices of bread.  Overall, I enjoyed my breakfast here, I don't mind coming back here whenever I'm in Vegas",

    "text": "My two favourite places in Vegas sound like some weird stripclubs. Milk and Eggslut. But trust that the name shouldn't deter you from trying this place!  I like eggslut, it's a reliable breakfast, affordable enough and fast service.  There is *always* a ridiculous lineup, but trust that it's not as long as most, these guys are slinging eggs and bacon and that doesn't take much time at all. The sandwiches are a bit more expensive ($6-7 each) than going to McDonalds or something, but you're getting a much more quality meal out of it, and you've probably drank and eaten more than enough in Vegas so far :P. Not to mention this will absolutely be cheaper than room service. Last visit I had a sausage egg and cheese, my husband had a buttermilk biscuit and we shared a coldbrew.  The sausage was savoury, spiced but not overwhelming, often in my experience you get a breakfast sausage patty from most places that is overwhelmingly fennel seed. On a soft, fresh brioche bun with a beautifully cooked, runny yolked egg. Pretty much heaven for me, I'm not that fancy.  Husband enjoyed his biscuit, it was flakey, tender and came with a lot more syrup and butter than you'd want. The cold brew was SO good but OH so small, and very expensive for what it was. Smooth and zero bitterness, but I'd skip this next time and just grab something a little more substantial for my morning java.  The only thing I'd ever want is for them to start serving some form of triangle hashbrown deal, then it'd be perfect!",

Located right on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, this place is pretty easy to see due to the long long line of hungry people.  Made a quick stop here with my mom and we left feeling satisfied. For food, we ordered the Fairfax sandwich (which was a glorified scrambled egg sandwich with onions/chives/siracha sauce), fresh OJ and the dark chocolate cookie.   OJ = fresh and .....orange :)  Cookie = KICK ASS COOKIEEEEEEE. You should try this if it's in stock since they do run out from time to time. Plus, your cookie gets heated up, so the melty chocolate is worth it.  Fairfax Sandwich = yummmmy. Eggs were so fluffy and light as a feather. In terms of taste, it was pretty good, especially the bread. Perfect for sharing if you're not too hungry.   Pricing = priceyyy. It's Vegas....so $20 bucks for a meal wasn't too bad.   Overall, this was a solid stop for breakfast/snack. If you don't see any seats at the nearby counter, don't fret! Just wander around and sit in the comfy lounge seats :D",

This time, the line was about 1.5 hrs long and once again, the food was a disappointment. The bread wasn't warmed up all the way and you can tell because the bread is soft and fluffy around the outside but as it gets towards the middle it was more dry and crumbly.

Their orange juice is freshly squeezed so it was a hit. My favorite was the Fairfax sandwich with bacon. Their spicy chipotle mayo atop the fluffy scrambled eggs made the sandwich delectable. Highly recommended ! Overall I wanted to see what the hype was about. It's overly priced but it lived up to the hype",

But hey -  a first for anything and damn, these are amazing sandwiches!  We ordered two sandwiches:  Fairfax: fluffy delicious scrambled eggs, chives and caramelized onions, with thick slice of ooey gooey cheddar, lathered with sriracha mayo all packed between toasted, soft, amazing brioche buns! Delicious sandwich, we just wish there were more onions!   Sausage, Egg, and Cheese: surprisingly delicious turkey sausage, nicely seared, great seasoning and spice of flavor, soft meat, on top of an over-medium egg which EXPLODED with yolk all over my hands and plate (I LOVE that) oh so sexual I know, a thick slice of cheddar, with honey mustard aioli in that amazingly delicious brioche bun! I should have ordered a biscuit to scoop up the yolk!  Both of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing! Delicious bun, perfectly cooked eggs in each, delicious sausage, lovely sauces to accompany the sandwiches, and overall just a great breakfast!",

So on my first visit, there wasn't a line at all because we came around 3pm I wanna say. This time, it was Sunday noonish and the line wrapped around the corner and down the hall.   I tried the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on my first visit. They put this chipotle ketchup on it which really made the sandwich excellent. And I can't say that they weren't generous with the bacon. (5/5)  On my second visit, I tried the turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and this was not nearly as good as the bacon one. The flavors weren't really there for me. The turkey sausage was a lot better than I anticipated but I just had high expectations after having the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. (3/5)  My friend order the slut because it seemed to be popular and one of their specialties. I have to say we were really disappointed. I was underwhelmed with my initial bite. First of all, it is overpriced ($10) for a little jar and a few pieces of toast. It basically tasted like watered down mashed potatoes. Not worth the money. It isn't that great in my opinion.   Drinks here are incredibly expensive too (probably to pay for the rent since it's inside the Cosmo) so BYOB... A small bottle of Smartwater here is $4.",

The Fairfax is my favorite and the warm brioche bun is filled with soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. I've also tried the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich which comes with chipotle ketchup. My man loved his sausage, egg & cheese sandwich and let's not forget about the most interesting item on the menu, the slut. A coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with baguette slices. Talk about making breakfast extra sexy!  If you love eggs this place is for you as the star ingredient is the egg. This place isn't cheap but once you taste it you'll understand why.   Things to consider ~  This place is popular so sometimes the wait can be long. Not a lot of seating so don't be surprised if you can't find a spot by the time your meal is made (easy solution - keep walking & you'll find plenty of open seating all around the Cosmo where you can sit down and enjoy your food).",

I'm from LA so my only reference of the restaurant was the Grand Central Market location, and I always avoid it because the line is long.   The line was long here too, but it seemed to go by pretty quickly. I also ordered the Fairfax burger but I legit ate it so quickly that I couldn't even snap a picture! It was honestly so good. It was perfect the way you imagine the perfect boy. It checked off all the requirements. It was soft and juicy and cheesy and the eggs . It was amazing. I want another.   Again, I ate that burger so quick, I didn't even give myself a chance to post it on any social media platforms. It didn't make it to snapchat, it didn't make it to Instagram stories. It made it straight to my mouth. Go to eggslut, every chance you can.",

I got the bacon, fried egg and cheese sandwich. The bun wasn't as good as I hoped for as it was a little dry. I think if they put it on sourdough bread I would have liked it more. The menu is quite small but there's other sandwiches such as an egg salad sandwich, sausage and egg, or burger. My mom had the burger and said it was good but she agreed that the bread wasn't that great.   You'll surely make a mess when eating this sandwich because the egg is quite runny. Be careful not to spill yolk on your clothes! Lol. There's some seating located in the restaurant but not much. Glad I tried this place but not 100% sure I'd crave it enough to go back.",

The brioche bun is always fresh, the onions perfectly carmelized. I usually forgo the sriracha mayo, but still find the sandwich quite tasty.  It's the strip, and it's Cosmo.

Open kitchen style restaurant were you walk up to the counter, place your order and wait to have your name called. Minimal seating inside the restaurant but plenty of places to sit outside the restaurant.   Food wise everything tasted mediocre. Food temp was \"warm\" at best. Ordered the biscuit and the outside was luke warm but the center was cold. Everything else was an okay temp. I'm one to not care if my food isn't piping hot, but you literally see them cooking it in front of you so i don't understand why the sandwiches still came out just luke warm. Overall experience was underwhelming. Probably won't go back to this location but would try their LA location out.",

The egg slut is a soft boiled egg on top of potatoes in a glass jar with several slices of bread. For $10.50, it definitely is very overpriced for what you get. The Fairfax was $8.50, and came on a brioche bun with egg and cheese, with the option to add bacon or avocado for a few dollars more.   And if you don't want to wait, right next door you can get an awesome biscuit sandwich with cheese and egg and bacon (which I liked better than eggslut) all for for six dollars and ZERO wait at District.",

    "text": "For as long as I could remember, I've had Eggslut bookmarked at the top of my \"must-try\" eateries. Just seeing pictures of fried eggs oozing out yolk made me salivate with longing and desire. But because I lived five hours away in the Bay Area, I hadn't had a chance to visit their Los Angeles location.  But recently, during a quick trip to Vegas with my girlfriend, I FINALLY checked this off my bucket list. We made sure to visit Eggslut, rain or shine. It was inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, one of the classiest casinos on the strip, and we stopped by during the second day of our adventure.   It seemed like the hype truly found its way to Sin City because we found ourselves stuck behind a HUGE LINE. And this was at like 10am mind you. Luckily, it probably only took about a half hour for us to reach the front.   True to the name, Eggslut is all about the eggs. Here, they served six different kinds of delectable sandwiches along with two special items and sides. The really cool thing about this place was that each of their items were very unique. For example, they had a wagyu burger! In terms of cost, most options were a shade under $10 - kinda pricey considering a breakfast sandwich but as I'll describe below, it was SO WORTH!  We ended up sharing their Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich. After eagerly waiting about 15 or so more minutes for our food to come out, we finally dug in. Omg, maybe I should've drove to SoCal just for this because the sandwich was AMAZEBALLS! Portion size was decent, cheese was plentiful, and bacon was VERY crunchy! I thought the brioche was a good choice for bread, and the chipotle ketchup sauce made it all come together. Of course, the egg was cooked perfectly - a little runny yet fried well - but I did wish that they gave us more. I felt like the egg was an afterthought whereas the bacon was the star. It should've been the other way around! Overall, definitely 9/10.   As an additional note, probably one of the other highlights of our visit was the genuine professionalism. All the staff members, despite the rush, were so amicable. They made sure every customer was taken care of equally.   Only a few things can make me dirty and Eggslut was one of them. I loved their sandwich and totally didn't regret waiting a long time in line for this experience. I can't wait to check out their LA locations. I give Eggslut an \"Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating.  Eat well and prosper,",

I added bacon to my sandwich.   My only complaint of the food was the brioche bun. It was tasty but would be more appropriate for a burger. For this sandwich I felt it needed something more hearty, like maybe a baguette or toasted sourdough, as all my innards fell out of the soft bun and I had to eat it with a fork.   I also got the fresh squeezed OJ which was amazing but a little pricey at $5 for a small glass. My boyfriend ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and said it was good but wasn't a fan of the ketchup that came on it.  Our wait wasn't terrible and the line, although long, moved quickly.  The only reason I didn't give five stars was for the portions. It was a smaller sandwich that didn't come with any sides and my boyfriend and I were both hungry again about an hour later. For over $30 for breakfast for two that consisted of 2 sandwiches and one OJ I would have hoped to be full for a good long while.  TL:DR amazing food but small portions.",

Luckily it's a fast paced breakfast place that people are constantly getting up and leaving just have to be on the lookout for a table/ empty chair. I highly recommend getting the orange juice! So fresh and so yummy!  Their pricing is actually decent, between $6-10 for a delicious breakfast sandwich",

    "text": "besides the fact that this is not NYC where people stand in lines to stand in lines, I was like why must there be a line in the Cosmo for an egg sandwich. Granted not just your regular old egg sandwich, but still c'mon folks.   Sometimes these foodie trends make me giggle, and nonetheless, I find myself entertaining to them as well. Because I did stand in line and I ordered my sandwich and I very much enjoyed it! Its always crazy busy guys so just accept that you'll have a line to wait in, so don't come \"hangry\" or \"shit-faced\" cause you won't like the wait.   So ES itself bomb, 8/10 would recommend and that's a generous compliment. It was a bunch of us so we ordered a variety of different things on the menu. The slut seemed to be a popular favorite, and I must say I tried some and having potato puree in a jar is just not my jam. I wouldn't even do potato puree on a regular breakfast day soooooo...to each their own. The Fairfax and the Egg Salad though, yes please all day every day. I mean no, I wouldn't go out of my way for ES every time but it was bomb I can't deny that.  Here's my thing, I do love Eggslut and I do enjoy their menu but I just feel like I've made better and had better breakfast sandwiches in my life for a lot cheaper so here we are in this hype ass world where everything is just based on how popular it is and I'm like meeehh it was okay.",

I was extremely let down by the runny consistency of my sandwich. The buns were extremely lite and fluffy, and they could have added more consistency to the runny sandwich, but it didn't.   Overall: 3/10. Very disappointing, hyped up, and over priced. ($50 for 2 people!) I'd suggest checking out the Lardo grill in the cosmo or finding another brunch spot that doesn't come with all the drama and fake hype :)",

I could do without the slather of the butter on top of the bun because it's literally on every square inch of the bun from inside and out.  So the sandwich is greasy and delicious at the same time.   A small freshly squeezed orange juice is $5.   I wish they had late night hours, but they close around 7pm I think.  Location: 2nd floor of Cosmopolitan",

    "text": "Pretty much the same thing as the original in LA, which until this point was the only location I had tried. If you like a modern and updated spin on breakfast staples, this is the place for you. Unlike multiple visits to the DTLA locale, I did not have to wait for an hour for food and the line moves very quickly between the hours of 7-9 am (stood there 15 mins maybe? food came out in 5). Much easier to try this popular chain at the Cosmo compared to LA.   The slut is arguably the most popular dish, and while I do like it, my favorite is the fairfax sandwich (add avocado and bacon of course). The light whipped texure of the egg is divine, I have not been able to replicate this at home. The brioche is nice and soft, and fresh squeezed orange juice is a nice addition to the meal.   Come at the right time to avoid a wait and you'll be happy with your meal. It's not the holy grail of breakfast but it's very good for what it is. Worth trying for sure, worth the hype up to a certain extent.",

Make the time to stop here if you want a delicious breakfast sandwich. I got the bacon egg and NO cheese. The bacon was thick and crispy. I would have preferred to have one more slice of bacon. The egg was cooked just right! Just enough that the yolk wasn't all the way cooked but didn't make a big mess when I took my first bite. The sandwich comes in a nice paper wrap so your hands don't get dirty if you need to eat on the go. They gave me napkins in my to go bag. I'd say I  waited about twenty minutes all and all. Not bad!",

Ordered two Gauchos, a bacon egg & cheese, a beer, and an orange juice. Total before tax and tip $55. The Gaucho alone is $15.65. For a wagyu tri tip sandwich, the Gaucho experience was underwhelming. If I had a do over, I'd get the basic egg sandwich. And I can't see waiting in line 45 minutes. Eggslut is very trendy (like a fashion accessory). Go once to say you've been. Otherwise there are better values inside the Cosmo.",

Downtown LA location had a long wait, but was still delicious. Because of this, I had the same expectations for the Venice Beach location. However, that one was a huge letdown (yolk was already popped before it got served to me and meat wasn't seasoned).    But when I found out my hotel (The Cosmopolitan) has an Eggslut, I wanted to give them another chance. Needless to say, this was the best one by far!   My girlfriend and I ordered two cheeseburgers and a slut (first time trying and definitely won't be the last!)    Meat was seasoned well, the brioche buns were just crispy enough to have a slight crunch, but the insides were warm and soft. Cheese was melted just right, and the egg was perfectly cooked (popped right in the middle of the burger. So delicious).   Slut was warm and poached well, and the mashed potato under was seasoned nicely and soft.   Line wasn't long, but I think it's because I came here during off-season on a Tuesday. But workers were very efficient, so that was nice to see!   And lastly, the location. It was downstairs of my room (got off the elevator, turned right, and it was right there) which was super convenient.   Overall, this was the best Eggslut experience for me.",

The Gaucho Sandwich $15 was amazzzing with its wagyu tri tip steak and chimichuri sauce.  I would definitely order this again even though it's crazy expensive for just a sandwich.    The Slut $10.50 on the other hand tasted like mash potatoes .  I did not care for this at all.   For 2 sandwiches and a slut, I paid $37.  Pretty expensive but worth trying if you have not had it before AND if there is no wait.  Otherwise save the experience for another day.",

    "text": "Eggslut lets me be proud of my inner dirty slut at brunch time and for that, bravo.  I'm unwilling to say this will be the best breakfast sandwich you will ever have in your life. I am willing to say it's a good one on the Vegas strip. I'm also willing to say you will wait in line for it. I got the sausage (subbed in the siricha mayo). It's drippy, meaty, saucy goodness. I'd ask for extra mayo because that's the only way to live your best life.  I'm shocked to say this, but I'd actually recommend the Slut which is a coddled egg (BTW, I have no slutty idea what a coddled egg is but I'm fairly certain the dude I met last night wanted to try that move on me). Break the yolk, mix, and lather on bread. It's buttery, rich, and delicious.  Ps, went with two friends/coworkers who wanted a shout out. Hi Matt and Scott.",

The eggs are cooked perfectly and the branding is almost as awesome as the food itself.  You will wait in line and I don't know if it's worth it because that's a personal question you have to ask yourself--how long would you wait in line for a fast-casual egg sandwich? It sounds like a lot of suckers on Yelp don't believe the hype as much has I do, but I also love fast-casual and egg sandwiches.  The coffee is delicious but expensive. I was initially upset that I bought such an expensive iced coffee until they told me that I could get a free refill.  My favorite places are these places.",

Even though the queue went round the corner, I only had to wait 15 minutes to be served.  I ordered the slut and my friend had the fairfax sandwich.  Both came out in about 15 minutes. Whilst I liked the slut (coddled egg on mash potato), I found the portion size small, and I normally eat the least out of everyone I dine with. I actually had to go and get another meal.  I tried again on another night and tried the fairfax sandwich, which was much more filling and super delicious.  All in all, the egg is delicious and I think worth the hype, but just note that the portions are a little smaller so you may need to order sides if you are going for a meal, or just go for a snack.",

My husband and I stopped by on Saturday morning around 8AM and there was already a huge line. We waited about 45 minutes before we finally got to the counter to order. We ordered the slut, bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and the buttermilk biscuit. The food came out pretty quickly and seating was not an issue for us. The slut was the best part of my meal. They serve it in a little mason jar. The server told us to break the runny yolk and mix it with the pureed mashed potatoes and dip the baguette into the mixture. A 'one of a kind' type of food. The breakfast sandwich was also very tasty. What made the sandwich even better was the chipotle ketchup that they put on it. I could have done without the buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was super dense, hard, cold and fell apart just after one bite. Will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas or SoCal.",

It was more of a snack breakfast place. My boyfriend had and egg sandwich which he wasn't impressed with either. $5 dollars for orange juice is absolutely ridiculous. And for a $30 dollar meal you should at least feel satisfied after. I'm genuinely surprised most people love it so much... it's honestly nothing I couldn't make at home. Maybe I'm just spoiled with the food that I work with at my job but I was definitely not impressed what so ever. There was no sides besides salad... for breakfast?? No thanks.

Starting with the beef sandwich or Gaucho, the Fairfax and finally, the Slut. I honestly do cringe a little every time I actually say the name of the diner but I suppose this is all part of the image. Fun fact: the term eggslut was apparently used initially to describe chefs who cooked eggs all the time (I wanted to understand better how they came up with the name). I'm pretty sure we visited this place 3 times in the 4/5 days we were in Vegas. Another thing I loved about this place was that you can watch your food being cooked up right in front of you. The size of the place is small with limited seating is but reminiscent of its original food truck beginnings. Thanks for satisfying our egg-related urges!",

The wagyu was super tender, the egg was perfectly done, and the chimichurri complimented it all. I'm hooked. But only giving 4 stars because they were out of the coddled egg over potato puree in a jar- and that's why we stood in line for 20 minutes to begin with.",

It didn't quite take as long as I thought, I probably only waited about 20 minutes in line and then when I placed my order it was super quick to receive.  I ordered a sausage egg and cheese with bacon and really enjoyed it. I'm not sure where this place gets their meat but the sausage was super juicy and the bacon was perfectly salty, crunchy and smoky. I love that this place took me by surprise,  will definitely recommend to friends.",

My boyfriend probably paid around $30 from what I recall for 2 people. For that price I'd much rather prefer a sit down brunch restaurant, which we'd probably pay for cheaper. But I mean you get what you get for a food specialty place especially located on the strip. This place was good, nothing out of this world. Overhyped? Very. But Being a vegas local I didnt expect anymore or any less. Probably wouldn't go back unless a good friend of family is in town and staying at cosmo. That is the only occasion I would come here again. I could make this at home now that I think of it, probably going to rn.",

Still just eggs with mashed. So that was disappointing. Thank god I got the breakfast sammy as well. For a first timer, its definitely worth trying. But i dont think I will be a repeater.",

Couldn't find parking for the longest in the Cosmopolitan. Walked up to where Egg slut was located and it wasn't that packed. Line wasn't long and I was able to ordered within minutes. Ordered the Gaucho but they were out. Ended up ordering the Fairfax with bacon added. The Fairfax with added bacon ended up to be $11.90. Only took a few minutes for the sandwich to come out. As I bit into the sandwich; I wasn't really amazed. It tasted just like an egg sandwich, however once all the flavors come in, it was savory with a little kick from the siracha mayo. My friend ordered the slut. It was okay as well. Basically it tasted like watery mashed potatoes with egg on top. The presentation/ idea is cute and catches your eye. The ice coffee had absolutely NO taste whatsoever. Would I come again? 50/50 maybe. I would come back to try the Guacho but other than that it's not worth fighting the strip traffic and going through a casino. But it's definitely worth trying once just to say yes, I've been there!",

It reached to the back of the long corridor next to Eggslut. However, the wait went by quick, only about 20 minutes until I reached the cashier.  The Slut (10): I had to get this just for its name! Inside a tiny glass jar you get potato puree topped with poached-like egg and chives. You also get three slices of baguettes. It was so satisfying mixing everything in the jar. The end result tastes like delicious, very creamy smooth mashed potatoes! I think the price for this dish is a little steep...maybe you're paying for that glass jar? I don't know about you but I kept it!  The Fairfax (8): The perfect egg sandwich! Inside the well-buttered brioche bun, there are scrambled eggs, chives, cheese, onions, and sriracha mayo! This really hit the spot that I freaking inhaled it! I loved how fluffy my eggs were.  Eggslut has an exposed kitchen and you just see the hundreds of eggs they're cooking up, pretty cool! There's also very few seating, but no worries we just brought it back to our room. I can see how this can be so delicious after a night of clubbing too!",

I don't eat meat and they made a fuss about taking the bacon off the egg and cheese sandwich. My egg was so runny I couldn't bite into it without it oozing everywhere (sorry for the visual there). I wouldn't go out of my way to ever come back here.  Location: 2nd floor of the Cosmo",

Whether you're trying to shove something down while you're hungover, or just totally innocently looking for a good breakfast sandwich that is portable and reasonably priced, Eggslut doesn't disappoint. You get exactly what is advertised. My boyfriend and I ordered the original sandwiches with bacon, egg, and cheese. The bun is chewy (in a good way), the bacon is crispy, the cheese gooey, and the egg fluffy. I'm honestly starting to salivate a little just thinking about it (I love breakfast food)... Their orange juice hits the spot if you're thirsty for some vitamin c, but it's nothing special. This is another place my boyfriend wanted to visit multiple times during our visit, though we couldn't. However, it's the thought that counts!",

I've heard of waits as long as 1-2 hours, which is astounding.  Furthermore, as a fast food place I'm not sure how they have the gall to ask for gratuity.  There is no service to speak of, no seating, and because they're trying to sell you $4 bottles of Smart Water, I was told \"we don't have water\" when I asked.  Really?  So they don't wash dishes either?  Honestly, McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts do breakfast sandwiches nearly as good, for about half the price.  And included with those experiences is a cup of coffee, hash browns, and decent customer service without shamelessly asking for tips.  I'd opt to go there next time.",

They're located in the Cosmopolitan on the second floor right across from Marquee.  I came around 11am on a Saturday and the line was a 25~ minute wait to order. I got the Fairfax Sandwich ($8) and it was pretty good. It was served on a warm brioche bun and filled with scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo. These ingredients transpired into a delicious breakfast sandwich. Add-ons include: bacon ($4), turkey sausage ($4), and avocado ($2). The avocado was tempting but I restrained after seeing the price, quite expensive...  Portion wise, it's a bit small so if you're very hungry, it will not be a satisfying meal. However, if you're looking for something light in preparation for a buffet or something later on in the evening, Eggslut is a great option for a brunch snack.",

It took about 25 minutes to get through the line and order and we got excited for the food. But then we waited another 20-25 minutes to receive our order. It takes way too long to make such a simple sandwich!   People rave about Eggslut, but I think it's overrated. I guess it's kind of cool to watch them cook, but I just got more hungry.   I ordered a sausage and egg sandwich but it was alright, nothing super spectacular in my opinion. My sister ordered the eggslut (coddled egg in a jar), that was more interesting and unique. It was tasty too. Her order came out faster than mine although I ordered first. I waited ten more minutes for my food, that's ridiculous.   I'll most likely opt to try other places for breakfast the next time I'm in town. Good to try one time, not worth the long wait. If it were faster, that'd be better.",

Thankfully a table opened as soon as we walked up and I grabbed it because lack of tables here is a given.  I was pleasantly surprised with their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. Not oily and the bread was warm and soft. The egg was cooked to perfection. A little yolky just how I like it. The eggslut was very tasty. The potatoes at the bottom were my favorite! I'd prefer a softer piece of bread with it but the toasted slice was good too. If I were to come back, I would not wait as long as we did the first time. Good, but not worth the 25-30 minute wait.

Patrick, the manager, allowed this and said it was fine because they \"called ahead,\" yet still placed their order on the spot. It was incredibly disrespectful to all of us who had been waiting in line that these guys somehow got preferential treatment. I will not be coming back.  And my sandwich was only okay.",

I recommend the egg & bacon because of their thickly cut bacon that's seals the sandwich altogether tbh & the fairfax comes with a very fluffy and tasty/sweet scramble!!!

    "text": "I'd visited the original Eggslut in LA's Grand Central Market on a few different occasions, and found it bland and overrated every single time.  When a friend insisted we visit its latest incarnation in the Cosmo, I was skeptical.  Turns out my skepticism was justified.  The food is essentially identical to what's served at the LA occasion, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  After a long-ish (30 min) wait to order on a Thursday morning, I quickly received my egg salad sandwich and took a seat at the neighboring Chandelier bar to chow down.  Unfortunately, the sandwich was decidedly average.  My gripe with Eggslut food transcends all of the locations, and it's the blandness.  The egg salad sandwich was undoubtedly fresh and high-quality, but it tasted like nothing.  Any seasoning at all would've made the sandwich better.  Some salt, maybe?  A little pepper?  Maybe go crazy and add some heat or acidity?  I realize the goal is to make the eggs the star, but eggs are pretty basic, flavor-wise.  They need seasoning, and they need it desperately.  I also had a cold brew coffee.  It was very good and strong -- markedly better than the cold brews at most of the casino cafes.  But the cold brew couldn't rescue the experience.  Until Eggslut starts giving its food some flavor, I doubt I'll be back.",

Want a small cup of OJ?  $5.  A bottle of Coca-Cola?  $5.  A cup of coffee?  $4.50-$5.  The markup on this stuff is insulting.  Also, there is one... ONE table.  16 chairs on one long bi-level table.  On our visit the entire table was taken over by one single family and two couples.  We had to eat our food standing in the hallway.  That is completely unacceptable.  The sandwiches are good.  Pretty much everything else at Egg Slut is pure crud.",

I got the egg salad sandwich and added bacon to it! The extra surcharge was completely worth it. Plus, I was full for hours and didn't feel hungry again until dinner (which is always a 'plus' in Vegas with how expensive everything is).

I ordered the sausage sandwich with honey mustard aioli, and it was really not so great. I would much rather hit up McDonald's for one of their classic breakfast sandwiches than come back here.

We had seen their LA location in the Grand Central Market, but the wait there was probably even more crazy! With nothing specific on the agenda for our morning in Vegas, we decided to take the plunge.  For our first trip, we decided to stick with the sandwiches. The breakfast sandwich is a staple of morning life back home in NY, so we always jump at the chance to get a good one. Paired with their fresh orange juice, it made for a tasty breakfast.  Be aware that the food is a little bit pricey for what is essentially \"fast food\" (although it is Vegas!). And the egg sandwiches can be VERY drippy. We didn't realize what we were getting into until the table and our hands were drenched in egg. It definitely helps the sandwich avoid being too dry, but it can also be a bit sloppy.",

People that ordered after us were getting their food before us. And there were some that seemed like they had been waiting far longer than we did. They definitely need to work with that because while our sandwich was good, I don't think I would have waited the 45-50 minutes.   We both got the Fairfax with bacon added. That really was good. This would have gotten 5 stars but they really need to work on efficiency.   The scrambled eggs were perfectly creamy and the bacon seemed like a good quality. And the bun. Holy cow. I was a little hesitant to see essentially a hamburger bun as the main bread, but wow was that amazing. The spicy mayo was the perfect touch at the end. The Fairfax was supposed to have caramelized onions on it, and neither of ours did. Can't say I missed it but would have been nice to try it with the completed recipe.  Not a huge deal.   Definitely would eat again if they work on kitchen efficiency.",

The food here is amazing. They have the same menu lineup, prices, food quality, and the wait line is similar to LA.   I highly recommend the Fairfax with bacon. Brioche and eggs melt in your mouth while the bacon has a good crunch.   Anyway, off my rant. If you don't want to pay \"high\" prices and wait, go to mcdonalds. Stop complaining and enjoy the food.",

Not sure I'd wait in a long line for this food. Ingredients were fresh and good quality. The Fairfax (soft-scrambled egg with caramelized onion, and cheddar on brioche) with added bacon, was a nice, hearty sandwich. A bit too much sriracha mayo on it for me, though. I had an odd experience with the Slut (poached egg over potato puree in a jar with chive and sea salt, served with toast). I really did not like the first bite...but I kept eating, and the more bites I had, the more I liked it. Lol. After eating it, I decided I liked it more than the Fairfax. Go figure. We also got a salted chocolate cookie. It was good, but seemed expensive at $4.50.  Counter service. Limited seating.  Overall, a good place to get an egg sandwich if the line isn't too long. Expect Vegas hotel prices (like $8 for the Fairfax sandwich, $11 if you add bacon). I would go back to try their other sandwiches. A-OK.",

SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS A 50+ PERSON LINE! and it does not move quickly. But as the well-traveled lady on my flight remarked: \"I never go to Las Vegas without 2 or 3 meals at Eggslut\".

Location: I'm a morning person and I usually have a meal early in the day so having an Eggslut at the hotel you're staying at was convenient but Eggslut was also a cheap and good enough start meal for mornings and the portions aren't too enormous like the other breakfast joints. It's also in the same floor as the Standard Juice bar if you want a healthier beverage with your egg dish.   Cons  Bacon, Egg, n Cheese Sandwich: The toppings were fine but the brioche bun they used was extremely dry and brittle. I went during the early morning and late night and there was no difference, it was a dry and tasteless bun regardless of the time of day you go.",

    "text": "Love Eggslut!! It's such a simple concept, but the outcome is so delicious. Located in the Cosmopolitan, up the escalator (near Milk Bar). The place didn't seem too crowded when I went around mid-afternoon on Sunday. Probably your best bet to try this place, since the LA location is ALWAYS packed.  My favorite is the Fairfax Sandwich (vegetarian friendly!). it comes packed with scrambled eggs, caramelized onions, cheese and their yummy sriracha mayo sauce. Be sure to keep it wrapped while eating because the egg will most definitely escape from the bottom and sides as you bite through it. The brioche bread is also very light--tastes so much better than regular breads!  Overall, this is a great place for a bite to eat for either breakfast, lunch, or drunchies. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches!",

The guys who were working were all great & and the food was delicious, I was in a line with about 20 people and my food was ready within 5 minutes which I think is a great turn around. There wasn't many places to sit, but that's not anyone's fault it was the small space they are given. We all just sat on the couches that are right in front.  My girl told me the \"slut\" was a little salty. But I got the fair fax and it's always made to perfection.",

Presentation was sub-par, flavor was bland (tasted the same as a gas station egg salad), and I definitely ate a couple egg shells that were hidden in my egg salad. And there's nothing special about the buns it came with, tasted the same as grocery store buns.  Would not come back again, nor would I go to the LA location near where I live. At that price and experience, I'd rather make my own egg salad at a fraction of the cost, better taste, and better value.",

It is like mash potatoes and eggs runny style, just the way I like and the taste is pure blissfull goodness!   I have to admit i was expecting it to be all hype and no good but boy was I completely wrong. I am definitely going to have to get up early enough to catch the one in LA, this is a must!

Unfortunately, we fell for all the advertisements around the hotel marketing Eggslut and didn't bother to check the reviews before eating there.  Quality:   We both ordered the Slut which was an egg on top of potato puree served in a glass with salt garnished with chives. I didn't expect the egg to be so runny, but what I didn't like was the watery potato puree I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker.   I also ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with chimichurri sauce with I thought was quite better in flavor than the Slut. I did like the chimichurri sauce and tri-tip but felt that there was something missing from the sandwich.  To finish it off we got a chocolate chip cookie but it was too heavy on the sea salt that we couldn't eat it.   I would recommend the tri-tip over Slut.   Service:  Although there was a long line I expected our order to come out a bit faster. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out. I saw other guest who were behind us in line receive their order before ours even parties that were more then two people.  Overall:  Disappointed in all the hype and attention Eggslut has and will not being going there again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Menu is pretty to the point just be aware it's only the food there is not meal options aka it doesn't come with a side or a drink. And all the drink options were like $5 extra. OJ? $5. A bottle of water? $5. So fuck that noise just get the food. The cheeseburger and the bacon egg and cheese sandwiches were bomb and filling and at a decent price. Also service was pretty fast turn around. So check this place out if you're hungry for some breakfast type food!",

The atmosphere is nice and the gentleman that took our order was very informative.   I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. I really liked that the menu said the bread was made locally and delivered daily. With seeing the other reviews I knew I was in for a great sandwich (simple but still very tasty) I had to order a side of the sriracha mayo just Incase I needed some spice. And while it didn't relay need it I just always have to have a hint of spice for more flavor.   Now the presentation was spot on. It was so nice to see how much effort they put into making these tasty sandwiches. Way to go staff. I also had to take a video of the hard working egg chef   Lastly, I thought it would be helpful to give tourist to Vegas (like myself) a helpful tip. This place is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. It was driving me crazy where this place was. Maybe I didn't read anyone else's helpful tip (hungry) but I found it and thought I would pass the info. So if it helps let me know.",

    "text": "This is my second time eating at Eggslut, my previous time being at their NYC popup. I think that Eggslut does a solid job with their breakfast sandwiches and they definitely have a great variety of choices for all palates.   But man is it expensive.   I had the Gaucho this time around, which came out to be around $15-$16. Now I realize that part of the reason it's so pricey is due to the Wagyu that is inside the sandwich, but I was also pretty disappointed with how tough and chewy the meat was. Wagyu beef is an exceptional cut of meat, but the Gaucho didn't seem to do it the justice it deserved. I don't think it was just my sandwich either, as my friend who also ordered the Gaucho expressed a similar sentiment. I actually think that their regular sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich may have been a better choice, despite being a little more boring description-wise. One positive to note is that they can make your egg differently if you prefer something other than medium, such as scrambled.   Line in the morning was long but moved pretty quickly. It wrapped around the corner but it only took about 10-15 minutes until we were in front of the cashier.   Overall, I feel like Eggslut's hype and name brand play a significant factor in its popularity, but they are able to back it up with some good breakfast options. However, do expect to pay a premium for it, a price that may be difficult for a breakfast sandwich to live up to.",

This was my first visit to the Vegas location, but the menu is the same and just as delicious as the LA location. My friend and I shared the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich which sounds super basic but it's not. Eggslut does extra magic to their food. The breakfast sandwich is made with applewood smoked bacon, a cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun. All the elements combined = a party for my taste buds. The bacon, so crispy and salty. The bun, soft and fluffy. But the real magic is the egg, when the yolk breaks and combined all those flavors and textures. Eggslut, you have my heart/stomach.   This location gets busy and there will be a wait to order. It'll be worth it.",

So worth the wait and the overall 45-50 minutes to go over to Cosmopolitan and bring this back to Bellagio. I got the Fairfax with added turkey sausage, cookie, and coffee. It was tough deciding because each sandwich has its advantages. The flavor and level of sinfulness are divine. Without being too hyperbolic this is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had, and it's nuts they can make this this good in this kind of setting (fast food ish) - it is better than 90% of sit down brunch sandwiches. I go to California much more than LV but I am never over where these are. It's definitely worth making it out to one.",

    "text": "My husband and I had our first meal in Las Vegas at the Eggslut, as we're staying at The Cosmopolitan for the next few days, and I must admit to being disappointed by their breakfast. We ordered two egg sandwiches (the Fairfax and the Egg Salad) and while both were good, they weren't worth the high prices or the 30 minutes we had to wait at 8:30 in the morning. If you need to wait that long for a couple of sandwiches, they should be exceptional -- and the sandwiches at Eggslut just don't hit the mark for me. The food is good but nothing different from what you could get at a decent neighborhood joint in New York (or, I'm assuming, Las Vegas).  The brioche buns in particular were kind of greasy and overly large. I wish they gave us the option of getting our food on a croissant instead -- I think it would have paired better with the egg, which was well cooked. I would have also liked a more melted slice of cheese -- ours was not all that hot or gooey, even fresh off the grill. I know the kitchen staff was incredibly busy servicing the many people who showed up... but I felt as though the sandwiches just didn't add in the right finishing touches to make them incredible. A competent home chef could have done a better job with the ingredients they had.  The salted chocolate chip cookie was, however, extremely delicious -- freshly baked and oozing with warm chocolate chips. I'm not sure if they'd still be as good later in the day but I suggest you get one early in the morning.   Service was also fast and friendly -- no complaints there. But keep in mind that they automatically add 15% gratuity when they charge you so if you don't want to pay so much for tip, you'll need to lower that tab yourself! (I paid $2 in gratuity myself. The staff seemed great but I don't see why I need to pay 15% in tip when I'm basically just ordering and then taking food to go).",

Luckily, one of my colleagues had gotten there earlier and reserved some spots in line so I only had to wait less than 10 minutes to get my order in. I decided to go with the slut due to the namesake of this restaurant and I was not disappointed. The potato puree with the coddled egg on top made for the perfect combo, especially when paired with the crostinis on the side. It had just the right amount of carbs to get your day started off right without loading you down. There isn't a ton of seating but people tend to eat and go so everything clears up pretty quick.",

    "text": "I'm just gonna say it, even though I know it's the unpopular opinion -- runny egg yolk porn just isn't as sexy as fluffy, jiggly soft-scrambled eggs. Eggspecially eggcellent is Eggslut's Fairfax sandwich's impossibly light, cloud-like scrambled eggs speckled with chives, caramelized onions, cheddar, & what I wish there was more of -- sriracha mayo -- on a buttery brioche bun. Add bacon (like I did) or turkey sausage for a couple bucks.   My companions also enjoyed their sandwiches. The patty in his Cheeseburger was thin but big on beef flavor. Thumbs up for her Gaucho Sandwich, made with wagyu tri tip & chimichurri.   The original Los Angeles location has caused quite a buzz & amassed a hell of a following, which explains why the line at Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel was longer than the line for their trendy dayclub, Marquee.",

The scrambled eggs on top were a bit wet still and without the bacon the sandwich would have eaten overall wet since the bun is soft.

I still don't think it's anything special, but it's mediocre if you don't have to wait 45 minutes for it.  The cashier was not very nice, and no other staff person was anything great either.  I ordered the egg salad sandwich and biscuit.  The biscuit was better this time than it was the first time I went there.  The honey butter was a lot better.  It still wasn't a nice flaky biscuit though.  It was kind of more like a bagel.  The egg salad sandwich was fine, but nothing special.    If there was no wait, I'd possibly go here again.  If the line is longer than 5 minutes, it's really not worth your time.  With all the other quick service restaurants in Cosmopolitan right now, there might be a better choice, but this is good for something that isn't fried or a dessert.",

I came here with high expectations and intentions of ordering their egg sandwich but as I kept looking at the menu, I decided to order the wagyu sandwich. I'm a bit disappointed that I did change my order. The wait to order was LONG... if you're determined to try eggsslut, and the wait doesn't bother you then go for it.   I wasn't too impressed with the sandwich and the biscuit was very disappointing. I assumed that they bake fresh biscuits, but I saw they had them sitting out and popped it back in the oven to re heat it..... I ate half of it and threw it away. As for the sandwich, it was a bit plain.. I needed some tripe of condiment to add some type of flavor. Nevertheless, I still finished the sandwich. I ended up paying about $20 for both the two items.  My friend ordered a burger and she was not impressed, and didn't bother finishing it.   I would only come back to actually try their egg sand which.",

Now, this isn't exactly a bad thing but when you're not prepared bad things can happen.  I wish someone had warned me.  Other than that, the sandwich was very good.  Nice flavors and perfectly cooked egg.    What you need to order is the SLUT.  Yep, even if you read the description and are like \"hmmm coddled egg?  Let me just get a sandwich...\" do it.  Seriously.  Probably the best thing I've eaten for breakfast in ages.  Perfect texture to go with the crispy baguette.  Luscious and smooth.  Rich in flavor with just the PERFECT amount of saltiness.    And you're going to have to wait in line.  Every time I come by this place there is a long line that curves around down the hallway to the bathrooms.  That's what prevented me from going because who wants to wait in a line like that?  Luckily for me, I went in the afternoon and there was no line at all.  However, I now know that I would wait in that line.  For that slut.",

Came here on 4/27 Saturday morning which was my last day in Vegas before my flight back home to SFO Airport. (Bay Area represent!)  Ordered the Egg, Cheese and Sausage Sandwich & Fairfax. Both were very tasty! The Fairfax was a little spicier though.   While I'm rating 5 stars for the food, I'm rating 3.5 stars on the customer service. We asked her to cut the sandwiches in half. She apologized and said she couldn't. I mean why? We paid over $10 each. It only takes 10 seconds to cut it with a big knife. I was splitting it with 2 people. Another customer requested his to be cut too. We ended up cutting it ourselves with a plastic knife.   Other than that minor con I'll still return.",

Lots of bacon and not enough egg in my opinion. I'm all about having the right proportions haha. They also add ketchup to the san which which I think was too much. The Fairfax sandwich my boyfriend ordered was a lot better. It had very fluffy eggs and the spicy mayo added lots of flavor. Next time, I'll get this for sure.",

If you just need to stuff your gullet with some eggs on toast, White Castle does breakfast sliders (no shade, sometimes that's what u need).   Eggslut has mastered their eggs. I got the cheeseburger and they even accomodated my gluten-allergic ass by putting it on mixed greens, word. It was really filling and gave me energy til the evening. Bf got a breakfast sandwich and still talks about it.  Anyway, this is some fine handling of eggs. An eggslut egg is made in a pan but it doesn't get brown on the bottom and yet the white is COOKED PERFECTLY!!!!   The result is an egg that is soft and yielding, not rubbery, with a silky yolk  and no sliminess; like a poached egg but firmer.   It's simple and done well.   Eggslut has bar seating (cramped) and some cushy and adorable egg-shaped seating outside of the shop. It's not a place where you really want to have a sit-down meal, more of a quick bite kind of stop.",

The bread is so soft and chewy, the egg and cheese and bacon is juicy and delicious!  3. Coffees and juices are standard...  The ambiance  1. Limited seating 2. Mainly you will be sitting with others on a long bench table unless you take it to go.  Recommend trying to snag a seat/cushy couch associated with Cosmo somewhere nearby for more privacy 3. Cosmopolitan hotel is just one of the most dazzling and Gorgeous hotels/casino.  You'll get plenty of that   Service  1. Sadly never been good.  I wish it could so I could give 4/5 stars.  Lady at the counter looks upset and never smiles or even greets  2. Guys prepping food are not that helpful either , they just gesture to other people down the line if you need something, I guess they are too busy to help.  3. Napkins are sometimes out and the tables unclean.    MoJo 1. If you're just prepared for \"Serve yourself\" vibe, you'll be rewarded with delicious bacon and egg sandwiches! Most people get addicted to the \"egg slut\" dish it is named after I believe. Worth trying",

    "text": "The best breakfast sandwich I have ever had!  This gourmet breakfast sandwich takes comfort food to another level.  All of their ingredients are made from scratch and the bread is made locally.  You can taste the freshness.  The sandwich I recommend is the GAUCHO.  The Gaucho is seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun.  The tri-tip was cooked medium and to perfectoin then you get the run of the egg yolk with the chimichurri on the back end then the nice chew of the brioche bun.  Nothing but spectacular.   The next sandwich I recommend is I went basic and did the SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE.  The sandwich consists of house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun.  This sandwich was simple and all the ingredients complemented each other nicely.  Keep it simple stupid!  The only negative was that there was not to many places to sit since this place is always busy but for good reason they make amazing from scratch food.  They are also a little pricey for just breakfast sandwiches but they are worth the try for sure.  So, if you are in Vegas next time and you walk but the SLUT go over and buy one!  Haha!

Sure glad that wasn't the case!   I ordered the slut, some fresh oj, and some water. I forgot about requesting extra bread like someone had suggested but that was okay! Delicious! I love potatoes so I knew we were going to get along just fine. I would have liked a bit more chives but I'm probably in the minority. I did feel like I could have easily asked for chives and been accommodated.  Choice of music blasting here was nice and all throwbacks when I went which I really enjoyed.   It was fun to sit and eat and people watch. Because it was a weekday morning, there was a good mix of locals who worked nearby, business people, and tourists. I will stop by again next time to try a sandwich!",

    "text": "Great concept. Just some small issues with execution.  The idea behind this place is amazing, and I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner on the strip. Tons of drunk, high, hungover people wandering around. FINALLY a place to satisfy their cravings, give them what they need, what they desire. Eggy, cheesy, gluttonous magic on a buttery hunk of bread. MMMMMMM.  The food itself is amazing and the menu very customizable. There is something for everyone, well, everyone who loved eggs, OBV. My one issue is that, in an effort to make this place a little more to-go, there is a lack of seating. Therefore, the problem arises where people who haven't gotten their food yet, scoop up seats and those who have just gotten their food are left holding their plate and deciding, okay I guess I HAVE to take this to-go. Another thing I noticed is that they can get pretty backed up with orders and you can wait a WHILE for your egg sandwich.   Honestly, it's so good it's worth the wait and battle for a seat, in my opinion. However, I think the the less chill tourist might be deterred just looking at the place. Just saying. Obviously I give them 4 stars, because it's just that good.",

I did however eat a really tasty biscuit & a burger sans the egg.   Be prepared to wait upwards of 30-45 minutes standing in line. The good news is there is a bathroom right next to the hallway where the line forms. Seating will come at a premium also as there aren't many chairs. As you get to order, if you're with someone, have them go grab seats so you can grub when your food is ready. Enjoy!",

Service was quick considering the length of the line (we waited maybe 20 min, and the line was backed up to the bathrooms in the hallway) and they were friendly. Egg was cooked perfect. The sausage was probably not my favorite, but it was still good.",

I ordered the slut which was tasty but very small for the price. I would def opt for a breakfast sandwich next time for cheaper. It was a much larger person, my friend loved hers.

How do they do the slut???  CON: -a little bit pricey for what you get. Bottled water, coffee, and canned soda's priced at $5.00! I'm sure the space is expensive at the a Cosmopolitan, so I get it.

    "text": "On our first day in Vegas, we found out that they had Eggslut located in the Cosmopolitan which is right across from where we were staying.  Sooo happy because I've been wanting to try this place.  I knew they had one in LA but no idea there was one in Vegas.    Upon arriving, there was a pretty long line going down the hallway where the bathrooms are.  The line almost made me want to go somewhere else but what the heck. We're in Vegas and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  So we probably waited about 15-20 min in line.  Wasn't too bad. But then again, we are waiting for a sandwich. Although it's not just any sandwich.. it's an Eggslut sandwich and I can definitely say I am one.  I love eggs period.  Runny, boiled, poached, scrambled.. I like it all.  Anyways, when we finally got to order, I found out the turkey sausage was out.  So I opted for my second choice which was The Fairfax sandwich.  Our order came out pretty quick.  The problem was not enough tables but we luckily snagged a spot.  We came in a big group so our other friends sat a few tables down from us.  Now for the sandwich.. the brioche bun was definitely the perfect bun to use for an egg sandwich.  My scrambled eggs were a little bit on the runnier/softer side which made it a little hard to eat but still very delicious.  I could taste the sriracha mayo in the sauce but I feel like it was still missing something.  Maybe a little more flavor.  But it was still good nonetheless and surprisingly very filing.   Overall I'm glad I got to try the place.  I wasn't blown away but it satisfied my cravings.",

Overall, it was a solid delicious sandwich but it was over priced, the line was long, and there were only a few seats that my friends and I had to eye and grab before anyone else took them.  I tried: The fairfax sandwich ($8) with added bacon ($4). So $12 for scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo.  I loved it, but I wouldn't wait that long for a pricey breakfast sandwich with no guaranteed seating. I tried my friends' bacon egg and cheese sandwich and sausage egg and cheese sandwich, and they all actually liked mine best. Their sandwiches were pretty messy to eat too.",

There were also slices of bread for you to dip the eggs and potatoes. This was okay, but I don't know if it's worth it. Also, it kind of sucked that the seating was limited. There were no seats, so we had to find a table in Cosmo hotel. However the workers here were very polite and diligent, which I appreciated.

For sure to be coming back to this place over secret pizza any new day! Plus it's open late nights! Perfect drunk food!!!",

If there is any line- it should be all hands on deck to take care of customers.   To add insult to injury, by the time we got our food, it was cold. Waste of a restaurant.",

It almost wasn't even warm enough to be lukewarm and it just tasted bad...for $5, I would really like a coffee that didn't taste like 7/11 $1 coffee.   They also missed my friend's order, but were quick to remedy it even when it was busy so +1 for that.

We walked about 20 mins and arrived at eggslut which is located in the Cosmopolitan.This place is really easy to find once you walk in.  We lined up for about 10 to 15 mins, as there is only 1 cashier and not alot of seats- so you pretty much have to eat quickly and leave.  This place offers you to substitute bread with salad with no extra charge and the salad is very good. We ordered the gaucho sandwich - tri-tip wagyu steak - and changed it to the salad. And of course - had to order their specialty \"the slut\".  Overall i would say this place is worth the wait.  The steak was soft and juicy and the slut is really unique and tastey.",

The line stretching around the corner and down the hall was extreme and had me second guessing my decision. The end of the line to the counter to place my order took about ten minutes and the staff was friendly. After placing my order (2 sandwiches) it took another ten minutes to receive my order. The food was hot as everything is cooked by order and the taste was what I expected, but the portion was smaller than I thought. I left not hungry but not fully satisfied. The long line and the price I paid didn't equal to the end result in my opinion.",

I would have liked a little more heat from the Sriracha mayonnaise and a softer texture for the brioche bun, but those technicalities were overshadowed by the overall flavor of the sandwich.   In terms of environment, this location is small, with limited seating. There was also a pretty long line when we arrived at about 8:30 in the morning. Service is typical counter service.  Although the food is great, it's also very overpriced for the portion you get. $12 for a breakfast sandwich the size of my fist?

At 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday, the line was about 12 people deep, but it moved fairly quickly. Order at the counter and wait for your food.   I got 3 different sammys: sausage, bacon and egg salad. The sandwiches were all solid and I like the arugula to give it some veg action.  Overall, nothing special -- stuff I can easily make at home. But it's one of the cheaper options inside Cosmo. Or, you can cross the street and go to McD's for a sausage egg mcmuffin -- that would satisfy a similar craving.",

SLUT* - poached egg on top of a potato mousse - creamy, light, you get your protein and carbs in and it's nicely savory and topped with some chives.  goes great alone or on top of the bread they give you - sliced baguette bread with a fragrant olive oil  needless to say that it was as simple and good as i hoped for.  definitely on my radar for a simple eat that won't upset my stomach",

The homemade turkey sausage was simply divine - savory with just a little heat. The brioche buns are nice and buttery too. Our breakfast sandwiches were so filling that we both skipped lunch.

Outside of walking a long way in The Cosmpolitan hotel to find it, it was found and I ordered a Fairfax. I had wanted an Eggslut T-shirt but the one I wanted was unavailable due to a lawsuit, meaning it was the Nirvana homage and while Lisa Orth designed the Nirvana shirt, perhaps Sub Pop didn't want a sandwich spot to steal her idea, even if there are countless parodies of the shirt. Nonetheless, the eggs were nice and clean and having it on a brioche was great. I'd come back here again.",

    "text": "Omg I love sluts. And porn. To clarify: Eggslut and food porn.  Only in Vegas is this punniness so fitting and appropriately inappropriate ^^;  Seeing the long line wrap around the corner, I thought Eggslut would be over-hyped, with most customers comprised of either hipster wannabes with an obsessive love for glass jars, or those in need of brunchy hangover therapy. (On weekends, it even opens at midnight so you can get gourmet breakfast for drunchies!)  Despite the potential for an inflated hype factor, the concept of craft eggs still piqued my curiosity and I decided to check it out... and ended up coming here 2 days in a row.  The Slut ($10.82 - a coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette): Their signature. Simple in concept as egg and potatoes in a jar with some bread on the side for good measure; complex in reality with the simplicity of homemade mashed potatoes contrasting the orgasmic runny yolk with a sprinkle of earthy chives. Even the baguette is top-notch, tasting like the crostini of high-end restaurants and drizzled with a dash of olive oil. You're supposed to mix the egg/potatoes jar and spread it on the baguette, but I also enjoyed eating part of it separately and less mixed to bring out different flavors. It could do with less salt, but it was otherwise layery goodness.  The Gaucho ($16.22 - seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg): The heartiest menu item. The steak is a bit too salty and may be dry with respect to hard-core steak standards, but for slices in my breakfast it was definitely quality. The combination of tri-tip, chimichurri, and red onions rendered a piquant Argentinian flavor profile, and the egg was more of an afterthought. I suggest getting the salad version because the steak pairs well with the nutty arugula dressed in a tangy, citrusy sauce and a sprinkle of shaved parmesan.  *Note that you can substitute the brioche bun with arugula salad for any of their breakfast sandwiches.   Service is efficient and friendly, though workers do seem to get chatty amongst themselves. Both times, I waited momentarily in anticipation for my order to be called, after I already saw the food prepared.   I applaud Eggslut's conscientiousness to sustainability (much needed, especially in light of the new climate-change-denying presidential administration... eww). All boxes and utensils are compostable, and Slut glasses are recycled. Slut glasses? Pun not intended :3  The verdict? Eggcellent! Not your cheapest breakfast, but good value in comparison to the $12 bottled juice and $14 smoothies at Juice Standard next door.",

I wasn't able to take a picture of one of their specialties called the \"slut\" which is basically a coddled egg on top of a potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. We ate it too fast because of how good it was lol but I was able to capture a picture of the sandwich I got as well. I forgot the name of the sandwich but it had bacon egg and cheese. Delicious! I would stand in line again to enjoy another food item from here. Definitely recommend!",

Their actual sandwiches are made on fresh bread and the egg itself is perfectly cooked! The one with bacon (they give you a lot of bacon) is pretty good, and their hamburger is just OK.",

Food: 3  We got the Bacon, Egg, & Cheese and Sausage, Egg, & Cheese. They tasted as expected. I do appreciate that their egg was well cooked and that their buns weren't soggy. However, I think the price is astronomical for something that can easily be made at home. Trust me, I've paid far more for far less without a peep because it's creativity warranted it.  Service: 3  As a casual eatery, you order at the counter and pick up your order to eat when your name is called. The line was long, but it wasn't more than a 20-25 minute wait when I stopped by on a Saturday morning. The staff keeps everything moving pretty fast.  Ambiance: 3  It's a cute store in the Cosmo, but seating is very limited. I guess they assumed people might walk and eat or sit somewhere else in the Cosmo? But the sandwiches can get super messy when you eat them, so more seating would be nice.",

We waited for amount 20 minutes in line just to give an order.. everything is fresh and made to order, took another 10 minutes to get the food. A little on the expensive side $5- for a small fresh orange juice and $11- for my sandwich. I decided to get the Fairfax and add bacon. The food was decent but not for the price though. I love lots of flavor and the sauce on the sandwich didn't do much for me. But overall it seemed more of a healthier breakfast choice. I love that you were able to watch the cooks work their magic right in front of you.. more of an assembly line 1 man cooking the eggs, another cooking the bacon, 1 man getting the wraps opened and ready for finished sandwiches and another putting the breakfast together. Not much to sit since it is a very small area and lots of traffic of everyone becoming an Eggslut... but seating is available across from the place if you don't mind sharing a table.",

It's funny because as hyped as it was, I was still skeptical..like how good could this egg sandwich be really? There had to be a reason why the lines were always hella long both at this location and in LA, right?   After a good 30 or so minutes in line, I understood just what everyone was raving about. After much deliberation, I chose the Fairfax with bacon over the Eggslut but only because the bacon and egg sandwich looked more filling than the piece of bread and the sous vide egg/gravy combo. I'm sure it was still delicious though. The Fairfax was amazing and very well worth the wait. At $11.50 or $8.50, sans bacon, it's not the cheapest sandwich but it's still cheap for a Vegas meal. I was okay with just the one Fairfax, but definitely could've eaten a second one if I felt like blowing more $$$.   Only part that sucks about this is that I have to wait until I'm back in Vegas or LA to enjoy. PLZ BRING ONE TO THE BAY SOON!",

Maybe 8-10 minutes. Service was ok. I was planning to bring it to my room and eat it there, but couldn't wait. I found a spot to sit and ate the breakfast sandwich with bacon. My first bite was, it wasn't that bad. Second & third bite was, hey, it's pretty good. I got more bite of the bacon and sauce. The egg yolk squirted and dripped down onto my legs. No warning. I didn't think the egg yolk would do that. Finished it and walk back to the room. I gave the turkey breakfast sandwich to my husband and he said it was very good. He likes it. Again no warning, the egg yolk squirted all over his black shirt LOL. I did prewarn him but he didn't listened. Overall, it was good. We would definitely stop by again.",

Ofc it will be overpriced but it's Vegas. You already spent 120% more on that drink you ordered at the bar which is mainly ice so why weigh your options?  I ordered myself a Fairfax with Avocado because I needed to let everyone know I'm from California. What I got was soft, Golden scrambled eggs with melted cheddar cheese tucked inside a glistening Brioche bun. For the kick, the Sriracha Mayo does it's job well.   Just writing this review got me hungry.  A little warning though, IT IS MESSY. When you put scrambled anything, especially perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, everything falls apart very quickly. My advice is to use the paper wrapping to catch any egg and use a fork to just eat it normally after you devour your sandwich.   Oh...their Wagyu burger is good but honestly, go for the eggs. They're named Eggslut for a reason.",

Get over it, it's an awesome breakfast and the line moves relatively fast - don't let it intimidate you because the food is worth it!  I've had the egg sandwiches before, but my wife convinced me to go for the \"Slut\". A little awkward to order (\"I'd like a slut\"), but so delicious that it made up for it. Perfectly coddled egg sitting on delicious potatoes to spread on perfectly toasted baguettes... just do it.  I also got a cold brew here ($5), but it's a better deal if you drink it and get one to go (free refills!).",

Not because you need two - but because you'll want them.   5 stars on the Fairfax sandwich. I added Italian sausage which turned out to be an incredible decision. The fluffy eggs, the chives, the aioli, the herbed sausage with a slight touch of heat, the grilled brioche bun, the cheese.... It's all enough to make you want to dig for the little bits of egg that escape the sandwich and land in the bag. No shame. It's that good. This is the stuff of your egg sandwich dreams. Dreams you didn't even know you had.  BRAVE THE LINE. Trust me. I almost waited in line again for a second sandwich and I started out partially annoyed of the 20 minute line. After my first sandwich, I almost voluntarily jumped back in line and would have if we didn't have plans.",

The seating is limited but the Cosmo has an Alice in Wonderland themed lounge area right besides the restaurant for you to eat if you don't want to-go. I think the highlight of the sandwiches is actually the bread which is really soft and helps add to the sandwich as a whole. My friend and I also shared the slut which is like a potato-y mix with egg. Pretty tasty and reminded us of a warm potato salad.",

I had heard lots on how good Eggslut is from the social medias, and while I have fallen out of love with eggs as I've gotten older, it sounded like it would hit the spot.  Was a bit disappointed to not find any Filipino food on the menu, but that was just me setting up my own expectations. The wait wasn't long, and the prices were fine (except for $5 for a pop).  I decided on the Fairfax, their only sandwich with soft scrambled eggs on it, and added turkey sausage.  Wow, what a bomb of flavor. It was a tad on the salty side, but the creamy eggs and big soft brioche buns was an amazing combination. It wasn't greasy or heavy at all, despite the amount of eggs, cheese and meat involved. Almost of all of us devoured our sandwiches. One of our crew said they preferred McDonald's to this, but I think that guy just hated eggs more than me.  In fact, I think this made me kind of like eggs again.  Is this the ultimate breakfast sandwich spot? With the amount of care put into the bread and eggs, which are really the stars here, it's hard to argue.",

    "text": "I once again made the trek to Eggslut with my family and drew many of the same conclusions I made when dining here at Christmas.   But I've downgraded them because of the unsanitary conditions they expect people to dine at. While the food was good / fresh, the tables and chairs were filthy. During the 45 minutes or so it took to order and get food, not once were the tables or counters cleaned / wiped down. We managed to find a small table, but it had dried egg yolk smeared all over the tables and chairs. Trash was left sitting on tables.   The Cosmo is supposed to be high class. Sadly, this is anything but. I noted the cleanliness last time and they responded - but clearly they were just trying to appease a criticism on yelp.   Original Review: Is the food good? Yes. Is it worth waiting in a 45 minute line? Probably not. Eggslut is a trendy place that's worth visiting at least once. But you're probably better off going at an \"off time\" to avoid the long lines.   For the price paid per sandwich, you could get a complete breakfast at most other places. You're really paying a premium for its trendiness.   I went with my family and waited close to an hour. While the food was ultimately fine, none of the tables had been cleaned, despite numerous people having dined on them previously. It really cheapened the experience for everyone.   Conclusion: Come to say you had it. Don't come with your family thinking you'll be sitting down for a quiet breakfast.",

Have tried another location for their classic breakfast sandwich (sausage, egg, cheese) which I didn't think was worth the upcharge ($7.50).  Today we were no fools and decided to try the FAIRFAX and the Eggslut. Fairfax fluffy scrambled eggs was totally worth a try with a bit of kick from sriracha mayo topping. Price of $7.50 felt more worth it for the uniqueness of the cook. Eggslut surprised us as you get a real explosion of salt once you hit the potato puree. Still a bit pricey for the quantity at $9.  Worth a visit if you haven't tried but not sure I'd wait 45min again especially when there is tons to eat in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Recommend waiting for a counter seat to watch the cooking magic happen.",

Selected the Egg Salad Sandwich as my main entree since it is one of the healthier options (the Fairfax looked good too but not as much greens). Bun was toasted nice and a nice contrast to the cold egg salad sandwich. The flavor was robust without coming across as heavy. The mustard was light, and would be appealing to even those who don't care for mustard.",

    "text": "I was actually craving this, so didn't mind standing in the long line since this location is actually more convenient than the Grand Central Market location for me.  Although quite tasty, I would have to say that it's no big deal.  The brioche is key as good bread makes any sandwich better.  The Bacon, Egg, and Cheese was just okay.  The star of this sandwich is the bread.  The cheeseburger was disappointing now that gourmet burgers are easy to find, especially with Shake Shacks all over the West Coast now.  The meat was unremarkable, and my egg wasn't medium as advertised, so the yolk didn't run.  It made for a pretty dry burger.  The Fairfax was probably the best sandwich of the day since the soft scrambled egg was smooth and creamy.    Overall it's just not worth the wait and price.  Serving sizes are just too small for the price, and it's not like they have many options on the menu to fill up on fries and sides.  My 4 year old daughter was able to finish her sandwich without any trouble.  That shouldn't be enough food for any adult, no matter how light an eater you are.",

Otherwise, I would have been really annoyed because the food was so-so. I had the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich. The bacon is nice and thick and the brioche bread is buttery. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing, but I was really underwhelmed. If you see a long line at this place and are debating whether to stand in line for 30+ minutes, don't feel back if you decide to skip it.",

If you kinda like eggs, you must go. If you hate eggs? Enh, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you will should go. My husband hates eggs with any kind of runny yolk, and even he loves the food.  Why? Because everything is SO GOOD! I tend to get the Eggslut (coddled on top fo mashed potatoes in a jar, comes with oval toast slices). Sometimes I dip the toast straight in, sometimes I mix it up and then dip the toast, it's yummy either way.  The bacon and egg sandwich is also heavenly.  I would just suggest getting there when they open if it's Friday-Sunday, otherwise you will wait a long time. Weekdays is no line morning, afternoon, or evening, but that's just my experience.",

Atmosphere - Very basic.  A long line to get to the register.  Then a wait for them to call you name.  Some seating in the place and additional in the common area.  We got lucky and were able to sit together.  Food   Drink - Modelo Especial Chelada, a very large can.  First time having a chelada, it was like having a beer version of a bloody Mary.  I loved it!    Food - Of course I had to have the slut.  A coddled egg on top of a potato puree served in a narrow mason jar with three slices of toasted baguettes.  Using the baguettes to dip into the yoke and potatoes was s heavenly. Ten plus dollars makes for a special treat.  Our cashier told us they were small so I order the biscuit too.  The honey butter was not to sweet but made the biscuit so special.  Service - With four people ordering and not sure what everyone ordered we paid our bill.  After our name was called we determined we missed a slut, but the food matched the receipt.  Thankfully we did not have to get back in line.  Our cashier used the second register to get us the third slut and quickly the food came out.  Future - I hope so.",

We saw the long lines the day before so we headed there the next day early around 8 am.  The line was manageable and moved fast.  Unfortunately they were sold out of the steak sandwich which was odd because it was only 8am but they must have sold so many the day before.  I went for the fairfrax: cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. Added bacon and avocado.  It was everything I wanted it to be.  Soft scrambled eggs make all the difference.  Sriracha mayo tops it off, onions kinda lost...   Not 5 stars because 2 sandwiches without a side was pricey.  Added an OJ and a $10 canned spiked coffee, and breakfast was $50.",

The Long line that moves faster than it takes for your order to be ready was surprising. All the napkin holders were empty. And  tables not wiped down. If you want to eat here it's very tricky to get a table. It doesn't help when people insist on using the hot commodity of chairs for their laptop bag and aren't interested in giving it up. The price wasn't too bad for what you get. I guess if you need something to fill your belly till lunch and don't want to go to a sit-down table service place and pay a lot, then I guess this is a good option.

    "text": "I'd heard about this chain a couple years ago and figured if I ever got near one I wanted to try it. While I was in town I was going through my feed and noticed there was this one at the Cosmopolitan. I got up a little early the next morning on a weekday and walked down the strip about 8:30 or so to check it out.  Line didn't look bad, oh, there's a few more people right around the wall from the entrance, okay no big deal, is that a hallway behind the wall, oh crap are there going to be a million people in line down that hallway, yikes! Eh, it wasn't bad, the line was about halfway down the hallway behind the place, and I wanted to try it, so I got in line. If it didn't move, I could always bail. It moved slowly for the first few minutes, but picked up steam. I think the whole thing from line to finish eating was a little more than 30 minutes.  I got one of the biscuits, and the egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich, hold the chipotle ketchup or whatever because I ain't one of those weirdo's that eat ketchup on my eggs. I was concerned the sandwich might be dry, but the medium egg had enough yoke to make it a non issue. Short wait for food. I thought the sandwich was really good, everything seemed really fresh, the bacon and egg itself tasted the best. The biscuit with the honey butter was good to, but I wouldn't spend the $4 to get one again. I thought the prices were okay (we're in Vegas people, nothing is cheap, quit bitching about food prices) and was glad I made the effort. Next time I find myself in Vegas, if the opportunity is there, I would eat here again.",

I wish Eggslut were open later so I could go there for a late night snack or dinner. I guess the only bad part is that the food falls out of the sandwich. But, it falls out because there are so many good ingredients in the sandwich - so the con definitely outweighs the pro for me!  Affordable prices. Sometimes, there's a long line. I only waited 5 minutes to get served. The service has always been very friendly.  There are tables to sit at or you can take it to go. I wish I could make an egg sandwich like this!

Best part, you don't have to wait too long for the food as well!  I ordered the Fairfax sandwich (it comes with scrambled eggs, chives, grilled onions and a Siracha mayo) and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with a fried egg. Both were absolutely delicious! The eggs in the Fairfax sandwich was super fluffy and you can add bacon/turkey sausage/avocado for an additional cost. For me, the sandwich was very flavorful and adding bacon or sausage would be too salty for me. We also ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice ($5) Fresh and creamy!   It is a little overpriced for the orange juice and sandwiches (we paid a little over $30 for two sandwiches, one orange juice and one bottled water) but it's super worth it. It's a good portion and it fills up your stomach!",

    "text": "We didn't know where to go for breakfast on our first morning in Vegas and we were not disappointed in our choice to eat here. It was a Saturday morning and the line was around the corner but we decided to wait anyway. The line moved fairly fast and it was only about 20-30 minutes.  The people were very friendly and the chef was trying to pose in the background while we were taking pictures. We enjoyed watching them prepare the food and they joked around a lot with us.   The main critique would be a lack of places to sit when you get your food. It's a fairly small place with only 20 seats or so. When we found a new place outside to sit, the food was worth it. We got the fairfax, the slut, and a biscuit along with some coffee. The fairfax was very good. The bread was fresh and light and the eggs were very well prepared. The Sriracha mayo was concerning at first but subtle and well done. The slut came with instructions but with the bread was very good. It was a combination of mashed potato and smooth cream egg. I know, it doesn't sound good but it was great. The biscuit was also very good and I'd recommend it but when I saw it cost $5, I assumed it would be at least two biscuits and not just one. Coffee was also just ok. Not great but I didn't expect it to be.  Overall, I would rate Eggslut very highly. The food was fantastic and that's the most important part. I would definitely eat here again.",

We were able to try their famous eggslut, the cookie, and 2 of their sandwiches: sausage egg and cheese + egg salad sandwich. Flavors were good but nothing to be excited about. Nothing too extravagant and something you can make at home more less than a quarter of the price.   I suppose the hype was how simple it was. However an $8 breakfast sandwich? No thanks. I will say the Eggslut was a nice take on the poached side of the egg. Cooked sous vide, it was delicate and fresh. But again, for $10? No thanks.   The wait times for our food remained long. However, it is understandable since they cook every one to order. Still, nearly 20 minutes for a few orders is really pushing it.   Overall just ok, but go elsewhere if you're looking for a cheap and quick breakfast.",

Ordered the cheeseburger with the egg over hard though the menu said over medium. Runny eggs - not my thing. Anyhow, good juicy burger. Messy so grab some napkins. It's a hangover cure for sure. I suspect it's been ordered before with that in mind.   Took about 15 minutes to get my burger. Got my warm salted chocolate chip cookie first. Maybe the over hard make it take longer. Couple of people after me received their order first. No matter! We're in Vegas so we have until the wee hours to hit the town.   Burger was $10 plus $2 for avocado - my choice for the avo. Burger came alone. No fries, chips, etc. Yet a decent deal especially for Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been dying to get back to the Cosmpolitan for Eggslut! We absolutely loved it before and I am not even a huge egg fan. Our favorite is the sausage/egg/cheese. Unfortunately, we had it yesterday and today and both times it was not what we remembered. The bread was cold and not fresh-textured. The sausage was lukewarm and the egg wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese. There seemed to be an odd ratio of sauce as well, which is also cold. The whole sandwich feels like separate components brought together, rather than a cohesive unit. It was extremely disappointing because the price is high so the previous quality made up for that. This time I could only stand half the sandwich which wasn't a terrific value by any means. I understand any restaurant having an off day. That's why we went back today. Sad to say, I'm not sure I have it in me to be disappointed again. I hate that a former favorite has to be eliminated from my list of must-haves.",

The place is a bit small with limited seating area, I believe that's why the lines are unnecessarily long most of the time, but it is definitely a popular place despite the small size.  I ordered an eggsalad sandwich, for a quick pick me up before heading out for meetings. I had a hard finding an empty seat for just myself , waited for a few minutes for someone else to finish up first.  The egg salad was creamy , almost melts in my mouth with every bite! Worth every dollar! The pretzel bread adds a bit of a special taste to the sandwich ! Definitely a must try place for the food, and even more so just to try it because why wouldn't you want to try a restaurant named \"eggslut\"",

It was literally the best breakfast sandwich I have had. Whatever sauce they used is what made the sandwich. The bacon was crisp and the bun was fluffy yet firm. My husband ordered the Gaucho sandwich which he says they don't have over where we live. He loved it as well and said it beats out all the other stuff he has tried.  They were quick with orders and also serve beer! Which is a good tip since your in Vegas and I am sure you might want one in the morning. The water is also a little cheaper than the surrounding vendors.",

At around 8 in the morning there was already a line, but we still got our order in fast. I ordered the Slut and my husband got the Fairfax with turkey sausage. I would say everything was.. descent. I mean it was pretty good but I felt like I was overhyped, the slut is like a poached egg over a sort of a potato puree which was good but probably not something I'd eat again. My husband's sandwich was okay too, the eggs were well made for scrambled but we both didn't care much for the sausage of the brioche buns. Aesthetically, the presentation of the food and restaurant is nice, great music, and the line moves fast but overall wasn't as impressed as I'd hope to be.. especially since for everything plus two coffees was around 35-40 bucks. Would still be willing to try something else and give it a second try though.",

Plus the line moves pretty fast anyways. My girlfriend and I shared the Fairfax sandwich (with avocado and bacon added) and a \"slut\", and this was enough to fill both of us up! Both were so yummy that we came back and ordered the same exact thing the next day! :)  The Fairfax is honestly the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! It's scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo all on a brioche bun. & The avocado and bacon made for a delicious addition to it!  The Slut is a coddled egg (similar to a poached egg) on top of what I would call a mashed potato puree. It's served in a glass jar and you mix it all up and spread it on the baguettes it's served with. Different, but good! You can ask for extra baguettes when ordering and it's no charge.   The drinks (coffee and oj) are definitely overpriced, but good. The orange juice was obviously fresh and tasted just like an orange. You can also ask for a refill of your coffee, and it's free!",

The line was long and down a dim hallway that was 10 to 15 degrees above room temperature; we removed many layers while we waited. We all ordered Fairfax Sandwiches + turkey sausage and got an arugula salad to share. Seating was a bit of an issue, but we did find a spot.  The salad was simple and very good. The sandwiches were awesome! Be sure to get two napkins.",

Their meals are so good, And worth the trip.  The lines are long, But goes pretty quick.  Is it the Slut or sandwiches? Just take your pick.  The Slut is coddled egg, On a potato puree.  Not my favorite, had a taste, And gave it away.  I like the Fairfax, It's scrambled with cheese. The burger is awesome, Make it a double, please.  The bacon and cheese is simple, And taste pretty good. Egg lovers unite! Come here, you should.  They're closed at night, And that's my tip. They also have delicious cookie, Made with chocolate chip.    I'll be back for more,  It's a matter of time. I'm a fan of Eggslut,  Now that's the bottom line.",

    "text": "** THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW OF EGGSLUT IN L.A. EVERYTHING APPLIES TO THE VEGAS LOCATION AS WELL = DAMN GOOD**  I just came back from my trip to L.A and I can honestly say I can see myself being a California gal. The weather, foodie scene & a few hilarious Uber drivers would all be worth it. Being the major foodie that I am, I had a list of restaurants that I knew I had to eat at. One being EGGSLUT *heart eyes emoji*. It was so exciting to learn that I only had to walk about 6 minutes to the Grand Central Market, which is where ES is located, from my DTLA hotel. Trust me, I was fan girlin' all over the place.      The Ambiance   Eggslut is located inside of the Grand Central Market in Downtown LA.(VEGAS location is inside of 'The Cosmopolitan' Hotel) The market is bustling with locals and tourists alike who have a serious appetite. There's seriously everything kind of cuisine you could imagine. Eggslut in particular has a cult following of sluts who are serious about their breakfast. ES is more like a stand-alone store within the market. As we inched closer and closer to the cashier and kitchen, our heads began bobbing. They were playing the best old school 90's music. I'm sure it was nostalgic for all the millennials in line, too. Overall, the experience was very laid-back and cool. Very much like what I expected just from their Instagram feed.   The Service  To be straight-up and frank about it all, we waited in line for about 1.5 hours. (VEGAS wait was about 25 mins) BUT, I PROMISE IT WAS WORTH THE HYPE & WAIT. Nevertheless, the food will make up for it. There was so much going on in the market that we were able to keep ourselves entertained. We even met a friend in line (Hey Winne!) She gave us the scoop on L.A.'s best food. All of the Eggslut team was friendly, nice and they moved so fast. We might've waited an hour to order, but it was ten minutes--tops-- for our food. The guy behind the counter calls you by name and repeats your order. Kind of rare these days--adds a nice touch.   The Food  THEY HAD SRIRCHA. Seriously, that will always be enough for me. I ordered the 'Bacon Egg & Cheese' + added avocado. Delicious. It was nice and hot--no cold food at ES. The bacon was hardwood smoked bacon, super thick-cut. Over-medium egg and velvety cheddar cheese. HELLO. All of their sandwiches are served on a warmed brioche bun, which adds a nice softness. Most of us ordered a sandwich, but my BFF, Teyana, wanted to be adventurous. She went all the way slutty & ordered the SLUT,  \"a coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar and served with a demi baguette.\" (Thanks EGGSLUT) Pretty much, it was hella good. It's a great option for those who don't want a bun!  Ordered 'THE FAIRFAX' in Vegas and added bacon + avo. BOMB",

Should you wait in line or make a special trip to come here...no But if you are staying at the Cosmo ifs definitely worth stoppying by when it's slow.  I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews, this place pumps out fresh, made to order, tasty food in a cute atmosphere.  It's relatively fast when there isn't a line and you can watch them cooking while you wait.  They have quite a system & really rock it out so it's A-OK in my book!",

    "text": "A couple of friends suggested I stop here at some point during our Vegas weekend. Since egg is in the name we decided to come here for breakfast on Saturday. Initially walking up to the restaurant the line is deceiving. It appears to be a small wait until you see the line turn the corner. We waited about 35 minutes to order at the counter and then another 10 minutes to receive our order. Then you just hope to get lucky finding a seat somewhere.  The eggslut is a good interesting flavor, not too flavorful but still very comforting. Like the tips suggest I would ask for an extra piece of bread.  The Fairfax sandwich is very filling with perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, melted cheese, and bacon (extra charge).  The cheeseburger was in the top ten cheeseburgers I've ever had. Despite being known for the \"eggslut\" they do have a knack for cooking meat pretty well. I do recommend Eggslut but I just wish it had a shorter line or faster service but you can't rush the quality.",

Took about 30 minutes to get to the front to order, then another 20-25 to wait for our food.  I ordered the slut.  One egg in a glass jar with potato and some bread.  Very good.  I enjoyed it except I was expecting a lot more for $11.  It was my first time there so I didn't really know what to expect.  My wife ordered the bacon egg and cheese.  She said it was not warm.  Line too long to complain about it.  She ordered a smart water which ended up being a life water.  Menu said $4, the charge was $4.50. My coffee was $5.  People who were in line behind us said they were going to McDonalds.  Would I go here again?  Maybe not to this location.  Hopefully the prices are lower in the stand alone locations.  The person taking my order was very friendly and took my name but must have spelled it different because they pronounced it wrong at the pick up.  They apparently did that to a few other people too.  There were people just sitting there waiting for their food and a different name was being called.",

My friend who I was with got the Slut and a regular breakfast sandwich, but nothing compared after I tasted my Fairfax with Wagyu. It was a little pricey, but it is the strip and I had Wagyu so $18 for a sandwich not the worst I have ever seen. Service was quick, but if it is busy like it was seating can be a problem.

I was skeptical of the honey mustard, but boy oh boy was it savory and delicious! I've been thinking about that sandwich ever since I left Vegas, so much that I want to open up an Egg Slut in Baltimore myself! One can only dream. Until next time, Egg Slut.",

Walked by about a year ago as they were getting ready to open for business, and finally got to go in last week on a return trip.    Visited Monday, 12/18/17 at 11:30.  The line was wrapped around the corner down to the restrooms, it was crazy.  We jumped in line anyways, and considered abandoning ship - it definitely was a SLOW moving line.  We waited almost 30 minutes.  Eventually got to order; there was one person taking orders (this was on a Monday), and it was quite chaotic. The three of us ordered and paid separately.  I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.    The service was SUPER SLOW.  I could see they had pans full of precooked eggs, sausage, bacon and the lot...  All they had to do was slap it together!  But they just weren't cranking it out very quickly.  The guy that ordered right before me got his out in about 5 minutes.  The other two were bloody slow... Nearly 15 minutes after ordering; or 10 minutes after the guy right in front of us got his.  Not sure what the issue was, but everything was out of sorts.  Now almost **45 minutes** in, I was just happy to have a sandwich!!  Oh and the girl barking names out...  Pretty sure...  No, certain, that she hated her job.  She dgaf about anything, period.    My sandwich (again, sausage/egg/cheese) was insanely disappointing.  The brioche bun lacked any character other than \"bland.\"  The turkey sausage had potential, but likewise was bland.  The egg was super runny, which I am NOT okay with.  The cheese...  Not even melted, like it was just slapped on top of cooled ingredients.  Overall, a super disappointing experience. 45 minutes for a sandwich that was just short of \"gross\" (I'll take bland over gross) was in no way worth it.    Last comment...  the \"fresh\" OJ that was $5 for about a 12-14 oz portion was definitely not fresh tasting.  Perhaps it was fresh squeezed, but if so, the oranges that were used were anything but fresh.    Blech.  Not even sure why I'm giving two stars...  I guess because I waited so long, I didn't want it to be a total loss.  Enjoy the hype, but this place is definitely not for me.",

I've seen the restaurant on social media like snapchat countless times so I was way more thrilled to have seen this place than going to the burger joint. While waiting in line (a short line), guy behinds me said that lines are usually way longer and that they run out of food quick cuz it's that good. I originally wanted the gaucho, but it was all sold out (this was like 5pm), so I settled for the slut, which consists of a coddled egg over potato puree and three pieces of baguette. I also ordered the fairfax, homemade biscuit, and OJ. The fairfax was such a great sandwich. I usually don't like scrambled eggs but this one was really soft and flavorful. We added turkey sausage to it for a heartier meal. Don't underestimate the biscuit - the color isnt the normal golden brown, but it tastes SO GOOD. $5 for a huge biscuit - not bad. However, $5 for a small cup of OJ was a bit overboard, but can't expect much at a place like Vegas. I wish they had one back in East Coast because I would love to try the Gaucho sandwich!!",

On Friday before my flight, the day of the grand opening I knew this was a chance for me to indulge in all egg bacon goodness as much as I could. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese...and added bacon and avacado.   It was one of the best things I've ever eaten. After everyone raving about this place, I did not expect for it to be THAT good.   Those who are complaining about the price- what do you expect? It's VEGAS.  It was worth the wait and the price. I will definitely be back again!  It was egg-cellent ;)",

What was on the menu looked good, but you don't have a \"breakfast plate\" or combo-type option.  The menu is pretty limited.  We had the bacon, egg and cheese sammich and the sausage, egg and cheese sammich.  Since it doesn't come with anything, there are two sides available a la carte... a salad or a biscuit.  We got the salad, which was arugula with a very minimal amount of red wine vinaigrette and lightly shaved manchego cheese.  I didn't taste the cheese because it was sprinkled on the top and my b.f. ate it all .  It was an alright salad though.  The sammiches were good, but I needed a fork and knife to eat the sausage one because the yolk was pretty messy. Ambience is cute, but music was pretty loud for that early in the morning... I sound old .  Honestly, this place is probably a good \"late drunken night\" kinda food.  Lol",

    "text": "This was another find on Yelp and thanks to our success with Bruxie we decided to give this one a go as well. I'm a sucker for a good breakfast sandwich so I was all for trying Eggslut. We somehow missed the fact that this is located in the Cosmopolitan so we got a bit lost trying to find it but nothing major. When we got there the line was wrapped along the wall and down a side hallway. We overheard someone say that they were told that the wait would only be about 30 mins so we decided to wait and they were right. After you order, your food takes about 5/10 mins to come out so it wasn't bad at all. My boyfriend and I both loved the ingredients that were on the Fairfax but we wanted the wagyu tri-tip steak. Luckily the cashier was accommodating and able to ring us up for the Gaucho with all of the Fairfax fixings. It was a great choice! The steak was tender and flavorful. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and bun went well with the sandwich. The vibe was awesome. Everyone was very friendly and all of the cooks and manager were singing/dancing along to the music. Since we're from Cleveland, we loved the fact that they played Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. I ordered the fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was delish. Only con is that the prices are a little high for just a sandwich and they don't really have any side dishes. However, I still highly recommend and will be back during my next visit to Vegas.",

Because the lines in the LA area are ridiculous, I was hoping that the Vegas location would give me a chance to try one of these bad boys. Luckily, I found myself in Vegas on a Monday mid-morning with a reasonable line to deal with.    After waiting a few minutes, I was greeted with an understated sandwich with a warm brioche bun and scrambled eggs (with bacon). I look at it and think, okay this may disappoint me as a sandwich that isn't much better than a McGriddle. It may be just hype.   Wrong. The Fairfax is something I am craving now after a few days removed from the vegas atmosphere.  The combination of ingredients and the addition of bacon makes this sandwich that literally made me stop to think about all the times I missed out on this bad boy.  I'm sure the other menu items may be pretty good, but I'm enamored with this sandwich. I hope other people lower their ratings to weed the line out. I'd encourage you to try the restaurant, but I really don't want to battle you in line.   But really, the hype is justified, and the growth of this restaurant is indicative of other people who feel the same way as me. If you aren't happy with your sandwich, I'll take it. Serious.",

Their egg sandwiches are to die for because the egg literally melts in your mouth. I like to get my sandwiches with cheese and bacon!   DRINK: They don't give out water cups, but you can buy their amazing fresh orange juice!  ATMOSPHERE: I absolutely love anything that The Cosmopolitan has to offer. It is great that they decided to have Eggslut in their casino. It is open at midnight on weekends and makes a perfect quick meal when you're out late. There is only high-top bar seating here and they run out of seats quickly so you can expect to stand and eat sometimes. The staff is always upbeat and kind. The chefs are extremely great at their jobs and I never see them make a sandwich without a smile on their face :)",

    "text": "So, I'm from LA, so I've been hearing about Eggslut for the past couple years, but there's always a giant line, so I figured I'd check out what the fuss was about while we're staying next door. There was still a pretty big line, but nothing like the one in LA, and it moves pretty quickly (took about 15 minutes, with a line of several dozen people)  Having now tried it, I give it 5 stars *only* for the Fairfax + turkey sausage I ordered - it's easy to make decent scrambled eggs, but next to impossible to get *perfectly* scrambled eggs, and the scrambled eggs in the Fairfax are *perfect*. It's a fairly substantial sandwich, and so tasty. Worth standing in line for, which is good, because you will be. I tried a bit of my wife's classic bacon sandwich, which I'd only give 4 stars - it was good, but I agree with her, it's not *that* much better than basically the same sandwich, just with less expensive base ingredients, from any fast food place's breakfast menu, for several dollars cheaper. I would go out of my way to get the Fairfax, not so much for their other sandwiches.   And a solid 0 stars for a $5 biscuit, which just tasted like a biscuit. I told her it would, but she was like, no, I love biscuits, I bet theirs is amazing for that price. Nope, it was a good biscuit, but really, 5 bucks for just a regular sized pretty good biscuit?   They also apparently gave our order to someone else, so in exchange, after sending our order back to the front of the queue, they tossed in a free cookie, which was nice of them - the cookie was tasty enough, and clearly fresh, but again, nothing too special, certainly not worth $5.   So if I were to average everything we tried together, I'd probably have to give this place 3 stars. Luckily, I have total control and don't feel like doing that, because the Fairfax was too good. So just... don't get those other things, and get a Fairfax instead? :p",

I've been to the one in Los Angeles so I knew the food was going to be amazing, and it is definitely less crowded. Don't get me wrong, the line still wraps around the corner (especially during peak breakfast and lunch hours) but it's much calmer and organized than LA.  They have a fairly simple menu which makes it easier to decide what you want, and honestly I think all of it is perfect hangover food in Vegas. Or the perfect meal before going out to a dayclub.  I tried both the gaucho and the cheeseburger while I was there and it was a close tie between which one I liked more. But I'd had to say try the gaucho if you get the chance. The flavor is amazing and you can't find it everywhere.",

But after the raving reviews I've heard from a few people, I figure, why not give it a shot.  I tried their Fairfax sandwich, Buttermilk Biscuit, and orange juice. It was a little costly, especially their $5 orange juice, but it was so worth it. The Fairfax sandwich had a spicy mayo sauce to it that blended perfectly with the scrambled egg, cheese, and other yumminess mixed into the sandwich. The orange juice was definitely freshly squeezed, and naturally sweetened which so loved since it reminded me so much of my orange tree back home. The biscuit completed this meal since it was a perfect mix of salty and sweet.   The only negative thing I can say about this is that there aren't much places to sit and eat. But this is a place for a quick(ish) place to grab your food, eat, and head on your way, so be prepared!",

For Vegas the prices are reasonable and the quality of food and portions are on par with what you are paying. $8 for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and also $8 for the fairfax which is a breakfast sandwich with eggs cheese caramelized onions and Sriracha mayo, might be forgetting an ingredient here. Both sandwiches very high quality with fresh ingredients. The bread they use is fresh and very fluffy. I believe it comes from a local bakery. Also the name is fun, eggslut. Say it three times. It's Vegas so you can't really be offended. I wouldn't order juice or coffee here because it's way overpriced but great food, and then you can find a nice sofa at the Cosmo to sit on and enjoy! They have sofas near the chandelier bar nearby which aren't used in the morning. You will find people enjoying their sandwiches here. Just bring napkins!",

I came here on the second day since they opened so of course there would be a long line. Totally understandable. I would say it took us about a little over an hour from first arriving at the end of the line to finally getting our food. Was the line worth it? Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? No. No. No. It wasn't worth anything. I honestly felt like it wasn't anything spectacular. It was pretty much basic. For two people, I paid 43 bux for 2 damn sandwiches, 2 drinks, and a biscuit. And to find out that it all wasn't even all that great. Like seriously? You're better off going somewhere else to be honest. And I think the most annoying part is that I was still hungry! I still can't believe I paid that much over nothing. I don't know if this is just Vegas but I hear the one in LA is different but I wouldn't even risk going back again. Overall everything is just one giant nope for me.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a light and flavorful breakfast, you MUST come here. Even though it looks small, it's the perfect portion.  I ordered their specialty called the SLUT: cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. It was delicious, flavorful and just the perfect size. Yummy. It was very hot and seemed fresh made to order. I also ordered the buttermilk biscuit: house-made biscuit served with butter & maple syrup.  The biscuit was average and the butter was sweet (my kind of butter).  Eggslut seems like a very busy place regardless of their location because I've seen the line at the location in Downtown LA. This Eggslut location is inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. We got here around 11:00 am, there was a huge line, I'd say 20-30 minutes of a wait, so we left.  I really wanted to try it so we made sure we came back to our hotel at 3:00 pm, an hour before they closed.   This is a counter service style restaurant so....Unless you have no itinerary and are willing to stand in a long line, you probably should. If you don't want to wait, I suggest you do what I did and come right when it opens or before they close. I loved it and I can't wait to try other stuff on their menu, most likel the \"Fairfax\" or the \"Gaucho.\"  Enjoy!",

The perfectly creamy mashed potatoes under a perfectly cooked egg, stirred together and eaten with crispy slices of bread... WHO KNEW IT WOULD BE SO AMAZING??? Needless to say I'm a HUGE fan. (Oh I also had the honey butter biscuit which was good and a bacon breakfast sandwich which was sooo good but the Slut is the star here because it's so unique). I'll 100% be back next time I'm in Vegas.   Ps everyone who works here is SO SO friendly. Both times, the people who packaged my food to go did it with such care and with the biggest smiles on their faces, something so rare in customer service.",

Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, it's in a prime location right outside of Marquee and popular eateries Momofuku and Milk Bar. I ordered the turkey sausage, egg and cheese sandwich which is served on a fresh brioche bun and has a hint of honey mustard aioli. If you're looking for a quick, no-frills breakfast spot, this is the place. Beware that there could be a wait during peak times and there's limited bar seating at the actual restaurant. There's some open seating just outside the restaurant, but you better catch it before others take your spot waiting for their sandwiches.",

The slut was okay, kind of weird it was an egg on some type of mashed potato puree, in a tiny jar.

Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor so if you're checking this beautiful place out, then check out Eggslut as well or you're missing out on the whole Cosmopolitan experience. We went here for breakfast on a Tuesday and the line went around the corner. The line went by pretty quick though so don't let the long line fool you into not going. I got the sausage egg sandwich and the OJ. If you're dining there, there isn't much seating but seats turnover pretty quick so if you don't mind waiting or scouting out a few seats, you should eat there.  I know it's going to sound like an exaggeration but this breakfast sandwich was SO good. The first bite and you could taste all the flavors on your taste buds. I don't know what they put in these things, but it's freaking delicious. I don't know what more I can say about this. The sausage, the egg, the cheese, some type of mayo sauce and the bread. SO GOOD. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I'm sure. It keeps you full. I wasn't hungry until about a couple hours before dinner. The OJ was also good! I don't know what it is, but my time in Vegas, I was super dehydrated. The OJ definitely hit the spot and you can tell that it isn't artificial which is a plus .Definitely worth the time and money to go here if you haven't already!",

Be sure to pop the yoke and stir.  It's cute, and tasty. But not worth $10. Not even in Vegas.   If you want something more filling, consider their more traditional breakfast sandwiches.

    "text": "For a place whose namesake is in eggs, eggs didn't really feel like the centerpiece of each dish.  Even in the \"slut\" dish, their specialty, the potato puree and egg in a jar didn't really emphasize the egg.  Also, it was much too salty.  It just tasted like salty potato mash, and the occasional bit of chives offset the boring flavors.  Similarly, the egg in the sandwich was super thin (which can be a good thing) but again really struck me as contradictory to the store's name.  Overall, it was definitely not worth the money I paid, considering how small the portions were and how mediocre the food was.  I was puzzled at why there was such a long wait, but I guess many people were new to it like me and were wanting to try it.    Also, perhaps I should mention that the glass jars are the only dishes to be returned, the rest disposed.  Above the wastebasket was a platform for diners to return their glass jars.  The sign for this platform read \"We recycle our sluts. Return your glass jars here.\" (Not word for word)  I suppose this is appropriate for Las Vegas, but I'll leave it up to everyone to decide if this is funny, offensive, inappropriate for children, etc.  But I just thought I'd mention it.",

Not sure if I want to stand in line again for 25 mins from start to finish.    Well, for a hotel like this....(Cosmo) it's hard to find a $8.50 breakfast sandwich that is actually made-to-order!!!! So ultimately, if you have the time, why not?   If you like bacon, they are generous! The egg yolk literally dripped all over my hand....it was a truly sunny side up!",

First of all,the line is crazy so I recommend you to go as soon as they open or later on the day.  This place isn't cheap because of course is Vegas and second it's just breakfast sandwiches and egg products they serve. Don't get me wrong I love the concept and they have lots of products but when it comes to expectation of flavor I really expected a little bit more.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese and I just wasn't impressed of the flavor of the sausage.  My husband had the bacon, cheese and egg and he liked it.  The staff is very friendly and patient so props on that because mostly of the places I went to Vegas the staff was rude.  If you want to try it for the first time why not? Go for it! For the experience It's just not something I'll have next time I'll go.",

    "text": "So I'm including two pictures: one of the food, and one of the line. What, don't notice a line? BINGO!  Go to this place in LA and try getting out of there in under 30 minutes (looking at you Grand Central Market)...just try. Given that I only wait in line 30+ minutes for very few things in life -- and egg sandwiches are not one of them -- I'd never had one of these heavenly hyped sandos despite being in their orbit many times. That is until I happened across a line-less storefront at 330pm (30 min before closing on weekdays) the day after Christmas!   Look, these things are good. Really good, in fact. I had the Fairfax and Gaucho. Stick with the Fairfax. Wagyu hoity toity whatever Gaucho is fine, even good, but not what I was expecting, as it was basically overcooked meat (probably a requirement) with a token, overdone fried egg with some chimichurri sauce. If you just want a meat injection, Gaucho is for you; if you'd prefer to appreciate the subtleties of a good breakfast sando, go Fairfax (eggs, chives, cheddar, caramelized onions, spicy mayo). Anyone can mask goodness with a ton of ingredients (think: pizza), but to really tell quality, you need to get down to basics (think: margherita pizza), and that is exactly what the Fairfax is -- basic, fundamental goodness.   Thanks to the short line, I went back for round 2.",

The long lines every morning is evident of just how good this place is. We came at 9:10 in the morning and left an hour after that. I must give props to all the cooking staff at the back as the guy is managing maybe six different pans all at once cooking eggs.   The food is simply put, super simple but executed in the best way possible. I ordered the Fairfax with bacon which had the soft scrambled eggs with chives and a sriracha mayo. Eggs were delicious and texture was perfectly soft. I also ordered the Slut which is a jar with potato puree with an egg on top. Stir the jar up and slap it on the toast for a good time.   If you don't want to wait, come back around lunch time to avoid the morning rush. So worth it and so glad I checked this one off the list.",

I timed it and for a sunday around brunch, it was a 30 minute wait which apparently is not bad because I heard it can go for over 1+ hour.  Opted for the bacon egg and cheese sandwich (2) and the fresh OJ for $5. Honestly, for $5, it should be a large size and not medium, just saying. It was good though, but not enough lol. The sandwich was good but apparently it already has ketchup in it.. alotttt of ketchup which I thought was weird lol. Don't get me wrong.. I love ketchup but I'm more of a 'dipper' than having it already in my sandwich lol. Usually a breakfast sandwich would be plain or with mayonnaise but that's just my opinion. The brioche bun was soft and tasty and you can tell the workers are super busy but very efficient with each order. I was still hungry after though..   Would I come back? Maybe, but not waiting for over 30 minutes. I rather have a bacon egg and cheese waffle sandwich at Bruxie's (NYNY) which was way more fulfilling.",

So we got the Slut, basically egg mashed potato served in a little mason jar. It was alright, definitely not worth the hype nor the price ($11). We also got the biscuit, which is OK with the added sauce. The orange juice is definitely not worth it (the Mom Ami Gabi across the street has it for $4.5)",

Menu: It's not extensive like a Cheese Cake Factory but you won't come here if you're into that.

The Fairfax is a soft scramble egg sandwich with a tiny zing from the spiced mayo. The slut was delicious, even though I don't think it was worth $10.50. The Gaucho was meaty and the chimichurri sauce definitely elevated an ordinary sandwich. They have overpriced basic items that taste really good. It is worth trying.   People were envious of my breakfast at the airport! They asked where I got it.",

But it is also a very tasty egg sandwich, with some nice flavored mayo and caramelized onions enhancing the experience.  If you go, be ready for a long line--there is another LA comparison, lots of people. Lots. As in, 20 to 30 minute wait, line wrapped around.

    "text": "I was really exited to eat here. I was looking to improve my egg-cooking skills one day and came across a video on YouTube by the owner of Eggslut. He taught how he makes the Fairfax, and I make it all of the time now at home. But of course I wanted to try the real thing!  When we got there I was surprised to see that the line was HUGE! We waited for about 15 minutes maybe, so not too bad, but the length of the line is interesting. I guess there's a lot of hype about this place.  My girlfriend and I shared a fairfax and a slut. The fairfax is a sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo. I thought it was really good! But... just not quite knock your socks off good, which is what I was sort of expecting. It was really well done, but I think it could use some more flavor. The caramelized onions and sriracha mayo didn't really come through too much for me. I would have liked those flavors to come through a little more. And I love to use sour cream or creme fraiche, the cold is such a nice contrast to the warm eggs.  The slut is a poached egg on top of potato puree. It was listed as one of their two specialities, so I ordered it. I wasn't disappointed. The combination of the egg with the smooth pureed potato was really really awesome. I enjoyed the novelty. Props to them for the combo. However, I also think it could have used more flavor. The flavor was basically just fat and salt, it wasn't balanced by any spice or acid.  It's also worth noting that sizes were definitely small. Growing up in New York, I recall the gigantic bacon egg and cheese sandwiches I'd get at the bagel store. They were probably three times the size of Eggsluts sandwiches. My girlfriend and I were both slightly hungry afterwards, which is always disappointing. But I'm still glad we went.",

I heard so many stories about the long lines, so I was ready to wait in this massive line for this so called amazing breakfast sandwich. When I got to the restaurant there were only about 5-6 people in line. PERFECT.   I ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich (sausage is turkey sausage), Fairfax sandwich, and the egg salad sandwich. My family and I instantly inhaled our food. IT WAS SO GOOD. The bread was perfectly soft coated with a little butter and then TOASTED, the egg was perfectly cooked with cheese, and the turkey sausage was so juicy and flavorful. I was so satisfied! We all loved the sandwiches we got. I love how they have so many veg options, and they also let you replace the buns in your breakfast sandwich for lettuce for a healthier option!! How cool. I wish Houston had an Eggslut because it is that good!!   The only thing I wish was that they had more open seating for their restaurant. They only had around 4-5 tables with chairs in that designated area. There was a bar located right across the corridor, and they did not allow us to sit there. So finding a clean space to eat was a tad bit annoying.",

While the quality of the food is pretty good, the kitchen staff clearly were able to whip these breakfast sandwiches out much quicker than the cashiers could take the orders. After waiting and waiting to pay way too much for a tiny orange juice and sandwich I sat there thinking maybe I should have ordered a second sandwich. Too late! The sandwich was \"okay\" but the kitchen staff had piled up stacks of eggs, bacon, buns, etc. so what you're getting is not truly fresh. If I'm going to wait in line for that long I want it to be made to order, not pile ordered.",

    "text": "Wait time from 2nd poster to the cashier = 25 minutes. Wait time from ordering to receiving food = 8 minutes!!  VERDICT? Worth the wait AND lives up to the hype!   As a local, my reasons to come to the Strip are limited to work, a special event or visiting friends and family. Since the Cosmo now charges an unavoidable parking fee, this once favorite casino of mine sees a lot less of my patronage. But, when I was scheduled to work PAINWeek 2017 here, I made a point to build in some extra time to check out the hype.   I showed up at about 9:10am on a Friday and the line was wrapped around and down the hallway. But they've got a giant menu posted on that same wall, so be polite and decide what you'll order early!  I opted for The Slut (because, why wouldn't you?) which came in an adorably tiny glass mason jar. I appreciated that it came lidded, making it easy to take to-go. I also appreciated that they \"Recycle their Sluts\" (aka the jars,) although I kept mine!   I'd never had eggs prepared this way. It's a consistency similar to poached but fluffier, because they're cooked inside the glass jars in hot water. The woman who served it to me was awesome in asking if I'd had The Slut before and instructed me to \"mix the slut well...otherwise you'll just get salt and chives.\" ...good advice! The egg turns into a whipped butter consistency that you spread on your bread like butter (or dip, your preference!) and even though I ran out of bread, I ate the rest by the spoonful right out of the jar!   Honestly, the wait isn't any longer than at a sit-down restaurant. At one point, a single cashier was manning BOTH registers. Taking new orders on one while processing payment from the previous order on the other.   There's plenty of table/high-top seating if you choose to stay, but the food is just as easy to grab and go, if you don't! You can also rep an official \"Eggslut\" T-Shirt in Men's or fitted women's.   If you're not a morning person, find a friend who is and have them order for the crew. It's a breakfast worth waking (or staying) up for!",

I was intrigued when I saw Alvin Cailan on YouTube create a scrumptious looking breakfast sandwich featuring King's Hawaiian Bread, grilled Spam, egg and chives. It looked amazing!  Fast forward a year later, I heard that he opened another Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas. I specifically came here for \"The Slut\": an ingenious twist on a coddled egg, served over mashed potatoes, sprinkled with gray salt and chives. It's served up with a few thinly sliced baguette slices and is presented in a mini mason-esque jar. I loved this but the portion is ridiculously tiny! Regardless, I enjoyed it but for $10 for a teeny portion, I was expecting a bit more. Next time I will try one of the breakfast sandwiches as they looked a bit more substantial.  Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed, which bummed me out because I wanted to love this place.   I shall give the LA location another try...we'll see what happens!",

On a better note right out side of the chicken coop they have nice art work, unique chairs and table sitting, good music playing, and the huge chandelier great for a few pictures. The $9 egg cheese bacon sandwich was good but again small if you have a big appetite.

We arrived at the restaurant around 10 am, and not surprisingly, there was a line that wrapped around the hallway towards the restrooms. It was a quick 20 min wait until it was our turn to order. We ordered the highly recommended bacon egg and cheese sandwich and the slut. 10 minutes later and our food was ready for pickup. The first bites of the slut toasted egg/potato dip and bacon egg and cheese sandwich were mesmerizing. If you haven't tried this place yet, definitely check it out.",

Second, the brioche bun was soft and doughy; it could have been better on a quality biscuit or croissant. Third, the cheese was not melted on the sandwich, but may have been cheddar, although taste and texture-wise, it may as well have been Kraft American cheese. And fourth, the one thing that could have distinguished it from my normal home-cooked fare, the advertised Aieoli sauce, was virtually absent. I finally got a small taste with my last bite. It was promising. Judging by other reviews, perhaps they just screwed my sandwich up with extreme haste to produce volume. Burger Kings are busy, but produce a better product for under $3.",

Minus the fact that they up-charge like crazy for these sandwiches compared to their LA location, but I digress.  What really matters here is the accessibility of this Eggslut on the Strip. It's opened very early in the morning and is more affordable than a lot of other brunch spots in these mega hotels. You and your friends will truly see the late nighters coming out for a breakfast sandwich as the line wraps around at all hours of the day.  The sandwich is great for what it is. You got bacon, egg, and cheese all baked between two brioche buns. It got the job done really well and it didn't take long for us to get our food after we ordered.  So is it a welcome addition to the Vegas community? Absolutely, but don't expect it to be mind blowing either. Enjoy it for what its worth- a decent but delicious, slutty sandwich.",

I guess it's probably because I can make a pretty mean breakfast on my own at home already, so I tend not to eat our for breakfast or brunch as much.  Anyway, we made our way upstairs only to find a long line wrapping around the wall. Let me tell you people, the wait IS SO WORTH IT. I had the fairfax + avo + arugula with chimichuri on the side (so good!). It was a 45 min wait from the moment we went in line until the moment I heard the staff's voices call out my name that our order was finally ready! Seriously good breakfast sandwich. I think the soft and crispy brioche bread just makes it. I was told they have a location in Venice in LA also by our neighbors on the communal table.",

We almost left but decided to wait it out. Glad we did because it was bomb! My hubs declared it was the best! It was pretty damn good! $8.50 for a egg, sausage & cheese, $8.50 bacon, egg & cheese sandwich, and $10.50 for a slut! Okay, the slut was sooo good my daughter polished it off & wanted more bread to dip in. You have to mix the egg & potato goodness before dipping. The sandwiches were delish as well. I liked the sausage better but both were yum. How yum?!  We went back later for more! Yup, dinner at egg slut and no line! Must try, it's delish!",

No, our glutton-ness shame of just eating pizza did not deter us from getting in line. We've never tried Eggslut before and we're curious on how good the egg sandwich could be.  We ordered the classic, The Fairfax, and the Gaucho sandwich.  I'll start with the Gaucho. I thought this sandwich was alright. My friend and I thought there was too much arugula, very \"aruguly\" and the beef was nothing I'd write home about.  The Fairfax though, that was delicious. The eggs were creamy, the aioli was savory, the cheese was that dirty American cheese that you always want. The chives added a brightness and the caramelized onions were so dank. No other way to describe it than dank. Then the brioche bun holds all of it together in its warm embrace.  We also traded a slice of pizza for a bottle of water, I'd say they won that trade off but still gave off some good vibes.  I'd recommend the Fairfax to anyone!",

Choosing off reviews and pictures, I got the Slut and the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. The Slut is probably the most popular, but for the price, I don't think I'd get it again. The egg itself was really good and I would have never thought about adding a potato puree. The downside was that it came with three little pieces of toasted baguette. You'll definitely still feel hungry if that's all your getting. Luckily, I also had the sandwich. Nothing too fancy from your typical breakfast sandwich. I'm more satisfied with a McGriddle from Mickey D's. Meh.  It's something that you should check out if you've never had it, but it isn't something I'd wait 40 minutes for.

    "text": "The quality control of Eggslut in Las Vegas is abysmal. I ordered 2 Fairfax and a slut, and both sandwiches barely have any caramelized onions (barely a tablespoon), one has way too much mayo I couldn't taste the egg anymore, and the other barely has any mayo.  The Slut was way too saltier it's almost inedible, and the yolk is hard but the egg white barely solidified, I don't even know how the hell they achieved to screw that up during the water bath.  The quality is gross compared to what I'm used to LA. I feel bad for people who wasted time lining up only to be served with a shitty version of food that is good at the original branches.  If you're in Vegas, skip this sorry husk of the real thing and find food somewhere else.  Eggslut, please make sure you keep quality consistent in all your branches because this Vegas branch is incredibly disgusting",

The menu is right by the register and is simple enough for you to know exactly what you want. Atmosphere is modern and clean. The line was quick, however the time waiting for the food was a little slower than I'd expect. I ordered everything as takeout as well, but you can totally enjoy the meal at all the seating area near the restaurant. Ordered the cheeseburger ($10.50). Was expecting a little more wow factor, or maybe I had higher expectations, but overall it was average. Did hit the spot as I was quite hungry. Maybe I should've ordered something else.

    "text": "Saw all the rave reviews for both locations and had to check out Eggslut at the Cosmopolitan.   I had an overall average experience. Food was okay and the cost was expected so I was able to focus on the quality of my sandwich.  Arrived around 10 am and the line was ridiculously long so I decided to come back later around 2 pm after some shopping and there was no line!   Ordered The Fairfax with sausage and bacon.   The eggs were way too wet for a breakfast sandwich resulting in all the contents slithering out from between the brioche buns and making a huge gooey, greasy, cheesy mess. Brioche was too thick but flavorful and lightly sweetened. The bacon was decent and had a little fat to it. The hand pressed turkey sausage breakfast patty had a nice kick to it. I would stick to either bacon or sausage next time, not both, and make sure to get extra napkins. There is also a fancy sauce they put on that has a little punch to it as well. It is a big sandwich. You could definitely split one.   Coming back to try the Slut and possibly another sandwich to see if it's worthy of another star.  What I really like about Eggslut is the short menu. There are limited choices but I would order any of the sandwiches.",

Come before 11:30am as line can get long but it moves pretty fast with the assembly line style of making the ultimate breakfast sandwiches with a fried egg, cheese, bacon or sausage on a fresh bun of bread with house ketchup.

The chooses are a few egg sandwiches and their signature offering, the eggslut. I opted for the egg, cheddar and bacon sandwich on their brioche bun. There were almost as many workers as diners, which was impressive. With that many people, one might reasonably expect that the sandwich would arrive hot, but sadly this was not the case. A cold egg bacon and cheese thing is not to be envied. I'm not really sure how that even happens, considering how many folks were there and how fast they were serving the food. On top of that, it featured a chipotle ketchup, a thing I found neither necessary, nor a value add. I enjoyed he experience, but would not rush back. Oh, the freshly squeezed OJ was wonderful.",

    "text": "A visit to Eggslut while in Vegas (or at any of their locations, really) is a must! The Fairfax sandwich + bacon + avo - grilled onions is my go-to, with a Slut on the side. Yes, it might seem overwhelming at first, but just believe me that you cannot leave without trying the Slut. Stir everything up and eat it by itself, or with the baguette, or smother it all over your Fairfax. You simply can't go wrong -- unless you don't order it at all, and that's just plain preposterous!  Some tips: - The line can get long, but that's with any place in Vegas. Go a little early, like around 8AM, to catch breakfast and the line won't be wrapped around the corner and back up again. - Seating is limited. Go with a party of 4 or less, unless you don't mind not being seated together. There are also Cosmo couches, but I would recommend sitting at a table to scarf everything down. - Skip on the OJ; it's not worth $5 imo. - You also cannot get a cup of water here, so bring your own bottle. I carried around a bottle of ice water to stay hydrated in the 100+ degree weather anyway, so that didn't bother me. - After enjoying your Slut, remember to return the glass jar on the wall by the pick-up area!",

By far the best Item on the menu. Ask for extra baguette and add a side of bacon if you need a meat item.",

Tried the sausage sandwich, which was somewhat disappointing.  I was expecting a fluffy egg like prior but it was just a regular sunny side egg.  The bread was good as usual.  Next time, i'll stick to the Fairfax.  There was also quite a wait after ordering to receive your food, which was not unexpected as they are made fresh and to order.  Seating is hard to find so you'll probably end up sitting near the bar/common seating area or getting it to go.",

They were good but honestly I did not see anything exceptional here. I actually turned my sandwich into a salad which the portion of lettuce was very small. They also serve your food like a fast food joint shouting your order number. I would probably recommend this place if you are on the run and need something to go like a fast food joint, but don't expect to sit or have an experience. Look for other options in the Cosmo for that.",

I'm not a fan of this place, it's over overpriced even for Vegas and not really any better then Jack n box breakfast sandwich that you can get for under $5! Don't get me wrong its not horrible but i just didn't leave going wow this is amazing. The size of the sandwich left me hungry. The line was ridiculous long 15-20 min wrapping around corner probably more cause of the hype. Plus the wait varied all 3 of us ordered 1 after other and there was a 5-7 min difference in order being ready. The kitchen appears to be efficient but its not. Skip it save yourself $10 and go to Jack n Box off strip. But if you want to improve reduce the cost of the sandwich a buck or two or offer a side of hash browns and work on the efficiency of the kitchen, you have eggs, bacon, sausage ready i saw them. Work on getting the orders out faster and the line moving quicker.",

It gets busy in the morning and probably after clubbing since it is right across from Marquee but I went at an odd hour and was 3rd in line. I ordered the Slut, which like the other locations, is whipped potatoes topped with a soft boiled egg with a side of toast. I felt that the Slut was better than the one I had in LA. The potato to egg ratio felt right and you can taste the richness of the egg more in this version. I downed the dish in amount 5 minutes and although pricey, it's a meal to treat yourself with in the morning. I would definitely not suggest this particular dish for an after-clubbing meal. You need more sustenance than this... Go for the sandwiches after the club. I was very happy with my meal and I would definitely go back.",

The food isn't bad but honestly my 3 dollar B.E.C from Any Brooklyn corner store is better then there B.E.C. The line was super long, we waited about 30 mins just to order. If your staying on the strip and your a fan of breakfast sandwiches then you should definitely try it and see for yourself but to me it wasn't to my liking....   3.5 Stars for the Music #SuperLitPlaylist  1 star for my B.E.C (the buns/bread)",

Anyways, the first time I ate it was in LA and I tried the Fairfax sandwich, which was a soft scrambled egg, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun.  This was very delicious and the texture of the egg was just so velvety.  I would pay $8.50 for this.  I also tried the infamous \"Slut\" which was a coddled egg over a buttery potato puree, served with bread.  Yes, this was good... BUT, how can you go wrong with buttery mashed potatoes and en egg on top though?  I wouldn't pay for this ($10.50?!)  In Vegas, I tried the Gaucho, and OMG, my opinion about this place completely changed.  It was basically seared wagyu tri-tip steak, over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun.  This is definitely a must try!!!  It was just so damn good.  It is expensive though at $15... but so worth it.  I don't know if I would wait in a hour+ line for breakfast sandwiches... but maybe next time I'll just ask some randoms at the front of the line to buy the sandwich for me and tip them... haha",

I just went with a simple egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich with a biscuit on the side. The sandwich was wonderful, but the biscuit was a bit dry for my taste.

    "text": "After staying in the cosmopolitan for a for days I witnessed a repeated event; HUGE lines at Eggslut!  I wanted to go each day but the lines were really long and the wait extended past endless it seemed. So, at lunch hour I trekked into a blissful line-less experience. Almost instantly I was ordering and it felt like a dream.  I ordered up the GAUCHO, which per the menu was wagyu steak, over medium egg, chimichurri and red onions in a handsome bun.   I patiently waited an few minutes and selected a table. The seating at the cafe is limited so additional tables are in the main hall area. This area is dressed in a theme resembling Alice n' Wonderland including a chair with giant bunny ears.   In short order the sandwich came and it was tasty, but not rock this world tasty, just tasty.   I would return only when the line is not gargantuan.    Enjoy!",

First you order your food, then you have to stand around for them to call your name, then hope you can find a seat. Is it worth it? hell yes! I had the Fairfax Sandwich (Cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) that I added Bacon too. Oh my goodness it was amazing. I never thought I'd be that excited about an egg sandwich. Add in the stylish decor, huge light fixture made from mixer beaters, and some awesome tunes and it was a great place to start our last day in Vegas.",

We arrived about 9am one morning, and still were very far-- but waited roughly 20 minutes to order, which wasn't so bad.   The menu options are simple: bacon egg and cheese, homemade-sausage egg and cheese, a burger, a steak option, and regular egg and cheese. They have an egg over easy dish and biscuits, but neither looked appetizing to me.   Our group ordered a couple bacon egg and cheeses and sausage and cheeses, and WOW. This was really the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a very long time, and possibly ever. The turkey sausage was homemade and very well done. Super flavorful. The bacon egg and cheese had a ketchup type sauce on it that had a good bite. Totally 5 star worthy. The service is pretty fast and kind too.   The only draw back is don't arrive thirsty-- this is Vegas. A bottle of water will cost you $5, and fresh squeezed orange juice is like $5-8. Also, seating gets tight when it gets busy, so consider taking our sandwich on a still on the strip!",

I love the fresh squeezed OJ they have, the slut is a major hit, and the sausage sandwich on the brioche bun. So to describe what the slut actually is since the name sounds a little sketchy lol it is a coddled egg with mashed potatoes garnished with chives that you spread on freshly toasted sour dough slices I promise u although it sounds so simple it is very delicious a for sure must try. The presentation is also interesting because it comes in a small little jar prepped as you order. There are only a few locations so be sure to take advantage while you are in Vegas. Plus after a night out on the town in Vegas it's guaranteed to hit the spot.",

The gaucho's meat was prepared and seasoned very well. The slut was interesting. It seemed like a poached egg with mashed potatoes on the bottom, but it was definitely good.   Having 11 people in the party, we ordered around $400 of food and the food came out surprisingly fast. The staff was friendly and tried to accommodate us as best as possible.

All the staff I saw were moving/working fast & efficiently, in fact the cook/prep area seem to function as a well oiled machine the whole time I watched them.   Now the important stuff.....I had the \"Fairfax\" with bacon and avocado added.  It was the right amount of food for a good breakfast.  I spent about $15..... It nearly blew my mind that I was spending that much on basically an egg sandwich...... BUT, it turned out to be very possibly the absolutely BEST EGG SANDWICH that I have ever eaten! It was nearly egg sandwich perfection. Well worth every penny it cost.   On top of the that, even though they were clearly very busy, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and customer centered.  You could tell that they clearly enjoyed their jobs and like the crowds of customers.    Overall a really great breakfast experience in Vegas.  FYI - the place is a little difficult to find, it is in the shops on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Casino.",

We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before hopping on the plane and while I was in favor of Earl of Sandwich in our hotel, hubby wanted to try out Eggslut as it had been on his list for a while. When we arrived, I ran to secure seats and hubby hopped in the semi-long line which was growing by the minute. I honestly thought the menu was more exhaustive judging by the thousands of pics on Yelp but it was pretty straightforward with about 15 items total (including drinks).  I went for the sausage/egg/cheese, hubby got the cheeseburger, and our friend ordered the Gaucho. Our friend and I agreed that our food was pretty average, especially for the price (pricing is on par with other popular Vegas spots) but hubby was loving his burger... he was committed and was going to hold on to hope. I will say that the medium fried egg and aioli was pretty different for your typical SEC sandwich and the bread was pretty quality. I can't say that I would rush back to this place though. By the way, the beverages are highly upcharged in my opinion - $5 for a can of soda or 12 oz of orange juice is kinda ridiculous.",

But what they done is made sure that each of those elements is fantastic. And that's how you make a great breakfast sandwich.",

You stand in line, order, and wait for your order to come to the pick-up counter. There's not a ton of seating in the actual restaurant, but there is seating around the area within the hotel where you can sit. We lucked out and actually sat inside, but it's a really casual vibe.   Eggslut offers egg sandwiches, specialties, and sides. I opted for The Fairfax, which is soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun. It was seriously one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever had. I highly recommend it!  B got the Cheeseburger, which was a ground Angus beef burger, an over medium egg, caramelized onions, bread and butter pickles, cheddar cheese, and dijonnaise in a brioche bun. I wasn't sure about this one... a cheeseburger, for breakfast? But, I tried a bite and it was really tasty!  If you're in the area and you're looking for a great casual breakfast/brunch spot I definitely recommend Eggslut! It's great!",

I got the bacon and egg sandwich without the cheese.  My friend got the Slut.  The bacon and egg sandwich was pretty good but was kinda small.  I like the sweetness of the sandwich though.  My friend said the slut was salty and not what was expected.  She was hungry but that didn't fill her up.  It's just couple pieces of small breads and small glass jar of egg and potato spread.  The slut is more like a snack than a meal.  Maybe we got the wrong items.  Nothing to rave about.  They weren't up the hype.  Prices are high but it's Vegas.  Services were ok.",

The only problem for me is honestly I can eat 3 of these to be full and I would say I'm average portion breakfast eater. So the value just isn't there. But if you got the coin go ahead and grab a few. It's Vegas so I guess your going to spend it somewhere anyways.   We got the Bacon, Egg and Cheese and a Fairfax and split them both. While both were good Me and Wifey both agree the Bacon Egg and Cheese is the Clear Winner. Meat over double egg all day. It clearly wasn't a fair fight.",

The best part of the sandwich was the bread used. The bread is very moist and light. The eggs were cooked just fine. I was given the option to specify if I wanted it fried hard or wet. Can't go wrong with that. The sausage was very dry but it's turkey and I get it. The sausage was seasoned well and had a nice flavor to it. The cheese was cheese. Again, the sandwich was just okay. I also got a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was very dry and hard. It was not flaky or anything like that. It was just a hard biscuit. The best part and what made the biscuit better was the honey butter. It took the biscuit from a 2 to a 7. The butter is quite thick but it's not bad. I personally would never get another biscuit from here again. I think coming here at least once is good for the experience but, I would not go out of my way to return here.",

Maybe it's the trendy name or so many people want to justify the wait.  The food however just felt and tasted plain. The ratio of bread to filling was too thick and egg was cooked to over hard in their sandwich. Their specialty the \"slut\" was a tasty for first 2 bites but potatoes and bread lacked other components that could have made great like, something crunchy or salty to keep you going for more.   Glad I was able to see what the hype was about but wouldn't be back again with all the other food choices on the strip.",

I came around 11:15 AM which is a prime breakfast time and the line was wrapped way around the corner. The line moved quickly and took about 20 minutes to order, but waiting for food was a different story.  I ordered The Slut which is a potato puree in a jar with and egg on top, served with french bread. Since The Slut was essentially premade, it took literally 2 minutes to receive. My friend on the other hand ordered a burger and sandwich which took another 20 minutes or so to get.  The flavor is definitely 5/5 in the slut, but I found it to be too small of a serving and not worth the wait of the line. Would definitely return if the line was short though!",

The eggs are English eggs to die for, super creamy and also fall apart in your mouth.   I ordered the fair fax and added avocado, best choice I ever made. It made the sandwich so much more creamy and fluffy, but the bacon gave it a really great crunch that contrasts all the softness. Onions, if you like them, also a great idea to add texture.   One is pretty big and filling for me but if you have an appetite like my boyfriend, you're probably going to want another one or just do what he did and eat half of mine LOL",

At first I was skeptical and thought, how good can an egg sandwich be?  I couldn't have been more wrong.  After my first sandwich, I woke up the next day at 6am craving another.  I sat and waited until they opened to get it again.  They are that good.  I only had the Fairfax, as I couldn't see myself getting something different with how amazing this sandwich was.  The sandwich comes with fluffy scrambled eggs, chives, carmelized onions, cheddar, and siracha mayo.  I added bacon to mine to give it a little more texture the second time and it was even better.  The thing that really puts these sandwiches over the top is the delicious brioche buns they use.  Buttery and fresh, it is just perfect.  It is also a really fun experience to go here and wait for your sandwich.  While it can take some time, you get to watch the assembly line style process that goes into making all of the sandwiches.  I would definitely say this is a must stop for breakfast when in Vegas.",

However, the bacon was crispy but did not have much flavor to it. The egg also did not taste freshly cooked but warmed up on the grill.

The amount of time it takes to get the sandwich you think they are waiting for chicken to hatch the egg 1st.  It's a perfectly fine sandwich and there really isn't much to say about bacon egg and cheese. My only knock on the place was the fact that the bun definitely was past it's prime and started to get that tough outer staleness that bread gets after being out all day.

It's cool to see how they prepare your food in the back because of the open kitchen. There are also cute egg chairs to sit and enjoy your meal! We had the eggsalad sandwich and thought it was good but could have used more eggsalad filling. The taste was great though. You can tell their ingredients are high quality. The bread bun was not soft either and was a bit dry. We also ordered the eggslut special. I imagined it to be larger but it's really the size of a side dish. But the texture of the potato was so yummy. Overall, I kind of expected more from this place because of all the hype. I don't think I'd be willing to wait in that line again because it wasn't to die for. But if there's a shorter line next time, I'll definitely try out more off their menu.",

Wow, the line is long, and they only open one register to take order, we wait for about 30 minutes to order, then another 30 minutes to get the food! I wish that they can make things more efficient. The cook is trying their best (we can see the way they cook, there is no way that they can speed things up), they need another one or two grill to cook the sandwich. One grill is simply not enough.   So if you are planning to go, take it easy and wait. The food comes out in batches. Once all the sandwiches in that batches gone, you have to wait for them to cook another batch, and that may take 10 minutes.",

I can't wait to get back west to try this spot again!",

We were chicken and ordered the bacon,egg, & cheese sandwich along with the buttermilk biscuit. CARBS FOREVER!!!! I considered trying the Slut but I was starving and if that was my only choice and I didn't like it, this review could have been much worse.  The sandwich was tasty for sure. The bacon has a little bit of a smoky flavor which I loved and that ketchup was a perfect twist for a breaky sandwich! The biscuits was super dense! Make sure you get something to wash it down with bc it's not to be played with; however, it was good. And the fact that it was so dense let's me know that it was surely handmade! Delicious for sure, but both items could have been hotter. My sandwich was barely luke warm, and the biscuit could have kicked some butt if it was hot.  The \"honey butter\" really is more butter than honey. A little switch up could be some nice fruit flavored jam or something to mix all the savory with a bit of sweet. Now the orange juice was perfect! Freshly squeezed right out of the orange peel!",

Nothing special about it, but made to order and quite good for breakfast. The second visit I had the slut which was a coddled egg on potato puree which was absolutely delicious. They serve it in a glass jar which I felt was wasteful to the environment with no place to recycle the glass jars... I had a chocolate cookie here which was amazing... they give a lot of paper and plastic with each order. I brought back a bag full of utensils, napkins etc that we never used and the guy said I was the first to ever do that... I'm from Canada and we are heavily into recycling! Love this place, worth the wait!",

You could tell they run things VERY efficiently. I got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and even though the menu says the the egg is cooked one way, you can request another.

    "text": "The egg slut, just okay, not a big deal IMO.   The egg is one of my favorite foods so it's pretty possible that I may be more critical about the definition of a perfectly poached egg than most. BUT the egg slut didn't really wow me.  Positives: The idea is somewhat novel and exciting to receive a meal in a little jar and it IS fun to spread potato and egg gooeyness on toast!   The flavor of the potato and egg spread across the top of a crostini was satisfying and not too heavy. I enjoyed the savory and light potato and the mustard aioli.   Negatives: The egg was slightly over done (I thought to myself, this egg slut is NOT slutty ENOUGH!) and this item is overpriced for what it is. I love a beautifully runny and creamy yolk and when you've got something simple like this you have to nail it, which they didn't.   The yolk was just slightly over that threshold of creamy perfection. It was close but no cigar! Maybe if you are not into a runny egg this texture would be considered perfect for you?   Still a fun first time novelty to experience drunkenly out of the club. Maybe next time I will opt for one of the many egg sandwiches before I say that I won't be back, keep an open mind!",

My friend and I had Eggslut as one of the top spots on our list of places to try while in Vegas.   It does tend to get very long lines but rest assured that lines move fairly quickly. My first visit I went with the fairfax sandwich and added avocado. It was DELICIOUS. Possibly one of the greatest breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The eggs weren't over cooked at all and it had tons of flavor. That siracha mayo is bomb! Our second visit I went with the sausage, egg, and cheese in a effort to switch it up. While it was still very good it definitely wasn't as delicious as the fairfax.   I have been recommending eggslut to anyone I can, so to all of you on yelp who are reading this...I recommend it to you as well!",

    "text": "Not sure if it was the name, but there is something compelling about Eggslut that just warrant a visit. The menu is deceptively simple, but everything we had was so delish!   Situated on the second floor of Cosmopolitan Boulevard tower, more precisely next to Momofuku. Immensely popular, I made an effort to get here at 8 a.m. and was greeted with a pretty intimidating line, but thankfully it moves faster than what I had anticipated.    Fairfax: Their signature sandwich for a reason! The egg was fluffy, the seasoning of chives, salt and caramelized onions was well balanced and the buns is definitely the charm for me. It was so pillowy soft and warm. I did add bacon for that extra texture of crispiness. Absolutely scrumptious!   Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich: You cannot go wrong with bacon, egg and cheese - the combination is simply satisfying. The sunny side up melts just right with the buns. I enjoyed the play of flavors and the generous bacon add a good dose of texture.    Slut: The potato puree was creamy soft and seasoned nicely while the egg on top was just a dream. The slut comes with slices of baguette for a lil' bit of crunchy texture on the side. Although, I found the best way to enjoy this dish is to mixed it with the biscuits ($5 a piece) instead.  Overall, I had an egg-cellent first encounter at Eggslut. Beautiful location, delicious and creative execution are some of the reasons the Eggslut worth the try. Will definitely revisit when I'm back in Vegas :)",

The breakfast burger was always cooked perfect and their service was speedy. I came early when they first opened and saw them prep every thing from start to finish. I think that's what I liked about this place.. everything is cooked fresh. It was a bit pricey but if you're staying at the Cosmo then every place is a bit pricey. Plus your paying for quality food. Nothing sitting under a heat lamp or getting microwaved. I stuck to my breakfast burger for the most part.   I would encourage people to try this place on a weekday if possible. Thursday-Sunday this place gets extremely long lines. During the week I didn't really have to wait in line at all.",

    "text": "Decent, wasn't crazy about the wait though. I'd rather have gone to a buffet. Prices are decently high, and if you eat a lot I'd suggest against it. There wasn't really anything in this that wow'ed me which might be due to how much friends had hyped up the place, but also just the richness that I had wanted from the egg slut and the fluffiness of the eggs in the fairfax just weren't really there. The wait time was roughly 35 mins, and wait for food was roughly 15 to 20 since they were behind on egg sluts at the time.   So yeah, I had ordered the egg slut and the fairfax with avocado. I probably should have gotten the spicy mayo on the side to bolster things in retrospect. The fairfax was decent with the avocado, the spicy mayo didn't pop as much as I wanted. The carmelized onion was few and far between in the sammich. Balance thrown out the window for speed. Subbed ketchup eventually instead to curb the taste as a whole. The egg slut was also kinda nifty, but the mash wasn't as rich as I'd like at the bottom.  Overall, not crazy about the place. I'll stick to brunch or a buffet next time I'm in the area and in recovery mode.",

I'm not going to lie the line almost made me change my plans please listen to me the line moves really fast do not be scared I almost effed up royally.  I knew I was going to go with the fair fax because that is the dish I saw Chef Cailan making on Facebook my wife had the egg slut (coddled egg with mashed potato and bread) more on that in a min. Here is the lowdown 1. Fairfax sandwich (had mine with bacon) delicious perfect egg nice cheese amazing bun but really egg sandwiches are either good or not  2. The egg slut OMG this was amazing while I was very happy with my fairfax I was pretty jealous of my wife's mix the egg up with the potato and it makes this custard like sauce to spread over the bread that is so good we went the next day so I could get my own and I will now be trying to make this at home. 3. Orange juice delicious with perfect amount of pulp  Eggslut please please come to my home town of Denver  *pro tip the food court in Caesar's palace has choulula packets smuggled a few over for my slut I'm just saying",

I was so close and just needed to muster enough patience to stand in line as I anxiously inched closer yet so close but seemingly so far.  The decor was pretty cool they had whisks for light fixtures...  Alas! We finally made it to cashier to place our order but now we'd have to wait a bit more to get our food.  Starring at the cooks in their stations piling and assembling orders like clockwork as hungry patrons like myself stand by waiting for our name to be called.  It's packed and you'd be lucky to find a place to sit. We finally get our order.  The fair fax is just a creamy buttery scrambled eggs wedged in between some gooey cheese and bread.  It's immediately devoured.  In hindsight, I should have added a sausage patty, but it was still good nonetheless...",

Very annoying to get to the cosmopolitan/this restaurant unless you're staying there and now the charge parking down at all the hotels and casinos, so be prepared. Maybe uber or use lyft.  Seating is limited so you might want to take it to-go or sit in the areas around the chandelier bar.  The Gaucho was tri tip beef (mid-rare) with chimichurri, an egg, arugula and red onions. For $15 I was happy. It was on a luxurious brioche roll: it was perfect.  My husband liked his burger for $10 but was not that impressed with the quality of the burger.  It's a funny name for a restaurant and when you eat your sandwich, it's quite graphic. The eggs explode while biting into your sandwich which are double-wrapped. Don't wear white. Bring hand wipes.   The coffee is $5 and is gross. I don't know if it's burnt or what, but it's overpriced and not worth it.",

I can understand the appeal when you're drunk and a sloppy sandwich is just what the doctor ordered.   I got a bacon egg and cheese sandwich ($8) and because we're food tourists we shared their namesake \"the slut\" ($10) and the salted chocolate chip cookie. ($4.50)  The brioche was stiff and cold and the ketchup on the egg sandwich gave it that oddly distinctive McDonald's flavor.   \"the slut\" was a disappointment too as it was really just a lot of potatoes. The coddled egg itself was good as was the toast but it didn't save the meal. Great in theory but bad in execution.   Honestly, the real highlight was the cookie. If you're still reading and you've decided that you're still going to eat at Eggslut, get the cookie. It's crunchy and delicious.",

The sandwich itself was a bit spicier then expected with the sriracha which was fine with me, the spicier the better. What I didn't love about it was that the eggs seemed quite greasy which was unexpected. The brioche roll really added to the sandwich as a whole and while you can opt to go sans roll the roll really is a perfect addition. Speaking of additions. You can add on bacon, turkey bacon or avocado to many of the sandwiches, for a cost of course.  I also though that they were really thoughtful and made the atmosphere cohesive with the food served. Whisk light fixture, chicken footprints on the floor, cracked egg chairs and tile resembling chicken wire on the walls all awesome totally appropriate touches for their cuisine. A lot of people seemed to be deterred by the line, but in my experience the line moved quickly. There were roughly 10-15 people ahead of me in line when I arrived around 9am and I made it through the line, ordered and was eating my sandwich within 18 minutes.  Four stars because of the price and getting people with the steep price of add ons as well as the slightly greasy nature of the eggs.",

    "text": "Egg slut! Yes please! I come to Vegas twice a year I always stay at the cosmopolitan.  The one thing that was lacking was a amazing breakfast spot.  I was soooo excited when my promoter told me they put egg slut in.   Just so everyone knows these egg sandwiches are a step above traditional. I'm from NY I eat a bacon egg and cheese 2 times a week. The egg sandwiches at egg slut are like a gourmet version. Not sacrificing the speedy service.   Anytime between 8am and 11am there will be a line around the corner. One morning I waited over 30 mins for a sandwich (not joking). There was that many people in line. You can not make reservations or call ahead. I did find out. If you are VIP at the cosmo. They will get your sandwiches for you. Of coarse on the last day.   The menu is not huge. Egg slut only offers a few sandwiches. The eggs are cage free organic from a local farm. So is the bacon. The bacon egg and cheese is $8 this comes on brioche bun and with chipotle ketchup. The fairfax. Is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramalizes onions and siracha mayo.  Sooo fricken good. But the simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time. This place does some business. Turn over is quick.   The only complaints I have. There are only a few seats and there bar style. I wouldn't want to eat in here it's too loud. I would bring it to my room 95% of the people were grabbing here food and leavening. The second issue is after you place your order. You have to walk all the way to the other end to pick the order up. You walk through the restaurant to get to the pick up area. Then you have like no place to stand. There's a bunch of people standing waiting for there food. Blocking other people. It was interesting. The one day it was so crowded in the pick up area. I waited outside the restaurant. Behind the bar seating. I couldent hear the girl calling my name. Some guy asked me if I was josh cause my order was ready. It was kinda funny.   Overall. Egg slut is a much needed addition to the cosmo. I love this place. Great breakfast spot I highly recommend coming here. I will continue coming here every morning I'm at the cosmo. There solid and consistent.",

I remember not being completely blown away, mainly because of the huge line and the high price for what it is.  Vegas is pretty much no different EXCEPT that it's Vegas and everything is pretty overpriced, so that makes the higher prices of Eggslut kiiiind of okay. We were looking for a quick late night bite, and lucky for us, Eggslut is open at all hours of the night. We arrived around 2AM and were surprised to only find a short line of about 3 people. (We thought the post-club crazies would be everywhere.)  We ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and the Fairfax. If I were you, I would go straight for the Fairfax and add some bacon to go along with it. The eggs are super fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The bacon, egg, and cheese is exactly what it sounds like, but I wasn't a huge fan. (Major props to this sandwich for the runny egg porn, though.)  Quick and easy bites, even better if you're craving something late at night or post-clubbing.",

Turns out I was delighted to eat it as well. The scrambled eggs were rich and delicious with fresh chives. The bacon was cooked beautifully. The brioche really seals the deal on excellence. Overall it's a completely delicious sandwich in every way.  Only downside (not the food): 11:30AM on a Friday and the line was something like 30 people deep. So we had to wait a few minutes to order. This isn't a deal breaker but it also isn't my favorite thing. I guess it's the nature of eating in trendy spots.",

I was happy to see that this place is not busy at all and we ordered painlessly.   I got the Fairfax, the eggs were cold, the sandwich itself was overly salty, I actually added the arugula salad on top of it to sort of counter the saltiness of the bacon I added. It really was the coldness of the egg that ruined the sandwich. It was cold, soggy, and tasted uncooked. No, I would not try a different sandwich here, I won't even try to Los Angeles location. I can make a better breakfast sandwich for far less money.",

Came to the LV location inside the Cosmo hotel for breakfast. Got in line around 945AM and it was already wrapped around but we noticed it moved quickly. After about 15-20 min we ordered. Gaucho sounded great so that's what I ordered. The egg was cooked perfectly and the beef inside the sandwich was well marinated. You could actually taste the salt/pepper and other spices on the beef. The bread was something I had never tasted before but sort of a croissant/bagel as it was fluffy like a croissant but not greasy.   Service was good food was amazing... only 1 problem, there's no location in/around/near Washington DC",

    "text": "For my Vegas trip over the weekend, my friends and I stayed really close to the Cosmo, so of course when we found out there was an Eggslut here (I had heard of the LA location), we *had* to come and check it out!  We came for lunch on Sunday and then I came back again by myself right before my early Tuesday morning. But before I get into the food, let's get some details out of the way.  Location: Cosmo is huge, so it's pretty easy to get lost looking for Eggslut. It's closer to the east side of the hotel and grouped together with other restaurants and eateries. It's on the SECOND floor, not the third, and directly across from the main entrance of Marquee (the main club in Cosmo). If you follow signs for either the restaurant area or Marquee, then you should be able to find Eggslut pretty easily.  Hours: This Eggslut has some weird hours, so make sure you check that before going. I noticed over the weekend that they were open Sat and Sun from midnight till 7 pm, so I assumed they would have similar hours throughout the week. But nope, these hours are only for Tuesday (so random!) in addition to Sat/Sun. They close everyday at 7 pm though, so come early if you want to grab dinner here!  Lines: This place is popular, but the lines all really depend on when you come. The first time when we came around 11:15 on a Sunday, we ended up waiting in line for about an hour before it was our turn to order. The second time I came was around 1:30 am on a Tuesday after hitting up Marquee, and at this time there was practically no line. So if you're planning to come at peak lunch times, definitely expect a long wait.  Seating: There is very limited seating within the restaurant area itself. A lot of people either took their orders to go or sat down at the nearby hotel couches to eat. Just keep in mind this is more of a casual dining spot, not a fancy sit down restaurant with full service.  Food: I tried both the sausage and egg sandwich as well as the Fairfax with the sausage addition and thoroughly enjoyed both. The warm brioche bun went along great with the egg and the sausage. My friends all ordered one of the two, and for a while there was zero talking as we were all too busy savoring the deliciousness of the sandwiches. Now that's how you know the food is good! :)   I also tried the signature side dish, the slut, but I was much less impressed with that. It's essentially a sous vied egg + potato puree served in a glass jar with 3 small baguette slices. After I mixed the sous vied egg and potato puree together in the jar, I could not taste the egg at all, only the potato puree. You're supposed to use it as a spread on the baguette slices, but the puree was too salty and there just wasn't enough baguette slices to go with it. I don't understand how this side dish is so pricey, but I would not recommend unless you really want to give into the hype.  Price: Eggslut definitely is on the pricey side, though I think their sandwiches are worth it. Eight dollars for the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich seems reasonable, especially given Vegas prices. However, the signature dish, the slut, was not worth the $10 I paid for it.",

    "text": "Loved it!    We stayed in Vegas for 3 nights, and we came to Eggslut 3 times, that is how much my picky husband loved Eggslut.  It helped that we were staying in the East tower of Cosmo, because it was literally just down the elevator ride, but I'm sure we would've made the effort to come here anyways.  Wait:  if you come around 9 or before, the wait is pretty short.  We waited maybe 15 min?  Once it was past 9am, I noticed it got really busy and it died down again later in the day.   Service:  the gentleman at the counter was the same man all 3 days, and he was nice and helpful.  There was a lady calling out people once the food was made, and she was very sweet too.  She tried to find us extra chairs so we could enjoy the food at the communal table.  Food:  Delicious!  The brioche bun was so soft and thick.  We had everything from the Slut, to egg/bacon/cheese sandwich, to Gaucho to Fairfax.  We loved Fairfax, but it can get messy.  Be sure to add avocado for this.  We also loved Slut, which is a little salty, but it's perfect when you eat it with bread.  The potato+poached egg pairing is so creamy and delicious.  I even love their simple arugula salad.  The only one we didn't like so much was their turkey sausage.  I wasn't a fan of that.  Price:  A little pricier than Shake Shack, but so much better in my opinion.  I'd rather come here and spend a few extra dollars... it's Vegas, you can't enjoy Vegas if you're worried about a few extra bucks.    I'd definitely come back again.  In fact, we are thinking we will always stay at Cosmo because it was so convenient.  Nothing like strolling out of bed, picking up some good food, and lounging around back in your room without having to set your foot outside in the Vegas heat.  Recommend!",

The line was long around mid morning/early lunch but passing thru just before closing was the perfect opportunity to do breakfast for dinner. No lines or crowds to speak of in the evening.  My visit was more like a pre-dinner appetizer since there were so many other places I wanted to visit in such a short amount of time. Just be aware they close at 7pm.  Very limited seating, all communal style. And there is nowhere to sit in the immediate vicinity if it's crowded so you might wanna be prepared to take it to-go. Finding a seat near the Chandelier bar just seems awkward to me.  Since it was close to closing I scored extra toast for my slut. It was just the right amount for this carboholic. The silken coddled egg was perfectly seasoned with gray salt & beneath that was a layer of buttery potato goodness so no complaints from me. Wish I could try everything on the menu here so I'll have to return again.",

For the last few years, I've been getting breakfast from Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood, so I welcome having Eggslut just across the street at The Cosmopolitan as an alternative.  Earl's tends to slightly burn their buns, whereas Eggslut's brioche buns are bigger and better.  I recommend THE FAIRFAX ($8). Although it's a breakfast sandwich, it comes with a fork, because it can get really, ahem, loose and messy with soft scrambled eggs and other ingredients (such as sriracha mayo, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions) coming out of it. I also added avocado ($2). This sandwich doesn't blow me...away (nor do I expect that), but it's packed with flavors and it's nice to have another quick and casual option on The Strip.  I'm not a fan of long lines either, especially for a slut I've already hit...up a few times in LA, but it was only about a 10 min wait on a Monday morning around 8:30. Sometimes when a restaurant expands there's a concern they're spreading themselves too thin, but the food here tasted the same as what I've had in LA (which is basically food truck style).  MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM DTLA LOCATION: -no bar counter seating here, but there is a communal table  -rather than having Broadway as the backdrop, they have The Chandelier  -longer hours (open til 7p) and slightly higher prices  The best part about Egglut being inside Cosmo? Instead of finishing on the spot, I can take this slut back to my room. Woooooooo!",

I do think they forgot the onions because I never detected even one, but the sandwich was so good I can forgive it. Also had a taste of my friend's biscuit which was also amazing. Line is long but moves fast! Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.",

    "text": "Eggslut was exactly what I needed after a long, eventful weekend in Vegas. I'd heard lots of good things about the location in LA, but I never got around to trying it. I was pleased to learn that they had a location at the Cosmopolitan while my friends and I were searching for a place to eat before our long trip back to San Diego.   We parked in the parking garage inside of the hotel, which costed $7. If you can brave the scorching Vegas heat, I'd recommend walking to avoid having to pay!   The line was really long and stretched all the way towards the bathrooms in the hallway. My friends and I waited about half an hour. We were all pretty beat from staying up all night for two nights in a row, so we really couldn't wait to grub. Thankfully, I thought the food was worth the wait! The food seemed simple. I thought, \"they're just breakfast sandwiches, right?\", but the sandwich I got was  really good for what it was. Plus, I love eggs in all of the many ways it can be cooked, so I knew I was at the right place. I got the Fairfax sandwich. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and light, and the soft brioche bun it came in made it a match made in heaven!! The flavors shined by way of the chives and sriracha mayo. I would get this again for sure. My boyfriend got the sausage, egg, and cheese and he let me have a bite, but I think the Fairfax was more memorable.  It's a bit pricey and the sandwich isn't really that big, but it's worth trying and I would probably come back if I were in Vegas again.",

    "text": "Trying to ensure balanced reviews here.  As per a previous review I've had better BEC from corner stores in the Northeast. Also Bojangles has simple and just as tasty BEC on biscuits for half the price. Compared to a similar concept Biscuit Bitch in Seattle, Eggslut was just poor. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't even what I'd call great. It just wasn't worth the social media craziness or the 40 minute wait to register or the 20 minute wait after for the order to be ready.   Three suggestions:  1. Get another grill or larger location .. I've seen faster delivery in a similar space. (see examples above) 2. Give the customer a chance to wait on the orange juice until after the order is ready ... after 20 minute waiting for food, mine was starting to get warm. 3. Maybe post wait from here is x minutes along the wall. My wife heard 30 minutes was likely. We doubled that (we were almost all the way down the hallway) and she wouldn't have stood there if we knew ahead of time.  I really wanted to like this place, but it is overhyped.",

The bread was incredibly fresh and almost melted in my mouth. Definitely one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was the bun, or the dressing, or the fact that I was just so hungry!   Side: Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie The chocolate is made of dark chocolate, and the salt complements the taste. Worth every bite! I highly recommend getting it, and eating it later in the day. But get them early! They only bake them in the morning.   I like that the restaurant is a \"quicker\" place in Vegas compared to other places. It's also very well priced for breakfast. I wish they had a few more items on the menu. Definitely recommend if you're in a quick bind for time!",

There was a huge line, about a half hour wait, but totally worth it.     I had the gaucho, which is an Argentinian style prime roast sandwich, with a fried egg, topped with an amazing chimi churri sauce. The buns they use are also sooooo fresh. They also serve fresh squeezed orange juice and amazing fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.  It is basically a cafeteria style sandwich place but these gourmet egg sandwiches are to die for. It's a perfect addition to the decadent Vegas lifestyle, if you are looking for a quick little hangover breakfast that will knock your socks off.",

It's so simple, but the brioche bun is so tasty and warm, the bacon is so crispy the egg is just right and the ketchup ties it all together. Loved it! Just wish I had gotten two.  We also got the biscuit. It's $5 for an ordinary size biscuit...so I wasn't too excited at first. However, it's really buttery on the inside, and the sweet butter they serve with it is divine! Maybe it is worth the $5...  Overall, a great breakfast/brunch stop if you're not looking for anything too fancy. Just be prepared to wait! Would stop here again.",

Their menu is not very extensive so I actually had a hard time deciding if there was anything I really wanted. I ended up getting the SLUT for $10 (you'd think it's cheap, but it's not). It is a \"cage-free coddled egg on top of house-made potato puree, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette.\" It's kind of small but honesty enough to hold me over for a meal. It is definitely something I want to attempt to make at home, as it just tastes like mashed potatoes with poached egg and sea salt.   Overall verdict is it's good but pricey. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it and especially if you're in Vegas because it's a lot more convenient at Caesar than elsewhere. Otherwise, not something I'd seek out every time I'm in Vegas.",

We waited in line then when it came our turn to order we should have run for the hills. I ordered the Gacho sandwich with no bread and no dairy. I specifically asked her if there was any type of cheese and she said no. The cashier asked me if I wanted to turn that into a salad, I said sure. My friend ordered the bacon eggslut sandwich. Upon receiving our order I asked the guy who delivered it what the white stuff covering the salad was. He said cheese. I returned it because I told them I couldn't have dairy (I'm on a very strict diet right now) and he got the cashier to come over. She told me she said there wasn't dairy on the sandwich, she never said there wasn't cheese on the salad.  Now how does this make any sense. I understand the sandwich is $16 and they didn't want to lose out on that but how are you going to argue with a paying guest? In front of a ton of other guests mind you. I told her I'd gladly pay for another order but I absolutely cannot have dairy. They said no and they would just make me a new one. About 15 minutes pass and I finally receive the correct order.  I bit into it and the meat was ice cold, the egg was luke warm. Even my boyfriend Andy who NEVER complains commented how cold it was. Also my friends bacon on his sandwich was so burnt you could pinch it and it fell apart. Completely charred.  Fast forward 5 hours later... food poisoning. I will never return.",

Its a great breakfast if you are trying to get something quick & greasy if you want something to soak up all that alcohol. Its not a light meal by any means its heavy on the butter which in turn will be heavy on the arteries. I wouldn't say its a must try but i would give it a shot if you want to try something different.",

    "text": "One of the best breakfast sandwiches of my life!  We ordered the fairfax and the egg bacon and cheese. everything was cooked perfectly and decadent. You could tell each ingredient in the sandwiches were of good quality and cooked well. The bacon was crispy but slightly chewy and thick, easy to bite. Egg was perfectly cooked, the cheese was amazing and it was all wrapped in a great brioche bun. The fairfax scrambled eggs were so fluffy and delicious, melding together in the buttery smooth brioche bun.  The slut was served in a cute jar. Stir it fast and spread it on your bread. So delicious, its like right between a custard and a cooked egg texture. You really taste the egg in its best form. The sea salt just adds that extra oomph factor. I ended up finishing the bread first and scooping up the \"slut\" and finishing it.  The line is long and moves fast. The service was decent though I hated that they couldn't give me tap water, such a Vegas move. I wish they offered more seats, my feet were killing me from the walk over and I was bummed about having to stand and eat at their counter. Otherwise it was a great experience, so much so my boyfriend went back in line to order another:",

So anyways I was so damn hungry and my sister was in line to order so I sat down and waited. While I was sitting a worker dropped off a burger in front of me soo I thought it was mine. So I start devouring this burger with my friend and then this lady working there snatches the burger from me and throws it in the trash.... (I guess it was not mine) I mean it was half eaten she could've just let us eat it no??? Well I give this place 3 stars because I got to eat half a burger for free and the free entertainment from all the drunk people walking by was great. Sorry eggslut won't happen again.",

It shouldn't be too hard to find! If lost, find the huge pink chandelier centerpiece.  Line was a little long. There were about 10 people ahead of us. But it moved, and there were restrooms nearby if you needed a relief.  I got the sausage sandwich for myself and the bacon for the bf. I forgot there was a fried egg inside, so when I took a bite, something exploded LOL. I was a little confused.. and then it hit me. So yes just a little reminder!!  My friends got the burger which took a little extra longer to come out.  Definitely a novelty, but it was delicious. I recommend coming here if you have the chance!",

I ordered the legendary \"The Slut\" - cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette....Sounds interesting and delicious right??? ---- Well, it's ONE SMALL poached egg on top of a bit of bland mashed potatoes with 3 small, toasted but cold pieces of bread, for $10.

And yes, it is absolutely worth a visit.  Eggslut may be the genius to what could be argued as the perfect breakfast sandwich. And the girl keeps it simple. The menu spread is: egg sandwiches, two specialties, two sides, and drinks. Eggslut is the brainchild of someone who found it egregious that gourmands like Jonathan Gold did not like eggs. We can argue all day about the texture of eggs but that does not stop Eggslut from offering patrons only the finest ingredients and the freshest taste.  This is the pure perfection, limited menu sister of In-n-Out. Why are still reading this and not filling your muppet hole with ooey gooey eggs, cheese and win?",

    "text": "I LOVE an egg sandwich!   Located in the 2nd floor on the other side of the fuschia chandelier center between Momofuku and Holstein's. Line wrapped around the corner. Arrived at 12:07p on a Tuesday. Food arrived at 12:30p. Plenty of seating for this time at lunch!   Bacon, egg (still a bit runny), cheese $8.50. I added avocado (you get 1 thick slice) for $2 extra. $11.37 our the door. Bacon was amazing and crispy.  The flavor combo was on-point. The bun is where they fail. Soft, but also meant it got soggy quickly. The brioche has a bit more air bubbles making it not as uniformly fluffy. The texture was off from usual high end bakeries. I would prefer a touch more toasted for texture on the cut sides, it was barely toasted so the bread was not warm. It was cold within 3 minutes because the sauce is cold and avocado is cold, bread isn't warm. Also they make like 5-6 at a time (you can stand and watch) and mine was the first, so time from assembly to the pass allows for additional cooling. I'd like to try the fair fax, but with an additional bacon and avocado.",

I remembered seeing the LA location on TV.  There was a line wrapping around to the hallway and waited about 20 minutes.  Ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich and Slut.  Both were delicious.  The Slut was unusual and something to try. Would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Decided to go to this restaurant while at the Cosmopolitan for breakfast and the line was wrapped around the corner so I was super psyched. I decided to try the Fairfax sandwich and the Slut and Vondrae bought one of their chocolate cookies. My sandwich was cool...neither one of our sandwiches were hot and I think I would've like it better if the rolls had been grilled but the eggs were fluffy and the turkey sausage they used was decent but a lukewarm sandwich for all that money was a turnoff. The slut was better than I expected because it had tons of FLAVOR but I got tired of it after eating the first crostini!! That chocolate cookie Vondrae bought was amazing! I have never eaten a cookie and needed four napkins for my hands during and after eating it! I was hoping to make this restaurant another one of my Vegas traditions because I was impressed with the teamwork, the sous vide they used to make the Slut, and the music that was playing while we wait but I'll pass. The food was not for me but that dang cookie",

    "text": "Thank god for Eggslut!! My friend and her family took a trip to Vegas back in April. I was just in Vegas for business and she told me before I flew out that this place was a must visit. My coworker and I went to Eggslut around 9 am Sunday morning. There was a line as expected. It goes pretty fast though since you just have to walk up to the register, order your food, and wait for them to call your name.  The first day I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese. The brioche bun was so soft and really big. The bacon was cooked to crispy perfection and the cheese and over medium egg combo left the sandwich filled with flavor. They do put sriracha ketchup on the bun which takes the sauce level up a notch. I would highly recommend this one over the sausage, egg and cheese which I got Wednesday morning. The sausage, egg and cheese comes with turkey sausage, over medium egg, cheese and honey mustard aioli. This wasn't nearly as saucy as the first one. I wouldn't recommend the orange juice, but I still have that bacon, egg and cheese on my mind!",

    "text": "If you just happen to walk into the second level of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and saw the name of the place, you would probably think, \"oh, a place with a vulgar name, that probably just serves breakfast.\"  No one would blame you if you did, except there would be some telltale signs it's just not \"someplace.\"  What you have here is a transplant from a food truck, into a brick-and-mortar restaurant, that features all the staples of egg laden breakfast, and a random cheeseburger added to the menu. Don't be surprised, if you and your kids, neighbors, friends, family, family-one-removed, and others you need wanted with you, jump into the silly 20-45 minute line for food.  It's a place that is a \"slut\" to the mighty liquid chicken.    Yes, you will think, is it worth it, when there are so many other place to eat food, that is probably awful and full of fail; oh wait, this isn't a place of fail, rather a place for win... if by WIN, you mean You want an egg sandwich.    Waiting in line, the worst part, is only complemented by the other people who are also wanting one of these lovelies.  Good sir, this place knows it has lines, and does what it can to pump out them goodness.  Get the Fairfax, their signature \"piece-de-resistance\"... add avocado and bacon, because you want the ABCs.. \"A=Avocado, B=Bacon, and C=Cheese\" pressed between your teeth.  Scrambled egg sandwich,.. is actually want you are ordering.    They make the buns on the property, so they taste fresh.. and buttered.  so really don't deny yourself something full of noms, nommy in your tummy... there is a long line, which is why I can't give you 5 stars, but it's worth going.   Lines are short late afternoon-before dinner, but after lunch... morning at open, there is already a line of 20-30 customers, so unless you come way before 7am, expect to wait also.  It's okay they are a slut for eggs, because what comes from it, is a well mannered result.",

I had also heard about how long the line can get, so when I saw that they had a branch in vegas too , we decided to come here instead. Though there was still a line, I am sure it was not as bad as LA's. We got \"the slut\" and fairfax sandwich.  The slut was good something unique but I was not expecting much from the sandwich. I mean come on it looked just like a normal sandwich with egg but boy I was so wrong. It was one of the creamiest, cheesiest sandwich ever. The sweetness from the caramelized onions and the Brioche bread was amazing. It didn't have any textures and though I like textures in food but I liked this soft,gooey and mushy sandwich.  I even tried making the sandwich at home and pleased that the result was very successful. Definitely worth it.",

    "text": "If you plan on eating at Eggslut, be prepared for two things: To wait in a long line, and to possibly not have a seat available at their small community table.   After waiting twenty minutes in line, then another ten minutes waiting for food, I was starting to wonder what the hype was about. The curiosity stemmed more from my growling stomach than my head, but it was quickly answered once I took the first bite of my sandwich.   I ordered the Fairfax sandwich. The first thing I noticed is how fluffy the eggs are. It's like eating a pile of tasty, yellow clouds. The slice of cheddar cheese they put on the sandwich was thick, so the flavor wasn't overpowered by the eggs, and at the same time didn't overpower the eggs. I am not a fan of mayo, but when you add Siracha to the mix, it solves the problem for me. Plus, the mayo wasn't slathered on.   The people working the counter aren't quiet when calling out the orders that are ready, so there is really no reason to wait in line at that point, unless you like to watch people make eggs. If you do wait in line, you are possibly forfeiting an open spot at the table.   The line and wait may be long, but in the end, it is very much worth it.  Side note: If you want coffee, go somewhere else. The copy here costs five dollars, and it's a very small cup of very average coffee.",

I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas. We ended up going back twice during our trip. I had the Fairfax and my husband had the cheese burger.  That fairfax sandwich was so slutty for me!! Every bite was so delicious and made me say mmmm. It felt naughty lol. The brioche bun was soft and warms, the eggs cooked perfectly and seasoned generously without being salty then perfectly paired with a sriracha mayo. It was just amazing.  My husbands burger came out perfectly medium and juicy (not bloody). He literally ate the whole burger in five bites. And couldn't wait to go back and get the sandwich made with Waygu beef (can't remember the name). That, as well, was just so good. I recommend this place 10 times over as a stop for a quick breakfast sandwich or after a night of drinking, it will not disappoint. Oh and the staff was nice as well.",

The Cons:  - At 9:00am or so the line had about 60 customers. Fortunately it only took 30-40 mins to get to the front.  - Limited seating area/tables.  - Menu is a bit finite. My husband likes ,not loves, eggs and he preferred to grab a bite somewhere else as there is not much variety.   Tried it once and liked it but not enough to come back anytime soon.",

    "text": "\"Can I have one slut\", to the cashier, trying not to laugh while placing my order. After watching a friend's Eggslut Facebook post, I Yelped this place and did my research, bookmarked and made sure I stop by here while on my Vegas vacation. Located at The Cosmopolitan hotel, which was so convenient for me. We stayed right across from Cosmopolitan so we walked over to Eggslut. As I head to the 2nd level, I see the famous Eggslut logo, I looked at the line which wasn't so bad but didn't see the end of the line which was near the bathroom. The line got longer after I stood in line and I am glad I arrived 5 mins earlier. Don't let the long line stop you from trying out this place, the lines do move quick. The wait in line helped me and my other half decide on what to order, the other half went to get us a table across of Eggslut. When it was my turn in line, I placed my order one slut (10.50), one fair fax (8.50), side bacon (3.00), and extra baguette (no charge) . ( I learned this from reading the Yelp reviews & tips) paid for my meal and waited for my name to be called. I got to see the the cooks in action prepping the slut and all the good stuff. My name was called in less than 10 minutes. Everything was package nicely. The Fairfax in a nice brown bag and the slut came in a mason jar with baguette. The other half found us nice seats. I love all the seats, its so trendy. I had to take a ton of pictures before we were ready to eat.  My other half and I both shared our orders and we loved our breakfast, esp. the slut.   The Fairfax, cage-free scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sriracha mayo, in a warm brioche bun. I loved the egg so fluffy and along with the bun, everything was perfect together. The Fairfax tasted exactly as the description. YUMS!!  The Slut is their specialty, cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Directions for eating the Slut was to mix it first, and I spread the slut on to my baguette, instead of dipping my baguette. I added the bacon to my baguette, I loved the bacon, it was cooked to perfection.   Overall, I was so happy I finally get to try this place, we went here on the day of my anniversary, which we had a delicious breakfast to celebrate our 22nd!! I can't wait for more Eggsluts, when I visit Vegas again!",

If you're in a hurry, skip it and search yelp again for more options... I got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. It was excellent from the soft inside but crunchy outside bun, juicy bacon, and perfectly cooked egg. My boyfriend got the gaucho sandwich and it was amazing. It was honestly worth the wait. No complaints on the food whatsoever besides I wish their prices were more on the cost-effective side. I will definitely come back when I hit up Vegas again. I wish they had a location in the bay area though!",

The reason why I give it a 2 star is because it is way too hyped up. This place is literally nothing special, you could simply make this at home! The menu tells you what's in the sandwhich and trust me, just make it at home.. it'll taste the same and so much cheaper.  On top of that it is way too over price for what you're getting AND you gotta wait in a long line. It's def not filling if you're really hungry as well. I don't think this place is worth the money and wait.  This place is on the 2nd floor to your left at The Cosmopolitan and it opens from 7am to 4pm.   I took pictures of the menu as well which has the prices.",

You can spread it on the toasted baguette pieces or just eat it straight. It was so good that The Wife and I went back a second time the next day.  Do it. You won't regret it.

Don't tell my gym trainer, but I've had two at once on occasion.  Sandwich-wise, I usually go straight for the egg salad - just delectable. When I'm in a more carnivorous mood, the gaucho with its seared tri-tip is fantastic. Otherwise, the straightforward sausage egg and cheese gets the job done.  To avoid the lines, try in the early afternoon. It also opens at midnight on weekend nights (Fri night, Sat night) and is usually not crowded until the drunk eaters come out of Marquee.  When I'm at eggslut, it's a little alarming how much I can spend on breakfast food. When I'm not at eggslut, I'm glad it's expensive because it keeps me away from negating my gym sessions.",

As many other reviewers have noted, it's creamy mashed potatoes topped with a perfectly coddled egg, some seasonin's (chive and grey sea salt) in a jar along with slices of toasted and buttered baguette.   The line was wrapped around the corner and not quite to the restrooms, but the women ahead of me did take a long time in ordering which was a bit frustrating, however, the cashier was manning two registers and my order was taken efficiently.   I don't typically order orange juice but I did here, and it was delicious! Was it fresh-squeezed? Possibly!  I was concerned about seating, but people tend to eat and go since it's not the type of place to lounge, so by the time my order came up (within several minutes), I had secured a spot along their high top.   At first taste, it was salty, but that's because I didn't mix it up like I was supposed to. The egg yolk had the right amount of ooze and warmth. When I did stir up the whole thing, it was good on its own or spread onto the bread, which was a perfect amount of toasted/chewiness.   I would say if you were starving, this would not have filled you up. I was feeling a might peckish and this was the perfect amount of food.   I debated keeping the jar, but there was nothing discerning it from any other jar, so I left it in their designated recycling shelf. Otherwise their waste is compostable!   Very happy to have made this one of my last meals in Vegas.",

I have food allergies and I mentioned them to the woman taking my order Lara, she even checked the ingredients menu in the back to make sure I was ok!! She was so lovely and understanding!! And she double checked with Mark Culp who is also the best! I was told to avoid the bacon because my allergy could've been in contact with the grill. My first sandwich I received had bacon on it so I was discouraged and didn't want to eat my boyfriend got me a new sandwich but with food allergies it's scary to eat food once a mistake is made even if you have new food, being as your life is on the line once a mistake is made so I didn't eat the new sandwich. Mark came over to my table to ask how the food turned out remembering my allergy, I told him about the bacon and that I wasn't comfortable eating because if a mistakes made once I'd rather not eat at all, but it wasn't a big deal I'm use to that! Mark made me a sandwich himself and I have never been happier, it's truly thrilling encountering people who actually care about your food allergy and your safety it's so rare and people like Mark and Lara need to be more common in the food industry. Allergies need to be taken seriously! Thank you guys so much!",

    "text": "I was dying to eat at Eggslut having checked in out when I was in Las Vegas for work in November. The place is crazy popular so go early and prepare to wait in a short line. The service is fast. You essentially place your order, take a seat at a communal counter, and wait for them to call you name. The name of the game here is eggs, although they do offer a butternut biscuit.   I was planning to oder the Slut, their signature dish with a cage-free coddles egg, but the chef at Momofuku told me to order the scrambled eggs as he said they were the best he'd ever eaten. That meant I had to order the Fairfax with cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. I added in avocado and elected to get the dish on top of a salad instead of the brioche bun. It's nice they offer option.   The eggs were unbelievable!! Best scrambled eggs ever. I asked what the secret was and was told, \"lots of butter.\"   Drinks are very limited and include OJ, Coke, water and drip coffee.  A fun experience and delicious quick breakfast. I'll definitely be back.",

The egg sandwiches if anything were too salty... maybe it's the sauce or maybe just put too much salt. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce... I guess it was too saucy.   Coffee sucks! Both of our coffees were just crappy, bland coffee.   Orange juice is not fresh. It's Tropicana oj for sure. I know what \"fresh orange juice\" tastes like and that was not fresh.   Eggslut is definitely overrated and not worth coming to.",

We definitely were not disappointed. Each of us ordered the \"Slut\" which was beyond amazing. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and coddled egg cooked to perfection. Plus the toast on the side with their butter (which had a touch of sweetness to it) just completed it. I also got the Fairfax sandwich with the turkey and avocado which was also amazing. Nestled in the bougie Cosmopolitan, it was a really great experience. The only downside was the line was very long, but it went by a lot quicker than we thought. I definitely would recommend going here!",

The second time we went, she had fairfax.  She liked the fairfax much more.  The service is slow because of the high demand.  However, it's totally worth it.

There's no where to sit so we ate our food at the Chandelier Bar and went home. About three hours after eating his Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich my boyfriend began puking and has been ever since. I'm so glad we waited an hour in line only for him to contract food poisoning. Thanks Eggslut!",

It was not worth the wait. I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and arugula salad. The sandwich was below average. Too much bread, too little egg. The arugula salad was actually good, but they did not include a fork. I had to eat with my hands. Very expensive also. $65 for our party of four. I will not be returning.",

Well this last weekend for some reason I guess all the CES folks had partied too hard and there was virtually no line. So we did it.  I love a good breakfast sandwich and this did not disappoint except for the cost of $8. Do not expect a firm or even over medium cooked egg - the yolk was completely liquid and the white was barely holding together. It looked sunny side up to me. Chipotle catsup was fine. We also ordered 2 biscuits at $5 each and they needed to be much warmer as the butter didn't even melt. I asked for ice water and they would only offer bottled water which was like $4.00 so I went for the $5 OJ - which was not very big.  The counters all needed to be wiped off and were sticky from the maple syrup they serve with the biscuits. Fun trendy vibe, all the kitchen staff wears their snap backs backward - the name is funny - and the music is more hip hop. Would I wait in a long line for this again? Nah, probably not. But I an now agree with others who say - \"have you eaten at Eggslut - it's so good!\" Yep, eaten there and it was good but not SO good.",

After finally receiving my sausage, egg and cheese sandwich I was the most disappointed when my bread wasn't warm and the ingredients inside were a luke warm.

The portion is very hearty. I enjoyed the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a brioche bun, and the flavors were just so good. Bacon is applewood smoked and there is a lot of it. Egg is cooked medium so it oozes out of sandwich, can be a bit messy. Price is $8 which for this quality of breakfast sandwich was worth it. As for avoiding lines, I noticed when I was around the area in mid to late afternoon and there was no line at all, in case you want to have a hearty snack or early dinner and you are around there, great time to go.",

Just like anything else in Vegas, it's overpriced but he food is good.  2 egg sandwiches with and orange juice was almost $30.  Everything is made fresh. It's located in a very fancy hotel/casino. This place is BUSY! Get there early or you'll be stuck in line forever!",

My take on eggslut, is this establishment is just that, a stinking hoe out to take you for your money and not give you much in return. Sandwiches are small, they cost about $8 each, without much inside. The slut is $10, again so small! You need to spend about $20 to be full. As a vegetarian I was depressed, asked for no bacon, to find a fried egg over cheese, it was pathetic.  The slut on the other hand is tasty, just small. Try it out for yourself, make sure you order enough so you don't have to get back in line.",

The biscuit, you wouldn't give it a second thought anywhere else.    The slut was interesting but not amazing, not bad but not... omg we need to stand in line for this.   The gaucho sandwich was good and could have been great if they would have seasoned the meat even a little.  The other ingredients were perfect but very bland meat.  WARNING: the over easy egg will explode all over you.  Tons of napkins.    Tried it. Once and done.   My wife is laughing as I'm typing this. I said \"what?\"  She said 3 women walked up to the counter and said \"3 sluts\".  The cashier laughed and one of the women raised her arm as in... yeah well... either way.",

Gaucho : Seared Wagyu tri tip steak with over med egg, with chimmichurri sauce on a warm broche bun. Flavorful packed in one sandwich I would order this if you are REALLY hungry. The steak and egg was cooked to perfection.   Fairfax: scrambled eggs with cheese, onion served in a warm brioche bun. YUM!    My fav item: the SLUT which is potato puree and poached egg on top. You mix it lightly in the jar by doing counter clock wise turns slowly. I prefer thick chunks so I only turn it about 5-6 times max otherwise it gets too soft and does not have the bite to it.",

We waited in line for about 30 or so minutes, and ordered one Fairfax Sandwich with bacon and an Egg, Sausage, & Cheese sandwich.  I liked my Farifax Sandwich more as it had flavorful eggs, cheese, caramelized onions, chives, & crispy bacon nestled in a soft & fluffy brioche bun, and a slight kick from the siracha mayo. My fiance however, preferred the Egg, Sausage, & Cheese because of the honey mustard aioli and turkey sausage, which he thought were more tasty components than the ones on my sandwich.  After eating, we were satisfied but not overly full. One sandwich each was the perfect portion to hold us over until we went to a buffet later in the afternoon. I would definitely stop by again to try another sandwich .. Or actually just get the Fairfax again.",

My favorite was the Bacon-Egg&Cheese. Something about that bacon that caught my taste buds! Oh and don't forget the orange juice! Went down very smooth!

I can tell it confuses people who assume the line is short only to find out it extends past that door.   The good thing is that it's a limited menu so there's not too many people holding up the line with their decisions. The assembly line is really fun to watch while waiting for your food. I got the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. Maybe it's because people hyped it up too much or maybe I should've got the #instaworthy Slut, but to me it wasn't great.",

I expected a little wait based on previous reviews but when the hubs and I got there, there was only 1 person at the register taking orders yet there are 2 registers. The manager was busy refilling napkin dispensers and putting napkins on plates. You've got to be kidding me.   Limited seating, you'll have to keep an eagle eye out for when someone finishes up to cop a spot. I got the bacon egg and cheese ($8) and the hubs got the cheeseburger ($10).

I ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich and loved every last bite , From The fresh  bread to the delicious house made sausage inside with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg etc! It's a generous sized sandwich and does get messy if you choose sunny side or over easy egg inside BUT you can also get your egg scrambled. The staff was also very efficient and friendly. Their specialty is breakfast sandwiches and the location itself Is not huge so it's not really a sit down restaurant, although There is some seating but very limited , most people take their orders to go . If you're hungry make sure you get there a little early because there is usually a lineup but I can't say we waited overly long to be served. All in all I wish they had a location in my city so I could enjoy one of their sandwiches any time !",

The steak and egg brioche sandwich is not to be missed, and this is one of the easier, cheaper ways to get that afternoon delight.",

To start, both were barely warm.   The Wagyu on the Gaucho was thin sliced, well done, grey, and tasted like a london broil.  The egg was medium firm with very little yolk and everything was over powered by the chimmi churri that was dominated by the flavor of cilantro.   The bacon on the Fairfax tasted like it had been sitting on a pile in a sheet pan on top of the griddle; oh wait that's because it was.  The scrambled eggs were not creamy and delicate with the flavor of chives. The only flavor that stood out was the chipotle aioli, which to be fair was good, but it's flavored mayo so that's not all that impressive.  The brioche was good but it's not made in house so I can't give them credit for that.  All in all I'd say save your $35.",

It's located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel and it's definitely a stop any tourist in Vegas should make before leaving. The bad thing is that it is very popular so the line is always long. My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try and while we had to wait like 20 minutes or so in like to order, it was definitely worth the wait. My girlfriend loves egg salad so she decided to order their egg salad bagel sandwich which she says is the best egg salad she has ever had. In fact, we decided to replicate it at home and while it wasn't exactly the same, it did taste like heaven. I ordered the egg slut which was basically a mashed potato puree with an runny egg on top, served up in a glass jar with some baguettes on the side. It didn't look a lot, but it was definitely filling and quite scrumptious. I will definitely be making a return to this place if I'm ever back in Vegas.",

SEC was good, solid fare with honey mustard aioli. Gaucho had a nice chimichurri sauce and quality tri-tip wagyu. Advice: remove from the paper even if you feel inclined not to. It's pretty slippery and I had finished the top bun by accident about halfway through. Their brioche buns are delicious. No real sides available, but nice, strong coffee. Overall, recommend, but wouldn't wait in a crazy line for it.",

While a great sandwich, the price + wait just was not a recipe for a good experience & I would pass if I was given the opportunity again.",

Wasn't special in anyway *Bacon Egg & Cheese - $8 Its cool, but I can't make this at home? $3 to add sausage, I'll pass. *SLUT - $10.50 Its a egg/potatoe cooked in a little jar... but yes this special. If this is what you are coming for, then I can see why. *Fresh Orange Juice - $5 Cant forgot this.  Luckily I didn't wait forever and a day for this, but my review wouldn't be as pleasant if I had to wait 30 minutes or longer like some people have.(But I waited forever at Secret Pizza and yeah...)

    "text": "Finally... Finally had the (egg)slut. My last trip to Las Vegas we had stayed at The Cosmopolitan and the location was still under construction but said opening soon. Fast forward 3 months and YES, a slut is born. I've always wanted to try the OG Eggslut at Grand Central Market in Downtown LA but I've been trying to avoid the long crazy lines. Not that this one located across the way from Marquee on the 2nd floor doesnt have crazy lines of their own. We wanted to go there at lunch right before going to the day club and the line must have been at least 100-150 people deep. CRAZY! I ended up going after the day club and there was no line at all so it worked out.  I went with the bacon, egg & cheese on a strong suggestion from my friend that had it the previous morning for breakfast. It was great. It was served up on a really good brioche bun served warm but it had cooled down a bit since I walked it back to my room. The sammich came with a good amount of delicious smoked bacon, an over-medium egg, cheddar cheese and ketchup with a kick. I really liked it. The combination of flavors made for the perfect breakfast style sandwich. The runny egg was great. The bacon was smoked niceness. The cheese was tasty. The sammich had good flavor and filled you up enough as a small meal unto itself.    Service was super friendly. Appreciated that. The cashier's son had a similar name to mine so we had a pleasant convo about names/nicknames. He made sure the bottled water I got was super cold and the lady that retrieved it for me was nice enough to find the coldest one and to also bag my sandwich because I forgot to mention it was to-go.  I will certainly go back to Eggslut again the next time I'm at The Cosmopolitan. I def wanna try the famous slut... They're opening one in Glendale so it might be time to finally be a regular and hit all the highlights on their menu.",

Located by the chandelier on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel you'll find this small place with a yellow neon sign and a line around the corner and down the hall. Just get in line and do it. Trust me.   There are two menus on the wall. One right next to the register and another in the hallway the line goes down during peak times. They try to move fast so it's good to know what you want when arriving to the register.   I've been here a number of times. Try to time your visit to when masses of people aren't entering or leaving the Marquee nightclub / dayclub. I have found 7am (5am on Sat and Sun) and 4pm provide the shortest waits. The lines do tend to move faster than you originally think.   What do you order? I like varying the different egg styles.   The Fairfax: The main reason most people stop here. Light fluffy scrambled eggs that are slightly undercooked with some chive. It's my favorite.  Slut: your traditional coddled egg in a jar with potato puree. Just remember to give it a light mixing before dunking your bread.  Gaucho: Some Wagyu Steak with an over medium egg. Some days I just have a craving for steak.   You can also get beer or freshly squeezed orange juice. Take your pick. I like the OJ but wish the cup was bigger for $5.   Have a great time and make some friends in line.",

I wish I had tried the other menu items, but I alone and didn't think I'd be able to finish more than one item (don't think the food would taste that great later, sandwich got cold fast while I was taking pictures of it )",

    "text": "I was excited to try Eggslut while in Vegas because I have been wanting to try the LA location for quite sometime.  Located on the second level of the Cosmopolitan, we decided to have our late lunch here because there also wasn't a line (it was 1PM). I ordered the Fairfax and my fiance ordered the Gaucho; both orders came out quickly. For such a popular place, I wasn't impressed. The Fairfax consisted of soft scrambled eggs/chives/cheddar/caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun. The overall sandwich lacked flavor and the consistency of the eggs was too runny/watery. The brioche bun was my favorite part. My fiance however, enjoyed his sandwich very much. The Gaucho had wagyu tri-tip steak over a medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and arugula on a brioche bun, I took a bite of his' and had to admit that I ordered the wrong one..the Gaucho was yummy.  Maybe I expected more from all the hype. Hope to try other sandwiches at Eggslut during my next visit to Vegas or La la Land.",

I expected the yolk to be a bit runnier, but it looks like they maybe overdid it.  The potatoes were not at creamy as I'd like - a little on the granular side.  Its a decent lighter snack, but overall didn't wow me too much.  Maybe its better to stick with their breakfast sandwiches.  Their cold brew coffee was okay, though on the pricier side at $5.",

I had the fairfax with bacon, making it a $10+ breakfast sandwich. The fairfax was nice and buttery with fluffy scrambled eggs, sriracha mayo, and bacon.  My friend had the slut, which is a coddled egg, potato puree and some salt. She was not impressed.  Luckily, she had also ordered a breakfast sandwich.   Positives: line moves fast, food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.   The chocolate cookie with sea salt was the best thing I had at Eggslut!   Maybe this place has the \"secret pizza\" effect, where late night intoxication makes the food taste better. *shrugs*  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 44/100",

I came here a few times for breakfast during my stay at the Cosmo and can happily say I was pleased every time. My favorites were the Fairfax Sandwich, with turkey sausage and the Slut. My food was warm, fresh and tasteful. I agree with some people when they say they don't see what the big deal is, when it comes to the sandwiches but mine was very good. I do think the \"Slut\" is super unique and delicious, I wish I had time to get it once more before leaving.   Caveat: I got there super early every morning, as I was still on East Coast time...so I did not wait on any type of line. Would I wait on a huge line for this? No, I definitely wouldn't....don't think its worth it. But if there's barely a line, I would absolutely say give Eggslut a try.   Until we meet again....",

The staff was friendly and accommodating because it was slow and the Slut was pretty tasty. If only I had a little Tabasco or Crystals it'd been perfect.  The biscuit was dry and for 5 bucks, I wish they threw in some jam or something. Instead, they give you maple syrup and butter. The sandwich was ok and the sausage patty we added to it tasted like it was from a convenient store.  Overall, I don't think I'd be back on my own but it was a fun experience.

Coming from SF, where brunch is basically a competitive sport, I've literally seen and eaten it all. I was so excited to try this in Vegas because I have been wanting to go to the LA location for years... mostly because I've seen it on instagram and the name is funny. #millennial  My friend and I waited in line for an eternity and a half (I mean 25 minutes) before ordering. The entire time, we were watching the bar/countertop seating area for open seats. For such a popular place, there are not NEARLY enough seating to meet the demand. Also, the seating area could use some clean-up between diners - lots of grease around. We eventually grabbed two seats and ate our breakfast sandwiches while the couple next to us shared one chair to eat (just to give you a visual of how tight the space is). The sandwiches were honestly meh. Yes, they were tasty, but being slightly hungover, we expected to LOVE our sandwiches. We didn't. It just was not extraordinary in any way, but what you get is exactly what is listed on the menu... Does that make sense? For all the hype and wait time, I expected rainbow unicorn glitter to come exploding out of my sandwich or something. Maybe we should have ordered the slut, their namesake. Or maybe their food could have just lived up to the hype. Oh well.",

I liked the flavor of the sausage and the egg was a little runny.  The mustard aioli was a good addition to the sandwich, since all the other elements are fairly rich tasting.  Overall, I was not blown away for the price I paid, so I am giving four stars.  It was still a satisfying meal.",

There was egg and hollandaise sauce and other ingredients I'm unsure of in a little jar and there was baguette on the side. It was hands down the best egg sandwich combination I've ever had. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really good too. The sausage, egg and cheese was really good but it was a sloppy sandwich. Overall, it was an awesome experience. Hands down the best brunch place in Vegas that I've tried.",

Respectively, there are quite a few places open late but we came across Egg Slut in the Cosmopolitan while walking back to our hotel and needless to say it did satisfy but there were two items ordered and one was a hit, the other a miss.  Hit: I ordered the \"Slut\" and it was a potato porridge with egg all cooked together in a little mason jar. Yes, I would like to specify that the jar was indeed small because I finished it in six whole bites (but this is a minor gluttonous issue I have that would be useful for some and unhelpful for many). In any case, I really like this! It was really hearty and warm -- perfect for a cold walk through the strip.  Miss: My boyfriend had ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit that Egg Slut is known for and he was thoroughly disappointed. Honestly, he didn't even finish it and left it half-eaten in the tray. He referred to it being very dry and that was the losing point for it all.",

However, as I waited for my order I saw multiple people who were behind me in line walk up and get their order almost instantaneously. They looked like bacon or sausage sandwiches. I know what you're thinking, the gaucho probably takes longer because it's steak. I asked them if that's what takes so long, but the passer-out guy said, no that one is right here. It was the sandwich that had been sitting there getting cold for 20 of the 30 minutes I was waiting after having ordered. While the other two were for my family, I tasted them and they were mediocre. Nothing out of this world. The gaucho was only ok, perhaps if it was warm it would have been tastier. The guy handing them out's customer service consisted of, \"don't worry, they're coming,\" and, \"I don't know what happened.\"",

The best part about this location is that if you come during down times, there will not be a wait at all! I stopped by around 2pm on a weekday, and there was no one in line!   I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese (~$9). I waited a few minutes for my order as they cook it fresh. The sandwich was hot and melt in your mouth delicious with the cheese oozing out. I'm a big fan of brioche, and their brioche bun was perfectly soft with a little bit of a chewy outside crust! If you're really hungry, one sandwich might not be enough so maybe get another sandwich or their signature slut!   When I'm back in Vegas and won't be making my way down to LA after, I will definitely be back!",

I got the sausage egg and cheese, and bf got the guacho (has steak), and the slut (egg in the cup). We were completely blown away by how good it was and I can't really explain why it was so good. The buns were soft, the steak and arugula complimented the sandwich so well and the sausage egg and cheese just melts in your mouth.

When my boyfriend and I were walking around the Cosmo and saw a sign for Eggslut, I got really excited. I've seen pictures of their iconic logo all over social media, and had no idea they even had a location in Vegas! We were looking at the sign, trying to figure out where exactly it was located when an average looking man was telling us where to go. However once we took a closer look, we realized he had an ear piece of some sorts - so he was an undercover cop LOL. A nice undercover at least!!  After waiting in line for quite some time, I finally decided to order the Fairfax Sandwich. When I finally got my hands on it, I immediately dug in. It felt really indulgent, but kind of in a negative way. The cheese and what I'm guessing is oil that the eggs are cooked in gave the sandwich a really buttery and silky feel. This paired up with the already really buttery-in-nature brioche bun made it seem as if there was too similar of a flavor profile. I wish it came on a ciabatta bun of something to give it some different kind of texture.   Although the Fairfax wasn't as successful in my opinion, that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to come back and try something else such as their Slut speciality. Til next time Eggslut!!",

I dragged my husbands from the wynn all the way to cosmo to test it out. I was a bit disappointed when I saw about 15chairs available and a line the size of a circus waiting. Damn. Clearly everyone got the memo. Typically, is turn around and go somewhere else, but since we made the trip we had to fight it out. 45mins later we ordered and brawled for 2 chairs (not really, but it makes the story better) :) I got the fair fax and my husband got the sausage and egg. We also got the biscuit to share. Our meals were great, besides the tasteless biscuit; BUT not worth the wait! An hour for a breakfast sandwich hay didn't blow my mind is just not worth it. I'd only return if I stayed at the cosmo and there was no line... otherwise, a sit down restaurant will have to do.  Still giving 4 stars for good food!",

It was just an egg on some potatoes and it didn't strike me as anything amazing or unique. It is something you can make at home so I would skip this. Their sandwiches on the other hand are delicious! Their brioche buns are buttery, soft, and delectable. We had the fairfax and the gaucho sandwiches and they did not disappoint! I could have eaten another fairfax if I wasn't so full!",

PLEASE people - don't be like the couple in front of us who waited in line for 30 mins - only to get to the counter to be indecisive. They were asking all kinds of questions and humming and hawing, then they shuffle through their purse to find their money to pay. Idiots!  We ordered a bacon sandwich and a original eggslut to split. The sandwich was the winner, they do NOT skimp on bacon and the roll is nice and fluffy. I'm glad we tried the eggslut, it really should come with 2 eggs since the ratio of potatoes and eggs is way off. Also the toast that came with it wasn't properly toasted and a bit flabby. (easy fix, they should be more on their game for that.)  Glad I tried it, would happily go to the NYC location.",

I also have never been one of those people that has to check things off my list just so I can tell everyone I did it. That's probably why it took me at least 5 trips to Vegas to finally make a point of going here and the only reason I did, is because I LOVE EGGS!! I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Now I get it, this is Vegas, on the strip, and in the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, but come on people. This is nothing special. In fact, I am almost certain I can make a better breakfast sandwich than this one. In fact, I just did this morning. Not only was it less expensive, but I made it quicker also. I really have it down to a science. So, let's just say I will not be going here again, I will continue to enjoy my own sandwiches at home.",

The buns are the perfect brown and oh so soft. The eggs are fluffy, creamy, and tasty - the way they should be.   I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with sausage, a great decision. At first I was afraid that the sauce would throw me off. But I was surprised in a good way. The risk proved to deliver a high reward.   This place is definitely doing everything right.

I followed Eggslut's instagram probably close to a year before one opened in LA close to me in Glendale. Also, you gotta love the name. I'm a self proclaimed slut for eggs. But seriously, spend your money elsewhere eating delicious eggs and breakfast food.   It's beautiful food on instagram, but really it's a typical kind of boring breakfast sandwich people!! Hello!!! You can make this at home and it'll be close enough!! Ok, sure, the ingredients are high quality. You can't get those beautiful brioche buns. But really for the money you're paying GO SOMEWHERE ELSE more interesting for breakfast in Vegas! Seriously!  The ONLY thing I can stand by is the coddled egg. The little crispy bread slices, wonderful smooth potato puree, and soft egg with a runny yolk sprinkled with a very tasty sea salt is actually worth a try. BUT THATS IT.   Take it from a hardcore, diehard breakfast lover. We demand better.",

This sandwich comes with chipotle ketchup and i was unsure about that because I'm not really a ketchup fan but OMG it was delish!   Why the 4 stars instead of 5? Well because the bread could have been better. It wasn't warm like described.

I've been stalking Eggslut on IG for YEARS salivating over their pics. I've always known they were in LA, but ended up jumping on the bed this morning when I figured out there was a location in Vegas. I was SUPER geeked! I got dressed, walked 18min from MGM to the Cosmopolitan and stood in a 25min line (all things I have no problem doing for mouth-watering food) for a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. While I can appreciate the nice staff and their fast service, the sandwich itself was just not what I was expecting. I would say it's a little over-hyped, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I stood in line for 25+ min for a luke warm sandwich on an untoasted/unwarmed brioche bun. The over medium egg was almost room temperature, and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will say, their house-made turkey sausage tasted very good and the honey mustard aioli was a nice touch. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it better if the sandwich was actually served hot--as it should be. Overall I just didn't get the mind blowing experience that I was expecting. Definitely not going back during the rest of my stay, but I'll maybe try the LA location next time I'm there to see if it's any different.",

    "text": "Pretty good breakfast, but not worth the wait in my opinion.  There is almost always a line there since it's Vegas. I didn't mind it too much because it was so difficult to choose an item because everything on the menu looked so good. I ended up with a cheeseburger and the side (arugula) salad.   The burger was decent. The bun is my favorite part, but the rest is pretty ordinary: pretty thin patty, runny egg, etc. I had to add some of my arugula salad in the burger for some extra taste. The salad itself was good initially but is too sour to finish. I also tried the cookie. The salt on top is a weird combination but the chocolate cookie itself was pretty bomb.  Overall, I probably would not visit again. My boyfriend went as far as saying he would rather have a McMuffin. I liked my burger, but do agree that this is more of an Instagram-worthy restaurant than a worthy restaurant period.",

I had heard great things about this place prior to my trip so as a foodie, I knew it was somewhere I needed to try!   A small corner in the Cosmopolitan, there is an open grill and counter-style ordering. There is a small amount of bar style seating as well as some lounge style seating right across the hall. Perfect stop for a quick breakfast, or breakfast style lunch or dinner quite honestly I could have ate here every day.   I ordered \"The Slut\" which is a mason jar type of glass cup filled with mashed potatoes topped with a poached egg, salt and a side of toast. I also asked for a side of the honey mustard aioli. O-M-G. Incredible. An absolute must have. This was easily one of my favorite meals while in Las Vegas. So much so I went back twice for the same thing!",

    "text": "All aboard the hype train! Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is definitely one of the busiest breakfast spots in town. Be ready to wait 15 minutes to order and another 10 to pick up your food!   Despite my reservations, I ate here twice for good measure.  The first day I went to try this, the line was so long that I bailed. The next day I waited til lunchtime for good measure, and there was no wait at all. It's all in the timing! The classic 'Slut' is the signature dish here, but I was craving that yolky burst, so opted for a sandwich.   I got the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, which is made with turkey sausage and topped with a honey mustard aioli. It came out quick and fresh, which was almost a con because the cheese didn't fully melt. The egg, listed as over-medium, is actually still super soft in the middle so expect to get yolked on! I found the first few bites very bland, and it wasn't til I hit the yolk, the aioli in the middle, and a couple of more well-seasoned bits of the sausage that I really began to enjoy it. The cheese is weak for me - I'd prefer something with more of a tang. The brioche bun holds up well but I'm not convinced it's the best guy for the job... but maybe that's the Scottish, chewy white bread roll loving girl in me talking.  On day three everyone was too hungover to go out for breakfast, so I braved the long line alone in search of a Slut. After 10 minutes in line I was about to approach the cashier when another staff member came round and said they were out of Sluts and it'd be a 40-minute wait for more. So much for that! I called an audible for the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, almost the same but with bacon instead of sausage and chipotle ketchup instead of aioli. This one had melted more, though annoyingly the bacon was crammed up one end and I burst the yolk out the side while trying to rearrange things. It was more flavorful (and much saltier) than the sausage, and the chipotle ketchup is definitely a better match to balance out the yolk than the aioli was. Again, the bun didn't fully satisfy me, I just don't think it goes as well with the yolk as another more rustic bread might.   I'm not totally convinced, but still waiting to try that beautiful-looking coddled egg next time!",

We arrived about 15 minutes before their closing time, there was no line at all and the place was pretty much empty. Just 2 other tables.  We just had a late lunch so I didn't order anything because I was still full, but my sister ordered the Bacon Egg & Cheese. She took a few bites and looked mesmerized.. then she told me that I seriously MUST take a bite. I'm not a big burger eater and not a big fan of bacon as I always find them to be too greasy. So I wasn't feeling too excited when she offered me a bite, but when I did take a bite.. man, I almost died. TOO GOOD, TOO GOOD. Still can't believe how good it was and this comes from someone who doesn't normally like burgers or bacon. Still haunted by the perfect marriage of the juicy bacon and the melting egg yolk and melting cheese, oh my God.  Our Vegas trip was short but I'll come back here the next time I'm in town.",

Originally discovered in San Francisco as a food truck, this place went big for its Breakfast sandwiches. Located on the 3rd floor of the cosmo, there was a huge line up- 15 min wait, but the line moved quickly. I ordered the fairfax sandwich (5/5 Chipotle mayo, carmelized onions, cheddar cheese and fluffy scrambled eggs served in between brioche buns) I ordered extra avocado to come with- really adds a nice buttery context without the fat. The sandwich was not too heavy- it was perfect actually, eggs were light and the Chipotle mayo was a fine touch. They serve freshly squeezed organ juice as well. My order came out to around 17$.

The long wait to order combined with the pricey menu are the only thing holding me back from awarding that #5 star, but as far as their fare is concerned- 5 star all the way! They also do not have complimentary water; I offset the cost by bringing my own drink so I can't speak to their OJ, but it's very popular.   My boo and I have tried their classic bacon sandwich and the Fairfax, which I now prefer to order with the mayo spread on the side as it can sometimes have too much, overpowering the delicate chives and tender eggs. Avocado is available for sandwiches, but with their perfectly soft scrambled, cheesy eggs I didn't really think it needed another creamy element. The indulgently buttery bread supports the sandwich perfectly and may be the best part in my opinion, but I think next time I am going to try their signature \"Slut\" to mix it up!   This location is in the Cosmopolitan; walking through the main doors of the Strip, head towards the right staircase and find it on the second floor, near what I can only describe as the back side chandelier bar. If you're parked in their garage, no worries, it will be down a hallway after you exit the elevator on the second floor.. as a matter of fact, you'll know you're in the right place when you see their wraparound line first!",

The menu is limited and it's a simple concept of breakfast sandwiches, but it works! I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and a fresh squeezed orange juice. My sandwich had a pile of bacon, egg, and cheese, with chipotle ketchup on a brioche bun. My fiance got the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. His came with a honey mustard aoili (I think!) on the brioche bun. We also got a biscuit with honey butter to split. The brioche rolls are the star of the show. They are able to carry all of the contents of the sandwich without getting soggy. My mouth is watering just thinking about my sandwich. Next time I go back, I would like to try the Eggslut, which is a layer of mashed potatoes with a poached egg on top. It's served with a side of bread dippers. It looks really good too!",

    "text": "Having followed their Instagram for a while and always drooling over the food poem I was excited to find out they had a location in Vegas during a recent visit there.   We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes in the hallway that wrapped around the corner from the restaurant. It moved at a decent clip.   I shimmied up to the counter and my boyfriend and I ordered the fairfax, the gaucho and one slut because of course we had to try the name sake.   Food came out very quickly and we dug right in. Beware the gaucho is MESSY. You are best off eating this one with a fork and knife unless you are ok with runny egg covering your hands. During the first bite when my boyfriend was still using his hands it burst and went everywhere. After he got the mess under control he said he really enjoyed the sandwich. As for me, I loved the fairfax with the addition of the avocado and bacon. I think it would have been a little plain with out. But I swallowed that thing in three minutes flat. As for the slut, I enjoyed it. Was happy to try it but if ordered alone for a breakfast I don't think you'll be satisfied. It makes a great snack or side to share!  Minus one star for counter cleanliness. These guys are doing a ton of business so it's understandable things are hectic but the high top table where we were eating was out of napkins almost as soon as we sat down and there were crumbs everywhere. A quick a rundown on a regular basis would be helpful. Attention to detail would make this place the standout it should be!",

The slut was cool, but there needs to be more eggs and less potato puree.  Nonetheless, the general experience was nice. Although I do diss the fact that they sell 5 bucks for a small soda, which costs a dollar something in general. So I'm gonna stick with water, which is free from the bar two steps from Eggslut.",

Fortunately it moves rather quickly and they get your food to you pretty fast once you order.  I have tried most of their menu(not too many options) and have never been disappointed. My favorite by far is the \"Bacon, Egg & Cheese,\" with or without avocado it is amazing, and they are super generous with the bacon!   The one item on the menu that I have yet to try is the \"Slut,\" I have no idea why but based on all these reviews I will have to try it next time around.",

It has soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, spicy mayo and cheese but I also add bacon, avocado, and sriracha to make it the best egg sandwich of all time. This place is consistent and has a really fun vibe. The line can be super long but it's worth the wait for the Fairfax. I don't really recommend the slut bc it's so basic. It is like $15 for the Fairfax my way-- expensive but still worth it. The slut is not really worth the price because you can master it at home.",

    "text": "I am officially obsessed with Eggslut. Serving up delicious egg sandwiches and of course the namesake of the restaurant, the \"Slut,\" this place gets long lines and if you try it, you'll see why.  My favorite sandwich to get here is the Gaucho, which involves wagyu tri-tip and chimichurri sauce. The bread on all of the sandwiches is soft, fluffy and is the perfect breakfast bread. I also love getting the Slut. It's mind-blowingly good. A coddled egg is placed on top of a jar of Robuchon (re: SUPER buttery) mashed potatoes. You mix it all together and the egg kind of cooks in with the potatoes. Spread that on the provided toast and you have a party in your mouth. I like getting the arugula salad to put on top of that.  The only bad thing about Eggslut is you can't really get out of there without spending around $20/person for a grab and go breakfast. Also the line. Just try to go on off-peak times (afternoon, early morning...)  There aren't too many seats, so head to the Chandelier bar nearby if you can't find seating at the restaurant.",

Even on a monday morning the line was huge - we waited 30 minutes to place our order. They only had one register open despite the crowd, plus the one register was being worked by a trainee so I am sure that didn't help speed things along.   All three of us went for the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. I was excited to see the sausage was turkey, it seems like more often than not the sausage is pork. My friend doesn't eat pork so she was actually able to enjoy this sandwich. Once we placed our order, it wasn't too much of a wait until we actually got our sandwiches, thank goodness because we were starving by that time!  The quality of the sandwich was good, the bread was delicious and the yolk was gooey just the way I like it. I enjoyed the sandwich but it wasn't worth a 30 minute wait.",

    "text": "Teased by the Cosmo for almost a year, the long awaited Eggslut has finally opened and...  REALLY?!?  There is nothing wrong with the sandwich.  How can you not like soft scrambled eggs imbued with butter, bacon, caramelized onions, melted cheddar cheese and the warm spicy kick of siracha on a fresh, gently sweetened brioche bun (Fairfax)?  Great combo but come on, $12???  A $3 premium over the LA location.  The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (fried egg, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup on a brioche bun) A-OK.  It's a fried egg sandwich.  Eat it quick or the egg yolk will quickly soak into the bun making a soggy mess.  $8.  Finally the \"slut\" (coddled egg on a silky smooth potato puree cooked in a jar) is definitely interesting.  Mix it all up to incorporate the salt, chives, and yolk into the potato then spoon.  Basically a pureed breakfast slathered on a piece of toasted baguette.  Sans the baguette, perhaps in my golden years when the dentures hurt but for now, I prefer solid food.  $10.  To their credit, the applewood smoked bacon is well sourced.  Meaty with controlled salinity.  The eggs (cage free) do have a more pronounced yolky flavor.  A fast food restaurant with fast food friendly service.  A little clumsy but this visit was opening day.  It should improve.  In the end, creative food truck grub at astronomical Vegas resort pricing.    To each his own but this slut is not for me.",

As for the cookie, it was not bad. I can tell they use high quality chocolate and a lot of it. The cookie was a little harder than a prefer but not terrible.

My only gripe would be is that the seating situation is a bit of a struggle.  It would be cool if staff sat us to make sure the patrons with food have a seat rather than people at the back of the line saving seats for those without food.  Other than that... tasty place and I'll be back!",

    "text": "All I can say is the fairfax with sausage is an excellent sandwich.  It's a breakfast sandwich but different than most it has a spicy sauce and runny scrambled eggs rather than an egg that pops.  The eggs with the cheese worked very well and the addition of turkey sausage really worked.  The brioche bun of course is always a plus when doing breakfast.  For $11 the price is steep, especially considering the size.  Quality is there but it just needs to be bigger to more or less be a scrambled egg brunch meal, then worth the price point.  I came at noon on a monday and the line was about 10-15 minutes.  I get a seat immediately though.  The wait time really all depends on if you go during peak breakfast hours or not.  Otherwise it really isn't that much different than a typical restaurant wait.",

Disregard all previous reviews, I will give you reality.   This place is fantastic! Perfect for weekend late night!   The sandwich I had was the cheese, egg, bacon.   It was delicious, and loaded with bacon.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and the bun was soft and fluffy.   The customer service was friendly, and I was greeted with a smile!   The prices are a bit steep, but cmon man... you're in Las Vegas, on the strip, and in the Cosmo.  Next door are $6 tacos, I think we can all afford to shell out $8 for a damn good egg sandwich!   GET THAT EGG SANDWICH AND THANK ALVIN FOR BLESSING US WITH HIS CREATIONS IN VEGAS.",

I generally don't mind waiting for food, but the turkey sausage egg sandwich was such a huge disappointment.   The sandwich itself is placed on a huge brioche bun, that wasn't sweet or pleasantly soft AT ALL.  I mean when I bit into it it tasted slightly stale to me, the turkey sausage was disgusting it was so dry and tasteless and didn't have any sausage flavor whatsoever.  The rest of the sandwich was really disappointing.  I would take a McD sandwich over this any day.    I had a bite of my friends fair fax sandwich and perhaps that would warrant 3 stars, but I think eggslut is way overhyped and not worth the price nor the wait.  I can't believe I paid almost $9 for a nasty dry sausage egg sandwich.  It made for a great photo op but I was not satisfied whatsoever, and I am not the pickiest person at all when it comes to food.   Save your time and money and go somewhere else for breakfast.",

    "text": "Egg slut has been on my \"to try\" list for a while now. I've never been able to make it up to Grand Central Market before there's a long line, I made sure I had to try it when I was in Vegas. I made the mistake of going on a Saturday though when there are a lot more tourists in town - annnnnnd especially going at peak hours...  It's located in the Cosmo on the second floor next to Holstein's and right across from the line to enter Marquee Day Club. When I arrived the end of the line was right in front of the restroom in the adjacent hallway. We got to the counter by a few minutes shy of 12:10PM and then got our food around 12:30PM. There's limited seating but it clears up fast, my boyfriend and I were able to grab 2 bar seats at the counter right after we got our food.   We ordered the gaucho, the cheeseburger, and the slut. I had intended to try their breakfast sandwiches, but I'm not a big cheese person so I felt like I wouldn't be doing their food justice ordering the breakfast sandwiches and opting out cheese... so I decided to get the gaucho. It's waygu tri tip with chimichurri sauce, argula, and an over medium egg. The sandwich was decent, my yolk was on the other side of my sandwich so once I bit into it, it squished the sandwich and caused the yolk to pop and exit out of the sandwich into the wrapper... so I didn't get the full experience :-( it was still good, however I could have used a little more seasoning/salt.  I was looking forward to the slut - we were advised to make sure all layers were fully mixed in together before eating it. After it was all mixed up it kind of reminded me of those fake watery mashed potatoes you'd get from the frozen tv dinners.  Egg slut is good, but from everything I've heard I was expecting it to change my life and it didn't. Maybe if the wait wasn't so long I would have enjoyed it more but being in line in a small hallway next to restrooms wasn't exactly the best precursor to a meal.",

    "text": "Meh. I don't get the hype. This Cali chain has landed, after much anticipation, on the Vegas Strip in the Cosmopolitan. Sure, it was opening day and they were super busy...30 minute line turned into more of an hour wait because one of the employees messd up a sandwich and had to recreate it; backing up the many orders behind. And the manager just stood there with dear in highlights look. Step in and help the guy out DA! My 3 star rating is not due to the wait or less than stellar service. Day 1 = I'm am a reasonable person after all. ;)  3 stars based solely on food quality, creativeness (lack thereof), and cost. Frankly speaking, the most intriguing thing I found about Eggslut was the interesting name - very befitting for Sin City!   Their signature \"Slut\" that's cooked and served in a small jar (think maybe twice the size of a baby food one) in water bath sounded very promising, and I liked the fact you get to keep the cute little jar and lid. Could start a collection. Lol. The dish is simply pureed potates, with one egg on top, garnished with chives, \"gravy salt\" (which I think they forgot) served with a few pieces of EVOO drizzled toasted baguette slices. The egg was completely overcooked - no yolky goodness - and the potatoes were bland. It wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would call phenomenal...by far. It lacked any form of texture (very thankful for the bread) and tasted...well...like baby breakfast food. I bet kids love the \"Slut!\"  In addition, they must be making a killing on markup of packaging and product. Sells the \"Slut\" for $10; probably costs them less than 2 bucks to create. Great business model at least...and they do seem to have an obsessive fan base. Anybody want to go in on a franchise? :P  Next time I feel like eating some slutty cuisine,  I'll just cook naked at home with the windows open...no fried foods of course. Happy noshing!  NOTE: The space is really small and has very little counter seating on one wall. There are seating areas scattered close by in the Cosmo though.",

    "text": "While visiting Las Vegas I really didn't want to venture too far outside of the Cosmopolitan for breakfast, luckily Eggslut was located inside my hotel and it quickly became my go to choice for breakfast.  The concept here is simple with a menu focusing on eggs. For both my visits I went with the standard Bacon, Egg & Cheese and the Sausage, Egg & Cheese. Both sandwiches were served on a warm brioche bun and more than enough to satisfy my hunger until lunch. One morning I did also order a Buttermilk Biscuit, which was served with butter and maple syrup however it wasn't the greatest so I just stuck with a sandwich the following morning. Prices here are rather high, however, nothing is cheap in Vegas so that was expected.  My advice is to arrive early as it gets very crowded and might find yourself waiting in a rather long line, however, don't worry as it tends to move pretty fast. All food here is prepared to order so you know you are getting the freshest sandwich. Overall Eggslut is a solid choice if you are staying inside the Cosmopolitan, I am sure other options could be found in other nearby hotels that are just as good.",

There is something about how they cook their eggs, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

I had the Fairfax with avocado. While the brioche bun was yummy, the scrambled eggs were actually quite bland which really ruined the sandwich since the avocado and cheese don't provide much flavors on their own either. I was actually enjoying the sausage, egg and cheese until my partner mentioned that it tasted like a glorified Egg McMuffin and I slowly realized they were right. Sure, it was better. But $8 worth of better? Not at all.  Overall really over-hyped. Better breakfast and egg sandwiches can be had elsewhere",

The sausage was a little spicy and the egg, perfectly runny (a thicker runny which I like). By the time we were able to order, there were seats that opened up, which was good because they're limited.   For those who haven't been, just know this is more breakfast sandwich than a sit down place with lots of options. But if you want a filling bite to eat before starting the day, this is a good place to try. It's on a floor in the Cosmopolitan which actually is like a trendy food court/alcove with all the places to eat. Yeah, it's all the rage and sometimes that ruins expectations, but I was satisfied.",

All sandwiches are on a brioche bun which is one of my favorites. I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and Gary got the sausage. Mine was decent, but nothing I couldn't make at home. Gary couldn't stand his. His egg was too soft for a medium fried and the sausage had a really weird flavor.   I regret not trying their namesake menu item which is a coddled egg and potatoes puree poached in a jar with grey salt with baguette slices. It might have improved our experience.   They used local farmers and despite the line they move quick. Hence the two stars.",

No wonder this unique dish is named after the eatery itself, Eggslut. A petite glass jar filled with a savory potato puree and poached egg, topped with grey sea salt and minced chives. Served with perfectly toasted baguette (ask for extra!), this dish elevates breakfast to a whole new level.   You will find Eggslut across Marquee night club in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We are so excited to have this most welcomed addition to our favorite Vegas resort which we stay at 4-5 times a year. As I write this review I am already salivating for my next delicious jar tomorrow morning, or perhaps late tonight ;-)  Also noteworthy, orange juice is freshly squeezed (love), bacon is thin, crispy and slightly peppered. Egg sandwiches were really tasty, but I highly recommend their specialty. Service is friendly and accommodating, so don't be deterred by the long line (moves fairly quick). It's worth it!!",

Concept and flavor is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not worthy of being considered breakfast.  It's more of a five or six bite appetizer.

Their food is fresh and clean which is important since the last thing you want to eat after a night of drinking is grimey fast food. Lol truth be told this is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas after hours ;)   Seating: limited in the restaurant but there is a bar across that has ample seating.   Drinks. Coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice.   Recommendations: I don't eat meat so the eggSLUT and the Fairfax Sandwitch are my gotos.   Try it - u won't regret it :)",

    "text": "The eggslut, something akin to coddled egg over mashed potato is a great concept. The execution of it on my visit didn't quite arrive as advertised. The egg was cooked perfectly well. I had to maneuver my way back to the cook station for salt and pepper. The chives and salt were missing from my order, salt and pepper were not on the tables. ??? Eggslut is a really busy place so I wasn't too happy working my way back through the crowd. The mashed potato:good flavor if watery. The fresh orange juice didn't taste fresh. I said to my companion that the flavor was exactly the same as a well-known frozen orange juice concentrate. ??? My friend liked her Gaucho Sandwich order.  I'd definitely go again. Next time I'll double check my order before sitting down to enjoy breakfast.  4 stars for the concept, up vibe, great people-loving staff. Short on execution and price.",

The \"slut\" is a poached egg in a glass jar with potato puree and cheese, the baguette slices were nice and crispy. It was a nice little snack and I saw other items on the menu that I wanted to try too. Lines are very long in the morning, after 12 pm, there's no line at all. Definite must when I come back to Vegas.",

Though the lines are long they move pretty quickly and are very efficient with what they do. We made a bulk order for a group of 7 to bring back up to our rooms and didn't have to wait long at all. I ordered \"the slut\" and it was complete heaven!!!! The perfectly poached egg and baguette was absolutely delicious! I loved how it was filled with mash potato on the bottom as a surprise, this meal definitely fills you up! Not to mention the oh so great buttermilk biscuits and butter. Wow, it is SO big and the butter pairs perfectly with it.  Top it off with iced coffee and it made the perfect breakfast for us. A great place to pick up brunch or breakfast for sure!",

Definitely will try that again.  Gaucho, hmm. Wagyu beef, I would challenge that, it did not have that butteryness like Wagyu beef normally has. Cilantro spread on bun ruined it for me because I hate cilantro. One bite had me cringing. I think using regular iceberg lettuce instead of the arugula would be better too. My opinion. Won't order that again. The bun was superb for both, soft, tasty and easy to eat. It even helps to soak up the juicy flavors.",

We took out time looking at the menu in the front and lots of people beat us to the line. We didn't realize there was a menu in the back were the line started.   We tried the slut which is bread and a jar filled with pureed potatoes and egg on the top. It's really filling. I got this and he fairfax sandwich and I couldn't finish it because it was too heavy! So share with someone. The sandwiches look small on picture but they are pretty damn big. My boyfriend got the biscuit which was $5. It was just ok. I think I would have been better with either side honey, jelly or maybe even syrup cause it was kinda bland for my taste.   Me and my boyfriend order 4 things off the menu, 2 sides and 2 sandwiches. Total was $43 something. It was pricey than I realized. Not something I would buy every morning but worth the money to try.   It's a cute place to eat for breakfast. They have tables right outside of the area. It can fit big groups too! This place is definitely a must try especially if your a foodie or a breakfast lover.

    "text": "So the infamous Eggslut had to be a stop during our visit to Las Vegas. As an avid egg lover, I wanted to see and experience all the hype. The first call out is that the Cosmopolitan is such a sexy hotel and you will find this place on the second Floor by Momofuku.   So I was going to order it's namesake, but the reviews were too mixed for me to dive in. So we ended up going with the burger and the Fairfax with bacon. The Burger was decent and pretty on par. Nothing out of this world that I would say sets it apart from most. So if you want meat, it's a safe bet.   The highlight though was actually the Fairfax. It's built around medium scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, spicy mayo, and bacon to top it off as an add on. The flavors were on point and delicious. Honestly though...you can very easily make it on your own at home. It's more for the experience than the wow factor.   Overall, the price was hefty, but it's on par with most Vegas joints. Service was slow, but keep in mind that the wait times can get long especially in the morning. Definitely recommend trying off peak times for faster service and speed. Worst case scenario, you can do it at home for a fourth of the costs, but I think still an enjoyable experience in the great setting of the Cosmopolitan Hotel!",

I was very lucky and didn't have to wait in line at all, but in the past I've seen and heard of very long lines (though supposedly it moves fast). The breakfast sandwiches are excellent and they're generous with ingredients. They're also very good about customizations, especially since everything is cooked made to order. I've had the bacon and egg sandwich, the Fairfax (plus turkey sausage) and the Slut and would recommend any of them!",

I did have to stand in line this morning for a sandwich, but that's ok; I have the time. Plus, for eggs done perfect then the wait is so worth it!  Now jus let getting to the front of the line; anticipation growing too. The cashier was very friendly and took my order with ease. After paying and getting the receipt I waited for the cooks to do their magic. The smells that tickle my nose are so amazing. The cook was busy and making the guests food. It was the cashier that runs the register and the front counter that placed my food in the bag and handed it to me. With this establishment so busy you would think that they could run two cashiers. Just a suggestion.  With the bag now in my hands I took it to eat in the car since I'm running behind. I had this time around the Eggslut with bacon, egg, and cheese. Yes it is fantastic and messy. It gets all over the place, but that is more of it to enjoy! If I could I would eat all my egg meals here.",

She also got one of their salted chocolate cookie. I tried some of that and it was dang good.  They forgot to give me my sauce and it was a little pricey for what you are getting.

The biscuit was average, but the cookies were heavenly and had to hold myself back from getting more when I saw the line had cleared towards the end of the day.    Overall.  Great quality food that may be slightly overpriced for what it is, but it's Vegas and in the Cosmo so it's to be expected.",

Having had the original Eggslut in LA, I can tell you it's just as good. Don't expect anything fancy, it's just an egg sandwich. But it will be a really, really good egg sandwich. If you don't know anything about the restaurant you'll probably order the Slut, but don't. It's more expensive than anything else on the menu and the portion is really small. But don't get me wrong, it's pretty freakin good.  I like the Fairfax, but pay extra to add meat. The Bacon, egg and cheese is just as good though so if you spent too much in the club, maybe stick to that.  Park in the West side elevators- direct access to Eggslut!",

I have been known to go all sorts of places in LA to try different interesting restaurants. Eggslut was going to be no different. Yet, it was also sort of disappointing. The slut I ordered was exceptionally salty and despite mixing it fairly well, the egg flavor stuck to the top and the bottom tasted more like the potato puree. Not very well balanced. And the salt just dehydrates you especially if you come here after clubbing at Marquee. It's a bit annoying. My friends got the burgers and were less than impressed. Would I ever go out of my way to eat here? No way.  But it was well worth trying.",

Be careful when you take your first bite though because it can get messy (see picture). I can make some rated R comments here but I will refrain.   The only downside is that there are no potato options on the menu (i.e. hashbrowns, potatoes, fries, etc) and I really miss it. Breakfast just doesn't seem complete without it.

    "text": "Honestly I came here because of the name, which I'm sure many, many, many others do based upon the line that formed before and after me. What solidified my coming here was the photos and the menu posted online.  Situated on the 2nd level of the Cosmopolitan on the strip, if you're coming from the Planet Hollywood walkway you'll need to come around the Chandelier bar as it is situated behind it. This is not a sit down restaurant,  you'll need to order at the counter and your name will be called, options are \"for here\" or \"to go\". Seating is available at the perimeter of the space but also across the walkway in an Alice in Wonderland theme space.   My first experience here was the Gaucho, a wagyu tri-tip steak served with a fried egg, served with chimichurri,  red onions, arugula on a brioche bun. The brioche adds a bit of sweet to the savory of the sandwich but the arugula adds a nice bite that finishes the sandwich. I also had housemade buttermilk biscuit which comes with honey butter. It is actually two biscuits. There isnt much to this, it's a buttery-salty biscuit.  But wow, I should have left this as a one hit wonder (I dropped a star). I came back a 2nd time for the Slut, a coddled egg over potato puree, garnished with grey salt and chives. Its served with some toasted baguette.  This was a disappointing experience,  I had ordered a side of bacon which I watched plated and set aside minutes before my Slut was ready, by the time I got the order the bacon was room temperature and loosing its crispness that I like. And although I grabbed my dish right away the baguette was cold! Who wants crusty cold, seemingly stale bread. At least the potato puree had flavor, I mixed egg and puree together to dip my bread into however eventually used a spoon to slather it on.   Overall the name is enticement,  I'd say come here for the fun and be prepared to stand in line. They work pretty quickly so it's not a long wait, but when in Vegas have some fun, be an eggslut.",

We got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, fairfax sandwich, one of their specialty called slut, and salted chocolate chip cookie. The slut is an egg in a glass jar with their own homemade potatoes puree with several slices of baguette. This was decently good but probably something we will only order once to try out. The fairfax sandwich was also good but the bacon, egg, and cheese was absolutely delicious! They give you a lot of bacon! The salted chocolate chip cookie was also good. They warmed it up for you and had a nice chewy texture to it.   Overall, I would come here again. Service was phenomenal and it didn't take long for your food.

We got a cheeseburger and a bacon-egg-cheese. The brioche buns were perfectly flaky, croissant-like almost. The oozing yolk from the egg helped bring everything together. So good! One thing I'd change about the cheeseburger is to not the use the sweet kind of pickle.   Midweek line stretched around the corner into the hallway around lunch, but it went super quick. Kitchen staff was efficient as heck so we got our food quick. Only problem was we came in hungry and left still hungry! An excuse to come back and try other menu items I suppose",

It's well-known and I would have kicked myself for not giving it a chance.  I got the Fairfax with greens instead of a bun and it was a comforting and semi-healthy delicious breakfast. The eggs were out of this world delicious however when the menu says \"caramelized onions\" I am expecting more than ONE. Seriously? Look at the picture.  He got the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese and was happy with it. He said the bacon was of great quality.  The cashier was so friendly, but the woman calling out orders was useless because she wasn't doing her one job-calling out orders. She was talking to a friend while everyone's orders sat under heat lamps. I was able to easily identify our order because mine was the only one without a bun. I gave her a few minutes and when I saw she wasn't going to call my order, I just walked over and said \"can I just take this then?\"  Her response: \"oh yeah. Go ahead.\"  Useless. And during a breakfast rush, no less.  Naturally, the items weren't hot (do you see the cheese in mine LOL) and, again, what is up with my complete lack of onions? For $34?  I tried it but I don't think I'd return.   If you go, watch your order like a hawk and grab it before it shrivels up under the heat lamps so the employee can laugh it up with her friend and get paid for doing nothing.",

It stretched to the bathroom but it didn't feel too long of a wait.   I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. It seems pretty basic (possibly a little pricey but cheaper than most places in Vegas) but everything was done so well. I'm not even the type to like ketchup in my sandwiches (and totally missed that part in the menu) but it blended in with everything. I actually didn't notice it until the end. The bread was so soft. Overall, the meal was flavorful and fulfilling.   There's a huge long communal table in egg slut but across there's some other tables and seats (Alice in wonderland theme?? and some egg seats!). Check this place out at least once during your stay!",

The line was only 3 deep; unheard of I know. Lol.   We ordered a few things. The only reason why I'm giving 4 star & not 5 is the overall service. They forgot my bacon on my sandwich and gave it to me in the side. I think that is huge lack of service when you are expecting this place to be the best of the best.   I got The Fairfax Sandwich & the Biscuit with delicious honey butter. My buddy got sausage egg cheese. The bread in general is absolutely to die for. The overall food, good, but not worth the $40 price tag. I thought that was a bit much even inside a Hotel to be honest.   Im glad I gave it a shot as it was definitely an overall good experience. Not sure how fast I'll return however I appreciate the tasty, creamy delicious flavors.   Thanks Team Eggslut",

It did move fast though.   I went with the bacon and egg on gf bread. My husband got the Fairfax with sausage. He had a cold brew and I did the orange juice. I had a bottle of champagne in our room that I wanted to make mimosas with, so that worked out well   The bill was around 30, which was super affordable.    The best part?  The food was amazing.

Well I ordered a cheeseburger w bacon  I don't wanna b mean but this just sucked. It was wierd. As the bun was fresh, pickles were on point. Everything about this burger was great except the patty; and that is in fact the burger.  This meat was so over cooked and dry.  I was chocking. The patty was thinner than a Mc Donald's cheeseburger patty??? How's that possible???   I'm not saying this is a bad place.  I haven't tried other items.  I am saying the cheeseburger sucked.  Sometimes unfortunately a restaurant has a great name and location w no pride in what they serve.  I get it. They'll still make $ off the tourist.",

    "text": "It sometimes pays to be slutty, especially in Vegas, am I right?  Well..the only slutty I was getting on during my quick Vegas trip out was having some yolk porn ooze all down my face from Eggslut's sandwich.    Even though I went to bed late (for me, I'm a youngish mom to an almost 2 year old after all) I couldn't sleep more than 5-6 hours, so I decided to head to Eggslut after 7ish.  There were only a few people waiting for their orders, it was early after all plus a Thursday morning.  I couldn't decide between the Slut, which was a coddled egg with potato puree served in a glass jar with baguette slices or the Bacon + Egg + Cheese sandwich.  Tough choice, but you rarely can go wrong with bacon and a yolky egg, so I went with the latter.  After a few minutes my order was ready.    Instead of eating it on the table tops there I went to the seating near by since The Cosmo is so awesomely aesthetic.  The bacon was nice and crisp, and the egg, cooked perfectly where the yolk bursted when I bit into it.  The cheddar cheese was a nice accompaniment but wish it was melted a bit.  I didn't really notice much flavor in the chipotle ketchup.  I saw the cook warming up the brioche bun on the flattop but honestly it could've used some butter or some kind of spread to liven it up.  The brioche itself didn't feel very warm and it was just too heavy.  I was tempted to get it bunless as they do offer that as an option at no extra cost, but with the over medium egg, it would get super messy, so I decided to skip.  It was a hearty sandwich that kept me going until I finally got home around 4pm and was under $10.  A steal for the Cosmo.  Happy I finally got to try Eggslut.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm on the Strip!",

There was a short line, but it moved fast since the menu was very concise, there weren't many customization options to consider, orders were taken efficiently, and the kitchen pumped out food at very steady pace.  The wife and I shared a Fairfax ($8, soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun) w/bacon (add $3) and a Slut ($10), a coddled egg on top of potato puree cooked in a small Mason jar topped with chives and served with a toasted baguette slices.  Our Fairfax was hot, fresh, and satisfying, but messy and somewhat difficult to eat trying to keep it all together.  The light, airy brioche bun was the True star of the sandwich.  The Slut was simple, yet delicious.  Honestly, it outshined the Fairfax by a country mile.  Was Eggslut a bit overpriced?  Perhaps, but I thought their use of fresh, quality ingredients justified the price.  Is Eggslut a horrible name for restaurant?  I'm no prude, but it may be off-putting to some, which would be a shame since Egglut is easily the best place for breakfast at the Cosmo.",

Eggslut fits the bill, with super soft brioche buns, cheesy eggs, and fatty meats. Before 8am is super fast service. Even long lines move quickly, but for coffee, visit the smoothie shop down the way. $4.00 for an 8 oz coffee is more than I wanted to pay, and the coffee wasn't exceptional OR strong.  My friend had the eggslut cup, which is basically mashed potatoes with a coddled (soft-cooked, almost raw) egg on top. She enjoyed it, but the look of the running yolk didn't do me any 8am favors.   The line got long on Saturday morning about 8:15 and it took about 15 minutes to order after being wrapped down the hallway, but only 5 minutes for my food. Don't order this via room service, or it will take an hour!   Try the Fairfax with bacon and avocado.  Next time: the burger.",

    "text": "In the words of Mr. Peabody, adequate but hardly extraordinary.   I did relish placing my order with the cashier, \"I'll have a slut please.\" Too easy, I know. I kept a straight face. After picking it up I found one of the few seats remaining and sat down. Across from me were three rotund black women, all enjoying their own breakfasts as well. The lady in the middle asked me what I was eating?   \"A slut,\" I answered.   \"I bet you didn't know you was gonna eat one,\" and she began to laugh. As did I. She had me there.   Ok, this is fast food done reasonably well. You can ignore all the reviews about it costing too much. Tell me something that doesn't in this town. You come here to have fun; never mind the cost. Having said this, Eggslut might have opted for the small Mason jar instead of the teeny-weenie size. But they are selling plenty of them so don't imagine they will be upsizing anytime soon.  Or maybe a larger jar would require two eggs to get the egg-potato ratio just right. So then charge more (not that I know anything about the restaurant business).  The slut doesn't seem to be mashed potatoes with a soft boiled egg, but rather just potatoes cooked right, pureed, chives and salt added. Potatoes could have been a little warmer. Egg properly coddled. All in all, it was good enough.   Did also have the biscuits--okay but not perfect. But you might like them.   Not sure I'd go out of my way for Eggslut, but in the neighborhood? Sure.",

The signature Slut is awesome, that's a given, but make sure you let your wife get that and you get yourself a \"Gaucho\" sandwich (and add bacon to that, it's a must!). Tender, perfectly cooked meat on a great brioche bun. And the staff was a blast, we enjoyed the laughs. And decent prices considering it's on Strip in the Cosmo  My only requests: 1) you guys should bust out an in-house made hot sauce. I mean you're serving egg sandwiches, right? Blow our minds with a little homemade zip. 2) I'd love a little more on the salad. It was a delicious dressing, tasty cheese, arugula... but that was it. Another ingredient or 2 would be fabulous.   Thanks much! We'll be back again for sure.",

The meat was really tasty and you could tell it was high quality. The brioche bun was nice and crunchy. The other components were not as successful. The egg was not as runny as I would have liked it to be. The biggest buzzkill for me was the amount of arugula on the sandwich (admittedly arugula isn't my favorite). The sandwich was overloaded with it and the flavor overwhelmed the rest of the components flavors. Overall I don't think I'd come back. The line was too long and the food was not cheap.

The line moves fast, & this seems to be pretty unanimous opinion among other yelpers. The coffee is actually outstanding, and dont skip the cookie or the biscuit with honey butter either. The breakfast sandwich was also baller. I recommend to a friend. :)",

I do not have a problem paying premium prices for a premium experience, however I paid $10 for a brioche bun, one egg, a slice of cheese and a turkey sausage patty that was literally so tough I could not chew it. Had I ordered my sandwich at the location and eaten it there I would have taken it back to the counter and asked them to make me another one without the turkey sausage, it was so tough. That being said I totally understand that this is Las Vegas and prices are through the roof, but I expected more and I definitely didn't get it.

When we arrived the line was about 50 people deep and I gave him the wifely death stare but we had walked so far - I wasn't turning around at this point.   I ordered the Fairfax and he ordered the Sausage egg and cheese. What makes the sandwiches are the fresh backed bread and fresh ingredients. So tasty!  So, don't hesitate because of the line or the name - well worth the wait.",

This restaurant would more than likely be successful off the Strip as well because the the name recognition and good food. The prices were inflated because of the Strip crowd but that is to be expected.   Hidden gem of a menu item is the biscuit with honey butter. A great compliment to any order.",

Located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel. If you are not there when they open, expect a line. Seating is limited at the Eggslut but they're open spots to sit on the second floor of the cosmopolitan.   I will definitely be back. And I look forward to trying the gaucho sandwich.

Sausage, egg & cheese sandwich - $8.50 Cheeseburger (added bacon) - $13.50 Gaucho sandwich - $15 Slut - $10.50  When we picked up our food, the lady asked if it was our first time. For the \"slut,\" she told us to break the yolk and mix it around. This particular item was pretty good & unique (coddled egg, potato puree, chives & gray salt) but I felt like the other items were just average tasting. There was nothing special about the sandwiches & burger. Service and everything was fine but pretty pricey and a bit overrated in my opinion.",

We tried to get some biscuits, but they'd sold out, so we had to get there the next time super early, and let me tell you, those sandwiches and biscuits are LIFE. The egg salad is creamier than I'm used to, and they give you a lot of it, so have napkins on your lap. I went back twice for biscuits, which are as big as your palm. Will definitely be going there again.  Heads up - the line gets long pretty fast, so if you're an early bird, it's best to get there around 7-8am if you want a biscuit. They'll be sold out by 11am. Trust me. They close at 7pm and reopen at midnight, so if you're coming in from a night of partying and want a bite, this is perfect.",

    "text": "I think this place is mainly all hype due to its name and it being all trendy. My fiance and I were referred to this place and didn't realize how long the lines were. Expecting it to be decent considering the \"rave\", all we got was just an average egg sandwich.   My fiance got the Fairfax and I got the Slut since those two were suppose to be their popular offerings.  Both were just OK at best and really overpriced. I'm not sure waiting in line for 30 mins would be worth it especially the cost. The drawback isn't mainly due to cost, but the cost for what you're getting. I can't value an egg sandwich that is just average to cost this much -- just as you probably won't spend $20 on a McMuffin if it were to cost that much.   If you haven't have to wait in a long line and it was cheaper, then I can recommend it if you're craving an egg breakfast sandwich, otherwise I wouldn't recommend.    If you absolutely have to try it, then by all means do so. Just understand that it's just a hip and trendy establishment.",

    "text": "It is genius to have this place open up at midnight every day. When the clubheads leave Marquee they come out and see delicious sandwiches and sluts being prepared.  The namesake \"Slut\" is a coddled egg on top of potato puree, with chives and sea salt. It's served in a glass jar because that's what foodies/hipsters love and makes their IG pic look delicious AF. Luckily, it's just as tasty as any filter would make it look. My only complaint would be that I wish I had more baguettes to eat it with. Make sure to use the spoon before eating to break the egg and mix it throughout with the potato puree.  I've also had both the sausage, egg, and cheddar sandwich along with the bacon and egg sandwich. These are both good deals for the price (~$8), and I suggest a full meal would be one slut and one sandwich (two sandwiches and a slut if two are dining).  There are long lines in the morning, as I've waitied up to 45 minutes, so ask yourself if it's worth the wait. Shorter lines at night if you're looking for some drunk food. Eggslut has definitely been added to my rotation.",

A couple behind me asked an employee walking out of the side door about how long it would take to get to the front.. He responded an hour (a few minutes later the couple left the line). To my surprise the line moved quickly and only took 30 minutes to get to the front. I got the \"slut\" and my husband got the cheeseburger. Both cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Well worth it! Don't let the line scare you away.",

    "text": "Based on the name alone this place belongs in Vegas. I'm from the East Coast and have never heard of Eggslut. I'm glad we tried it.  First the GOOD: We found the quality and taste of our meals to be very, very good. I had the Slut (I had to write that once) which is basically an egg over easy on top of potato puree in a small glass jar with slices of a bagugette. It was hot and smelled wonderful. The flavors together were so good. My friends each had the egg and cheese sandwich with turkey sausage. They loved the flavor and how hardy it was. There is some seating or you can mosey on over to the Chandelier Bar and have a couch seat (they didn't seem to mind).   Now for the NOT SO GOOD: We went at 9am on a Thursday morning. The line was 45+ minutes which we expected. After about 10 minutes I walked to the front of the line just to see what was going on. The assembly line of cooks and food prep people was being run well, like a military line. The problem seemed to be the ONE person taking the orders. There were 2 stations to take orders but only one employee. He was very nice but slow and if someone ordered a drink, he would have to stop what he was doing and make their drink! Operationally, they need to have someone else (a kitchen person) making the drinks so he doesn't have to stop taking orders. I would also suggest they have an employee walk down the line taking some orders on paper to make the transactions quicker when they get to the register.  Also - I wasn't going to clean my glass jar and take it back to New York but I felt badly just throwing it out. They need a recycle bin for these jars next to the garbage cans.  Overall - I can't wait to dine here again when I'm back in Vegas. Maybe I'll get lucky and Eggslut will open in New York City. No joke necessary!",

The bun was just way to thick for what I was eating, the bacon was fatty (had to remove a bunch from my sandwich) and the egg was nothing special just an over medium egg.   The side of butter milk biscuit was so disappointing  in the texture.  We ended up paying $35 dollars for 2 sandwiches a biscuit to split and two iced coffees.   Pass!!   Bye Felicia!",

Everything is made to order, so it's understandable that it would take time, and luckily the line goes by pretty fast.   I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, and it was pretty good! My only complaint is that the sausage had a pretty strong herbal (sage? basil?) taste that didn't really pair super well with the rest of the flavors. I had a bite of my boyfriend's Fairfax with bacon and that was really good! Perfectly cooked soft scrambled eggs are a lot less messy than an over easy egg, and I thought the bacon was the better tasting protein option.",

My ONLY complaint is the smell of old egg on the counter tops. I'm personally not a fan of the smell of eggs if they have not been properly cleaned off a counter top. It's usually the over easy eggs when the yolk doesn't get properly cleaned up. For this reason, my girlfriend and I had to find a table away from Eggslut.

Even at 7am when you first open your wings, them buns should be perfectly fresh, that's the least I expect from a place with the line around the corner.  Otherwise, it's worth the wait. The sandwich is light and not to heavy. If you want to filler up, I suggest you get a sandwich and an additional item to make it complete. By the way, that OJ tasted glorious.

Who wakes up this early as a traveler?!   I ordered the Fairfax sandwich and the egg salad sandwich. The egg salad was pre-made, like tuna fish in a can, and scooped onto a toasted bun with arugula on top. I usually never eat egg salad because of the amount of mayo but this egg salad wasn't over bearing. Not something I would recommend for a list try. As for the Fairfax sandwich, it's hard to go wrong with the taste of eggs. The flavor wasn't anything spectacular and the bun were just toasted buns.   What's with all the hype about this joint? There are better breakfast joints around.",

    "text": "Delicious egg sandwich place in Las Vegas! We visited around 10:30 on a Friday and it only took 20ish minutes to get to the front of the line and then an additional 10 minutes to receive our food. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with turkey sausage which was delicious! The flavors worked together really well, especially the caramelized onions and sriracha mayo, and the sandwich was plenty big for me to feel full but not stuffed. The downside is that the sandwich was very messy, making it difficult to eat. What made it even harder was that there isn't enough seating for everyone, so my friends and I sat on a couch and had to eat the sandwiches in our laps. While Eggslut may be trying to market as more of a grab and go place, I don't think egg sandwiches would taste as good cold. Therefore, I recommend they add some more seating in order to get that 5 star review! Another con is that they don't serve cups of water so I had to buy a Smartwater for $4.50. With a $11.50 sandwich and a $4.50 Smartwater, the price of a quick breakfast really adds up!  Food - 4.5 stars Price - 3.5 stars Service - 3.5 stars Atmosphere - 3 stars",

There was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad because the line moves quickly.  We tried the sausage egg and cheese and the fairfax! Both were good. We wanted to try the slut, but they ran out of bread for it. Given the wait and the volume of food they have to make, I was really impressed by how quickly the food came out!  Overall, eggslut is worth trying at least once. But if you're tired and hungover and want food ASAP - go somewhere else. I think a McDonalds breakfast sandwich would have tasted just as good in the moment. Eggslut's wait is not worth it!",

The potato puree went so well with the egg, really surprising at how good those two went together. It was topped with chives and some sea salt. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much salt, and I had already mixed it all in. I wish there was an option to add shredded bacon to it, that is the only way it could've been improved upon.   It also came with three or four small slices of toasted and buttered baguette.

Now for the slut , I was curious about the name. I'm sure there is a history on it, but I'm not sure why they would name it that. Regardless, it was surprisingly pretty good! Such a simple idea, mashed potatoes and an egg coddled.  Mix it together and you get this smooth flavorful spread for toast.   I would say a definite must visit place when in vegas.

Then, after waiting over 30 minutes in line, you only have one size option for coffee. Ok, I understand that it helps move the line along ( I'd hate to see their line get any slower!), but for $5, I was very disappointed to get a very small cup of coffee.

I had debated getting their (possibly signature) dish that features an egg inside a glass jar with potato puree BUT talked myself out of it at the last minute and got their breakfast sandwich with bacon, an over medium egg, and some caramelized onions. Lucky for us, my friend and I got a free egg sandwich coupon while we stood in line, so we each only paid about 5$ ( can't complain about that). The sandwiches, however, were a little disappointing. They make all of their eggs ongoing in anticipation of people ordering them and then they assemble the sandwiches as they are ordered. This would be fine, except the sandwiches are never heated through again, leaving the premade eggs/bacon/ etc to be cold with the cheese not even being melted on the sandwich. What a bummer. I think the flavor of the food was good, but it needed to be thrown under their salamander for a minute to get the gooey melty cheese goodness that is essential to a great egg sandwich (IMO). Also...they had no salt and pepper out....so weird for an egg place. I would still consider a return visit, maybe they'll work these kinks out as the restaurant gets older.",

I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Seriously, I could have paid a fraction of the price for something similar at a donut shop.

    "text": "Great concept, but waited way too long for an overpriced pretty delicious egg sandwich. We hit it at one of its busiest times, Sunday morning around 10am. The line was long but was moving fast so we decided to wait. The line itself only took 10 mins to put our order in, but took an hour to actually get our sandwiches. We ordered the Farifax one with bacon and one with sausage (the bacon was better). Their whole process seemed very well done at first, but since we were standing their for an hour we really got to see a lot. I would say they need a better way to actually get the sandwiches out to the customers. Meaning your order should have a number not a name. People with the same name were getting confused. All together a number would be nice to give you an idea of how much longer till you get your own order. I would say to some it all up, if it's not too busy than try it it really is a tasty sandwich, but If it's slammed better to keep walking.",

    "text": "~~~The SLUT and Me, It Was Meant To Be~~~  Finally, a second chance for the SLUT. I had an opportunity several years ago to experience the SLUT in DTLA. I took one look at the SLUT and said, 'No Thank You.' I needed something that was going to  satisfy my hunger pang after battling LA's infamous 110 fwy traffic into DTLA. I settled for the Fairfax with Arugula Salad. It was pretty tasty but not awesome enough to deal with the traffic and updated parking fees. Oh yeah, and another reason I flaked out on the SLUT was because I knew if I didn't like it, I'd be extremely upset, also considering the price tags on these babies.   Whoever said it wasn't busy in the morning was Completely Off. It was Hella Busy with a Long ASS line on a Monday morning. Was it worth waiting 20 mins for their famous SLUT? Is it worth waiting that long in the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racer at Disneyland? Hellz Yeeeah!!   If you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, definitely try the SLUT @ EGGSLUT. Be sure to ask for extra baguette, they'll hook you up at no additional charge. As for their pricing on regular coffee, $4.50?? We decided to take our SLUTS down the escalator into Starbucks. Remember to show your players card for Identity Points (5pts per dollar spent).  Mmmm, I really enjoyed the SLUT. If you're a fan of grits, arroz caldo, and runny egg, you might be in for a nice surprise. The coddled egg sitting on top of hot pureed potato, sprinkled with chives with 5 slices of toasted baguettes drizzled with olive oil. Imo, Amazing! I'd definitely stop by this location whenever I'm back in Vegas. Maybe even make my way into DTLA.",

Umm my morning would have been just fine if you would do your job instead of trying to chit chat with your coworkers. But their \"excellent\" customer service doesn't end there. No then as we're waiting for our food we notice that 4-5 people who ordered after us received their food and we were still waiting on ours. My husband noticed a bag just sitting on the counter that had been there for a few minutes. He goes to ask the girl calling out orders and she says yeah yours is right here. He told her he saw her set it done and not call out any name. She just says \"oh sorry.\" First and last time coming here. McDonald's down the road has better service than this place. We ordered a Fairfax + turkey sausage and the sausage egg & cheese. The food is greasy, falls apart and isn't even worth $5. It's really just hyped up.",

The line was about 20 minutes long for starters, the cashier rushing myself and the group we went with to order.   Overlooking the menu, their item choice was sub par for what is supposed to be a culinary ride in Las Vegas. The seating was crowded, the tables taking most of the small space as we sat after ordering. A slut for me, as the restaurants specialty item, and a 15 minute wait.   The food was disappointing when coming out, three stale biscuits with a small preservative jar and filled with an overheated poached egg on a small cardboard tray. The meal was messy, not filling or appetizing, and honestly underwhelming for the huge hype that followed.   For $10 I would not suggest it and would avoid Eggslut entirely for service.",

Weekend morning lines can be long (down the hallway and practically funneling into the nearby bathrooms). To avoid the weekend line & still enjoy your morning Eggslut...set an alarm and head here early (came by on a Sunday morning and ordered without a wait).  The Slut :A coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. It's a glorified mashed potato dish.  Playful presentation in a glass jar, but I probably wouldn't order again.  The Fairfax: scrambled eggs, carmelized onions, cheddar, chives and sriracha mayo sandwiched in a soft brioche bun. I believe this is the best egg sandwich Egglsut offers. Can be a bit messy to eat, but they serve it with a fork for a reason. . Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich: Hardwood smoked bacon, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun. Just a basic breakfast sandwich, nothing extraordinary about it.   Salted chocolate chip cookie: Dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt. Nice combination of crunchy, sweet, and salty. Not worth $4.50, but a decent choice if you need a sweet bite after your meal.  *Buy your drinks elsewhere. Their cups are TINY.",

For nearly $9 bucks this vegetarian egg sandwich consist of cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. As delicious as this sandwich is... honestly its just an egg sandwich! Would I order it a gain absolutely! Would I wait in line 1 1/2 hours... absolutely not!",

The kitchen is in sight so I saw them making my sandwich and was very pleased with what I saw. The same person handled my sandwich from start to finish, he had gloves on and everything was on a tray and kept separate from all the other bread items. It was a fairly large sandwich for breakfast and it was awesome!! Everyone else in my party had the gluten-y versions and they were all very happy too. I will definitely be back any time that I'm in Vegas",

The portion size was small and the egg itself was small. The coddled egg was prepared well, but most of the jar was the potato puree, so I felt like I was paying $10-$11 for pretentious mashed potatoes that didn't taste like anything special. Probably would have been better off with one of their breakfast sandwiches.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3-3.5",

It is pretty easy to find - just look for the long line! It does move relatively quick - My friend and I  went around 10am on a Friday and we waited about 20min or so. I imagine at peak times, the wait could easily be 30-40min.   I ordered the sausage egg & cheese sandwich while my friend got the Gaucho on a salad (instead of the brioche bun).  We also got the SLUT to share because it seemed like it was must try item. Honestly, it looked really small and not worth it but somehow it works! I kind of wish there were a few more baguette slices to dip into it though. You are suppose to return the jar for recycling / reuse but I suppose you could keep it as a little souvenir?   There is limited seating but the turnaround is pretty quick - it feels more like a more a grab & go or a quick bite type of place.   Overall, it's a pricey breakfast sandwich place but I feel like the quality justifies it. We also really did enjoy the SLUT and would go back just to have that again.   Side note: There was no free (tap) water...then again not many things are in Vegas! We couldn't justify spending $4.50 on bottled water so we just got beer at Walgreens afterwards haha. Only in Vegas...get that party started :D",

My friend suggested we check it eggslut so we made our way over from Planet Hollywood to the cosmo. We didn't know anything about this place so we were surprised to see it was a little stand where you order and pick up food. We were also pleasantly surprised there was no line (like I said we were up early because of the time difference) we ordered the slut and the gaucho to split along with some juice and cold brew.   Everything was super good! We should have gotten one more item to share because the portions were pretty small. I definitely suggest checking this place out it's quick, delicious, small portions so you can either fill up or have a light breakfast and very laid back. Perfect morning pick me up to get the day going in Vegas.",

The soft scrambled eggs were so creamy and really lived up to their name. My husband got The Gaucho and he really enjoyed it as well. I was most blown away by the biscuit and the HONEY BUTTER, what??? I've never even heard of honey butter, but it was so amazing. I need to know where to buy it. Orange was good but not worth the 5 dollars! Overall when we entered the line it was all the way to the back by the bathrooms. We waited a total of about 35 minutes (to order and get our food). Not bad at all. Line moves fast so definitely give this place a try if you're by The Cosmopolitan.",

It's a little expensive but the best money I have ever spent on sausage egg and cheese sandwich. If u have a chance to stop in, its definitely worth a try!",

Delicious as always, my reason for docking a star is that it seems like the sandwiches were made haphazardly. My Fairfax had all the avocado in one chunk on one side and all the caramelized onion was on another side,  whereas I would've preferred they be evenly distributed across the sandwich.   OJ and cookie are both great!   Restro is located on the second floor near a number of other eateries and right next to the Chandelier Bar.",

I said to myself, if there's a long line, this place must be promising! Fortunately, the line cut down fairly quickly. I waited roughly 15 minutes before placing my order.  I ordered the Sausage egg and cheese sandwich which is a turkey sausage patty served in a warm brioche bun. The best part of the breakfast sandwich was the honey mustard aioli sauce, I can't stress how flavorful and creamy this sauce was. It definitely brought the sandwich together. Each sandwich is paired with a house specialty sauce so I'd be interested in trying out the other sandwiches as well.  The workers were very friendly and you can't beat the classy atmosphere of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I look forward to returning!",

    "text": "Heard the hype, worth the wait?  To begin with, I was in Las Vegas for the the Labor Day weekend. Yes, I was getting roasted like a sweet potato throughout my stay.... how do people get used to the 100+ degree weather?! Anyways, my girlfriend and I decided to escape the heat and grab food. I knew Eggslut was located in the Cosmopolitan, and my friends spoke about how great it was-- so there we went!  Thankfully, the line wasn't too long. I believe I only waited about 10 minutes to order my food. Anyways, I went with the Bacon, Egg, & Cheese sandwich and the Slut. To begin with, I started with the Slut since that's what the place is named after. I did enjoy the coddled egg and the yolk mixing with the creamy potatoes on the bottom- all of which was well seasoned. The mixture of the two created a nice mouthfeel and the textural contrast with the baguette slices worked very well here. I do wish a couple more pieces of bread were given here as I was left with a fair amount of potatoes/egg without baguette slices remaining.  For the sandwich, I was extremely underwhelmed. I should have gone with a different sandwich as this one is so simple and can be easily done at home. In my opinion, the best part was the brioche bun as its buttery and fluffy texture provided the ideal vessel for its contents. I do think the inclusion of the chipotle ketchup doesn't work here as it overpowers the other components of the sandwich.  Overall, I think the food provided was just run of the mill and would not be worth the 30+ minute wait that this location can have. The Slut was good and a different experience, but it didn't blow me away. The Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich was not good. Regardless, I would still like to try other menu items down the line to see if I had just picked the wrong items. Until next time!",

Consisting  mainly sandwiches  there are six different kinds that range from $8 to $15.  There is a a couple special, Eggslut and  House-made Buttermilk Biscuit.    The slut is a steamed egg on top of mashed potatoes with chives.   The specials is what we ordered.  You have to know you are LV.  Things are going to be pricey if you're coming into hotels on the main strip.  With that said.  I did not find the Eggslut special neither the Biscuits.  I love breakfast.  They're the best meal of the day for me.  These just didn't have what I liked.  They were prepared well.  Cooked well.  Tasted good too.   Maybe if I tried something else other than their specials.

I had been wanting to try Eggslut for a while during visits in Los Angeles, and never had the opportunity. After seeing one was near my hotel in Vegas, I immediately knew I needed to try.   I went around 8:30 am on a Wednesday, and probably waited in line for 10 minutes (while the line may look long it moves pretty quickly). Almost as soon as you walk over to the pick up counter, your order is ready.   The sandwich itself is excellent - the bun is very fresh while the sausage itself is very flavorful. The sauce truly ties it all together. Overall, definitely try when you're in Vegas as the lines will be much longer in LA.",

They have a menu in the hallway where you wait, so you'll be able to decide what you want before you get to the register.   We ordered the Fairfax Sandwich and the Sausage, Egg & Cheese. It was a short wait before the food was ready. There's a handful of counter seating at Eggslut but there were also some tables and comfy seating nearby. It's an Alice in Wonderland theme called \"Down the Rabbit Hole\".   I have to admit, the sandwiches were a lot smaller than I expected. The Fairfax Sandwich was pretty tasty. The soft scrambled eggs was cooked just the right amount where it was still a little wet, but not overcooked. The Sausage, Egg & Cheese had the over medium egg which got gooey as soon as you bit into it. For both, the brioche bun was very fluffy, but it was a bit dry for my taste.   Overall, the food wasn't too bad. The wait to order the food was a bit long. If it's a long line, I don't think it's worth the wait.",

Although it was $4 for a piece of bread, it was well worth it.   Definitely a must try!",

    "text": "Whenever I'm in Vegas I usually find myself eating/drinking inside the Cosmopolitan. As I have mentioned in earlier Vegas reviews, this particular hotel has a lot of suitable options depending on your budget. For the more affordable breakfast option Eggslut comes highly recommended. This is the NV outpost of the famous restaurant located inside Grand Central Market in LA.  LOCATION: 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan.  Keep in mind that whenever you go there will always be a line. My party arrived at a Thursday morning in July but we still had to wait at least 10 minutes in line. Fortunately the line goes quickly but I can't comment on how the line is during peak periods.  The common sandwiches are the sausage/bacon, egg and cheese, Fairfax and Gaucho. All come in their signature warm brioche bun.  - Fairfax (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun, $8.75). For an additional price you can add avocado or bacon. I added avocado, which cuts into the onion and eggs. Everything jived together to make a filling sandwich.  - Slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette, $10.75). This is their signature product. Think of this as mashed potatoes with the gravy being the coddled egg. It's good as a side but is not filling by itself.  Eggslut is best consumed as hangover food, especially if you plan to do a bar crawl inside the Cosmo or around the Strip as Secret Pizza (the other cheap eats place) doesn't open until 11.",

I arrived at about 8 am on a weekday and there was a line but it moved pretty quickly.   I got the Fairfax Sandwich and added bacon (of course) along with a Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. I think my total ended up being $17 which is a little crazy. The sandwich was tasty, I enjoyed the sriracha mayo a lot, but it wasn't as amazing as everyone made it out to be. It wasn't bad, but just not 5 star worthy.   I also ended up going to Bruxie down the strip and thought it was way better and definitely 5 star worthy!",

The Slut is probably the most ordered item and if it's your first time, I would recommend trying it. It's not enough for a meal and this review was docked a star because of how little avocado was given as an add-on. I think there's too much potatoes and it kind of masks the egg.   What I wish I ordered was the breakfast sandwiches. Those looked so hearty and filling and I regretted not trying those instead.",

I've heard amazing things about Eggslut, so I decided to order breakfast there the first day of my stay at the Cosmopolitan. I made my way to the restaurant around 8 am. There was already a line wrapped down the hallway. Worth the wait tho, I soon discovered.  The menu is pretty tight - which to me is a sign of excellence when there isn't too much to choose from. I was debating between a sausage egg and cheese - but my heart kept gravitating towards the gaucho.  What's that, you may ask? It's seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg in a warm brioche bun. HOWEVER I was trying to experience balance, so I got the sandwich as a salad bowl. You'd think that was boring, but honestly it was outstanding.  I felt like I had the most wonderful steak and eggs - super tender steak, sexy runny #yolkporn, chimichurri. I guess I'm keto now?  Would totally recommend Eggslut if you're staying in the Cosmopolitan. The food comes out pretty speedily and the line moves quick.",

I was wrong !!! I had 10 before me in the line . I had the sausage cheese sandwich and my husband had the fair fax sandwich. And the SLUT . Do not miss the SLUT for anything . It is beautifully prepared and the potato puree blends with the egg flavor just just just perfectly. I became a huge fan to this instantly when I had my first mouth! The sandwiches were good. Esp the fairfax sandwich, the scrambled egg placed in the sandwich was very tasty and cooked perfectly ! Not an easy skill tho ;)  But The menu is limited , which is sometimes good though, cuz you don't want to think too much when your hungry !  Next time I come to vegas, first thing I'm going to do is grab the SLUT from here and then think what to do next ! A perfect place for breakfast or for a grab and go !",

Being an egg fanatic plays a role but something about that sausage, egg and cheese combination with a warm toasted bun - sigh. It just warms my heart thinking about it. Delicious. I've tried the Fairfax, egg salad sandwich, etc. The slut may be an acquired taste at first but just make sure it's mixed completely! Definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed.   So conveniently located as well since we always stay at the Cosmo.  Forget the LA location (which sucks), forget the Vegas buffets, I'm staying loyal to this Eggslut right here.",

This was a welcome breakfast stop after wasting time with Earl of Sandwiches manufactured egg sandwich. (They were cheaper but the eggs were factory formed scrambled patties...)

Someone ordered a sandwich with scrambled eggs. Big mistake. Let them prepare the sandwich how they intended.  The only reason for the 1 star deduct is the price. As others have mentioned, it's a rather pricey option, especially for breakfast counter orders.

I also ordered \"fresh orange juice\" after asking specifically if it was \"fresh SQUEEZED\". The girl who took my order assured me it WAS fresh squeezed, but at another location. After my first drink, I wondered if the location was the Tropicana plant. DEFINITELY NOT fresh squeezed orange juice. YUCK. The eggs on the sandwich were not cooked thoroughly, so I threw most of it away with the orange juice. I am generous in giving them three stars and did so because I like the general concept of the restaurant and the seating (which looked like broken eggs on pedestals) was super cute.

We would have gone elsewhere as we were anxious to hit the road. Our backups were perfectly fine but not worth an additional 25 minute wait after ordering. Despite the wait the food is mostly right. Brioche is spectacular, eggs a bit inconsistent (mine too hard, his just right) bacon nice and thiiiick, and fresh OJ paired with their arugula salad for under $40 seems like a steal for the Strip.....if you can handle the wait. Sunday is Sunday but they can use an extra hand cleaning up their seating areas and counter.  Filthy AF.",

The slut is mashed potatoes with a coddled egg in a jar served with toasted pieces of baguette. It was ok, the salt on top of the egg made it a bit too salty. And I honestly would have preferred some fries potatoes instead of the mashed potatoes. The Fairfax had both chives and onions which gave it too much oniony flavor. It was just so - so, and each item was roughly $10 so rather overpriced. Next time I'll go to the McDonald's down the street.",

The slut is fine but I wouldn't get it again. It was well executed - runny egg, smooth potato puree - but the flavors are overall very mild. I'd hoped for a more flavorful yolk-y taste, as one gets from farm fresh eggs. So, it's fine, glad I tried it but not again. And very glad I didn't wait in a long line to try it.",

The only recommendation I can make is getting an extra egg on your Sammie because I felt the ratio of bun to egg leaned a little to the buns. If I lived close enough, I'd be a regular Egg Slut.",

The gaucho-holy hell. This is what dreams are made of. With my addiction to steak and chimichurri there's no wonder I loved this sandwich. so balanced and delicious   Arugula salad-simple arugula with Parmesan cheese. Can someone please tell me what this dressing is? It's addicting! Also a great addition when you're hungover and need something fresh in your life   Sample the Fairfax and it was standard, nothing too crazy but I would just stick to the slut and gaucho and be content",

Took one bite and asked my friend if my egg was supposed to be cooked well done. He said the yolk was supposed to be runny, which it definitely was not. The bread they use is also not ideal, wasn't amazing or anything. The chef made me a new sandwich, which tasted slightly better now that the yolk was runny, but overall, still did not get WOWed by this place. Would not come back. So many other delectable spots in vegas for breakfast food!",

The chocolate cookie was awesome; if not for that, they would be getting 2 stars. Unless you have a food allergy (my friend with a soy allergy was very appreciative of their ingredients) or want to wait in line for a really good cookie, enjoy some other breakfast option.",

The lines were long when we visited at 11am in the morning, wrapping around the counter where customers order.   The sandwiches were pretty expensive, with additional costs for customization. I tried the Slut and the Bacon Egg and Cheese.  The food came out pretty slowly. Overall, it took around 30-45 minutes to order and get my food - definitely not a fast endeavor. Additionally, they don't have cups for water; only expensive bottles. There is only one bar table with like 10 seats.   The sandwich was honestly pretty good, but not amazing. The Slut was mediocre and bland.  I won't be coming back.",

A+ for food, B+ for pricing (still don't believe that the average sandwich is worth 10 dollars).",

They moved so fast and ran a very smooth operation. The line was about 60 deep but only took about 20 minutes to get through.   Verdict: I'd come back if There weren't so many other options.

I have to be honest, I don't really see what all the hype was about. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it's nothing to write home about.

Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering. I got the cheeseburger and don't regret it one bit! There's something amazing about adding egg to your meal - especially in a burger.

We were waiting less than 10 minutes before we reached the counter and about 5 minutes to get our food.   The menu is a decent size but the drinks are limited and pricey. $5 for a bottle of water...but hey, it's Vegas. You're supposed to throw away your money. I had the sausage, egg and cheese and it's amazing! It is greasy but that perfect if you have a hangover! They have chairs and tables to sit at (not many) and the soundtrack is very upbeat.

I recommend the Sausage (or Bacon), Egg & Cheese Sandwich and the Slut (a coddled egg on top of a potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives with a side of baguette slices)! The Slut was good (sometimes they run out - so get there early), but the yoke part of the egg was a little salty for me. Big sandwiches, good portions. Other than the long line as a downside, they don't have very much counter seating in the restaurant.",

    "text": "First Eggslut experience. I've heard good things about the California locations and was happy to see they opened one here at the Cosmo. I've heard about the insane lines this place could have, so I decided to hit it up at 3pm with some friends.   I really wanted to get the gaucho but I was worried the steak might be a little tough to eat one handed. (I was holding my 10 month old son in my other hand because they don't have high chairs and I didn't expect them to). I ended up ordering the cheeseburger. The bun was the star - it had this beautiful glow and hint of slight sweetness to it. The pickles and caramelized onions were a nice touch, but the patty was really lacking in size. We're talking McDonald's size cut here.  The slut - very creative and festive in its own little jar. It was perfectly seasoned and served at the right temperature. I wish there would have been just a little more bread. 3 little slices was not enough to compliment the slut.   Overall experience - I wouldn't get the burger again. It was kinda steep at $10 for a McDonald's sized patty and no extras or sides. The slut was also $10, also a little steep but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  Would I go again? Sure, I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and will try something different next time.   By the way, they don't serve ice/tap water. You have to buy their overpriced smart water if you want an H2O fix.",

Came here around 6am on a Sunday AM with one of my buddies. Menu is pretty simple.   Perfect type of food for a hangover or to satisfy those late night/early morning munchies that is a pretty much a staple when in Vegas. There was a bit of a line even at that hour of the day. Ordered the Sausage egg and cheese sandwich. Service is relatively quick. That breakfast sandwich totally hits the spot. Earl of Sandwich is usually my go to for early AM munchies. Now Eggslut can be added to the list of favorites to hit up when you've been up all night!",

Wham bam thank you ma'am. Eggslut, you are a genius, both in simple execution and location. They are conveniently located across from Marquee, so great for carbing up before turning up!  Fairfax sandwich: Soft scrambled eggs with chives, caramelized onions, cheese and sriracha mayo in a warm buttery brioche bun. I added avocado to this deliciousness and was glad I did. This was such a simple yet tasty breakfast sandwich. So good, I got it two days in a row. For $10 a pop, its a little on the pricey side, but hey that's Vegas for ya. Ball out for this egg sandwich... you won't regret it.   The line can be quite long during prime breakfast/brunch hours, but it moves quickly and service is fast here. Def worth checking out if you're staying at the Cosmo!",

This location is very busy but the line moves very fast.   I tried the Fairfax Sandwich. It's a locally made brioche bun that's stuffed with loose scrambled eggs, caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese and sriracha mayo. It's a very SQUISHY SOFT sandwich....it's super squishy with tons of squishy loose egg. I would never order it again but I know it's just me...I didn't think the brioche was the best because it was white inside.....brioche is a rich eggy buttery bread. I also thought the cheddar used wasn't the best. Really the only flavor it had was from the sriracha mayo....  My husband tried the Bacon and Cheese. His sandwich was made with lots of crisp bacon, the cheddar slice, an over medium egg and chipotle ketchup. I asked him how his sandwich was and he said squishy. I said your sandwich isn't as squishy as mine.....Mine is super squishy.  Give them a chance if you favor squishy sandwiches.",

It's bar seating with an open kitchen so you're able to see what is being made and how. Make sure to keep your receipt for when they call your name!  The fairfax was pretty good but didn't have that siracha heat or flavor I was hoping for. Add bacon and avocado ! If they don't give you a fork, ask for one!  The slut - the specialty Slut. This was worth it. Three pieces of toast accompanied by a small glass, recyclable, mason jar with a perfectly cooked egg. Dip the toast in the egg, place the egg on the toast with the spoon or just eat the egg out of the jar either way 100% get the Slut!",

I couldn't taste or find any onion, and very small amount of sauce on it (like a spicy mayo). Portions are small but pretty adequate for the price in Vegas. The atmosphere here is fun! Big egg shaped chairs and fun yellow and white decor. Also the lights are giant egg beaters, very creative!  I would try eggslut again but I didn't love my first time here.",

It has arugula on it which I thought added a nice flavor. They have seating but it's not like a restaurant more like upscale fast food. Most of the items on the menu have eggs hence the name lol. They do offer burgers as well. The staff was polite and they got the line moving pretty fast so that's always a plus and the food comes up pretty fast as well.  It was something different and I'm always happy to try new things",

I've been dying to try \"The Slut\" which is a jar of gooey eggs on top of pureed potatoes, served with toast; the breakfast sandwiches all look and sound delicious and are served on brioche - my fave!  The line on a Sat at 8am was around the corner, surprising for Vegas standards. So I waited until 9am to see if it died down but the line got longer (to the bathroom), which you'd think would move quickly since it's a fast food type joint... but it does not.   I was advised not to order the breakfast sandwiches because the bread was stale, and it was overall mediocre and expensive. Instead, I ordered the Slut which was disappointingly mediocre. I had a bite and didn't finish. Also the bread was stale!  Pro-tip: They reopen at midnight, visit then - there are NO LINES at all!",

In the busy periods, expect to wait 45 mins to order.  In non-peak hours, the wait time is like 5 mins.  I ordered the Gaucho sandwich the first time and it was delicious!  The wagyu beef was so tasty and full of flavours. The beef literally melts in your mouth.  At $15, they are a bit pricier but worth every dollar in my opinion.  I ordered two Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwiches on two other occasions and they are a class of it's own compared to other breakfast sandwiches.  The eggs are definitely fresher, and have a taste that just cannot be compared.  I miss having to return home and not being able to get eggslut.",

Be prepared for a wait though. We came here around lunchtime on a Sunday and there was a long line. But the line moved fast and we ended up waiting about half an hour. They make the sandwiches pretty quickly, so once we ordered, it only took a couple minutes before we got our sandwiches. I definitely want to come back and try the slut next time.",

Right inside the Cosmopolitan by the beautiful chandelier.  Be prepared to stand in line, HOWEVER, the like moved very quickly! Especially for 8:45am on a Sunday.   Staff is SUPER friendly and loves to give you suggestions, we talked to a guy who loves  he Broncos as much as we do so that was fun!   The food... omg deliciousness and so fresh. I mean you literally watch them crack the eggs and take the bacon out and put it on the grill.  Gluten Free options available.  I had the bacon, egg & cheese and wanted seconds. I ate it slow so I could really enjoy it! People behind us had come 3 days in a row, that's just how good it is!   Fresh squeezed orange juice $5 Breakfast sandwiches are about $9  So worth the wait and the price!   Do yourself a favor & Eggslut it up",

Also, everything is expensive on the Vegas Strip so as one other Yelper commented, it's a better and tastier deal to eat here than at a typical sit-down spot.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and it was glorious.  The egg just exploded yolky goodness with the first bite (yeah, be careful, it can get messy).    The coffee was okay.  It's $5 and nothing spectacular.  I'd suggest making use of the free in-room coffee at your hotel if you have that.",

You take the toasted french bread swirl it up real good and eat it in all its gooey glory.   My seggcond favorite was the bacon egg and cheese on the softest brioche you ever did taste.

Let me tell you... it almost didn't happen because we were staying way down at The Delano and had no intention of eating or doing anything at The Cosmopolitan.  Luckily for me, I went there to do a little gambling and hanging out with my friend while the rest of our group was out at a club nearby. What's even better is that they OPENED AT 12AM. WHAT??? I thought maybe I was catching them at the end of their day and were getting ready to close. LITTLE DID I KNOW, BUT I CAUGHT THEM JUST AS THEY OPENED. I can't even tell you how happy I was. I marched myself right up to the counter and ordered my BEC sandwich and waited excitedly for what I was about to experience.  Honestly, this sandwich was SO GOOD. The eggs, bacon, cheese and chipotle ketchup were PERFECTION. I should've gotten another one just to relive it again. If I ever make it back to LA, I'm definitely hitting up the original location!",

    "text": "So I've heard so much about this place and never got to try it until now. I heard some mixed reviews about this place so I decided to check it out myself. The place is small, kind of like a to go place. You place your order and once your order is up, you pick up your food. There are some bar chairs that surrounds the place. And it has an open kitchen so you could see everything the chef does to your food!   I got the Fairfax sandwich. It was really good!! It came with scrambled eggs, chives, onions, cheese, and a sriracha mayo sauce. It tastes exactly like a breakfast sandwich. The first couple of bites were amazing...and then the taste got a little overwhelming. All in all, this sandwich was really good! Just can't have too much of it.   The total for that sandwich was around $8. So really not bad at all for a burger/sandwich. And their menu isn't big either, so it makes it easier to choose what you want. And I love their times! They're only closed a couple hours and they reopen again. So perfect for the nightlife in Vegas. But be warned...the line gets super long during 2am because its literally right next door to Marquee Nightclub",

I had the sausage,egg and cheese. Sounds simple enough right? However, the way they cooked the eggs paired with the honey mustard aioli sauce between the warm brioche buns makes all the difference. The orange juice was fresh and excellent as well. My taste buds have been all over the place since I've been watching my diet and making better food choices but I got to say this was an excellent sandwich that I ate without any guilt, because what happens in Vegas................",

Gaucho: get it!! It's pricey, but I love the flavors in there. Slut: if you like mashed potatoes and don't mind mushy baby food texture, get it!! It's like eating comfort food in a jar. Perfectly cooked toast to go with it.  OJ: save your $$$, not worth the $5 Overall, if I'm in Cosmo, I'd get eggslut again. Nothing I would go all the way to the strip for though  Next time I come back, I'd give the sandwich with the scrambled egg and caramelized onions a try.",

Mashed potatoes on the bottom were super creamy and well seasoned. The egg yolk was soft but not too runny. Also the presentation and portion size was spot on.   I can only complain about the seating. There wasn't much of it, and the table we sat at hadn't been cleaned. It had a a fast-casual feel to it, and for some reason I was expecting it to be a more sit down breakfast place.  Overall solid breakfaat",

They made good by offering to make me a new sandwich but why waste perfectly good food so I just had them put some bacon on a plate and I put it on the sandwich myself, they also threw in a chocolate and salted caramel cookie for my troubles which was nice and delish.",

    "text": "Eggslut. You had me at Eggslut.  When you're on The Strip and you just want a little egg in your life, grab your pearls and top hat and take a stroll on down to The Cosmopolitan--or as I call it, Dat Mopo.  The Eggslut is located on the second floor of Dat Mopo going on The Strip North if you're coming from The Shops at Crystals (fancy, you). It's right past the homeless man with the cardboard sign that reads \"Need cash to get drunk with loose women.\" This is an honest-to-god landmark, so look for it if you get lost.  The Eggslut is a busy little open kitchen with parallel counter seating across its high-end food court layout. We ordered three sandwiches, a cookie and a biscuit.   I had The Gaucho which is [regurgitated from menu]: seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. This was delicious, though my Asian-fusion inspired tongue demands all sandwich eggs to be runny as heck. Still, the egg was soft and moist and mixed in well with the red onions and sweet pillowy mouthfeel of the brioche bun.  I also got to try the house-made buttermilk biscuit which came with maple syrup and butter. We got our food take-away (as they say in London) and so maybe this would've been better hot and fresh but it was a little dry and there was nothing seemingly special about the butter and syrup. We also got THE COOKIE which is described as \"dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt, baked fresh every morning.\" I'm not an expert on salt. I know there is salt with an umbrella on the label, and Hawaiians have a salt, and I know \"sale\" is salt in Italian (thanks DuoLingo!). So, I don't know what is gray salt. Whatever gray salt is, IT MADE THIS COOKIE DAMN GOOOOOD. Gray Salt Cookies 4 Life.  Thanks Eggslut. Now I'm no longer only all about that bass, I'm all about that \"GRAY SALT COOKIES 4 LIFE\" Life.",

Not worth my money. Everything tasted alright just not my cup of tea.   However, my friends got the egg slut which looked like a little jar with egg and got bread to dip. Apparently thats the to-go. Everyone said it was amazing so if you're gonna try one thing I think this is the one you should go for. They also tried the sausage and egg one which they said was an upgraded egg and sausage mcmuffin. If you're an egg fan I'm sure you'd love it and just enjoy drowning in the running eggy-ness.",

The cage free egg was definitely cooked to perfection.  As for the tri-tip, I could hardly tell if it was wagyu or roast beef. At about $15 a sandwich I was quite disappointed. You might as well feed me an Arby's roast beef topped with a cage-free egg!!!!  As the customers started building up, I noticed many ordered the SLUT. I was told that this dish was good even it seemed weird to me. I personally don't like eating my yolk, unless it is combined with at least meat and rice (or bread in this case).

    "text": "THe Guacho and the Slut are our #1 favorites at Eggslut for sure.  There usually a wait here so be prepared to stand in line... like others have said, the line does have a tendancy to wrap all the way around the corner. I personally wake up pretty early so I usually beat the giant line which is the only reason we still continue to come! I would never wait over 20 minutes to get food here, some people wait an hour+ for an egg sandwich and that is just crazy to me.. it's good, but it's not THAT good.   Here's what to get:  - GAUCHO (seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun)  - FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun)  - SLUT (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)  - BUTTERMILK BISCUIT (house-made buttermilk biscuit served with butter & maple syrup)",

There is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier.  We got the infamous \"slut,\" Fairfax sandwich and some orange juice. The orange juice taste so good! So refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! The Slut is pretty good, its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip. The sandwiches are amazing and the Fairfax doesn't disappoint. I still think of the bread and how soft it is!   Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

The Fairfax was pretty good but didn't really think it was worth the time or money. Neither of us liked the slut. It was okay I guess but the mashed potatoes tasted instant and it was kind of bland. They do use fresh ingredients so that's a plus. There's always a line and the reviews look great so maybe my expectations were too high.",

    "text": "My bf and I tried Eggslut in LA and loved it. We're from San Francisco, so we don't have access to it often. When we found out one opened in Las Vegas, we knew we had to fulfill our craving!  It's in the Cosmopolitan hotel, which is right on the Strip and super convenient. We ate there on a Friday (veteran's day), arrived around 11am and waited only 30 mins - not bad at all. When you first arrive at Eggslut, the line looks short, like 4 people. However, once you turn the corner, you see this extremely long line that extends to the restrooms! It's quite intimidating, but it moves quickly. I think there were at least 50 people in front of us, and we only waited 30 mins. Really, not bad compared to LA!  Food highlights: -The Slut - their house specialty! This is a must. It's a coddled poached egg with smooth potato puree inside a glass jar, with salt and chives. They also have slices of baguette on the side to dip or spread.  -Sausage, Egg, & Cheese Sandwich. YUM. This is a breakfast sandwich composed of a house-made turkey sausage, over-easy egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a brioche bun. I loved the simple combo of the sausage with overeasy egg and cheese...kind of reminded me of a sophisticated McDonald's breakfast sandwich. Just simple, just wonderful. Can't go wrong with this one. The brioche bread was a little thick, but still good.  -Fairfax Sandwich (scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo inside brioche bun). You can add avocado and a turkey sausage for additional $2 each, which was definitely a game changer. The main difference between this one and the Sausage, Egg &Cheese sandwich above is the egg - would you rather have it scrambled, or over easy? Just based on your preference. This was another great sandwich, but I didn't care so much for the sriracha mayo. That's just me though.  Service: Food came out very quickly, maybe within 5-7 mins of ordering. It's just the line that took forever. They really should have opened a 2nd cashier, because I think the kitchen could have handled it.   Ambiance: You sit on these diner-style chairs, and bar seating. The seating is limited, but there's also a high turnaround of customers that just eat and go. Because of this though, all of the tables are dirty, and napkins not refilled, etc. I felt like they needed more help with cleaning.   Overall, definitely worth trying if you've never had it before!",

    "text": "I wanted to see for myself what the hype was about and with a name like \"EggSlut\" how can one not be intrigued. Who am I kidding I've been dying literally dying to try EggSlut since before I even knew we were getting one here in Vegas and somehow my dreams came True.   Conveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan, EggSlut has found it's home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there. Ok with much anticipations I came before a concert with a hunger and a mission. With the Slut in mind I didn't realized that they run out in the mornings with those. So we ordered the sausage, egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches. To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar.   The prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big. They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty, slightly buttery and very good. The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy. Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich. The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory. It was a tasty surprise.   All in all it was good, filling and you gotta love the branding. I will probably come back for the \"Slut\" which I didn't get to try but I don't know if I can pay the price on a daily. $30 something for 2 breakfast sandwiches and a ice coffee is pretty hefty for my budget. Regardless I'm a fan and I would definitely tell people that's it's worth it.",

The one I always hear about is the one in LA but I made enough time to go visit so when I heard about there being one in Las Vegas, I had to try it out!  The shop is on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, near where Milk is.  There isn't much seating, so you might have to stand and eat or sit somewhere nearby.   The most popular items are the Fairfax and the Slut. I decided to get the sausage egg and cheese one with added avocado because I didn't feel like getting scrambled eggs.  The brioche bun was arguably the best part of the sandwich. It was toasted or pan-fried and is slight crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The other best part was the sausage! It's a little different from the ones I have had at other breakfast places. It has plenty of flavor and grease (which is great for the morning after a night out!) I can't wait to go again and try out other items!",

Well, you definitely won't miss Eggslut on the 2nd floor across Marquee because of its 1. name and 2. the long, long line. The weekend I went and passed by, there was constantly a line that winds around the corner.   I honestly wasn't exactly impressed with the food. It was just average, and nothing memorable. It could be because I ordered the wrong thing. I ordered \"the slut\" which was disappointing... I should have ordered a sandwich.

We came by at around 2 pm and there was still a line so we walked around The Strip and by 3:30 pm there were only a few people in line so we got our food.   Service: There isn't really a \"service\" here, you order and pay, they make It and call your name out and you sit wherever you want.   Price: It is VERY pricy for the small portions. \"The Slut\" and Sausage, Egg, Bacon bun costed a little less than $20   Food:  Overall the food was really good but very pricy.   Notes:  There is a bar type seating that fits about 20 people at max.",

    "text": "We found out about Eggslut when we were at Grand Central Market when we first tried it. Ever since the Las Vegas location opened, it has become our tradition to eat Eggslut as a breakfast/brunch item of our weekend. Our favorite menu item has got to be the pictured Gaucho sandwich ($15). Although it's one of the most expensive items on the menu, it is worth it! The seared wagyu steak along with the over-medium egg and chimichurri sauce makes for a great sandwich combination in the morning. The brioche bun is definitely a nice touch, which makes this an even more awesome sandwich choice!   Recommendation: It's definitely worth it to at least try the \"Slut,\" which is one of their house specialties: cage-free coddled egg over potato puree inside a glass jar, which comes along with baguette bread on the side ($10.50). Although the name of the establishment and the menu items may be risque, that's the beauty of what makes you remember their sandwiches.",

I found myself in Vegas right in front of it at 1:00 AM in the morning. There was no line at this late hour so my hubby and I decided this was as good a time as any to get it. I got the egg, bacon and cheese egg sandwich, and I was disappointed. The biggest miss was that the bacon was over cooked to me. It was tough, dry and crunchy. The cheese was not exactly melty, and the egg itself would've been better runny. Overall, it felt like a dry sandwich. Maybe these are all personal preferences as to how I like my bacon and egg on a sandwich. Perhaps I would've been more impressed if I hadn't come across a YouTube video of how to recreate the egg slut egg sandwich at home which I attempted a few months ago. My faux egg slut sandwich was so good which was another reason that I really wanted to try the real thing. Now that I've tried it, I think I'll stick to my own.",

I made the trek from The Palazzo where I was staying to the Cosmopolitan one early morning. I figured I would skip the dark dingy gym and do a speed walk to Eggslut! I think I burned all the calories I ate too!  Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor. It's very close to the escalators so you won't miss it! It's more of a fast food type service where you stand in line (usually a long one) order and pay, then wait for your order to be called. I wasn't sure what to order so I went for the basic egg and bacon sandwich! Can't go wrong with bacon! I also got a cup of their iced cold brew! My order came up quickly maybe 10 minutes. My mouth was watering at first sight and my very first bite I was smitten! It was yummy! Some things I would have changed to make it more yummier would be to make the bread a bit crispier, the egg a bit more runny and use less ketchup. Maybe I can customize my sandwich on my next visit.  All in all I very much enjoyed my walk and breakfast sammie. I heard they have a location in Los Angeles as well and hopefully they will be making their way to San Diego!",

I was about to go stand back in line just to order another one but by the time I finished my sandwich the line was super long. I also got an orange juice and it was really good since its fresh squeezed.   The service was great. Every one was so friendly and nice.

My favourite by far is the Gaucho sandwich. I absolutely loved the slice of real, juicy steak bathed in heavenly chimchurri sauce, embraced by a golden brioche bun. The downside is that it costs twice as much as their basic sandwiches.  Number 2-4 would be Bacon, then Sausage, then Fairfax, in my opinion. To be honest, these guys tasted good, but kind of boring.  I almost wish Eggslut could open full service restaurants, and that their sandwiches would come with a side of home style fries...  Definitely worth a try at least!",

Go when there is no line, because you don't want to wait that long line and be disappointed! However, i was in the short line and disappointed in the bread quality! Maybe I'm not a fan of bread they have? But I'm pretty sure I've tried better breakfast sandwiches.   It's decent simple 'fast' breakfast, (if you don't consider the long line).  TIPS / SUGGESTIONS:  - go anytime after 3pm, when there is a shorter line  - good for after pool party snack (Marquee Pool is conveniently right there)  - try it to see the hype..

However, I don't think I'm going to be waiting in line again for another Eggslut. Not that it's not good, it's just not anything that I haven't had  or couldn't have in many of the great breakfast places.   My party tried the Eggslut, Gaucho and Fairfax. To me Gaucho was the best with quality and perfectly cooked steak,packed with good flavor from the chimichurri sauce. The Fairfax had the right running consistency in a soft scramble that I look for, but other than the chives all the other ingredients just disappeared into the background. Now the signature slut didn't live up to my perhaps overhyped expectations. Once you mix the egg in as they instruct you to do, the richness of the yolk is diluted to the point of being barely noticeable. A bit of a disappointment.  Check this one off my list. You won't find me online again.",

It was absolutely worth the wait.  I accidentally added a turkey sausage to the fairfax.  The first bite was a blend of creamy egg, Siracha creamy mayo,  warm bread, and a taste of sausage with a kick.  It's hard to explain how much better their sandwich is compared to others.  Having said that, yes it is basically $9-10 a sandwich or more.  I had the bacon egg cheese on a second visit and it too was delicious.  I preferred the fluffy egg on the fairfax but you can't go wrong eit",

You can spread it over the baguette (you can order more baguette) and it was gooey yumminess. Be prepared to wait in line as it is a popular place. OJ is a little on the pricey side for $5, but hey, it's Vegas. After you get your Slut, you can fight for a place to sit.",

Maybe not a big fan of brioche bread so that was my experience. If was on a better bread I prob would have really liked it. Ordered a biscuit... ugh it was served cold and was very heavy dense.

It was considered a specialty and something I haven't tried from them. However, I thought the egg part was way too salty. Also, they only give you like 4 slices of baguette which was not enough to finish the egg.   It was very crowded when we went too air not worth the wait in my opinion.",

Get extra toast. Grab a sandwich as well, I like the Fairfax with bacon. Then find a seat and wait, impatiently wait. Your stomach grumbles, you get jealous as others get theirs, and it takes a short minute because it's made to order. They call your name get back to your seat..dig in...dip your toast, spread the poached egg and mashers all over it like butter. Dip some more..dip again.. breathe..you've now been changed forever. Soak it all in..because whatever you were before, you are an eggslut now... Strong four..almost a five...fricking on the level. Nuff said..",

So we ordered SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE and EGG SALAD sandwiches with average quality expensive coffee . Yes , they beverages were over prices for the quality . The sandwiches were unique because of warm brioche bun , otherwise the sausage and egg were just like any above average breakfast brunch place . Egg salad was flavorful with honey mustard and dressed arugula .  Definitely a place to try when you visit cosmopolitan in Vegas .",

I was extremely underwhelmed by Eggslut. The food isn't horrible, but it's not worth a 25-30 minute wait in line.   I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. The presentation was lovely but for whatever reason, it was messing AF. The sauce kept oozing out and eventually messed up my clothes. The taste was rather bland and left a lot to be desired. Like how does Applewood bacon not taste good? Maybe my expectations were too high. I really don't know.   Honestly, if you're dead ass hungry and need some food asap. You will be fine. You know what? The meal reminds me of those Jimmy Dean frozen sandwiches. It gets the job done, but you wished you had something else.  Anyway, be persuaded by your own mind and try it for yourself.",

    "text": "After an intense clubbing night at Marquee, my friends and I decided to grab a quick late night snack before heading back to our hotel. Even though I live in LA, I actually never had the opportunity to visit Eggslut and try its menu. Pretty buzzed, I ordered the Slut, which is essentially coddled egg and potato puree in a mason jar with a couple slices of toasted baguette drizzled in olive oil on the side. The aftermath of mixing the egg and potato puree together is a rich and thick mixture that is super flavorful. It acts as a spread you put on top of the crunchy baguette. I'm someone who never really eats midnight snacks, so for me to finish an entire order by myself... I'd say the Slut is pretty damn good!",

Their signature dish \"The slut\" is more a novelty in presentation to me. Basically tasted like glorified mashed potatoes.  The bacon, egg, and cheese is exactly as stated and nothing amazing to write about.  Same is said for the pre-made biscuits they warm up under the broiler. For me,so far, the Fairfax sandwich is the star. I found it to be a nice blend of flavors,which I have no problems ordering each time I go. Wait is hit or miss, I've been here when there is no wait and other times it is a far stretched line. However the line does tend to move pretty quickly. Seating it limited, which is unfortunate since the egg sandwiches can get kinda messy and a table top would be nice.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area I'm up for it.",

This is not a gourmet place but just a drop by get some delicious egg sandwiches and be on your way type (Just made that up).   This place has few entrees but all of them are on point. Your order takes about 5 minutes and you get to experience a runny egg with bacon. Best thing about this is the price. In comparison to other places in Vegas, this is very affordable. Granted they don't serve as much food as a buffet but that's also a positive in my mind because you won't overeat. I woudl recommend this place for a drop in breakfast/lunch snack or mini meal",

We went on a Thursday around one pm and walked right up and ordered with no line.  My husband ordered the egg salad sandwich, which was just an ordinary sandwich with no accompaniment and left him still hungry.  I ordered the cheeseburger which came with a medium fried egg and carmelized onions on very fresh bun and far exceeded my expectations.  Truly delicious.  I encouraged my husband to taste mine and he ordered one as well. Food was delicious!  Simple menu and for the remainder of our trip this place continually had a huge line.  Worth the wait!",

But I would eat it standing up if I had to.            Definitely make sure you buy an egg slut and it's one of the best things I've ever had.

Especially if you look at the photos on the Egg Slut website where the ooey gooey cheese is all melty goodness.  We knew it was going to be good as soon as we saw the line!  We waited about 35 minutes in line and another 15 for our food.  I noticed they prepare the food in an assembly line fashion, so one guy is cooking all the eggs and putting them in a pan, where they sit until the next guy is ready, and so on.  Had our food been hot the cheese, the sriracha mayo, and the egg would have all melded together to form the perfect bite.  That being said, it was nearly perfect even cold.   I had the bacon and egg and cheese sandwich and my husband had the Fairfax.  We shared a biscuit which comes with butter and maple syrup.  Yummy!  Also, I know it's Vegas - but $5 for a bottled Smart water was ridiculous!",

The cheese is melted before they add it to ur sandwich. So it gives the illusion of being hot(but it's not), as for the bacon it wasn't cooked all the way through. As U take a bite most of the bacon is pulled out(because it's not cooked). That turned me off I don't like my bacon alive. The fried egg was good & their bread had good texture.

I'm still not sure what the appeal is at this place, but hey, who am I to judge. That being said, this particular location yields some pretty friendly service and very consistent food. The egg sandwiches here are as expected, a bit on the small side and a bit on the expensive side just like the rest of this place. But I will tell you that after a long night out, Eggslut sounds pretty freaking delicious and the location is near perfect. Overall, good in a pinch, but if you want something more than just hangover food, this may not be the place.

My friend and I both had the Slut.   The cage free coddled egg on top a bed of pureed potatoes with chives and grey salt on top. It was served in a small glass jar ( it looks bigger in photos) placed in a recyclable container with 3 pieces of toasted baguette I think 4 or 5 pieces would be better but we gotta watch the carbs right?   It was definitely pricey for breakfast.. I think $11 you only get one egg on top of the mashed potatoes. It was pretty decadent because of the yolk from the egg mixing into the warm buttery mash. Once I got to the bottom of the jar I was contemplating if it was box/instant mash potatoes because it sure did taste like some hungry jack. The breakfast sandwiches looked good from what I saw others order.",

He ordered two items to go & brought it back to our hotel room -- the slut and a bacon egg & cheese sandwich. The sandwich was whatever -- it tasted like what you would imagine it to taste like. The slut on the other hand was heavenly. It was a coddled egg in a little glass jar with mashed potatoes on the bottom. They served it with a couple pieces of bread and some hot sauce. It was really good and I even kept the jar to bring home so that I could try making it myself at home as well. Overall, I would definitely go back just for the slut but I would probably skip out on the sandwich.",

It was my first time trying this place out. There are no Eggslut's out in the East Coast, so I definitely had to give it a try while I was in Vegas.

Finally one morning as we were looking for places to get breakfast we decided to try Eggslut.  I wish we tried Eggslut sooner.  We were in Vegas for 4 days and we tried Eggslut on day 3.  I had the gaucho sandwich and he had the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich.  I love me some runny egg.  This gaucho was perfection.  It was so delicious - I would eat this everyday if I could.  I could not stop thinking about Eggslut.  My husband ended up going back that evening to get me the slut and bringing it back to our room.  I am drooling thinking about the slut.  Buttery goodness with the runny egg on top.  I enjoyed every single bite of the slut as we were watching the Bellagio fountains from our terrace.  It was perfect in every way.  I cannot wait to go back to Vegas to have me some more Eggslut!",

If you want coffee or water you'll be out five bucks. Go down the hall to the juice bar and get their \"Living water\" for $1.50.   The communal tables are kinda gross too because there is such a high turnover of customers that they never seem to get cleaned from customer to customer. You can see the greasy fingerprints all over!  Like I said, the food was good but I don't think I'll be back.",

I'm sure they have some artisanal blah blah story about their coffee, but it tastes like something you pick up at a gas station.

Food was prepared rather quickly and neatly. I think price wise everything was reasonable except for the OJ.

After I ordered a bacon sandwich and turkey sausage sandwich, it totalled up to almost $19, once I went to the pick up counter I waited 10 min while people received thier order before me that were behind me in line. The lady said I dont know what happened, I received no apology!!!! I finally get the sandwiches, and it tastes like a upgraded McDonald's sandwich, I definitely can make a better one. Was it edible? Yes, its only worth $5, with a ten min wait. Do yourself a favor somewhere else like the pizza place on 3rd floor.",

    "text": "If you were wandering hungrily around the Cosmopolitan Casino and saw a winding line leading to a place called \"Eggslut,\" you would hop on it, right? Right. And you wouldn't regret waiting in said line for half an hour and then for your food another 15 minutes because it will transport you to breakfast heaven. This place still feels like a food truck operation but the food is honest and the combo of flavors delicious. And reasonable! Where else are you going to get a very decent breakfast for $8 on the strip? We both got the Fairfax, which is \"cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun\" plus fairy dust I guess because it's amazing. The fresh squeezed orange juice is great as well. And they open AT midnight on Saturday and Sunday just in case you were doing something late in a casino on the weekends.",

It's really good and the brioche bun is so soft and fluffy. You can really taste the caramelized onions. I'd give them 5 stars but the sandwiches felt really light on the eggs. Ironic cause they're called Eggslut. Next time I would ask if they could add an extra egg to the scramble, so that it's more hearty and so you can really taste some eggs.",

    "text": "I love this place. Seriously, where can I get one in the Bay Area?   First thing to know about Eggslut is that you need to time your visit. If you try to visit during the breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait 30 minutes or possibly even more for the line and your food. Try to come past the lunch hours (approximately after 1pm) if you're impatient like me.  As for the food itself, I got the Slut which is a potato mash beneath a poached egg and it comes with pieces of bread to scoop up the mash and egg. It's by far my favorite way to eat poached egg now. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The only small complaint is that it's not an very filling meal if you're starving. I definitely wasn't hungry after I ate it but I wasn't really full either.  I had a bite of my friends burger and it was quite tasty as well and apparently more filling so that's probably the way to go if you're looking to cure your hangover.",

Took about a 20 minute wait in total (making the line to being served and getting a seat). I had the sausage egg and cheese and my lady had the Fairfax. Both breakfast sandwiches blew us away. Both cooked to perfection. The buns were soft and fresh and the eggs had just enough season to give it nice little pop. I will continue to go back any location i come across.",

    "text": "Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan and it is great for any breakfast lovers. They really do the cage-free eggs justice here. I hear that there is often a line, but I think it's worth it. Eggslut is definitely one of the top choices if you are looking for a delicious quick bite, without eating a heavy meal. I can see it being a convenient option before heading to Marquee Dayclub or Nightclub.   My 2 Favorites here are the Fairfax Sandwich ($8.50) and the Slut ($10.00). If you are with a friend, I would even recommend that you each got your own Fairfax and then share a Slut ;)   The Fairfax Sandwich is a delicious savory breakfast sandwich with soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and sriracha mayo on a sweet warm toasted brioche bun. You can upgrade with bacon, turkey sausage or avocado if you wish, but I enjoy the Fairfax as in. The savory eggs and caramelized onions really go well with the sweetness of the brioche bread. Great for any meal!! Breakfast, lunch or dinner. I can eat this stuff all day.   The Slut is their specialty. This glorious creation has a potato puree base topped with a coddled egg and slow cooked in a glass jar. Then it is topped with salt and chives. It is served with slices of thin baguettes and the workers will instruct you to mix up with ingredients in the jar very well before you proceed. Personally I like to take a few pictures before I proceed to the mixing and eating.   Eggslut is a great squeeze in between all of your Vegas festivities.",

The egg was better on the fairfax for sure, but even so we did not think either sandwiches were worth the wait. It didn't taste especially great, but it did fill us up.",

I waited about 20 min to order and then about another 10-15 min for my actual food.   Ordered the turkey sausage sandwich with the sauce on the side so I could heat it up later. The sandwich next day was actually pretty good so I can imagine eating it fresh would be a lot better.   I'm not sure I would wait that long again unless I was with other people and ordering a lot more then just one sandwich.",

The formula is simple and they do a dang good job at it. The location is down on the strip, so if you're staying in the area and want something to soak up your hangover or you just want a dang good breakfast Sammy, this is the place to go.   The casino offers 1 hour of free parking, which is plenty of time to get in line, wait, get your order to go and bounce. You'll be pushing it to sit down and eat. Just 1 minute over that hour will cost you another $10, which makes that a pretty expensive Sammy.   So, if you're driving over and don't want to cough up the cash, then get in and get out and you'll thank me later.",

The egg and bacon were cold because they are cooked by various people and put on trays. The cheese of course was not melted. McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks have nothing to worry about. Also no bacon flavor and too much fat. The assembly line doesn't put out a quality product. They are lucky most people are here for a couple of days and then gone and they don't take the time to write a review. You can thank me. My grand total was $18.67 because I got oj and a cookie.

It's convenient, it's delicious, and it's conveniently located outside a club - what's not to love?",

Even when it wrapped around the corner and down the hall, it took us about 30 minutes total from getting in line to receiving our food -- it moves fairly quickly.  There's a reason why it's so popular, and it's because they do their dishes really, really well.  I ordered the Fairfax, which is essentially a scramble egg sandwich, and the eggs were so creamy and rich.  The portion sizes aren't that large, but because it was so rich and decadent, it was definitely filling.  I came around 9:30 am on a Sunday, and the biscuits were sold out at the time, although they must make them continually throughout the day because a friend went later and got one.  I had a bite of it and personally I'm not sure if the single biscuit is worth $4 alone, but it definitely was delicious.  Don't expect a quick in and out breakfast because there's usually always a line during the morning hours.  There's a plenty of available seating in the area and people are pretty good about eating and leaving to clear space for others.  Definitely worth the wait for a hearty breakfast, if you're in the area!",

Got the Fairfax with bacon while my brother tried the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, both of which were great! As someone who's obsessed with soft-scrambled eggs, the Fairfax was amazing, with the creamy melted cheese and sriracha mayo all soaking into the warm brioche bun.

I tried the \"Slut\" under their specialties menu once and I haven't been able to convince myself to try anything else! The poached egg was perfectly cooked, which sat on top of potato puree in a glass jar. Topped that with salt and chives, and there's the perfect combo! It also came with a couple slices of baguette, which were just a little on the tough side. I love the poached egg with the potato puree so I will leave it alone but maybe I will try to put the potato puree on next time!  If you like poached egg, then the Slut is a must! Will definitely go back when I am close to one of their stores again in LA and Las Vegas!",

I wouldn't recommend it for people who are actually hungry. $8.00 for a sandwich seems like you're getting a deal in Vegas but you're not. You will be in search of more food after. Also buy a drink elsewhere. No need to spend $5 for one drink.",

But for ours she just gave us the actual sandwiches individually packed in handle-less paper bags (like old school paper lunch bags) which she folded over and was awkward to carry out.",

However even though the sausage patties was terribly dry I didn't hate it overall and I will go back to try something different!  oh and they offer no other condiments to sauce it up other than the ones that come on the sandwiches which are a chipotle ketchup and honey mustard and a sort of mayo with a kick . They sell Mamosa's that come in a can which I thought was pretty cool  I had a pineapple and mango flavored they were both pretty good!!!",

Okay, it didn't happen quite like that but I imagine that's how Chris Tucker felt when he was at the massage parlor in Rush Hour 2.  Ever since I saw my California friends posting about Eggslut, I've been wanting to give them a try. Now that they found a home at The Cosmopolitan, I figured why the heck not!   After a 25ish minute wait, which goes by fast when you have great company, I got The Slut and The Gaucho Sandwich. The Slut was super buttery and creamy! Just mix your potato puree and coddled eggs together and slap it onto a slice of baguette. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The  baguette gives it a crunchy element it really needs. I wish they gave one more slice of baguette though because I was left with some potato and eggs mixture that I ate by itself. It was reminiscent of buttery baby food. As for The Gaucho, oh my. The wagyu tri-tip was juicy, the egg was cooked perfect, I love the arugula, and the chimichurri was also flavorful. All this was washed down with an overpriced orange juice and a tiny overpriced coffee. I was energized for the rest of the day though. Coffee + food = Instant humanized Joyce W.   All in all, I really enjoyed my lunch at Eggslut and wouldn't mind stopping by again. Good on Cosmo for bringing in more great eateries!   Dat price doe: $37.85 for the Gaucho Sandwich ($15), cold brew ($5), The Slut ($10), and OJ ($5). At least you can use your food money to earn Identity Points.",

We were not let down, the food was fantastic and I would have ordered more had it not meant waiting in the super long line anymore. The line does move fast so it was not too bad. The portions are not large so if you are hungry, or recovering, order more than you would think. You order at the counter and either take the food somewhere else or if you are lucky, you find a seat nearby. No more need to explain, you just have to try it.",

Slut is a coddled egg on top of potato pure, garnished with chives and sea salt. The cheeseburger was grass fed beef topped with a fried egg on a brioche. Both items were divine. The Slut comes in this tiny mason jar and I was instructed to mix it immediately so the egg can cook a bit more. Top the mixture on toasted slices of baguette and it's heaven! The cheeseburger was fantastic except it had slices of sweet pickles which we're not fans of, but still dee-lish!   We'll gladly return either here or LA location!",

I got in line this morning all the way back at the bathroom with people standing two and three wide and still had food in my mouth within 25 minutes. That's about the same as any other breakfast restaurant in town, except maybe a buffet that'd cost you three times as much for food half as good (at best).  My favorite is the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The chipotle ketchup will blow your mind. Hovering somewhere between a salsa and a BBQ sauce, it's unique and tasty.  My wife likes the sausage, but it's a bit bland for my tastes. Their namesake dish, the slut, is mashed potatoes and a soft egg in a small glass jar with chives on top, served with toasted baguette slices. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned, but a bit small for the price IMO. If you've got a hangover, it'll help a lot though.",

    "text": "If you want the perfect complement to a Vegas vacation full of debauchery and spending, look no further. If you're a local with no other reason to be on the Strip, then keep looking.  Eggslut is an LA import that's set up shop in a very prominent second-floor corner space just off the East elevators of the Cosmopolitan. It's quite easy for locals to access from the underground parking structure (which is set up with red and green lights to indicate occupied and free parking spaces, respectively).  I'm not sure whether it was the conference being held upstairs or just the usual busy traffic, but I spent 40 minutes waiting in line starting at just before 10am on a Thursday. The food came out fairly quickly after that, and seats were somehow available at the long communal high top (in retrospect, I can see why).  Gaucho ($15): seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, seasoned arugula, egg over medium, warm brioche bun. Steak was tender, marbled, and pink. Arugula was the most distinctive of the veggies. Brioche was a bit insubstantial, but I enjoyed every bite of the rather small sandwich.  Slut ($10): coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. Gotta mix thoroughly with the provided spoon for full effect. It's a silky mixture that is seasoned just right, but perhaps reads a little more of the potato than egg. Also, a fourth slice of crunchy bread would've been right for this portion because I couldn't see how we would've heaped all of the jar's contents onto the crostini that we had.  Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($4.50): house-made dark chocolate chip cookie, topped with gray salt. This is on the large side of cookies but is still a pretty outrageous price, especially considering that it's just good. There's plenty of chocolate, but I don't get the same flavor in the dough as other great cookies and it's annoying to have to spread the salt around to get it in every bite.  I was happy in the moment with the flavors of the food, but it left me feeling regretfully unsatisfied when I got hungry again at lunch time (having split both entrees evenly with my friend). In a way, that makes a Eggslut a perfect symbol of Vegas.",

Would be a great place to eat if not for the long line. The wait time is always long, and not because the food takes a while to prepare. It's only because they have one single register open to take everyone's order. Ultimately I don't feel like waiting 30 minutes for an egg and bacon sandwich is worth the time, but if you can catch it with a short line then it's a solid choice.",

    "text": "Talk about yolk porn!!  Eggslut surpassed all my foodie dreams! This place is super hyped, with a line out the door (and around the corner), thanks to a heavy social media reputation.  But they definitely lived up to expectation.  Gooey golden yolks of dripping perfection! Located in the Cosmopolitan, this modern and edgy breakfast counter totally fits right in.  When we arrived just before 10am, the line was crazy long and almost deterring.  But slightly hung over and craving that glorious yellow, we decided to tough it out.  The line moves fast, so by 10:30am we were placing our orders at the register. Here's the scoop-- *The Slut ($10) A quick impulse add-on to our order, but probably the highlight of my meal.  Soft cooked egg over hot and smooth potato puree, garnished with salt and chives and served with baguette slices.  DELICIOUS. *Fairfax ($8) +Sausage ($3) Soft-Scrambled eggs done perfectly!  Not overcooked or dry like regular scrambled eggs can get. Sirracha Mayo added a nice kick.  And the Brioche bun was soft and buttery.  The sausage add on is a must, as I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much without the added salt/protein element. *Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich ($8.50) This was my husband's order.  He said this was good, but he has had better-- just your basic breakfast sandwich.  He also mentioned that it would have been better on sourdough, and although I am a big Brioche fan, I actually agree.  The sour tang would have paired great with the creamy egg yolk.  But then again, were from San Francisco, home of the famous Sourdough. :) *House Made Buttermilk Biscuit ($5) This was served with butter and syrup, but would have been better warmed up.  The piece I had was slightly dry and crunchy.  At $5, I would have skipped this one. I should also mention that I purchased a coffee for $5, which was the size of a Starbuck Tall, and nothing but simple brewed coffee.  Definitely overpriced. Everything we had at Eggslut was great!  If you ask my husband, it was okay.  But still worth it for the IG pics. :) If nothing else, definitely get The Slut!  Pictures and descriptions do not do it justice! We will be back again, Eggslut!",

    "text": "After reading reviews online, I knew I had to try this place. That, coupled with the fact that I was staying in the Cosmopolitan and I was super hungry for breakfast, meant that it was a must-try. I arrived about 30 minutes after they opened on a Monday morning to find the line around the corner and past the bathrooms. Thankfully, I was fully prepared to wait in line. What I wasn't prepared for when I got to the counter was that they were out of the turkey sandwich. You would have thought that they would post that on the menu for people to see while they wait in line and try to figure out what they want. But no, I waited in line for 30 minutes just to find out that the one sandwich I really wanted wasn't available. 30 minutes after opening!!  With my options limited, I opted for the next best thing. The regular sandwich with bacon. After placing my oreder, i waited about 10 minutes before hearing my name called.   40 minutes later and I'm ready to chow down. Armed with a fork and some hanger, I sat down at a lounge nearby to eat my food since all the tables and chairs were taken. After eating my sandwich, I didn't feel like it was worth the wait. Was the bread satisfying? Yes. Nice and soft with a little crunch. It stood up to the rest of the sandwich well. Was the egg cooked well? It was. Was the bacon tasty? Yup, not really enough of it.  All in all, I probably would have been disappointed if I traveled to the Cosmopolitan just for this. But since it was downstairs and around the corner, I'm ok with it. Will I be back? If I wanted a quick option for breakfast while staying in the Cosmo, yes. But for anything else? Probably not.",

Though the onions were actually really good, the eggs were under seasoned and didn't actually stay inside the bread, so I ended up eating mostly bread for a while (plain tasting) and then mostly egg for a while (also plain tasting).  The wait is super long, we waited for almost an hour; the pricing is crazy expensive for what you get (I almost got the Eggslut but realized it was TINY); and the eggs are plain. It was pretty cool to watch them make the food, though. It was fine to go to once to understand the hype, but I wouldn't say it's worth it to go again.",

Now that it's in the mecca collection that is Vegas, all the better! I personally love eggs...throw me an egg with any meal and I'll be perfectly satisfied, even if there's only rice as the other side. This was the first stop we made in Vegas when we got off the plane at 8:30, since I wanted me some breakfast!  You can't miss it; it's by the chandelier across from Marquee, but do check the hours as they are breakfast and early AM hours  mostly. I had to try the famous Slut. Yes, a little pricey at $10, but I had to do it. Reading the description didn't sound that appetizing...eggs on mashed potatoes? Well...I guess it could be like eggs and rice? It just sounded very mushy. But...give it a shot! Mix your coddled egg into the mashed potatoes with the chives and \"gray salt\" (that I couldn't really see) and let the warm yolky egg + mashed potatoes just melt your tastebuds. Comfort food at its best!  I want to come back and try a breakfast sandwich next time. Watching them grill that bacon is so tantalizing and smells heavenly!   Word of advice; bar seating is kind of limited by their area so if you have a few people, make someone claim a seat first :) Or else you might have to spread out over the lounge chairs near the chandelier!",

I know you've had a long night out and you probably got minimal to no sleep, but you don't need to take it out on the staff. They're just here to serve you delicious eggs to help relieve that hangover you're probably carrying with ya.  Jaime and I were excited to hear that this popular LA eatery was now a new dining spot in our hotel. I've always wanted to try the one in DTLA, but I could never bring myself to wait in line, especially when it's warm. The lines here are long as well, but at least you're in a climate controlled, air conditioned environment - so it's not terrible.  We got into line around 930AM and it was already wrapped down the hallway. After checking out the menu, we decided on a breakfast sandwich with sausage and one with bacon. Everything moved super quick, and then you're there to wait. Get comfy, cause it can be a while and this is where I saw the most of the crankiness ensue. Since everything is made to order, food comes out on the slower side. They have a ton of people working in the kitchen, but most of the time, customers are ordering multiple items at the same time causing a little bit of a speed bump. The guy handing out orders was a champ though, even when people were shoving receipts in his face demanding their food. Keep up the good fight!  It was probably about 20-mins before we got our stuff, but we enjoyed doing some people watching while we waited. There are all types that come through here... it's fun trying to figure out where they were or where they're going.  For food, we both really enjoyed our sandwiches. They were served on fluffy brioche buns and had a good amount of eggs, meat and condiments to make it a great handheld. Consuming one was good, especially since wanted to eat again in a few hours. Make sure to grab napkins, cause they do get messy.  I'd for sure come back. The prices weren't super steep and I thought they were pretty tasty. If you want to cut down on the lines, I'd go around 1-2pm as it seemed much slower when we walked by.",

The line was wrapped around the corner, but moved quickly. It took about 20 mins to get to the counter.  My husband ordered the sandwich with turkey sausage. It was NASTY. The sausage tasted like particle board. It was thin and didn't taste  meat.  I ordered the bacon breakfast sandwich. The bacon was crispy, but is was dripping grease.   There are plenty of places in Vegas to eat...I would recommend anywhere but here.",

    "text": "Came to Eggslut on a Saturday morning ready for a hangover cure, and was not disappointed!  There was a small line, probably 20 people in front of us, but it was less than a 10 minute wait to get to the counter. There are multiple menus on the walls though, so you can decide what you want before you get there. Yay efficiency!  I ordered the bacon egg & cheese sandwich, while my friends ordered the signature Slut. We also had coffee and orange juice. Everything was just great, and price is on-point for a quick bite in Vegas (about $10 - $15 per person, depending on whether or not you get drinks). One reason I didn't get the Slut was because I was afraid the baguette would be too hard. Surprise, it isn't! I'll definitely be getting that next time.  Service was welcoming, friendly, and prompt. One of my favorite features is the open kitchen, allowing you to see everything being made fresh in front of you.   Downside is that there isn't a lot of seating. You can find somewhere in the lobby to sit, but designated tables would be a bit better.  Eggslut is definitely someplace I'd come back to for a solid hangover breakfast!",

And now, I'm even hungrier.  Got to the spot and the line was around the corner going down the hallway.  Must be good.  The line moves fast so don't give up when you see the line.  Plus, I love to people watch.  Settled on the Fairfax with turkey sausage and a cold brew coffee.  The guacho looked good but I wanted to taste the egg in eggslut.  Wait for the food was quick.  Got my sammie and coffee and I planted myself at the bar table.    Scrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy.  I like pork sausage but their turkey one was tasty.  Not overly spiced.  The brioche bun was warm and soft.  Perfect choice for it.  Sauce added to it nicely and didn't overpower it.  Good size.  Didn't leave me hungry.  And the cold brew was nice.    Might go back to try the other stuff.  Ubering it this time.    Do yourself a favor, drop that McMuffin and get to Eggslut.",

I visited this place a few times while I was in Vegas.   * The Fairfax is amazing. It's scrambled eggs with chives cheddar cheese caramelized onions and siracha mayo.  * The Eggslut was very tasty.  Lightly salted bread dipped into a jar of egg and mashed potato.  Quite innovative and tasty. * Biscuit was a bit dry but they provided side of butter and jelly.  * Freshly squeezed orange juice was great.  The simplicity of the menu is what makes them so good. Along with the organically. I'm a huge fan of only a few items because if you do one thing they will come out consistent every time. This place does some business. Turnover is quick. I recommend getting here early. The line can be long. But overall a decent breakfast experience. Will return for sure when I'm in town again!!!",

I got the Fairfax sandwich, blown away by their fluffy soft scramble, served between a warm, toasted brioche bun with spicy sriracha. Give me 2!   If you're like me and you love an old fashion chocolate chip cookie, definitely try their's! Crisp outer edge,  soft center, huge chunks of chocolate chips topped with gray salt. Sounds weird, but the gray salt really compliments the chocolate.  The branding here of unique, whoever branded this joint clearly has a great sense of humor. Their tip jar says, \"sluts need love too\" and by their trash can, it says, \"we recycle our sluts.\" Haha!   Definitely worth trying though it is a tad pricey for something so simple!",

Came here around 2 in the morning for a snack and ordered a cheeseburger. The wait was quite a while, for it was pretty busy at this time... Was with a friend and the food was under his name. Apparently they had misspelled his name and mispronounced it, so we had to go up to them and double-check on why he hasn't been called. Figured out the confusion and finally got our food. The quality of the burger compared to the one in LA was much lower. It was drier and tasted less fresh...as if the patties have been sitting out elsewhere for a while. While trying to finish the burger, there seemed to be a conflict between a customer and the staff at the counter...causing the customer to leave angrily without her food, and the staff reacting in an extremely unprofessional and rude manner. The fact that this place is open almost 24 hours, on the Strip, in front of Marquee nightclub, says a lot about the service and apparently the food quality. I wouldn't come back again.",

After what seemed like an eternity they finally called out my order. Although I think it only seemed that long because it was my first meal of the day. I took a first bite and enjoyed the texture and home feeling of the meal at once. It felt like a comfort food. Paired with the toast it was an excellent addition.

I was all great!!!!!  The only reason not 5 is because I'm a bread head and while the biscuit was good, it needed to be heated just a tad more so the butter could easily be spread! But other than that KUDOS!!! :))  Had about a 30 min wait around 12:15PM. Will def go back!!!",

    "text": "Had breakfast here on a Tuesday morning around 11am.  The line took about 20 minutes to order.  This ain't in the same league as any McD's breakfast sandwich so put yourself in that mindset when you're shelling $8.50 per sandwich.  I ordered the Fairfax which is overflowing with the most luscious custardy scrambled eggs, probably fortified with cream and/or butter.  They're so unctuous they;ve just barely crossed the line from fully liquid to spoonable curds.   Eggs cooked like this have an intense eggi-ness that makes them a treat rather than mundane.  They also don't fluff up with air like traditional scrambled eggs so I suspect my sandwich actually had 3 or 4 eggs on it to give it volume.  The brioche bun could barely hold my last few bites together so I was shamelessly using my fingertips to scoop up the last curds of scrambled eggs and shoveling them into my mouth.  At these prices, Eggslut should be considered a splurge and a treat and not an everyday  breakfast joint.  With that mindset totally worthy it.    Other people in my group ordered the sous vide eggs served with toast sticks and bacon egg sandwiches.  Everyne raved about their food.  Hubby sang praises for their thick sliced bacon which was more meaty than the grisly salty stuff at the grocery store.    Limited seating - basically just one long counter with bar stools so you might want to plan on taking it to go.",

The steak sandwich was good, but the egg sandwich was killer. I loved it, it was great. It makes me want to brave the long ass lines in DTLA, which luckily you won't experience here at the LV location. The lines are short and quick here! Prices are reasonable here too.

I'm from Los Angeles and I'll tell you the location over there is much better and it's essentially for one reason and one reason only, PRICE POINT. At the same time it makes sense because we are in Vegas and the location itself is in the cosmopolitan!   The sandwich itself was extremely good. I had the sausage egg sandwiches with added avocado. The total came out to 15 dollars for the sandwich and a cup of orange juice. Nothing amazing about the juice itself but the sand which definitely hit the spot after a long night of partying. Just the right amount of applewood smoked bacon and avocado, and the ketchup was extremely good as well.   All in all I would recommend it if you have plenty of time. The line always stretches around the place itself and will take you about 30 minutes to order and get your food. Is it worth the wait? I personally don't think so. 4stars for the sandwich being good.",

    "text": "My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. Our last day we decided to grab some food before heading to the airport. We decided to try Eggslut because a friend had recommended it. The line was wrapped around the corner with probably 50 people waiting to order, but we had time so we got in line. It took about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line and order our food. Once we ordered, it took about another 20-25 minutes until our food was ready.   Food: Awesome. The bacon, egg & cheese sandwich was wonderful. It had Applewood smoked bacon, eggs, cheddar cheese, chipotle ketchup, and caramelized onions on a bun. I am a fairly picky eater and would normally ask them to leave off the onions and ketchup... but I was so hungry I forgot to ask them to leave it off. It didn't matter because I ate the entire thing and loved every bite! I also ordered a side biscuit and it was good... a little cold, but still good. My friend got the cheeseburger and said it was great, too.  Prices: Very reasonable. I think my total was around $18 for the sandwich, side biscuit, and a can of diet coke. Not bad at all in Vegas.   Service: Although there wasn't much interaction with the staff since there is no sit down service here, they were still very friendly at the cash register and didn't seem stressed even though the place was packed.  Atmosphere: Just know there aren't many places to sit here. The restaurant is in a corner with not many tables and chairs for seating. The tables were full every time we happened to walk by. However, there were some sofas and extra seating areas around the corner so that was fine.  Overall, great place, awesome food. Next time I am in Vegas I will be back!",

The Slut - oh, where to start? Just order it. With the amazing potato puree the texture was incredible and off-set by the baguette.",

Now that the vegas location has opened, it has been my casual breakfast/brunch go-to spot.   Yes, the queue is long. Yes, there's a lot of hype about this place. Yes, the hype is worth it. The key is going during off hours (if you can). From my experience, off-hours include weekdays not during breakfast or lunch. I know, I know - this is a breakfast/brunch spot, but if you have a flexible schedule or don't mind waiting in the queue for 20-30 minutes, then you're all good.   I've tried all of their breakfast sandwiches, burger and fresh squeezed OJ. I have zero complaints about any of their items except that the OJ is so good that I end up drinking it in 3 large sips or less.   To some, their price point may seem high for an egg sandwich ($8) and OJ ($5), but if you compare it to a sit-down restaurant, it's actually much lower (and much better tasting).  I'll never turn down the option of going there, I'm a fan for life.",

And once you are seated you want to enjoy your meal but it's hard because you have other people looking for a seat and they are just walking around you hoping you will leave your seat soon. 4 stars for the food but it only stays at 4 until they make a bigger and better seating area.",

The tri tip was flavorful and super tender. It was the most tender tri tip I ever had. The egg was cooked perfectly. I love runny yolks! The sandwich also had a chimmichurri sauce and arugula. I never been a huge fan of arugula, but it went very well.   This place isn't huge and sometimes the wait is super long when you go during busy hours. My recommendation is go in the middle of the night LOL! To be honest, I felt like it was kinda overpriced for something you can make at home, but they do make a good sandwich and the hype really draws in the line. If you're looking for a midnight snack, this is good place to try.",

(Line got longer after us) I got a turkey sausage eggwich ($8). It was slightly above average. Sausage, egg, and brioche buns were fresh. Honey mustard aioli was tasty. They ran out of sluts, so we knew we had to come back...  The next day! There was a 15-20 min line around 12:30pm. Omg they were out of sluts again... but I was really happy with my gaucho sandwich ($15). The wagyu beef was so tender and juicy! It's a lot of meat--very filling. I highly recommend going for this one.  Later at 6pm, we were determined to get our slut ($10). Hallelujah they had it! We broke the yolk and dipped our baguettes. Super yummy! The potato puree and coddled egg were the best combination. I love eggs and potatoes so this item was made for me. The mason jar (they reuse them so don't throw them away) was cute. I'm glad we finally got to try it before leaving Vegas :)  Suggestions for improvement: -Serve water cups -Make more sluts so you don't run out",

    "text": "Love coming here for breakfast whenever i'm in Vegas! Located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan, it's pretty easy to spot as it's the only place that ever has a longass line...! Line moves decently fast though, and food comes out at a steady pace. Compared to the line in LA (which can take up to an hour!!!), this is wayyyy easier.  I usually go for the sausage egg and cheese sandwich, which is always on point, but sometimes their soft scrambled eggs in the fairfax sandwich really hits the spot. Both are good, and if you have the appetite, try both!!! They're packed with flavor even though they're both pretty simple breakfast sandwiches.  I think the slut (basically potato puree and an egg) isn't worth it...super expensive and nothing special.",

You can see the cooks actually cracking open eggs to make over easy eggs. The bacon is not sad slivers of dry pre-cooked packaged bacon! It is raw slabs slapped on the griddle to brown.   The brioche bun is warm and soft as you bite into it. I got the Fairfax with turkey sausage and had to wait awhile because they had just used the last big pot of scrambled eggs and had to make a fresh batch. Yes! Fresh scrambled eggs not premade and not being poured from a prepared carton!   The result! A delicious egg bun treat served up fresh and warm!   Orange juice is the real deal too. I could taste the bitter from the peel, so I'm guessing they press the whole orange. Yummy!   Now I understand the lines. And there are always lines. The line does move. I was lucky and went when the one was just halfway down the hall. Best time to go is around 3:40pm before closing for no line. But it's worth a 20 min wait. I don't know about longer. That crazy is up to you.",

Service was good, however my order took longer to come out because the guy that serves the order also had to clear the tables.  I ordered:  The Fairfax - had good heat to it with the sriracha mayo, love the brioche bun.  I have heard from a number of people that this place is so good, a must have. In my opinion, this place is overrated. Yes, it's a good breakfast sandwich, but that is what it is, a breakfast sandwich.  For that price your taste buds should be blown away.

I got the Fairfax (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) and added turkey sausage. I definitely suggest adding the sausage. My husband's Sausage, Egg, & Cheese (turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun) was devoured so quickly that I didn't even get to taste it! But he said it was also really good - as if I needed more info.  I get a little antsy with food establishments where you're not sure if you're going to get a seat, but people move through pretty quickly, and there are many other places you can sit if you end up having to do takeaway.  As you might or might not expect, the vibe here is on the younger side. Even if you're not hungover, the person sitting next to you likely is. You're in good company.",

    "text": "If you want to go here on a weekend, come EARLY. As in like, morning early. Because if you get here in the middle of the day like 12pm-1pm, you will wait in line for a while. We waited in line for about an hour and then once we ordered our food, it took about 15-20 minutes to come out. There are a couple tables and stools as well as some tables across the walkway so you have to be on the lookout when there's an open space and take it for yourself.  The way they make it is like an assembly line. You have one person making the eggs, making the bacon, putting the sandwiches together, etc. I noticed that the guy cooking the eggs would throw away an egg he cracked on the pan if it wasn't perfect, so you see the standards that they hold themselves to.   I ordered the Fairfax ($8.50) which seems to be their most popular sandwich. It's scrambled eggs with cheese and some caramelized onions. It's REALLY fluffy and soft and you'll bite right through it with ease. It was good but I was not full by the end of the meal and I was a bit disappointed.  A friend did say that he added bacon and avocado to his Fairfax and it was really good so I guess those couple extra dollars make a big difference in the meal. That could potentially be a bad sign knowing that in order to really enjoy it you have to spend a total of $13+ on a sandwich that will not fill you up.   Don't expect too much like I did but it is nice for those who want to get the slutty experience.",

Maybe I was hungry or in need of food after laying out at the pool all day we got the gaucho and the slut.  If you've never had eggslut, the slut is interesting and should be tried, but I don't think I would get it again, it sits very heavy in your stomach probably from all the potato puree.  the mixture of the seasonings and egg really go well together though especially on the baguette toasts.  I would however come back for the gaucho.  It's made of wagyu tri tip, the flavors witht he arugula and seasoning and then the fried egg.... it was sooo goood. the only complaint from my boyfriend was it wasn't big enough and he was still hungry.  I would probably eat that and be full for reference though.  Not sure if it's the same prices as socal or since it's vegas but the sandwich was  $14 and the slut was $10.  There's not a ton of seating like one bar that allows you to sit facing strangers (which you often do).  Try the slut if you're curious but if you only get to order one thing.... I would get the gaucho. mmmmmmm",

It was very nice inside, as expected for food joints and restaurants in the hotels of the strip. I looked at the menu and it was unexpectedly small. I didn't know much about the place, besides it being so hyped up by everyone I know. I finally chose the egg salad sandwich since I wasn't feeling anything too heavy. Fortunately, the egg salad tasted really good just like home. But that was the problem: I was expecting it to be different and more than just an egg salad I make at home. And it was more expensive than it should have been. I was disappointed and I don't think I'd be back unless I wanted something quick or to burn up time in LV. It was delicious but I just thought it'd be better.",

We waited in line for probably 45 min but we decided to wait because it must be amazing.  Finally we get to the front of the line and we order 4 bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches with 4 biscuits.  After ordering you want in another line for your food.  The most annoying thing about the line for your food is it isn't first come first serve.  There were approximately 5 customers behind us that got their food before us.  Just doesn't make sense and I looked at their food and it was the same as ours.  We didn't order anything complex with our sandwiches either.  One person said no chipotle ketchup.  So that upset me.  We finally get our food and you have to fight for a table as there is no place to sit.  Luckily, a group saw us standing there and they finished quickly so we can have their table.  We sat down and the tables were just disgusting.  A lady came to refill the napkin box and I asked her to clean the filthy table.  See attached picture.  She rolled her eyes and said, \"I have to fill the napkins first then I'll come back.\"  So about 15 min later if sitting there with our food getting cold, she comes back and wipes off the table.  I've been staying at the cosmo for some time and I guarantee we will not come back here again.",

I believe it's because they use cage fee eggs which aren't the best tasting but definitely the most healthy. Known for its egg slut, I decided to order the slut. It came with 3 pieces of baguette, and a side of coddled egg mixed with potato puree and other ingredients. It kinda tastes like semi raw eggs and gravy. It was egg cellent... but the meal itself was really over easy because it's such a small portion! The other thing I got was the sausage egg and cheese sandwich. Compiled with homemade turkey sausage and over medium egg it wasn't the best tasting. It was pretty salty. If I were to come back it would be for the egg slut... I guess these sluts are loyal. Service was great, I mean all you do is order at the counter and they call your name when the food is ready. I love the concept of an open kitchen because it guarantees freshness and that nothing happens to your food!",

We had to wait for a pretty long time not only to order our food but also getting our food. When we finally had our meal, we sat down in the lounge seated across the way in the Cosmopolitan. The egg and bacon sandwich I had was great and it came in a cute little brown bag for packaging. Besides the long wait, it was great so I suggest go early or when you have time to spare!",

The egg slut is basically a coddled egg with pureed potatoes and chives and salt... very yummy... the gaucho sandwich was very tasty as well... it's on the sour side so you have to like sour to eat this... probably the chimichurri sauce makes it sour but my son loved it.. And the salted chocolate chip cookie is the bomb! We had to go back and get a second one... they also toast it to make it melty! I like it a lot but the prices are pretty steep for the amount of food you get, but then again it is Vegas! YOLO!",

Once you order, the the wait for the food is pretty fast.   Food-  -Slut - This is definitely what a lot of people come here for! It's basically egg with what tastes like mashed potatoes and chives sprinkled on top. It comes with a few slices of baguette and is tasty together! They give a lot in the jar and we had some left over after we ate the baguettes. By itself, it was a bit salty.   -Buttermilk biscuit - I recommend this! Mostly because of the butter & maple syrup they have. It tastes best when it's warm & fresh!  -Fairfax/egg salad sandwich - If you want just eggs, I would get this! This doesn't come with any meat, but I believe you can add it for an extra charge.   -Gaucho - My favorite here! The one in LA didn't have this, so I always get this when I'm here! It's tri-tip with arugula and an egg! Super tasty and even though it's more expensive, it's also more filling. I like to substitute the bread to salad (no extra charge). They give you tri-tip & egg over an arugula salad!   Overall, this is a must-try when you're around the area! The menu is small, but it has enough variety to please most groups. They make the food very quickly so don't go too far after you order!",

Still worth every minute that we waited.   There isn't a lot of seating right outside of Eggslut but there are lots of spots to sit if you walk around a bit. The two tip sandwich was also killer!

Eggslut Las Vegas is located in the Cosmo on the second floor across from Marquee, hence the line at 3am on Sunday morning. Third visit was on Christmas day. It was pretty busy and food quality definitely decreased.   You have to order The Slut if you come to Eggslut! Its my favorite item on the menu. Prior to going I had no idea it has mashed potatoes in it. They give you a good amount of bread with it but feel free to ask for more. I usually order the Fairfax sandwich and add bacon. Ive also tried their biscuit.   Overall if you'd rather have a super early breakfast after a night out in Vegas over Secret Pizza then why not give Eggslut a try. Better as drunchie food versus hangover food lol",

Now, I finally got the chance to try it. Ordering was quick; there was no one in line, but receiving our orders took about 15 minutes. Many people were waiting for their orders actually, and it seemed like the lady working that station by the pick up food area was moving slowly. Other than that, the breakfast sandwich was delicious, and they had Tapatio packets which made my spicy buds happy.   I'd return if I was in the Cosmopolitan in the wee hours of the morning, drunk and hungry. Other than that, I'm glad I tried it and probably could go for something else!",

A place where you can go get a breakfast sandwich that doesn't come out of a drive through window.   The line was wrapped around the counter but moved pretty quickly. The nice thing is while you wait in line there is a menu on the wall so you can decide what you want before you reach the register.   It was a tough decision because everything sounded delicious but I settled on the Fairfax sandwich and added turkey sausage and avocado to it. This particular sandwich comes with scrambled eggs, cheddar, chives and a sirracha mayo. The eggs were perfectly cooked and not at all runny ( because eww ). The turkey sausage was tender and had really good flavor and the sirracha mayo wasn't very spicy but had just enough heat that you knew it was there.   If you're ever near an eggslut I would highly recommend giving it a chance!",

I had the Fairfax sandwich- caramelized onion, chives, cheddar cheese, and siracha mayo on scrambled eggs in a brioche bun- and loved every bit of it. As I said earlier, the scrambled eggs were super fluffy! The brioche bun is freaking delicious, and all the flavors of this sandwich melded well together. Loved the value and experience of this meal. Well worth the $10.   My friend had the Slut, of course. This egg came in a really cute jar with a creamy pureed mashed potato cushion. Flavors were much subtler. I enjoyed the texture of all components but prefered my sandwich for the flavor and size. Cost was approximately the same between our two dishes.   Overall really liked this space and the food. There's a big bunny who might remind you of a woman's anatomy and cute cracked-egg chairs! Loved the colors and the vibes. Also appreciated that I could get breakfast for  $10. Vegas food is notoriously expensive so I enjoyed this option whole-heartedly!",

The slut has wonderfully coddled eggs with perfect amount of sea salt... I could eat this every day, and never get tired. Except for the wait. I admit it gets a bit wear and tear even on a week day when it's only 30 people deep. I can't imagine the weekend or conventions when it's 150+?! Wowza!   Noms!",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure that the Eggslut LA location tastes slightly better. I had the sausage, egg and cheddar and although the brioche bun was nice and soft, the cheese perfectly melted, the egg left something to be desired. Maybe it was left on the stove longer than necessary.   The line was short at 10am, no complaints about the customer service, the only down side to this location - much like the one in la, was that there is hardly any seating.   If in Vegas I'd make a stop here for some breakfast or late snack, it's a nice break away from buffets and burger joints.",

    "text": "This eyecatching, naughtily named restaurant is a famous, trendy chain located in the restaurant area at the heart of Cosmo. Seeing as I was staying in Cosmo, I had to try it. I went early in the morning at 8am and...stood in line. It was a short line that took forever. Not the restaurants fault really more the slow people (and line cutters) to blame, but if you're in a rush, pass on this.  Their offerings are basic: medium easy egg with bread, devilled egg with bread, or their Mason jar (steamed egg?) with 'tates. Their menu is simple, which I normally love, but I expected more egg-sanity (#trademark)  than what was offered.   I ordered the breakfast sammie: turkey patty, medium easy egg, cheddar cheese on a toasted brioche bun with their eggslut sauce. At $8.50, it was quite affordable given, what I hope/expect are, quality ingredients. Anyone wanting a breakfast sandwich should definitely go here over McDonald's, but I really didn't see what the hype was about.   The turkey patty was overpowering and larger than I would've preferred. The egg, while deliciously runny and a bright hue of orange, was awkward and not centered. When I make myself eggs, you bet I shape them so that the yolk falls in the middle of the white. So, cmon ES. The brioche bread, though, was perfectly buttered and grilled... brioche pairs extremely well with egg, as it's an eggy bread itself. But beware, this sandwich packs a heavy caloric punch! I'm guessing 1000cal for this guy.   Anyway, I didn't try anything else. I hear the Mason jar egg (the namesake item) is special and amazing; but I'm not interested in trying it. I would pass on eggslut. It's just a shrug.",

    "text": "Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. I really love the name and was thrilled to give it a whirl. The line was relatively short on Thursday at noon-ish. The service was \"okay\" however I was happy to get to specialize my sandwich with no meat and added arugula. The orders were prepared correctly and we didn't have to wait long. My lunch date thought the presentation could have been better, but it was a casual to-go type eatery so I was fine with the seemingly, eco-friendly containers and wrappers. The reason for the three stars is because the brioche bun was dry (stale?) and it really impacted the sandwich in a big way. A fresh, soft bun makes a BIG difference! I would try this place again, but if I got another stale bun, I'd probably ask for a redo (even though I hate to be \"that gal/guy\").",

Polar opposite of my experience with the LA location. We got one of every sandwich with my crew and we all felt the same. Overcooked dry eggs on the Fairfax as well. It sucked and it's all hype here.

I sat there for probably 20 minutes eagerly awaiting my order. Once I took that first bite though, it was all worth it. Bacon, egg, and cheesy goodness that was made better by my balcony views of the Strip. The fresh buttermilk biscuits are made all the more delicious when spreading copious amounts of honey butter all over them. Can't wait to come back!",

I had the fairfax sand which was awesome but these breakfast sandwich scan add up real fast because it's $4 bucks just for bacon but it's the Vegas strip so what do you expect.   The menu at eggslut is relatively small but sometime simple is good. The add on item for this place are basically bacon and avocado not sure how much added avocado is. I did get the salted Carmel chocolate cookie which was awesome I'm just not sure why they heated it up 5mins and let it sit on the counter way before my sandwich was done.   The only thing I hope to see in the future is maybe the pace picks up around here because it does take forever to get your sandwich and I think it could be faster! Overall good experience but I'm going to wait awhile before I come back.",

Egg was cooked medium so it was a little runny which was perfect! Good presentation. They took the time to make it look as described. I had the \"slut\" which was coddled egg over potato puree, sea salt and chives, served along with slices of a French baguette. The flavors were soooooo Perfect. Although, my coddled egg was cooked a little medium, but I still loved it. Waiting 40 minutes for hour food wasn't really worth it, and the seating arrangements were pretty limited.

The eggburger was on a cheap high startch bun, sausage was nothing special and the egg was just and egg.  The Aioli mayo was in my opinion 90% cheap mayo and maybe 10% good Aioli.  (Really ..I've heard of watering down drinks but this goes to far).    Topping off my experience was the eggburger bursting in my hand and jetting out yoke all over my arm.

They come cloaked in melted cheddar cheese with perfectly caramelized onions giving a hint of sweetness. Surrounding these quality ingredients is a Sriracha mayo providing just enough heat to round out the whole thing. It's all served inside a warm pillowy brioche bun. I definitely recommend the addition of the avocado, it provided another layer of creaminess. I could argue that most of the textures were soft, but honestly it worked so well, I didn't miss any crunch factor.  I know Eggslut has a few locations, if you find yourself near any of them, GO.

    "text": "First, a clarification: I really, really enjoyed the food here and all of their employees were pleasant. Despite that, I can't give Eggslut a 5 or even a 4 -- too many other things irrationally piss me off about this place.  Let's talk about the crown jewel of their menu, the $10 \"Slut.\" The Slut is an egg poached in a jar resting on top of potatoes, all ingredients cooked to a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit in an immersion circulator (think sous vide). The Slut is served with diagonal baguette slices, toasted and buttered, and meant to be mixed in its jar and then scooped onto the toast points. In this way, I'd think of it as a \"breakfast appetizer\" meant to be shared between two people rather than an entree. Those reading this who have ever had an Onsen Egg (\"hot spring\" egg) at a high-end Japanese restaurant, or even experimented with eggs in your home sous-vide setup know what to expect: a perfectly cooked yolk delicately encased in silky and creamy whites. I sometimes make these eggs at home and eat them with nothing but a light sprinkle of salt. Eggslut amps up this concept, serving the eggs on top of smooth, micro-sieved pommes puree featuring a high ratio of butter to potatoes. The result is a sophisticated and very tasty \"mashed potatoes with gravy\" for breakfast.  The other item I ordered was Eggslut's $15 \"Gaucho Sandwich,\" which consisted of seared Wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions, arugula, and an egg over-medium served in a brioche bun. Fully justifying its price-tag, this may be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. The spicy chimichurri was heavy with fresh cilantro, which balanced out the slightly-bitter arugula very nicely. The steak was beefy, soft and began falling apart in my mouth in anticipation of my next chew. I acknowledge that places like Ruby Tuesday were selling $8.95 \"Kobe\" burgers last decade, which was obvious fraudulent bullshit -- but this truly may actually be real, genuine imported Wagyu beef that Eggslut is serving in their breakfast sandwich.  Here's my main problem with Eggslut: this is a restaurant that is more about ego and brand-building for tomorrow than it is about being a restaurant I want to go to today. Because if it was about being a restaurant I want to go to today, they'd figure out how to deal with the line. I got there at 7:04am on a Monday morning, a mere 4 minutes after they opened, and needed to wait in a 15 minute line. I then waited another 7 minutes for my food. The ownership seems to not understand that this is Las Vegas and that I have options galore. And, yes, I am convinced the line is intentional. They've been open long enough that they could have adjusted their prices, hired additional capacity, or done any number of things to fix this -- but they won't, because of ego. \"Look at me! No one else has a line like this! I must be doing something right!\"  My second problem with this place is that their automated POS asks for a tip (15% 20% etc.) when you pay at the order counter. I entered a tip in out of habit, not realizing that there is no table delivery to speak of. You basically wait around in an area, they call your name, and you grab your grub, no differently than you would at Burger King. No one in their right mind would give a 20% tip at Burger King.  My third problem is that although I don't have an issue with the price of their food items (because they were both really good), I did have a problem with them charging $5 for a cup of orange juice in a fast-casual setting. That's just exploitative and lousy.  So, yeah, great food... but I'm afraid I can't give these people any more of my money until they fundamentally change a few extremely annoying aspects of their business.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.5/3.5/NA",

Their biscuits are also worth it, and they come with a delicious honey butter. Lines are long, but they move fast. This is definitely the place for breakfast after a night out!",

Would've easily been cheaper with sandwiches but we paid $10 for water. No bueno. Overall it's a good spot for a quick breakfast and the seating area is super cute with an Alice in Wonderland feel. Try it, it's worth it.",

When we got to egg slut there was a line wrapping around but it only took us 15 minutes to get to the order area. We got the slut, gaucho and the fairfax. After ordering it took another 15 minutes to get our food. I thought the fairfax and gaucho were both okay. They felt pretty greasy. It's honestly food combinations I've had before and a friend commented that they could make this same sandwich at home if they tried. Obviously both were a couple steps up from a fast food breakfast sandwich but it wasn't spectacular. The slut was basically an egg on top of mashed potatoes. Again it was okay but I think this place is overrated. I would rather try other breakfast places then come back here again. It was filling but didn't match everything I've heard before coming here.",

From what I heard others say, those that arrived when the restaurant opened around 8 AM got through in 5-10 minutes. When it was my turn, obviously, I ordered the signature dish, \"The Slut,\" but I also felt the need to order the Florentine sandwich for a late lunch later, given the amount of time I spent waiting in line. The star dish tasted like a mix of eggs and mashed potatoes and herbs served with three pieces of bread, and left you with a feeling that your soul was nourished. The dish, though tasty, was not life-shattering and given the high cost, it is something I'd only order for the novelty factor. I was hungry 5 minutes later; maybe this was because I chose not to spring for the coffee or orange juice additions. Thankfully I had ordered the traditional breakfast sandwich, the Florentine, which did the job of satiating my hunger and leaving me with a much more positive impression of Egg Slut.",

The line for eggslut here is ridiculous but it actually goes by pretty fast. It wraps to the end of the hallway but it probably took me about 35 minutes to get to the front and wait 10 minutes for my sandwich to get out. Hey, it's faster than room service and cheaper!!! I usually get the slut or Fairfax but I ventured out to the egg salad sando and it's a great \"lighter\" alternative to other options on the menu. It was creamy but fresh and the warm brioche bun is always consistently fluffy and addicting. The staff is super nice and they work efficiently for sure! Will always be back when in Vegas!",

Something that's not shiny marble, sparkling marquee, decked out in crystals but rather, something that's just straight up good food without flair. Enter Eggslut in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  Crazy name aside, it's just a place serving up a darn good egg sandwich. I had the egg and cheese sandwich. The Fairfax also looked really good, but when given the choice between a fried egg and one that is, well not fried, it's always wisest to opt for the fried egg. Keep in mind they don't have packets of salt and pepper which is a bit weird for a breakfast joint, but they're happy to give you some salt and pepper in little plastic cups.  Oh, and it's important to note the coffee is pretty terrible here and you'd be much better off walking to the Starbucks in the lobby of the Cosmopolitan.",

I first discovered this breakfast spot while watching a Buzzfeed Tasty series called \"Friend in Town.\" They featured the Fairfax and it came highly recommended.   The Las Vegas location is in theCosmopolitan where I decided to try the Fairfax for myself. Creamy scrambled eggs, melty cheese, rest between a flakey brioche bun, I of course had to add a helping of avocado to mine. I didn't want to finish eating this sandwich and you couldn't ask for much more from a breakfast. The only warning I would have to give you is the wait time, but it goes fast, and is 100% worth it.",

We came here after our hot air balloon ride, since the meet up/drop off spot was close to the Cosmopolitan. They actually ended up dropping us off at the Cosmo, which was really nice.   The goal was to get food, eat the food, and then go back to our hotel for a nap since we had gotten up at 4:30am that morning. The line was long but it went by very quickly. The ladies at the counter were super nice and very helpful.   I split the Fairfax Sandwich (cage-free soft scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) and the Slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar and topped with gray salt). To be honest, both were super delicious in their own way. It's really hard to decide which one was better!   The soft scrambled eggs in the Fairfax Sandwich were really soft and gooey - really hit the spot. But the Slut was also really good - the potato and egg mixed together very well and tasted great both on the toasted baguette and by itself.",

The fresh squeezed OJ, wasn't that great and I don't know when they squeezed it but it didn't taste fresh. I also got the biscuit which was average at best. It was still cold when I got it, pretty dry, and not that great with syrup. The sausage sandwich was okay. The egg was phenomenal and the brioche bun was amazing but the sausage fell short for me.  The service is good and quick and the place is very clean.   This has a really casual atmosphere which was great because I was traveling alone and still had my backpack but seating is very limited. I would take it to go if you're in a big group or with kids. If you're looking for a quick breakfast, this is not it.",

A friend, my husband and I decided to come here for brunch 2 weeks ago on a Saturday morning after a night of somewhat hard partying in Vegas. We were all cranky and in need of carbs, cheese and grease to soak up the activities from the night before. After waiting what seemed for what seemed like a life time ( 30 Minutes ) we finally got to the front of the line to order our food. I got the Fairfax sandwich with a cookie and a biscuit  my hubby got the Gaucho. My sandwich was absolutely amazing !! Their sriracha mayo mixed with their scrambled eggs were exactly what I needed to get me out of my funk and to give me a kick to wake up and snap out of my bad mood. Probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches' I've ever eaten in my entire life.  Due to my martial obligation I had to give my husband a bite of my sandwich which I did reluctantly. He was totally blown away , he even said my sandwich was much better than his. My biscuit was unfortunately cold but it tasted like it would have been amazing if it was heated up. I absolutely recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, even as a snack. Delicious !!!!!!!!",

The $8 price each was reasonable for the Strip, but a waste of $ in this case. Maybe the other menu items were better. Let's hope.",

    "text": "We didn't get to try Eggslut in LA so we were happy there was this recently opened location in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  The line was long around breakfast time and took about 30 minutes but it was definitely worth it.  We ordered their signature dish the Slut and one of their breakfast sandwiches the Fairfax.  The Slut came in a little glass cup and about 4-5 pieces of bread and was very tasty and unique.  The portion for the Slut was on the smaller side and it might not be enough food for some folks as a standalone dish.  The Fairfax was filling and came with scrambled eggs, cheese and sriracha mayo on a soft brioche bun.  Both awesome choices and we could definitely see ourselves coming her regularly if we lived near one of their locations.  It's also conveniently located across from Cosmo's Marquee night club and open late for those club go-ers.  We were so inspired by their Slut dish that we even tried to make it once we got back home with mixed results.",

HIGHLY recommend the Gaucho if you're a steak fan. It's cooked medium-well-ish, VERY well seasoned, and the brioche bun is everything! It's just the right size, $15, but with a more than healthy portion of meat. I should've known better than to buy water (~$5 for 20oz Life Water!!). Eh, what are you gonna do!

Located one floor above the casino at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, it is a central location no matter where you are at on the Las Vegas Strip.   The line to order can get a little long at times, you'll notice the line forks to the hallway leading to the restrooms to the left of the restaurant. However, the staff moves very quickly and moves through the line quickly.   For menu choices, they have a variety of breakfast sandwiches, along with their specialty, the Slut. All entree choices are below $10. We ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, which was a large portion and was really flavorful. We didn't get anything to drink. We asked for ice water, and were told they didn't have it there, but we could get it from any bar. We were able to get ice water from the Chandelier bar, immediately behind the restaurant.  If you're looking for a cheap but tasty breakfast, give Eggslut a shot!",

Nothing fancy, but just awesome and tasty. I have also had the breakfast sandwich here and that too was good, but I keep returning for yet another slut.   There has been a bit of a line every time I've come, but this place is worth the wait. You will thank me later. There is seating available, and I haven't had any difficulty finding a place to sit.

No wait at all to order but definitely a long wait for food.  My friend and I shared the Slut and Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich. They were both tasty but it didn't wow us enough to want to come back when there is a long line like others have waited. I would recommend getting the Slut though, have not come across another restaurant that serves a dish like this.  Tip: You order at the cashier and they'll give you your receipt with a number on it that you'll use to claim your food later. You seat yourself and clear away your dishes on your own once you're done.",

Even though there were more than 40 people in line, we only stayed in line maybe 20 minutes.  They had the menu posted around the corner where the line started so it made it easier for people to view it as they stood in line waiting to place their order.   They only had two cashier's but I am telling you, the place ran like a well-oiled machine! There were maybe eight seats at the bar and maybe four or  five tables in the restaurant. The place was pretty small but there were other places around the restaurant where one could sit and eat.  I kept it really simple and got the bacon egg and cheese biscuit. I must say hands down, this was the best bacon egg and cheese biscuit I've ever had in my life! If I could have gone back and gotten another, I would have. But let me just say, one was enough. Two would have been me being greedy but it would have been worth it. After all, I was in Vegas! My only complaint about this place is they don't have a restraunt in Charlotte! Hahaha",

The vibes were just like home - the bone thugz blasting and workers just enjoying the grind really reminded me of Los Angeles & made me miss home.   If you've read my LA Grand Central Market review, I always get the same thing at Eggslut: *FAIRFAX (cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun) - The scrambled eggs are always luscious and beautiful.   SUBBING THE BRIOCHE FOR THE BISCUIT IS CRITICAL. It adds a delicious butteriness and touch of savoriness. Also, this location didn't charge me extra for the substitution! Do note that you won't be hungry at a normal lunch hour after having this baby.  We also ordered their signature slut (cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette)..because you have to at Eggslut. It's like mashed potatoes with extra protein from the egg. Love it. I like that this location has a clear area (to the right of the food pick up) to recycle your jars!   84/365",

I ordered the Fairfax with avocado and bacon while my cousin got the sausage, egg and cheese. They are quite impressive breakfast sandwiches. The Fairfax scrambled eggs were incredibly fluffy, soft, creamy. It was just an amazing texture and there should be no other way to have scrambled eggs. The only thing I would've liked more is if the sriracha mayo was spicier. It needed more of a kick and that would elevate the sandwich so much more.  The sausage, egg and cheese was really tasty! Loved the spices and flavours of the sausage patty. The egg is yolky, so it does get a little messy to eat so just a fair warning! But it's a delicious mess.  It is on the pricier side, but I do think it was worth the wait.",

Service: we were here on a weekday at 10am and waited about half an hour in line before we could order but the orders were filled quickly. My order came out within 10 minutes. Everybody was friendly and looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs.  Food:  Gaucho: (5/5)   Seared wagyu tri-tip steak, cage-free over medium egg, chimichurri, red onions and dressed arugula in a warm brioche bun. Tri-Tip: Snake River Farms, Boise ID.   I thought theyd give me tiny slices of wagyu but there was quite a generous amount. It was tender, juicy, and filling. The chimichurri complimented it well. The brioche bun was light and sweet with an egg glaze (yes the bun matters to me). The arugula was fresh. The egg was in deed over medium. I would 100% recommend. Everything else looked good but my asian family has been adding over easy eggs to everything to make it taste even better for a long time so it wasnt anything special to me. I.e. i wouldnt wait in line for anything other than the gaucho.  Overall: 4/5 recommendation for everything else 5/5 if youre hung over",

To be honest, the line at 2am wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but yes there's still a long line.  If you're in the mood for it, it hits the spot but it is VERY RICH with the potatoes and egg and all of that yumminess (return the mason jars!!!) or you can get a sandwich but it all kind of goes THUMP into your stomach.  That said, secret pizza would probably do the same, but somehow I feel like pizza isn't quite as heavy.    Limited counter seating.  If the line is wrapping around going down the hall next door, well yep, you're going to be waiting A LONG TIME.  I won't wait that long, but if the line isn't too bad, I'll stand in line behind 3-4 people.  Not 30-40 though.",

    "text": "I had to give Eggslut at Cosmo a try to see how it compared to the LA original.  Having just had breakfast, I just got the Slut since I remember liking it so much.  I remember thinking $9 for a Slut was a lot, so $10.50 was almost torture to pay.  But hey, this is Vegas, where money has no value.  So what the heck, I went for it.  I'm not sure if it was because I just had breakfast or if it was the sticker shock, but it was not as good as I remembered it being.  The potato puree at the bottom was really thick and not nearly the creamy texture I remember it.  The egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk having a texture between runny and hard.  I wish it came with more than three pieces of bread, but this is a problem I had with it in LA as well, so I knew what I was going to get here.  I have a feeling most people who visit Eggslut for the first time don't know about the Slut, so they don't sell very many per hour.  Because of this, the Sluts sit in the water bath for too long and the potato puree loses its nice texture.  Overall, it felt like I should have saved my $11 or put it on a roll of the roulette wheel.  For those with an immersion circulator and want to replicate their egg, their water bath is plainly visible and the temp is 142F.",

    "text": "Went for breakfast on a Tuesday around 10:00AM there was about a ten minute wait. They did seem to be very busy, but there was clearly a method to the madness! I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. I don't like runny eggs so I asked for over hard. I also liked the sound of the sriracha mayo over the chipotle ketchup that comes with the sandwich, so I asked for a substitute and this was not a problem. After ordering, it was probably another 10 minutes before my food was ready. There were some stools in the area, so I sat down and waited. They do call your name when your food is done, so I would suggest sticking close until you receive your food. My sandwich was hot and exactly as I requested.   This is not a 5 star review because the sandwich was honestly pretty standard. There was nothing spectacular or earth shattering happening here. Maybe the brioche makes it special, but I've had a breakfast sandwich on brioche before. Bread is bread to me. There are many places on the strip that have breakfast sandwiches that are just as good for True same price.",

I would give it a 5 star if I'm just drunk out of Marquee at 2am.  I ordered the eggslut and the gaucho sandwich.   The eggslut will always be the classic must order. It's so flavorful and the texture is just right on the tongue.   The gaucho was surprising to me because it's on the sour side. The steak is well prepared and very tender.   I would come back here for a quick breakfast but it is not worth the waiting like beyond 15 minutes. I recommend going in at around 3pm or 2am!",

The egg slipped out of the sandwich into the wrapper though so it was thoroughly messy trying to put it back in place and eat this thing. The chipotle ketchup was a nice touch. I would have liked the bread to be warmer/toasted but the bread itself was yummy.   The overall situation was crazy though (hence the four stars). The line literally stretched around the spot and all the way down a very long hallway. It took about 30 minutes alone between the time we exited the hallway and we got our food!

I think it was worth the wait, and yes, get their early if you don't want to stand in the very long line and wait around for a table.   The Slut delivered it's promise of a delicious pureed potatoes and a poached egg. I wish I had more of the bread it came with because it gave the dish that toasty texture it needed to contrast all the silkiness. I also got the cornbread, which was not bad. It was flaky, but just a little greasy. But you had to have the honey butter with it, and it righted the tiny wrong.   My friend had the breakfast sandwich with beef, and unfortunately it was over cooked, so it was tough. They cook a lot ahead of time since the menu is small, so they might've let it rest for too long.   I went to the one in DTLA, and was aware of the line. So I shouldn't have been surprised to see the long lines at their Vegas location. There isn't a lot of seating, and the bar area across won't let you use their tables. Turn around time isn't quick as people tend to savor the meal. And why wouldn't you after waiting in that long line.   But I would brave the line for the Slut again.",

    "text": "I've heard rave reviews about Eggslut for years now, and even though I'm a frequent Vegas visitor I've never been awake/alive early enough to beat the huge lines, and usually too hung over to wait an hour for a breakfast sandwich. On this most recent trip, I caught an early morning flight to Vegas and had a few hours to kill before my room was ready, so I wandered over to see what all the hype was about. The key is definitely getting here early - I got here around 745 and there were only 5-6 people in line; I had a sandwich in hand in about 15. There isn't much of a dining room other than a long counter space with high top chairs, though there is currently an Alice in Wonderland themed dining area in the Cosmo that is shared by a couple different eateries.   Anyways, on to the important stuff. One bite of the Gaucho sandwich and I'm a believer! I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, and this just about knocks every other one out of the park. $15 might seem a big steep, but every element of this sandwich was absolute perfection. My sandwich easily had 10 generous slices of super tender tri tip. The egg is a perfect gooey over medium, and the brioche is buttery and light and fluffy but holds up well to the hefty sandwich. I'm not sure what magic they add to their chimichurri sauce, but it's downright addicting and I'd like to order it by the gallon, please and thank you. The lightly dressed arugula is also a nice touch, and balances out the richness of the steak and egg. I'm a complete cheese addict and usually add it to everything, but I didn't miss it at all in this sandwich.   Now... can we please start a petition to add Eggslut to Postmates? I'd love to nurse my hangovers with some eggy steaky goodness in the comfort of my hotel room :)",

We stopped in as we were leaving Vegas to head to Zion, so we got to Eggslut as some people were just getting in from a night out, so the line was practically non existent.  They have your traditional egg breakfast sandwiches, overpriced for normal standards, but for Vegas hotel food standards, it was reasonably priced.    The two sandwiches came out quickly and we sat in their little common area in the Cosmopolitan.  I did in fact fancy the sandwich and it was a perfect start to the day (I am with parasite so I ended up ordering donuts from across the way as well, but that's not Eggslut's fault I was still hungry) I have seen reviews and pictures of the line later on in the evening/very early morning and I personally would not go at that time.  Best to do so around 8 AM if you're magically up at that time!  Defining worth a visit, especially since \"slut\" is in the name, too!",

    "text": "Review 3/3 of our Cosmopolitan Las Vegas \"quick dining\" journey in late December. I have wanted to try Eggslut for a couple of years now but have always been turned away by the length of the ever present line up at this breakfast sandwich spot.  On Boxing Day we flew in to Vegas, checked in to The Bellagio, and headed off in search of some breakfast before hitting The Strip for the day. We decided to heck the line up at Eggslut and were once again met by a snaking list of humanity that went wayyyyyy back past the restrooms in the hallway behind the restaurant. I was ready to move on as I have a few times before, but heather decided we would wait it out this time.  We waited in line well over an hour, ordered, then waited another half hour to 45 minutes to get called for our food. Heather ordered the Sausage, Egg and Cheese sandwich and I opted for the Gaucho, which featured waygu tri tip steak and chimchurri  sauce and seemed way too delicious to pass on.  The sandwiches were fantastic. As delicious as we had expected. The fresh, warm brioche buns that they are served on are scrumptious. I loved that the eggs are served over medium and have a hint of delicious, messy, runny yolk. Everything about these sandwiches are amazing, although they are a tad pricey ($28 plus for two sandwiches).  My only complaint here is that they need to refine how they move food and customers through. They have a ton of staff, all working hard, but everything seems to be at a standstill. There has to be a better way. Two hours from time of arrival to time leaving for a breakfast sammy is ridiculous and what will prevent me from returning until it has been rectified...",

Their sandwiches and burgers where made simply but there was like a magic ingredient in it that makes it very delicious. I don't know why other people don't like it as much but this suits my palate.  There is always a line here but the service was fast and its not so bad.   There is a limited sitting.",

I was probably in line for 15 minutes before I got to the front. There was one lady working the register but the line was moving and she was friendly.   I had the fair fax sandwich with bacon, the egg slut and an orange juice. All of that was about $30, expensive yes but tasty and if not better than their LA location. The eggs were so fluffy and the sandwich was pretty big. I enjoyed the toasted brioche with the egg slut. The orange juice was freshly squeezed but small in portion for $5. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be made, so overall about a 30 minute wait on a Sunday morning.",

    "text": "The best egg sandwich in the nation hands down. I always make sure I stop by at this iconic egg sandwich shop at Cosmo whenever I'm in Vegas. My favorite is the fairfax sandwich with scrambled egg and spicy aioli sauce. The first bite just melts in the mouth. I think they put milk or something in the egg scramble to make it soft. It's fluffy and so soft almost like cream. The spicy aioli make it even better. And their brioche bun! I can't even explain how good it is. It's full of butter and oil, it's really good. Also, my next favorite is the classic bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. They put a lot of thick bacon strips so if you like bacon, it's worth every penny. I like bacon but it was a bit much for me and also a bit salty, so I took out a couple of strips. I haven't tried the slut but maybe I'll try it next time.  Line is usually long in the morning but it sort of dies in the afternoon. If you don't want to wait, then go in the afternoon but they do close a bit early at 7pm.",

If you are staying at another hotel it's not necessarily a place you need to go to if it's a bit of a walk.   Always expect a line and as usual not cheap food. I wouldn't wait longer than 30 minutes if you are a good judge of line movement. I was in line for probably about 15 minutes and waited only about 5 minutes to receive my food. Not bad at all.   I ordered the egg salad sandwich and my husband ordered the sausage/egg/cheese sandwich. I would recommend either of these sandwiches. I usually love a good bacon/egg/cheese but I wasn't in the mood for that heavy of a breakfast sandwich. The egg salad sandwich definitely hit the spot. Perfect quantity and great seasoning. I also ordered a salted chocolate chip cookie. Not really worth the price but my husband is a fanatic for cookies so it was my treat.   Seating can be an issue because it is not an enclosed restaurant and only few seats available. While I stood in line to order my husband stalked to seat scene for us. But the food comes out quick so previous diners usually move quick.",

I love the Fairfax sandwich with its fluffy scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. Equally delicious is the golden brioche bun that the sandwich comes on. My boyfriend's favorite is the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. We usually like to come early, but even this past time (at 7:45 am), there was already a line wrapped around the place. As seating is limited, I would suggest getting here when they first open at 7am, or otherwise have a late breakfast here to avoid the longer wait. But even if you do have to wait in line, these delicious breakfast sandwiches are worth the wait!!!",

After a long night on the Strip, I convinced my group to take an Uber here as we were all hungry and I thought some egg sandwiches could maybe alleviate their pending hangovers.   We ordered a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich, 2 Sluts and 2 Gaucho sandwiches. The sandwiches were unfortunately bland and too dry. The buns were a bit stale. At $15 a pop, I expected the Gaucho to be exquisite (they use tri-tip wagyu), but the meat was chewy and severely lacked seasoning. I think some kind of sauce or aioli would've elevated the sandwiches more, but alas they just fell short of my expectations. I didn't get to try the Slut because my mates inhaled it, but that at least indicated its deliciousness.   I may try it again the next time I'm in Vegas or maybe visit one of the other locations in CA.",

Time and time again Eggslut never fails with their amazing sandwiches. I ordered \"The slut\" and the \"Fairfax\", and I swear the Fairfax tasted better at the Las Vegas location over the La location.

I tried the slut- a coddled egg over potato puree with chives and their unappealing sounding \"grey salt\" served with crispy bread. It was delicious and simple- served artfully in a small glass jar with the bread beside it. It tastes like a perfectly runny yolk mixed with rich mashed potatoes- which really functions to complement the texture of the yolk. Delicious! We also tried the sausage breakfast sandwich. The brioche buns are perfectly golden and buttery, and the egg is of the ideal runny consistency- but it is just a breakfast sandwich.   Great spot for breakfast, but don't get tricked into waiting for an hour.",

So before heading to Sands, I *finally* stopped by (located the second floor of the Cosmo). As expected, there was a relatively long line but we got through the line in less than 15 minutes (though I always find it amusing that people who wait haven't decided by the time they're up at the register - they have two wall mounted menus before you make it to the register).   I made up my mind in the first 2 minutes - the Fairfax with turkey bacon and avocado, and accompanied by fresh OJ. The sandwich is solid, including scrambled eggs, chives, cheddar, and a slightly spicy sriracha mayo. Overall, the sandwich hit the spot and fueled my subsequent 25K steps at Sands and LVCC!   Look forward to stopping by again!",

Once you've paid there's still a good 15-20 min wait before the staff calls your name. I've had their gaucho, turkey sausage + egg, their slut and their cookie... all delicious! Next time I may have to get their biscuits, but I never have enough stomach space after the sandwich (ok I lied, I always walk over to milk bar and get the cereal milk soft serve right after...)! Price is relatively reasonable considering they're on the strip.",

We were staying at the Cosmo and the line was so long every time we walked by, that we ended up getting up early both days so we could be in line around 7am. It's a pretty inexpensive breakfast for eating on the strip and we were able to try both the sausage breakfast sandwich and the Fairfax + sausage. We also got a biscuit one day to share and we both really enjoyed that with the maple syrup.  My only complaint is that they use turkey sausage, great health wise but it always seemed to be a little dry. Also my husband wasn't a huge fan of the coffee, he said the roast was darker than he liked. We both loved the orange juice, and while $5 for 12 ounces of orange juice seems a little on the high side, I only wished they sold it in a larger cup!!",

A little pricey for simple sandwiches.  The line to pay was about a 10 min wait, to get the food it was another 30+.   I ordered the fairfax which has sriracha mayo & grilled onions. Didn't taste either. So much bread & not enough spread inside. I love grilled onions which is why I chose that over the slut but, meh, there weren't enough to make a difference. My husband is easily pleased by simple food. He didn't complain about his burger but didn't rave about it either. The bacon was good. The biscuit was good. Nothing special.   I think if this was less expensive and less of a hassle to order (they don't take call ahead orders either!) then maybe I would come again? I think a side of mayo & some salt packets could've maybe helped but i didn't want to go ask the poor girl at the counter. She was working so hard to get orders out while 30 people intensely stared at her.   Cute concept. Great menu. Just missed the mark.",

I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches and Eggslut basically has your slightly more glamorized version of your typical breakfast sandwiches. The line is usually long and there are only a few seats in the actual restaurant so we had to find some seats around the Cosmopolitan. There are only a few items on the menu but they do what they do well. I ordered the gaucho which is a $15 breakfast sandwich with wagyu beef. I opted to add turkey sausage for an extra $3. If I'm paying #18 for a sandwich it better be the best sandwich in the world. The egg was cooked perfectly. The wagyu beef was so juicy and tender. The arugula and chimichurri added a different texture and a nice contrast of taste. The flavors blended together really well. I love that they use a brioche bun for all their sandwiches - it definitely ups their game. If you don't want the bun, you can opt for a salad...but let's be real - who wants to eat salad for breakfast?",

The line went pretty quickly, and it's inside the Cosmo which is one of the higher end hotels on the strip. We ordered the Fairfax with bacon and the sandwich was good, even if it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The eggs are cooked really well and the bun is pillowy soft. Adding bacon was a good idea as it added a bit of needed saltiness with the creaminess of the eggs. I couldn't really taste the cheese, and we forgot all about the sriracha mayo and caramelized onions until the last few bites, where it all seemed to have gotten concentrated. All the prices are slightly higher than the LA locations, which isn't a dealbreaker but makes it difficult to justify a Fairfax with bacon and avocado for around $15.",

There were only two other customers in the facility. Very pleasant.   I decided to try the egg slut, even though I was very apprehensive at first. At first sight I thought they were kidding me after I sat down. It was delicious I had only one disappointment they didn't have Tabasco sauce. I do like almost every thing spicy.   Thanks for reading.",

Also, we tried to go by there at around 3pm in the afternoon on a Friday and they were all sold out of the Eggslut. About the Eggslut itself, we enjoyed it because we love mashed potatoes and runny eggs. You mix it up in the jar with the chives, and spread it on the toasted baguette slices, and it's a good breakfast to start your day. We also tried the Egg and Bacon sandwich, if you LOVE bacon and don't mind the pile of saltiness, then go for it. For some, there can be such a thing as too much bacon. We also tried the egg and sausage sandwich on our second trip, and that was more to my tasting -- but to each their own. There is limited seating, but I think the timing is just right between folks waiting for their order, and those rotating out when done eating. There's also the couches nearby (I think a part of the Chandelier lounge/bar?).",

I was waiting in line for about 25 minutes. Its not ridiculously bad but when your in vacation mode an all the time helps. Secondly, i think they should squeeze in a couple extra chairs as there is limited seating. But besides those two things this place is awesome!!! Definitely a must for a vegas newbie!",

There isn't a huge seating area either but sandwiches can be easily eaten on the go.   GAUCHO sandwich ($14) - my absolute favorite! The waygu tri-tip was so flavorful and seared to perfection with chimichurri sauce. The arugula, red onions, cage-free over medium egg and warm brioche bun complemented the entire sandwich. It's a tad bit small for the price, but I would definitely order it again!   SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE sandwich ($8) - pass. Just an average sandwich.   SLUT ($10) - pass. Served in a cute little glass bottle was potato puree with an egg on top and a few slices of baguette on the side. This was definitely NOT worth it and was my least favorite item. I felt like I could just make mashed potatoes and add an egg on top. I was told to mix the potato puree and egg together well before consuming. It did not taste unique, but was rather plain.   I am however, a huge fan of the GAUCHO sandwich and will only order that next time I come back (if the line isn't so darn long).",

The seating area was small and filthy, they should have somebody to clean up. I cannot imagine how bad it must be later in the day. Also, the food and drinks are really expensive: $8 for a small breakfast sandwich, $5 for a biscuit, and $5 for crummy coffee.    It was ok, I won't be back, and don't think I'll be visiting their Los Angeles location either.",

Since we were at the Cosmo (we'd just finish eating over at Secret Pizza), we decided to stop by.  I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheese for the 5 of us to share since we were so full. We all took 2+ bites, so it was a pretty large sandwich. It came out looking picture perfect for Instagram, so I was already skeptical of it's taste. Food that looks that good rarely tastes just as good. I was semi-correct. Although it was tasty, it was heavy and I'm not sure it was worth $8. You could get two Sausage McMuffins for less and feel just as satisfied.  Don't get me wrong -- it was good, but I don't think it's worth the wait at all. I mean, beezies at home are waiting an hour for a sandwich from here. Unless you're in the mood for breakfast, go to Secret Pizza.",

    "text": "First time I tried Eggslut was at the Los Angeles location. Their sandwiches just melt in your mouth. Everything is cooked just right. I like how the brioche bread is soft and buttered. I got really excited when I yelped restaurants in Las Vegas and saw Eggslut at the Cosmo.  I took my husband and kids there on a Tuesday close to noontime. The line was not as long as people say it is. We waited for at least 20 mins. Line was slow because there was only 1 girl working the register.  I don't know what was going on. I don't know how the orders go to the cooks. She was writing stuff a paper bag. I don't know how hard it is to take an order there. Their menu is so limited. I don't know if she was new. She just seemed like she didn't know what she was doing.  We got to the register and the girl switched places with another worker which was male. My husband clearly ordered 2 Fairfax sandwiches both with bacon and other stuff.  When they called our order, one of the sandwiches didn't have bacon.  My husband went back and told them there wasn't any bacon in it. The man behind the counter said that we ordered a double order of bacon on one of the Fairfax. Anyway they were nice enough to just put bacon in it.  For sure they messed up the order because they blast the music so loud there you need to yell out your order to the worker. Another complaint is that there are not too many tables or seats. Just one long table with 7-8 seats on both sides. Just be ready to stand neat. We got lucky and I had my kids sit to save us seats.  Other than that, I love that place and it's worth the wait.",

    "text": "DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!   Tiny portions!!! Expensive prices!   Visiting Vegas for the first time and relying on yelp brought me to this place.   I love a good breakfast/brunch place, being from the UK and visiting the US regularly, I always expect good food to be in large portions.. this place was not that!   We arrived at Egg slut around 11:30am, the line was huge, as expected..   I had already decided I was going to get 'the slut' as it was famous on the menu.. however during our wait in the line I noticed how small the portion size was as I looked at others eating.. I was shocked that this was nearly $15 and could be consumed by the average person in less than a minute... you get a little jar of eggs and a slice of bread on the side in a cardboard container... I was shocked and disappointed, and then decided to change my choice on the menu..   I ordered the sausage egg and cheese sandwich.. this was $12 I expected it to be a decent size.. however I was left disappointed when the food arrived.. it tasted good, but the size wasn't great.. I could have eaten at least 2 of these before being content..   Our total bill was $25 for two sandwiches.. stupidly expensive for a simple sandwich/batch/roll..  I seriously don't see this big hype..",

Worst customer service ever, they treated everyone with contempt.  It seems like either they don't get paid enough or something else is going on.  Besides the service being bad, the gaucho sandwich just tastes like something is missing because when you bite into it the Tri tip is so dry and it needs some kind of sauce or tomato to lubricate it.",

My slut must have been made by a mad person cuz it was hella salty!!! (see what I did there Lol)  The reason I gave 3 stars is cuz they really need to hire a cleaner. People are nasty and I get tourists are lazy and on vaca but its a mess. They have counter seating and its all sticky n gross. There's jars all over cuz people don't know if they should return it or throw it away so they just leave em.",

Let's start with accessibility. Easy to get there, and easy parking at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the strip, so take 15 and you're there!  I ordered the Gaucho sandwich. For $14, you basically get a rather small but pretty good sandwich. The menu there is unfortunately rather limited with only a very few other options. There are basically only 8 main options in total which is very little...  I would say that this is a pretty good place, but I would advise you to go only if you are already in the area and really craving some rather simple breakfast sandwiches. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

Thank the lord I did not have to wait on a huge line. We hit up the joint around noon and was able to get a seat at the table while waiting for our food. The food came out pretty quick.  One strange/awkward thing I wanted to mention. After placing my order and paying the receipt gives an option for tip. Now this place is not a sit down and get served restaurant. It's a self service place... you pay then pick-up your food when they call your name. I always feel so awkward then these type of places ask for  tip because you're put in the spot. To be honest you don't need to give any kind of extra tip here.  The menu is semi-limited in options but still have great choices. I tried the sausage, egg & cheese sandwich (substituted the mustard aioli for the chipotle ketchup). The sandwich was huge and delicious. It kind of reminded me of a McDonald breakfast sausage sandwich but way bigger and a bit healthier. Haha no shade.  The sandwiches here are comparable to the egg shop in NYC. We did not get a drink because the juice and coffee were $5. So cray.  I highly recommend the sandwiches for breakfast or lunch. So delicious and will fill you up.",

Until now. It was bomb.   The line didn't look that long initially but ended up taking ~25 mins. There is also very limited seating and every single napkin dispenser in the restaurant was empty. The sandwiches are messy so this was extremely inconvenient. People were running wild with hands covered in egg yolk. Not cute or sanitary.",

The taste of the Wagyu with everything else was just so perfect. This burger also felt healthy and the bun didn't feel too dense, the food did not have a heavy greasy feeling. Everything felt so balanced and amazing. Highly recommend.",

My Auntie who is over 80 years old refused to eat there because the menu was so simple, however the prices were outrageous.  Bacon, Egg & Cheese Sandwich $8.75. Or Sausage, Egg Cheese Sandwich $8.75.  Slut Specialty...eggs on top of homemade potatoes in a glass jar with chives served on banquet $10.75 Hubby ordered the cheeseburger with bacon. Angus beef, sunny side up egg, carmalized onions, pickles, cheddar cheese & dijonnaise on a brioche Bun. $10.75. Add bacon was $3.00 for 3pcs I had the same without the bread and bacon. I had to ask for cutlery and napkins. They don't give you anything that you don't ask for. It was packed. The line was out and around the corner when we got in it. It stayed that way the entire time we were there. It's really booming.  Try it but it's not a cheap it. You're in Vegas tho,",

Cosmo has done a great job bringing in great dining options representative of spots across the country- Eggslut (from LA) is known for their breakfast sandwiches and oozy eggs. Expect a 10-20 minute line to place your order, but good comes out pretty quick and you'll down it fast.  I've come by a handful of times and the consistency is a bit off. I know they're busy and working fast, but the eggs have been cooked over hard on half of my sandwiches, which is a bummer. On the bright side, despite the high prices (just under $10 with tax), they're not stingy with toppings- my bacon, egg, and cheese is usually stuffed with several strips of bacon, and friends have reported the same results when adding ($3) it to the Fairfax.",

What's been awesome to see that Eggslut has grown to multiple Los Angeles locations, Vegas and also in Beruit! Great to see them grow cause it's delicious  So when I knew I can get an eggslut sandwich, I was so excited. One of my go too's is the Turkey sausage egg and cheese. Something about that Turkey sausage that I absolutely love! I heard they make the sausage in house and they blend it with some great flavors that I can really explain, but trust me it's some of the best sausage I've ever had. Man of the sandwichs are on a brioche bun which is always soft and compliments the breakfast sandwich. They add a nice mayo with mustard seed to give a little pop to the sandwich with a perfectly cooked egg that oozes out yoke everywhere. Add the nice cheddar cheese to it, perfection!!   I didn't order it this time around but they also have biscuits that you can substitute the brioche bun. Now those biscuits take the sandwich to a whole new level. Nice flaky biscuit that tastes just like they are fresh baked. Love them!!   Anytime you want a delicious breakfast sandwich while at the Cosmopolitan, Eggslut is the place to to. Soooooo good!!",

It was nice as a light snack, but not what I would call breakfast. I chased it with their cold brew, which was perfect black! Just sweet enough but not bitter- that I also wish came in more than a small (Starbucks at my hotel wasn't cutting it for me). There is plenty of seating all around and the menu is pretty small (you'd hope the line would go fast), but it was delicious. Next time I would probably order the same and add a sandwich (what?

Hours of operation vary like 7AM to 7PM or midnight to 7PM so check before you go!   This is the 'slut' - a coddled egg over potato puree garnished with chives and gray salt. It was served with slices of toasted baguette. I ordered this to go and wasn't how they were going to package my coddled egg but it came in a cute jar that you get to keep!  The potato puree was so smooth and tasty as you mix in the yolk of that coddled egg. All you need to do is dip your toast in all that deliciousness! So simple but so perfect! It was pricey for $10.50 but it was a great late night snack. Other people I'm sure agree because usually there's a line all around the corner to the bathroom! You can peer right into the kitchen and see them make everything fresh. The coddled eggs are all sitting in their sous vide bath ready to go!   Pro foodie tip:  If you are waiting you have time to drop by Milk Bar grab a few cookies and crack pie to go!   I would come back and try other menu items. My brothers tried their sausage egg and cheese sandwich for $8.50 and was pretty happy with that! Go at opening aka midnight to avoid those long lines!",

Sure, the line may wrap around the corner but it moves pretty quickly since there are only a handful of options on the menu. With a simple menu, it makes ordering a breeze.  I've been to the LA location at Grand Central Market and this location isn't the same. But I mean, who doesn't love all-day breakfast? It's funny how the sandwiches are so simple, yet people are willing to pay $9 for a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. And I'm one of those people!   The bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is a staple at Eggslut and I believe the warm brioche bun makes the sandwich what it is. The bacon strips are crispy but I wish the cheese was melted in the sandwich a little better. The cheese was barely melted and felt like an afterthought. The yolk on my egg was not runny at all, which leads me to believe the egg was overcooked.   I've had better experiences at Eggslut. Not sure if it was the chef that day but my sandwich wasn't what I remembered!",

Trekked here on a weekend morning and was faced with the infamous line wrapped around the corner and stretching down the hall. Yelp assured me the line moves quickly, and I'm pretty singleminded, so I got in line while my boyfriend ran off to get a coffee.   The line was long, but did indeed move pretty fast - we got to the front in about 30-40 minutes. I ordered the Fairfax sandwich with bacon, the slut, and biscuit with honey butter. The biscuit can be skipped, but the sandwich and slut were some of the best things I had in Vegas that weekend.   So yum!",

We were a little concerned about the line, we were staying in the Cosmopolitan and took the elevator down to grab a sandwich and the line was wrapped around the corner and down the hallway. Good news, it moved much faster than expected!   Sandwiches were delicious. Crispy bacon, perfectly cooked egg, melted cheese, toasted bun and just enough brightness from the chipotle ketchup to keep it from being too rich.  Hoping to get downstairs early tomorrow to try the homemade biscuits, which are only available while they last, and the namesake slut is on my menu for tomorrow!",

They are known for their egg sandwiches. Why? Their eggs with a hint of chive are just so fluffy!  I got the Fairfax breakfast sandwich and the Slut. The Fairfax breakfast sandwich was worth the long line. I added bacon to mine and it was an adventure for my taste buds. The eggs and chives, sweet caramelized onions, sriracha mayo and bacon was an awesome start o my day.  The Slut tasted unexpected, its simply egg on top of mashed potatoes. Although it looks fancy, I didn't see it as anything special. The break that you dip into the jar is crispy. Meh, wouldn't get this again. tasted like baby-food because the mashed potatoes were pureed.  Over all a good experience because the line was efficient and that egg sandwich was out of this world.  Solid 4 start from me!",

We fell in love with Eggslut at the original location in Los Angeles, and are happy to say we weren't disappointed with their Vegas location.  We came early on a Saturday morning, and waited about 15 minutes in line.  The Fairfax was just as amazing as I remembered in LA- soft scrambled eggs with chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and sriracha mayo within a brioche bun.  SO freaking good (so good that I've been Youtubing copy cat recipes all day)!  The eggs are so buttery and smooth, and I love how the sweetness of the onion balances with the sriracha mayo.  My brother recently visited Vegas, and said the Fairfax sandwich was the best meal he had while on his trip.  Order the Fairfax- you won't regret it!",

The biscuit was crisp on the outside and dense and soft on the inside. It went well with the honey butter. The Slut was delicious and stayed hot the entire time while eating. I ran over to District (the donut place) to get coffee while waiting in line. They definitely have their egg dishes perfected.

One person is cooking the eggs, one cooking that beef, one cooking the beef patties and one assembling the sandwiches in groups.   Fresh orange juice was refreshing. The sandwiches were very tasty. The bun was soft. You cannot go wrong with bacon, egg and cheese or egg salad and greens. Overall, great combination of bun and filling - an upgrade from the usual fast food breakfast items.",

They never even attempted to let me know that it was ready. I had to ask them if it was ready. By the time I got my sandwich, it was lukewarm...  Good food. Bad customer service...

    "text": "Ugh.  What was I thinking?  How could I not pick up that Slut?  Besides the fact that it's their signature item (which is reason enough on its own), I can't help but think of all of the different lines/jokes I could've used in my review...  \"I saw this hot looking Slut in Vegas\" \"This (food) whore picked up a Slut at Cosmo\" \"For breakfast, I ate this Sl-...\"  Okay, you get the picture.  With a name like that, the jokes practically write themselves!  All of that having been said though, my thought process actually made perfect sense at the time - the Slut alone wasn't going to satisfy my wants (ha!), but I wasn't hungry enough to get that and something else.  Plus, I'd be lying if I said it was the most appealing dish on their menu; all of their sandwiches, as well as their cheeseburger, sounded so much better!  After waffling back and forth on which of their breakfast sandwiches to get, I ultimately decided to go with their SAUSAGE, EGG & CHEESE SANDWICH ($8.95).  Filled with a House-made Turkey Sausage, Cage-free Over Medium Egg, Cheddar Cheese, and Honey Mustard Aioli on a Brioche Bun, this thing looked and smelled so good, I started to salivate (my photo doesn't do it justice) - <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggslut-las-vegas?select=JdSBqc90mbOWGr0o67mubQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eggs...</a>  Unsurprisingly, given their specialty, I thought the egg in the sandwich was great - pillowy and perfectly cooked.  Both the cheese (yum!) and sausage (meaty, juicy) were pretty good as well, but I personally would've preferred a pork sausage patty.  As for the bu n, it was both good and bad.  While I liked how it tasted and how airy/soft it was, I feel like its buttery/greasy texture gave it a weird mouthfeel.  Either that or I'm just too used to the English muffins that Starbucks and McDonald's use).  Since I've never been to any of their locations in SoCal, I can't say how this one compares in regards to size, taste/quality of food, or prices (though I imagine it's a bit pricier here).   However, even though I wasn't quite as mesmerized as I had hoped I would be, I'm still stoked to have finally tried Eggslut and would definitely come back.  Maybe not when the line stretches to a 30-45 min wait, but 15-20?  That's not so bad to walk out with that Slut everyone talks about.",

    "text": "I'm not what you would call a hearty breakfast person so I appreciate a place that serves something on the smaller side.   I've been to this location as well as the one in the Grand Central Market in LA a handful of times. This store is found on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan surrounded by other eateries and dessert shops.  Expect a very long line in the morning. On weekdays it's conference attendees trying to get food before their sessions begin and on weekends the line is full of tourists. It's a solid 30 minutes usually between the end of the line and when you get to the register. On nearly all of my visits to this place there's only been one cashier helping folks even though there are a total of two registers. I've found that surprising considering the volume of people. The food comes out quickly though and there's usually seating to be found either at one of the tables within the shop or just outside.  I've always gotten The Slut which is a cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato puree, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette. The bread is for dipping or you can just layer the egg and potato puree on each slice like a spread. Either way three slices of bread is not enough so we run out and have to eat the rest right out of the jar with a spoon. The Slut runs $10.50 at this location.  They also have coffees and fresh-squeezed orange juice which runs another $5. It's ridiculous pricing but it's Vegas so it's to be expected.  Nonetheless the portion is just right and the food is great so I always make it a point to visit when I can stomach the line (pun intended).",

Problem is, I'm giving them 5 stars just like a 1000 other people have done before me, and that's not going to make their line up any shorter. It isn't going to give them any incentive to try to change things either, cos their business is thriving.  I hope they will find a way to serve people faster. The food was good.

I came here pretty early on a Sunday morning, and wait was probably like 20 minutes. I can imagine the lines would get really long just a few hours later though. There are other options in the area though where you can get a cup of coffee while your party waits in the line.   They have a lot of choices of breakfast items, but I have always gone for the bacon egg sandwich. It come with a toasty bun, good chunk of bacon, and a runny egg, drizzled with cheese in between. The best part of this sandwich is the runny egg, because who doesn't love that yummy gooiness. It's also very convenient that the sandwich come in this neat packaging to hold in all that yolk. I try not waste any, but it happens. If the occasion arises to come eat here again, I would, but I don't know if it is worth waiting up to 40 minutes.",

    "text": "So, there has always been a hype about this place from all my friends. I decided to determine if Eggslut met the expectations of this hype. Unfortunately, I will have to say that Eggslut fell short of the expectations. To be honest, it is an over-priced egg-focused venue. If you are looking for a breakfast sandwich or something unique, you do not have to go here. You are not missing out. For more details, read on...  Venue/Atmosphere: So let's start with...this venue is located in the Cosmopolitan as a quick grab and go. So you order and then find a seat near by and much. There is not much to share because you are literally just eating and going. I will say that there are some seat around the establishment, but those seats can get filled quickly. In addition, it's a given, but it's loud. Expect to have loud conversations as you are only a level above the casino and hustle and bustle.   Service/Staff: Nothing to spectacular. The staff was kind and welcoming, but nothing out of the ordinary from what you expect out of a grab & go establishment.   Food: My overall though tis that the food is over-priced, but what food isn't in Las Vegas. My family and I ordered the following: the Fairfax, the Slut, and the Sausage, Egg, & Cheese. I will say all of the sandwiches were very basic. Nothing too special about them. As for the Slut, that was unique. But I feel that it is over-priced and can be done at home. It was basically a small jar of mashed potatoes with an egg on top.   Overall, I would say that there is nothing extraordinarily special about this venue. I would recommend spending your money somewhere else. Do it for the \"gram\" if you want, but it is not a \"must-try\" in my books.",

Took a beautiful tour of the hotel (since I've never been here in order) to find this place... after getting my food to go... I realized that I should've taken the escalator up from the casino... hahaha ANYWAYS, upon arrival, there was a line that pooped around the hall. Looks may be deceiving, it seems long going around and down the hall... but, the register is at the turn of the corner. So in reality the wait is not too bad. Possibly 10 minutes to order.  It was 9:30 and I had big plans of exploration for the day. So, I only ordered the slut. And my goodness... it was heavenly! If you like potatoes, you'll love the butter puree! I do wish I had more baguette slices that were less toasty. I like my bread a little on the soft side when using as a dipper... you may think the little glass jar wouldn't be filling, but it sure is!  I ordered their OJ. And it tasted freshly squeezed. It was quite refreshing & just enough to enjoy with my meal. I suggest eating there so you can easily recycle the jar in their bin. And because there really isn't any outdoor seating around the strip to sit, snack, and people watch... But, seating in the food court seemed limit as it was a packed house.  I'm definitely coming here again! ***Visited on Tuesday, April 16th, 2019",

I've tried their bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and fairfax sandwich. I was not impressed with the bacon, egg and cheese, but the fairfax (with added bacon) was absolutely AMAZING. It is hands down, my #1 recommendation! Their cage-free eggs were scrambled to perfection - incredibly soft and super fluffy. Their sriracha mayo complemented the sandwich very well and added a great depth of flavor. I also loved their warm brioche bun!   The long lines are there for a reason.

We came at 11:30 AM and waited in line until 12:15. We ordered and had our food in hand by 1230. The wait is pleasant, you're able to watch the chefs cook.  We tried a number of items -  Slut - Creamy, Rich, tasty. Served in a jar it comes with a couple of pieces of toasted French baguette. Not ideal to carry out because it's messy but not to be missed.  Gaucho - Really good. The steak was cooked really well. The chimichurri sauce was an excellent complement. The egg was perfectly done and broke as soon as you bit into it. The bread was fluffy and Rich.  Fairfax - A little spicy but nothing crazy. Scrambled eggs with spicy sauce cheese and arugula.   Egg, Cheese and Sausage - really good in a croissant bun. Very bht  Egg and Cheese with Spicy Ketchup - even my picky sister who wasn't hungry demolished it.",

I had to try their namesake entree, The Slut.  Just with a name like that, it's just demanding to be ordered!  So I ordered that and also had The Gaucho since many of my yelp buddies have had it and praised it.  The Slut -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2inO9e0&s=609b28c044e577a768fa27c221271c318c569ab634ab3dc57e4b7c1fdf69312e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2inO9e0</a> A coddled egg on top of smooth potato puree, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette It's like a glorified mashed potato.  I love that it's served piping hot.  To eat it, you have to breakdown the egg and fold it into the potato puree.  It's a playful entree and delicious as well!  The Gaucho -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2inOcqc&s=a4772b16daa383710879d40a8e45f732597f4c634f640a8fc2990c42468441a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2inOcqc</a> Seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg in a warm brioche bun The Gaucho is a great breakfast sandwich, probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a generous amount of beef and the runny egg made it all heavenly..  Unfortunately I couldn't get a decent pic of the egg since it had already broken down and ran all over the sandwich by the time I brought it to my counter.  Still an awesome egg sandwich!  The weekend hours are what make this place desirable especially for the late night clubbing crowd.  12am to 7pm.  I've only been here in the middle of the week in the morning and it was pretty busy, so I can only imagine how insanely long the line can be on the weekends.  Overall, Eggslut is a great dining addition to the Cosmopolitan and the Strip in general.  You can pretty much go here at any time of the day to get your egg fix in an elevated form.",

We came with 9 people and they have very limited seating, so you may want to opt to have one member of your group save seats.

You will almost always find a long line, but my friends and I came at 5am after leaving the club so we had almost no wait. The cashier was friendly but the chef seemed overwhelmed, so I can only image how it is when there is a long line.  As for the food, I just felt that it was average. The menu is rather small and simplified. I went with the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. It consists of exactly what it says, plus chipotle katchup. The bun was large and fluffy but seemed to almost dry out quickly as I ate it. The bacon was thick and great quality but overall the sandwich was just basic. I got bored halfway through and gave the rest away, and I never waste food. I also had a bite of the Fairfax which consists of scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and Sriracha mayo. This was more interesting to me, so I suggest maybe going with something other than the basic sandwich. I think I just expected a lot more since it is so hyped up but didn't feel that it was super innovative or tasty.",

    "text": "My first encounter with Eggslut was in Grand Central Market in DTLA, and since then I've been waiting for a chance to try it again. Tip: If you don't want to wait long, just come early. Otherwise, since they cook pretty much everything to order, you'll have to wait upwards to 45 minutes. That's just a product of being popular and cooking things a la minute.   We got there an hour after opening, so it was about a 30 minute wait. The line goes all the way back into this back corridor next to the restaurant, and you have to be careful not to get in the way of the line cooks using that corridor for transporting ingredients back and forth from storage and the kitchen.  The two things we got: - Fairfax with turkey sausage: The turkey sausage had a bit of spice that I really liked along with the sriracha mayo, and the eggs were just the right consistency and saltiness.  - Cheeseburger with over medium egg: This was my favorite of the two, since I really liked the fattiness and meatiness of the burger. The pickles really helped cut through that fattiness though, and the caramelized onions were great.  As we were getting our stuff to go, I did appreciate that the egg was cooked over medium, so that the yolk wouldn't get too messy. That being said, I usually prefer the runny yolk with a burger.  In all, it's a very solid sandwich. I personally would have liked the brioche bun to have a little more density and chew to counteract the softness of the eggs/meat, or at least a bit more of a crunch texture. The service is very friendly, and they make sure to get your order right. Prices are easily expensive for a breakfast sandwich, but the quality of ingredients is good, and they are big enough to fill you up.  In all, I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for this. They're very good, but just come early and beat the rush if you really feel like you need to try it.",

It's a small place, but you can find seating within the Cosmopolitan.  The girl handing out the orders looked like she really didn't want to be there, but I ignored that and focused on the food.    I highly recommend the Fairfax ($8).  It's scrambled eggs, carmelized onions, cheddar, chives and sriracha mayo sandwiched in a soft brioche bun.  I added bacon ($3) and avocado ($2), which was pricey but made it extra delicious.  The ingredients were good quality and the sriracha mayo added the right amount of spice.   My only gripe is that they charge $5 for a can of Sprite!  That's a ridiculous mark up and I still had to ask for a cup of ice.  Bring your own beverage and just get the food here.  I lied... one other gripe is that they don't serve hash browns or fries.  I missed having my starchy side.  They are a pretty well-oiled machine and you can see the sandwiches being put together in an assembly line.  However, my bf ordered the cheeseburger and they oddly forgot the meat patty.  Luckily we didn't go far before noticing and they remade it right away.    Overall, I would come back here when I'm craving a simple tasty breakfast.",

Totallh worth the wait and the price especially if you love eggs and breakfast.  I love biting into the sandwich and having the egg yolk break and soak into your bun.  The bun is key and what does it.  It's like a fresh baked buttery croissant except without the flakiness.  The ratio of all the components is just right.  You get all the goodness of a plate of breakfast in each bite.  Not too greasy, fresh ingredients.  Their menu is simple like in-n-out.  Its just different kinds egg based of sandwiches.  Seating sucked for us on a Sunday afternoon. You have to do that lingering stalking method where you wait around for someone to leave then dive for their table lol. This is not the place to meet a group of ppl for brunch.  Still a good unique eggbased sandwich.  Can't get anything like this anywhere else so I would suffer the long wait again.",

I can tell this is an LA based dream put together because there are a billion places to get these sandwiches on the other coast and you can get two for the cost of one here. With that knowledge and great appreciation of my delis, bodegas, and bagel stores I dunno if I'm an eggslut myself.   Really the \"slut\" itself (a soft egg within cheesy grits) is delicious. But would I rave over this and crave it? Would I come and wait in a huge ass line for this? But I suppose I'd rather have biscuits and gravy at 3am and not some farm to table sourced eggs cuz I'm about comfort after drinking not class.  Eggs are so damn cheap and easy to make so I'm not super impressed overall. One of the few. Stay strong eggslut cuz your Vegas peeps love you! Also doesn't hurt to eat this around the beautiful chandelier at the cosmo...",

Egg Slut has exciting, saucy egg sandwiches, multi-layered omelettes, all right outside Marquee. Great for diabetes patients drinking beers all night - Eggs, protein, whole wheat buns fresh after grilled with the omelette sandwiches. Near the jewelry boutique, elevator and escalator, Egg Slut is also the perfect place to meet with your party since friends disappear by getting lost in the enormous Cosmo as well as Marquee each night. Individuals wake up with strange lovers with no memory each hour in Las Vegas. Good to know you have a safe place to rendezvous - Make the meeting spot Egg Slut outside Marquee.

I was greeted by a delightfully happy cashier who took my order. I had intentions to order their signature \"slut\" dish consisting of cage-free coddled egg and potato puree, poached in this adorable glass jar served with a side of baguette slices. However I was pulled into the sight of a fresh brioche buns being toasted. So I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with a cold brew coffee. The wait was rather short for an opening of a restaurant. And the quality and presentation did not suffer. Once I bit into the yummy looking sandwich, both my sense of vision and taste came to agreement. This sandwich was satisfying without leaving you with that heavy carb/breakfast sandwich feeling. I could eat 3 more of these! The sandwich itself is wrapped in what appears to be recycled parchment paper? And then cradled in a paper pocket. You may find yourself licking the paper once your done. I may or may not have, ha ha. The only underwhelming component was the 5 dollar cold brew coffee size. I'm not generally a coffee person but if you are, you may feel discouraged at the site of the cup size. But you're not going to go here for the coffee. You're going to go for the yummy delicious food. Next time I may try their signature slut dish or if later in the day I may feel inspired to try ground angus beef cheeseburger with cage-free over medium egg. That brioche bun is addicting! Definitely a place everyone needs to stop by and order from! Your stomach and taste buds will thank you!",

They took payment quickly and as we waited at least 15 minutes for essentially an egg sandwich we realized the tables were all filthy. They were covered with grease marks, crumbs, salt, crumpled napkins. The young help stayed behind the counter chatting with each other. No one to clean tables in that crew. Also they don't give tap water, only small bottled water for $5 a hit. When we finally got our sandwiches they were falling apart out of the little bags (further explaining the general pigginess of the place). We've eaten in many fast food places from McDonalds to lesser knowns and many in between and we are truly surprised that a health authority doesn't shut this disgusting place down until they clean up their act. Worst food place we've ever seen in Vegas.",

I just feel like it's almost out of place in Vegas. The eggslut in Cali is so perfect. It's in the beautiful outdoor space in the grand central market. You can get a sandwich and eat it on the counters with the breeze hitting your face. You feel relaxed and can enjoy the simplicity of your sandwich. The Vegas eggslut location is in the cosmopolitan hotel. There's not enough seating. There's a loud ruckus. The environment is way to hustle and bustle for you to truly enjoy the simple sandwich known as egg sandwiches.   I would order the fairfax. It's loaded with cheese and eggs of course. Add the bacon and avocado  for only a few bucks more. I would also recommend their slut. It's a bit awkward to order, but it's a great addition to your breakfast. I will have to warn you that it is a bit salty so make sure you leave some bread from your sandwich to use as extra dipping bread.   I would not order their egg salad! It was bland and super dry. I give their egg salad a 1 out of 5 stars.",

SETTING/SERVICE: Menu is simple and easy to read! Limited seating but people come and go frequently so seats open up quick! It's a little pricey for the size of the food, but it's perfect in terms of filling you up and taste!!! The staff is super friendly and the playlist is fire!!!  FOOD: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! The Fairfax is my absolute favorite, the Sriracha Mayo makes the sandwich amazing! The Slut is also their special and it is delicious!!! *hint* everyone recommends the OJ and it is fresh squeezed and delicious! Try it!   OVERALL: A+ Eggslut is amazing and the food is spectacular!  I'm obsessed with this place and plan on coming here as much as I can every time I'm in Vegas!!",

    "text": "As an avid Vegas traveler, it can be very difficult to find an affordable food spot within the Cosmopolitan hotel because things can be either way too pricey or too far of a walk (I get lazy, ok??). Eggslut opening up is probably one of the best things that ever happened to the entire city of Las Vegas.  The line varies depending on what hour you get to the restaurant but overall, the line moves fairly fast. The menu offers a selection of sandwiches and other breakfast items at a price that's definitely competitive with other restaurants in/around the hotel. My regular order would be the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich - add avocado and ask for scrambled egg instead of sunny-side up...it's PERFECT.   There is extremely limited seating space so don't expect to always find a seat so easily. It would be best to find a seating area within the hotel or bring it up to your room if seating is too crowded.",

The line to get food was pretty long even though it was 6am you would think that it wouldnt be that busy. I wished they had French fries or something they didn't have anything to go with the burger which was kind of a disappointment I feel like when you order a burger you need fries too. If I ever go back to the cosmopolitan I will definitely have to eat here again it was well worth the wait.",

The breakfast sandwiches here were the most fresh tasting that I've had. It amazes me how they made something so simple taste so good!   I've had both the Applewood Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwich and the Turkey Sausage sandwich with a side of freshly squeezed orange juice. Both sandwiches were very good but I prefer the Applewood bacon over the turkey sausage. (My girlfriend tried to steal my sandwich!) I've honestly thought all breakfast sandwiches with bacon tasted the same until I tried the one that Eggslut has to offer. Eggslut will definitely be a mandatory breakfast  stop for me everytime I go to Vegas now. I look forward to trying all of the other items this place has to offer!  Something worth mentioning is that there isn't a lot of seating at the establishment so you will have to find some place to settle down and eat at the casino if you are wanting to eat your food right away versus taking it back up to your room. (I recommend that you eat it right away while it's hot)",

The slut = loose morals and high (on flavor!). Definitely try this and ask for extra bread (it's free).  Sandwiches in order of my favorite to least (although all are really good): 1. Fairfax (add bacon). The best! 2. Bacon egg and cheese  3.  Sausage egg and cheese (the honeymustard aioli though!) 4. Gaucho  5. Cheeseburger",

Please have your order ready when you get to the counter - the main reason the line seems to take so long is that people (despite having been in line so long with access to the menu), still don't know what they want when they get to the counter.   We had a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich and a gaucho. Both very, very good. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used. Also had a coffee and an orange juice. My husband says that the coffee was great and strong, while I did not care for the orange juice- had a weird taste to me.   A little pricey, but understandable considering the ingredients and the location. Would come again.",

    "text": "After a long Vegas weekend (you know, you've been there too...) we were looking for a place to grab a bite before the long road back to San Diego. It dawned on me that a lot of people come here for breakfast/brunch/food in general so I suggested here!  The line is long, read the rest of the reviews, they'll all tell you. We ended up waiting about a half hour but I would say it was worth the wait! Next time, drop someone off at the Cosmopolitan and have them stand in line while you go park the car in their lot. I recommend walking if you can? If you're not in and out of that lot in an hour you'll have to pay $7.   After a grueling wait after a night of drinking and other festivities these sandwiches are exactly what you need. I ended up getting two sandwiches: The Fairfax with bacon and the sausage, egg, and cheese and it was my first step on the road to hangover recovery. I loved the Fairfax the best. Light, creamy scrambled eggs and smoky bacon with a little spicy kick from the sriracha mayo was the best thing I could have. The sausage, egg, and cheese also didn't disappoint but the sausage was a little herby and it got a little messy because of the runny egg, but who doesn't LOVE a runny egg?  I would say it's worth the wait! Next time I'm back in Vegas I'll be back here to try their signature slut out and maybe a biscuit!",

The eggs are cooked to perfection as expected, but the burger patties and buns were very mediocre/almost too dry. Most importantly, I was still hungry after finishing a full $10-15 burger, and I'm just a petite 5'2\" girl with a regular healthy appetite.

    "text": "After salivating about this place for at least 2 months we finally made it to Vegas to try it out. We walked right into the Cosmopolitan Resort and made our way up the escalator to Eggslut. Worried about a long line, we arrived early, like 8 am. It can be deceiving because you think the line is short at first then you walk around the corner and the line could be all the way back the hallway. Lucky for us it was relatively short. We waited maybe 10 minutes to order a Slut and a Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich. The Slut is what I've been waiting for and it didn't disappoint with its creamy perfectly seasoned potato puree and just gooey enough coddled egg topped with gray salt and chives. I thought I was in Heaven. The toasted baguettes added enough crunch to make this a perfect combination. The hubs got the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Sandwich and I had a couple of bites. The Chipotle Ketchup added a little kick to the just crispy enough bacon and egg and made this sandwich a winner, winner. I've read reviews where it's not worth the wait but for us we would've waited at the end of the long line at the end of the hall for this breakfast duo that made our trip!! Thanks Eggslut, we'll be back someday!!",

    "text": "How convenient was it that it was right there when I left Marquee Dayclub one afternoon. The name sounded familiar and my friend told me about their fame in the West Coast. Right! Now I remember. My friend and I caught the lines at a decent time, less than 10 people in line. Win! We heard that the lines get crazy at all hours. The menu was selective and prices were decent for most items. I was not knowledgeable about the food Eggslut had to offer but my friend guided me into having one of their specialties, the Slut. I wanted a salad but arugula was not my preference. For $10, you get an egg coddled in a small jar on top of potato puree. Just think of a small lightly cooked egg over mashed potatoes with enough salt and some chives served with three thin slices of baguette. Ask for extra baguette slices. Yes, delicious. No, not worth it nor was it filling. The wait for the food was longer than me devouring it in less 5 minutes.",

I ordered the fairfax sandwich without any add-ons. The wait for the food was not long, however, there was no open seating available. I found some couches not too far away but it made it tough to eat since it got a little messy with the eggs falling out. Nevertheless, the taste was absolutely divine! The eggs were so fluffy they melted in my mouth! It was undeniably delicious and I had to make another trip prior to my departure from Vegas. The second visit I made was in the morning for breakfast and the line was huge! But.. I waited and this time I ordered a fairfax sandwich with turkey sausage (+2 or 3$). I will be honest, I liked the sandwich a lot more without the turkey sausage because the meat killed the taste of the eggs for me. I could no longer sense the fluffy texture of scrambled eggs I did my first time. I recommend everyone to give this place a try. Some tips: don't go in the morning unless you want to wait in a long line and try the fairfax sandwich - without any add ons!",

Today, I went back to get Gaucho but they still run out. I start to wonder if they did serve this sandwich. However, I ordered Egg Salad, Sausage Egg and Cheese sandwiches and both turned out not that good. Special Sausage Egg and Cheese tastes like the one you can get from McDonald's,besides bread has better quality. However, I will stick to Fairfax.",

I took all out-of-town visitors to said truck for them to have THE BEST breakfast sandwich they've ever had in their lives (The Fairfax)  Fast forward to Eggslut being sold, the truck shutting down, and a brick and mortar opening in Grand Central Market. I tried it multiple times and was disappointed every time. It was not the same at all.  Now fast forward, I'm in Vegas with husband and friends and we need food, bad! Eggslut is next door at the Cosmo and we all want it. I'm starving, I don't expect it to be as delicious as the original truck, I just want it bad.  We wait in line, sure, it was nearly noon after all. All the hungover Vegas people are just getting up after all. We waited 20 minutes or less for everything, no biggie. They were out of sausage, which made the girls in front of me quite upset. But I'm vegetarian, so I was fine. I knew what I was there for - The Fairfax, with avocado and a cold brew.  I'm losing one star because they forgot the avocado. Otherwise, maybe it's been so many years since I've had the original truck that I've forgotten the exact flavor and texture, maybe I was really hungry and a little hungover....But no, I believe that the Vegas location of Eggslut is nearly as good as the original food truck. Bravo Vegas, you got something right!",

On a recent trip to Vegas, we decided to go to Eggslut in The Cosmopolitan at around 8 am (very early for Las Vegas, yes!)... and magically there was no line.  Stepped right up, ordered... it was quick and delicious.  I love that their eggs are cage-free.  I'm not even a huge egg sandwich type fan, but the one I got (bacon, egg & cheese) was literally the best breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten.  The brioche bun was super soft and flavorable, the hardwood smoked bacon was perfectly crispy, egg expertly done, and the chipotle ketchup (which didn't sound great to me at first) was amazingly tangy.  It all worked so well together.  I totally understand why there's usually a line out the store here.  It's well worth it... and downright cheap and inexpensive by Vegas standards.  I'm going back for sure.",

    "text": "Saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. This place does not have a lot of seating so if you have a big party it is best to take it to go. The line can get long pretty fast. Their sandwiches are pretty good. I ordered the Fairfax and egg salad sandwich. Make use of the fork. The Fairfax is creamy and can get messy. (If you take out the sandwich the egg will spill out). The arugula goes well with the egg salad. I think this a 1 place you should try if you're in vegas.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor in the Cosmopolitan next to Momofuku. For the past year or so since they have opened, I've been coming here at least once every Vegas trip (about 4-5 times a year). My friends have been raving about the ones in LA, but unfortunately I don't go to LA as often as I go to Vegas. Eggslut has a line pretty early in the morning. Like most people, I consider anything before 9am in Vegas as early.  So the amount of egg, or in this instance I'm just gonna call it \"slut\", the amount slut you get isn't that much for the price you pay, but it tastes so damn good.  I probably couldn't eat 2 whole sluts for breakfast, but I'm not completely satisfied with one. Not sure if the prices are cheaper in LA, but the reason I only give the 4 star is mostly for the pricing. Apparently sluts are also recycled here! Not even sure what that really means.... I do plan to try and make it out here at least once every trip to Vegas!  P.S. I apologize for calling their sandwiches, \"sluts\".",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally try Eggslut. I live in Los Angeles and there is a location there as well that is close to my work. I have heard incredible things about it from people who I work with. Although, I never got a chance to try EggSlut in LA - I was definitely very excited to try it the next morning while me and my fiance were staying at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. We were looking to grab something on the go. We stopped at Va Bene (review below) for coffee and then we headed to Eggslut to brave the line for some to-go sandwiches. Every time I ever passed EggSlut, no matter if it was morning noon or late night, there was always a line wrapped around the place. Probably the reason I have never tried it. My fiance and I strategically woke up early one Monday morning knowing that the weekend rush may have subsided, and to our satisfaction - we did not have to wait in line at all. We went right up to the register and ordered a sausage egg and cheese sandwich for me and bacon egg and cheese sandwich for my fiance. I was trying to make small talk with the girl at the register, but she wasn't really having it. In her defense she did say that she had worked the overnight shift and that they are busiest overnight from the people getting out of the club next-door. We put in our order and had probably less than a five minute wait. The place was busy, but not so busy that we weren't able to get quick service. We took our sandwiches to go and headed upstairs to our balcony suite to enjoy them. Or so we thought. The expectations were so high about this place because I've heard about it for years and never tried it, plus the fact that we were both starving - I had to remind myself to lower my expectations in order to enjoy it. They were served in a cute little to-go box, (photographed below.) we were very much looking forward to taking a bite. My first bite, egg yolk splashed everywhere. I found it to be quite ironic because of the name. Also photographed below. To both of our dissatisfaction, our sandwiches were terrible. I know, that is probably not the direction you saw the story going. My sausage, was so hard - I could barely get my teeth through it. I took one bite and then tossed it to the side. The bread was delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly, but that sausage literally and figuratively put a bad taste in my mouth. Also, my fiance does not like ketchup and there was ketchup all over his sandwich. In what world does a sandwich come with ketchup already on it? We were both disgusted and it killed our appetites for the entire day. That pissed me off because I really love Las Vegas dining and we were so excited to try this place. Pure dissatisfaction. If you have to satisfy the urge to try this place because of the hype, do go ahead but go on an off day so you don't have to wait in line. I think you would be more pissed off if you waited in a long line for that gross sandwich.",

Came up to about $35 for all three. Would order the Fairfax again, and the Slut just for the cute glass jar. Service from Derrick was great as well!  This is something I would have friends visiting in town try, but not sure if it's something I'd crave for.",

It was still about 40 for two breakfast sandwiches, two biscuits and a coffee... But I would totally go here again. We both had the Fairfax I added turkey sausage my fiance ordered the same but with avocado and bacon. Both were delicious! I definitely would love to try other options but I liked this sandwich so much it would be hard to order something else. The biscuits come with a honey butter that's yummy but they are big, I could have split it.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely delicious! I was expecting this to be over-hyped but the food blew my mind. If I were to choose, I would order...  (1) The Fairfax Burger Any burger is good but I absolutely loved the Fairfax. The brioche bun was so perfectly fluffy. The egg itself was fluffy and yummy. If you are up for it - would certainly recommend adding bacon. The bacon pieces are huge and cooked perfectly!  (2) The Sxxx (Yes - it is called a profane word) I would recommend this if you are looking for something light. It is essentially a few pieces of baguette slices and a delicious mix of coddled egg and potato puree. The texture of the egg/potato mix was very addictive. Really great for potato lovers!  Tip: Expect a really long lineup between 11:00AM and 1:00PM. Outside of those hours, lineups were tolerable. That being said, the place has a really good and efficient system. Lineup goes by pretty fast.  If you are going with a group and planning to eat in, it might be good to split up and have some people order and some people claim a table.",

It was pretty empty, which somehow made service worse.   They didn't call my name when the order was ready.  Someone came and took half our order. When my husband went up to ask about our order, the guy said here it is... My husband noted we were missing the Gaucho.  The guy said \"oh some guy came and took it... Do you want this bagel sandwich instead?\"  Someone walks out and says \"man what's wrong with you make him another one!\" The guy makes another one. Leaves it behind the counter, walks away and starts chatting with other workers who are also doing nothing (no line). One of them is dancing.  I walk up and yell over to them \"is this the Gaucho reorder?\" (pointing to behind the counter)  Another guy is like oh yeah it is.. the cashier apologizes for the wait/mix up.   I'm walking away completely astonished by the entire process.   My husband asks for the lid to our glass jar for the \"slut\" as we didn't finish it. The guy hands him a legitimately dirty lid.   Food is good but only worth it when there's no wait.   1* for the serious lack of brains behind half of today's staff.",

I was getting a little more hyped while I was in the infamous line and then after my first few bites I was like \"ok it's not hitting the spot..not bad..but not worth the wait.\" Actually now that I think about it, I wouldn't even go back again even if there was no wait! I would get something for a friend that hasn't tried it before and likes eggs because maybe they would appreciate it more and then walk next door for juice.   I had the Fairfax sandwich on brioche (the bread I am definitely not a fan of and I can't believe is their default option but maybe others like it more than me) and the eggslut. This was ok but we didn't even finish the glass so that says something on its own. Cheers!",

I wanted to go since I never made the trip to LA and do love a good breakfast sandwich. We came at like 3AM and waited in line quite a bit-probably 30 minutes or more. The price was ridiculous. I don't know how much it is in LA, so I assume these prices are hiked. I paid $11 for a breakfast sandwich that my friend said she would've rather gone to McDonald's for. $2 extra for avocado and I felt they were really skimpy on that.   The one good thing is parking was complimentary and the restaurant was located almost right outside  of the elevator from self parking.   Definitely don't feel the need to go here ever again in Vegas or LA.",

The hot and crispy brioche buns with thick cut bacon, not a skimpy amount either, with cheese, and eggs that as I bit down the yolk just coated my pallet with richness.

    "text": "Eggslut has opened a few locations in the Los Angeles area and has become a really popular breakfast spot.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas I got an opportunity to finally try this place at their only location outside of the Los Angeles area.  Situated in the Cosmopolitan hotel, this place always has a line and a steady stream of customers coming and going.  Fortunately for me the line was only 20 minutes on a weekday morning.  I ordered their popular slut as well as their fairfax sandwich.  My order was ready to pick up, 5 minutes after ordering.  Slut ($10.50) - A cage-free coddled egg on top of a potato puree, cooked in a glass jar and topped with chives was the main part of this entree.  3 small slices of a baguette accompanied this dish.  The presentation was unique.  Using a plastic spoon I scooped out some of the potato puree and coddled egg and spread it on the baguette.  The runny yolk, egg white, and potato puree spread nicely on the crispy baguette.  Everything tasted great and went well together.  Fairfax Sandwich ($8.50) -  This consisted of cage-free soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, siracha mayo, served between a warm brioche bun.  While the sandwich wasn't as big and filling as I was hoping it to be, it tasted pretty good.  The scrambled eggs were soft and a little runny.  All the ingredients went well together for an excellent flavor profile.  The use of a soft brioche bun was a wise decision.  I definitely preferred the sandwich over their signature item, the slut.  Overall the items I tried were unique and tasted pretty good.  Pricing is a little on the high side for what is being offered.  However I think the presentation and the uniqueness of the dishes are impressive.  Eggs had been getting a bad rap in the past but now all of a sudden they have become popular and are good for you.  This is a great spot to get one's breakfast fix!",

If you're looking for a simple meal, yet decently priced (for Vegas standards), you can't go wrong at all. Located on the 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan, there is often a line to order food, could either be really long (late breakfast/lunch) or short (dinner, early morning).  The menu is pretty simple: all variations of egg plates, a few other sandwiches, and even a burger. Both times I got the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich....excellent! Decently sized, the bacon is crisp with every bite, egg is perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth after each bite with the cheese and ketchup....perfection!  My only big gripe, $5 each drinks?! A small cup of black coffee, small orange juice, small cold brew...all $5. Pretty steep. I would suggest to bring your own drink from the casinos or Starbucks. Other than that, this place is an A+...is it worth the wait? Depends on how far the line is. Past the bathroom doors around the corner...come back later.",

    "text": "Despite, not being really into eggs (I hate runny yolks), I've still always wanted to try Eggslut when I'd go down to SoCal but never got an opportunity. So, I was happy to find a location in Las Vegas.  Eggslut is located inside the Cosmopolitan across from Marquee. Went here on a Tuesday morning at around 9am and waited in line for maybe 15-20 minutes or so. I was actually surprised to see the line so long for a weekday.   Ordered the Fairfax with turkey sausage. It was really good. I love scrambled eggs and eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice and fluffy and not dry at all. I devoured it pretty fast and would definitely get it again.  Only complaint is the wait for our food took awhile and that there is no water available, to either self-serve or a cup of water. There was only bottled water available for purchase. I opted for OJ instead and that was $5 for a small cup. But it was freshly squeezed and it tasted good. So I guess. haha Otherwise I would've just lugged with me my hydroflask next time.   I would definitely return. Its a nice filling breakfast that's quick and easy (aka slutty). haha",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of breakfast so I can't help but be biased. My friend recommended this place for us to eat breakfast at while on our vacation in Vegas. When we got here, oh man what time was it. I want to say it was around 11am, we waited in line about 30 minutes. The line wrapped around all the way down the hallway. Halfway through the line, someone came out saying that the slut would not be ready for another 45 minutes which was fine because we didn't want the slut.   We ordered a bacon egg sandwich, 2 sausage egg sandwich, fairway sandwich, and the gaucho sandwich. The bacon sandwich was good, bacon was nice and crispy and full of flavor, however, the egg was overcooked so the yolk was not runny at all. The sausage sandwich was good as well. The sausage was a little bland and dry but the egg was nice and runny. The steak in the gaucho sandwich was delicious. It was a nice medium rare consistency and had great flavor. As a sandwich though, it didn't really tie well together but the steak by itself was delicious. The fairway sandwich was okay as well. It was scrambled eggs instead of a full egg. I felt that it was way too mushy and wet and didn't really have much flavor.   Again, I'm not a breakfast person so I'm a little biased. This place is over hyped for me. Food is not that great and it was expensive for a breakfast sandwich the size of your palm. My other friends seemed to like it but again, the eggs on all of the sandwiches weren't very consistent. One was over cooked, another was too runny and another was fine.   Food is okay, service is fine considering you order at a counter and then pick up the order at a counter. Seems to be really popular so beat the crowd at a less popuilar time or be prepared to wait.",

The orange juice tastes amazing and you can tell that it's freshly squeezed. The line was long but pretty efficient. Plenty of room to sit down with your friends so no need to worry about seats. Good music is amazing laying in the background and the atmosphere is pretty chill. My friend had the sausage sandwich and said it tasted amazing so maybe next time I'm here in Vegas I'll try the sausage sandwich next!",

Eggslut lived up to that criteria with perfectly soft scrambled eggs in the fairfax ($8) and delicious poached eggs in the slut ($10). Of the two, the slut was my favorite with the crusty bread pairing nicely with the soft runny egg and mashed potatoes.  Only downside is that they will not give you a free cup of tap water. So save yourself some extra $$ and head downstairs to the casino bar to grab a cup of free water first.",

I've heard so much about this place and am beyond stoked to have been able to try it. Every time we walked by, regardless of the time of day, there was a HUGE line!   When we went for breakfast/brunch around 11a, the line was SO long. We almost walked away but kept hearing that it was worth the wait and that the line went surprisingly fast. An hour later, we had an ooey, gooey, perfectly cooked egg sandwich in our hands!   Most of us actually went with their burger because it just sounded incredible and after waiting an hour and smelling the deliciousness, we were STARVING! It had a runny egg, caramelized onions, bread and butter pickles, cheddar, dijonnaise, and a fluffy brioche bun. YES, PLEASE! The burger was legit and definitely worth the wait! If you're nearby and are contemplating the wait, JUST DO IT. You won't be disappointed and your hangover will thank you.",

I am glad I finally went to one, as I would assume that the LA is the same quality, if not better if possible.  I had a great breakfast sandwich. The bread was toasted well. The eggs were nice and fluffy. The cheese was ooey and gooey! They were generous with the bacon and seemed like it was cooked with expertise. I am a fan of black coffee, so I enjoyed their cold brew.  This place fits the aesthetic of Cosmopolitan. The whole place is visually appealing.   I had a very good experience at Eggslut. I will be coming here for more breakfast food if I ever find myself on the strip in the morning!",

The plan was to order to go to take it to our separate rooms, but split the Fairfax and eat there.  So we split the Fairfax and woah! The soft scrambled egg with the sriracha mayo was out of this world! After scarfing down that sandwich it was game on for the other two that we were suppose to be to-go.  It was soooo good that back to the back of the line we went to get another order of the Fairfax. So another 30 mins or so we had two orders of Fairfax sandwiches and called it a night.  When I got back to my room, I can't believe I ate the whole thing.....again! But I went to bed happy! :-)",

I can see why the slut is such a popular item! It's a glass jar with puree potatoes, an egg, topped with grey salt and chives - cooked to perfection with the sous vide method. It came with three slices of baked baguette, which I wish they gave more of so I could have devoured the entire jar of goodness. The sandwich was good as the bacon was thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. I would ask for the chipotle ketchup on the side next time because it overwhelmed some bites of my sandwich. Overall I would come back! Just be sure to not be in a rush due to the wait and the limited sitting area.",

We ordered at the front and our food came out pretty quickly, which I appreciate!  I highly recommend the The SLUT! - 5/5! Get the Slut if you love a potato and egg. It's a savory velvety goodness of potato puree with perfectly soft boiled egg on top that you spread all over their toasted baguette.

The scrambled eggs on the \"Fairfax\" are so creamy and the onions, sriracha mayo, cheese on a brioche bun is just an overall great combo. The portion size of the \"slut\" compared to the cost, may seem pricey, but this potato puree magicalness is worth it! The prices are a bit more expensive than the LA location, but the taste is just the same. A restaurant that can keep original quality in a 2nd location gets 5 stars in my book!",

My friend and I split a sausage, egg, and cheese ($8) and the slut ($10). My friend personally liked the slut more, but I preferred the sandwich. For the price, I'd say the slut was an interesting taste to try, but it alone wouldn't have filled me up. I had a couple bites of the slut (phrasing?) and I would say that was enough for me. The sandwich was pretty solid and okay for the Las Vegas pricing in a nice hotel.   Fair warning, there will be a long wait. When I went, I waited 30+ minutes to order. I would say that the food was solid, but not amazing enough to wait 30-45 minutes to order. I'd go again if the line was shorter.   4/5 taste  3.5/5 bang for buck",

Both brioche buns were super dense and could have been half as \"bready\". It took away from the sandwich. Egg salad was missing flavor, but the arugula garnish was well dressed. Bacon, egg and cheese was just basic and also lacking flavor. The menu items look fantastic, but overall, missing that key seasoning/flavor ingredient. Won't be going back during our stay.",

    "text": "I can definitely see how this is a popular spot. Great for young college kids or people not looking to spend a grip on a buffet breakfast. Nice breakfast sandwiches on fresh bread. I recommend asking for no ketchup it comes standard on sandwiches and I don't like ketchup. Right outside of the club and affordable. $8.50 avg per sandwich. I was hoping there would be more on the menu but they are popular for the egg \"slut\" and that is what they specialize in. Do not buy their coffee. It's $5 and not good. Just grab one from Starbucks on your way or right after you get your food.",

The sandwich came out immediately send I was told the Slut will take just. Little longer. 15 minutes later it was ready. By then the sandwich was cold, the coffee was cold, and we were disappointed. How about ask if we want the items together as the Slit takes longer.  I don't mind waiting, but I want the entire party to eat hot food together.  With the price so high, the service should be impeccable.",
