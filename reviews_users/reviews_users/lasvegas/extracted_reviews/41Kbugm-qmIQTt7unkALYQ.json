I can't remember what we got, but they sure were good.    You can keep the cup, and your refills are only $13.00.  The initial drink is $16.00  Usually we get our drinks at one of the other outside bars, and they just weren't worth it!  From here on out, I know where I'm getting my drinks on Fremont street",

On our trip today my wife and I ordered the shrimp cocktail which was delicious. For our entrees we both ordered the prime rib, medium. The meat seemed high quality and seasoned well, but neither was cooked correctly. Mine was overdone and hers was under cooked. Why would they send out the same meat with one bleeding and one charred? When we let our server know he did nothing about it.   I'm also very disappointed in the wine and whiskey selections. You would think they would have a great selection but it was below standard.   Again, the views, the ambiance and basic food are great. The price would be okay if these side issues were taken care of. I just wish they would tighten up some loose ends and step it up.",

    "text": "Overall, a pleasing, old-school steakhouse experience- with a view!    The service and staff were great. Very attentive and professional.  The environment was lovely- large windows all around, so every seat had a view of downtown. It was dimly lit and really felt as though you'd been transported back to Old Vegas.  Food was good- and very fairly priced. Nothing particularly \"wow-ed\" me, but everything was solid. Entrees include a choice of potato (baked, garlic mashed, roasted, or risotto), as well as a vegetable. Bottled water and warm rolls were also included. I had the chicken fried lobster ($57), which was more interesting on paper than in taste. The lobster was good, but having it fried really didn't add anything to it. I had to add hot sauce and horseradish to add some flavor. My husband had the 16oz prime rib ($38) and thought that it was great! (I did as well). The 24oz would have been WAY too big.   We were given a free dessert for our anniversary. I'm not exactly sure what it was- a raspberry concoction of sorts. It was tasty, though.  The host happily took pictures of us, and we went down the very scary glass elevator to depart. I",

We shared the large 24oz prime rib with a baked potato. It was plenty of food and it was done perfectly. To start we also had the spinach artichoke dip.  Great food, excellent service.

    "text": "Awwww...review 100!  For the 16th anniversary celebrating our first kiss - we opted to try yet another classic vintage Vegas steakhouse.  Kind of ironic when you consider that neither of us eat steak - but we both appreciate old school fare and flair.  Our anniversary fell on 12-12-12 and the National Finals Rodeo was in town so Binion's was PACKED with an interesting mix of stetson and jean wearing dung kickers and newly married husbands and wives in their finest whites.    Although we had reservations and arrived on time, we still had to wait 15 or so minutes for our table to be ready.  The atmosphere is dark and clubby, with tin ceiling panels, dark woods and red and gold faux-flocked wallpaper.  While waiting, we took a walk through the restaurant and marveled at the 24th-floor views. Our table was well worth waiting for as we got a window seat!  Navigating steakhouse menus are always an interesting challenge for the non-red meat eater - I always opt for a seafood entree these days.  Although the Chicken Fried Lobster sounded like a curious abomination that I really wanted to tackle - the term \"market price\" scared me off.  In the end, I ordered a rather tame Iceberg Wedge Salad and the Shrimp Scampi for an entree.  We split a celebratory bottle of Moet.  I specifically ordered the Iceberg Wedge as it was described as not having bacon on it - it came with bacon. A little annoying, but I just pushed the bacon aside and ate the rest.  The Italian dressing was tasty!  The wait was quite lengthy between courses but with stellar company, the sparkling and the view - I didn't mind so much.  My Scampi came with 5 very nice plump tail on shrimp with a side of buttery green beans and a baked potato.  The sauce that they serve with the scampi was dense and unbelievably decadent!  It seemed to be made of much more than just the butter, garlic, white wine and fresh herbs described on the menu (possibly some dairy in there?)  A solid classic entree for a solid classic place.  NOTE: The name of this restaurant has officially been changed to \"Top Of Binion's Steakhouse\".  Is there anyway to change this on Yelp?",

Last year our steaks were over cooked and when we addressed this with our waiter, Jeffrey ,he wanted to bring out another steak...too late.  Who wants to wait for a steak when your group in already eating?  Next to us was a group of drunk loud and obnoxious men.  When this was addressed to our waiter we received a passive oh well type response.  Only the cost of the steak was deducted from the bill.  This year we gave Binions another try.  We had a different waiter, and the food was good (not great).  Unfortunately, as we were dining, two men were seated at the table next to us and were waited on by Jeffrey.  The men were drunk loud and obnoxious.  The loud exchanges between the two men included frequent profanity and the F word. Really ?  Not again !  To make things worse, Jeffrey participated in the very loud conversations.   We were unable to converse in normal tones at our own table.  What a shame.  This trip we were celebrating a 50th Birthday.  This was relayed in the reservation and the Birthday girl wore a birthday tiara.  The host wished her a happy birthday .  Our waiter did not recognize her Birthday as is the usual custom.  Next year...we won't be going to Binions.  There are too many other great restaurants for us to experience and spend our money at",

We started with the escargot($16/which Jeffery recommended) and it was flavorful and unique with a little puff pastry on top! My wife had the 10oz filet($49) and I had the 16oz ribeye($48). The filet melted in your mouth while the ribeye exploded with juicy, tender goodness! Add 2 grey goose cocktails and one glass of a nice Pinot Noir and the bill was $157 before tip. Not bad for as good a meal as we had. Truthfully, could've cost us $200 and I wouldn't have batted an eye. This is definitely a place where you tip 20% minimum.

The bread crumbs over powered the lobster and ut was completely unseasoned. The menu said market price but the price has been consistently $57.95 for awhile. Please do not order this.  The view of the city is incredible. The ciew is 5 stars but tge rest of the restaurant was 2.5 stars at best. (Above says 3 stars because I did not have the half star option). The food was not close to the quality I have come to expect from a steakhouse.   The interior is exetremely dated. A makeover is 20 years over due. It is exetremely dark inside. Romantic setting. Burgundy booths, dark wood, burgundy grandma 'wall paper, casino hotel hallway carpet, chairs to match.The decor is definitely in the mold of historic old school Vegas. However nostalgia is not enough to make this work. It can pass for a date with a quality mature woman that is already into you.   The spinach salad with bacon dressing was ok. The menu says hard boiled eggs, chopped bacon and bleu cheese are in it but you would be hard pressed to find any.   The lobster bisque is average. I would like morw lobsrer in it. They did not hace risotto evwn though itnis listed as a daily option on the menu. Rice pilaf was offered as a su substitue.  The service was ok. I tipped 20% even though the food was sub par. It's not their fault. They do not prepare the meals. Although I do not like when a server stands at my table to watch me fill out a credit card receipt.",

You'd expect a steak house to know how to cook steak right? Steak was very hard, almost like a very bad cut and over cooked.  Probably at the end of our meal, manager comes around asks how things are doing? Steak is over cooked I say, and he asks if he could make up by a dessert? I say no, he asked for another steak I say no, we had a show to attend so we didn't have time to sit around any longer.   Long story short they should've taken the steak off the bill as it wasn't cooked correctly, but they didn't.   I was weary of going here to dine in, and I should've trusted my gut instinct.  I could've cooked a better steak myself.  Go there for the view, not the food you'll be disappointed!",

It's hard to hold a conversation without yelling and leaning in very close to your company in order to hear what they're saying. Is this is really a fancy steak joint or just someplace pretending to be such?  Most of the staff seem upset or in a bad mood, as a whole. Our waiter, in whatever rush he was doing, poured water so fast and furious into my glass that a great majority spilled onto the table, soaking all the way down and onto my attire for the night. He walked away, which left me in slightly stunned silence and didn't see him return to fix this issue until around 5 minutes later. The fix? Tossing a cloth napkin down and apologizing. I must have pissed somebody in this place in under 5 minutes to be subjected to such.  But anyways, onto the rest.  The service was a little sketchy, but food was good. Great portion size for the price. $37 for a 16oz rib eye is actually not that bad when you compared it to your places back home or have been to.  I'm going to chalk this experience up as a bad first impression but will return to see if the experience is different the next time around or not.  Despite the bad situation with the water and the volume of talking being close to that of being in a nightclub, I'm giving this place 3 stars for the food and the price of such. I would still recommend people to visit and try it.",

At times as it slowly creaked to the top, it felt like you were riding an old rollercoaster on its ascent.  I ordered the chicken Marsala and my friend ordered one of the steaks. The chicken marsala as in most restaurants, was white meat (I only like dark meat) but it wasn't bad.  Probably not what to order at a steakhouse, but I wasn't in the mood for steak or seafood.  The basket of warm rolls were good though. The sauce was a bit too salty for me, by my friend liked it alot.  He seemed to enjoy his steak too. With drinks and expresso, the bill came out to $107.  Not bad, but I'm sure there are better steakhouses in this area.  Service was attentive but not in your face. Definitely the ambiance of old Vegas inside, which was rather charming.",

I have never tried it before and with the decent reviews and the ad stating it had the best view in Las Vegas, I thought what the heck.  I called and made reservations and told them It was our anniversary and asked for a table with a nice view.  We arrived up the elevator with another couple.  They asked if we had reservation and I said yes, the other couple said no.  We were taken to a table only one spot away from the desk and right across from the kitchen.  The couple without the reservations were taken down the way a bit and placed in a booth.  I guess when I asked for a nice view the kitchen help was what they considered nice.  They had a view of northwest Vegas, we had a view of building tops and other hotels.  We saw the waiter three times the entire time we were there.  Once to take our drink order, once to take our food order and to give us the bill.  If not for the bus boy we would have felt alone.  I wanted to order a beer with dinner but I never had that opportunity.  The food was better than average but not worth the price.  Outback, half the price and almost as good, with better service.  Outback is louder but not busier since we were next to the kitchen, but the server comes and checks in on you now and again at Outback.  Would I go back there?  Absolutely not!  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely not!  There are too many high quality steak houses in Las Vegas to take a chance of ending up with a sour taste in my mouth for the entire dinner again.",

We ordered the Shrimp Scampi, Rib Eye, Filet, Lobster Bisque (SUPER salty-ick!!), and were overall satisfied.  The apple cobbler dessert is underwhelming, I wouldn't recommend it.    Perfect view and a great location Downtown.  Decent attentive service and darn good coffee!!  We made reservations via Open Table and had no problem.  I would go again if I was Downtown.",

    "text": "Very disappointed!  We had read good reviews about Binion's, so we tried it on Saturday night.  First of all, the place is a little worn with age and the decor is need of updating.  The view is OK, but not as spectacular as the Stratosphere.  The service was OK, but oh my, the food was terrible.  The dinner rolls were so hard that it took booth hands to break them apart and then they crumbled all over the table.  I ordered French Onion Soup and it was the worst I've ever had (my favorite is at Outback)--I sipped a couple of spoons and turned it away.  My wife and I both ordered the 16 oz Prime Rib, their specialty.  It was very fatty and full of gristle, so we spent most of our time trimming away the fat.  The green beans were rubbery and cold.  My wife couldn't eat more than a few bites and we hastily got the check (for $122) and left, never to return again.  On the way down the elevator, we met a crowd of 6-8 folks waiting to go up and they asked us if it was worth it.  We told them about our experience and recommended they go to Oscars, just down the street and they quickly left Binion's and headed for Oscars (which we love).",

    "text": "I have been to Binions Steak House many times because I love the downtown experience and the view from Binions is fabulous.  Unfortunately the food at the steak house continues to be a disappointment.  A few years back, you could always count on Binions to have a fantastic Ribeye, but the last few times dining there, the quality of the meat seems to be lacking.  I will admit, my standards for a steak will vary based on the price (ie. my standards are higher for a $40 steak vs. my standards for a $20 steak), but the quality of the meat just is not up to snuff.  Basically it is the quality of a Longhorn of Outback...which is not bad for $20, but at $40 it is disappointing.  I can only hope they will return to using a better quality meat.  On a positive note, one of the people dining with me said the lamb chops were fantastic.  As for service, the host was snooty, but the waiters were friendly and efficient.",

    "text": "We might be the first couple ever to go from a blowout night at Joel Robuchon to the next night at Binion's. We loved it. Two manhattans apiece and all the nostalgia and cow we could handle in one night was a True bargain. The setting, overlooking the strip from atop Binion's downtown, is fantastic - use the glass elevator to get there! The restaurant, with dark wood paneling and lots of burgundy accents, conjures up a steakhouse atmosphere that I didn't think existed anymore. But this is no working theme park; the kitchen knows what it's doing for the most part. Service is friendly, efficient and professional. The food exceeded (admittedly low) expectations. My husband got the escargot to start, and they were well made in a very traditional garlic-herb butter. The salads were nice. Of course, being a steakhouse, beef is the star here, and Binion's delivered. My extra-rare filet was perfectly cooked and richly flavorful while my husband's rare ribeye was nicely seared and very tasty. It wasn't the very best steaks we've had, but it was very good indeed. The beef had that nice depth that Western beef seems to have. The only quibble with the meat is that it was underseasoned - we needed both the salt and pepper shakers on the table. The sides were a bit pedestrian; my husband's loaded baked potato was particularly clumsy but the vegetables were cooked properly. This is the place where time stood still, and we're grateful for that. It's a taste of old Vegas.",

We went during the sunset. The decor was dark and classic Vegas. With the old hotels surrounding it is a Las Vegas time machine up there. The maitre'd and the waitstaff were accommodating and professional. We ordered Oysters Rockefeller. They were small and cooked well, with a little crust so to speak. Which was a nice difference from the ways I have had them before. I had a filet and king crab legs. The steak was cooked to order and the crab was split open nicely and tasted perfect. The sides were just fine. The wine list was affordable and ample. I thought this was a great choice for a downtown steak place. Especially for those interested in vintage Las Vegas. Make sure to see the million dollars the have on display in the lobby.",

    "text": "Everything was absolutely fantastic. We happened to be in Vegas for business and had plenty of time to fit in some fun as well. While looking for dining options I stumbled across this place on the Fremont Street website. Out of curiousity I was checking out room prices @ Binions and noticed they were no longer accepting reservations. After reading Yelp reviews of this restaurant and other review sites I knew we just couldn't miss our (maybe only) chance to dine here before it (may be) gone forever.   We made reservations a month in advance because we really hoped for a table with the fantastic view we'd read about. We didn't anticipate how long it would take to get our car from the valet at our hotel or factor in getting slightly off track on our way causing us to be late. We called the restaurant to inform them of our delay and we were told \"no Problem\" When we arrived about 20 minutes later we were told by the hostess that we would need to wait now as our table was given away and there was nothing in the computer regarding our courtesy call that we were running later than expected. She wasn't rude exactly just very blunt and unsympathetic. No problem from us - we are late and have no issue with waiting. Just as we decided to head to the bar for a cocktail while wait ing, she whispered to us that she will go ahead and seat us even though there are walk-ins now waiting. We greatly appreciated this and it made up for her slight indifference upon arriving.  We did not get a window table, but our view was outstanding anyway. We were nearly in the middle of the room with panoramic views on 2 sides. It really was gorgeous The atmosphere here is has an old vegas feel almost with the low light and the table linens and set up, the deep booths. It just has a great feel to it. It's not just fine dining it is Classic dining that isn't necessarily seen in Vegas as often with most restaurants having a gimic of some kind.   I do agree with other reviewers that have mentioned the darkness. I could use maybe a second wick on the table candle for a little more brightness. But you do get used to it and I found it enjoyable and liked the sense of an intimate dinner for 2 even when surrounded by people. My only real complaint was that a table adjacent to us had several people visiting them that weren't dining there and they were very loud and intrusive and distracting and in the way of other diners getting to their seats. I felt that the party should have been asked to take the conversation to the bar or hallway just a few short steps away So not to disturb the rest of us.  But let me get to the good stuff. Service was fantabulous. I never needed a single thing as every need was taken care of nearly before I asked without ever feeling like the waiter was hovering. I like the bottled water served, although it should be kept on ice as I like my water very cold. The wine menu was very extensive and not extremely overpriced.   The onion soup was wonderful. Perfectly oniony. Perfectly cheesy. Perfectly salty. the shrimp cocktail was also wonderful. It was served old school style. Very large shrimp perfectly chilled and not wet served on a bed of cabbage (or lettuce - too dark in there to tell) And on a separate platter you get saltines, a huge portion of horseradish, lemon, cocktail and remoulade sauce as well that I didn't try, I was too excited over the horseradish.  We both had NY steaks with the cabernet sauce. the steaks were exceptional. I don't feel like I am exaggerating when I say it may be the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked just the way we asked with just the right amount of char on the outside. The cabernet sauce was nothing special, but a very tasty thick brown gravy with a bit more depth. The baked potato was good and the the roasted red potatoes were tasty but not exceptional. the same with the veggies. But I must say this over and over again. The steaks were perfect and exceptional. If you are looking to forget the sides and just be wowed by the cut of meat and amazing grill master in the back then this is the place for you.",

My girlfriend and I were there and had a great time.  The service was excellent and very friendly.  OUr appitizers included escargot and oysters rockefeller.  The escargot was indeed good, but I have had better, the oysters Rcokefeller were some of the best I've had! As for dinner I ordered the prime rib and she had the ribeye.  Both were amazing especially my prime-rib!  All of the meat here is prime choice, the best, unlike most steakhouses today.  The prime-rib was the best I've had or at least tied with the best I've had from a place I ate at years ago in WI, but that place is long gone, so I guess Binion's holds the title alone.  OUr creme' brulee desert was done perfect and I highly recomend it.  Go there hungry yelpers, I thought the place was great, and I have to put it as one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas.",

We had been very happy customers who enjoyed many wonderful meals there.  Tonight we were in town, and went back to Binion's  only to have a very different experience.  I ordered a porterhouse steak along wtih their mixed greens salad.  I have to agree wtih a previous reviewer, who found their raspberry dressing more resembling a cloyingly sweet, dessert offering than a salad dressing.  After which came my steak, served cold.  (no sizzle here)  My impression is that the quality of the meat was of a very different caliber than the excellent product previously served.  It seems that gone, were the \"prime\" or apparently even the \"choice\" cuts of yesteryear.  Our waiter while very pleasant, was typically \"lost in action\". He was absent for very long stretches, save for the times when he wanted to clear our plates prior to us finishing our food.  This was really a very disappointing dining experience at a restaurant that was former favorite.  I do not think that I will venture back here.  A pity for sure.",

I had done a bit of research ahead of time,  and every thing pointed us in this direction.   We pre-gamed a bit on Freemont Street before making our way to the super secret elevator that took us to the top of Binions.  The view is breathtaking.  The tables set nicely with crisp white tablecloths and linen napkins.   The service was impeccable, and we never wanted for anything.  Maybe that's because the Restaurant was mostly empty, but hey, it was on a Tuesday evening. We went with the prime rib, and gladly paid the $15 split plate charge which got me my own salad, baked potato au jus and horseradish.  We shared a 24oz cut of meat, and it really was well seasoned and delicious, and even after trimming the fat away there was more than enough.  (Because a little fat is inevitable with prime).  We also added the crab legs upgrade.  They came out already split, which made them easy to eat.  Very fresh tasting for sure.   If in Vegas give it s try.",

Served warm bread loaves (four for our table of 9) with cinnamon honey butter and our waiter REFILLED it!  Steaks were cooked perfectly (and were True to size - I had the 16oz rib eye and took half home!) and lobster Mac & Cheese (used as an appetizer to share) was the best many of us have tasted.  My tip: order the creamed corn \"shared side\" - we all LOVED it!  We called for reservations for that same night (Saturday after Thanksgiving) and were given a time only 40 minutes from our call time - loved that!  Gave us some time downstairs in the casino before taking the elevator upstairs to THAT VIEW!

They only have to vegetarian entrees to pick from the whole menu, which sucks, but I guess what can I expect it is a steak house after all. I chose the three cheese jumbo pasta, and I was not impressed. For 25 dollars for that plate, I expected it to be at least delicious, but I've tried better pasta from some Italian restaurants that are actually reasonably priced.  The service was not that great, they take very long to bring the food out and to take orders.  Overall I liked the view and the interior (old school) that about it. It's definitely overpriced for mediocre food and service.",

    "text": "Great view of the City with Great Steaks in an old style Steak House  For me this is as good s it gets. Exemplary service, outstanding food and a really nice view. Comfortable and plush surroundings, no one rushing you ever. I would go back here EVERY time I am in Vegas.  On top of great food and huge portions, they have a share a plate option for those of us that just can't eat 20 ounces of meat and all the trimmings any more. The second person gets a full pate of fixings of their own and you split the meat. IF I remember right the second plate was about $20. To be honest,we could have probably just split the one plate there is so much food. Average steak runs 40 to 50 bucks, which is a heck of a great deal. Compared to Ruth Crisp, it is almost free and the food is WAY better. Binion's is so confident in their value proposition they post their menu and prices right on their website. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftopofbinionssteakhouse.com&s=caf2814f662123090e28ed63c47f0536fa4cc13dc4cfc6c1306b1be40a7c6580\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">topofbinionssteakhouse.c...</a>  My wife, who is a world experienced expert on Creme Brule, voted theirs 2nd best in Vegas, Maggiano' still holds first though Benions had fesh raspberry, and a top ten world wide. If it had been slightly more browned with the torch, it would have been perfect and would have beat out Maggiano's.",

The menu is on the higher end price wise but it was worth it. Dinner for 4 people and a round of drinks was $250 so it isn't in most people's budget except for special occasions. I had the 24 ounce Blue Cheese Crusted Porter House steak and it was outstanding. The Prime Rib was good also but I preferred the Porter House. The side dishes were fresh and flavorful and the Cesar Salad met my expectations. If you like bourbon, I highly recommend enjoying an Old Fashioned while you wait for your dinner.",

The cost of the stack was over $40.00 and it was something I could have cooked at home.  Then came the plating.  I ordered the Au Gratin potato.  I should have gotten the baked potato.  It was a rectangle chuck of something on the plate.  It was not fully cooked and just looked awful on the plate.  Yuck. I didn't complain because the steak could not be cooked any better and all other steak cuts they would cook would have been a waste because if one was cooked like I could cook the chances of another steak cooked and tasting out of this world was slim to none.  So, why didn't I send back the Au Gratin Potato.  I just wanted to eat what I could and get out.    My server was okay.  Other servers were around more then he was with me.  He never refilled my water so I asked others to do it for me.  I was a single there and it seems to happen with all servers.  Big groups bring in more money but I am not using this as an excuse.  He just didn't pay enough attention to me.  Alone you would think a server would be more attentive but that is not True here.  Also since I was sitting right near where the servers area was I could hear their conversations which I didn't need to hear.   I will never go back and do not recommend it especially for steaks or for single travelers.",

I had to send my steak back as I ordered it rare and it was cooked to medium.  I sent it back and the second steak came 25 minutes later.  Complaining to the manager resulted in him buying us a round of drinks and that was all he said he would do.  He acted like he could care less.  We were there for over two hours due to waiting for food and nobody from the manager on down seemed to care that we were there.  This place has gone completely down hill since we were here last year.  On top of of that they have raised their prices and it is not the hidden gem it once was.

We ended up on Fremont Str and used our 6th sense to find a dining for a nice steak dinner. Germany our excellent waiter served some petite size fresh loaf of warm bread with creamed butter -(bread  was made with yeast , was moist and tasted like most of the French / Italian country bread - Yummy ) We ordered Crab Cakes ( I would use less seasoning to keep the essence of the crab taste )  But it was nice and moist.  French Onion Soup ( beef stock was a bit (restauran) salty . Then we ordered Filet Mignon / medium rare with mashed potatoes/sour cream . Mashed Potato was a little thick and heavy for a heavy slice meat but taste wise and flavor was very nice . ( Maybe whipping it up) Filet Mignon was OUTSTANDING and just damn delicious.  Also we ordered Ribeye Steak / Medium and it was just NICE as my Filet Mignon ... I had a glass of Malbec from Argentina  ( my second glass somehow ended up as a Cabernet Savingon - it was beautiful as well ) Thank you for the great dining   experience . We'll definitely choose you again .",

I had the prime rib and WOW... that was perfection! I swear the beef melted in my mouth. :)   The view is really great also, you get a good view of downtown vegas (fremont street) and the strip!! The elevator ride up is a little scary, I am afraid of heights and the elevator is made of glass!!   If you are looking for a good steak, and you like something old fashioned with some SInatra in the backround, this is the place for you! Also super romantic! ;)   Just dont eat too much, we ate around 10pm and we had planned to go out that night, but when we got back to the hotel so we could change our clothes, i made the mistake of lying down and didnt wake up till the next morning!!

The interior is dark and leathery, with Kenny G playing softly in the background. Bowtie-clad waiters circulate swiftly around the booths, carrying ponderous trays of beef and crab. The regulars, rolling in from the casino, gobble down plates of porterhouse and New York steak, accented by an occasional \"forget about it!\"  I agree with previous reviewers that there's no \"forced pleasantries\" here. In fact, the service was remarkably East Coast: alert, efficient and perhaps even a tad brusque for porcine suburbanites who like their egos stroked. But that suits me just fine. The Binion's Ranch \"experience\" is meat+view+butter. Not too shabby.   On a recent visit here, I shared an appetizer of Oysters Rockefeller, king crab legs with petit filet and a chicken fried lobster tail. All the dishes were about as good as the environs suggest...not an epic meal, but certainly quality ingredients and reliable preparation. In terms of price, its definitely not cheap, topping out at nearly $80 a head, but I think its probably worth it. Just enjoy the ostentatious platters and get carried away by the soprano sax.",

Then he asked if we wanted a booth (doesn't have the table view but I think a booth is more comfortable anyway--and we could still see the city).  When we said yes, he took us right away to our seat.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.  I ordered the filet mignon well done and it was cooked perfectly!  The garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful as well.  The asparagus was a little salty for my liking but this was hardly a setback.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. The service is good and the ambiance was great, but the food was lacking. After reading about it, me and the boys decided we had to try the Chicken Fried Lobster. What's the worse that could happen? Well to answer that, no seasoning. This was a nice piece of 8 ounce lobster pan fried in bread crumbs, no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no basil, nothing (at least you can't taste any seasoning). They serve it with warm drawn butter and a horrible orange colored sauce. When you think Chicken Fried you think of big flavor and this missed the mark. This could be a great dish, but it just isn't here. I sprinkled salt and pepper on it, but it only helped a little. The sauce they serve with it is bad. I did get an awesome loaded baked potato, but that's not what I came for. Lobster bisques (decent, but needed more lobster), salads, and the entrees, were about $250 before tip (no wine). We should have hopped a cab to DelFrisco's, Kraftsteak, Gallagher's, or just walked and tried Vic & Anthony's. I tried to give the old steakhouse a run, but I will not return unless it's to take the elevator ride, have a drink and get a great view of the city with someone who has never been to Vegas.",

I decided to try this place out because I was curious about the Chicken Fried Lobster on the menu. How can you not try that once? I've been back several times since, taking friends and dates and never had a bad experience with the restaurant.  The Lobster is definitely a must try, I've never had an instance of it overcooked or over breaded.  If you're looking for a good appetizer, the crab assortment is quite good too.  Desserts vary, last time I was there we had a cobbler with an Irish Cream Creme Anglaise - so good.  You have a main server and an assistant who is attentive without being intrusive.   I've also had dinner here on Fourth of July. You could see the fireworks down the strip and around the valley.  Great place to watch them for sure.",

It's like an amusement park of it's own, and Binion's fits right into the mix. It's a classic steakhouse, and I imagine the employees have been there forever. We had a great view from our corner table, and the menu is also a throwback. Oysters Rockefeller, real Caesar salad, and steak perfectly seasoned and cooked properly. No complaints at all, and I felt like I visited Vegas in the \"old days\". Afterwards we walked around people watching and were blown away by the crazy crowds, giant drinks, music and videos on the roof over Freemont Street. Great way to spend an evening.",

Inside, though, was a little too dark--dark enough that I didn't notice that my steak was WAY too rare until after I'd started into it and thought, \"Hmm, this seems a little...cold.\" That said, I'm two days out now from my dining experience and am pretty sure I have a mild case of food poisoning.  The garlic mashed potatoes were good, but a little paste-like. Beans were over-steamed. My friend ordered their wedge salad and I have safely never seen that much dressing on a cup and a half of salad in my life. She actually had to ask the waiter what it was when he handed it to her.  While I definitely fell in love with downtown Vegas, I don't think I'm going to go out of my way to go back to this place, though the chicken-fried lobster does sound interesting.  Oh, and ladies, watch your stilettos getting off the elevator! I caught mine in the gap and had the doors close on me twice before I got it free. And this was before the evening's wine. Hazard!!",

    "text": "My wife and I go to Vegas once or twice a year, and we always make sure to eat here at least once.  Personally, I love everything about the place.  As several people have mentioned, the atmosphere is fantastic.  The view from the 24th floor is great and the restaurant has an old fashioned elegance to it.  As some other people have also mentioned, much of the wait staff has been there forever, and they're all very professional.    The service is great - attentive but not overbearing, and the food is great as well.  We've tried all the appetizers but our favorite are the Oysters Rockefeller.  Absolutely delicious!  The steaks are always perfectly cooked.  I usually go for the porterhouse and my wife the filet mignon (she also loves the chicken fried lobster).  I disagree with people who say the place is expensive.  We eat there all the time and our bill typically comes out to around $150, which includes a couple of appetizers, entrees, desserts and coffee (neither of us drinks, so I can't attest to the price or quality of the cocktails).  I think this is pretty reasonable for a high end steakhouse.  It's certainly much less than some of the other high end steak joints in Vegas, like say Del Frisco's or Craftsteak, or any of the celebrity chef places.    Also, a lot of these other places price their menus ala carte, which can add up quick, whereas at Binion's, your steak comes with generous portions of potato and veggies included in the price.  You will definitely not leave here hungry!  One other tip for people who aren't Vegas regulars.  The casino at Binions, while it is , as people have mentioned, kind of dingy, it is also one of the more generous places I've gambled as far as giving out comps.  My wife and I will play some there during the week and by the time Saturday night rolls around we've often got $50 or $60 in comps between us to use towards dinner.",

For starters, they serve so much bread throughout the meal, one could fill up just on that. We ordered the artichoke dip: tasty but, a bit salty. My husband had the onion soup, again tasty but, too salty. I ordered the lobster bisque that came out with what appeared as and tasted like Yorkshire pudding, big chunks of lobster but, again, too much floured filler. My husband ordered the filet mignon medium rare and I ordered the smaller sized prime rib also medium rare. His steak came out still mooing. We told our waiter and he apologized and had it \"re-fired\". It came back looking exactly the same. The waiter checked in on us again but, we weren't going to have them try for a third time to get a $50 steak correct; too much man handling and frankly a steakhouse should know how to cook a steak in the first place. The waiter again apologized and told us the chef was sorry and would like to offer a complimentary dessert. Their desserts consist of various pastries (aka more baked goods). We declined and we ended up just sharing my decent/average PR. Overall, the place is a bit dingy (instead of a preserved Las Vegas Relic) and COMPLETELY overpriced for what you get. Should have gone to Lawry's.",

    "text": "I'm sure Bininos Steak House was a great place back in the '80s but this establishment is way past its prime. Granted Binions has become that place to go at least once if you're in downtown Vegas, mainly because of what it used to be and not so much of what it is now.   Of course the glass elevator taking you up is nice way to start the evening. Then the view is very cool at night. The restaurant it self is very dark and your typical old school steak house...dark woods, deep read banquets and carpet, and white table cloth.   The standard steak house starter, lobster bisque, had a decent flavor, but was gritty and the lobster meat was tough. This bisque definitely missed the sieve. The medium rare rib eye was perfectly cooked and I wish I could say the same for the flavor. The steak had zero seasoning. Although a juicy cut of meat, it lacked complete flavor. To top it off it had zero char. It appeared as if the steak was cooked on a backyard grill you bought at the grocery store. The Cabernet sauce was an attempt to add flavor, but the artificial taste from the sauce did not help much. As for the sides, it did not get much better. The beans were obviously frozen and not fresh, and the roasted potatoes were mushy. There was not much that could save this sad plate of food.   Desert was a last chance to have a decent bite in the restaurant but the creme brulee, although cooked very well, tasted more like eggs than sweet vanilla.   Service was awkward and inconsistent.   I can now say that I have been to the top of Binions but I sure won't be returning.",

    "text": "I went here for a coworker's birthday and was highly disappointed. The other reviews on the restaurant were great so my expectations were a little high. The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic with the spectacular views but the food and service left much to be desired. I work in the service industry so tend to be a little less critical but I was incredibly disappointed in Binions.   While our group was sitting down, one member (who happened to be visiting from another country) stood next to the window to take pictures and our server hovered over our table trying to take drink orders. He was clearly annoyed because she wasn't paying attention and he had to wait. We were there around 8:30 and there were maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant so it's not like he was that busy...I don't quite understand why he didn't step away and give us a few minutes to settle in before taking drink orders.  Now on to the food...I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for the steak but the seafood was awful. I'm from Seattle so have a taste for good, fresh fish and this restaurant did not have it. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and when the plate was set down in front of me, the first thing I saw was two slabs of gray meat. I kid you not, it looked like liver. Unfortunately for me it tasted as bad as it looked: dry and bland. And the sauce they chose? Yeah...it did not compliment it at all. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but didn't hold a candle to The Keg's.   Maybe it was an off night for Binion's but this was my first impression and with that being said, I'll never go back. The way I see it, they should treat every customer's experience like it's their first and \"wow\" them so they'll come back. Unfortunately, I was not \"wow'd\" and don't plan on visiting Binon's again.",

I ordered the NY strip with a baked potato as my side. I ordered medium well and it came out very medium. My friend's steak at first appeared more medium well so we switched it up and I still ended with a medium steak. It had a lot of flavor, but I am always disappointed when they don't cook it to order. I'm sure they aren't use to people ever ordering the steaks above medium. They had a great deal on some bottles of wines, so we split a bottle and I was happy with our choice.

    "text": "Binion's Steakhouse is located in downtown Las Vegas at the top of their building. Too much history to even begin to get into, but suffice to say, this is \"old Vegas.\" People that gamble, drink and eat downtown are treated to a more friendly side of the town where it is not all about being looked at as walking revenue. Here, you are treated with respect and appreciation as soon as you enter. Make no mistake, there is nothing real fancy about Binions. It was never intended to be plush and opulent. It's ambiance is for those of us that enjoy an atmosphere of days gone past. It's a saloon, gambling hall, and features a terrific steakhouse and coffee shop. Note: back in the 70's, steaks with all the trimmings were $2.00 after midnight ! Ahhh, the good old days...  The menu is very straightforward and offers (predictably) a larger selection of steaks and chops than other restaurants owned or managed by name recognized chefs. The food is good, the service is good, and the views of the strip or downtown only add to the experience. Should you ever have a problem, mention the issue to your server, or the manager, and I am positive that they will correct the problem. Having dined there many times over the last 26-years, I have never encountered a single issue with food or service. Not once.  This is not an award winning restaurant. So, if you are looking to dress to the absolute nines, and spend $500 on dinner with your date, you can find a lot of those places on the strip that will accommodate you. At Binion's Steakhouse, you are going to get a good meal, and not over pay either. Visit the bar too. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly enough to chat with you. They pour some good whiskey too! And, by the way, Binion's has a respectable wine menu that is also priced fair.  In Las Vegas, there are a lot of steakhouses.  Binion's offers good food, fairly priced, in an adult atmosphere. If you are a steak lover, give Binion's a try.",

I kept suggesting that maybe we were lost and this was the wrong place.  When we actually got to the restaurant, I got it.  The restaurant was dimly lit, but romantic.  And the view was beautiful.    The food IMHO was okay, I had the smallest sized prime rib and hardly made a dent, I wish I saw the specials before walking in, because me and steak/prime rib don't make a good combo.  The escargot however was yummy especially when I dipped the bread into the butter.    Overall, for the price and the effort put into looking for the damn place, I would have rather of gone to another nice restaurant that was actually on the strip.",

But if you really love steak and want something special, there are better options in Vegas for sure.   I felt like Binion's steak house was closer to Outback than to a Morton's. It was certainly priced like Morton's which was disappointing.",

He gave a meek apology and then asked if I wanted security to come over since this was such an ordeal. Try not to make light of spilling a $14 drink all over the pants of the guy that is paying. Then the manager came over and asked if I was okay, to which I responded yes, but I'm soaking wet. The steak and prime rib was mediocre at best. The garlic mash side was really good though. for $80 a person plus drinks, there are establishments with much better food and service. Would never go back.",

This overlooks the entire city, and although you can't see the strip you can see all the lights and the valley. This is a romantic place you can take your significant other. The service is old school also.  The booths are beautiful and it makes you think who sat here fifty years ago.  The vibe is old fashion Vegas, so it takes a little bit longer to eat, but it is well worth it.   If you are not looking to eat the bar is great also, they have four dollar beers and you can still sit back and enjoy the vibe and views of this historical spot.  The bartender Kevin has been there for thirty years, he is a tough egg to crack at first, but once you do the stories will keep you there all night.   This is a Vegas must!",

Everything is old school, and although you don't have to dress to the nine's, you will want to, because it just adds to the over all experience.  I had the prime rib - which seriously, was bigger than my plate.  My potatoe and veggies had to come on a separate plate.  My Martini was perfect.  The winelist well rounded.  I cannot wait for my next trip to Vegas, just so I can come to Binions.    PS - they are part of the Tix4tonight promos, so you can get dinner and a show at a discount!  Score!",

Craft, Gordon Ramsay's steak.  This ranks up there to those in my opinion.  Sure it's an older hotel but that's what is so cool about it.  We went there for my fiances birthday and the hostess gave us the best seat in the house overlooking the entire Las Vegas valley.  Unlike Giada's Restaurants that seated us in the hallway.  I will never return to that place.  Anyway the staff couldn't have been more attentive and the food was great.  The only negative thing I could say was they need to update their website.  I was wondering how they cold sell a 8oz Filet Mignon with all the trimmings for 39.99.  Well, it was really 59.99 if my memory serves me correctly, but that was fine.  It was comparable to any of the top chefs in Vegas.  Can't say enough nice things about the way we were treated and that's why we go out for dinner anyway.",

It was like stepping back into time reminiscent of all the old supper clubs. The views were amazing and the service was spectacular. Our waiter gave us the history of the restaurant . As for the food my husband got the ribeye steak and I got the chicken Ogden. Our friends got appetizers and sides and thought they were OK. The steak was similar to what we would of had at  home it was tasty but not spectacular. As for my chicken the sauce was good but the chicken was just ok. While the food was not the best we've had it definitely was not bad. So if you want spectacular view great service and a blast from the past I would try out Binion's . Oh yes and you didn't have to buy all of your sides like other steakhouses in Vegas your salad ,potato , bread and soup were included.",

It reminds me of Wisconsin supper clubs but with great views of the city, while some call it old school it is normal to me. The bread and butter they start you off with is really good and they are not stingy with it either. All 6 of us had either rib eyes or prime rib, not a complaint by anyone. Meat was tender and cooked perfectly, I would say they could use a touch more seasoning but a little salt and pepper is all it needed. Sides were excellent as well, I had the garlic mashed potatoes, the other had baked potatoes. Their vegetables this night was sauted green beans, they had onions and peppers mixed in and were absolutely fantastic. Jeffery is an absolute gem, after 36 years their I can only imagine what he has seen! Overall, 6 people with a bottle of wine and 3 old fashions, steak dinners, a unbelievable waiter and the amazing views for under $400. I will come back everytime I'm in town!",

Each steak is served with a baked potato or roasted potatoes. The vegetables change daily and are included. A freshly baked loaf of bread and bottled water comes with meal.

    "text": "Amazing! The minute we walked in we were greeted by the Manager, Donny, very friendly . The Hostess , Michelle, sat us and was very sweet. We were blown away immediately by the service. We had a terrible experience the night before so we were still feeling a bit wounded.. Lawrence, our server, was the best! 30yrs working there , although he looked to only be in his 30's lol. The Scampi and Oysters Rockefeller were a great start. The four of us shared Prime Rib and the creamed corn, was the best I've ever had! They brought over a delicious dessert for our special 91st birthday we were celebrating and all sang! The owner happened to be having dinner there with his family and rode the elevator with us, what a nice man. We told him he should be very proud of his staff !",

Though the glass elevator is currently not working (it was roped off), it was still easy to find and get to.   We arrived on time for dinner and were seated right away. The restaurant was actually pretty empty. There were a few tables but not many.   We were seated by the windows, one off from the corner but right in front. The view was absolutely phenomenal as we were there during nighttime. You could see everything.   We received a breadbasket and butter to get us started. We ordered an appetizer to start to share (Caprese) and it was absolutely delicious. We each ordered a drink from the bar or wine and each was smooth and tasty and paired well with dinner.   Two of the group ordered filet mingion and one ordered the ribeye steak. The Filets and steak were each cooked perfect and came with fresh veg and potato of your choice. The loaded baked potatoes were delicious and very big. The garlic mash was perfectly creamy and garlicky but not overwhelmingly so.   One member couldn't finish their filet and they carefully boxed everything for us. After that they also brought out a dessert with a candle and everything. It was delicious and absolutely perfect way to top off a birthday.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved Binions. My friend was having a major jonsing for a good steak and we were looking for a place that was a little more reasonable then some of the Ruth Chris type places that are located all over the strip. Decided to try Fremont since we planned on hanging there later that night. I thought back to \"The Hungry Detective\" on the Food Network and remembered him going here. Binions was a place I was also wanting to try for a long time. We arrived and there was no wait. We were seated right by a window with a fabulous view of the strip and Fremont. You can't get that view at too many places. The atmosphere was kinda cool, like an old school steak house where Frank SInatra and all the old schoolers would have hanged back in the day. Our waiter was terrific also, very attentive and friendly. Now on to the food, the only complaint is that there were no appetizers that didn't have seafood in them it seemed. My friend is not a fan of seafood and so she was kinda bummed. We both ordered the petite filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Since the menu said you could choose sauces, we figured why not and I chose the Bearnaise and she chose the peppercorn. I was actually very pleased that I could add on a sauce because I honestly don't like to have a steak without some kinda sauce. I love Bearnaise on steak but when I really don't feel like making it, I will just use BBQ sauce. Weird I know, but I have been eating it this way since I was a little girl. I guess when it boils down to it, I am not a huge steak person. I do like a good cut of meat but I never get super excited about it. Anyways, the filet was actually significantly larger than I expected. Honestly, it was the best steak I have ever had in my life! Like I said, not usually a huge steak person so I normally will only eat about half of a filet. However, I ate the entire steak presented to me along with the potatoes which were silky smooth and very flavorful/ well seasoned and the entire bunch of perfectly cooked green beans. My friend hates veggies but she continued to eat the green beans saying that she liked them alot. Did I mention that I ordered my steak medium and this was the first place I have ever been too that cooked it exactly medium? Every other place I have been doesn't know how to cook a steak but this is the exception. The Bernaise was delicious and my friend loved the peppercorn sauce, but honestly, the steaks didn't need the sauces. The meat could hold up on its own (Gosh, never thought I would be saying that!).  Everything from the bread to the meal to the bottle of white zin we ordered was so fabulous that we felt that dessert needed to be ordered, no option, it had to be done! So we ordered the tiramisu to split. Its hard to find a good tiramisu where you can really taste the coffee. This was not only a good tiramisu, it was a great tiramisu. Perfectly moist and had very much the coffee flavor you expect.  Needless to say, we walked away not only feeling satisfied but extremely giddy about the meal we had just devoured.  Binions is terrific in every aspect of the word: Great value for Vegas (how many other upscale steakhouses in Vegas give you fresh hot bread, bottled water, steak, potato and veggie for an affordable price?), great ambiance, and absolutely amazing food! The next trip to Vegas will definitely include a dinner at Binions!  PS: When looking for parking, there is a parking garage where Binions will Validate for up to 3 hours I believe and it is under the hotel if I remember right. When entering the hotel, I would recommend going onto Fremont Street and entering from there. Otherwise, you will walk into a nearly empty poker room that is just depressing and pathetic. That happened to us. It was literally one of those moments where you open the door and everyone stairs at you. Kinda Freaky. I remember thinking that Binions must have really lost its appeal and had hardly any clientele, however, I realized that the other side closest to Fremont street is actually the jumpin part.    ;) One final thing, someone was celebrating a birfday in the next room, and a group was singing Happy Birthday to them. It was the most depressing Happy Birthday I have ever heard. Everyone singing sounded like they wanted to die. Now I am not sure if that was the waitstaff or just the group at the table but it was the most pathetic rendition of Happy Birthday I have ever heard. if that was the waitstaff, they should be ashamed of themselves and step up their games. It was so bad that all the other tables around us including us were all making wisecracks about it. Haha",

You can go up to the restaurant in a glass sided elevator, which is kind of cool and makes you feel like you're exiting the chocolate factory. The wines aren't overly marked up (I usually stick to the same few cabarnets... kind of shocking when there is a $30-$40 difference on the same bottle of wine in the same city), and they can actually cook seafood. I ordered the tuna with the wasabi sauce and it wasn't seared on the edges and missed patches like most places, but actually cooked. While not a cheap meal... with the view and the quality, you can do a lot worse in Vegas. Next time... chicken fried lobster!",

Both were very good, my shrimp wasn't mushy like some other places, and they give you a little plate with horseradish, crackers, etc.  My wife loved her bisque.  I got the NY wih peppercorn sauce,  my wife got swordfish. The steak wsa excellent, cooked exactly medium rare, and very juicy. Not the best steak ever, but very very good.   My wife said her fish was cooked very well, not dried out like it can be sometimes.  Overall, I really like this place. It's a throwback, but I hope they never change it!",

I got exactly what  I signed up for, an old school steak house experience. Honestly, our waiter said he has worked their for 30 years and said countless others have been there as long or longer. All the staff there was very friendly, professional and efficient in their work. The old school vibe was spot on for us, everything we were hoping for. Just had the feel that the Rat Pack was going to roll into the corner booth any minute. We started our meal with Oyster Rockafeller. Holy spongebob was that some good seafood. Can't go wrong starting with this. We also split a Ceasar salad. I'm not one to get to high or low on a ceasar salad but I've got to say this is probably the best i've ever had. That ceasar mix was very unique and tasty and there was a lingering good aftertaste that just kept me longing for more well after the salad was gone. For my entree I had the 16 oz prime rib seasoned just right and cooked to perfection. My wife had the fillet mignon with equally impressive results and taste. I am so glad we went do dinner here. I sincerely hope old school joints like this retain their charm, elegance and great food for many years to come. I'll be back here for another meal next time I'm in LV.",

My mom was a little nervous because of the location but once we got up the elevator and sat at our table I think she calmed down. I ordered wine and my mom got a martini. Both great but just took awhile to get. Steaks and appetizers were great again just slow. Server was friendly but seemed to have several tables. Can't really beat the view and ambiance.",

If you don't see one show or gamble at one casino, go to Binion's ,their NY Steak is so freakin' tender and full of flavor and the Porterhouse is off the chain crazy GREAT. They both are so good, I can't tear myself away to try the Ribeye or Prime Rib, but I've promised myself that I will try the Rib Eye on my next Vegas trip. Oh, the baked potatoes  and salads are meals in themselves also. Go VERY hungry or you won't make through the meal..lol.",

    "text": "Great place to eat and catch an amazing view.  We made reservations for a party of 17 about two weeks in advance and these guys were great.  I dealt with Donny on the phone and \"Team Kevin\" (waiter and assistant were both named Kevin). Everything that was put in front of us was amazing...apps, soups, salad, mains and dessert.  Everything was perfectly cooked, flavorful and well presented.  It's not easy to accommodate a large party, but these guys did it.  If you spent all your time reading reviews on where you should or shouldn't go, you'd never do anything.  This place was \"Old School Vegas\" all the way, I loved it.  I'd give 5 Stars in a second, but there was a problem with the A/C so it was a little warm, (we had a few pre-menopausal women in the party...they don't like a warm room).  The only other critique that I'd make, was the lack of music. I like a little \"background music\" for dinner ambiance.  Kevin said they usually have it on, but didn't that night for some reason.  Anyway, go check this place out, take the waiters recommendations (a good waiter won't steer you wrong), feel the rich history, enjoy the incredible view and taste wonderful food in an atmosphere of a different time in this cool Vegas Steakhouse.      One last thing I forgot to mention...since we had a large party, the tip was already included in the bill.  I didn't see it, (a few glasses of wine, and 46 year old eyes), I tipped on top of the tip, (by a lot of money),  Kevin caught it before we left and he refused to \"keep it\".  You can't beat character, and honestly!",

Where we were seated, there was a large picture glass window with a great view southbound, looking down the LV strip.   Cutting to the chase, the steaks were very good, the salads were OK and the service was fast and good.

Then if you don't touch it and send virtually a complete order of it back you shouldn't be charged ($18 if I recall correctly).

    "text": "Went there on a Sunday night. Have mixed feelings about the experience. The ambience of the place is a bit depressing, being old and dated. (Think red-flocked wall-paper). But the view is spectacular from the 24th floor. And speaking of the 24th floor, it took us four tries in the elevator to actually coaxing it into going all the way to the 24th floor.  They bring out sliced french bread, which was quite tasty. But they serve it with honey butter? Why sweetened butter before a meal. I could understand if they were serving corn bread, but the sweetened butter seemed out of place on the french bread. Also, the bread was not cut all the way through, and there was no bread knife. So you ended up having to tear off your serving of bread, which seems odd for a restaurant that is trying to be high end.  There were two of us. We split an appetizer of crab cakes, which were excellent, and a walnut raspberry salad, which was competent.  I ordered the rib eye medium-rare, and my friend ordered the \"petite\" cut prime rib medium rare. Both steaks were cooked perfectly! But I thought the rib eye seemed weak on flavor and bit more tough than I expected. My friend seemed very happy with the prime rib. But take note, the petite prime rib is 1 pound. It was huge! I had also ordered the peppercorn sauce for my rib eye, but found it totally lacking in flavor. I would not order that again.  The wait staff was pleasant, but a bit inattentive. I ordered a glass of wine, which showed up quite quickly, but my friend's ice tea didn't show up for another 5 minutes. Towards the middle of the meal, I emptied my water glass, which was never refilled. At the end of the email, I emptied my own ice tea (which I ordered after I finished my wine), and it was also never refilled.  With tip, the bill came to $205. Seems a bit high considering all of the above. If you are on the hunt for a good steak, there are other options in town with better ambience and better food and better service, although for a much higher price.",

    "text": "This is a good steakhouse, but it doesn't quite clear the bar set by the best steakhouses downtown.  First, the location:  Binion's is a historic property, but is a little bit dilapidated and a little bit cramped (the hotel portion closed in 2009, so now it is just a casino).  The signature feature of the steakhouse is the view, but it is mostly a view of the other hotels that line Fremont street, some of which are also a bit dilapidated.  The strip hotels are barely visible in the distance.  So if you really want to enjoy a great view with your meal, you might think Top of the World or Voodoo Steakhouse, instead of Binion's.    So, the food:  Good but not great.  My cowboy steak was excellent, and came with a very nicely dressed baked potato.  But my starters of Oysters Rockefeller and Onion Soup were both mediocre.  My wife had a shrimp cocktail, wedge salad, and scallops, and her word for each of them was \"good.\"  My wife is not beyond throwing out an \"excellent\" or a \"wonderful,\" so for her \"good is damning with faint praise.    Our server, Mario, was friendly and helpful.  Everything came promptly.  So service was top notch.  The ambiance was fine, although clearly focused on the view rather than on the interior of the room.  Prices were comparable to most of the other downtown steakhouses.  Our dinner, with one cocktail and a glass of wine each came to about $200.  Access was a little inconvenient - parking at the rickety old garage across the street was cramped, and the elevator creaked.  So, all in all, it was a nice dinner but we probably won't be back.  Next time probably Hugo's, or Oscar's, or Joe Vicari's",

The food is pretty good, but nothing that would set it apart from your friendly neighborhood steakhouse. Other than being near the Fremont Experience, I was pretty put-off by the neighborhood and it was definitely a costly uber/taxi from the Strip.  The steak is good and well priced for Vegas and the wine selection was pretty good. Overall, I had a pretty enjoyable dinner, but nothing that made it spectacular and nothing to make it worth the long trek into the sketchy part of downtown.",

The main elevator on the casino floor was out of order, so we had to use the regular hotel elevator. Once we got upstairs, I realized that the elevator that was out of order is the one that goes up the side of the hotel. The out of order sign that was on the door inside the restaurant looked more permanent so I wondered if it was ever going to be working again. While we were waiting for our table, I was looking at pictures hanging on the wall and saw a picture of that old elevator from outside...it looked pretty cool. The restaurant has the old Vegas feel to it and usually I'm a huge fan of that...but I felt the bathroom could be updated a little. It looked dirty but I couldn't tell if it was just because it's old or if it wasn't cleaned that often.   Our waiter was extremely friendly and gave us suggestions on what to order. I ordered the filet and a huge loaded potato. It was the biggest potato I have ever seen! People walking by our table even commented on how good it looked. Luckily, the potato was filling because the steak was horrible. I took maybe two bites. (that's very unlike me!) For dessert, I ordered warm apple pie and it was delicious!",

    "text": "A nostalgic steakhouse of yesteryear. Other than the prices, sigh, nothing has changed.  Story time: 2002, The WSOP was played at Binion's.  The first year with the stones to pony up the $10k buy-in, and receive the golden ticket to rub elbows and shoot the $hit with the legends of the game.  THE place to eat, Binion's Steakhouse.  The decor is old school, cozy booths, papered walls, wood accents, you know the look, the views of old Vegas lit to its former glory impress.  The food itself, good if you remember this is the classic steakhouse.  Grass fed, grass finished, Australian or Japanese wagyu, dry aged for 11 months in a Himalayan sea salt line room, this is not the place for you. A big hunk of juicy, slow cooked prime rib your thing, now we're talking.  For starters, the standout, the chicken fried lobster. Basically a whole lobster tail, removed from the shell, lightly pounded, coated in breadcrumbs, then deep-fried golden brown.  Slightly overcooked and a bit rubbery but good eats. The chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail with horseradish cocktail sauce and the oysters Rockefeller, both classic and proper.  Finally, the onion soup, very flavorful.  Lots of sweet caramelized onions in a beefy broth imbued with the unmistakable flavor of brandy.  A dusting of parm atop the cheese covered crouton gives it that salty, nostalgic taste.  Steaks, USDA prime, decently trimmed (there is some residual fat but that is a good thing), seared evenly, cooked to temp. Zero complaints about the 16 ounce ribeye or 24 ounce porterhouse.  Very good prime rib. The 24 ounce bone in, very tender, classic prime rib flavor of long slow roasting.  Sides, meant to be shared are classically prepared. The creamed spinach, cream corn, and potatoes au gratin all rich with heavy cream, and exactly as they should be.  Seafood and poultry, yeah right. This is a steakhouse.  Friendly steakhouse proper service.  OK wine list, but weak by steakhouse standards. All good, just drink martinis all night long.  While it does not share the greatness or glory of the Golden Steer, it has stood the test of time, and definitely makes the list of classic Vegas eateries.",

    "text": "OLD SCHOOL! and I mean that in a very good way.  This is the kind of place that has crushed velvet everywhere and is very dark and probably hasn't had a renovation since it was created which was, I'm going to guess, about 50 years ago.  I say all this with love and affection.  We wanted to go somewhere to eat a steak and as we were looking around it seemed like the average for vegas was $40-$50 for a steak with no sides.  We saw that it was $37 for a ribeye with sides, we decided this was the place.    We had cocktails downstairs and played some poker and were waited on by a server with hair that was at least 4 inches taller than her and had been serving there for 25 years.  We knew we were in the right place.  We went upstairs and had martinis and old fashions, the only way to start a steak dinner.  I had the chopped salad and the boy had the french onion soup.  Both were very good and just what you would expect.  We then shared a ribeye which came with fresh green beans  and a baked potato.  Everything was good, the steak was flavorful and the green beans were great.  We had cheesecake for desserts and some coffee.    The only reason we took off a star is that the service was a little weird.  The server would ignore us for other tables for quite awhile, and then just disappear in the back for 20 minutes.  Also we wanted a sauce with our steak and he disappeared before we could order it.  Luckily the steak was cooked perfectly and the it was juicy enough, but it was still a little weird that he didn't ask us about a sauce.  Also the bathroom was very out of date and there is no dress code.  So if you are having dreams of going up there and being kind of fancy, which we did, you are probably going to be interrupted by a group of girls in work out clothes or guys dressed in baggy jeans and white t shirts.    The view is great as well and its worth a trip.  I definitely will recommend this to out of town visitors as the place to go for a steak.",

They had to inquire first and then were happy to oblige. Very Friendly service.  As for the meal two of the four dishes had to be sent back, one was an overdone Pork Chop Porterhouse which they replaced and was spot on.  The Rib eye ordered med-rare was blue, they took a second stab at it, put it in the oven, and brought it back on a clean plate. I guess that's ok ? The other plates were a hit, a NY Strip and a Cajun chicken, which were nearly finished by the time ours returned.  Not a disaster but there are too many steakhouses in Vegas to be coming up short like that, hope it doesn't happen often.",

    "text": "We used to go to Binion's fairly often when I was a kid. But I hadn't been in probably 20 years. My uncle was in town last week and suggested we go there for prime rib. My dad wanted to go to the Cortez Room at the Gold Coast as he was worried that Binion's wouldn't be good anymore and he likes the Cortez Room. I wanted to go to Binion's 'cause I hadn't been there in ages and we go fairly often to the Cortez Room. So I looked it up on Yelp to see what the reviews said. I told my family that Binion's had better reviews than the Cortez Room. So we decided to give it a try.  I'm glad we did. It was the best prime rib I had had in a very long time. The prime rib definitely earned 5 stars.  However, the ambiance left a little to be desired. The tables were too close together and my uncle had a hard time getting to his chair because  it was so close to the next table. Also, my mom had a beam of sunlight in her eye and it took the waiter awhile to figure out how to move the blinds to block that ray of sun. The service in general was so-so.  My wife had the seared ahi tuna. It had been seared a little longer than I would have liked, but she really liked it. It also came with a very good hoisin sauce. My dad got the tuna as well, and really liked it.  Everyone else got the prime rib and raved about it.",

While my wife and I love food, we pretty much stick to the basics. I had the regular size filet, and my wife had the smaller cut prime rib. We also shared a salad. Came with green beans and potato (garlic mashed were delicious). Everything was fantastic. Bill, with tip, was just at $100.00. Desserts looked wonderful, but we were too full to partake.  The restaurant is top floor of Binion's casino. So after dinner, we went downstairs to the casino which opens up directly onto the Freemond Street experience. Great place to walk around and take in some eye candy after dinner.  Was about a $20 cab ride from Bally's on the strip.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to eating here after seeing all the great reviews.  We were a party of 8.  Dinner on Sunday, 4/13/14 prior to my wedding day.  I ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, French Onion soup and the 24 oz Prime Rib.  My fiance ordered the Lobster Bisque and the 10 oz Filet.  I love raw oysters and I love them Rockefeller.  These oysters had way too much sand so they didn't taste very good.  The onion soup was bland, the lobster bisque had too much pepper, the prime rib was so chewy it took forever to eat just one bite and the filet had no flavor to it at all.  If I'm spending $47 on prime rib and $45 on filet, I expect nothing but perfection and melt in your mouth flavor.  A good filet should not make you want to ask for A1 steak sauce to put on it.  We sent back the prime rib (did not want another one), the filet had to go back as well because it was ordered medium rare and arrived medium well.  When we got the medium rare, it was so bland I couldn't eat it.  One of our guests had to send her filet back because it was too well done also and had to send the crab legs back to be warmed because they were ice cold.  So, I'm going to chalk this up to an off night but I won't be going here again.  However, our waiter Lawrence was absolutely fabulous, courteous and did his best to please us.  He was very nice in providing 4 different desserts for the table at his expense.  Hopefully Lawrence can tell management regarding this really bad meal (as he said he would) and improvements will be made.  Feel free to give it a try.  I hope you have a better experience.  I will NOT recommend this place to any of my friends and family.",

DH and I split a caesar salad and 24 oz prime rib with baked potato and veggies. Didn't get any attitude from waiter about the split which is nice. Salad was HUGE as was the prime rib. Took half of it home. All around was pretty tasty.  Friends ordered the lobster and was a 9oz tail. Good thing she didn't order 2 as she was going to! Said was good. Other ordered prime rib also. All were very satisfied with meal. Service was wonderful and personable. Didn't have any issues. Martini's and wine were tasty. You're going to pay but felt it was worth it. Unless someone has a massive appetite, you can split and be more than satisfied.  Would come here again. Like stepping back in time.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is like one of those hoary old ex-burlesque stars you see tarting around Vegas. Just like Dixie Evans and Blaze Starr, Binion's Steakhouse remains willfully oblivious to things like age, fashion and gravity -- what worked in 1960 is still fiiiiiiiiine up here. And what that means for you, steakhouse researcher, is a chance at having dinner in a fabulous time capsule!   I'm not a huge meat eater; to me, steak is steak. Horse, cow, whatever. I've eaten at Binion's a handful of times, most recently last night; the food quality is fine, but nothing exciting -- old-timey steakhouse fare at reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for an 8oz filet).   But the atmosphere is faaaaaaan-tastic! To get here, you have to take an old-timey elevator that looks like it's from the set of Kenny Rogers's \"The Gambler\" to the tippy-top floor. Then you emerge into a dark, clubby room with dingy red velvet wallpaper and floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over Vegas. Very cool!  But the best part is the maitre'd, who can best be described as Larry Flynt meets Liberace! No fewer than 3 gold rings on EACH FINGER, mock turtleneck under vintage 1990 sportcoat, blonde pompadour, and a manner that is somehow both cloyingly obsequious and totally disinterested, all at once. I don't know his name, but this guy is without question one of the baddest-ass relics of Vegas!   As mentioned, I'm not a big meat eater. But I *AM* a big boozer, and I was shocked and appalled to discover that they do not serve Campari up here. WTF! For that, they only get 4 stars.",

Wine prices were much more reasonable than other steakhouses.  The service is excellent, not overbearing but they also don't ignore you.  Water glasses filled quickly.  The view is nice from the 24th floor, and it's a classic \"old Vegas\" joint in the vein of Golden Steer or Hugo's.  The ambiance, history and service may bring this review up another half star.  The blue cheese crusted is a recommended addition to your steak.  The steaks come with a side, which is nice in this day and age of everything being a la carte.  There are certainly better steaks to be had in Vegas, but this place is a classic, and like its older brethren, I recommend everyone try these places at least once.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I have been to Binion's before a few years ago.  The food was great, the service excellent and the ambiance was awesome.  I decided to return there with my parents (whom have never been to Vegas before) AND on Thanksgiving night for the same experience and it was AWFUL!!!!!  Our server (Michael) was devoid of any emotion and seemed like he was incredibly unhappy to be working there (or Thanksgiving night perhaps).  When taking our order, he appeared to be less than enthused that we were there (of which not many people were).  When our food came, he served my mother (the only lady at the table) last.  Having worked as a server myself (and having genuine respect/manners), I know that lady should be served first.  I was kind of surprised - especially for being a high-priced restaurant.  I ordered the 10oz filet mignon  - medium rare (which is what I had last time). When I got it, the first inch and a half were incredibly well done - some pink in the middle.  It was soooooooooo dry!  I couldn't believe it!  $41 for this?   Now I'm not one to usually complain about my food and I can't tell you the last time I sent something back (15 yrs ago maybe?).  I sent it back and the next one they brought out was pink so I thought it was fine.  Towards the middle it was red/purple.  It went from dry to practically still alive!  I don't get it!!!!  This place was incredible when I was there last and for a steakhouse (and at their price point) you would think they could handle a medium rare filet.  My partner had the prime rib which was  an incredibly thick piece of meat, but really fatty.  I was given a complimentary slice of pumpkin cheesecake for my \"wait\" for my second steak which was ok.  The only redeeming quality was Jorge the bus guy who worked his ass off and did considerably more work and was more engaging than our server.  What a huge disappointment for my parent's first dinner in Vegas (ever) and for our Thanksgiving dinner.",

I totally loved the old school feel for the place and the view was second to none. The atmosphere was both romantic and you could picture sitting next to a table of mobsters back in the day.

    "text": "[3.5 stars]  Vegas was packed...with the strip looking like the perfect-feeding/multiplication-ground for a zombiepocalyse that emergency measures were immediately taken to get both the lady and I out...QUICK...before disaster strikes. So zipping away from the strip, she immediately asked where we were headed. GOOD OLD VEGAS was my immediate reply. Pulling her trusty iPhone out, she started looking at destinations to check out. Five minutes later, we were keen on Binion's Ranch Steakhouse as it promised \"great service with a great view over good food\".  The parking lot was unsurprisingly empty and the old-Vegas almost-prehistoric feel permeated the air. Fine...fine...it wasn't exactly PREHISTORIC but definitely a drop (not a leap) back in time. It was a feeling similar to staring at a much-beloved-386 computer (if you're even old enough to know this) after using and getting accustomed to a spiffy-oh-so-hot-and-bank-breaking Alienware or MacBook Pro for several years. Yet, seeing a 386 computer once again doesn't mean I would back away. Rather, just like I used to grab my little box of 5\" floppy disks in anticipation to stuff it into the floppy drives to begin playing DotT (Day of the Tentacle - and if you remember and have played this game...you immediately get an additional Yelp fan who will read and UFC your freaking reviews), I held the lady's hand and eagerly made our way through stale-tobacco-scented corridors to the elevator that would port us up and back in time.  We reached and entered the elevator without seeing a single soul. As the ascent began, the zombiepocalypse image returned. Crap, did they attack old Vegas first and we just stupidly volunteered to become fresh ingredients in their gruesome-human-buffet? GREAT...@#*&^$*&@^#!!!!!!   Elevator door opens and we walk right out to see...a cool-demeanor-well-dressed-gentleman with a smile on his face that immediately implied no such harm has descended upon this area - yet. Of course, that reassuring welcome and asking if we had reservations and such immediately removed all the zombie crap in my mind and refocused my attention to this...nostalgic feeling. Where are we? I almost thought I had grey hair with a backed so hunched that complimented a croaking voice. (Ok, just kidding, I should describe something like Elvis instead...).  Our table overlooked the city in the evening lights. Although, I can't say it was mesmerizing or romantic in the least, we did somewhat enjoy the difference and spent some time pointing and figuring out the area while discussing what it probably was like 30 years ago.  Service was spectacular...and very accommodating. My lady has certain refined preferences with her vegetables and meat (unlike the recycling/food-processing plant that I am that eats everything up and then complains after as necessary) and our server made sure every single part of it was met.  The food wasn't as spectacular as their service and fell in the \"decent\" category. Both the New York and Rib-eye steaks came out done exactly the way we wanted them cooked...the former being medium well and the latter completely alive for the blood craving diner. Steaks were under-salted but that is not an issue in my books as a little toying with the salt dispenser on the table immediately got it exactly to the requirements of our differing palettes.   The overall experience was decent and I would recommend a visit if you (a) want to get away from the overwhelming crowds on the strip; (b) crave a decent steak; (c) want to view old Vegas from atop a building without getting a room; or (d) want to port back to a different era.",

    "text": "First time back to Binion's steak house since 2007 and I'm pretty sure the same staff is there.  The waiter said he had been there for 30 years...must be a good gig.  I met my friend and his wife here for dinner on Saturday night.  I arrived a bit early so I had a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey on the rocks.  The bartender was prompt, courteous and knew the art of a good long pour.  Upon getting up to leave for the table he topped off my nearly empty glass, gratis...very cool!  The ambience is old school, dimly lit, great views since it is up on the top floor and very, very mellow.  It's definitely an older crowd here mixed with some riff raff tourists.  What's shocking to me is they seem to have no dress code...there were guys wearing shorts, t-shirts and a couple wearing baseball hats; at 8 PM on a Saturday night!?!?!? Come on guys, what's wrong with you!  The service was decent albeit there seemed to be some confusion between the kitchen, food runners and servers...food items being delivered to the wrong tables.  Now on to the food: I started with the lobster bisque (which I always do if it's on the menu).  It was OK but I've had far better.  It seemed like they took the bisque with whatever small amount of lobster and whipped it up in a blender; the consistency was weird.  I then had the 8oz filet cooked medium and it came out perfect.  The seasoning was a little on the weak side but overall the steak was fine.  The plate came with steamed green beans which were OK but a little dried out.  My friends wife ordered the crab cakes for her appetizer.  I suggest you do not order these; they were nearly all filler and batter.  For desert we shared a molten lava cake (my friends favorite) and he claims it was one of the better ones he's had.  I thought it was good as well just not a lot of experience with that desert to compare.  I think if they can increase the quality of their food and preparation AND enforce somewhat of a dress code this could easily be a 4 out of 5.  Until then I'm giving it a very generous 3 out of 5.",

It was right by a window, and from the 24th floor you can see all of Vegas all lit up at night.  The waiter joined us shortly after we sat down and took our cocktail order and gave us some explanations of different wines he recommended.  He was very knowledgeable and very polite.  The staff really adds to the cool factor, going back to the old school feel of the place.  The steaks (and meals as a whole) were all perfect.

I always love creme brulee, and Binion's was delicious.  Overall, the experience and atmosphere was soothing. The food was good - not spectacular, but definitely good enough to return if we were closer.

I'd go back if someone else was paying because I've spent my money on the \" experience\". Maybe it's just a personal preference, but I know if better steaks in this city.  A few have told me that it would be much better if Benny was still alive because he would have had the chefs \" tuned up\" in the alley way if he read a review like mine.",

    "text": "I was quite disappointed with my dining experience at Binion's. After seeing a segment about it on the \"Hungry Detective,\" I was sold. It was the Infamous Chicken-Fried Lobster that piqued my interest.  Let me first start with the good things about Binion: The decor and ambience. It had a nice old-fashioned, but high-end steakhouse feel to it. You have to take a glass elevator up the the restaurant located on the 24th floor, the panoramic view of downtown vegas is amazing! That is the only reason why I give this place an extra star.  Food was blah. The Oysters Rockerfeller was a sad plate of food: tiny, overcooked pieces of oysters were thrown onto oyster shells that were two/three times bigger than the oyster meat itself. We even had a couple of empty shells, no oysters just bacon and hollandaise.   Audree's Filet Mignon was overcooked but she did enjoy the garlic mashed potato that came with it. Their \"famous\" peppercorn sauce added for an additional $3 or $4 was mediocre, just a basic cream sauce cooked with peppercorns.  My Chicken-Fried Lobster was also a letdown. I figured there was no way  this dish would disappoint since 1) I LOVE anything lobster and 2) anything fried (and in clarified butter, no less!) is a sure winner in my book. Wrong!   My Austrailian Lobster tail was over-pressed and fried in a thick breading. It was overcooked and tough, looked nothing like what I had seen on H.D.The overcooked tough lobster reminded me somewhat of a fried calamari steak (Verbano's calamari steak is yums btw). It was served with drawn butter in addition to their special \"sauce choron\"....fancy for \"hollandaise.\" No sauce was going to save this dish.   The poor lobster was already dead, they didn't have to kill it again.",

From the 24th floor restaurant, you get a really nice view of the Vegas strip and beyond.  The glass elevator ride up to the 24th floor is an experience in itself.    We started with the shrimp cocktail and the escargot appetizers.  They were both very tasty.  The horseradish for the cocktail sauce had a great kick to it.  My BF sopped up the escargot juice with all of his bread, it was so buttery.  I had the chicken fried lobster and he had the Binion's cut prime rib.  They were both huge!!  The lobster tail they used for this dish must have been ginormous!  The prime rib was supposed to be 24ozs, but we swore it was at least 30ozs!  We shared a creme brulee which was good...not the best we've had, but it was a nice finish to a late night meal.  Waitstaff was attentive without being overbearing and it was a good experience overall.",

After we finished our meal we walked around and looked at the view. I left feeling very very good. The food and service once they figured out we were there was great.  I pretty much refuse to spend $40 on a steak, this might be good if you really want to impress someone. I am lucky to have a partner who likes to share meals so we can try more stuff.",

    "text": "My husband and I chose to dine here the last night as special dinner say good bye to Vegas. I searched to find this restaurant based on good reviews and it's right across to Golden Nugget where we stayed. We are so glad we did. This is by far the best steaks and mash potatoes we have ever had. Talking about the best, we had tried so many high end steakhouse around the world also tried Golden Steer, Gordon Ramsay's, The Paris's, and so on... in Vegas, but Top of Binion's steaks ranged in the top above all those in our opinion. When it comes to good steaks, you don't need Wagu, no need to mentioned 45 days dry aged on menu that kind of stuffs... when they know what they are doing, you know. The service, quality and taste of their steaks blown our mind. Price is very reasonable and I'm surprised it's such a good value considering in Vegas that everything is over the top.   We love old world charm steakhouse and this one feeds our needs. The stunning view and Frank's music make it even more romantic. We were promptly seated at a corner table overlooking Fremont streets and downtown beautiful skyline because I mentioned this is our honeymoon dinner when I booked reservation. They listen.   We ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail to share as appetizer, it was so fresh and lovely.   For the main we both ordered Rib eye (we love Rib steaks wherever we go but they don't have that on the menu. Rib eye is the closest cut without the bone) medium rare. Oh man, the steak was cooked perfectly and the tenderness melt in your mouth like a butter. Did I say the steak also come with vegetables and potatoes of your liking? Unlike most of the restaurants everywhere now of day that you must order \"The side\" to your main course, here already come with. My mashed potatoes with tasty roasted garlic in it, it is out of this world. I finished all mashed potatoes even I'm super full at the time. It's swiped my feet off.   Only recommendation to restaurant is: I wish they have fresh oysters on menu, that would be perfect.   The wine selection is pretty good and the price around $35-45 rang for a full bottle of California wine??! There would be double of the price in Toronto or New York. We ordered a bottle Malbe to enjoy of course.   To finishing a perfect dinner, the restaurant knew this is our honeymoon trip in Vegas, they are very sweet provided us a complementary dessert on house. Even we were very full by the time we finished steaks, we ate it and the lovely cheese cake was delicious.   When I'm writing this review, I already mouthwatering and looking forward to come back.   Hands down, this is one of the best steakhouses in the world.",

I think not.     Once reaching the top floor you are automatically transported back to the golden age of Vegas. No doubt the rat pack, poker champions, and mob bosses once enjoyed the finest Vegas offered at the top of Binion's.   Our group of 10 was seated next to the window with beautiful views of bright lights of the Plaza and El Cortez. Tonight was extra special as the full moon added to the romance of the white table cloth setting. The restaurant is well appointed with the fine details of a 5 star restaurant.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable as demonstrated by his explanation of their finest tequilas and bourbons.  Streaks were on point but were laden with butter. Be careful not to fill up on their fresh baked bread.  I appreciated that the steaks came with a side and vegetable medley.   Pro tip: Don't forget to pick up some heavily discounted Retro Las Vegas ware available in the lobby.",

The view from the restaurant is amazing!  The service was very good, attentive but not overwhelming.  The reason that I'm giving a 3 star is the quality of the steak and the quality is the casino getting up to the restaurant.  The Casino is a mess and appears that it hasn't been remodeled in years. We would have never stepped into the place if it wasn't to go to dinner. The restaurant is older but very well kept and clean.   The French onion soup was very good.  We had the 24oz Cowboy ribeye that was less than 1/2\" thick and extremely tough with mashed potatoes and green beans. Texas Roadhouse makes a much better steak and sides. This week we have eaten at Capital Grille, Cipriani's and Battista's Hole in the Wall all three were much better in quality and value.  Others at the table had the prime rib, which look great but was very dry (cooked medium). Lamb chops (ok) and a couple of the standard ribeyes.   Again. Great service ok food.",

I've also had many steaks on every visit, but this steakhouse ranks highest of my experiences. It's old school & dimly lit which has two bonuses: the views would be affected by bright interior lighting; and, in my humble opinion, I look better in dim lighting. If you know me, you'll likely agree.  My 10 oz. Prime filet mignon was very tender & tasty and cooked a flawless medium rare. My Belvedere martinis were dry and ice cold. Remember, it's important to hydrate when in Las Vegas.  The seafood appetizer was also fantastic, especially the lobster medallions with drawn butter. The horseradish that accompanied the large shrimp was blow-your-brains-out fresh, so I recommend small nibbles of it to avoid sinus pain.  The prices can be found on their menu, but I'd say that Binion's offers quite a value compared to others (such as Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere).",

There is definitely an old Vegas vibe like many others mentioned, with excellent service by everyone we encountered. Started with a cocktail- the sour cherry old fashioned was so good, I decided on a second one instead of wine with dinner. For the appetizer, we chose the oysters Rockefeller based on our waiter's recommendation-very good.  Would definitely order again. We shared a Caesar salad that although was very good, had way too much dressing- would order again just for the Parmesan chip it comes with (so yummy!) and would ask for either the dressing on the side or for a lite amount of dressing only. The main entree was a juicy, tender 24 oz porterhouse steak that came with a baked potato, which again we shared, with a side of sauteed spinach.  I had only about 4 oz of the steak because I was getting full, but my BF finished the rest and said he really liked it. He's almost a foot taller than me with a hollow leg Lol! Although we were very full, we couldn't resist dessert, so we ordered the Creme brulee- a very nice finish to a wonderful dinner! We will definitely come back here the next time we are in Las Vegas!",

Our waiters (sorry I can't remember their names, I wish I'd wrote them down) were excellent and kept all our guests with full glasses and whatever was needed. The food was amazing, we had 3 options on our menu to try and keep the event simple, Rib Eye Steak, Chicken Marsala and Jumbo Shells. Everyone in our party couldn't stop talking about how great the restaurant and food was no matter which choice they had. I had the rib eye with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies and it was perfect, I had a taste of my friends chicken marsala and the chicken was moist and the dish full of flavour, I really regret not tasting the Jumbo shells as well but I hear they were excellent.  They even made us personalised menus congratulating us with our names which we saved as keepsakes! And I didn't even mention the amazing view you have at Binions! By far one of the best dining experiences I've had and I'm not just saying that because it was my wedding day. If you're in the Vegas area, stop by and try them out, you'll be happy you did!

Prices for drinks a refreshing reasonable change from those on the strip. Side note-liquor in bar is organized really odd - makes no sense. Will likely come back and try dinner next time we are in town",

The food is excellent, delicious and heavenly tasty. No matter what ala carte  you order. You would like to try  everything because we could hear from next tables how delicious their foods are. We visits this restaurant almost twice a year for 7 years.  The location of restaurant has wonderful ambiance  and relaxing. And top of it all the staffs are so professional, Donny Wynn the supervisor  were very approachable and server Salvador are very attentive and making sure the food were served properly and food come out in sequence like appetizer to main course to desserts  and never let the glass empty. I thank the server Salvador for a  wonderful experience dining at your Restaurant \"Top Of Binion's Steakhouse. And We will always come back. It's always like a new experience.  See you all soon.!",

Agreeing with another \"yelper\", happy that veggies are included with meal.  If they were located here in MN., we would be there regularly.  The service was impeccable.  Next time, I will remember to reserve our table later in the evening when the buildings are lit up :-).  Thank you Binion's for a memorable evening.  Hopefully we'll be back in December.",

But the gambling hall and this steakhouse are going strong. It is situated on the top floor of the building, so the views are amazing. Top quality steak and fish, the lobsters reside in the tank by the reception desk...until you are ready to eat one.   Drinks are stiff and not terribly expensive, and generally mixed up by master barman Edwin, the consummate professional.   Hope this place is around 50+ more years.",

    "text": "The amazing views and our fabulous waiter, Salvador, were totally a 5 star experience.  It was everything else that was a bit disappointing and the reason for my three star rating.  We started the night with lots of excitement walking in and were having a blast, but before we left the whole table was almost silent... probably out of sheer underwhelment (is that even a word...LOL)  The scallops I ordered had a mushy and stringy texture with no sear on the outside.  I did not expect this kind of quality for a $50 entree.  Initially I was very excited to pay this money and was excited to see what magical creation I would get for this kind of an investment.  I love coming to Vegas for the memorable creations that each chef prepares, but this was not what I expected coming to a gorgeous restaurant like this.    The waiter made some good recommendations for sides, and we definitely all enjoyed the Lobster Mac and Cheese.    When we split the bill, it came out to close to $100 per person which I never mind spending the money for a truly exceptional meal.  My three favorite meals of all time ended up costing me well over $250 and each time they were one of the most incredible dining experiences of my life.  Maybe my hopes were too high.  Maybe my buzz wore off too early.  Maybe I am just being whiny tonight.  But this was not one of my favorite meals of all time.  I hope that I just came in on an off night.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Binions for years, but In a town where Prime Rib for 9.99 is so prevalent, just looking at the bottom line, it's hard to justify every day dining at a place like this.  However, you definitely get what you pay for at Top of Binions.  Not only was the prime rib so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, the ribeye (dry aged to perfection) was so well marbled, tender and flavorful not to mention cooked perfectly to order.   We also tried the lobster bisque which initially tastes rich, but with the chunks of lobster and perfect blend of cream  it went down so easily without feeling full afterward.    The service was top notch! Our server and busser team (Oscar and Octavio) were amazing.  We never had a dirty dish on your table for any extended period of time, nor were our glasses ever empty.  They answered all of our questions about the menu with thoughtful knowledge and a smile.  My niece wanted to try the caesar salad but knew she couldn't eat it all, so Octavio even went the extra step of portioning it out for all three of us to enjoy.  Additionally, my sister and niece decided on the shared plate option but one likes their meat medium rare and the other well.  Oscar, without missing a beat said he would take my sister's half and grill it.  So it came back cooked to order with a beautiful and tasteful char on it.    As we were leaving we asked Don Winn, the manager, about the glass elevator.  He mentioned that it was working the weekend prior to our visit.  We were a little disappointed, so he called it to the top floor, and while we couldn't use it, allowed us to step inside and experience some awesome Vegas history.    All in all, it was an amazing food, dining and sensory experience. Dining on amazing steaks above downtown you could just feel vibe of classic Vegas. The excellent service was just icing on the cake.",

Ordered escargot, Caesar salad (which isn't table side), steak and lobster which I ordered medium rare both came out overlooked, added a side of crab legs which was the best thing I tasted. The mixed veggies were just different colored carrots and they weren't as soft as carrots should be served. Garlic mashed potatoes and rice were delicious. Melted butter was salted, which i couldn't believe. Great ambiance and service. A bottle of Vueve Clicot was only 85$!!!! So I will come back for crab legs and champagne. No fresh desserts, they actually still rock the tray. Supposed to be the best value in Vegas, but there are better. We are spoiled with great steaks living here in Vegas",

The $45 New York Strip I had was tough, fatty, chewey, and without seasoning. I make much better steaks at home. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes from a box. They were runny and tasted old. Terrible. The host and hostess were in the middle of a heated disagreement. Could not have been more unhappy with a meal that cost $150+. I will never go back. Binion's is quite famous. I was looking forward to an expertly prepared, legendary, dinner. That expectation made it worse. I was pretty angry about it.",

The restaurant was fairly busy for a Monday night. Our waiter Pat couldn't have been any more helpful. Cocktails were refreshing and the warm baguette (with honey and sea salt butter) reminded me of a baguette I would find locally! So good! Starters were jumbo shrimp cocktail with freshly grated horseradish and oysters Rockefeller, fresh tasting like the sea. We all ordered filet mignon, cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth. Huge fully loaded potato and an order of creamed spinach were delicious but we did not do them justice as we were starting to get very full. When we mentioned that we were in Vegas celebrating my dear sister's birthday, Pat capped off our amazing dinner with a wonderful piece of triple mousse cake. Truly memorable last meal in Vegas!",

    "text": "So disappointed. This was supposed to be THE steak dinner of our trip to Vegas. I am not really a big steak eater but my husband is so I really wanted to take him somewhere delicious and perfect. This was not that.Yes, there is steak and it tastes good. That is about it.   To start, we ordered two glasses of cava - Freixenet so nothing even sort of fancy which came in twist off splits which the waiter proceeded to open, pour, place the bottles on the tables and the caps. Now, I know when you order a bottle of wine you are supposed to leave the cork so the diner can inspect it to ensure the wine wasn't compromised in the bottle however I am pretty sure there is not a lot of value in inspecting the caps of cheap cava so to start our meal, we were sitting in trash.   We we started with the escargot and a wedge salad which were good. We ordered the fillet and the new york strip. They came with a veg and a choice of baked potato or mashed potatoes. I opted for baked while my husband got mashed. The veg was a pile of greasy green beans and the potatoes were potatoes. The steaks were well cooked.   The real issues were the service, ambiance and the steak accompaniments. It is dark, there are booths and there is a great view (sort of and from some seats) but it isn't warm or cozy or anywhere that I would like to linger. The service is efficient and that is it and the sides are pedestrian at best.   I would probably have rated it a 3 if it wasn't so expensive. The price for what you get is horrible. The cost is comparable to all of the other steak houses on and off the strip and I would definitely recommend going to one of them.",

The meat isn't some kind of hatchet job quality--it is good stuff all the way around.  Yeah, old downtown can be kind of \"ehhhh...  right....\"  but this place is worth it for a good dinner.  About as good a prime rib, T-bone, porterhouse, etc., as you're gonna get.  The place looks like a Sinatra, Dean Martin, Hang out.  Low-lit in the old part of town.  Wood decor and an awesome view.  Maybe better view than the Ghost Bar at the Rio which is close to the strip; how so?  Because this place is in old downtown Vegas and looks South back at the Strip.",

The NY strip that I had was very good, but it should have been more tender.  My friend had the filet mignon and was very disappointed.    The service was attentive and friendly, the views were great from the 24th floor.   Hope they leave the old school decor alone and I will be back again, but must admit that I was slightly disappointed by my visit.",

    "text": "(3.8 Stars) My tour of the vintage steakhouses continue. For those that don't know this is one of the oldest steakhouses in the town and has been kind of the crown jewel of the Horseshoe for years.  As an aside, we here on Valentine's Day so it was probably much busier than a normal night.  Ambiance 5 Stars -- This is the reason you come here.  The room is cozy, with amazing views all around no matter where you are seated.  Dark (not too dark), wood panelling,    Drink -- There is actually a bar in here where you can wait or I presume get appetizers but we didn't go so I can't comment.  The wine list was nice, not extensive, but you can get pretty much all you need.  Surprisingly, the prices were very reasonable compared to other restaurants of this quality.  I was a bit surprised there wasn't a sommelier here, but there could be had we not been on a busy night.  As an aside, I believe you can bring your wine with a Corkage fee, but I forgot so didn't get to test the theory.  Service -- Five Stars -- the staff is excellent, there when you need them but not always there.  The waiter and busser seemed to work quite well in tandem.  Considering we were here on Valentine's i didn't notice any slowdown or lack in service for what was surely a busy night.  Food -- The food if very good.  Compared to the top tier steaks, you'll probaby find a little better but they are also not as fancy as some of the big time ones.  It is nice to receive a side that is included and not a la carte. (Kind of a peeve of mine). Food is going to be fairly expensive, but not to an offensive level.  We had the New York Strip, a Rib-Eye, Oysters Rockefeller and Crab Legs.  Steak was cooked as we asked, Oysters Rockefeller were buttery and bacony, and crab, while not an overly complex thing to serve was done as should be expected.  Conclusion: Definitely a classic, I think you can find slightly better from Hugo's for the downtown classics, but nothing wrong with this.  An extremely relaxing, comfortable evening that I would feel comfortable celebrating any special occasion.",

Propped atop the old Mint casino, Binion's Ranch is a step back in time. The bartender tells us the place is unchanged in 40 years (except Benny Binion punched that hole in the wall over there). The exterior glass elevator is the oldest in Vegas and should definitely be used for your trip back down to street level.  My table enjoyed virtually everything from surf to turf and then some. Everything received unanimous praise from a group of three notoriously bitchy guys.  The atmosphere is definitely old school steak house with huge booths facing the glass walls, red velvet wall paper, and a maitre d' who has been doing his job so long, he may not have noticed that The Mint casino no longer exists beneath him.  I gotta back out one point because I felt that our waiter disappeared after taking our order. A post-meal request for coffee seemed to generate a bit of a huff. One of my companions disagreed. The third, easily distracted by sparkly things, was hypnotized by the street below.  For an excellent, old school steakhouse experience, I can easily recommend Binion's.",

The crab cakes are hefty sized and the bread is so good enough to convert a gluten-free patron. Nothing on draft but a decent wine selection. The prime rib bleeds red and the cowboy ribeye does not disappoint. If you get the baked potato, do yourself a favor and get it loaded. The vegetables weren't anything special. Marsha, our hostess, constantly checked in on us to crack jokes and ensure we were having a great time.   I would come back because the staff created a great atmosphere and the food was excellent. However, if you want a classy, modern-looking restaurant, then this might not be for you.",

From start to finish, the employees were very nice. When we entered, it was a dimly lit restaurant. But you're still able to see where you're going, lol. I was greeted by the host, and told him the number of people that were going to be joining me. I had accidentally given him the wrong number of people, but he was nice and accommodating and changed our seating.   Our server Kevin was great! He gave us the run down of the menu since it was our first time. He answered all questions we had, and he was quite funny. First thing we did was order a bottle of wine and a few non alcoholic beverages. While we were looking through the menu, the staff brought us a loaf of bread and butter. We were one of those customers that night, and had asked for another round of bread and butter.... it was so delicious.   When the server came back with our drinks, we ordered everything. We started with a 2 Caesar salads and shared between 4 people.   For our main courses we ordered 2prime ribs, porterhouse, rib eye, filet, and a side of mushrooms. The meat dishes come with your choice of potatoes or cous cous, and a side of veggies.   Our Caesar salad was delicious, nothing out of the norm. And the our entrees were good. My prime rib wasn't as I expected but I still thought it was delicious. I was hoping it'd be more soft? It was a bit chewy. The potatoes were good, and I added a bit of salt and pepper to my veggies. My sister had a loaded baked potato, it was LOADED. I think everyone was satisfied with their entrees.   Lastly we had desert ! We ordered tiramisu, Creme brulee and I can't remember the last one but it was like a molten cake with ice cream !! Such a great way to end the meal. Everything was delicious. My mom said the tiramisu was too strong but I thought it was just right.   Thank you for the excellent service! I will definitely come again and try other selections on the menu.",

The place has an old school vibe.  I ordered the French onion soup and the prime rib, the BF ordered a Caesar salad and filet. The soup and salad were good, but not great. The meat was cooked well, and had a good taste, but again, not great. I had a loaded baked potato which was good, and the BF tried the Au gratin potatoes which were tasty.  I play the Binions app so I had a 100$ voucher. The total was around 132$. The price isn't bad for a Vegas steakhouse. And again, the view and the service were both excellent. The food itself, while good wasn't the best I've had here in town.  While there are other places I'd recommend before this, it's a solid choice, especially if you're downtown.",

Got a tastey steak meal and a couple of drinks for 2 people for about $100.  Not bad if you ask me.  For starters, you get served some warm sourdough bread - bottomless if you want.  The bread is bottomless, not the servers, just in case you were wondering.  Im a big fan of warm sourdough bread and butter, so I could have eaten just this all night.  But I had to get some steak.  I ordered the sirloin steak, medium well.  I love steak thats seasoned right as I am not a fan of steak sauce and i was happy that no sauce was needed that night!  The garlic mashed potatoes that came with the meal was on fire!  It also came with your choice of greens.   The restaurant was nice and intimate, with dim lighting.   Perfect for date night in Vegas.  The restaurant was on the top floor so you are surrounded by all the Vegas lights while dining.  Its was nice and quiet when we got there on. Friday night, around 8pm.  Perfect to have a conversation at amidst all the craziness and loudness that other Vegas restaurants have to offer.  Not a 5 star steak restaurant but a great choice nonetheless.",

Being a Las Vegas local I was ashamed I hadn't been previously experienced the steakhouse. It was a step back in time to an all glam vintage Vegas! The VIEW...I had never seen Vegas from this vantage point. All the hits of Frank Sinatra played in the background as I enjoyed the best dirt martini with blue cheese olives, honey butter and bread along with the most flavorful and oyster Diane and steak. My heart melted when a chocolate souffle was served with a personalized birthday card from the staff. My mind wandered about those whom dined before me and experienced the same magical service. Binion's is forever my favorite Vintage Vegas dining experience!",

Our drinks were made perfectly (compliments to the bartenders!) and anyone who doesn't take their leftovers home is crazy.   We got the Rockefeller Oysters as an appetizer, and they were hands down the best oysters I've ever had. If you order the lobster you can go and choose your own live lobster for them to cook! The steak cuts like butter! My only recommendation is to order the garlic mash rather than the cous cous as a side. Other than that, this restaurant was worth the splurge!",

Service was spot on, a guy poured our water another guy talked to us about the menu and our waiter Nick took our drink order.  Wife said her Gimlet was the best she's ever had.  We shared the oysters Rockefeller, wife had Filet Oscar and me the 10oz NY Strip. We had another round of cocktails n went back downstairs to play craps about 10:40. Place closed at 10 and I think we were the last to leave.  $166 for 2 before tip.  Would return again",

    "text": "Definitely old school vibe steakhouse.   Greeted by friendly hostess and server.   We paid for the split Filet Mignon dinner and paid extra for the au gratin potato and shrimp scampi.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the bread was delicious.  You could cut the filet with a butterknife.  The baked potatoes are giant and filled with cheese, bacon, sour cream, chives, and butter.  I found the extra charge for the au gratin to not be worth the money.  They were a bit dry and lacked flavor.   The shrimp scampi for the surf and turf add on is $40. 6 very large shrimp in a cream sauce.  I didn't find it to be a scampi sauce because it lacked any garlic flavor or any flavor at all.  I squeezed the lemon on it and added s&p and it helped.   Overall, a very nice experience, but a bit of a let down on food.  I guess if it's been in business for 30 years, not much has changed, except the prices.",

Loved the steak choices,and the fresh vegetables. Immediately greeted by the hostess,and seated  15minutes prior to our reservation. I did our reservation using OpenTable app. Our server was friendly,and explained the side dishes of the evening. All our food was nicely plated,and big side portions. I honestly couldn't finish my 10ounce New York steak. The steaks were cooked exactly as requested. All the staff super friendly,very attentive. Venue is very cozy,and intimate for a nice date. Cocktails were on point. I would definitely recommend coming here. I found myself gazing out the window,as it was such a beautiful,clear crisp night~New Years day 2019.",

This, along with attentive service and classic steakhouse ambiance promises a great meal. I was disappointed.  While the lobster bisque had some nice lobster chunks, the bisque's texture was gritty. I ordered the Filet Mignon (8oz for $36.95) crusted with bleu cheese for an extra few bucks to be medium rare but I received it overcooked. It was more medium/medium well than medium rare. A third of it was stringy and chewy. The bleu cheese crust well-complimented the steak but the green beans that accompanied the entree tasted watery. I expected more.",

Now it seems that although the community surrounding Binions isn't as happening....Binions is. :)  My husband and I had just gotten married and we were in Vegas for a work convention for his business. We were also celebrating my 31st birthday! A year before we were married we visited Binions after reading many reviews about a nice place to go.   The prices here are on the higher end but there is something about old town Vegas that can't be beat. There is so much history within the walls of this place.  Both times we went we had fantastic servers. Both older gentleman who had been around for awhile. They were both full of tips and secrets about Vegas. The last visit we had the gentleman actually shared our wedding anniversary--he was very friendly!  My husband and I both got delicious steaks, baked potatoes and green beans. They brought these miniature bowls with sour cream, bacon bits and butter. The baked potato was cooked to perfection and the steak was so good that we both finished every bite!  If you have transportation to old town and looking for a place full of memories and a place to make new ones...Binions is it!  24/100",

    "text": "I cannot even begin to explain how amazing this place is. Located on the 23rd floor of a hotel in old Vegas lies the hidden gem that is Binions Steak House. The word \"ranch\" is hilly inaccurate for what you get when you arrive.   Also, this place makes a great Caesar, which is kind of a gem in its own right as most places in Vegas don't even know what a Caesar is.   We arrived as a party of 5 and were seated in a booth facing a window which stretches through the entire room and overlooks the entire city. Vegas was at my feet that evening in all it's twinkling glory.   The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and immaculately kept. If it's old, it aged like wine and does not show it's years at all. The fabric of the booths is all red, with tablecloths, linen napkins, and polished flatware. All of the servers I saw were male and extremely well versed in polite conversation as well as when to get lost if the guests are actively engaged in conversation.   This place reminds me of a mob movie. I felt like a mobsters girlfriend and I absolutely loved it, especially the part where Mr. I ordered for me (I had asked him too just for the experience).   He ordered: rib eye with asparagus and baked potato. I was served an 8oz fillet with all the same trimmings. The food was incredible. Perfect rare steak, perfect presentation, large portions but not overwhelmingly so. The wine list was extensive but not so much that we couldn't pick something amazing (a napa gem Mr j took a photo of because of the loveliness of it.)   I would absolutely return. This is the kind of place you take people you love, or someone you plan to have killed in the next scene. ;)",

This is the BEST prime rib you will ever have, it gives \"Lawry's\" a run for the money.  Located at the top of historic Binion's Horseshoe Casino, this place is truly old school and is literally the LAST of the old Vegas restaurants.  When this place finally goes, I am through with Sin City forever (Vegas was only good when the mob ran it)   Those that have no fear of heights should take the old, creaky, wooden elevator surrounded by glass up to the steakhouse, it is a great view of Las Vegas and has room for only 4 people.  During the beautiful but scary ride, one will only be thinking, \"God I hope I don't get stuck in the elevator or that I don't plummet to my death\".  Once inside, the restaurant is darkly light, supplies a beautiful panoramic view of Las Vegas and is decorated with classic red booths.  One will feel as if they are in a mobster film and are about to be \"whacked\".    On to the food, the dish to get is by far the prime rib!  Their prime rib is out of this world delicious and is consistently amazing!  There are 2 cuts of prime rib to choose from: The \"Benny's Cut\" (Named after owner Benny Binion) is a GIGANTIC cut of meat the size of a toilet seat.  The other cut is smaller but still a dinosaur chop!  Your prime rib will come with a choice of sides, I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes.    For those who are not ham hockers and want to eat a civilized size meal, I recommend the lobster tail.  This tail is one of the best I have ever had and I usually will add it to my prime rib to complete my meal.  They claim the tails are only about 8 oz. but they are always wrong, they are so large they are a meal on their own.    They have a good wine list and full bar so no need to worry about finding the right drink to compliment your dining experience.  The staff are all old school and have probably been there since the beginning but this is a GOOD thing.  Being an avid Poker player I always like to hear the stories of the greatest Poker players of our time, as they have all dined here at one time or another.  Players that include Stu (The Kid) Unger, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Moss.  When Binions owned the WSOP, it was a tradition that the winner each year was comped his meal here in the steakhouse after the week long tournament finally ended.   The bottom line is this place not only has a lot of history, but also still delivers an amazing meal every night.  It is one of Las Vegas's best kept secrets for a reason and will continue to be at the top of my list for Vegas restaurants until it closes.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Our reservation was for 6 and the maitre d showed us to our table and acknowledged our anniversary. We didn't bring our own bottle and decided against getting wine. I got a Stella and my wife requested a Mojito but our waiter was quick to let her know that the bartender \"sucked\" at making Mojitos and talked her out of it.  We each ordered a Caesar Salad to start and they came in these bowls that were oddly shaped in that they were very wide on top and narrow on the bottom (contacting the table) that it was nearly impossible to cut the wedges of lettuce into edible portions without the bowl tipping over into your lap. Also there was WAY TOO MUCH Caesar dressing.  My wife went with a 16oz Prime Rib that was served with bone in and a Baked Potato \"with everything\". Fair warning to all that \"everything\" included bacon and cheese which she was not expecting. It was well prepared \"Medium\" and was very good. The crust was super good.  I ordered the 16oz Rib-Eye (Medium) along with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Well first off, it was no where near 16oz and second it just didn't look appetizing at all. It was charred on the outside and when I cut it in half straight down the middle there was no pink what so ever. In fact it was so over cooked that it wasn't even brown in the center, more of a grey.  Now I never send food back to a kitchen. I have seen too many news specials about what goes on back there. But this was not edible IMO so I broke that rule and sent it back requesting a new one. Oddly though I had 2 different people come and ask what was wrong and if I wanted it well done or something, as if they thought I was complaining that it was undercooked. So 3 different people were informed that I wanted it medium.  The waiter returned a short time later and let me know that if I wanted a new one that it would be 15-20 minutes and asked if I would like to change my order to something that would come quicker since my wife was already enjoying her meal. The first thing that crossed my mind was \"if you are spending 15-20 minutes cooking a steak to medium, you are doing something terribly wrong. I then agreed to change my order to the Prime Rib since I had a few bites off my wife's plate and it was very good.  Mine though came out a smaller/thinner cut than hers and without the bone. It was also much more of a center cut so I got very little of the awesome crust that was all around hers. It was tough and just not good. I suffered through it though and ate the thing. The Garlic Mash on the side was OK but not anything better than I have had at Sizzler.  They did bring us a complimentary dessert and again acknowledge our anniversary.  Bottom line is next year we will be back at Texas de Brazil. Why mess with something that works. We will never go back to Binions Steakhouse. I would have been much happier at the Buffet in The Fremont across the street.",

The portions were perfect to fill two hungry people.   The server, I wish I remembered his name, he was awesome.

    "text": "Binion's is a classic steakhouse from a bygone era in Las Vegas, located at the top of the old Binion's Hotel and Casino.    I'd be inclined to rate the restaurant as perhaps 4+, were I to base the review solely on the ambience, quality of food, and service, all of which are quite good.    The Good: As I was not overly hungry this evening, I ordered the french onion soup and the crab cakes horsdervs.  Both were quite good; and I will single out the crab cakes as especially great.  Wonderful flavor, plenty of crab meat, and perfectly pan-fried.  The soup was fine, as was the warm, soft bread.  I also sampled my date's prime rib, which was pretty much perfect.  Quality meat, cooked attentively and seasoned well.  The ambience is great; it harkens back to a slightly more civilized era...an era when high end restaurants were quiet, dimly lit, intimate affairs.  Today's more modern places seem to instead aim at making diners feel like pseudo-rock-stars, with loud music, high ceilings, and a general emphasis on trendy bling.  It struck me how nice it was at Binion's to simply be spared pulsing techno music and patrons that have to be shout to be heard over the dull roar of the modern dining environment.  As others have mentioned, the view is also great, and the service is attentive, professional and unobtrusive.    The Bad: The unfortunate fact is that Binion's Steak House is a high-quality restaurant sadly shoe-horned into a not terribly attractive casino and hotel that has not been updated or remodeled in the last 25 years.  The elevator feels creaky; lights on the buttons often don't work.    But perhaps worst of all was the shockingly awful bathroom.  It's quite jarring to have a wonderful meal one moment, and then the next moment to find oneself in the sort of bathroom you'd be more likely to find in a Greyhound bus depot.  Faucets are semi-functional and leaking, water is on the counter and the floor, and the toilet paper dispenser is the sort you'd expect to find in a rural gas station someplace, complete with a flopped-open case-cover which cannot be closed.  The bathroom was in need of good cleaning, smelled pretty foul, and basically created the sort of gut-level revulsion you can usually only find on remote interstate rest-stop toilets that have neither been cleaned nor properly remodeled since the Carter Administration.    Why in the world such relatively minor details and minor expenses would be overlooked by a restaurant that is otherwise creating a fine-dining experience is beyond me.     The Conclusion: This is a great restaurant, and a refreshing step back in time.  One can easily imagine Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin or Elvis Presley relaxing with friends over great food here as they look out over the Las Vegas skyline of 1968.  And for the quality of the food and service, it's also reasonably priced.  While not remotely inexpensive, the truth is one would quite literally pay double the price for this quality of food were one to eat at one of the trendier steakhouses located on the Strip.  So really, it's a great place.  Just don't go to the bathroom, and try to close your eyes on your walk thru the casino and your ride up the elevator.",

    "text": "Yeah, it was okay. Probably won't go out of my way to get back here though.   The goods: The view was great. Our party was seated in a corner so the two views were even better. The decor is great, a real old school throw back feel. Hmm, what else, that's about it. The lobster bisque was fabulous.   The not so goods: The service was just weird. One minute there are three staff huddled around the table, 20 minutes later they're completely disappeared. I had the Chicken Fried Lobster. Obviously this sounds really good...but it just tasted like chicken. It resembled one very large chicken nugget but without the hot mustard. I could have saved an awful lot of money by going to McDonald's instead. Girlfriend had a steak and forgot to order any sort of sauce on it. It really didn't taste like much. I was pretty glad that it didn't show up on my plate.   Not really sure why I'm giving the 3 stars. I guess we had a good time and that's really what it's all about.   Overall I'd say save your money if you're on Fremont Street and go to Mermaid's for a fried Twinkie and a hot dog. Oh and don't park in the Binion's garage, what a fiasco!",

This is the quintessential old school steakhouse! We were a party of 6 and got and awesome swank booth with an even swanker view!  Lucky for us nobody else seems to know about the place- we practically had a wing to ourselves.    I started with the escargot- WOW!!! Never thought a crawly thing could be such a butterlicious thing of delight! Could have eaten 'em all night. Unlike the previous poster I thought that the french onion soup was amazing- not to salty, thick with onions and the crispy cheese was PERFECTO.  They also let me \"build-a-salad\" and create a combo to my specks that was not on the menu.    Hubby got the king crab w/ drawn butter, good, but save your $$$ and get them at the Wynn buffet- Binion's is all 'bout the steak.   Unlike many an \"upscale\" restaurant, the portions generous, as in take it home, rather than tiny, as in pass the bread basket. Refreshing for a gal that likes to eat.   Maitre D was amazingly fun, bought us all after dinner drinks and desserts. We shut the place down and were feelin' real good afterwards. The perfect Vegas experience.   I will remember this place always and look forward to returning!",

Mimi's French onion soup is far superior to the soup served here, and we've all had that.

    "text": "My friend spoke of only one thing over and over again in Vegas, and that was this restaurant.  We finally get around to it on our last night there, and it was worth it.  The first thing that stands out is the genuine service.  No force pleasantries or idle chatter.  When they come up to your table to check on you, you get a quick question and a nod and then they're on their way to leave you alone.  They've been there a long time and they know what they're doing.  The second thing that stands out is the great food.  For starters I had the shrimp scampi - jumbo shrimp in a garlicy wine sauce that mopped up with my bread.  The rest of the table each got the lobster bisque, which was pretty much devoured after a few minutes.  I ordered the rack of lamb, which was tender and flavorful.  The ribeyes my friends got looked and tasted fantastic.  There was really nothing on our plates that didn't get eaten - including the mystery vegetable that everyone asks about.  For the miscellaneous, the view from the top floor is great at night, being at one of the highest spots in downtown Las Vegas.  The value is decent - you'll get full for your money.    I really didn't think this place would match up with Hugu's Cellar (which I really enjoyed), but it surpassed my expectations.",

When I order prime, because I was burned more than once with day old reheated or nuked, I tell the waiter that if this is dry, firm and non juicy, I am leaving. Well, when your paying $50.00, in a famous steak house, you don't need to ask.  Right? Shame on me! It was not juicy.  It was the color of medium rare, but a day old.  And, we ate half, paid up, and left. Good potato.  Great view. Professional staff.  They duped me. This place is well past its due date. In closing, we went to the El Cortez last nite.  $11.98 prime rib.  Shabby dinning room.   Dark.  Odors.  Staff that are past there due date.  Except the young guy who presented your dinner.  He looked like some of the homeless I see waking up in the alleys.  He wasn't dirty, or smelly.  His cloths and grooming suggested that watering wasn't his occupation. Fantastic prime rib.  I was gobsmacked!  We're going back tonite.",

My wife and I ate here last night, the waiter began our experience talking about carrots- what? No pitch about great steaks, just sides. It told of things to come. Next we got the arugula salad, a nice plate with raspberries and hazelnuts. A bit heavy on the dressing but a good choice! Went downhill from there...   We got the fried lobster as an entree, just way too much breading so it hid the lobster flavor. Our $52 New York steak was covered in blue cheese, looked perfect on the outside. But you could barely cut into it and the meat had no juice- tough and bland. We shared both entrees and my wife did not take a second bite of the meat. The waiter was clueless when I said the meat was tough but we did hear a similar complaint from the table behind us on entering. Too bad, the view was great, martinis well crafted but the food sucked!!",

You get a great view of the plaza hotel and surrounding areas while on the 24th floor. Drinks were always served promptly and made well. Wait staff was on time with everything and never felt like we were wondering when stuff would arrive. We all got some sort of steak/salad meal with veggies and potatoes and no one had any complaints. The vibe is very dark lit and red everything. Large booth areas good for parties from about 2-8 comfortably. If you're looking for a modern chic place this is NOT it. But if you want to feel as if bugsy seigel is sitting behind you then you have to be here. Dress was between business casual to more formal attire. It was never too loud or feel like you can hear other's conversation. We had so much fun and probably make it a point to come back again next time.",

    "text": "This place was an old favorite...until recently.  This steakhouse used to be a good spot on Fremont. But as with most things on Fremont, it has seen better days.   I'm struggling with my choice of stars: on one hand the restaurant deserves 3, maybe 4 stars (on a good day). But the casino experience drags this down to a 2 star review. I decided in the middle with a 3 star rating... you can decide. This experience is based on a Saturday night visit with a 630 dinner reservation.   Casino: 1/5 stars. We entered the casino through the rear entrance (not under the canopy). This doorway used to be the valet, which the casino has since shut down. This area used to also be bustling with poker activity. Overall ambience: there were hardly any people, very little table games going, and the smell of smoke was distinct. Just past the former valet doorway were racks of tee shirts for sale. It was odd and out of place, and gave the feeling of a swap meet. Truly not a high end experience. When we left, we went out the main doors that exit to the canopy area. There was a table set up with someone selling cigars for $7-$20. Another cheap feel for a formerly decent joint.   To get to the steakhouse, there is a dedicated elevator which takes you to straight to the restaurant. This was out of order, apparently permanently. So we took the guest elevator. Not a deal breaker, but another sign that this place is going downhill fast.   Steakhouse: the prices were approx $50 for a steak with a side. The beers were surprisingly cheap ($6 for bottles coors light). The view is awesome. And likely what you are paying for.   Food: I ordered the ribeye with baked potato. The potato was loaded & delicious. The steak was okay, not superb, but not bad either. For the price point you can get a better quality steak elsewhere. For an app, I order the escargot- which was great. This would be the only reason I come back.   Service: the service was good. I went with a group of younger people and they weren't judgmental considering. I respect that, as you never know who your patrons are.  The staff was attentive and brought complimentary desert to our guest of honor.   Bottom line: There's better steakhouses for the price point, but the food is okay nonetheless, particularly if you're already downtown.  The casino is in pretty poor shape, so if you're looking for that experience with your steak, look elsewhere.",

The atmosphere is  just like your rude aunt Becky is decorating the place.  Binion's website, Yelp, and Open Table all state business hours until 10:30 pm.  That's True I guess.  We made reservations for 9:30 pm via Open Table.   At 9:39 pm, we were instructed to place our order within the next six minutes.  We were definitely  finished and check paid by 10:30 pm sharp, just as instructed.  I think the Swedish Chef from the Muppets owns the place, that's the only way this would happen.  The employees were very polite while giving us our timeline. On a separate occasion I have been turned away after 9:45 pm.",

As I sat and enjoyed my cocktail it was clear that many of the customers were here for the first time as was I and it was also clear that some were here because this is their go to steak house whether that's because of the reasonable prices, the atmosphere or the steaks cooked up on the well seasoned grill that has satisfied generations of gamblers, entertainers, or just the locals that never ventured far from the strip.  Decision time I wanted to keep it simple a wedge salad, baked potato with butter and a giant juicy medium rare rib eye steak no fancy sauce or grilled veggies just rub a little salt and black pepper on both sided and let the flame lick it done throw it on a plate and bring it to me hot and juicy. I wasn't disappointed my server wasn't the best and was mostly pre-occupied with a few of the female servers I didn't care because he didn't factor in my opinion of this place.

We have been here a few times over the years and I think what keeps us coming back is because it still has that nice feel to it of a romantic, classy dinner place,  Sitting near the window is really nice at night to see the view. We really enjoy the ambiance here. I have always ordered the Lobster Bisque soup when I have been here. It has a really nice flavor with chunks of lobster in it and topped with cream always very good. We always get one of the Rib eye steaks.. Always a great flavor and so big! They are like a 1lb each!  I never finish mine and always have a doggie bag to take home. The garlic mashed are very good we always choose them. You can pick from a baked potatoe or roasted or you can get risotto, The bread is always so good too my husband always wants more,  We have never had a problem with service from the moment walking in to being seated to leaving. Everyone is usually always friendly and accommodating.   Have never had dessert because we are always so full, or maybe in his case full of bread lol  We recommend if your looking for a nice place to go down on Fremont street head here inside of Binions... It is a older casino and restaurant but that is what I like!",

Service was attentive, a decent menu heavy on beef of course, but just not there, esp. for the prices. Prime rib chewy and while admittedly we were a larger than average party to serve, a cold piece of prime doesn't cut it.  Much better choices in Vegas for the price.",

Our server Mario was fantastic, as was his helper Jonathan. I had a fabulous wine which he recommended. My husband wished they had a larger selection of craft beer, something local would be nice. I loved the warm bread and butter that was brought out to start. My husband ordered the French onion soup, which he liked. I started with the Caesar salad. It was large and fresh. It came with a giant piece of baked Parmesan cheese which was a great touch. I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes. The current vegetable was carrots which I am not crazy about, but these were cooked well and I was happy to see yellow and purple carrots also. My filet was cooked perfectly medium rare and came with a butter sauce on the side for dipping. It was excellent! My husband ordered the 16oz Prime rib with loaded baked potato. He loves prime rib and usually orders it whenever we go to a high end steak house. He said this was in the top 5 of the best prime rib he has ever had. He appreciated the straight horseradish that came on the side. He likes to mix it with his jus like wasabi in soy. As an added treat they brought me out a complimentary birthday dessert. I thought there was no way I could eat it as I was so full. However, it was perfect! It was a raspberry mascarpone with fresh raspberries on top and a lit candle, which was such a nice touch! We will absolutely be back here the next time we are in town. Coming from Nebraska, I know my steak, and this place knows what they are doing and for a reasonable price!",

Be aware that you will get charged $25 per person if you cancel your reservation the day of. Total BS! It's about time I take my money elsewhere.

Lobster Bisque was thick and tasty, with good lobster flavor.  And, French Onion Soup was hot and very tasty, with Mozzarella Cheese.    My entree of Filet Mignon was buttery and perfectly medium rare as ordered, accompanied by a very good Spinach Salad that contained egg and Hot Bacon Dressing.  Lobster was slightly sweet, and Roasted Red Potatoes were excellent.  So were a creamy Bearnaise Sauce and Cabernet Sauce.  Carrots were prepared al dente.  Rounding out what was consumed by my party of four, Grilled Salmon and a medium-well Butterflied Filet were both pronounced good by friends at my table, but unwelcome spinach juice from Sauteed Spinach ran across one diner's plate.  Service was generally excellent, but ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes were initially left off a fellow diner's plate.  One oddity was that Coke and Diet Coke were served in diminutive bottles.    As a distinct bonus to fine food, from our table we enjoyed an excellent rooftop view of downtown and the valley floor below.  Because we had a play to attend at the Smith Center, there was little time to order dessert, and we were all too full anyway.  4-1/2 stars overall!  I plan to return soon for a more leisurely meal.",

The hubbster had been here before and always had a great dining experience. This was my first time, and I felt there was something lacking.. lets dish why..  As far as the ambiance of the place, its very romantic, stylish and vintage Vegas. I can picture the Rat Pack having drinks in a corner booth, or maybe Wayne Newton having some Filet Mignon at the next table. The view of the Fremont area below and the Vegas Strip in the distance is beautiful and a great scene while dining.   The staff is friendly and attentive, and the service was great since they knew we were kind of a \"wedding\" party, given our attire, but the food on the other hand seemed bland and not too tasty as I expected. I had ordered a wedge salad which was fine, and then the filet mignon at medium, which it was medium pink, but still had well done bits close to the end. The veggies had no salt, which I added some, and so the wine seemed to be the best selection of the night. It wasn't unpleasant enough to complain, since the food was hot and smelled great, but for the $$$ for what we paid, I feel it was not worth it.   Perks: Gorgeous views of the city. Good wine selection. Steaks and seafood on the menu. Nice spot for a date night.  Downsides: Pricey for hit or miss entrees.   OverALL:  A-OK. Might have to take a gamble at this. Not bad, but not amazing either. Its worth a try if you are a steak lover.",

We walked in about 4:55 and our reservations were for 5:00. It was a little awkward at first since it was just the beginning of dinner service. No other guests were there which was fine. But there were about 3 employees just staring at us and we walked up and it was dead silent. The silence made it even stranger. But we were shown to the bar, had a couple of drinks and brought over to our table.   Yes, what this place has over most other steakhouses is the amazing view. Being there while the sun was setting was absolutely perfect. We finished our drinks while whispering to each other as it was so quiet it seemed as if others would be able to hear us.   After a drink and finally deciding what we wanted we ordered the escargot, filet mignon and 16oz prime rib. Music came on, other guests came in and the restaurant finally started to have a bit of a buzz.   We plowed through the escargot which was delicious and received our entrees. They were both cooked an excellent medium rare. My only complaint would be that the prime rib was a little cooler than it should be. But other than that, the food was fantastic.   Service, food, atmosphere were all great.  Will probably return in the future. Would recommend to local friends or those visiting.",

The good: the views, the cocktails are huge and well made, the wine list is actually pretty good and reasonably priced, the wedge salad is great. The bad: I don't think they know how to cook steak. My ribeye - which was quite pricey - had little flavor and was sadly over cooked. How does a steakhouse not know how to cook a steak medium rare?? And not know how to properly salt a steak? I made a ribeye at my house a few weeks ago that was much better than this, so was expecting more wow factor ( and flavor) for the price. So while it was a fun night out with friends, it is sadly not worth the price (it's not worth half the price to be honest).",

Last night, we had a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre and I had some comp dollars from Binion's, so we finally made it here.  I hadn't been in the restaurant since it was known as Top of the Mint many years ago.  As others have said, it's a classic steakhouse and you have a great view.  We were there early and enjoyed our time looking out the window and picking out things we didn't know were around the area.  For the meal, we each started with onion soup.  It was good with a hearty beef broth and tasty cheese.  I ordered the 10 ounce NY steak and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet.  It came with choice of starch--we each chose the garlic mashed potatoes--and seasonal vegetable which last night was yellow and green squash.  Both steaks were tasty.  Mine was done a bit to much.  It should have been rarer but it wasn't egregious enough to send it back.    For dessert, we took a look at the dessert tray brought by our waiter, Jeff, and we opted for the same dessert, a chocolate volcano--a small bundt cake made of chocolate and filled with heated chocolate.  It was very good.  A couple of things to note.  Service was very good.  Jeff has been at the steakhouse for a number of years and he's a good server.  I never wanted for a refill of my iced tea and the bus people were there to remove dirty plates when a course was finished.  The view is as good as everyone points out.  I enjoyed being there while it was light because I could pick out more places.  We were long enough that we could see the lights of Fremont Street start to glow after sundown.  For the price, I think there are other good options for steak in Las Vegas at a comparable price.",

We chose between Binion's an another establishment that was supposed to be good and a little pricey.  We chose Binion's because of the view the reviews spoke about.  We truly enjoyed our visit here and will go back in a heart beat.  We had the best waiter (can't remember his name now, but he paced the meal just right and offered suggestions when needed).  The food was phenomenal - lobster bisque had chunks of lobster and was the right temperature.  My husband and brother in law ordered steaks and they both left with half of their steak not eaten.  The portions are large and the food was cooked to perfection.  I ordered the dungeness crab legs and they came sliced so I didn't have to get all messy - also came with drawn butter - I couldn't even finish all of the crab because I had to save room for the dessert.  The only negative is that my brother in law specifically asked for a nice view so we could celebrate in style and we had the view of a wire fence and building - not quite what we were hoping for.",

We decided to try this restaurant as we had some comps to use. We walked in without a reservation and were immediately sat next to the window with a nice view of Fremont Street and beyond. Our waiter William \"Bill\" was great. He was very personable and provided great service.  My prime rib was cooked perfectly at medium plus. The horseradish was the spiciest I have had in a long time and am bummed I forgot to ask where they got it from. My wife had the New York and hers was cooked to her liking as well.  The carrots were cooked just as I liked them, not too crunchy and not to soft. Mashed garlic was on point, especially after I mixed horseradish with them. The finale was the mousse which was light and tasty.  We will definitely be back. Especially since we told Bill we would be returning again.",

Food was okay, good not great.  We had the ribeye and new york.  Both were cooked to what we ordered but was tough and the new york was on the thin side.  The crab cakes had a lot of bread crumbs and was ok.  The ahi tuna appetizer was sent back because the tuna was cooked all the way.  They did replace it with tuna that was pink in the middle.  Not impressed.  The french onion soup was the done well but the lobster bisque was on the watery side but had large chunks of lobster in the soup.  A little pricey for the quality of food, must be paying for the view.",

    "text": "This is definitely old school vegas with a view.  Unfortunately as with most relics, the food also reflects the age, and not in a good way.  If you are looking for old vegas charm with an okay meal, I think the nostalgia and view of this place will win you over.  For me, the meal and service was far lacking to make up for the setting to make it an enjoyable experience.  The Binon's Horseshoe casino has definitely changed since the 90s when I remember being here last.  No more dark and smoky rooms (and I mean thick layers of smoke visible in the lower atmosphere).  There's much more color and updated lighting.  But once you step into that glass elevator to the 24th floor it's like your own private time machine.  Especially since there is no AC, your on the outside of the building facing south, and you age whole 10 years by the time you reach the top...  Your greeted by \"Vinny\" and the first thing you noticed that every one working was male (at least that night), definitely old school \"Mob supper club\" feel.  The view is not to shabby, little bit of downtown drab but you can see clear to the strip.  The service wasn't that exciting and I cautiously opted for the Chicken Fried Lobster.  I figured you can't go wrong with Lobster and frying it just seemed right.  I think if they fried it in butter it might have been better but this dish just didn't do it for me, the breading just seemed to mask the flavor too much and they even served it along side a dipping sauce, which was too over powering on it's own.  Others in our group went for the Steak which was ok,  The quality of the cut was better than what you get at Outback and you could definitely tell it was grilled over a good quality fire but it was lacking something.  I'd return if someone wanted an old school Vegas experience but unlikely to return for the food alone.",

Unless you like looking at the top of other casinos or a parking garage, I have no idea what people are referring to when they say the view is amazing. I asked for a filet-- medium- it was mooing on the plate. Had dinner for two- steak/lobster, two drinks, two desserts, coffee- $225.00 before tip. The food was 2 stars out of 5, way way way overpriced. Bread was warm, but old and stale. Wait staff spilled water all over out table, then said \"Oops\" . I live in las Vegas, so it is truly sad that I can not refer family and friends to this location. And, of course, I will not be back.",

On nearly the top floor of the Binion's Casino and Hotel you can find a wonderful steak house in the heart of downtown Vegas.  Sure, you can go to another steak house du jour along the strip and be treated like a piece of meat or you can come here and enjoy one.  When the elevator door opens on floor SH (Steak House), prepare to step into a time machine whisking you back to the early days of Vegas.  A maitre d', classic dark dimly lit decor and red vinyl booths will welcome you.    The Prime Rib was delicious and the Caesar salad was yummy.  My only suggestion for improvement was the dinner rolls were a bit dry.  Other then that, the Binion's Steakhouse was simply a classic experience and a nice way to escape the crowds.",

So, I've been here a few times, so I think I didn't have an unfortunate bad experience.  I know my steaks, having been to several high end places across the country.  The view is great.  That's about it.  Service has been terrible every time.  Servers have a mafia attitude and are the most snobbish of all of Vegas.  This was for every time I come here.  Then it took forever to get our appetizers and then our meal.  Then the steak.  Aged.  And it taste like it.  Seems to have a spoiled after taste and was tough.  Every time.  I guess most people pay a high price and need to rationalize that they got a great meal.  Then the price is higher than most quality steak places.  It took a few years to convince my friends to try some place different.  Now they agree with me that other places are much better.  I expect for the price to get superb service and a great steak.  I haven't seen it here yet.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place a VERY generous 3 stars b/c of the view....it was really nice! =) And the music was great! They are lucky they had that going for them b/c the rest of it...not so good.   My husband and I checked out the menu online before our trip and basically decided on what we were going to get. We also checked the dress code, which stated \"business casual\". I wore a dress (I NEVER wear dresses) and my husband wore a suit jacket and a nice button up shirt with nice slacks. We walked over to Binion's and finally found the correct elevator after asking a few employees, and made our way up to the top. No glass elevator. =(  Everything was going good thus far- the maitre d (this guy was wearing a ring on every finger, he looked like an old school mafia boss or pimp lol) seemed a little smug, but we were expecting that since this was supposed to be a nice place.   In our reservations I stated that this was a special occasion and asked for a table by the windows if available. They accommodated us with this great table right next to the windows, kind of off by ourselves. Great view, great music, no one directly next to us, everything was perfect so far. Our waiter started off great, but we didn't actually see him for the rest of our meal until he brought the check - more on that in a second. I ordered the petite filet and my husband ordered the chicken fried lobster, since they are supposed to be famous for it. Remember me saying we had looked at the menu beforehand? Well they need to update their menu prices online. Everything was like $10 to $20 more on their actual menu than they had quoted online. I know inflation happens, but come on...update your website! Money wasn't an object, but still, UPDATE.  A few minutes after ordering, a loud table of 4 was seated right next to us....there were a ton of open tables a few feet away, why couldn't they have gone over there?! They were not busy so I don't think it would have been an issue for our section's waiter to walk an extra 4 feet. Anyway, the loud table was sat next to us and they were all dressed in motorcycle tshirts and old jeans, with baseball hats. I noticed a few more tables coming in with ratty looking tshirts and holey jeans. I think we were the only table dressed up! I am not a snob, people can wear whatever they want, but I put on a dress and heels b/c it was supposed to be business casual, so I think they could have come in with a freaking polo shirt on or something! And the snobby maitre d didn't say anything....maybe they tipped him, who knows. Ok, so the loud table next to us all ordered water, and they managed to get better service from the wait staff than we did - we ordered drinks. I heard what they ordered (how could I not) and our 2 person check was going to be more than their 4 person check, and our waiter was kissing their asses. As I said before, we only saw our waiter when he took our order and when he dropped off the check. We didn't get a refill until my husband tried to refill his water himself (they had giant bottles of water sitting off to the side) and out of the 3 waiters / workers we saw walking around, no one asked how our meal was. They sure as hell asked the table next to us how everything was, multiple times.   On the the food: the filet was burnt...charred severely. I asked for medium, not black. It didn't even taste like a filet, I think they gave me the  scraps from someone else's steak. The potatoes were the best thing on my plate sadly. The house salad was drenched in dressing, which would normally we fine, but there was so much that I couldn't finish it. My husband got the caesar and he seemed to enjoy it. His chicken fried lobster was gross. We've both had better fried seafood from Long John Silvers or Red Lobster. The lobster itself was just not good. My husband will usually push through something he doesn't like, b/c he's paying for it, but he wouldn't even finish this dish.  I told him to send it back, but we would have had to see a waiter for that to have even happened. 20 or so minutes went by with us sitting there waiting for a waiter to come back to ask how our meal was. Neither of us had touched very much on our plates, that should have been a sign to the wait staff that something was wrong. Clue number 2 would have been us looking around for someone that worked there. I'm serious, if the mafia looking maitre d had not been outside we would have dined and dashed, it was that bad.   We stayed and paid, and gave a fair tip (even though we shouldn't have given our waiter anything b/c he didn't DO anything) and on our way out we passed 2 employees and the maitre d....no one said 'thanks for coming in', 'enjoy your night', 'kiss my ass'....nothing. We will not be back. I am big on service and this place SUCKED big time.",

    "text": "Although not the best, it is still good to see the place every time that we are in town -- downtown, that is.  Food is consistent, drinks are made stiff, staff is helpful -- although there have been a couple times where they disappear for a while leaving the patrons to look at each other like, \"hey, you, table 15, I need some water over here...\".  The view, thanks to the Nugget's expansion, is not as great as it was looking down toward the strip, but looking east is still a treat.  Love the view form the top!!!  Old school Vegas with dark decor, waitstaff in black suits, meat and potatoes as the main staple, and a nice wine list.  If you haven't ever been, it's worth it to give it a try.",

    "text": "Awesome view!  Good food and our waiter was very nice and accommodating.   I asked for a drink that I came up with myself and the bartender did an awesome job with making it.  My prime rib was huge and I ordered the smaller size.  The prices were right in line with other steak houses.  And at least you get some sides with your meal here.  Other places make you pay for the sides.  I think the only complaint our table had was how hard the bread crust was.  But that is just the type of bread it is.  We would go here again when we stay downtown.",

    "text": "Visit: 5/13/09 - Dinner.  Ate the Prime rib, porterhouse and onion soup.  Onion Soup was watery.  No onion taste at all.  The cheese on top was good.  The soup came cold.  House Salad had rasberry dressing that was too sweet.  Tasted like frosting instead of dressing.  Prime rib was good.  The portion was big, but the meat tasted old.  I am not a beef expert, but maybe oldness came from aging the prime rib longer than most places for better taste.  Porterhouse was good.  Pretty dry for a medium rare piece.  Service was bad.  They put a bottle of water down on the table and expect you to pour it out by yourself.  We also asked them to have a seat next to the window and they said that the tables were all reserved.  There were only 3 other couples in the whole restaurant.  They were just being lazy donkeys.  Prices were very high.  For the taste of the food, not worth $40 for prime rib.  I would not come back here.  Not worth it.",

    "text": "My wife and I recently went to this classic steakhouse for the first time.  The restaurant has excellent food, service and ambiance with a great view of downtown Vegas.  Their specialty is prime rib and I got the small one (16 oz).  It was a little tough for my taste, but I did order it rare.  My wife got the filet (rare), which was perfect.  My buddy recently told me that you should always order prime rib cooked up one level from where you would normally order.  So if you would normally order rare, order your prime rib medium rare.  I'll try this next time or maybe just get the fillet.  We got seated in a booth away from the window, which was not a great seat.  Next time I make my reservation, I'll insist on a window seat.  Given the choice between Binion's Steakhouse and Hugo's Cellar (at Four Queens), I'd choose Hugo's Cellar.  But Binion's was still a great restaurant and I will go back.  Food-3.5 stars, Service-5 stars, Value-4 stars, Ambiance-5 stars.",

    "text": "My brother first introduced me to the steak house at Binions a few years back, we ventured our way through the hotel and took an elevator up to what was labeled as \"SH\". On our way up suddenly we were greeted with a breathtaking view of the city as we gazed through the glass elevator.   The waiter service is superb and the staff that work there have been there for some time, always nice to see friendly faces. The bartender pours great drinks, and they don't skimp out or water them down. Great pours. *****  The place is where you would take a date, a darker atmosphere but mostly to enjoy the scenery of las vegas from the heights. However I come here with everyone and when we leave people are most satisfied .   The food is great, the cuts are huge, the flavor is perfect and they cook to your desired perfection (although med. rare is the best ;)) Ask for their specials as they often mix things up to make the perfect meal and don't fill up on the bread! Although very good, its not worth filling up on when you have your food ahead of you.  Make reservations, just call binions and ask for steakhouse reservations and plan for a nice evening, great views and great food.  The sad news is the glass elevator is out of service, the equipment is so old they can't get it repaired and may have to put in a new one all together, but it would sure be worth it.",
