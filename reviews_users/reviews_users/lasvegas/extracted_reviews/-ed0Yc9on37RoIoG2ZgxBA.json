Luckily they have a nice patio area with heat lamps so they set us up outside.  The food was OK...not the best Thai I'd ever had and I feel that was the general opinion of the group.  It was a bit pricey for what it was and where it was located though.  I would go back in a group setting if other people wanted to go but Vegas has way too many good restaurants to eat a place that is just OK.",

    "text": "Lotus of Siam gets a lot of attention for being rated the #1 Thai restaurant in the U.S. But every time I try to go there, there's either a line out the door, or it's closed -- as happened yesterday. I remembered hearing about Le Thai, so I went there as a Plan B. Now, it's my new Plan A!  I'm not really a Thai food snob (I usually just order pad Thai)...and as anyone who's read my other reviews knows, I rate restaurants more based on their atmo than the food quality, anyway. You can get good food at the f*cking grocery store! If you're PAYING to eat out, you want a cool atmo, to make it worth your while. RIGHT?!  Le Thai has a very cool atmo. It's cute and teeny-tiny -- so cute and teeny-tiny you almost expect it to start shooting ping pong balls out its....well, you know! About 1/2 is in the front room, and the other 2/3 is in this really cool sort of beer-garden-ish courtyard-type room. VERY cool!  The windows in the front room look out onto Fremont St. East, so depending on the time of day you can either watch winos and crackheads shuffling down the sidewalk, or drunk-ass college girls stumbling out of Insert Coins across the street. (I recommend the early show... the late show is old news. Although one of my fave things about this joint is that it's open til LATE -- midnight during the week, and 2am on weekends.)  I went here for lunch, and had a bowl of tofu pad thai, a 4 on the spiciness scale of 1-5. It was GREAT! Pretty spicy, but tolerable, and I think it was around $8. Good deal!  I am in the process of moving downtown...so I will most definitely be comign here again!",

    "text": "A few years ago I would not have even thought about eating in downtown Las Vegas's Freemont East but they have really cleaned the place up recently and so I decided to go ahead a give Le Thai a try due to all the great reviews on Yelp. I can happily (and hungrily) say that the reviews are correct. This place is some kinda wonderful. I've never been to Thailand but If I ever go I hope all the food is this good. First I started off with the Thai Iced Tea....I never knew Ice Tea could be this good. It was cooling, creamy (coconut milk maybe?) and refreshing and was the perfect beverage to my spicy foods.  Le Thai is small and dark, but it gives off a cool vibe, kinda like your sitting in a secret room that nobody else knows about, except that the whole city of Vegas seemed to be eating there the night we went. While drinking our drinks and eating our meal we literally were staring at a wall because the bar in front of the wall was the only place to sit.  For an appetizer we started with pork jerky and sticky rice. I'm not sure what the sticky rice was for but the pork was pretty amazing.  It was lightly seasoned and then fried into chunks and was served with something called waterfall sauce. I'm not sure where the waterfall was but it was some good tasting water that was coming from it. My wife and I scarfed it all down. Because we gorged ourselves on fried pork the wife thought it best to have something lite for her entree choice and went with a papaya salad. She had a choice of heat level (1-5) and decided on one which was probably a good choice because it was just spicy enough for her. The salad was really tasty. The Papaya was thinly shredded and reminded me of a rice noodle. Chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and some other veggies were tossed with a Thai Chilli Lime Sauce and it was a very refreshing and light tasting meal.  I went the opposite direction with my meal and decided to go heavy and rich with a Beef Short Rib Fried Rice topped of with a over easy fried egg. I am so glad I did because it was pretty amazing tasting.  The beef was shredded then mixed into the onion and cilantro laced Fried Rice. With the yolk of the egg mixed into it was just delicious on all levels. It was also very spicy even though I only went with a three on the heat scale. Those Thai folks definitely like the spice. Heartburn be damned.....I finished off the entire bowl and washed down an antacid with another Ice Tea.  This was a pretty amazing meal and some of the best Thai Food I have ever had anywhere.",

Got my beverage and no freaking straw was given. Tried to call the attention of the waitress but they kept running like idiots.  Food finally arrived. Oh, wait no silver nor napkins were given to us....  Ordered a Tom Kha not the whole menu. What took sooo long?? Whats the point of having an ipod???   Tom Kha was actually very decent. Nothing mindblowing. There are SO MANY good thai restaurants in Vegas....   Time to pay. We got informed that no debit/credit card payment was available due to problems in the station. WTF?? Thank you for letting us know at the last moment....   We requested to speak to the manager, she basically gave us the middle finger and told us to go to the ATM at El Cortez. Sure. Got charged $3 for withdrawal....   Second time here. First time was disappointing. Now was ridiculous.  Hip-wannabe place with one of the WORST services ever received in a Vegas restaurant.

    "text": "I was quite impressed with Le Thai!  A few coworkers and I ate \"family style\" there today so we could give the place the \"Thai test\".  I can safely say that this place was a hit.  The atmosphere, especially outside, is really cool.  It's casual yet sheltering from down town Vegas.  There were heat lamps this afternoon since it was a little chilly which made the comfort level quite nice. To top that off, the service was excellent.  Food came right away to our table, and the waitresses made sure we were happy from start to end.  First off was the Tom Kha Khi (chicken).  I ordered some lime juice on the side, as i usually do for this dish.  The soup was quite delicious, perfectly sour with my addition of lime juice.  Very nice coconut broth, lemongrass, generously sized and plentiful mushrooms, and a few chunks of chicken filled our bowls.  The mixture of herbs was masterfully prepared I thought, but there really wasn't enough chicken.  Next up was the garlic fried rice with beef.  This was perfectly prepared, and again the herb flavors where just amazing.  The beef was flavorful and not at all chewy.  There wasn't too much grease, but there was tons of flavor!  Just how I like my fried rice.  We also tried the Awesome Noodles.  They are indeed awesome.  There is a similar dish served at Thai Style Noodle House, and Le Thai does a better job.  Light smokey flavors balance the lightly sweet sauce.  This dish is kind of a cross between Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.  Very nice, I would order again!  Last up is the infamous Three Colored Curry.  I have to say that this was much better than the version we had at Mixed Zone.  It was light, but flavorful enough on my brown rice.  I would love to try a more \"powerful\" version of this curry.    For dessert, we tried the Roti with Nutella.  This was definitely the most unique version of a Roti dessert that I have had.  There was fried egg in it, along with yummy Nutella, and topped with powdered sugar.  Very rich, very different.  It reminded me of French Toast with chocolate.    I am giving Le Thai a 4.5, rounded up to a 5.  While this place doesn't trump my two or three favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas, it is definitely up there.  The food is slightly Americanized, but my only real beef is the spiciness of the food.  This is definitely American spice levels, not Thai levels.  Of course that is nothing a little chili powder can't solve.",

I went to Le Thai with 6 other ladies after having a few drinks around the corner at DCR. Le Thai is le tiny. If you have a group, do what we did and make a reservation. We were seated outside, which is a lovely area complete with heaters for those cool Vegas nights. And the music was fantastic!   The menu at Le Thai is small. You know those little cards some eateries put on tables to list their wines? That's the menu at Le Thai. Despite the small menu size there is still a nice variety of options to try.   I don't recall what I ordered. I do recall that it was damn tasty. Unlike some of my fabulous friends, I am a big baby when it comes to spiciness... and I have had issues at other places around town making my food too spicy. This was not an issue at Le Thai at all, and from what I heard around the table, the ladies that do like it hot were pleased with the level of spice in their dishes. The Lady Boy drink was fantastic, I would have had 2 but we had another bar to hit. It's downtown, duh.  If you need an inexpensive and tasty meal while you are downtown, Le Thai is worth a try. I heard they have an actual sign now too, so it's easier to find!",

It was packed and they seemed understaffed, so I stuck around even though I would just normally leave. It took them so long to greet me, serve me and give me my check (and three different people dealt with me) that I just left full cash from my gambling money instead of using my card as I wanted to....I did not want to wait anymore.   The food was...average Thai food. I ordered yellow curry which seemed more like water than like curry. I am used to a thicker pastier curry, or if the curry is thin, it tastes like ingredients, full of flavor, but not like mostly water. I received it mild because I do not like spicy foods so perhaps it was missing some needed taste for that reason.  The joint itself is very divey, which I should have expected considering that it is on Fremont. I did not like the decor with wooded plank ceilings. It was not cozy at all with all hard chairs and no booths.   Nothing great about this place. The $11 curry sounds about right for Thai food but for that price I am usually blown away by other Thai restaurants. I wouldn't return. There is nothing there for me.",

Le Thai is a strange one to me, I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I don't mind eating there often (mostly because I live across the street), its better than most all restaurants around it, and its a pleasant dining esperience overall - it just doesn't get me that excited.    I've been here a few times and I've had the Pad Kee Mow, the Pad Thai, and the Awesome Noodles dishes.  The meat choices are beef, pork, chicken, or tofu.  I wasn't crazy about the Awesome Noodles, a bit too bland for me.  The Pad Kee Mow might be my fav of the three, but the Pad Thai is also good.  I think the noodles are a tad over-cooked and the meat is typically a bit too dry.  Not enough to make me dislike the meal, but still noticeable detractors.  There is also a pork jerkey on a stick type appetizer that i wasn't crazy about, too fatty/rubbery for my taste.    The meal selections are tiny, which isn't the end of the world, but there could be a bit more.  They use the same noodles for each dish and although different flavors, each dish seems omewhat similar for that reason.    I like the selection of beer and saki, especially the saki.    The atmosphere is kinda cool, with trendy inside and outside seating, but the inside area is really cramped with tables squeezed next to each other.    The service I've had has been hit and miss.  At times its been very good, and other times I'be been left alone for too long without refills or check ups.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that the service is poor, they are friendly enough, it's just inconsistant.    Pricing is very reasonable.    Location is good because Fremont has really been missing decent quality restaurants    In the end i would never steer someone away from dining at Le Thai, it's just that i wouldn't rave about it either.",

    "text": "I've been exploring Thai food as a relatively recentish resident of Las Vegas. We didn't have a ton of Thai places back home in Tucson, so coming here, there is a crazy amount! Le Thai is the best I've had in Vegas/Henderson so far.  We took a seat on the patio, hoping it wasn't as hot as it was outside there, and they had misters going it was a very comfortable temperature. The patio has beautiful murals and lights. It feel like you aren't in the middle of the somewhat grungy area of Fremont. It's peaceful and eclectic.  I am a sucker for Tom Kha soup at ANY restaurant but its always a pleasant surprise to see it done super well. And the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Fried Egg Rolls were super good. Even though the prices are a little higher than the dirt cheap usual prices of Thai restaurant, once you take a bite you realize why. It is so, so good!   Tom Kha Soup: Me and my husband ALWAYS share this whenever we get Thai food. He hates the mushrooms, I pass on the larger pieces of chicken and it works out perfectly. This soup was the best I've had. We got a 3/10 on the spice scale. Not looking to die today. And it was the perfect amount of spice. Didn't make your face fall off but also you still got a tiny kick. But if you are a fan of spicy, go ahead and order a high number. I'm sure its fantastic.  Fried Egg Rolls & Plum Sauce: Yum. I'm always a sucker for an egg roll. Those and Crab Rangoons are my favorite when it comes to fried apps. These were veggie only. And they were delicious. Not super greasy, as they should be and not flaming hot. As in, we could actually take a full on bite right when they got to the table. Which is how it should be done!  Short Rib Fried Rice: This was a new one for me. I'm a big fan of fried rice and short rib just sounded good. Oh and it was. There was so much flavor in this one. And the short rib wasn't too fatty, which can ruin short rib for me. Every big piece of short rib was fully flavorful meat and not all stretched out with fat. There was a great amount of short rib in the rice too. It was very balanced. I would definitely share this as an entree and try other stuff on the menu like appetizers. That way you get to try a little of each.   I will definitely be returning to this place and tying some other menu items. Maybe some noodles next time. Who knows? I'm sure it will be delicious.",

I TOTALLY GET WHY THEIR PRICES ARE SO HIGH, since their on the strip, but seriously??? TEN DOLLARS for soup???? I had the same soup, (actually better & BIGGER) in Colorado for ONLY $4. I was HOPING to walk out with a Thai tea as well but I only had $20 so it all went to soup & spring rolls. LOL",

When you go, definitely order the pad see ewe and three color curry (beef or pork). Their spice level is no joke, which is one of my favorite things about this place. A lot of local Thai places are timid and inconsistent on spice levels, but Le Thai does not shy away from heat and you can expect the same every time. No matter what you order, you can expect it to be well seasoned and delicious.  One thing to note is that it has very limited seating, so make a reservation if you can. Sit in the garden if you can.",

I would highly recommend REMOVING the option to put your name on the wait list on Yelp if you are just going to make people wait an ADDITIONAL 20-25 minutes AFTER they arrive! Keep in mind, there were only 2 of us in our party (my wife and I) AND we visited on a Wednesday night.This made ZERO sense to me. Why would you have me put my name on a waiting list (on Yelp) then, give me a specific time I have to get there (before I lose my place in line) but even if I arrive on time, you make me wait an additional 20-25 minutes??? This needs to be improved or just removed all together. Only thing it's going to do is make your customers upset and/ or irritated and leave. the only other thing I would recommend is to possibly think about putting a little less cilantro in the pad Thai. It tasted a little bit too much like a Mexican dish for me.. other than that, our server was pleasant and attentive(can't remember his name). It's a cool spot to get some good Thai food if you don't mind the wait.",

I've heard so many good things that I feel bad about waiting this long to actually try this place out!  There was a little bit of a wait since it's a smaller venue and it was a Friday night so we went next door to Commonwealth for drinks while we waited. This made the wait go by fast and they text you when the order is ready which is really helpful.  I went with two of my friends and we each ordered our own dish but we all tried each others. I decided to order the drunken noodles based off the recommendation of the waitress. They were amazing! I would recommend this dish out of all I tried. They were tasty and just the right amount of spicy (I think I ordered a 3 out of 5). My other friend order the yellow beef curry and he ordered a 4 out of 5 in the spiciness and it was wayyy to spicy and I could barely eat it because it was just too spicy for me. It also caused a little heart burn for me after. For me 3/5 spicy is perfect.   The prices weren't too bad and the service was good. I just recommend getting here early if you don't want to wait too long because it is a popular place to dine in DT LV.  PS** Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get your free beer coozie! :)",

Here's the depressing part, when Las Vegas was strict with the massacre on 10/01/17, I lost one of my friends. This place was a staple that we would always go to and have a great dinner. However, something he always got and something I always will get is the TomKa soup. It's creamy, delicious and will definitely fill you up!  Word of advise, if you're not a spicy fan, get a 1 or 2 for the spice level. The 5 will make your butt cry the next day haha.  Service is never great, which is why they get a 4, but the food makes it worth it to return over and over again  It's definitely a must go! Enjoy!",

Don't get mad at a place, which is tiny and popular, if they can't get you in right away. Also I love yelp, but I feel sometimes reviewers give a very narrow view of an experience which they've had once or twice. Which I loved for the raw content, but sometimes it's bias and that's unfortunate.  This isn't the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, but in downtown it's damn close.

Short rib fried rice with yellow curry...... INCREDIBLE.  I sat at the bar with Ashley and Pedro, two exceptional bartenders who were super attentive and urbane.  Regardless of how busy the place was Dino and the workforce at Le Thai made it seem effortless with every detail in striving to leave every guest satisfied with the cuisine and service.  Great place as always.  Thanks guys and gals I'll definitely be back soon.",

I'm a huge Thai food fan and not all places measure up to my standards, but Le Thai exceded my standards.  Now because the restaurant is small you may have a wait, but the host will page your cell phone when you table is ready. Le Thai's menu is small but everything is flavorful and delicious. The flavor explosion will melt your mind and taste buds. You'll not be disappointed in the array of thai spices used to create your food. Now Frank ordered many items to sample from but it's started off with a glass of there Thai Ice Tea. A sweet tasting refreshing beverage the will satisfy your thirst.   Waterfall Beef is awesome an amazing way to start your meal . The Thai \"beef\" Salad exceeded my expectations with all the flavors that came out of it. If you've always wondered what the perfect salad was then order this one. Now for your main items the short rib rice ushered me into the new wave of rice dishes. The short rib meat added a sweet flavoring to fried rice like I've never experience before and I loved it. And let's not forget about the Pad Thai noodle dish, because it was off the flavor chart. A perfect 10 for Pad Thai dishes and it shows. This place may be small but it's culinary dishes give it a huge restaurant presence in Vegas. I can't wait to eat here again.  Make sure you check into YELP so you can get \"FREE HUG\" coupon. It's a life saver after the food.",

We came in and sat outside on the back patio right under the mist . Unfortunately I can't remember my servers name .. but he was so amazing!! If you see a guy in dreads make sure he serves you !! He recommended this amazing Cucumber mint vodka martini that was super refreshing and delicious!! We checked into our Yelp profiles and received a free Thai tea!! After the Martini I ordered a tamarind margarita . Being Mexican I love my tamarind. We finally ordered our food and we ordered the Vegan Curry at level 3 and a Tom Kha with tofu at a level 5 ... My god !! Our food was ridiculously delicious !! We spent 23 days in Thailand in December and I must say that the authenticity of le Thai is pretty accurate ! We took some left overs home and of course we scarfed them down that night! What I really appreciated about le thai other than the delicious food was the personable , caring and attentive staff!! Definitely bringing  my family here next time they come visit me!!",

Small and understated if it wasn't for the lighted up sign I could have missed it.  Interior: 5 stars! Adorable inside. You basically have two seating options, sit inside at the bar with views of the chefs or make your way back it tropical covered outdoor patio. Patio was lovely for a group but for something more fun I'd love to sit overlooking the kitchen.   Service: 4.5 stars; our waitress was lovely and welcoming. Knowing it was our first time she offered great suggestions but also wasn't jumping down our throat. The place was packed on a Monday night so the food took a little while to come out, it really wasn't that bad though but worth mentioning.  Food: 5 stars! Best pad thai I've ever had!!! I'd come again and again for it. Made my meal. Rice is good as well might try a new fried rice next time. The panang curry was \"ok\" I'm a little spoiled when it comes to panang so while I didn't think it was the best it was still enjoyed by our party. Pricing is also totally reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would highly recommend this spot. Plenty of locals so you know it's good.",

Our server this past time was nice but not overbearing and checked on us but also didn't hover which I liked. She double checked that everything came out the way we wanted and made it an all around good time.  There is always a wait but it's worth it. Especially when the weather is nice, or in the evening, try to sit on the back patio! It's covered and has heaters for the winter which are VERY warm and the ambience is even nicer. :) definitely one of our favorite restaurants. If we lived closer we would come back every week!",

My friend said the panang curry was pretty spicy compared to usual for her but she still loved it. The fried rice was also amazing.   You HAVE to get the mango sticky rice.

Just a block up from the collection of those classic casinos (Binion's, Four Queens) we see this sleek, practically modern block with craft beer bars, lounges and this Thai restaurant.  The space is tiny although frees up a bit in the back area.  The bartender gave us great tips on what and how to order (spice level from 0 to 5, and 1 was already making me sweat).    The appetizer of Thai Pork Jerky was flavorful, although just a touch tougher than I expected.  The waterfall sauce was refreshing.  The Short Rib Fried Rice was so good it made me feel zero guilt for indulging in the carbs.  The large serving contained tiny tender pulled short ribs pieces throughout, making every bite luxuriously savory and rich.  It goes right up there with duck fried rice as my favorite Thai creations.  Thanks for making rice so interesting, Thailand!     The alcohol selection is small but quirky - particularly a beer each per Asian country.  The price is eminently reasonable for Las Vegas, being in downtown Vegas and all.  Well worth a trip back for me to dine here, and explore the rest of this burgeoning area.",

We had the Thai salad with shrimp, chicken wings, fried rice (although I can't remember which one), and the 3 spice curry.   The Thai salad was to die for...I've woken up numerous times in the middle of the night licking my lips craving it (nope I'm not even pregnant).   It was spiced with a sriracha dressing that made it spicy and oh so wonderful.  I know the rest of the food was equally as amazing, but the salad stood out the most.  I LOVED the outdoor seating.  We were there during the afternoon when it was quiet.  I didn't feel like I was in Vegas. AWESOME!",

    "text": "Our experience began well enough. Hostess used her phone to manage the list. Quoted 35 min and she would text us. We went off to Walgreens and just generally  walking around the area. Overall,that section of Fremont is much improved.   When we got back close to the time, I watched her seat a couple who had checked in after us but was seated at the bar. When I asked about that I was met with an indignant sarcastic remark. I watched others struggle with the seating process as well. Same MO. Confusion,cattiness,poor show to guests.  Yes...you are busy now. Good luck when you are not.  This situation could have been alleviated by a few easy words... 'I'm sorry. I made a mistake.I will get you the best table I have next'. Instead, crappy bar seat. Bar shakes constantly.   Wait staff lovely and food good.  Really would have loved to spend my whole time raving about them but the seating process and attitude I was met with were a total turn off.  Stick w Lotus of Siam. Their seating process is fair and lacks the drama of le thai's.  their food is better too. Advise to call ahead.",

It is the gosh-darn BEST Thai food in Vegas (and pretty much best anywhere I've been since Thailand! Lol!) Had my favorite \"Drunken Noodles\" and I always order that at Thai places and these are simply the best! You get a great-sized portion too! Also had the Yellow Curry with tofu and it was equally as delicious!! Washed it all down with the Happy Hour menu (3pm-6pm Mon-Fri) The Singha beer(s) topped off our delightful Thai food experience! We had great service even though they got busy during our time here they did great! I highly recommend this place when in Vegas!",

Food was extremely bland & service was complete shit. There is this 4 split check limit for a party 10 in which my party was unaware of.  This made our experience here stressful and complicated. Each time I came thru, it was always difficult to pay. The prices aren't worth the experience or food. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS PLACE IS CONSIDERED BEST THAI FOOD IN LAS VEGAS.",

Very small place so expect to wait a bit, I suggest making reservations if you can. Everything I have had (pad see ew, soups, chicken wings, chili basil, panang) have all been delicious!! The only negatives I have to add are that the portions are just a little small for the price, but it's all incredibly tasty. When I went there last I had the spiked Thai tea, it wasn't all that great I was expecting it to be ultra super amazing since I'm a huge fan of Thai tea. I would definitely be giving Le Thai 5 stars cause the food is awesome, but I'm taking a star away due to the tad but smaller portions than what the price tags suggest.. It is definitely worth a try if you are a fan of Thai food.",

There's plenty to see in the area so you can check in and leave a phone number with them so that they can call you when your table is ready.  Be prepared to pay almost twice what you would at most casual Thai restaurants and be aware that they have a very limited menu, which you can see on the web at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lethaivegas.com&s=8e3aa1c85a2c6e1f57c1656612fdc234784f23c053c6e3d08a65f60f09cb4c80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lethaivegas.com</a>  The food comes out quick and very hot. The taste was fantastic. The spice levels are 1-5 and according to my wife, the 2 was hotter than she was accustomed to so if you have any doubts, go low. I thought the level 5 was just right for those of us who really like it hot.  We will definitely return to Le Thai.  Edit: We are back for dinner a day later at ten minutes until five and no wait at all.   Service both days has been great. The food is still fantastic. Don't miss this if you're in Vegas. Even if you don't think you'd like Thai food you should take a chance; I doubt you'll regret it.",

Located on Freemont Street in what is the old strip Le Thai is serving up delicious steaming bowls of Thai noodle goodness.   This dish I had was called awesome flat noodles and there is no better way to describe it.   The restaurant is small but offers patio and indoor seating with mist outside for those hot desert days. A great beer, wine and cocktail list really round this place off as both a day and night time place to get out of the heat.   Our service was friendly and our noodles were, well, awesome!   If we had found this place earlier in our trip I am sure we would have eaten here more than once!",

The seating is pretty limited, and last time we went, we had to eat out on the patio. It had a fun, intimate atmosphere, and the lighting was beautiful. It was quite warm outside and, despite the misters, I felt like I was melting. Now honestly, this could have been a combination of the weather and the spice-level 4 food that I got, so I'm fine with that. I just wish there was a little more indoor seating, but the venue doesn't really allow for that.   The waiter up-sold us on a beer that was overpriced, and not the most tasty, but the food more than made up for it. Will definitely be a repeat customer for a long time!",

The sauce was amazing and the pork was cooked perfectly with a little crispiness to it. My main dish was a ginger beef fried rice. I requested spiciness level 3 and that was good. A decent amount of heat but not overwhelming. My husband had the three color coconut curry with chicken which was also very tasty.   The portions were large and the price was very reasonable. 4 beers, 2 apps, 2 main dishes for under $60. They have happy hour specials too. The only negative was the lack of indoor space. There is just a few tables and a bar.  The back patio was nice even on a hot day with misters going, nice atmosphere, but I would rather be inside on a hot day eating spicy food.",

This place I have heard so much about and finally was able to try this past weekend with my friends.   We didn't even intend on coming here but just kind of stumbled upon it literally after doing some bar hoping. I looked up at the sign like \"ohhh this is Le Thai\" sign us up! The wait wasn't too bad for a weekend we were quoted I believe like 45 minutes and so that wasn't bad we headed over to another bar to kill some time and get less and less sober ha-ha. They texted in about 30 minutes after saying the table was ready which was awesome because over delivering on a wait time for a hungry customer is an absolute PLUS.  As we walked in I noticed the decor and liked a few of the art work pieces that they featured on the walls. Our server came over In a decent amount of time but after that she wasn't very attentive. So when we let her know that it was our first time she was just like ok.. you know missed the whole cue of common courtesy to the customer like offering some popular menu options to us. The other thing that rubbed my group of friends and I was the amount of times that she kept reminding us that once we ordered we cannot send the plate back. Like huh? Okay so you're telling me that if I order a dish that doesn't taste right to my liking I cannot send it back to the kitchen for them to prepare it correctly? That was pretty offensive actually and so if it hadn't had been for that they MIGHT have gotten 5 stars but I thought it was pretty unprofessional to sit up and keep pressing us about this whole thing you can't send your food back. I HAVE NEVER been to a restaurant who says this right before you order your food..  On top of that she was terrible with filling our water up and refilling drinks!  At most Thai places that I have been to they do a scale of 1-10..prepared to give my normal number of either a 7 or an 8 our server let me know they do 1-5 so I picked 4 and so did my friend and she says \"Are you sure that's really hot you might want to do a 3\" we were sure and she says \"Ok well remember you can't send back\" **rolls eyes** let me say this much had it not been for us really starving I would've got my ass up and LEFT because it was so annoying...  All in all the food was good! Spicy for sure but nothing that I couldn't handle. I can see myself considering to come back as long as I'm not harassed with reminders about the You Cant Send Food Back reminders like I feel as though they should put an \"All Sales Final\" sign up or something if that's the damn case...",

Husband and I swung by and BOY, we loved it. Possible due to some intoxication, hunger or/and just deep appreciation to Thai food, this really was the BEST we've ever had!   We ordered their speciality, 3 Curry Pad Thai, Waterfall Beef Appetizer, and Drunken Noodle Pad Thai (garlic kind) && it was all sooooo beautiful. We had leftovers so we ended up taking it to our hotel room & eating it at the end of our drunk adventure in Las Vegas!   Thank you Le Thai, we will be back",

They have some sort of app you can use to let you know when they are ready for you, but not being the brightest girl on the block, I don't have it. The wait can be about 30 minutes, but there is lots to do while you wait and the wait is worth it.  All of the dishes are great but my favorite is any of their curries and their garlic fried rice with shrimp. They also have great spring rolls. I don't care for the cucumber salad, a bite dull for me. The Pad Thai with shrimp is heaven.   The place is small and it can get a tad warm so I like to go later in the day.  If you like Thai food, this is the place for you in Downtown and you won't be broke when you leave.",

The decor is nice and tropical and you feel like you are in a real Thai outdoor dining hall. There's heat lamps though to keep you toasty on a chilly February evening.  I had the short rib fried rice which was really tasty and very filling. I was dying of thirst afterwards, though, so I guess the dish is quite salty or maybe has msg? I'm not sure that their spice grade (1 mild to 5 Thai spicy) is very consistent because my 3 was zero spice but my husband's 4 was ridiculously spicy.   Don't forget to do check-in on Yelp for bogo iced tea. Wait list on Yelp was really convenient. We had time to go check out the container park 2 blocks away while we were waiting to get a text from the restaurant.",

The last time I went it was happy hour so I ordered a Thai Mojito which had basil in place of the traditional mint.. it was refreshing and very tasty and my girl friend got a Thai tea which was good but could have had a little more tea flavor. (We also were able to get the yelp check in offer of a free Thai tea when you order a second)   Next we got the Thai style wings which was on the happy hour menu. They were crispy and delish I will definitely be ordering these again!   Next we ordered chicken Pad See Ewe and it was really yummy. The noodles were a wider noodle and the flavor was on point.   And the best for last... Short ribs fried rice! I order this dish every time we come and it never disappoints. The meat is sooo tender and work well with the rice. Spice level of 2 for all dishes which gives a little kick but nothing overbearing otherwise your mouth will be on fire.  Service... our waitress was really good and wish I could remember her name. The hostess could have been a little more friendlier. She wanted to seat us right by the entrance which I am not a fan of considering I'm always cold.. when I requested a table from the main seating area she told me she would have to clear off a table in a not so nice way.. sorry you have to take time out of your not so busy day to clear off a table!    All in all it's one of my favorite places to come when I'm in the downtown Vegas area and I will be back!",

Of course you're not in Bangkok though, you're in a polished partially hipster-manned Thai cooking machine, catering to the same degenerate tourists and way more degenerate locals. The cocktail menu is underwhelming. But the booze is decently prized at happy hour. The food here is as good as your order. The authenticity...I'm not certain about, as I've only enjoyed their most Americanized dishes like the Pad Thai, Panang, and happy hour Chicken Wings. Is it the best Thai restaurant in Vegas? Not even close; it maybe slips into the top 10. But is it the most fun? Most definitely. Regardless of how average this place may be (a surprise given it's awesome Vegas pedigree). I give it four stars for experience and how \"somehow\" they make a technically average plate of noodles taste like nectar and ambrosia.",

My go to is always the Awesome noodle with chicken @ level 3 spice . I love everything spicy but be careful not to get crazy because if there is anything left over the heat tends to increase!  The space isn't big but the patio is cool and the service is always friendly.  Tree was out server and she was on point and even wore a tiara ! I loved it !

We probably stood there for five minutes while she was walking around fixing the outside tables when they didn't need fixing. We were finally sat down after a bit.  We sat there for a good ten minutes and someone finally came to tell us our server would be with us. The server comes a few minutes later and asked us what we wanted. I didn't know what I wanted because we weren't given menus.   When we finally ordered, we waited a long time to get our food. Our server told us it was because they had a big party that they just served which was fine BUT the tables next to us who sat later than us got their meals. I was so annoyed and hungry. They didn't even come back to give us more water or ask us if we needed anything.  The meals were good. We got the Pad Thai and the Ga Pow. The Pad Thai was really good especially with the shrimp. The Ga Pow was really salty. It was good but just really salty.  The whole experience was just ruined by the service and I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends.

They said the wait was two hours, it ended up being probably 45 minutes (there were only 3 parties ahead of us). The service was not that great and it took a really long time to get our food, which all came out at very different times with one of my friends not getting hers until everyone else was finished (a good 30 min at least). They didn't apologize or comp anything, which we were surprised about since not only did they mess her order up, but it was so so late! I had the Green Curry, my brother had the Ga Pow, and other friends got different noodle dishes. I honestly think other Thai places are way better. They said mine had no spice (and it definitely did I was dying the whole time) while they said my brothers was a 4 when he couldn't taste anything and had to ask for additional sauce. They were busy which could explain some of the flusteredness but overall was just an ok experience!",

The beef was perfectly cooked with a little char, however, still very tender. It paired nicely with the fluffy white rice.

The fried bananas are good. It's wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper, fried, has banana syrup drizzled on top and dusted with powdered sugar. The banana is mushy, but a good mushy.   I'd try this place again if I'm in the mood for Thai while in Vegas.",

Got it to go on the way to the airport and finished it in the waiting area already - never made it to the plane. Ambience is very nice, notice that they get busy very quick. The noise level is high. Even though we did not sit in the courtyard, loved that they have nicely decorated that with amazing lights. The staff is nice and courteous as well as serves with a smile. The yelp thai tea BOGO is fantastic too.",

My 60+ mother asked if ok to use the bathroom because we had every intention to eat there. After that, my father asked how long was the wait. They told us but it was too long because we were very hungry (late afternoon 2ish). So my dad says no thanks. At which point they go in and try to evict my mother out of the bathroom because customers only. Wtf?! We were totally going to eat there but wait was too long. Let the senior citizen use the bathroom anyway. Not impressed.",

    "text": "Do not do it!!!!!!!  We walked in and it smelled great. However, that's where it ended.  The service was non existent and the three times we saw our waitress were for our drink/food order, when she forgot what we had ordered, and when she gave us the check.    We ordered the crispy spring rolls as an appetizer.  They came out fairly quick on a lettuce leaf and looked really good.  As I selected one, I noticed the pool of GREASE and OIL that remained on the leave under it.  I cut it in half and more oil spilled out onto the plate.  I used my one napkin to dab what i could from it. The napkin became transparent.  After most of the oil was removed, I finally took a bite. Crunchy, tasteless, greasy, and disappointing.  I dissected the one I had tried and noticed some brown jelly noodles in it that served no purpose.  The other 3  stayed on the plate as I sat hoping the main course would be better.    The short rib fried rice level 4 heat Bland and tasteless pot roast mixed with 2 pieces of onion and some brown cilantro on top of rice.  I ate 3 bites covered in Sriracha before deciding I'll toss it and go get a hotdog elsewhere.    The wife's  Chicken Pad Thai level 5 heat Basically the same as the fried rice, bland bland bland!  The chicken had a fishy smell and taste to it.  She ate a few bites and decided it was to disgusting to continue.   Another waiter took our plates and asked if we would like to-go boxes. Both of us quickly said no.  I wouldn't feed that to a dog.    $40 later and 5 minutes after we leave. Both of our stomachs turn and into the toilet it goes.  I'm praying we don't get food poisoning from this terrible terrible place.  You can keep your food and your free hug.  Update:  We both got E. coli food poisoning.  Ruined the rest of our stay in Vegas as we couldn't be more than 10 feet from a toilet.",

    "text": "Yum!   When I think of food in Vegas, the only thing that comes to mind is something that's cheap and bad for you. This last time in Vegas, I decided to use Yelp to guide me to a place of deliciousness.  My friends and I stayed on Fremont this time. That deserves it's own review, but I'm here to heap some more praise on Le Thai. My experience here was great. It's so busy that they have reservations... I called and was told it would be a 1 hour wait. After giving the lady my number, I immediately received a text and was told I could download an app to see my progress.   About an hour later, I notice that the app still shows there's a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking to the restaurant and were told they were very busy, and the app was correct. The hostess was very apologetic, but offered our party of four to sit against a bar area. We were hungry, so we agreed.  The service was quick! And our server was very nice and attentive.   We started off with an order of some delicious wings and chicken skewers. The wings were delicious and came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken skewers were delicious as well... Moist, tender, and had a great flavor.  For our main dishes we got the Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry, and Drunken Noodles! The three dishes were so yummy! The level of spiciness that we ordered was spot on. The dishes were delicious and the food came out piping hot.   My only complaints are this...  1.) GIVE PEOPLE WHITE RICE with their meals. It's fuckin' cheap. You want to mix white rice with your food. Yes, it came with the curry, but that's not enough. DON'T BE CHEAP. Your food is already expensive as it is, and it's JUST thai food...   2.) PUT SOME FAN/AIR in the back patio. It was like 200 degress back there, and the only thing that kept me from dying was the cold water and cold beer I had.   Overall a good thai food place. I would definitely return.",

Although we didn't have to wait for a table (cuz we choose the bar seats), and the servers were very nice, but the wait for the actual food were absurd (total of at least an hour). And the food weren't that good. We ordered : Thai iced tea -- too sweet, you can't taste the flavor of the tea Chicken satay -- decent, all because of the peanut sauce , the chicken is basically tasteless, if you don't dip the sauce Awesome flat noodle --it's a funny dish to me, it got sweet and burn flavor mixed Short rip fried rice --claim as their signature dish, but the pull beef is too salty. Since its too salty, you can't taste anything. I could not finish it.",

We ended up going on Saturday night at 8pm with a big group, we did have a reservation. We got there a big early and we got some cocktails, which we were planning on doing anyhow. I ended up getting a \"Ladyboy\" which was pretty funny name for a drink at a thai place. It was good and interesting, kind of like a Thai mule style drink.   So we had to wait a long time to get seated, to order, to get the food, to get the check etc etc. And that's why this place isn't getting 5 Stars because the food is ridiculously good! And I'm giving them 4.5 because it's pretty obvious it's a small place that just can't handle huge parties.   We ordered some appetizers, the pork jerky was great and the sauce it came with paired really well with it.   I think we probably ordered almost everything on the menu because our group was so big, everything I tried was really really good! But my favorites were the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Awesome Noodles with beef.  This place is a great example of what they are trying to do DTLV to revitalize the area, I will definitely be back.  MY GO-TO: I don't think you can go wrong here... But I would get the Pork Jerky, Short Rib Fried Rice and Awesome Noodles!",

    "text": "Drunken, awesome, pad, no matter what style these noodles are cooked in they are spectacular!  Working downtown this may be one of my, if not the, favorite place to get lunch from.  I generally go with the beef so I still have yet to try the pork and chicken.  It's nice and small with a nice little courtyard to eat in the back so as you can imagine it gets pretty full at lunch so arrive before noon or prepare to wait.  Heck if you order it, it may take a while.    The one thing I'm sad to mention is their spice levels may be too much for me.  The first time I ordered the drunken noodles I went with a 3 thinking that I'd be alright since I'm used it.  Wrong answer, I think I spent more time blowing my nose and drinking water than actually eating, still delicious though.  I usually go with a 2 now so I can still get some spiciness yet still enjoy my meal.  The last time though I went with the awesome noodles at a level of 2 and all of a sudden it left like too much.  So there may be a consistency issue or I've become more of a wuss.  Then again I do notice a lot of chili seeds in there so maybe I'm not a wuss?  Wait, don't answer that!   Either way, the noodles are tasty, the meat succulent, and the various vegetables placed in the different dishes are the perfect compliments for the meal.  I still need to go ahead and try out the curry and other dishes but the drunken and awesome noodles are so good it's hard to convince myself to try anything else!",

I really like what they did with this space, though I must admit I don't remember what used to be here.  Lord knows I've stumbled by enough times on my way to/from the Cortez.  Ordered the Three Color Curry (level 4) and a Singha.  The waitress used an Iphone to take my order, gotta love technology.  Some Aussie plopped down next to me, ordered Pad Thai from a different dude (w/o an Iphone), and wolfed down his Pad Thai before I even received my entree.  So much for technology.  To be fair, the Aussie consumed his Pad Thai in about 90 seconds.  I guess the Pad Thai must be good!  The Three Color Curry was very tasty, although I wish it would have had more kick.  Solid food and fair prices.  And they're open late, which is nice after a long night of gambling and drinking downtown.    Recommend.",

    "text": "So, a month ago I would have five starred this place but my last experience gave me a bad taste but not from the food! I have been to le Thai,at least ten times. I love the pad see ew, the green curry, and awesome noodles. Even their spiked thai tea is delicious. I dont mind having to wait an hour since you can wander off to container park and they will text you when your table is ready!   However, my last visit was tarnished by less than stellar service. After waiting an hour we were seated on the back patio. About halfway through my meal I requested a second spiked thai tea. After I had finished my meal, it still hadnt come. 30 minutes after I ordered it the waiter showed up at the table apologizing stating that the bar was super busy. At that point I just canceled the order and asked for the check. The check was paid in under 10 minutes and we were getting ready to leave when the hostess came to our table and asked us to move to another bar area because she had a group that had been waiting for 30 minutes for a table!!! Well maybe we would have been gone 30 min earlier if I hadnt been waiting for my drink! And by the way... we waited an hour! How embarrasing to be treated like that! Too bad I had already given a 20 percent tip! Oh and on the way out.... not a single solitary soul was at the bar. My guess? The waiter forgot and then tried to cover his tracks with a lie.",

The inside of the restaurant is a hole in the wall with the back patio being much larger equipped with water misters to cool you down during a hot summer night. Started off with a Thai ice tea which are gigantic here. I tried the Thai style wings which everyone raved about and they didn't disappoint. The portion was large and the dipping sauce was yummy. For my main entree I went with the Basil pork #2 spiciness which was not very spicy by flavorful. The portion was large and I could only eat half of the bowl.  I can't say enough about my waitress Panissara - she was awesome, friendly and constantly checked in to make sure I was taken cared of!

Even worse, parties seated after us got their food before ours! Disgusting service spoilt the night for us. Bottomline: AVOID this place",

    "text": "Overall, a good experience during a late lunch. I am a huge Thai food fan. We went during happy hour and got a deal on the appetizer chicken satay, only $6. You could eat it for a whole meal. You get four pieces of chicken, peanut sauce and a cucumber salad. We also ordered the three color curry. I have never had that before and the server mentioned it was a special they made just at Le Thai. I would highly recommend it. it was spicy, so we ordered a 0 on a 0-5 scale for spicy. I normally like my thai food about a 2-3 for spicy so this was perfect.   It was on Freemont street so you go a few blocks either direction and the neighborhood was sketchy, so parking was a little tricky. But it worked out for us close to the restaurant.",

    "text": "Le Thai is a cool little Thai venue in Downtown Las Vegas but was a little disappointed after perhaps too high expectations.    Coming right before the Life is Beautiful Festival began, my friend and I stopped by around noon on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get bar seats.  The place isn't huge but has a small outdoor patio area as well as tables and a few bar seats.  A full bar awaited as well with a great selection of various Thai-inspired cocktails and Asian beers/wines.    So for the taste.  Drinks-wise, we both got the Spiked Thai Iced Tea which I thought was clever.  Taste-wise, I was a little more disappointed as the whiskey I believe overpowered the totality of the Thai Iced tea here.  Maybe it needed more of the Thai Iced Tea but the balance was a bit off.    Food-wise, they have a bunch of normal Thai dishes like the papaya salads and yellow curry.  I got the awesome flat noodle (which reminded me most of the pad see ewe mixed with the pad thai type of ingredients).  It came with a choice of protein (I got chicken) and the end taste was okay.  It wasn't too different from most Thai joints and I had to add a lot of spices to get it up to what I did want.  (They did also ask for a level of 1-5 spicy level which isn't always common in Thai restaurants).  The best thing I did have was the roti omlette dessert which was absolutely delicious.  Filled with nutella and a fried egg on top of a bread on the bottom, it was a solid dessert.    Service-wise, everyone was really nice and accommodating, even with all the busy atmosphere.    Venue-wise, I loved the look and atmosphere of the place.  It had a very silly take on Thai food that wasn't too serious and liked the interplay.     Cost-wise, it was very affordable with the check only about $20 per person in the end.    Again, Le Thai was pretty cool (more of a 3 1/2 stars) but taste-wise, I wasn't fully convinced in my first visit.  Hope to come back and try it again and be proven wrong in the near future.",

I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, I didn't want to hype it up before I even taste the food. I truly believe that Lotus of Siam is the best Thai food in the country, the whole entire United States of America, that's how good Lotus of Siam is, very hard to compete.   It's a cute little spot, very small, the restaurant, kitchen & bar is literally like the size of my bedroom. They have a front patio area and a back patio area, they sat us at the side bar in the back, I didn't realize it was open air, it was over 100 degrees outside so they had the misters going, which is great to cool us down but then we're moist, the food is moist, my glasses got fogged up, it was a hot mess back there.  Then the club next door started tuning their instruments, and it got louder, and louder, to the point we couldn't even hear each other talk anymore.   Let's talk about the food, that's why we're here in the first place. The shrimp pad thai was good, was it the best? No, sadly it wasn't. The beef salad was alright, needed a lot of lime juice. We gave it a try and it just wasn't our kind of place, sorry Lotus is still the best of the best.",

The food itself was on part with other places, but not outstanding. The reason for the low rating is simple - the entire customer service experience was terrible.  We started with the hostess who was preoccupied with her phone and barely acknowledged that there were customers waiting to be seated. Once we did get the attention of iPhone girl, we were told there were no tables but we could place a to go order and sit on the empty patio. We ordered one entree, a soft drink and a cocktail.  The cocktail was ok, but the bartender messed up the soft drink. Ok, it happens.  We waited the stated 20 minutes for our food. Nothing. Waited a little longer but I saw orders waiting in the window. I assumed those were phone orders waiting for pickup. I inquired about our food and got the dish that had been in the window for at least 20 minutes. So, yeah, I won't be heading there anytime soon. No recommendation to anyone else.",

There's indoor and outdoor, but remember you're on Fremont so if you sit outside it is going to be loud. I sat in their outdoor seating, call it what you will but if there's not an actual roof up over my head then i'm outside. On that note i think they are next to an open mic night club where it gets ridiculously loud. What did i hear exactly? Well i'll tell you this, i did not know whether to stay in my seat and wait for my food, or forget the food and start lurking on girls that look like they're from a Nikki Minaj video.   Now for the food and service. The server was great but the order took some time to get to our table. Water is the most basic to be served, in fact that was our first order. Somehow the server decided to bring that last... Some of our food was cold and had a different after taste from other variations of Thai food I've had. It's not bad I just didn't like it.   Final words    I do not regret coming here, it would take a lot to make me regret something. My friend has been wanting to take me here and we still managed to enjoy our time. This restaurant has way more potential and I hope they do make some changes. If not then there are always other places that serve Thai food late at night and have more of a music selection other than Nikki Minaj-esque music.",

    "text": "At first I was a tad timid about the majority of the restaurant being an outdoor venue in June in Vegas. But, then a wall of mist hit me like a shower of rain pedals. Not an inch of the patio wasn't covered with the cool water. Once I cooled down my appetite set in. The menu offering pad see ew, pad thai, and my favorite - the awesome noodles was one tasty looking dish after another. The awesome noodles are...well...awesome! Essentially, it's delicious noodles soaked in a spicy, soy based sauce, but instead of smaller egg noodles in Pad Thai, they are fatter and wider, oh - did I mention, they are delicious? The appetizers were equally as good as the awesome noodles. LIke the chicken wings: spicy with a crispy skin and accompanied with a spicy sauce of which I have never had the pleasure of tasting. Now - Out of all the things in Vegas, I find myself wanting to return Sin City for the Awesome Noodles.",

Food was hot and steaming all around us as servers rushed to the tables. Plates flying and people laughing and general organized chaos. In other words, fun and hoppin'! I ordered the short rib fried rice and the flavors were amazing - some of the best fried rice I've had! The chicken satay was delicious with a slight kick and my friends' dishes, crab fried rice and ga pow, were also amazing. Everything arrived piping hot and bursting with flavor.

When eating such food I might myself comforted by the style of cooking, the authenticity and very often the atmosphere of the eatery.  On a very recent visit to Las Vegas I discovered this wonderful restaurant in downtown a block or two from the Fremont entertainment hub.  I can say with very little reservation that the Gai Pow I had (dinner serving for lunch) is the best I have had in Las Vegas or for that matter In my hometown of Scottsdale.  Finely ground beef cooked with bell peppers and onions served with rice.  The beef was cooked to perfection: tender and moist with a little bit of the cooked juices swirling around the mound of ground beef. Well seasoned and with my choice of level of spicyness.  The place was full yet service was friendly, prompt and with follow up.  Eating solo I chose to sit at the bar and was very impressed with how the bartender chose to check with each of us how the food was and if we were enjoying it.  This is what comfort is all about.",

Both indoor and outdoor seating, about $10-$15 a plate, depending on what you order. We got some curry and pad thai, along with drinks and and some appetizers and it came out to around $40 without tip.  Servers are on point making sure you have refills and you can see the kitchen from some of the seats. If you get a taller dude for a server, don't recall his name, he's damn good at his job. Friendly and attentive, hope you get the pleasure of being served by him.  All in all, would recommend to someone looking for Thai around Fremont St!",

The beef Panang was absolutely delicious, the sauce - so flavorful and tasty! The Angel wings, the Pad Thai, the House fried rice was absolutely delicious! Oh and don't forget the Tom Yum soup!!

This time my friend and I sat at the bar and received great service from Ashley. Plus we got to watch the game as well on their flat screen tv. I would describe this place as very hip and cozy. Not many indoor seating. There's an outdoor area but it's way too hot right now to be out there and suffering XD.  Thai food is absolutely my favorite cuisine. I could eat it everyday. Their short rib fried rice is phenomenal ! At first , I was skeptical ordering it because I thought it would be just plain fried rice , but everyone there kept insisting us to try it and I'm glad they did. I have also tried their three color curry , spicy eggplant , Thai style wings , and pad Thai so far. Everything here is great but their short rib fried rice was definitely my favorite out of all. Get their Thai iced tea to accompany your meal (they even have spiked Thai iced tea).  I'm a fire eater so I always like ordering a 5 out of 5 spice level , but to spare my friend I got a 4 instead (but he was still dying :P). So I would suggest ordering a \"2\" if you just want medium spice.  Tip: Only street parking 2$/hour meters.",

I've had a lot of Thai food, and while it is fairly odd for Las Vegas food, it was still very good.  Chicken Pad Thai: Was good, but not amazing. Just like any other Pad Thai. It was probably the worst dish out of the 3 we ordered. That's not to say it was bad at all. It's just that the other 2 dishes were good and better, while this was just okay.  3 Color Curry: This was very good, and ordered with Spice level 2. I could taste the flavors from all 3 curries (red, yellow, green). Was very flavorful and I would order it again.   Short Rib Fried Rice: This was the best item we ordered, and was agreed by the rest of my family as well. I don't usually get to say a food is \"life-changing\" very often, but this honestly was, as cliche as it sounds! Everything about this dish was good and flavorful. It was so good that we want to try making it at home! The 3 of us were sharing each of the 3 dishes, but all of us were continuously trying to get more of this fried rice. This dish was memorable and I don't get to say that about many foods. If I ever come back here, I'm definitely ordering this!  Thai Tea: Got it for a bogo Check-In. Thai Tea, need I say more?",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed this small cute half indoor half outdoor restaurant. In the summer months the indoor seats are really hard to get. If you sit outside, the roof is covered in a net that blocks out some of the heat. They also spray a cool water mist to cool you off that reminds me of being at an amusement park.   They have good lunch specials here. Not as good as chinatown but they knock off a dollar or two on the regular pricing that brings it to 10 bucks. I've tried the drunken noodles, curries, eggplant basil, pad Thai, and pad see ew. Everything is very flavorful ( although sometimes too salty). You can adjust the spice level. I always order everything in a mild or medium and did fine with the heat. The one dish that I don't like here is the pad Thai. That's supposed to be the staple dish in every restaurant but it's the one I like the least here. It's not like traditional pad Thai. The color is a little off and is definitely lacking in taste. The noodles were also super mushy and breaks into tiny pieces.   I would definitely come back if I'm craving thai food in the downtown Fremont area.",

    "text": "OMG!!! The short rib fried rice was the absolute truth.  I made a special trip there after having reached my hotel's destination at the Hughes Center. I found them on Yelp and when I saw the pictures and read the reviews, I knew I had to try it. Good lawd, the flavors were something I've never experienced before. Now, my dish didn't look as good as the ones I saw online; therefore, I wasn't visually attracted to it but baby, when I got that first fork full, I just about lost my mind.  I took pics but somehow they mysteriously disappeared. I'll post new ones when I go back lol.  The only word I can find to describe it is, ahhhhmazing! Okay, so that's not a word but you get my drift.  Anyway, I got mine with brown rice which is probably why it didn't resemble the other pics but shucks, I was overjoyed that it actually tasted better than it looked. At first, I balked at the price as it was a little over $14; it is well worth every penny. They do give you a generous amount of food.  I've got two more days here in Vegas and oh how I wish they were a franchise lol.  I'll definitely be revisiting before leaving.  Once you go Thai, you can't go back Chinese.",

    "text": "We had read a lot about LeThai and the experience here was bad, the food is passable and is not really what one would call Thai Food, no where close to it. We went there on a weekday evening and had a 60 minute wait, we came back in 60 minutes and were offered a table. The Service was prompt but the food a failure.  We ordered 1 x Spring Rolls [Egg Rolls], a Thai Red Curry Veggies (With Extra Vegetables), and a Thai Red Curry Pork [With Extra Vegetables]... The Spring Rolls came soaking in oil, as if they had been fried cold - they were not prepared fresh and seemed like they came out of a packet. The saving grace was the bottle of Sriracha that helped us over ride the taste of oil.  The Thai Curries were requested as Extra Spicy, but were no where close to what a Thai Curry is. The Base ingredients were not chosen properly, and it was missing both Lemon Grass as well as Kafir Lime leaves that are valuable ingredients to make a Thai Curry. It was also served with plain boiled rice, while there is always a suggestion of using a jasmine flower or a lemon when boiling rice to add fragrance to it.  Overall, I would not recommend this place, well if you are in the mood for greasy food and you don't know what Thai Food is about - go ahead, but if you are serious about your food, take a cab and get to Thai Street Food Cafe, the total bill will still be less, including the Cab Fare and you would actually get better food.",

    "text": "After finding out Lotus of Siam did not open until dinner time on a Saturday morning, my friends and I came to Le Thai because of the high reviews and our craving for Thai food after a long night of clubbing. It is located near the arts district in Down Town Las Vegas and there was already a 30-45 minute wait at noon. The restaurant is small and there is only street parking, which was $2/hr.   Although the employees were very friendly and accommodating, I have to give this place a 3/5 stars because I have definitely have had cheaper and better Thai food. It was less authentic and more Americanized. The restaurant had a cute hipster vibe to it with an outside back patio, but all in all the place felt like a tourist destination.  What we ordered:  - 3 Color Curry: Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu/Shrimp ($12/$14): It's a blend of red, yellow, and green curry with vegetables and a side of brown or white rice. Good, but I would recommend the lunch portion. - Pad See Ewe (Noodle): Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu ($13). This was probably the only dish I would be able to finish by itself out of everything we ordered. Recommend. - Pad Thai (Noodle): Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu ($13). Very dry and bland compared to the Pad See Ewe. Even after we added more sauce. - Tom Yum: Option of either Chicken, Tofu, or Shrimp ($10). It's a Thai style hot & sour soup with mushroom, tomato, lemon grass and lemon juice, topped with green onions and cilantro. I would recommend the tofu after trying both the tofu and chicken soup. This soup is perfect to cleanse your palette if you're getting tired of whatever entree you ordered.",

Our group tried the Thai Wings (BOMB--don't even think about it, just get them), crab rangoon (your typical American Asian fare), Crispy Spring Rolls (nom nom) for apps. The Thai style wings are not too spicy for your non-spice loving friends, but still interesting enough for those who crave heat.  Entrees--ones that stood out were the Short Rib Fried Rice (shockingly tender short rib melts in your mouth), Ga Pow (I can't even describe to you what makes this dish so good--I think the flavors just meld together in an awesome way.)  They brought out what I think was the Roti for my friend's birthday. It tasted a little too egg-y for my preference, but it was good.  Definitely coming back!",

I will tell you though Le thai was one of the reasons why I was excited for thai food in Thailand, and yet nothing compared.   The Pad Se Ewu, Awesome Flat noodle, and Shrimp Stir Fry are among my favorite dishes here.   If you want to try something different and hearty, opt for the Tri Colored Shrimp Noodle Curry.

After slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water - is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter - I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods.  Our roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it - we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor.   The curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change - I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS.   I've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre-med, and they've managed to move on.",

Le Thai a tiny Thai place sits on this road with a bright sign that is hard to miss. The food was yummy especially if you have a late night craving for spice. I had their specialty short rib fried rice. I was thinking that the short ribs were served on the side but it was actually little bits of rib meat in the rice. It was delicious! I also couldn't resist the fried spring rolls to go along with my meal.   It's a cute place. We sat in the patio which was a little warm but it was a cozy spot. The seating inside was also small but it wasn't too crowded since we came into eat after midnight. Love when places are open late night!",

Both drinks weren't particularly tasty. We ordered the tom kha, don't be fooled by the low numbers! My husband wasn't having a hard time with level 2. My favorite dish was the awesome noodles.

I'll keep it simple:  *The Awesome Noodles are aptly named. *The Three Color Curry is deserving of it's legendary dish status & cult-like following. *Like Pad Thai? They've got a world-class version, but I would suggest trying the Awesome Noodles if you haven't had 'em yet. (You can order Pad Thai next time.) *The Wings (a new menu item) are brined & fried and are the new benchmark of chicken-fried. *Brown Rice IS available (this can be a dealbreaker when choosing restaurants.)  I am not a paid promoter nor have I received free food in exchange for Tweets (a la Robin Leach). I just love good, consistent food. And Le Thai nails that, every single time. 5 enthusiastic stars!",

If you're in Vegas and you're sick of stuffing your face with buffet or expensive strip food, definitely head downtown and give this place a try.  It's pretty small so I would recommend making a reservation if you have a large party, otherwise you'll be waiting over an hour to be seated.

The waitress was fast and efficient, when we ordered the stock questions was on a scale to 1-5, how spicy? We all said 3, but next time I would say 4 absolutely! It needed a bit more heat!  They do get busy, and are really small, so plan on the possibility of waiting a bit. The hostess told us 20 minutes, but it was about 5. Love that!  I had the Chicken Basil saute, it was good but tasted the other dishes on the table and their dishes were better! The red curry was AMAZING!! And as cliche as it is, the Pad Thai was really great as well!!!  If you are hungry and in the area - go check it out!",

There is a little waiting area outside with a window so you can order drinks. So feel free to come on cool day or a nice evening just to hang out before your meal. You must have the majority of your party there ON TIME or they will give away your table and you will have to start all over again. Annoying but they have have such a high volume, they have to.  The place is very clean which I liked. They have a small inside area with a little bar. Very intimate area. Then they have a patio outback with a beautiful art piece painted on the wall. The bathrooms are located outside. I was shocked on how clean they are even for being outside.   Service: fantastic. We order a bottle which came in a ice bucket. We also had water which we went through extremely fast each time but never worries since they were so quick to refill them.   Food: I was not a fan of the crab rangoons. I've had better at other restaurants. But the spring rolls are delicious. I know they have vegan ones too if you ask. This place is vegan to carnivore friendly. Spice level run from 1-5. I love spicy so I order a 4 for the tofu eggplant stir fry. Some thought it was a little too spicy. Just perfect amount of spicy and sweet for me. My sister order a chick pad thai. She loved it. You can pretty much order a few things and share them all. Most likely you will have leftovers too. The price matches the quality.  Overall, this place a must try for DT. This is one of my favorite food spots when I come down here.",

While I've heard service can be slow, I was lucky. Prince was working. Prince knows how to hustle, and how to take care of customers. Prince...is awesome!   But while good service is always nice, the big bowl of Panang Curry made it worth all the hassle to try and get here for lunch, to find a space in the El Cortez parking garage and run through the casino and all the people just to get a great lunch and then get back in an hour. Yes, it was soooo good and so worth it.   And yes, this is the first business that seems to have a tie to Tony Hsieh that didn't suck for me.   Will I be back? Hell yes and I want to bring others. I liked LeThai, and the first impression is that the reviews are not hype, they're legit.   Oh and they got the spice just right. Again Thank You Prince for asking the right questions and making sure I was taken good care of. And the Thai Iced Tea was good too. The place is a little intimate when it's busy so it's not for the shy, but the food will make the shy forget about that soon enough.   But as good as LeThai is...Penns Thai House still kicks LeThai's rear end. Seriously.   (Appropriately enough, Thai food gets Review #499.)",

I went in with really high expectations because the guy I was there with on a date said it was the best place in Vegas, but I wasn't that impressed.   Service - They sat us at a counter right next to the kitchen. Every time someone walked in or yelled at the chef, we were in the middle of it. It was a little annoying. The staff was friendly, but it was slow.   Food - We ordered the Green Curry and the Pad Thai. The Green Curry was good, and the shrimp were succulent. The Pad Thai was not good. Pad Thai is my favorite Thai dish, but I did not like theirs. I would definitely not order it again.  I would be willing to try this place again, but it may be awhile.",

The Tom Yum is sorta like a hot and sour soup (but better) that contains mushrooms, green onions, cilantro, tomato, lemon grass, and lemon juice. And for $10, it's not too bad considering it's huge and can easily feed two people. Other standouts are the ga pow, papaya salad, chicken satay, and fried bananas. The interior is cute but cramped and can get loud at times. Overall, a great spot to have lunch or a meal before hitting up the bars along Fremont.",

When I heard there was a 60 minute wait on a Monday night in Downtown, I thought \"you gotta be kidding me?\"  But a large format bottle of sake quickly mollified me.  Besides, you can get anything off the menu from the to-go window outside,  so 15 minutes later I was eating a couple appetizers.  There weren't many vegetarian options, so I ordered spring rolls with GREAT trepidation, because, are spring rolls EVER good?  No!   They are NEVER, EVER good.  They're only occasionally not terrible.  They're like the Thai equivalent of mozzarella sticks.  Except at this place.  These weren't just not terrible, they were TERRIFIC.  As in, has every other spring roll I've ever had prior just been deep fried crab grass?  Because THESE were golden, crispy PERFECTION.  They were like MDMA dipped in cocaine served on a silver salver of multiple orgasms.  For my main course I had a level 3 yellow curry.  Pretty much my go to order at an unfamiliar Thai restaurant.    Except, now, having eaten their yellow curry, I don't think I will EVER be able to go-to another yellow curry again.  This yellow curry was so fucking amazing that my taste buds will probably go all Norma Rae on my mouth if ever attempt to feed them anything but this sweet, spicy, NECTAR OF THE GODS.  The service was likely very good and the decor was probably too, but I really can't say for sure because I spent the next hour basically awash in serotonin and dopamine.   They should be handing out cards to this place on the Strip along with those glosssy pictures of strippers and escorts.",

I always go in the afternoons, it's not as busy as the nights.

    "text": "Le Thai arrives in downtown Vegas with good thai food and a lot of spice, but they forgot to add customer service.  Drop Le Thai in Las Vegas Koreatown and it would be a decent 3 star thai place.  It'd be good, but not award winning.  But in the culinary wasteland of downtown Vegas, Le Thai stands out as one of the best restaurant options.  Problem is, the customer service goes in manic waves between friendly and passive-aggressively rude.  First, the food.  I've eaten most of the menu and there are some real winning dishes.  The tri-color curry is solid.  Combining red, green, and yellow curry in coconut milk is surprisingly tasty.  If curry isn't your bag, go for the \"awesome noodles,\" which are . . . well, f**kin' awesome.  The sweet and spicy flavor is rich and blends perfectly with the noodles and the load of vegetables that come in the dish.  The cooks do a great job with cooking the meat in the dishes -- it will be tender and well-seasoned.    This place is serious about its spice, by the way.  A 3 out of 5 will have your nose running and you'll be asking for more rice to cool down your tongue.  The pad thai is just decent.  I've heard some folks rave about it, but I wasn't blown away.  I'd come back and order it when I'm in the mood for pad thai and stuck downtown, but it's far from impressive.  The beef and meatball soup is similarly mediocre.  It tastes like a bland pho.   As for the problem with customer service: go there during a slow period of the day/night and you'll probably have a good experience.  But when the place gets busy, the staff can't handle it.  On at least 2 occasions, I've come in when the tables are full and the staff was busy.  The first time it was this busy, one staff member told me to stand by the bar and put an order in so my meal would be ready earlier.  Another came over to the bar and rudely told us that we were in her way, could not order in advance, and that we would need to wait outside.  Another time, the staff handled a busy day by ignoring us for very long periods of time.  Bottom line: some of the best food in downtown, but the staff can be downright rude  [3.5 stars for the food minus 1 star for poor customer service]",

I highly recommend it.   My friend had the Panang Curry w/Tofu. That is my next order (which I plan on getting this week). Again it had a great flavor profile, everything was fresh and on point.

The stock was wonderful.  The seasonings were right on, and the top had a good number of mushrooms slices floating on it.  I think it needed some more chicken, but for the price, it was quite good the way it was.  As others have noted, this is a very small place. About ten tables in a small area with two side seating bars each holding 5 people.  It's a pleasant space with nice wicker chairs.  Service was quick and pleasant.

SO definitely not suitable for children + families with kids.  Their Tom Yum soup- level 2 spiciness was rather spicy! so I cannot imagine how their level 5 would taste! the soup got cold quick!!! they should use one of those metal hot pots with the burning flame in the center.   Their Thai Salad was not bad.  Their garlic fried rice was okay, tasted a bit on the sweet side!   Their desserts! NO, no, NO! It was made completely wrong... I grew up eating at various thai restaurants, and many are Authentic tasting... this place is definitely not it.   Sour, light yellow colored mango with no little barely there coconut sauce.  The Roti... just no.   Food 2 stars, service 5 stars!!",

We started with LARB which is basically a chicken lettuce wrap- Thai style and it was my favorite! Ground chicken with fresh herbs and lime juice - yummmay - just bursts with a bouquet of flavors in your mouth. I'm going to try and make it this weekend I liked it so much. Way better than Pei Wei or PFs.  Next we shared YELLOW CURRY chicken which is my standard Thai order (level 5 heat was just on the edge of too spicy but right for me) and an order of the DRUNKEN NOODLEs with beef. Both were mouthwatering. Portions were great, we took some home for later.  Service was also excellent. Only downside is the location, of course parking downtown sucks and is exceptionally crowded at lunch time. Restaurant is small so get there early.  Definitely some of the best Thai food in town!",

    "text": "Let me get something out of the way first, so it doesn't cloud my judgement while I write the rest of this review: if you think tracked lighting is an appropriate choice you are wrong. There is never, EVER, a proper time to use tracked lighting. Tracked lighting is the worst possible answer to literally every question in the universe, EXCEPT the question of which lighting solution is the worst possible lighting solution in the universe. I spent my entire meal trying to position my head in a way that would shade my eyes just enough to have a conversation with my wife. Tracked lighting, I hate you.  Now that I have that out of the way, know that it doesn't affect my rating at all. That's just helpful feedback for perhaps the business owner to take to heart.  The short rib fried rice was awesome. That's what my wife ordered. I would have ordered two more of those for myself to go if I was going to give up on life and my wardrobe. Seriously, it was very, very good.   Unfortunately, it isn't enough. I had to send my first entree back, and its replacement, while better, was still not good. Our appetizers were also very short on flavor. The two entrees I had were both curry dishes, the second was chicken panang which is one of my Thai food favorites. The entree it replaced was quite flavorless, and the chicken was undercooked. The panang itself had an excellent sauce, but the chicken was also undercooked and poorly seasoned. The sauce on its own is not enough to make that dish.  The appetizer we got was also a chicken dish. It had the same problem: slightly undercooked chicken making it tough and with a slight aftertaste, very under-seasoned leaving it without much flavor of its own.  The common thread here seems to be that nobody in this place knows how to properly cook and season chicken. As I said, the short rib fried rice was delicious.  My last problem is that, when asked how spicy from 1 to 5, I said \"10. Make it spicy. I want to sweat as soon as I take my first bite.\" I got a dish that I wouldn't have considered to be \"spicy\" at all. On a 1-5 scale it would be a 0, an opt-out, a substitution of no spicy at all.  This is all so unfortunate, because I've heard a lot of good things about this place. It may have been an off night or a new cook. The service was very good but the seating wasn't great (tracked lighting!) and every time the door opened my wife was blasted with very very cold air. I will give this place a second try but not until it warms up outside and I can sit in the outdoor portion of the restaurant.",

The reason I gave Le Thai a 4 star vs 5 star is due to the service I received there today.  I am not an unreasonable or unpleasant customer as I have waited tables in my college years and know it's not an easy job however: 1.  Our waiter took his break in the middle of our visit and failed to properly hand us off to another waiter.  2. During the break we ordered soup (which is typically large enough for 4 adults - we ordered 2 of these) and when the soup was brought to our table, no additional bowls for serving everyone, none were provided.  We had to ask twice to get enough for everyone. 3.  When spooning out the soup into a bowl, some of it spilled on my hand and I received a 2nd degree burn.  Despite informing my waiter (once he returned from his break) and receiving ice to help with the pain, no apologies were offered and I would have thought at least the manager would stop by the table - nope.    Bottom line:  Food is amazing - get take out or delivery.  :)",

    "text": "It's not that I was avoiding this place, it's that there are lots of Thai options easier to get to than Downtown. The fact that I ended up there last night was based solely on two facts- it was too late to cook and I had been gifted a gift certificate. In a way, this is now a problem, because it so damn good I am going to fuss with heading downtown for it more often.  The vegan options were unbelievably incredible. Clearly marked and the sever who took my order knew his stuff, redirecting me when I nearly ordered something that was not vegan. Our final order ended up being the Masaman Curry, Spicy Eggplant, and Drunken Noodles (Pad See Ew).  I've never had a spicy eggplant dish before, mostly regulating eggplant to the breaded variety slathered in marinara or tucked safely into moussaka. This dish changed my mind. The texture was unreal, and the sauce was both sweet and savory and a bit spicy too, a full-bodied umami flavor. I cannot rave enough about how good it was.  The masaman curry was going to be a shoe-in, because what reputable Thai restaurant doesn't have a killer curry? Loaded with tender carrots and potatoes and all manner of vegetables, it was as satisfying and decadent as you would need it to be to truly say you're a curry eater. Same goes for the Drunken Noodles.   This place is absolutely worth the hype,, and deserves far more dedicated dining on your behalf than a hapazard stop in after a boozy night. Go during the day to fully appreciate the complex flavors their dishes have to offer for vegans!",

They do have a lunch menu that runs every day (except Sunday) from 11-3 for $9.95, but the portions are a little bit smaller. I would also check the receipt carefully as they tried to overcharge us for adding both beef and shrimp to the pad kee mao.  I do like that they offered brown rice without an additional charge, and the food was decent, but nothing I would go out of my way for.  Parking: metered around the corner  UPDATE: Response to owner's comment below. That's a lot of math for a simple meal, of which was not explained by the server when we ordered shrimp and beef. No one asked which is a \"main\" and which is an \"add on.\"",

I had the short rib fried rice, chicken satay and cucumber salad, everything was great. My girl had the three curry and loved it too.  The Thai tea was very good, never had Thai tea before, shocked me how much it tasted like an orange creamsicle! Wow.  I'll be back here for sure. It's a fairly small place, only saw about 12-15 tables, so get there early, or save a seat thru the yelp app. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "So disappointed we weren't able to eat here despite the high reviews! This review is based on the waitlist experience and the staff's inability to solve guest opportunities. We checked into Le Thai on the Yelp waitlist (quoted a 27-39 minute wait on Yelp), and then stopped by the hostess stand about 5-10 minutes after adding ourselves to the list to check in as the restaurant requested. The hostess confirmed that the wait should be about 27-39 minutes and were told we would be texted when the table was ready. We then didn't hear anything back after 30 minutes, so we stopped by the hostess stand to check on the table status. The hostess said we still have 4 parties ahead of us and should be another 20 minutes or so. When we questioned it further the hostess didn't have any explanation on the extended wait time other than that some tables seem to be closing out checks but didn't know how much longer our wait would be.   After then being quoted one thing and then being told another, we left. The staff didn't really seem to have a grasp of seating and setting expectations. And we didn't want to waste our vacation waiting on a table for who knows how long.. There's too many restaurant choices in this area, so we took our business elsewhere.",

    "text": "If your a foodie in Las Vegas and you want AMAING Thai food you go to Lotos of Siam.  If your a local and want AMAZING Thai food you go to Lucki Thai..... if your downtown and want ok Thai food you go here....Because  it is located in downtown Las Vegas.... which is the worst part of town!  You encounter pan handlers and the basic trash of Vegas as you go to the front door. So strike one...the restaurant is tiny (maybe 15 seats inside) and not terribly clean even in time trash can in the ladies room there is graffiti.  Maybe that is their \"motif\" who knows....Then let's talk about the patio, which they call the \"beer garden\" Well it was an outdoor space they \"enclosed\" so when their neighbor has a band your in the middle of their noise.... so the patio is so loud you can't hear one another.  Strike 2. Then we waited for 55 minutes to eat here....are you kidding me?  So when we got to the hostess she told us the wait time and said you could walk and she would text or call us and said there is a cool bar around the corner and sent our party to a bar 4 blocks away in the wrong direction.  I know Downtown and it's seedy at best.  I told our friends that was a bad idea to walk that far away especially at night in the dark. So we waited at another spot two doors down.  So the hostess was to call or text us when our table was ready. Well thought it was about time so we walked back and when it did we were told that they sent us the message 10 minutes  ago and we did not respond and our table had been given away. If we had not been with friends I WOULD NEVER have waited for this dump in the first place.  Strike 3!     I would have given them a 1 star but the wait staff (not the hostess) were very nice and the food was fast and fairly well done.  So we had pad Thai, which the noodles were light and the sauce was nice.  Then the beef fried rice (I tasted the egg before realizing they ordered beef fried rice and I don't eat beef) and the flavor was good.  Then we had the Tom yum soup which was light and well seasoned  and finally the curry which had good flavors but not very spicy.  The food is overly salty as we had to drink water all night to compensate for the salt.    But was it so special  that I would go back.  NO actually never is a better statement.  Drive down Spring Mountain and pick any Thai restaurant and you could have the same meal without the riff raff of the Vegas strip.  And to top it off as we went to get our car the police stopped traffic in front of us and took a man into custody in the middle of the street.  It is not the Wynn kids... way too seedy for me.",

I could pour that over anything! 2nd dish- short rib fried rice 5/5 omg. A must try. Only regret I didnt get a fried egg on top  Second visit Lunch specials for 9.95 each and comes with white or brown rice. 3 color curry i am not much of curry fan but my husband loved it 4/5. Ga pow w/chicken 5/5 my new favorite dish. The broth was outstanding. Too much bell pepper for my liking but they will substitute with broccoli if you ask.   Next time you are downtown, check them out. You will not be disappointed. Awesome service and great staff.",

The rest of the dishes were frankly, just decent.  Maybe a little greasy.  Nothing really stands out enough to write about--but that short rib fried rice, though!  You get to say what your \"spice level\" will be, on a scale of 1-5.  The Thai Iced Tea is refreshing on a warm day.  But the atmosphere, especially if you sit outside on their back, enclosed patio, is quite neat, especially in the summer.  There is a cool, Warholesque quality to this place, that feels a little like you came upon an exclusive, urban garden party that you have to be \"in the know\" to have been granted admission.  There could be a good number of professionals eating here, as downtown is host to any number of white collar professionals.  But I am thinking that a lot of tourists are coming to find this place, as it is walking distance to the Fremont Street Experience.",

The basis chicken  was lovely and it had ground chicken which was great.  The curry was good too.  We had it with noodles which was nice.  My only complaint would be it didn't have a ton of chicken in it.   Seems like most curries are like this.  But the taste was great.

We were promptly greeted and seated and served by a friendly and attentive individual.  The prices here as compared to dining on the strip is like night and day. We had yummy cocktails and the food was carefully prepared and just plain delicious.  The interior of the restaurant is clean and most importantly the tables are not close together.   We are so happy to have discovered Le Thai on our last visit to Vegas. We highly recommend and look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Le Thai for quite a while, and had the opportunity after seeing a show at the Smith Center. We put our name on the waitlist through the Yelp app after getting out of the theater, and it said there'd be a 30-45 minute wait. Not a problem, since we had to drive to Fremont and find a place to park.  For the second time in a row, a rocky start turned into a really good experience. The 45 minute wait became 50, and we were told that our table would be ready as soon as the couple sitting there settled their bill. That didn't happen right away. And then they seated a party of 10. They said that if they seated us, we'd have to wait for our food, since the kitchen would be overwhelmed by the large party. We would have left if the time weren't already late, with many restaurants in the area already closed. So they expected us to wait on the bench instead of sitting at our table. But then they changed their minds, and invited us to be seated and snack on peanuts.  Luckily, it was uphill from there. The spicy peanuts were addictive. The service was exceptional, especially from Aaron, who was personable and chatty - we love interacting with our waiters. While I was enjoying my glass of bubbly, I noticed that the menu, which seemed smaller than many other Thai restaurants, had some interesting items that were new to me. Smaller can be better. (And that was clarified by an article I read about Anthony Bourdain just today, which said that if the menu is too big, turn and run the other way!)   We started with the Larb salad, which we ordered chopped instead of with the  whole lettuce leaves. It arrived with whole leaves, but was quickly whisked back to the kitchen to chop up the leaves. (We were too lazy to roll up the leaves, but it turned out to be more work the way we'd ordered it - not their fault!).  The other dishes didn't take longer than normal to arrive, either. We ordered the Three-Color Curry with chicken. In my mind, I pictured it the way Mexican or Italian restaurants do it, with the colors separated to represent their country's flags, so I was surprised when all three curries turned out to be mixed together. Nevertheless, it was delicious, and deliciously calorific. We also had the Spicy Eggplant, with beef, and that was piquant and flavorful, and a great contrast to the creamy curry. It wasn't a very large portion, but we were so stuffed thanks to the salad that we didn't care. I also appreciated that we were able to have brown rice at no extra cost, and that was a big serving, too.  I was really happy that we endured the slings and arrows at the beginning of our visit, because Le Thai has so much to recommend it. It's definitely worth the wait, but be sure to take advantage of the advance waitlist.",

If it's outstanding, the restaurant is usually outstanding. If the pad see ew is unimpressive, then I usually won't give the place a second chance. This my friends, was take a cab downtown next time I'm in Las Vegas pad see ew.  We ordered takeout, but I was really feeling the whole decor and vibe of this place, from the bar seating to the covered patio section in the back. I would love to dine in on my next trip.  Their chalkboard special included \"yes, it's vegan!\" and my dish included Chinese broccoli. What more can I say? Oh, they're open until midnight too. What are you waiting for? Go check out Le Thai. You won't be disappointed.",

It was nice to sit and reminisce about the time my brother broke his finger and came down to, what is known as the Emergency Arts. We were actually looking right at the second level window of his room, where he got operated on. lol, ah yes, good food, good memories, good brother.

    "text": "The very first meal of my recent Vegas trip. With many more to come its hard to say any were better than this (and I had some GOOD meals).  We didnt get any appetizers and as I sit here thousands of miles away I'm regretting it. We did each get the special drink for the day which was a \"short\" island iced tea for $6. Its was served in a short glass but there was nothing \"short\" about it. Nice and strong!  I ordered Pad See Ewe and my girlfriend had Pad Thai. Normally Thai places never make anything spicy enough for me. They usually ask for for 1-3 stars or whatever and I always say 4 and its still not that hot. For some reason I had a different feeling about this place and chose a 4 out of 5. It was just perfect for me, hot enough to make my nose run but not too hot to eat. And it was omfg awesome delicious to the point of ruining Thai food for me basically anywhere else. I seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was.   My girlfriends Pad Thai was equally awesome, she said it was the best she has ever had. She got a level 2 for spice and I found it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her. Everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh. I took a couple of bites and agreed.  Halfway through eating (unfortunately) our waiter brought us a small asortment of condiments. House-pickled jalapenos, house-made thai garlic chili sauce, some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha. The jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome. I wished I had both for my entire meal.   The service was a little lacking but I'm sticking with five stars because we raved about this meal for the entire night and I'm legitimately upset the damn place is impossible for me to go to anytime soon. Might have to book another trip just to go to Le Thai again.",

The short rib fried rice is fantastic, the awesome noodles are awesome, the pad thai is amazing, and so are the thai style wings but as good as the food is the service is equally bad.   I dont believe Ive ever once had good service here and its a running joke amongst my friends on the process of placing a carryout order here. Ill diagram it for you so everyone else will know the appropriate steps moving forward.  1) Call Le Thai 2) Get placed on hold and listen to annoying beeping sound in your ear 3) Continue listening to annoying beeping sound 4) Cure the common cold or some other complex formula that would take an innate amount of time 5) Continue listening to annoying holding beep sound 6) Hang Up 7) Call back 8) Before being placed on hold let them know you were just on hold for 15 minutes. 9) Enjoy their great food  I wish this was an isolated incident but this happens every time I call them but hey I just ordered for it the millionth time so you win this round le thai you win this round.",

As soon as we arrived I could tell immediately they seem to be organized. They got people zooming all around but they are each doing jobs.  I was browsing the menu and I just had to see their curry selection. Something catches my eye and it is the 3 color curry. Never heard of mixing red,yellow, and green curry. As I am trying to be a little healthy during my vacation I chose the tofu and brown rice. OMG the food was good. I stuck with a spice level 2 to be cautious. It was perfect spice level for me. I suggest everyone try the 3 color curry at least once. I don't know any other place that does that. Portion size was decent and filled me up for the night. Price was maybe a couple dollars higher because of the location but well worth it.  I give 4 stars for great service and great food! I'll be back anytime I am in the area and need some thai food!  Warning this place gets packed and there can be a wait. While we were eating people started arriving in packs and had to wait to be seated. This place is gaining popularity!",

My boyfriend and I came for dinner before a show so this time we ordered cocktails and the Thaijitos were outstanding.  We ordered the spring rolls for an appetizer and they were delicious they were nice and crispy and had good flavor. I had the 3 color curry with a spice level of 10 and boy did they  deliver.  Not sure if going  to 10 is new since in previous visits they told me they only went to 5. This was the first time I actually got a 10 that packed a punch. My mouth was warm and tingling and my nose was running it was perfect! !! My boyfriend had the Awesome noodles with tofu and was extremely tasty! I can not recommended this place enough and besides being delicious the prices are extremely reasonable.",

    "text": "I could not help but be disappointed after how many good reviews I have read about this place. I came here with my friend on a Wednesday at around 11 AM. We figured my two-hour gap between classes would be good to enjoy a well-paced lunch before I got back to the grind. Wrong.   We were seated rather quickly, and our server brought us two glasses of water almost immediately. He asked us if we already knew what we'd like to order. We did: I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef and a Chicken Satay appetizer, and my friend ordered the Pad Thai Noodles. Five minutes later, we were happily nibbling on our Chicken Satay skewers. No complaints there. What was the issue was what happened afterwards, or well, didn't happen.   Keep in mind, our parking ticket expired at 12:45 PM, and I had to be back on campus by 1:00 PM. As the guests around us came and went, and our main dishes still hadn't appeared, I semi-obsessively checked the time. Our empty appetizer plate stared back at us as if to mock our steadily growing impatience. From when our server took our order sometime around 11:09 AM, we waited until 12:22 PM for our main dishes to come out. We ended up having to rush through our meal, which is a bummer, because the Panang Curry was delicious and well-spiced. I was also looking forward to ordering the Mango with Sticky Rice dessert, but we didn't have time to do so.   I wish I could give this place a higher rating, because the server was quick, friendly and informative, and the food ranged from decent (Chicken Satay) to good (Panang Curry). Unfortunately, it took way too long to come out. In a place where customers pay for parking, I think that is a valid concern. Hopefully this extended wait was a one-time deal.",

The Pad Thai was absolutely disgusting. It lacked flavor and was very dry. The beef had a funny smell so I pushed that to the side. The Thai tea was bland. The Crab Rangoon was really good, no complaints there. My friend order the Thaijito, that lacked flavor as well so she sent it back. The best part of the meal was the fried rice that I had 2 bites of. If I ever decided to go back I would get the rice but for $15 the portion is very small. I wouldn't recommend. The service was good and the waitress was friendly. Otherwise, it wasn't worth the hassle of dealing with downtown and hunting for parking.",

Once we were seated inside, we quickly ordered: phad thai, thai teas, coconut soup and an eggplant shrimp. My absolute favorites were the phad thai and soup-- absolutely delicious! I think the secret to their Phad Thai is the fact that they actually stir fry all the ingredients together and give it a nice char-- vs. the traditional method of cooking the noodles and then putting the cabbage and carrots on top. Whatever they do, it's magic!!",

For starters, our server, Trelysa greeted us immediately with water and let us know the happy hour specials. We ordered the Larb Salad and the Pad See Ewe. Both were bursting with flavor and the portions were just right.   When dining out, I'm a huge advocate of receiving a great service.

I had read here on Yelp that Fridays are a busy night and to expect a wait for a table. No problem... we were Downtown and had other things to entertain ourselves before eating.  I had also seen on Yelp that on Friday they close at 3am.  So I was highly disappointed when we got there at 1:40am that we were the last order.  Looking at the menu I noticed that there was a great difference in price ($11-15) from the pictures of the menu posted here on Yelp. At that moment, our waitress came by to remind us again that it was last call and to order our food NOW!  Feeling rushed, we ordered and appetizer and 2 entrees to-go and waited.  During our wait... there was at least another 15-20 people looking to eat and were told to go to FUKU burger instead.  When we got home.... the side of rice that they had for our entrees was old but the actual food was good.  In my opinion... I've been to other Thai places that gave both good food and service.",

I don't recommend this place for Thai food. The potatoes in the curry dish were hard and uncooked, they were not edible.  With a party of 9 and although the server was polite we were kicked out by a Manager suddenly because the table we were sitting at was promised to another large party which we were not previously informed of. We literally had food in our mouth when we were told we needed to leave. This employee was very rude and short and simply did not care.  Save your money and time and go elsewhere.",

I ended up with the awesome noodles with tofu and no fish sauce. It was sweet, garlicky and spicy. I think it probably is better with the fish sauce in it to give it more balance to the sweet. Definitely a fan of the noodles as it was a hybrid of flavors I like in other noodle dishes. I came with a group of Yelper girls and everything we ordered looked and smelled great. I have had the three color curry in the Dans previous restaurant and it's probably just as great here.   The place is small, but there is also a back patio (with heat lamps). It was a perfect night so we sat out there comfortably.  If you're in the Fremont area and need a bite to eat to sop up the drinks, this is pretty good. I'm going to come back to sample more after bar hopping.",

    "text": "Walking down the street with my phone, I was trying to locate where it was. I had the address, but we just couldn't find it. Then my friend pointed, and said, \"There!\" I don't know if it was because of the night, but we couldn't see a clear sign for Le Thai. I actually expected lighted sign or something. Luckily, they closed late, because we were heading there near midnight.  Tom Kah (Coconut Soup)- 3 1/2-stars- I got the chicken and asked for spicy level-4. You won't taste how hot it is, probably because of the soup, but you'll feel it the next day--if you get my drift. The flavor is citrus, sweet, light, and tart. It's covered with fresh mushrooms--I found the chicken on the bottom with all the hot spices. The dish includes green onion, ginger, and lime leaf (Kaffir?). For the price, the dish is a little light. Thankfully, I had been eating all day--literally, so I didn't need to be stuffed once again. As a note, my friend got the fried rice, which was exploding with flavor, and the rice definitely gives more body. This dish may need some extra heft to average itself out.  Chang Beer- 4-stars- As their main beer of choice, I think, it is actually really good. The beer of Thailand, is a light gold beer, lightly flavored and smooth to drink.  Ambiance- The location is trendy with the hard to see sign. Wood planks line the interior and exterior. You can see interesting businesses outside, as this area seems to be a place for cool, artsy people end up. It has a very open, natural feel to it. In the back is an open-air patio, and with the extremes in temperature, I can imagine it gets random use. The music is very hip, mostly remixes with an indie feel to it. We were both surprised they were playing certain songs in a Thai restaurant. They also used iPhones and iPads for orders, which for me, being from Hawaii was an interesting upgrade.   Service- I was surprised there was no Thai person to be seen anywhere. I kind of need that oomph to get me excited. The service was friendly and helpful. The kitchen is open, so you can also see them preparing your meals.  Conclusion- The location being Downtown has a more laid-back clientele which may not totally appreciate this restaurant. Yet, I've also seen younger people, looking for the deals, and they would definitely enjoy this place. It's a little something to search for, but rather worth it when you find it.",

    "text": "LOCATION: I've walked past Le Thai so many times without ever realizing it. They don't have a sign! I went there specifically looking for it and nearly walked past it.  I frequent Vanguard and its literally directly across the street.  AMBIANCE: Walking in, I immediately noticed the small space has such a pleasant decor that feels very home-y and welcoming. Lots of wood, wicker chairs, and an exposed brick wall--almost like a hipster apartment. I chose to sit at a table but you can opt to sit at the bar as well.   FOOD: The whole food menu fits on the back of the beverage selection menu. Makes sense, small restaurant small menu? But it won't disappoint. The menu is small but mighty. There's a selection of appetizers, soups, stir-frys, & curry. I was dining solo so I didn't get to sample much: Thai Chicken Wings & Chicken Ga Pow (Basil Stir-Fry). Chicken Wings were perfectly fried and quite spicy (in a good way) and the sriracha ranch it was served with was addicting! The Ga Pow had a kick. Wish it had a little more fish sauce but it was definitely some of the best stir-fry I'd ordered at a thai restaurant! Next time, I'm taking on the curry!!! I've heard only good things about it.  DRINKS: Decent size beer & sake selection. I was sick so I went for the House Green Tea.   SERVICE: When I first arrived, I felt like they were too busy to pay attention to me. They were taking a bit too long to take my order and they didn't come around enough to check on me or to refill my water. But as it got a little later and the place started filling up, I felt the servers became more attentive and the service got better. One thing, why you so stingy on napkins? Thai food means runny noses! I need more than one napkin at a time.   I'll be back!!",

    "text": "Considering this is Vegas and that we're in America its very close in taste and smell. But there's a few things which make this Thai restaurant miss the mark for people who know real Thai food.   1. Too sweet. In Thailand. Cooks add sugar to thai food to balance the sour and spice for tourists and it is a sign of a novice chef who is cooking to get a \"yum\" response and forgetting to aim for a \"wow\"  2. No fish sauce. What Thai restaurant doesn't have fish sauce on the table? That would have balanced the sugar.   3. Portions. Massive, too big, we walked out feeling sick and only ate half. The flavour was lost in the kilogram of chicken.   4. The prad kapow chicken normally comes with a fried egg on the rice, not the main.   5. Not spicy, I had to add dried chilli flakes which is not Thai chili. I didn't see Thai chilly except for s solid chilly. And everyone knows you chop and dice s chilly to balance the spice. Having a whole one hidden in your meal is a landmine if you're not used to Thai spicy.   6. I asked for the meal to be cooked as close to thai style as possible both in flavour and spice and it was neither flavourful or spicy.   Conclusion, if you want to get a hint of Thai food and you're starving then its good.   If you want to taste Thai food, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Best Pad Thai I've ever had - and unlike any other version you're used to. No wonder Keri Simon made the chef make it in front of him.   Larb salad was also great, but should come with a disclaimer. After a few bites, its like napalm for your tastebuds and you won't be tasting anything else for the next three hours. So, do not get it along with another entree - you won't be able to tell the two apart. Bottom line: Larb is an either or situation.  The food is outstanding. For this, you will have to put up with sparse, metered parking, very slow service, spotty guest wi-fi that kicks you off every 30 seconds (in case you care about connectivity at this point). One little oddity is that when you walk in, you're immediately surrounded by tables and other dining customers. Close quarters. There is no hostess welcome/wait area. And when you arrive, no one pays you the attention to either seat you or tell you what's up - like where to wait or how long of a wait it will be. You walk in and hope you get a server's attention who may or may not seat you in the next 5-10 minutes.   Do go on a nice sunny day - they have a beautiful, relaxing back patio area where you can enjoy a great meal in a nice, open environment. Inside is a bit cramped... but did I mention that they serve THE BEST PAD THAI EVER!!? ;)   *2-star = freaking SPICY!! Next time... no star, so I can taste more of their amazingness and not be sniffling through my entire meal.",

    "text": "I'm a Noodle Freak. I love noodles and I eat noodles almost every day. Unfortunately working in Downtown doesn't give me much options in terms of food.  I went to Le Thai once and ordered Awesome Flat Noodle with Shrimp. I really had high hopes because of the great reviews and the $15 price.   The portion was so so and the noodles were salty. I wanted to like it, but it was just not good enough and OVERPRICED.  3 weeks later, i had my noodle craving and decided to try Le Thai again. I ordered over the phone for take out. The food was ready when I get there and the server was friendly and sweet.   (So, my rating is solely based on their food.)  I ordered Pad Kee Mow (chicken option, $13) this time. Again, the noodles were so SALTY! I thought my taste buds were too sensitive, so I asked my husband to try the noodles. He thought the noodles were too salty too. The ingredients were nothing to write home about; minced chicken with some veggies. I was so disappointed. If this wasn't a take out, I would have returned it and gave my comment to the chef.   My husband's Lunch Special Green Curry was ok. But I had such bad experience with their noodles that I just won't go back.  Sorry, it's you. Hopefully you can improve your noodle dishes soon.",

The prices are not bad, they have plenty of vegetarian choices and pretty delicious desserts as well, my favorite is the sticky rice with fresh mango. Stay away from the nutella crape though, the scrambled eggs on top of nutella are just not a good idea.  Definitely looking forward to going back.",

We tried the pork jerky appetizer and shared the 3 color chicken curry and the short rib fried rice, both at level 4.  Wow!   These were amazing dishes.   So flavorful and delicious.   Our meal was fantastic and we left feeling very satisfied.    The next day we talked about our meal so much that we decided to go back that evening.  It was much less crowded on Monday.    We tried the waterfall beef appetizer and the spring rolls.  The waterfall beef was delicate and delicious.  For entrees we each had our own short rib fried rice.   I topped mine with a fried egg.   Fantastic once again.   Thank you again Le Thai for helping make our LV mini vacation so enjoyable.",

Although many items on the menu look delicious, I wouldn't know because we both get the short rib fried rice every.single.time. I've tried to replicate it at home, braising expensive short ribs for hours, never coming close to this bowl of perfection. We both order between a 3 on the 1-5 scale, and it never disappoints.    The spring rolls and chicken satay are flavorful, they have a good beer list, but the the fried rice is really the main attraction for me.

The number 3 which is labeled \"hot\", was definitely very spicy and warming.The panang curry was a delicious bowl of sweet, spicy, and fresh ingredients. The waterfall beef was a great appetizer. If you are not into spice, this is a great choice since they only prepare it mild. The beef was tender, and it came served with delicious sticky rice.  The Thaijito cocktail was amazing!

No problem, we went up to the outside window to get a drink and an appetizer while we waited. Our positive experience started with the bartender ushering us to two seats at the bar, so no wait. Things just got better. I asked a passing waitress my favorite question, \"What do people come back here for?\"  She gave us three, 1.  Spare Rib Fried Rice, 2. Three Color Curry and 3.  Pad Kee Mow.  I had the fried rice, my wife the curry snd we were both wowed. Not only was the food great, the staff was so attentive. Even the wait staff not at the bar stopped to see if we needed anything.   They were all so friendly, even as busy as they were and the food was fantastic. Next trip to Vegas, we will be back!!",

We arrive at our seats and maybe another 5-10 minutes pass by and the guys behinds us are seated right next to us.   We ordered before they did and even ordered an appetizer and  they received their food 1st. No big deal. But then I noticed we are being ignored and the people behind us have the waiter coming by every couple of minutes. Like WTF! So I call over the waiter and ask her about our order, she says it will be right out and trys to walk off...I had to raise my voice slightly so she could stay and I brought up that we were here 1st and they got their food already. BOTH OF THEM.  and we havent even got our appetizer...she said \"oh yea, they forgot your ticket\" I wanted to get up and leave at this point. So they bring ALL the food our together and I ordered soup. The soup was clearly not cooked...it litterly tasted like water with flavoring....The strangest taste ever just horrible....And on top of that they brought it in a HUGE bowl with a HUGE spoon...it was obviouse this was a bowl where you take from and pour into a smaller bowl (which they forgot) I looked around and saw someone else who had ordered soup who had the same huge bowl and additional smaller bowls to pour into. I call the waiter over and say, I think this bowl and spoon is a little big for me to eat it directly....and she VERY RUDELY says, Well all you have to do is ask for more bowls...is that what you want? So I rudely responded YES thats exactly what I want....and she walked away...didnt say anything, just walked away. So the bowl comes out and I asked for lemons to try to see if I can make the soup edible....but no luck. So I didn't eat the soup, I took maybe 5 bites from the entire thing...and this thing was BIG. So I decided I was going elsewhere to eat and we ask for the check. The waiter brings us the check and says \"I added a 10% discount\" for the trouble im guessing. And I said, I didn't like the soup and didn't eat it could you take it off the bill because im going to eat elsewhere. She said, \"whats wrong with it?\" After all this history we  had, shes going to ask me whats wrong with it. I lost it!   I basically told her it was bland and not cooked. She said let me talk to my manager...I said please do and if not I would like to speak with him because this whole night is ridiculous. She came back and took the soup off and we left...Hungry.   The atmosphere is nice...I like it",

    "text": "Came in here with a group of friends for a late dinner on a Thursday. There was no wait to get seated even though Downtown Fremont was pretty cracking! Pretty excited to try it out after hearing endless Zappos employees (including Tony) rave about it, so...  Food: Luckily I had browsed through Yelp and I'm a huge fan of short rib so I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice.. BEST DECISION EVER. It was amazing, to say the least. Everyone at my table that tried it said the same. The ratio of rice to short rib to vegetable was on point (get extra veggies!) and there was a good amount of heat in the dish. I also tried the Tri-Color Curry and the Pad Thai but I wasn't as impressed, I've had better in CA. The fried rice was a little pricey (~$15) but well worth it for the first time.  Service: Waitress was prompt with the water so that helped when the food took a while to come out. Only issue: bill can be split only 4 ways so it was a hassle exchanging cash amongst our party and some of us ended up paying more than we should have.   Environment: Too dark! I could barely see what was in my bowl, but the outside patio area would have been awesome during the day. Overall, the bathroom was clean so not too much to gripe about.   Drinks: I was looking forward to trying one of their specialty drinks.. until I saw the prices. Spiked Thai Tea for upwards of $12!? No way, but I guess the 2/5 $ was pretty accurate.   Overall: I would definitely come back... for lunch and with cash. Drink were a bit too pricey for me, but the food was awesome!",

It has become tough for business lunch because so many other professionals there. The curries and the panang are great. Atmosphere is more of a non-professional vibe to be more comfortable.  I go to a lot of business lunches there, but frankly, the close quarters make me always feel like our conversation is being listened to. So social lunches good- business lunches not so much. I met the owner once at the bar with my wife late nite and had a great experience, really good times, but need to up the execution.sorry, this has been one of my stalwarts and needs a bit of a re-dedication, to me at least.",

This restaurant has filled a need for not just a great Thai restaurant downtown but just a great restaurant downtown. There is not one dish I wouldn't recommend.  My favorite's the Thai salad.  Typical lunch crowd consists of table-fuls of Zappos people, talking Downtown projects or lawyers coming up for air from 16.1 discovery.   Night time is a more eclectic assortment of people, unified in their readiness to sample the bar as much as the food.  The staff is always nice even when they're busy.  I can easily eat there everyday. But I'm Asian, so eating Asian isn't out of the norm, it's like eating pizza and hamburgers all the time for Americans.  The only competition with the food is the great ambiance.   A late lunch with a good friend can easily turn into a early start on the weekend with drinks.  Life is good here at Le Thai.",

    "text": "What a delightful and unexpected spot. I don't often get downtown. I need to, but like many locals, I stay on my side of town and hit up a few new places only on occasion. When it comes to Thai food, I stick with the places that know.  I have been disappointed too often in this town, and as a creature of habit, I like to know what I'm getting.  I found Le Thai on the Yelp site when I was looking for a place to meet a friend downtown.  And once again Yelp led me in the right direction.   ATMOSPHERE: Love the space. We first sat outside on an warmish March afternoon and were so impressed with how Le Thai made downtown Las Vegas feel like a hip SoCal location. The well designed outside area is small, but it feels miles away from the bustle of Fremont street. Since that first visit, my friend and I have been back a number of times, and have declared this our meet-up spot. The entire downtown scene has changed so much in the past few years that people who haven't trekked past the Fremont Street Experience are missing out on a number of creative and, more importantly, delicious spots downtown.  We keep saying that we will try a new place downtown business, but we continue to be drawn to Le Thai.  PARKING: Please don't make the mistake I made on my first visit. Don't drive around looking for shelter in a casino's covered parking area. I had to hike to the restaurant from the Cortez's overflow parking. Instead, find the metered parking on 6th Street. It's pricey and your car will be exposed to the elements. But you will be a few steps from your car when you leave the restaurant.  SERVICE: We have never had bad service at Le Thai. Never. The wait staff is warm and helpful. I love that they never rush us. We show up at odd times, so we are not in the middle of their dinner rush. I am sure yo are dealing with a less than enthusiastic crew at those times. But show up at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and you will be treated with courtesy and kindness. I hate asking what I know are silly questions about the menu, but the servers are patient and informative.  Even when there has been a small mistake on an order or a drink has been forgotten, the response is always gracious and apologetic.   FOOD: Delicious. I appreciate the simplicity most of all. I like a light touch to my dishes. All of my favorite foods are simply prepared and properly seasoned. Le Thai hits all the right notes.  The food is flavorful and comforting.   VIBE: Easy SoCal Chic",

Spiked thai ice tea is a must try.",

The portions were good size and would have probably gotten the lunch special next time.   The spice level was legit the last time I went but the second time it didn't seem to really compare.   Sometimes when they see a white person they don't really give you the spice level you want but that is the same with a lot of restaurants even in Thailand.  Wish they had more vegan options but other than that it is a great spot, especially for Vegas.",

The food here is amazing.   This place gets busy and there is usually a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth it. You can reserve your spot in line right through the Yelp app which is super convenient. It will even let you check your position in line and alert you when you should head over and check in. Le Thai isn't huge but they do have a small bar area with seating as well as a few tables outside in front with heat lamps. The people watching on Fremont is fun and will instantly put you in a good mood.   The drunken noodles with ground pork were delicious but the 3 color curry with beef was the best curry I've ever had. They combine the yellow, green, and red curry and the flavor is off the chain. The spice scale ranges from 1-5 with 2 being the default. We stuck with a 2 and it was the perfect blend of spice and flavor. My fiancee and I shared but I totally ate most of his curry. Poor guy didn't stand a chance. Portions were large and the prices were reasonable especially for Fremont Street. This will definitely be a return spot the next time we're in Vegas.   Check in on Yelp and get a bogo Thai tea or coffee!",

Its truly great to have folks who can walk you through every item with authority.  We were booked in on the patio (it's closed in and covered) and the ambiance was eclectic and comfortable.   You could make a meal out of the starters but you'd miss some of the superb entrees. I had the fried rice with chicken and spiced to a 3.   That was great but you know I love the heat. I stuck with the level but handily they brought the spice around in case I'd wanted to customize a bit. I'll do that next time for sure. If you can get to the Fremont street side of town check this place out.   Oh and come early if you wanna make sure to get a seat or hang out to wait for one!",

The pork belly was nice and crispy, with just the right amount of fatty goodness.  The jerky and sticky rice were also good.  The fried rice was good so we ordered a second serving.  The mango coconut rice was also very delicious.  The only disappointment for us was the pad Thai.  I'm not sure if it was a different type of rice noodle but the texture was not what we were expecting.   All in all, we would recommend stopping in if you are in the area.

My only comment would be the spice...if you really like spice, they go on the weak side, which is normal I guess...better than blowing people's heads off. Get at least a 4 if you like to get spicy. (In real life, I don't even like a real Thai spicy, but here I can go 5 no problem.)  Anyhow, all in all, the best Thai I've tried as a resident of L. Vegas",

I do not understand the hype about the food.  I'm not too picky about my Thai food but I definitely felt like the food was extremely americanized(a little bit is okay with me).  This seems more like a trendy hipster experience for those that don't really have Thai food often.  If you're actually looking for decent Thai food, this isn't for you.  I mean if you have any sort of standard for Thai food, this isn't for you.  It was edible but it's quite off and not even close to authentic?  My party ordered very simple dishes including: pad thai, fried rice(two of the most important dishes in Thailand).  I think if you have a palette for extremely salty food and large proportions, then you will like this place(nothing wrong with this).  For what it's worth I cannot claim to be an expert on Thai cuisine.  But based on getting Thai at least once a month wherever I am and having been to Thailand on multiple occasions, this ranks lowest(bottom 5%) on my list in terms of food quality.",

The assistant manager, Dino, worked with me in advance via email to set everything up. I did have a bit of panic in advance because he wasn't as quick to respond to email as I would have expected, but everything worked out in the end and it was a great experience. My guests all LOVED the food, and the restaurant buy-out included wine, beer and a couple of pitchers of sangria, all of which was great for us. Dino and the servers were all really wonderful, and made the entire occasion totally seamless. I was nervous that the outdoor space might have been a bit cold in February but no way, it was covered from drizzle and had plenty of heaters to keep us cozy. Best wedding ever!",

I was ready for some hugging :)  Maybe a hug would've given you a higher rating than 2 stars from me jk.  Really the hug was nothing related to the rating. It was just all not so good to give them anything higher. Waited a long time to get seated. Understandable, a busy place on a Friday night. The girl up in front was friendly. She did at least get the name right when our table was ready.  After being seated, one of the servers took our drink orders and gave us some menus to look at, so far it was running smoothly. An then the heat kicked it. They have these big misters to keep it cool while dining however it was mostly off while we were there. A few minutes at the start and basically the end. It was hot and sweaty. They filled our glasses with water once in while but not to often. Most of the service was slow.  Food wise, at least the stuff we ordered, was aight. The papaya salad was too salty for me, it must've have been the first time I tried it so maybe it supposed to be  that way!? Anyways one taste of it and was like you guys can have the rest I'm good. The pork jerky was ok nothing special. The 3 color curry beef was decent I love curry in general and this one wasn't that bad. The thai style fried rice with shrimp wasn't that bad also. Kind of picked at most of the shrimp though. And then there was the drunken noodles. Honestly i don't even remember it. All the food we ordered was served family style and mostly with some rice. It filled 4 people up.  I also tried the thaijito it was 10 bucks for a small cup. It was strong which was good but because it was hot and at the time I was thirsty with a empty cup of water I gulped that sucker down and that was it. Taste refreshing while it lasted.  Festive decorated and loud. A nice number of seating and a bar area. Would I be back? Maybe if friends wanna go but other then that probably not. Hugs.",

    "text": "This spot is lauded as one of Vegas' best Thai restaurants, really? My experience was average, bordering on dismal. The menu mostly consists of classic dishes, priced on par with other Fremont St businesses. Unfortunately, the flavors aren't there.   TRI COLOR CURRY: Tasted like a panang with extra veggies thrown in. Chicken in the dish was minimal. Curry was very creamy, but ordering a 3/5 was considerably more mild than expected. I do appreciate that brown rice is available without a surcharge. Portion was ample for lunch.  PAPAYA SALAD: $10 for a salad without any protein or flavor. Lots of shredded papaya, but the clearly-frozen-from-a-bag green beans were a complete turn off. The dressing lacked the acidity and pop to make it add anything other than moisture to the salad itself.   I did not experience the service issues that others mention, but didn't see our server much to begin with. I was a little put off by their lack of a public bathroom?*- guess it's lucky I didn't get my curry as hot as I'd wanted, which would have made my guzzle down more water.   Props for having bottles of San Miguel available, and the various outdoor seating areas with misters are a nice touch. But I've had better Thai from takeout spots that are half the price.  *EDIT: I've been corrected that there is indeed a bathroom here, apparently it's outside? Perhaps the exterior signage should say \"bathrooms for customers only\" for clarity, as the sign was my only cue given that my server was only around for the ordering and check and we dined inside where no possible bathroom door existed.",

It was my first time actually stepping away from the tempting buffets of Vegas and finding a sit down spot that actually made real pad Thai and sticky rice with beef.  Le Thai for me is what you would call Authentic for coming to Vegas. Since it's not a chain and almost a hole in the wall type restaurant. It is very small but also has a nice back side that is nicely shaded and ventilated. The customer service was great and I couldn't have expected any more than what they did.  We ordered family style starting from appetizers of cream cheese wontons to sticky rice and beef with an amazing spicy sauce. Tom Yum Soup yo share, pad Thai as well as throwing in some papaya salad (which had a perfect spice). Everything here was flavorful and perfect chafe to your pallet if you're tired of eating Vegas Strip food! Definitely felt fresh and rejuvenated after eating here for lunch! I would definitely recommend coming here if you guys have time to change up the scene, especially being in Vegas!",

Wonderful Thai food at affordable prices, just past the neon lights on Fremont Street. Use Yelp to put your name down on the waitlist.

Who when she finally arrived told me they were closed before I could even tell her I had arrived for my phone order. For a restaurant that was \"closed\" they had a full house still being served out of the kitchen. Let me reiterate it was 9:17 and they close at 10pm. After being directed the bar I was rung up. While waiting for the only polite employ to return with my silverware, another employee gave us the beverage we had ordered and again dismissed us. Upon returning home I was further displeased to find all of it was cold. The phad Thai noodles were congealed and flavorless. The papaya salad had non of the flavors described on the menu.

    "text": "The food here is delicious!! This review is based on a take out order, so I can't really comment on the restaurant itself and the service. But my take out experience was fantastic!  I was around the corner at Downtown Cocktail Room having some drinks. It was getting late and I was starving. My girlfriend is a local and actually works downtown not too far from here. She suggested this spot and said that everything she had here has been delicious. So I was the jerk that called at 10:40 pm for a take out order (when they close at 11pm... I know, I know, I'm an a-hole). But they were more than accommodating. Took my order like it was the middle of the day, without hesitation. So we paid our tab at the bar and walked on over to Le Thai to pick up our food. Walked right up to the take out window and it was ready. We were outta there in like 5 minutes, if that. Headed back to the hotel and did not stop stuffing my face.   I ordered the short rib fried rice and my friend (vegetarian) ordered the tofu pad thai. Between furious bites of amazingness... we kept raving about how good each of our dishes was. My short rib fried rice was so so so damn good. Lots of tender, flavorful pieces of meat and a hint of spice (I got spice level 2). Actually I'm lying - it was more than a hint of spice. I can usually handle spice... but I kept having to blow my runny nose!! It didn't bother me one bit b/c it was just so ridiculously good, and the spice was not too much at all. I'm just sad that I didn't go back to get take out again before my weekend in Vegas was over. When I am back in town, I will MOST DEFINITELY come back here.",

    "text": "I heard rave reviews about Le Thai and decided to give it a try on a random Friday night. I am admittedly picky about Thai food, so I never get my hopes up. Since this is a new \"it\" place downtown there was an hour wait, even at 8:30 on a Friday. So we settled in outside and took advantage of the fantastic people watching. When we first put our names on the list there was a table for 2 open but they immediately put a \"reserved\" sign on it. Wouldn't you know that nobody showed up for an hour so we ended up with that table, mildly irritating!   Once we were seated we were immediately brought water. I love me some water so I was really nervous with the tiny glasses they use, but they also bring a carafe so you can refill often. We also got a Thai tea and were pleased with the really large portion. We put in our order for the Thai style wings right away. The wings were fantastic! They were incredibly crispy on the outside and came with a spicy Siracha ranch sauce. I always go for Pad Thai with beef and this was no exception. The Pad Thai was good, but it was very different. It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don't know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting.   The wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read. In my opinion, this is a trendy downtown restaurant so be ready to wait and dine in a noisy hipster environment.",

I love the atmosphere here and I certainly enjoy sitting at the bar to drink and dine. I ended up here with a friend after happy hour at Vanguard. I told her about the wonderful Lady Boy cocktail and that she had to try it. We ended up both having two while we dined! It is just an amazingly good drink.  This go round I had the Pad Thai at a spicy level of 3. It was a generous portion served in a lovely clean, white bowl. Of course, I gobbled it down quickly, although slowing towards the end because my mouth was afire! But seriously, it was good pad thai. I have come to a conclusion that they do not snub spiciness here. If you are a spicy fan than you gotta eat here.",

Even though your pork pad prik, drunken noodles and pad thai are awesome, I feel the need to try every single dish on your menu. Today I went for the Thai style beef salad, which I very much enjoyed, especially since it is low cal and you only use oil to cook the beef (dressing primarily fish sauce I'm told). My problem is that most of your dishes are a good value, but this one was $8 and not very big. My advice to you is make it bigger or charge less.   One more bit of feedback - get some real iced tea. EVERY single time I'm there, I'm either with someone who wants iced tea or I hear someone try to order iced tea. All you offer is a sugary raspberry tea, which really isn't what you want to drink when you are eating spicy food.   Thanks for coming downtown. You've made lunchtime so much better.",

We had the chicken pad Thai and chicken red curry. We both really loved the meal. Decency was all that was preventing is from licking the bowls. The chicken was lean breast meat and the quality was obvious. The price was around $26 for both items. Dishes can be customized for spice level 1-5. 3 is considered hot so we went with 1.5. My sister loves spice but she found this level to be just right. It added lots without taking away or being unpleasant. The restaurant isn't fancy, it's funky and fun though. Service was bang on.

We immediately placed our order, as we are regulars there and we were starving, the server, an older hispanic woman took our order. We recieved our 2 beers promtly. 20 minutes later she came back to check on us, we asked about our food, she said it was coming.   45 minutes later we asked about our food again, our server never placed our order, then she frantically tried to put it in without aknowloging what happened.  The people that were seated after us were eating their meal. There were only 3 tables total, including us, so they were not super busy. I don't understand it.  We were starving, we tried to leave but she acted offended that we wanted to leave. Took forever with the bill. we had to look at a menu so we could calculate how much it would be, so we could leave cash and get out of there. She handed it to us as we were walking out, there was already cash on the table.  She never apologized, never brought our food, oh but she did charge us for the beers. I think the owners of this place are great and the food is awesome, but the staff needs quite a bit of work. When they're not there to supervise, service sucks.  If she would have apologized, comped our beers or simply brought us a free appetizer we would have been satisfied. Instead, I'm still upset and writting this review. We went to Mob Bar, our food was served in less than 10 minutes.",

The atmosphere here is laid back cool and the people here are welcoming.    This place also has the second best Phad Thai I've ever had.  To be honest with you,  I had a bowl of it early Thursday afternoon and I almost went back to get more for dinner but I resisted...until lunch the next day.  I seriously couldn't get it off my mind.  The food here is great.  $13 will get you a plenty big portion that has that unique mix of flavors I want in Phad Thai.  I ordered the spice level 4 but Ashley the bartender recommended 2 (\"mild\") out of 5 with some extra chilies on the side.  Long story short, the next day I easily handled the level 4 (\"spicy\") and the next time I'm going all the way to 5 (\"Thai spicy\"),  I know most people going to downtown Las Vegas usually stay under the protective canopy of The Fremont Street Experience, which is a blast.  But for those adventurous souls that like to step out of the box and explore - you owe it to yourself to stop here and get yourself a bowl of Phad Thai.  Tip:  This place is BUSY so be prepared to be on a wait at lunch and dinner times.",

Everything I have tried is very good, however what I always crave and have to order is the Tom Kha soup which is awesome! You know from the moment it arrives your in for a treat as the smell wafting up from the bowl is amazing, it tickles the senses!  Then you dive in and experience an explosion of different flavors.  In each spoonful you get a exotic mixture of coconut, fresh mushrooms lemon, cilantro, spring onions,ginger, and Thai spice. Also if you ask they will gladly add rice noodles to the soup which I definitely recommend.   The place is not large and so on the weekend there is usually a little wait.  However during the week have never had any wait.  Also they have a take out window were you can order to go. They also have a small patio with 5 were you can sit outside and watch the flow on Fremont street which is always interesting! In addition the service each time I have visited has been very good and always friendly.    My only word of advice when you order they ask how spicy you want it.  They offer from 0 (no spice) to 5 (Thai spice), with 3 listed as hot. Well this rating scale is accurate!  I have found most places embellish so if 3 says hot, well it is usually not really that hot.   Howeveri I have ordered a 3  at La Thai and it was definitely hot!",

Have had better cab Rangoon elsewhere BUT the entree was what it should all be about and for the price I'd say Le Thai is a no brainer easy choice for a delicious meal.",

They do have a higher level of spiciness. So if you order a 3, I'm sure your mouth will be watering. I made a mistake and ordered a 6 on my Thai Beef salad & boy did I need extra water. I'm a big Thai beef salad fan &  I don't think they have the very good Thai beef salad. It needs a little less carrots and little more lettuce.  They, however, have one of the best Pad Thai in town! Order it as a level 1 & it's perfect! The noodles are cooked very well & not overly cooked where it's soggy and squishy.   The location is smack dap on Fremont street next to all the popular bars so it does get pretty busy at night & the wait is pretty intense especially when you are drunk! Sometimes you can tip the guy in the front so he can let you in right away.. Lol! But you didn't hear that from me!",

There is usually a line if you come during lunch and dinner times because the restaurant is small and is pretty well known. They offer pretty genuine Thai Food with superb service. Every time I have been here the waitresses have been amazing. I usually sit outside in the back patio. They have heaters and the patio is enclosed so do not worry about getting too cold.  Recommendations:  1.) Waterfall Beef (Appetizer)- This tender beef is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. The beef is perfectly cooked: tender, juicy and clean. My favorite part of the dish in the sauce it comes with. I do not know how they make the sauce but Im guessing its a mixture of vinegar, fish sauce and heaven! haha. I wanted to pour it on everything!  2.) Thom Kha Kai (Soup)- This lemon grass coconut soup is a must try! I can't quite find the words to explain the taste but if you like sweet, tangy with a bit of spice, it'll be the perfect dish for you.  3.) Padt Thai (Noodles)- These rice noodles with stir-fried egg, green onion, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, and cilantro left me craving for more!  4.) Drinks- Thai Tea or Singha (signature Thai beer) *The owner's son is pretty cool too ;P*",

I was excited to eat here after getting a couple recommendations and seeing the good reviews.  Ambiance: I loved the interior and decor.  It's not tacky American Asian restaurant. It has a nice authentic vibe to it.  It's also well-located in the middle of downtown, half a block from the Fremont Street Experience.  Perfect if you don't want to drive and you're staying downtown.  I ordered the Awesome Noodles with spicy level 3.  They were good, but not amazing. The spice level was perfect.  If you like the upper level of Medium, then 3 is the way to go.  However, the food was not worth $14! That's pretty expensive for downtown Las Vegas (it's not the Strip, remember).  For that price level, you can expect knock-your-socks-off great Thai in San Francisco, DC, or NYC.    I ordered a Thai iced tea as well, which was fine.  All in all, my tab came to $22.  That's insane for one entree and one non-alcoholic drink at 3 pm on a Thursday.",

Holy smokes was it pretty tasty but it did smack me in the mouth a bit with the spiciness given my lack of experience with this type of food.  Day two I had the pad kee mao with chicken.  This time I backed the spiciness back down to 2 out of 5 and that was more to my liking.  This place is pretty deceiving when you look in.

Most of us thought the food was good, HOWEVER, the service was really crappy. They didn't have enough waiters, thus they were careless, i.e. not bringing out everyone's silverware at the same time, forgetting orders, etc. We decided not to come back.   Since we work downtown, there are only so many places to go, so recently a friend and I decided to give it anoooother chance and WHOA were we surprised! First of all the portions are larger than before, and the food is better than before. We've tried the wings, the jerky and all of the curries and everything was fantastic! Plus the have some accesible wine, beer and cocktail options.   The most important thing though, and the reason I wil keep coming back is the service. I believe their management became aware of the quality of the service offered and remedied the situation. On all of my last visits I was greeted cheerfully, and was waited on promptly and friendly throughout the meal.",

I was in Vegas for a long weekend recently with a buddy of mine and we wanted to venture off of the tourist area and find something local.  We didnt have to venture far.  We literally stumbled across Le Thai and we were not disappointed.  I can honestly say that the meal I had at Le Thai ranks in the top three meals I ever ate.  In fact, I am hoping for a cheap flight back to Las Vegas....not for the gambling and drinking but to make it back to Le Thai.  I will always recommend this place to everyone I know that will be visiting Las Vegas.  A must go if you live in town or are visiting.",

We ordered the Thai Beef and Meatball soup, well we tasted more spice than anything else and we had ordered mild because of the comments we read about the spice level of this place. Soup was a very spicy bland broth with no particular flavor other than hot.  The Pad Thai was a disappoint; we definitely had better elsewhere.  As far as atmosphere, would you believe they turned off the misters in the patio at the height of service Saturday night.  What were they thinking?!  It became miserably hot, especially since the humidity has been elevated the past few days.  This is not a place I would recommend.",

In the vein of the Griffin, Beauty Bar and other cool revived downtown spots - Le Thai offers a really cool atmosphere with outdoor seating that feels very much like what I imagine being in Thailand would feel like!  If only they had a waterway nearby, lol.  We ordered the Tom Kha soup with chicken, Chicken Pad Thai and Pork panang  .  The soup was YUMMY!  And I eat A LOT of Thai food.  It was flavorful with big chunks of tender chicken, mushrooms and scallions.  Use the green chili chunk sauce to give it a tasty, tangy punch!  The Pad Thai was the most extraordinary.  It had a very cool grilled taste to the noodles??? Never had a Pad Thai quite like it.  Was weirdly delicious!  The Pork panang was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  NOTE:  Their stuff is SPICY!  Order a 1 or a 2 if you aren't sure about spice levels.  Looking to go again this coming weekend and trying the meatball soup!  Can't wait.  (p.s. they take order on ipods, lol it's fun, quirky and cool)  Also any number of servers will come to your table and make sure you are doing well.  Price wise we also ordered BIG Singha beer and steamed rice and for all it came to about $45.  Not bad at all.  p.p.s. The menu is the little placard on the table when you sit down, lol.",

Start with the pork jerky - it is paired up with some rice and an excellent sauce. I have enjoyed every dish on the menu, but I will always favor the curry. The spicy eggplant is also dynamite. The decor is simple, but pleasant, with a small indoor room and a large outdoor area in the back. My only knocks are the service (commonplace for Asian restaurants) and the absence of wine glasses. Still, neither of those digs are enough to warrant anything other than the full five stars.",

    "text": "Had an interesting experience here. Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that?  Things got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well.   Overall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown.",

We asked the hostess what was the point of making a reservation, if we had to wait an additional 45 minutes on top of our reserved time. We were told, \"That's just the way it is here.\" I live in New York City, and have never been so offended at a restaurant. Is the food here really that good?

We put our name on the list and was told they would send a text message when our table was ready. I am sooooo glad we opted to wait instead of bailing and going somewhere else. I had the Short Rib Fried Rice and it was amazingly good. I ordered it #2 hot and probably should have ordered a #3 (was very flavorful just not quite hot enough - my fault).  I've honestly been craving a second helping all day today. My buddy ordered Waterfall Beef Noodles which was equally as delicious. We didn't have drinks, only water last night.  Our total bill came out to $26!!  You won't find that on the strip. My advice: if you live in vegas or visiting sometime soon, do not pass go and do not collect $200!

The beer was good, the spring rolls were good, and Pad Kee Mow was solid and they did a very good job making it hot.  I am rarely satisfied with heat level and this actually didn't need any additions.  Would definitely go again.",

We started our meal off with Chicken satay /w cucumber and peanut butter dressing. It was very tasty and the peanut butter was just right!  We then had the massaman curry chicken with brown rice and I had the strip rib with rice. Yummy yummy!   Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu and was able to give advice on what we should try.  Would definitely recommend as a place to try on your trip to downtown Vegas!!!",

The patio is right below or next to an extremely loud club whose music was so loud that it vibrated throughout the space and was pretty intrusive, so just be aware to ask for indoor seating if you're looking for a more quiet meal.   Our server Jordan was incredibly friendly and helpful!   As for the food, it was solid, but I wouldn't come out of your way for it. We ordered the pad kee mao and and a cucumber red onion salad, for dessert we split a fried banana spring roll thing. They have garnishes and spices at each table so you can adjust your spice level accordingly, which I really appreciated. Decent meal, we left full, but nothing stood out.",

That just screams \"GOOD FOOD HERE!\" Luckily, the bar was wide open so we sat ourselves down and went to town on some good drinks and food!  The bartender/server was AWESOME! She knew her drinks AND knew all the Thai terminology! Ordering was such a breeze with her!  The nitty gritty:  - My Thai: This was so good!! You definitely have to try this, they do a lot of yum Thai twists on classic drinks!  - Tamarind Margarita: Yo.. this drink was fire too!! I would have never thought to add tamarind to a margarita but this worked out SO WELL!!!  - Spicy Basil Chicken (5 spicy) with Sticky Rice: OMG this had so much flavor!! One of the best I've ever had! It wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be, but they're more than happy to bring you Thai chilies in fish sauce. And the portion was so big! I ate less than 1/4 with my side of sticky rice and was stuffed!  - Spicy Shrimp Fried Rice: I'm not a fan of raw veggies in my fries rice and this had so much cucumber/tomato mixture in it! The flavor of the rice was good but I'd probs have to order it without all that extra ish in it. Blehhhh  - Garlic Fried Rice: The guy in our group eats fries rice like me. Plain, with no veggies LOLOLL. I didn't try this, but it smelled SO DELICIOUS when she set it on the table. I seriously just wanted to go to his plate and lick some off!  I would defs come back again after a ratchet night on the strip! Or maybe you should get ratchet with me and we can go together! Boomshakalakaaaa",

We definitely wanted to try this place the next time we returned and here we were! We came by around 8PM and even with the Rock and Roll Marathon going on, this place seemed empty but the wait was 30 minutes! It was no big deal, we were planning to walk and hang around Fremont for a while so we did until we received the text to return for our table.  The place is cozy, nice, and the outdoor patio in the back has heaters and is covered to keep us warm.   We ordered two noodles - the Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles) with shrimp, and the Pad Thai with beef, as well as the spiked Thai tea.   These were some damn fine noodles! You can truly taste the authenticity as if we stepped into grandma's home!  Both noodles were cooked perfect to al dente, and juicy but not so crazy with sauce. The pad thai had very great flavor, beef was so tender and flavorful, and all the veggies were crisp. The drunken noodles were tasty, shrimp was cooked perfectly, and there was a very nice spice to it but not overpowering at all!  The spiked Thai tea was actually not quite to my liking, I LOVE Thai tea and figured Vegas would be the best spot to try it spiked. But the whiskey I believe they used was just too strong and didn't go well with the Thai tea in my opinion.  Overall, solid 4/5 stars, tasty filling food, and we left very happy!",

I used to feel that way about Egg McMuffins in my drunken days...   I knew something was off when I ordered and they asked how spicy on a scale of 1-4. My maiden voyage to this establishments, I was with a girlfriend from down home in the Bayou. She ordered hers a 4 and they guy said, \"Wow, that's really spicy!\" She responded, \"we're from Louisiana, we can handle the heat.\" They guy swayed us, we ordered 3s and it was child's play. We had tickets to a show, so when re-offered to make our food, we declined. The curry's we ordered tasted exactly the same. Panang should not taste like the yellow curry. It was sweet coconut with a medium spice level. The dish just fell flat. My second visit I got the Tom Kha soup! Very good, huge portion. Definitely one of the better versions I've tasted, but not really hitting the Tom Kha spot. Soup shouldn't be your best dish, especially in a Thai joint.   Service was okay. Nothing too stellar. Actually, nothing about Le Thai is too memorable. How is this place hailed as a one of the best in Vegas?!   This place should be renamed Le Sigh.",

    "text": "My sister and I were staying at the Golden Nugget (lucky us) and were looking for a local restaurant for dinner. To our surprise, we found Le Thai tucked away in the middle of Fremont St. We walked in and were seated right away, even though the tiny place was packed. We sat at a counter in the patio section behind the restaurant. It was a cool night, but with heating lamps and a warm bowl of deliciousness, it was quite comfortable.  We each ordered a Thai iced tea and a bowl of noodles. The iced tea was comparable to any Thai iced tea I've ever had, nothing amazing, but good. I ordered the awesome noodles with chicken (mostly because of the name) and was very pleased. It was flavorful and filling. My sister got the pad thai which was also very good. We ended up sharing our dishes since they were both so good. Overall, I think I liked the pad thai best, but I'm always a sucker for pad thai anyway.  The pricing is a little high for the portions, but not bad. The meal was much better than any of the cheaper options on Fremont Street. And it's Vegas anyway. Earlier in the day we paid twenty bucks for a drink, so fifteen bucks for a bowl of noodles really isn't  bad. The service was OK, but was a little bit slow. It took a while for our orders to be taken and to get our drinks.   Overall, this is a nice spot. I'd highly recommend it to anyone stuck in Old Vegas, looking for some quality food.",

Totally my fault for not going with what I originally wanted.  Upon noticing my less than enthusiastic mood over my dish, they immediately asked if I would like a round noodle dish or even our money back.  We declined of course because it was no fault of theirs, but I thought them going the extra mile was pretty awesome.  We will be back and next time we'll wait for a table out on the patio.",

It's a little pricey at $14, but it's a really good serving size. I'm pretty petite and get full after eating half, so it makes for amazing leftovers for the next meal! Only con would be how busy it gets, and how difficult parking in the Fremont area can be. I haven't actually dined in, in a while because of how long the wait usually is. At this point I almost always call for pickup and just enjoy it at home or at work.",

    "text": "The main thing is it's cool to have a local place to eat downtown that's not in a casino.  Other than that, it's overpriced ($12-15 for traditional Thai entrees), and the food is solid, but not special.  I like what they did with the back patio - the good things about sitting outside without the ugly view of nearby buildings and air conditioners. The front patio is kinda lame since they just put tables outside, literally right on Fremont.  My main complaint is the seating. We weeee originally seated at a bar top, only it doesn't look at a bar, it looks at a wall. Plus the dishwasher or something is on the other side, so the bar shakes like crazy. Constantly. Luckily, they honored our request to move to a table because it seems pretty annoying to have to eat there! Probably won't be back...too many other options!",

    "text": "Yes Indeed I am a Fan of Le Thai.   I find myself finding ways to be near Le Thai on East Fremont Downtown, just in case I get hungry.. I love this little Thai spot. It's definitely a more fused-up style of Thai cooking, hence the 'Le' :] but I love everything about it. I have never dined anywhere other than on the back patio under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat, it is really comfortable back there.   With all the items you would expect from a Thai menus - like Pad Thai and Panag Curry, Le Thai also incorporates some other delicious flavors.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp. It's. Really. Delicious.   The only thing that I find is difficult for me to grasp is they're spicy seasonings. I can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my Asian-Style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at Le Thai. I usually get a '4' out '5' when they ask for a preference in spice level.. Sometimes it's perfect, and sometimes it's not spicy at all, and then other times I can't even eat it it's so hot.    I have been told that they use 'Ghost Pepper' (look it up..its a really HOT pepper,) on the hotter end of the scale. This may be why it's sometimes hard to handle. The remedy for me, has been to order a level 3 and spice it up with the peppers and chili sauce they bring to the table. Then it's perfect for me every time.   If you haven't tried it, and love Thai Food.. I think you will be very happy with Le Thai. Everything is fresh and the staff is great and the prices are right. See you there!",

    "text": "Le Thai is more downtown than Thai.  I have to applaud any business that makes a go at surviving in Downtown Las Vegas. The pressure to serve, provide quality food and live up to the facade that is Downtown Hip is a hard existence. Le Thai seems to manage all of these at the expense of an interesting and unique menu.  There was nothing wrong with the food but there was nothing great about the food. Fried rice was fried rice -step down from the Basil fried rice that had Thai fans doing backflips on West Sahara. The curry was delicious. All curry is delicious. Le Thai however did not blow my curry filled brain. The Pad Thai was standard. Chefs should be challenged.   So then we come to the atmosphere. Le Thai is divided into three sections. There are some patio tables out front, a really crammed indoor section in the center and some sort of a quasi outdoor/sunroom in the back. It reminds me of some of the ruined houses in Huntridge or John S. Park where the low income residents would convert the space between the house and the back wall into a room with a tarp for a roof so grandpa has a place to stay. Le Thai has a golden opportunity to utilize the space but fall flat with tarp roof, cheap trellis,hanging plug-in heaters and good ol' fashioned PTA style tables and chairs. Maybe some sprucing up of the back area will have an effect on how customers enjoy the menu.   The service was fine, food was delivered in good time and we never felt neglected nor pestered.  If you are searching for terrific, transcendent Thai food, Le Thai can only deliver the charm that is a downtown trying real hard not to be skanky.",

We had a party of 4 and we were welcomed at our table by a very good waitress with a bowl of spicy and sweet peanuts that held us over as we reviewed the menu.    We sat on the back patio under some beautiful murals and attractive lighting.  The music was very cool and had a nice reggae vibe.    We ordered crab rangoon to start which were wonderful and had some drinks as well.  For entrees we had pad thai with chicken, eggplant with shrimp, and yellow curry with tofu.  Each of these plates was really tasty and was a perfect amount of food for four.  We sat down at about 5:15pm on a Friday and the tables were already filling up.  Get there early to enjoy this gem located in the up and coming East Fremont District.",

And there were at least four servers I counted. There may have been parties at seven or eight tables max.

    "text": "On a recent trip to downtown Las Vegas, four of us had an OK meal at Le Thai.  When we put our name on the wait list, we noticed that their host (Asian female) was extremely inefficient and rude.  She told us that it would be at least 45 minutes wait, but we were seated after about 10minutes.   The food and service were good but the food was more expensive or at par with other famous Las Vegas Thai restaurants.  Few days later we visited Le Thai again and were pleased to find another host (Hispanic female).  This person told us the wait would be at least one hour.  We returned after a long stroll, and this person told us to be seated inside the heated area right in front of the take out window.  We waited another 30 minutes. Then the host told us that it is our turn, but the only seating they have is bar seating facing a back wall, as they have a reservation for 12!  As we walked out we found at least four unoccupied tables with seating for four people.  She never even apologized for the inconvenience she caused.  Why did she bother to even put our name on the wait list?  I am sure that she thought that we will never return.  I have a message for this establishment.  You might be able to charge top dollar for a mediocre meal to tourists who have no other options for Thai food in downtown Las Vegas.  But, you survive also because of the locals.  If you keep employing idiots, and these idiots are rude and unfriendly, your customers will choose other Thai restaurants such as Lotus of Siam Garden and Hong Kong Garden especially when they have the ability to get on their car drive a few miles!   I sincerely hope that you fire these idiots and employ an experienced host who is friendly to your customers.",

We were seated quickly and was again quickly accommodated when we added three more people to our table.  Understandably it was a monday night but there is no recession here.  Our server took our order on her iPhone which was way cool.  Unfortunately, one would think that this would prevent mistakes and/or lost orders but not so much.  We ordered the awesome noodles with chicken.  I wish I took a picture.  We tried to order another as there were 6 of us now but after two attempts it just never came.  We ordered other dishes which were good but the awesome noodles stands out so much it's hard to talk about anything else.  The flat rice noodles were incredibly fresh and the flavor has the perfect amount of slightly sweet soy sauce and spice.  Just a note that their spice level is on the high side.  I ordered it mild and asked for the dry spices on the side for extra flavor.  venue - 4 food - 3.5 service - 2 prices - 3",

    "text": "The food is decent (even good) but the customer service is so bad that I just can't come back.  I want to like this place.  I really do.  But I came for my last time in a few weeks back and the manager (?) or owner (?) went up to my friend and acted horrendously.    Some background: As a group (a month or so ago) we called ahead and asked  for a reservation since it was our friend's birthday and we wanted to do Thai for lunch.  We were told over the phone by one employee that they don't do reservations, but we could order ahead and they would make sure a table was held open for us (not sure why that isn't a \"reservation\").   When we arrived at the restaurant, we walked in and the place was full except for one table with a \"reserved\" sign sitting on it.  We assumed it was ours.  But when we tried to claim it, we were told we couldn't sit there and they didn't have a table saved for us.  The woman we spoke with was abrupt and rude.  When we explained that we called ahead and were told that a table would be waiting for us, she sharply told us that no one would have said that because they don't take reservations.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I went in with my friend for dinner.  Just after we sat down, I left to use the restroom and when I came back, I found we'd been asked to leave.  Apparently a woman working there (the manager? or owner?) came over to my friend and asked if she was the same person who had problems during the birthday lunch.  My friend said that she was one of the people that was there for the birthday lunch (expecting an apology).  The female employee showed my friend a receipt for the food we didn't eat and explained how much money the store had lost because of her.  My friend asked if the woman wanted us to pay for the meal we didn't eat and the woman replied that she just wanted my friend to know what she had cost the restaurant.  Wow.  This person runs a restaurant and thinks this is acceptable.    I mean, I'd love to come back for the Awesome Noodles, but I can't support someone who is so passive-aggressive and thinks its okay to treat a customer like that.",

What we ordered:  - Spring Rolls - Light and crispy. The sweet chili sauce was the perfect accompaniment  - Tom Ka Soup with Tofu - By far the best Tom Ka I've had. The coconut was a nice cooling factor against the heat of the spice and the freshness of the lemongrass. Perfection!  - Awesome Noodles - Perfect name for the perfect noodle dish. I ordered it with chicken and with an over medium egg on top. This is a must try!  - Fried Bananas - Pretty standard. It was good, but I don't think you could really mess this up. It was light and crispy. Only thing I would've changed is if it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   Le Thai is a must try!",

You'll hit craziness, but if you show up later, you'll have the place to yourself and may actually get that check-in hug they offer. As for the latest food hits, they BRINE their chicken wings, and you can imagine that creates quite the spectacle of delectable.

    "text": "I have eaten here once in the past and had a fine experience.  When my fiance requested that a large group of our friends get together for his birthday for dinner here, I was more than happy to make a reservation. Unfortunately, after the initial reservation I have experienced nothing but problems. I made a reservation three days before, as our party was larger and we wanted to be there on a Saturday night. When making the reservation I waited on hold for a few minutes, but made the reservation easily.  Two days later I called back to add one more to our party, and was told that we could not be accommodated at the time that I had made the reservation (6:30). I was told that we would need to move our reservation back a half an hour (at least) and that our group would have to be seated at two separate tables. The hostess apologized, and I proceeded to call the half dozen people that had agreed to join us to inform them of the different time. I was already fairly upset, but figured that I should have paid better attention to the yelp reviews that stated the hosting staff had a hard time doing their jobs.   Five minutes before we are about to leave for our new 6:00 pm reservation, I get a call from the same hostess at Le Thai telling us that she has to move our reservation back to the original time! Unbelievable! She said that previous reservations had come in late, so now our table would not be ready (even though she had told me several times over the phone that if we weren't there exactly at 6:00 she would be giving our table away). Absolutely ridiculous. So I now had to, again, scramble to call a bunch of people and apologize for them changing the time! I figured that I would utilize the time waiting to write a yelp review warning others; do not bring a large party to Le Thai. What should have been an enjoyable, low-key birthday celebration instead was turned into a major headache. If we hadn't had a bunch of people planning on getting dinner here with us (and if we had time to make a reservation somewhere else) we would have just cancelled. We will definitely not be back.",

We checked with the hostess outside and we were told there was a 20 min wait unless we wanted to sit at the wall table in front of the kitchen. Those seats were perfect for two. I had the Awesome Noodles and they lived up to their name. I also tried the beef short rib fried rice with the fried egg on top. Wow!! This was the best fried rice I ever had Fo Sho! My wife had the Pad Kee Mow, another excellent dish. Son much good food in one place. The Rotti  for desert is a must. Any desert with Nutella is a must try and this one was one of ghe best I had.

It's a little cramped inside, but it was first Friday.  Spring rolls- These are vegan and deep fried. Delicious and I'm not vegan. I highly recommend them.  Pad See Ew- I got a 2 out of 5 and it was spicy. If you are sensitive like me I would get a 0 because this heat was real! I didn't quite sweat through my hair (as I usually do), but I was embarrassed at how much I was going through in front of my company. I personally like my pad see ew to be savory over spicy. So I guess that means I can't hang. I also really like a lot of egg and I don't recall having much of that.   They have a beer selection you'd expect at a Thai restaurant. I had a tall Chang. They give you a small clear plastic cup to drink it out of. I wasn't crazy about that, but didn't care once I was sweating.  Parking: Located on Fremont near 6th. I personally prefer to park on Carson and walk over, but I wait until after 6 so I don't have to pay. Otherwise I park at the El Cortez and walk over (free). Take care of yourself walking over by not engaging the homeless as sometimes they are aggressive and occasionally physical. Any woman who has been downtown enough should not find this too daunting.",

    "text": "We came here for an early dinner while on vacation in Vegas because I read somewhere to ignore the hype about Lotus of Siam (a favorite of some celebrities and the well-known downtown stalwart of Thai food) and come here instead. Le Thai is trendy but laid-back casual, and the food is spot-on.  (I also was a little turned off by the tiny portion sizes at Lotus of Siam - I know it's not all about size but I was really hungry this day.) Also, the fact that it's open all day and doesn't close between lunch and dinner is great.   All of us are picky about our Thai food (both my friends have traveled to Thailand) and we were completely satisfied and happy here. We just missed the lunch special which seemed like a great deal ($10 for a shorter menu of curries, stir-frys, etc. + a drink) but right in time for happy hour (drinks and most of the appetizers are half-off). The Thai Tea was huge and delicious.  Our waitress recommended a number of dishes but we went with the happy hour Chicken Satay (served with fantastic peanut sauce and a really nice fresh cucumber salad), the chicken 3 Color Curry (blend of red, green, and yellow) and Short Rib Fried Rice. We shared all of it between the three of us and took lots of leftovers home, so even though it's pricier than some Thai places, the portion sizes are generous.  Okay, it all was freaking amazing. The chicken satay came with 4 or 5 meaty skewers (none of those anorexic chicken pieces at some Thai places). The curry ($12) had all the flavor and heat that we were looking for and a nice ratio of chicken and veggies to sauce. We debated for too long about what heat-rating to give it because we like some heat (nose-running is good) but don't want to have to stop eating it - our waitress said that curry is always 1-2 ratings higher than what you order, so she suggested a 0 (I know, what??) but it was perfect.  The real show-stopper was the Short Rib Fried Rice (pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion and topped with cilantro, $13.50). I know this probably isn't True Thai cuisine, but it was TO DIE FOR. Perfectly tender short rib chunks, awesome fried rice, not too saucy, not too salty, amazing flavor explosions. Whatever waterfall sauce is, it is delicious (savory but with a little punch of smoky sweet). We took leftovers home and it maybe was even better the next time we ate it. I'm craving it right now and wish they could deliver it to Salt Lake.   Small dining room but there's a patio out back and plenty of seating (about 10 tables total and two counters plus the bar seating.) We had no wait but we were dining early for dinner at 3:30pm. It filled up slowly as the afternoon wore on - tables are a bit close together FYI. Seemed very clean, fun to watch the cooks through the window and the bartender at the bar. I know some have complained about the service, but we had great service, food arrived quickly but not too fast, refills were prompt. Our only beef was that when the waitress packaged up our leftovers, she didn't include the peanut dipping sauce for the remaining chicken satays - so sad.  Parking is a bit tricky as there are few spaces on Fremont - some metered parking on the side streets, but the neighborhood is a little sketchy even though it's improved quite a bit, so I wouldn't want to walk alone at night.   So glad we skipped the crowds on the Strip. I would come here again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Le Thai, more like Le awesome.  Great location, great food, and an awesome staff. The portions here are perfect and the flavor will explode your thai tasting brain.   After a brief moment of waiting outside my friend and I were brought in and sat at the bar. First thing I noticed, you can see right into the kitchen; the smells coming from it were intoxicating, which turned-up my hunger level to eleven. The decor of the restaurant is a mix of back alley dining with a few standard Thai musings on the wall. I love the vibe of this place... busting, loud and very unassuming.   The food here is filling and great to have with a group of friends while sipping drinks and telling drunken stories. If you're feeling super chatty and a bit buzzed, might I recommend what I ate, the Ga Pow!   Ga Pow is a heavy plate of ground pork (or chicken) with a spicy sauce, chopped veggies, and a big fat fried egg on top. This also comes with a side of white rice, but I opted for brown. This plate of food is more than enough for one eater and could definitely be shared if needed. The meat and veggies were cooked perfect, the pork was still firm and the veggies stayed crisp even though they were swimming in this delightful spicy sauce that I could not get enough of... I mean, hand me straw so I can finish slurping up this savory sensation! The bartender gave me an awesome tip which was to add lemon juice and the dry seasoning at the bar to my meal. I had to fight back the urge to bury my face this bowl.   My friend and I started with a soup before our main courses showed up, but sadly I can't remember the name! I know it was first on the soup list and we had fried tofu added to it. This was delicious, an amazing flavorful broth with a few hard boiled eggs in it and multiple levels of zesty flavor... this mystery will kill me!  A few notes...  - When the weather is cooperating, I recommend sitting outside in their back patio area. Clean, spacious, and you really can't beat Vegas weather when it's in the low 80's.  - If you find yourself waiting outside for a while, just belly up to the window. Yup, there's a little drive-thru window you can walk right up to and order a beer or cocktail and sip with your friends while you wait. Great f**king idea!   PRO-TIP: Check-in and get a squeezable surprise.",

Pad Thai doesn't look impressive, when I took my first morsel I tasted the fish/squid sauce taste-wow salty!!! I told the waiter that it's salty & he did not even care to ask if I want to change it, like I said I was hungry so to dilute the saltiness I just ordered rice to go with it.   Their Thai Style Fried Rice is salty as well...  The service is not that great as well, I did not feel welcome & not even thanked for dinning it. It seems that people who work here does not valued their customers.   I looked at their kitchen they do not have even have a single Asian/Thai chef-so what do you expect?   I suggest that their cook needs to be trained by original Thai Chef if they want to keep their business. I also recommend them to dine in at President Thai in Rosemead CA or even at The Original Thai BBQ in West Covina, LA, or Glendale for them to taste how original  Thai Food is.  Pricey & quality of food NO Good! Not coming back.",

    "text": "We went here before watching a musical at Smiths Center. Parking wasn't bad when we went. This is located across the street from Insert Coins in Downtown Vegas. They have happy hour from 3-6pm Monday-Friday and Saturday from 11am-4pm which includes pork jerky, wings, chicken satay, waterfall beef and of course, alcohol. They have Stella, Chang, San Miguel beer, vodka, rum, tequila, gin, wine, Spiked Thai Iced Tea and a drink interestingly called Ladyboy Cocktail. Since getting hammered while wearing a dress before Les Miserables might not be such a great idea, I didn't partake in happy hour which means I'd have to come back. I had non-spiked Thai Iced Tea instead.  We got Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp spicy 3/5, Garlic Fried Rice with chicken spicy 3/5, Spicy Eggplant with tofu and Short Rib Fried Rice. We finished our meal with an order of Roti.  Pad Thai: What I noticed was that it doesn't come with crushed peanuts but it still tastes good. Great flavor. Spicy, lightly salty and sweet - the classic Thai flavor combination. 4/5  Garlic Fried Rice: I should have ordered this dish at spicy 2/5 instead. I missed out on the garlic taste and my nose was running. My bad. It's a delicious dish though and I'm sure I would have tasted flavor elevations had my tastebuds not been burned. 4/5  Spicy Eggplant: In an attempt to eat something healthy with all the meat and carb dishes we got, we decided to get a veggie dish and add tofu instead of meat. Tasty dish with bell peppers, onion in Thai chili sauce. 3.5/5  Short Rib Fried Rice: The best dish we tried. Tender, juicy shreds of mildly sweet short rib...sooo good. I couldn't stop eating this. 5/5  Roti: Nutella spread on roti topped with egg drizzled with condensed milk and dusted with powdered sugar. It's sweet but not overly sweet. I love Nutella so I was bound to like this dessert. The fried egg on top cuts the sweetness of the dish. 4/5  Great service. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They get real busy by around 6pm. The prices weren't bad.",

The entire bill was about $80 but consisted of 3 drinks, larb, awesome noodles, chicken wings, cucumber salad, and a Thai omelette. Considering the location, this price is very reasonable. The drinks were very solid and the spice level, though not overwhelming, was quality. If you can stand the wait of 30 minutes at all times of the night, I recommend coming here. Not the best Thai food in the city but quite good.",

    "text": "Oh man, this is a great restaurant.  I've never really been to Fremont street, but next time I'm in Las Vegas I'm staying there, eating here, and spending more time in this area.  We parked at a nearby lot for $3 an hour and walked on in.  We were quickly seated by a friendly host and given menus.  We looked them over and decided to go with the Thai wings, the short rib fried rice, and the 3 color (red, green, yellow) curry.  We were given some spicy peanuts to snack on while we waited for our wings.  After around 5 or 6 minutes from the time we ordered the wings were out.  They were fantastic.  I have no idea what makes a wing a 'Thai Wing', but what I do know is that these were some amazing wings.  The sriacha ranch sauce was a perfect complement to the crispy wings, and we ate them up in no time.  Seriously, get these as an appetizer.  We wanted them as the entire meal, up until we got the rest of our meal!  The rest of the meal came out just as we were finishing the wings.  Both dishes were excellent.  The 3 color curry was awesome.  They didn't go easy on the meat like a lot of places do, and there was tons of good vegetables in it.  I could have eaten the fried rice for a long time.  I will say that I wish I had gone hotter on the curry, but it's always hard to decide what spicy level to do on your first time at a new place.    Overall this was an amazing meal.  This was our last meal on a week long trip through Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, and this was by far my favorite meal.",

    "text": "Yay, we found another Thai spot we like!  We went early on a Sunday. Like, blue plate special early...right at 4pm (but we had our 4-year-old in tow and none of us had eaten lunch).   The vibe and atmosphere is very laid back, casual, and fun. They have bistro lighting in the back, so I think it would be a really great informal date night spot. Definitely want to come back with just my husband sometime.   We got waterfall beef and Thai salad (chicken) to start. That salad was the best Thai salad I've ever had. Our daughter got drunken noodles (shrimp). Then we all shared panang chicken curry and whatever the first beef stir fry option listed is. Everything was super tasty and very, very flavorful.   The service was great, except you have to box up your own food if you have leftovers (again, because of the vibe we expected this since it's more laid back here).    I wish they had a few more items to choose from, but I get that the place is small so I'm sure the kitchen is tiny. Love it and already trying to plan a date night for next time.",

I enjoyed how it was located in downtown Las Vegas so there was a lot to do after eating including going to a bar or just looking at street art. The bartender greeted us right when we entered and we were given the option to sit anywhere we liked. We went around 4pm so happy hour was going on. The dishes we ordered were waterfall beef, spicy eggplant with shrimp, and chicken pad Thai. The presentation of each dish was incredible and the tastes were even better. The waterfall beef was served with sticky rice which I'm not a fan of, but I ended up enjoying it. I had a taste of the pad Thai,it had all the flavors a pad Thai should have. With the spicy eggplant I enjoyed how they didn't use jumbo shrimps and the eggplant was cooked perfectly. Our server was very friendly and checked up on us a couple times. I honestly can't wait to go back to try other dishes from the menu.",

    "text": "It hurts my heart to give this place such a low rating.  Le Thai came highly recommended by numerous Vegas locals that I spoke to. While on a trip with my husband and 11 year old sister we decided to satisfy our hankering for some Thai food. It's a relatively small restaurant with an even smaller front patio seating area but they do have plenty of seating in their patio out back. It was there that we ordered just about everything but their kitchen sink. The Thai tea, spiked Thai tea, and selection of hot teas would've been enough to get me to come back. The drunken noodles, three color curry, waterfall beef, and tom kha were an added bonus. Now, with that being said... I was disappointed by their lack of sincerity on their hostesses part. We almost left because she put our names down for a table and told us it would be about a 10-15 minute wait since the little one would NOT be allowed inside the restaurant and she'd need to be seated outside. Ok, weird policy but eh it's not my restaurant and they're allowed to do as they please. I figured it might have something to do with having a bar inside. Who knows. Anyway, after 45 minutes I asked if they could seat us at any of the 6 empty tables we could clearly see weren't being used out back. A gentleman said there were people ahead of us but that he could check to see if we could sit along a counter/barstool set up they have along their walls. He then immediately sat us. The waitress was friendly and very attentive, so were the cockroaches. One literally crawled down the wall and on to our plate. Ew! Ok Fremont Street is an old neighborhood and I get that it's hard to keep pests down. A few moments later my sister dropped her napkin. It landed next to a few more scurrying cockroaches and we all decided that we were done with our meals. I spend quite a bit of time checking out mom and pop shops around that area but I've never seen a place with such a bad infestation. Like they need to possibly be shut down. I'm terrified to think what their kitchen's condition might be in",

The host greeted them at the door and sat them, even though we were there first. When he came back, he told us they had no more seats, and there would be a long wait. So we left. There is a ramen place around the corner with far better manners!",

It's a small place with very few tables, a tiny bar, and a wonderful little patio that features heat lamps in the winter and cooling in the summer. Ahhhh.  Pros - That patio. - The food is authentic, delicious, and actually spicy. I've tried the Pad Thai, the yellow curry, and the three-color curry, and all the appetizers, and I've loved everything. - The price is right; you can get 2 dinners, an appetizer, and 2 beers for about $35, and leave fat, tipsy, and happy  Cons - Limited size of the restaurant plus their newly \"discovered by the mainstream\" status means that when they are busy, waits can be long and service can be slow.",

The presentation was a bit unusual, the rice was at the bottom of the bowl, covered by a layer of chicken and topped with an \"over easy\" egg with the yoke liquid so it did flow on the other ingredients below. Unusual but good. Under $10 with tips and including a drink so quite a good deal.",

I had a spice level 4 (scale 1-5) and it was a nice amount of heat.  I didn't mind sitting outside, although it is still a bit chilly now.

Truly. This last time, we sat for a half an hour waiting to pay before I went to find the waitress, split the bill myself, so we could leave. As I was walking back with the ticket book in my hand, some other annoyed customers asked if I would run their cards (thinking that I worked there), so I can only assume that they were waiting forever as well.   Also, that ordering system by looking at the iPhone is straight up rude. There is a way to look like you are engaged with your customers while holding a phone in your hand, and they need to master this.   The food is really tasty, but the prices went up a couple dollars since I was last there, and the service was still lacking.   I just know not to have the highest of expectations because I'm sure I'll be back eventually. Good food, sad service.",

    "text": "I first read about this place in \"Eating Las Vegas- The 50 Essential Restaurants\" and was excited to see a place from downtown make the list.  I am a big fan of Thai (Pad Thai specifically) and while I've found a few good places, I haven't found anything which I return to on a normal basis.  This place is small, located on East Fremont street in the vicinity of Commonwealth.  Wait was 60 min for a party of 3, but the cool thing is they send you a text with a website to track your place in line, so my party was able to venture off to other places and let the hour fly by.  Le Thai has a very downtown feel which is different from other Vegas establishments, the small kitchen is right off the dining area and they have an outdoor section.  The menu is pretty simple and I'd say most if not all of the items were under $15.  I had a spring roll and Pad Thai w/ Chicken and it was a very reasonable portion!  The noodles had a bit of spice for ordering mild, but I welcomed it.  For the price and quality of food I felt this place blew Lotus of Siam out of the water and will now become my \"go to\" Thai place.",

They said I was the first order of the day. I got there at 11:15, my food was hot and ready for me at the bar, no waiting, no fuss...I was in and out. I got spicy level 4 on a 1-5 scale. It was oh so spicy, just how I like it...never a disappointment.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this Thai place and will be coming back when I'm in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 3 star.  I could have gone to a 5, I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.",

The short rib fried rice with waterfall sauce was always the big draw. This year they lost our business. We made a reservation and when we got there at the specified time the hostess said it would be a 35 minute wait because we hadn't \"checked in.\" One person from our party had gone in to use the bathroom and said he saw about 10 open tables inside. I don't know what kind of a place refuses to seat a party of 7 at the time of their reservation, especially when there are available tables, but we didn't stick around to find out. We went next door to La Comida instead and had a great time.",

I'm not talking about the wait to be seated, I'm talking from the time we ordered until we got our food...over 30 minutes. My buddy was there with me and we both ordered, when his food was ready they just put it to the side to wait for mine, needless to say his food was not hot and was only warm.  This place is over priced and after eating less than half my food I gave up and just threw the rest away",

    "text": "Dinner before drinking was the plan but we ended up drinking at Commonwealth before (and after) dinner. Called ahead to make a reservation but they didn't have anything early available, but when we arrived in person they found a spot for us pretty quickly. One of our party members knows people that work there so that helped. I was starving too so I'm glad we got in earlier.  Let's see if I remember everything we got: pork jerky, thai chicken wings, pad thai, pad see ew, three color curry, fried rice, drinks. Lots of yummy stuff that was being passed about. My favorite was the pork jerky with the chicken wings coming in second. I don't eat noddles or rice, so nibbling the meat out of those dishes does not really give me a good idea of the dishes, though I remember lots of flavor; I must've been grabbing all the good meat pieces.  I think we could've gone a little spicier for our food but the level 3 spiciness wasn't bad.  Atmosphere was good too. Cute little place.  Shout out to the awesome chef Mike for sending us amazing food! Our server (Dean? I think. Tall guy.) was awesome too and very friendly/attentive. We ordered way too much food for our party of 5 and gave the leftovers to the bouncer at Commonwealth. Good night overall. I would like to go back next time I'm in town.",

(Humid hotspot) Luckily I'm used to the humid weather being from TN but I can see where it might be an issue for some. We showed up for an early dinner and were seated immediately.  Food:  I like a kick with my thai food and when it comes to Thai food I see restaurants rate their spiciness level on two scales. People who know Thai spice and people who don't. This is definitely a place that uses the level for people that don't. We ordered a dish with a heat level of \"3\" which I believe was \"hot\" but it honestly wasnt bad at all.  As far as the overall food discussion goes - this is one of the best thai places I've been to that is able to cater to both those who love thai good and those that are just trying it for the first time.  We ordered some Thai style wings and these were probably some of the best wings I have ever had. I'd like to think of myself as a wing junkie and these are definitely a must-try.  I got the pad see ewe at a \"3\" and taste wise it was great. Spice wise I needed to add more to get the kick I wanted.  We also ordered the red curry at a \"2\" and my girlfriend loved it. - She definitely avoids the spice but she also said she could've kicked it up a bit.  The drinks were strong. The ice melted extremely quick so after about 5mins it was watered down but thats not their fault.  Service: I've read in previous reviews that there was a common issue with a hostess however our hostess sat us immediately and we didn't have an issue at all with her.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and our food came out quickly.  Overall: I will definitely make another trip here when I'm out in Vegas again. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.",

The waterfall beef is just as good, only, it is from a cow...  * The Thai Style Wings (with sriracha ranch) are the best wings downtown.  Period.  * Their Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) is the definition of what a spicy noodle dish should be.  Lots of everything: flavor, protein, noodles, & spice.  * My recent discovery is the garlic fried rice.  I am big on garlic & this dish is HUGE on flavor.  The portions are generous, service at the bar, where I usually sit at lunch or late nights, is always good.  The Thai Iced Coffee is flavorful & strong.  The only issue is their popularity.  On weekends, it can be an hour wait, even at midnight.    Chances are, on a Friday late night, I'll be at the bar, wolfing down something while the band is on a break.  ENJOY!",

Service was great as well. What I would give 4 stars: our main course. Both my husband & I ordered Awesome Noodle dish. It was tasty. Not the #1 best Thai I've ever had, but definitely yummy. Here's my one critique: the dish was very monochromatic. It was all brown, no color from veggies or anything. It was a bit off-putting. The taste was much better than I expected from looking at the dish. Just some carrot slivers or peppers would go a long way towards making the dish look as yummy as it tasted! I'd definitely go back here though, it was a good experience all around.",

    "text": "5 Stars for Service and Location. 4 Stars for Food 3 Stars for Price 4 Stars Overall  This place has been bookmarked, but always avoided because it's always packed whenever I'm out here.  Because of the long waits, reservations are a must.  This was my first time at Le Thai with zero wait because we had reservations. This also might be due to quiet Thursday night. Met up with the Wonder Twins aka  Alicia R. and Terri R. for dinner.  The restaurant is as small as advertised, but there was plenty of room since it wasn't packed.  We were seated immediately, but felt that our orders took a little longer than I expected since they weren't busy yet. Our orders were eventually taken and we were all given our shots of water.   I ended up ordering their Thai Chicken Wings and Garlic Chicken Fried Rice.  I shared one piece of chicken wings with Alicia R. but had the rest for myself.  You could of have timed me. I killed everything in less than 15 minutes.  The Thai wings were seasoned with what I call a BBQ taste with a sweet happy ending.  Here's the difference with these wings, the taste is on the inside, not the outside.  The initial bite is okay, then you get to the meat where you feel the flavor.  Hard to describe, but imagine BBQ with a sweet buttery after taste.  Yes, it's obvious that I'm a fan of their wings.  Now for their garlic fried rice.  This was so full of flavor and reminded me of what my pops would make.  The serving is huge and might have been made for two, but tonight it was just for me.  The thick pieces of chicken only complimented it. Not saying Le Thai's is better than Dad C.  Just saying, It's damn good.  I finished my meal, Terri R. finished hers, and Alicia R. ate half and boxed the rest. I feel so terrible because I knocked Alicia's food all over the floor while giving her a goodbye hug. Alicia, if you're reading this, I owe you one.   I thought the prices for the wings were about average and the price for the fried rice was a little steep considering it's just fried rice. My pops would never charge me, at least not that much.  My only other issue with price is their $6.50 bottle of Fiji water.  I really wanted a bottle but couldn't justify a bottle costing nearly as much as the wings. So, I settled with their kid's cup of water that they serve.   You can say I'm a fan of Le Thai.  There's not too many great eats in DTLV at night.  So, location is a definite plus.  Since I tend to take family and out of town friends to downtown, this just might be a perfect stop for some wings, noodles, and fried rice.  However, pops might think differently about the fried rice.  PS:  I forgot to get my free hug for checking in. Good gesture, but no thanks.  I'll save it for last year.",

I immediately looked at my boyfriend with utmost disgust and pulled out my phone.

Well, good thing, since I don't live there anymore, but this is even BETTER!!!!! Goodness gracious it is so good. It's sweet, it's spicy, the noodles are fresh, the beef is flavorful and tender....I get medium level spice and then just go to town on the Sriracha. 10 minutes later my nose is running and my ears are clogged, but it hurts so good!!!!!",

We ordered: Pad See Ewe: with beef spicy level 2.  The slices of beef were tender and flavorful...actually, the whole bowl of this flat rice noodle is flavorful.   Short Rib Fried Rice:  Was delicious as well.  I got this at spice level 0, but it tasted as if it was cooked with some spice.  Maybe the fried rice was cooked in the same wok that was used to cook something else that had spice...  Next time, we will ask for a wedge of lime/lemon to add a touch of citrus note to both of this entree.  Debbie ordered the Awesome Noodle at spicy level 3, but Earl's Pad See Ewe at level 2 was spicier than Debbie's.  Highly advised that you should start at level 1, and ask for the spice rack.

A short walk and we were there, and seated promptly in the small main dining room at a two top.  Based on a couple Yelper quick tips I decided on the Awesome Flat Noodles with pork accompanied by bean sprouts, onions, and green onion with a garlic strip fry sauce.  My Mom got a chicken soup (the non-coconut based one).  We both decided on medium heat after some help from our server.  Medium was the perfect level of spiciness for us, just enough to make your lips tingle with joy.  The Awesome Flat Noodle dish was just that, awesome.  Lots of pork and bean sprouts.  I ate the entire thing, a little embarrassed to say so.  Service was lack luster, nothing good, nothing bad, just basic if ask me but the food was the stand out.  Great Thai food found on Fremont street is a treat and we left happy with full bellies.",

I personally enjoy any opportunity to find my way downtown and more importantly to try new eateries.  Le Thai has been on my list for a while.  Enthusiastic and hungry we approached the hostess stand only to be told there was a 60-minute wait *insert pouty face here*. No problem, we killed time next door until our seats were ready.  I must have looked unusually disappointed or totally starving because not even 15 minutes later we were being paged that our seats were ready! SCORE!  Ambiance can be best described as a hole-in-the-wall reminiscent of most restaurants in NYC (or Chicago).  It's cool without being smug about it.    Most importantly the food: excellent portion sizes, bold flavors, spice level was right on point. Their spice chart is 1-4 and we went with 2's all across the board. My friend was sweating, my nose was running but man oh man was it worth it.   I can recall Le Thai not taking reservations in the past, but since they do currently, I highly recommend taking that extra step in securing your seating. The hostess took pity on us THIS time, but to ensure you are seated in a reasonable fashion, make a res.  Le Thai is something that should be on your list of \"to try\".",

We alerted the server and watched her take it back to the kitchen (which you can see through a big window) they just had a good laugh. Fuck them. I'm not going back and neither should you.   Thanks to yelp it looks like I get the last laugh now. Unless you enjoy eating muddy lettuce avoid this shit hole.",

Yes, the food was good, some of the best I've had in Vegas, but the server only checked in once. We were told they ran out of silverware and the dishes, so we had to use what we had, no fresh plates. This place is busy every night, how do they run out of dishes? The drinks also took a ridiculously long time, about 20 minutes a drink. This place has been a tradition when hitting up downtown for a long time, but I think it's time to look at other places.  Update:  Gave it another shot last week and everything was better, service seemed improved and they actually had dishes!",

Next time it will be a level 2, but the Pad Thai was so good I couldn't stop eating it! I powered through, runny nose and all.   I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone in the downtown area.

We ended up waiting 45 mins with no update information or apology. Another party of two was seated as soon as they walked in. We had to approach her and ask why we hadn't been seated. She said they were just seated there but aren't able to order because the cooks had too many tickets? After bragging about how amazing this place was I was livid and eating my words instead actual food. Because of this incident, I will no longer eat or recommend that poor excuse for a restaurant to anybody. That hostess has the worst customer service and should be in the kitchen where socializing with customers is non-existent!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the Downtown area, it's gelling into an authentic urban streetscape that makes me want to move to the area just so I can see it realtimes...albeit I like it more at night than in the daylight hours... (less visible decay)... don't hate me...  I wanted to get more involved with Downtown, and when The Downtown Project presented a panel series of inspirational speakers, I decided it was time to climb out of my nested cocoon and head on down.  And to piggyback the event, I wanted to try Le Thai, a much raved Thai restaurant that recently opened on Freemont Street.  And from the street, the place looks awesome; from the modernness of the corrugated steel facade juxtaposed with the the retro neon signage, it's managed to synthesize old and new Vegas without any gaudy Disney/stripper pole/bordello theme in which the Strip seems to steep itself until a bitter brew.  It's a breath of fresh air, frankly and with other venues like Commonwealth and Velveteen Rabbit bring life to an already transform Freemont Street, it'll making coming Downtown an enjoyable night out.  With the Maitre' D out front, it looked like the interior was super tiny and jam packed, but there's outdoor seating in back with heat lamps, which turned out to be a roomier sitting area.  This would be a great place to sit and drink in the coming months before the heat sets in, not quite sure how they would cool that space...   One wall is covered with a colorful mural, but otherwise, it stays True to an outdoor atmosphere with exposed wood beam frame, rope lights and garden furniture.  Seeing one of my favorite appetizers on the menu, I was excited and anticipated a great evening: Pork Jerky + Sticky Rice + Waterfall Sauce. And when it arrived, it did not disappoint, juicy bits of succulent Pork accompanied with a most amazing Sauce bringing it to a higher level of flavor.  And with the Sticky Rice, its just such a comforting dish I feel like I'm at home...  And as a measuring stick, I always judge a Thai restaurant by it's Pad See Ewe.  I ordered the spice level of two (normally zero) just to gage how Le Thai handles its hotness scale.  When it came to the table, it arrived in a large heaping bowl, steaming, piping, right-out-of-the-wok furnace of noodles, where you know you're gonna sweat halfway through the meal. It's a love/hate relationship, appreciative and ~~~~at the same time..  A spice level two at Le Thai was not quite as I expected; for it had an unsurmountable amount of spice, (as a Thai for 'not too spice' and they might as well pour gasoline down your throat and chuck a match) which would have been fine, but the dish lacked that Soy umami flavor in which Pad See Ewe comes in abundance, the flat broad noodles sucking in that sauce and trapping it it's chewy cells.  To top it off, by adding the searing heat of a thousand suns, it was hard to taste much of the dish. A shame, since I was very impressed with the quality and amount of Beef, as well the Chinese Broccoli- you can tell the ingredients were premium, just the balance was off.  As a test, I had the cold leftovers the next day, and it was the same, lotta heat, little Soy. Somewhat of a disappointment.  However, since I only had two dishes with a fifty/fifty success rating, I vow to come again and order more and reach outside my comfort zone before the final strike of the gavel.  I loved the ambience and the service was impeccable.    Ratings (Out Of Five Stars) Food:           4 Ambience:   5 Service:        5",

The parking is free if you park there early enough otherwise it's a few bucks to park in the metered section. The location itself is great. It has patio seating outside and also extended seating inside with more extended seating outside towards the back.  Upon walking in we were greeted by a server who shouted. . . How many? It was just 2 guests so we sat right near the window table near the front door. We were seated on a deuce and it was still rather dirty. It had prints from the previous guest and also oil stains. I really wish they would have wiped it more thoroughly.  About a minute later the server comes and says hello. She let us know of the lunch specials and told us that they were ending in 3 minutes and that we would have to quickly decide if that's what we wanted. We felt rushed so we politely declined and opted for the normal menu. I ordered the pad Thai and my friend ordered the wide noodle with beef. We also ordered a white rice as well. Both were really delicious and full of flavor! The server Never Brought The White Rice That We had requested, which was annoying. For dessert,  we got the mango and sticky rice and it was delicious!  The mango was juicy and sweet and the rice had the perfect texture! I'm not sure if I would eat here again. I felt rushed and forgotten at this place and I think it may need to work on its cleanliness a bit. Other than that, the food was good. I can't knock em for that.",

Don't order anything until you try the beef jerky with Dan's famous Waterfall Sauce, and for your main entree, you have to try the Drunkin noodles, three color curry and the Pad Thai. Don't forget when ordering the temperature level that their scale is 1-5 so order extra water if you decide go go with a 5. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Oh my goodness... this is probably one of my favorite Thai places in Las Vegas. It's not really a hole in wall because everyone knows about it and just how good it is.   My first tip make reservations! There's not a lot of seating so when it gets busy (which is usually all the time), the wait can become pretty long! Oh and make sure that most of the party is there or they won't seat you. This can be frustrating but understandable as they are extremely busy at all times. There is a little patio out front which is a great spot to grab a drink while you wait for your table.    Now the food - my favorite dish is the Short Rib Fried Rice... it's like crack. No matter how much I eat of it, it's NEVER enough. Another great dish (as an appetizer) is the Waterfall Beef. The sauce that comes with this dish is to die for. Another great dish is just their Pad Thai. I have also tried a number of other dishes and I am never disappointed. Another tip - when you order the server will inquire how spicy (1-5) you would like your dish. I did a 3 the first time I was there, and I almost died from the spice (and I love spicy food), so be careful. :)  If you're downtown - this is a no-brainer, defiantly check this place out. You won't regret it! AND if the wait is too long... order it too go! Usually takes about 15 minutes or so to get everything prepared and it's just as good in your hotel room or at home!",

On a separate occasion, I tried the pad Thai and from what I remember it was okay also.",

They make it impossible to get in for dinner and seem not to care to tell people it will be a 2+ hour wait. Or have you waiting an hour past your listed time. To be a local and drive downtown for dinner to enjoy a restaurant you love and consistently go to and be treated with below average service is not what Vegas is about. Change your reservation system and service Le Thai!",

I love the decor they have here, unfortunately, they have a lot of outdoor seating and if you know Vegas, it is freaking hot and you're eating spicy food! We came during a crowded time so we sat at the bar. We ordered a pad see ew and the short rib fried rice. We got spicy level of 7 on a scale of 10 and it was not spicy at all. I was expecting 7 to be like thai spicy where you feel like your face is going to melt off. It's all good though, just add extra peppers. :). The pad see ew was solid and the short rib fried rice was SO GOOD! It was exceptional and the flavors blend together so well. Prices are decent at $12 per dish. Also, next time I would love to try their alcoholic thai drinks like my dirty thai and a thaijito!  Overall, great service and great food for a solid price! If you're in the area, give this place a go!",

It's not a very big place so there is usually a wait especially when it is cold out but we managed to get seated without much of a wait.  We ended up getting the crab rangoon for an appetizer and I had the larb salad for dinner. I rangoon was good... I am not sure that there was any crab in it but it was good. The larb salad was fine... the chicken was good but I think the waitress scared us off the spiciness a bit so I went lower than usual. It was definitely American and not Thai spiciness.   I think this is a decent option but it's not the best Thai I've ever had. With so many great options around Vegas, I don't know if I'll get back to this one again.",

We ordered:   Pork Jerky, one of the best I've ever had, the sauce was nice and tangy, with a little kick. Very authentic style cooking, it's hard to find it this good.  Drunken Shrimp Noodles, nice textured flat noodles and shrimp was pretty good sized, I like the fact that they didn't skimp out on the amount of shrimp. My girlfriend loved this.  And the Ga Pow (Mint Leaf/Basil) Chicken ((Spicy Level 3)) -- this was very close to the street cart style food we're accustomed to.  We're from LA and luckily spoiled with great Thai food. When we're in Vegas, we will be sure to come back here because it is the best in town.  Kathy was our server, she was very prompt and courteous with her service. One thing we loved about her was how fast she changed our plates and refilled our ice waters (very rare Asian restaurant trait).   Thanks Le Thai! See you soon.",

Nothing special about the Rangoon or wings but both were good. I would, however, go back to order the fried rice again. The tenderness and meaty bits really made the rice special.   P.s.

    "text": "So this is a long story but I thought it was comical enough to post on here. Came here last night (9/11) after reading all the great reviews.  I expected a long wait but the hostess said that she could seat us at the bar after the bartender cleared it off. There were three of us sitting on the bench inside waiting for the three open bar seats. I see this guy walk up to the bar and sit down. He starts ordering and I'm thinking, hopefully he's just getting a to go order? A few mins later, I guess that guys friends come out of the main dining room and tell him they're leaving and he says bye and stays at the bar. So we get seated and dude is still sitting there and now he's ordering food. We get drinks and the guy next to us starts talking to the bartender about how important he is and how much business he brings in here. He then asks if he can talk to a manager. I then hear (behind us) the girl that was sitting next to us on the bench asking a worker if she's going to be seated next. I turned around and told her quietly that I think that guy just took your seat. She seemed upset (she had every right to be) and left.  Dude at the bar has no clue that he just took the seat of a person who was patiently waiting - like the rest of the commoners lol. So we order our food and guy next to us is now talking to a worker but he's still asking for someone \"higher-up\" because again, he always brings a lot of people here - 25-30 people, all the time lol. We get it, you bring a lot of people here. (This place has a high ass rating and I'm pretty sure they'll get the business even without your posse.) As he's sitting there, his cup breaks - like he bottom of the cup straight up falls off leaving a huge mess and I tell Cam that's \"karma\" or my amazing super powers mentally broke his cup for being so annoying. In addition to breaking his cup and making a mess on the counter, now his food is too spicy he's asking Cam for his napkin to wipe himself. So fast forward, he finally gets to talk to someone, we hear him tell the worker the same information - I'm so important, blah blah... then the guy has the audacity to ask for his entire meal to be comped because for whatever reason - I guess they didn't have room for his large party of five - on a Monday night, during the dinner rush, at a place that doesn't really have reservations lol. Manager - I hope you're reading this because I pray you did not comp that douche nuggets food. He finally left and that's the end of that.  On to my real review, we get our food, it's delicious, I'm sad I only ate here once and I would come back the next time I'm in Vegas. They also sell such a great assortment of beer - try the Kawabo - and for two meals (yellow chicken curry, rice and pad kee mao), two beers and a side of rice was like $50.00 (not including tip). We had a great time, friendly workers, fast service and over all a nice time.  Great date spot but hopefully you won't get stuck next to the dude we sat next to during your dinner.",

    "text": "My first impression of this place was really wonderful. The place is small yet comfortable, the hostess was super friendly on the phone and in person AND our server was a very friendly vegan! That last part was my favorite because it feels so rare to find other vegans and I was psyched to have a server fully understand how it feels to order food at a non vegan restaurant. Im sure I come off as needy and overly inquisitive when I go out to eat, so it's a relief to have a vegan take your order. They get it.   The server started by explaining the vegan options and how a majority of items can be veganized and I was so excited! I ordered the pad see ew with mixed veggies and steamed tofu - spicy level 2 out of 5 - and their spin off of a Thai Julip (can't remember the name but it was amazing)  For a 2, my pad see ew tasted more like a 0.. but the flavor was great! I never thought to inspect my food because, I mean, a vegan took my order so it will be totally vegan right? Low and behold, I find little bits of scrambled EGG in it after having eaten several bites. I was crushed.   After bringing it to the waiters attention, he was very upset to have let something like that happen and asked if he could have the cook remake the dish but at that point my appetite was gone. He took the dish off the bill and gave us a discount, as well as being very apologetic about the mistake.   By the time I got home, my stomach had turned and I was so sick my boyfriend called the restaurant. Neither of us expected that little bit of egg to cause me so much grief but I guess after not eating it for such a long time, my stomach was NOT cool with it. Management totally took care of this situation over the phone and I am really looking forward to giving Le Thai another chance.  It sucks for this to happen but I'm not going to give them a shitty review for making one error. We are human and at the end of the day, humans make errors.",

It took 40 minutes just to get inside. When we did finally enter the restaurant, we realized that there was a large patio out the back - easily three times the size of the dining space inside - with no less than 5 open tables.   The food - for all the hype - was mediocre. The chicken satay was pretty good - well-seasoned and juicy - but the pad see eau was far too sweet instead of savory as it should be, and the waterfall beef was flavorless. The portion sizes were good, but there wasn't much to write home about.   There aren't many places in downtown Las Vegas to grab Thai at, and with decent prices, I can see why people would consider it an alright place to eat. However, for a better dining experience and superior food, I would highly recommend bypassing Le Thai in favor of one of the many Archi's restaurants around town and avoid this tourist trap.",

I ordered the yellow curry and my friend ordered the short rib fried rice. Both spice level 3 and both delicious! I love the curry and as I was happily eating away at my plate my friend noticed a little hair in my plate and took it out. This was not a big deal to us at all. It's hair. Could of came from anywhere! The point of this review is that Renee noticed my friend grab it and without us saying anything, she went ahead and comped us the curry instead of charging us. We were happily surprised by the gesture and it for sure cemented my desire to get Thai food from them over the other places around. It's small acts like the one mentioned above that really makes the already great food pair with great service. To summarize. It was a great time from spiked thai tea, appetizers, and entrees. On our way out several employees wished us well and I will be happy to return to eat once again! Thank you for being great Renee!",

Been here a few times now and the food is pretty solid - always have gone for pad see ew and short rib fried rice. Tried waterfall beef the last time and will prob be getting that from now on. So good, I can probably put the sauce on anything and it'll make whatever I'm eating taste better.   During summer Be aware: sometimes you're not sure if you're at a restaurant or the niagara falls because they have misters set at 6/5 on their back patio that drench you and your food lol.   However food is tasty and service is hit or miss depending on who you get. Mostly hit. Lol",

    "text": "I love Le Thai.  I've been going regularly since they opened and I'm always quick to introduce friends to the place.  Another one of those restaurants that sort of hides in plain sight, it sits quietly next to the Commonwealth on Fremont Street between 6th and Las Vegas Blvd.  The menu is relatively small, but has something for most fans of Thai food.  Everything is cooked fresh, the food is delicious, and you can choose how how you'd like your dish to be.  Portions are just the right size for lunch and dinner.  If you order a bowl of soup though, you may end up taking some home.  You truly get a bowl of soup, but it's worth it.  The wait staff is super friendly.  Seating is limited (some indoors and some covered on the patio in the back), and a little bit at the bar, so get there when they open, or be prepared for a small wait.  Even if you have to wait though, seats seem to open up quick enough so that the wait isn't usually too bad.  And for those interested, you can see into the kitchen!  If you don't have something already in mind, try the Awesome Flat Noodles, Ga Pow or Pad Prik with a Thai Iced Tea.  The Cucumber Salad is a fantastic side dish.  Just go.  You'll thank me later.",

I ordered the panag curry and pad thai. Both very delicious dishes! I would love to actually sit down inside the restaurant and order different things. The curry was rich and very flavorful.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to like this place. A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.  The food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?! The only reason I gave three stars is because I liked the staff and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go.",

The dishes here are pretty tasty!! I wouldn't say Le Thai is THE go to place for authentic Thai cuisine but the food here is flavorful so I can definitely understand why people rave about it.  I've tried their Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad See Ewe, Short Rib Fried Rice, and Yellow Chicken Curry. Everything was very good but their Pad Thai wasn't my favorite. There were a few odd ingredients... a lot of shredded carrots and cilantro which isn't normally in Pad Thai. They may have tried to make a signature infused Le Thai version of Pad Thai but I much rather prefer the traditional.   Service is not bad for being so busy! I can't recall anything negative. Friendly and my water was never empty...   I would choose more of an authentic Thai restaurant if I wanted Thai, however, I would recommend Le Thai if you're craving Asian food while downtown!",

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this Thai place. Location, service, food and drinks....5 stars to me!!!!  I love that it's in the center of downtown LV. I get to walk around and bar hop during the day, and come eat some bomb ass Thai food afterwards. My most recent visit here was actually during the day with a girlfriend. So of course, we had to take advantage of the happy hour. Ordered a few rounds of their mimosas (me love my mimosa!!!), I had the yellow chicken curry with rice and pork chops with a sweet and sour sauce. We also ordered pad Thai, and cream cheese ragoons. I loved everything we ordered honestly. If you're ever in the mood to try Le Thai though, one thing I would suggest that you MUST get is their Pad Thai. They probably have the best Pad Thai in Vegas, in my opinion. Just watch out for their spice levels....they can get pretty spiiiicy up in there!   Here's a tip: if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free Thai tea! I didn't get to use mine because we were drinking mimosas. But definitely the next time I come, I'm drinking my much deserved Thai tea!",

    "text": "I have read so many great reviews about this place and heard so many people praise it.  I tried it twice.   I want to start by saying that the atmosphere and location are prime.  This restaurant is in a cool area and has a good vibe.  But as an objective eater I must say that Le Thai sucks.    The first time my girlfriend and I ordered take out.  I ordered the Tom Kha and my girlfriend ordered the tri-curry.  You're going to slice up crappy ass button mushrooms and put it in my soup??  Seriously?  Is there even a Thai restaurant in town that tries to pull that crap?  My soup looked like a warm bowl of milk with some sliced packaged mushrooms from Albertson's.  And then am I supposed to think that it's spicey?  I ordered a spice level of 4 out of 5.  Next time I will order a 57.  I prefer when Thai restaurants are on the spicy side.  I dont want the waiter or chef to decide what they think I can handle and then end up giving me the equivalent of Ketchup.  The tri-curry was also about as good as a can of SpaghettiOs.    Since first impressions are not always the best, we tried it again tonight and decided to dine in.  We saw the server a total of once, when he took our order.  Luckily we saw the bus boy 3 times so that he could ask us to clear the table for him, to get a box and to get us the check.  Oh, and to take my credit card.  Horrible service with no explanation or apologies. The order was wrong too, I asked for a curry with NO onion and got a bowl full of them.  Maybe that is why the server literally never came back to see how our dinner was.    I cannot fathom why anybody who lives in Las Vegas would rate this Thai restaurant even mediocre with the amount of great or even good Thai restaurants all around us.  It's cool that we got a new ethnic restaurant downtown and all but shouldn't we want them to be good too?  A crappy restaurant is bad business for redevelopment.  I hope they improve soon.  ---------------------------  Since this review the owner contacted me directly to offer his genuine apologies and even offered to cook me a meal personally.  Although I politely declined I thought this was a very nice gesture that indicates that they are really trying to improve and make everybody happy.  You cant make everybody happy, but based on his reaction alone I would not discourage other people from giving it a try to see for themselves.",

I also loved the service. The waiters were accommodating and helpful - making sure we made our meeting promptly the first visit and offering me a FREE birthday shot on my second.  I truly adored the decor and clientele. It's an adorable place and a must-see any time in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "My office tried Le Thai the first week it opened and the food was so terrible to this day we call it Le Thai-arrhea.  The food has improved DRASTICALLY. It's not unique in any way, but it no longer leaves a residue on your teeth or looks like something drained from an infected camel hump as it did the first time I tried it.  Not counting that first week, nothing I've ever had at Le Thai was bad. From the spring rolls, to the curry to the fried rice, everything is perfect and it makes it very difficult to order. I am not a fan of Thai tea, but it is a favorite of almost everyone I know.  The food is great but the service and management needs major improvement.   For starters the restaurant is TINY. There is a full bar indoors and a few tables where they try to cram as many people as possible into a very small space. Reminds me of New York City and how so many places just cram diners together. The patio is about double the size as the indoor part. In the summer they use misters and for the cold desert winters they have heating lamps and other heating devices, but you still need a coat. They play good music but is way too loud. I want to eat and have conversation with my dining partners, and better yet, be able to hear my server.  There are not a lot of places to eat downtown that don't involve walking through a smoke-filled casino, so the wait at Le Thai is LONG. On a Friday night at 7pm, we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for a table. I heard the hostess tell the people behind us their wait would be two hours.  And here's the part that pisses me off. If you have to wait an hour or more Le Thai offers a free round of sake, or even a free bottle. If you have to sit outside in the cold weather, they offer free tea. But your server will never tell you that, nor is it posted in the restaurant. You have to show them you like their facebook page. I can understand if this was a facebook promotion to get more likes, but these freebies are essentially apologies to customers. Shouldn't EVERYONE who has to wait an hour or more or eat outside be allowed to enjoy some sake or tea, and not just their facebook friends? It builds rapport among customers who are social media savvy, but that's a very small set of clientele; not enough to keep your restaurant going.  Again, food is good, but it's always slow to come out. The server keeps your drinks filled, but slow to take empty dishes away and bring your check. Which is what probably adds to the ridiculous wait times. Their food is a little pricy, but I think their portions are very generous. Enough for two meals.  I go to Le Thai a lot (I work Downtown so about 1-2 times a month) and always send out of town guests there, but my experience last night was incredibly annoying. It included the manager telling our server to serve her table of friends before us (even though we were seated probably 10-20 minutes before them). And their response to my questioning why our server didn't tell us about the free tea and sake when we waited more than an hour and were seated outside was rude and obnoxious.   I probably will take a little Le Thai break. I did that when their food was disgusting and it improved. Hopefully the same will happen with their service and management.",

    "text": "When you emerge from the Beat's Tuesday Trivia Night with two vegan co-players and all of you are famished, Le Thai appears amidst the quiet downtown streets like a mirage in the desert, one that will do more than quench your thirst.  Smooth-sounding name, bi-environment seating with heaters outdoors, and a refreshingly short menu with many options to each dish - this joint is quite the little gem.  Almost every dish is offered to be cooked with tofu and brown rice.  Stir-fried noodles are served in bowls, a nice change to the visual palette.  Food quality is good and the amount is overflowing, with attentive service that won't hesitate to tell you when you've ordered a spice level you probably won't be able to handle.      Chicken Kra Pow is reliable but could be a bit too saucy.  Wings are yummy and definitely flavored with a signature fish-sauce taste, which adds to the addictive element.  My favorite is definitely the Awesome Noodles, like a love child between Pad See Ew and Pad Kee Mao, Awesome Noodles serves up smoky noodles stir-fried with a yummy amount of the underrated Asian vegetable-bean sprouts.  Le Thai, you're my favorite new downtown stop!",

So much so, that I think about it often, and come up with the lamest of excuses to justify going there.  Friends and family coming into town?  Oh, you're going here.  Friends IN town?  \"Say.... We haven't hung out in a while.  There's this new little Thai place that opened up downtown....\"  Just the other night, I hit the missus up to go.  Her: \"But we just went not that long ago.  Do you really want to go back now?\"  Me: \"Yes, because, uh, my shoes are brown, and that is to say... just get in the car, woman!\"  (This last scene will make for a lovely depiction in a teleplay I'm working on.  Words currently fail it.)  Regardless, since my initial visit, I've made it a point to sample more of their dishes, and while I am still horribly, HORRIBLY enraptured with their \"Awesome Noodles\", their other stuff is remarkable.  Even their specialty drinks are excellent (I've yet to try the one with the grape rum and lemonade, but that's next).  To date, nothing has dissatisfied me.  The wait time, the service, the food....  It's bad enough I'm in the area all the time.  I start getting the crazy-twitches just thinking about it.  As much as I love the neighboring Kabob Korner for their mighty gyros, Le Thai is now my new favorite Thai place.  That little strip of street is becoming dangerous for me as all I want to do is eat when I pass down that area.  Oh, who am I kidding?  I'll probably be back down there within a week, and Le Thai and I both know it.  Until that next time....",

I ordered level 3 out of five, being Mexican and used to spicy food I thought 3 would be perfect but when I got my tom yum soup It was so spicy I could hardly enjoy it. Their spice level chart is waay of, it should be 1to 3 instead of 1 to 5 my friend ordered a 4 for his meal and was as hot as mine, so here's a more accurate spiciness chart..... 1= medium 2= hot 3to5= fire! And although I did not enjoy my meal this time due to my taste buds being temporarily injured and not being able to really taste anything else past the chili, the fun atmosphere, the great service from my waiter/waitress, the awesome drinks, and the need to try other items on the menu guarantees a certain Le Return.  For now, Le Thai gets 3 stars which is actually 5 if you go by their chart.",

I ordered veggie pad Thai with no peanuts...I start eating, and I bite down into something crunchy. Peanuts! You couldn't really tell what they were at first because it was all crunched up and mixed in well with all the other ingredients. They switched it out with no prob. Luckily, I didn't have an allergic reaction. But the the 2nd pad Thai had veggies that seemed not so fresh-almost sour tasting. I ended up just not eating it. My friend ordered fried rice. Which was really good, until she found a long black hair in her food towards the end of the meal. Yuck. They took the dish away, (she was almost done anyway), took it off our bill, and offered to make more food for her to take to go. But by that time, considering both our dishes were messed up, we were just ready to go.   I don't think I will return for awhile :(",

I love that patio because it's covered, shady, and makes you feel like you're in a little oasis in the middle of downtown Vegas.  As I said, when you're used to going to places like Archie's Thai or Pan Asia, the sticker price here is a little, \"Ahhh!\" but it is very good Thai food.  My favorite dish is the Three Color Curry which mixes red, yellow, and green.  Have you ever thought, \"Man, I could really go for some red curry right now, but I want potatoes in it like yellow curry.\"  Well, Three Color Curry is the best of all three curry worlds.  The spice levels here are intense, so go low if you're not sure.  I've also had the pad thai and the ga pow (basil stir fry).  All of the food here is full of flavor and they offer the option of brown rice at no extra charge!  Side note, their cocktail menu is quite good, which I didn't expect at a Thai restaurant.  I especially enjoyed the Lady Boy and the one with champagne and St. Germaine (I can't remember the name of that one!).  The trick is to come for the lunch special, which is even honored on Saturdays!  You get an entree and a drink for only $9.95.  They also have a nice Happy Hour menu with apps and drink specials (again, EVEN ON SATURDAY!).",

Sometimes there is an azzload of tofu, other times it's an azzload of noodles. Sometimes when you order a spice level one it's not spicy at all, next time you order up a few levels and it's too spicy to eat.  Why do we come back? We are hungry and are too lazy to drive somewhere. It's easy to walk a few blocks when you are starving vs. driving somewhere. We have never had a bad experience nor a horrible meal.  My fav dishes are the vegan curry, the garlic rice and the Pad Kee Mao. Hubby always gets the Awesome Flat noodles. Last time he actually said when we left \"those noodles were not that awesome\". Ok!  For me to describe each dish would be ridic because it's just not that fabulous. Garlic rice is a joke compared to Komol blah blah.  The service is always prompt and very nice. All servers smile and in a place with super fast turnover, they seem to enjoy their jobs.   I haven't looked at the prices to compare them to other places. A lot of people say it's overpriced but that doesn't surprise me because it's a Downtown hotspot.  I'm sure we will continue to go back...when we are starving and want a level zero.

I recently decided to try the short rib fried rice which is also legit.  The only flaw this place has is that they do not take reservations but I over look that because it is that good. You will not go wrong, it is amazing!",

They told us we have to wait an hour, no big deal. Being the tourist that we are, we just walk around and they call you on your phone when your table is ready. Very friendly staff. You can't go wrong with any of the curry dishes. It all taste so good. Pretty authentic. This is actually one of our most satisfying meal in vegas. This is a must go whenever you are in Las Vegas",

I'm blaming my move to San Francisco for ruining thai restaurants for me. SF thai places have such interesting complex flavors that when you eat at a place like Le Thai you're sorely disappointed. Everything at Le Thai tasted like any other Thai restaurant.  The group shared: Pork Jerkey- yummy pork flavor, but the sticky rice was a dried out mess Beef app- Poor quality beef with a funky taste to it, also with super dried out sticky rice Spring rolls- deep fried, which of course makes them tasty Pad Thai- fine- tastes like Pad Thai anywhere else Awesome Noodle- pretty one note 3 color curry with shrimp- avoid shrimp here it tastes metallic and fishy Minced Chicken with basil- This was tasty Roti dessert- weird- egg, nutella and bread- surprisingly not a good combo.  Brown rice- a gelatinous mess- avoid this and eat the white rice  If you're worried about spice, two is pretty tame. Le Thai was a big thai food meh...",

However, the curry sauce was not complex, not nuanced.  Instead, I could basically only detect a chili or spicy taste.  It had a good taste, but the other. typically accompanying tastes weren't there.  Steamed white rice was good.  Eating outside was semi pleasant.  But the ordering through the fast food window, the plastic silverware in the wrapper and zero service all make it less than optimal as an eating experience.  Yes, the help asks for tips in the checks.  By the time we were finished, we spent 20 on a simple Thai dish that was a tad crude and a drink.  Given no service and ordinary food, awkward parking, etc.. I'd pass on this.  There are other Thai restaurants in town with better food and a much nicer ambiance.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place; I really did. But the slow service and so-so food really let me down.  We stopped in on a busy Saturday afternoon. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, and the hostess took our cell number and said she'd call when our table was ready. (This sounded like a great plan!) So we walked around the Fremont East area for awhile and then returned to the restaurant to have a drink at the bar.  We told the bartender we were still waiting for a table, and he told us the waitress would get us when our table was ready. Not sure what the disconnect was, but we sat at the bar for more than half an hour while people who came in off the street sat down to eat. (Yes, some of them came in after a phone call, but I watched others who just stepped up and immediately got a table.) I figured we were waiting for a table in the small dining area and not a table in the bar area, and that's why we were still waiting. But, no. When our table was ready, it was a table two feet away from us in the bar area. (Why we couldn't have just sat there initially, I don't know.)  We tried to order a bottle of wine while we were waiting, but they were out of our selection. So my husband got a beer and I had a water. When our table was finally ready, we had to cash out at the bar first, which was also kind of annoying. But I still had high hopes, because I had heard the food was great.  I love Thai food, and when I go to a new place, I always order shrimp pad thai to gauge it against other restaurants. This one was just so-so, although the portion was large enough that the $15 price tag was somewhat warranted. My husband fared better with his beef short rib fried rice, which I must admit was delicious (and I'm not a fan of short ribs). But it took a LONG time to get our food--as well as the beers that we ordered with it--and our waitress never came back to check on us, so we never got to order a second round of drinks like we had intended.  All in all, we spent $50 and an hour and a half for three beers and a mostly forgettable lunch. I hope other diners have a better experience than we did, because the menu showed promise (and the short rib fried rice was nearly worth the wait). But I think next time I'll drive the extra few miles to Lotus of Siam, where I know the food is always excellent, even if I have to wait.",

    "text": "I went to Le Thai on Fremont Street with two other people. We were trying to find a Thai place that used ingredients representative of Thai cuisine and heard about this place. The waiting wasn't that long. We were seated within 10 minutes. Once we received our food, customer service could have been more prompt. Someone didn't come to our table right away when we raised our hand even though some of the workers were standing around socializing. Even after we told someone about a plate that needed to be replaced because ice water had been spilled on it, it still took a few minutes to replace it. I would have expected a little more checking up on tables and being prompt. However, we enjoyed the food we ordered. My favorite was the Pad Thai!  We ordered Pad Thai with chicken, Red Curry with beef, spring rolls, and mango sticky rice for 3 people. The spice appears to be a little higher here because we ordered a 1 spice level for both the Pad Thai and Red Curry and it still had a little heat. It was, however, cooked well and we enjoyed it.   The Red Curry was creamy with green peppers and carrots. The bamboo shoots added a nice texture to the curry and the heat from the chilies was refreshing because it doesn't burn your throat. There was a good amount of the red curry broth that comes in the portion. The beef was tender.  The spring rolls had a nice crispness to the outside. I especially loved the red sauce that comes with the spring rolls. The mixture of sweet with a little spice from the chilies helped the spring rolls stand out from other ones I've had from other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.   The Pad Thai was really good here. The dish has an appealing color palette. The rice noodles were cooked well. It wasn't too greasy or mushy. The bean sprouts added a nice texture to the dish. The green onion tasted fresh and enhanced the flavor along with the carrots and cilantro.  The flavor savored in your mouth and there appeared to be a lot of fresh ingredients in this dish that smelled really good. The ingredients complemented and balanced each other well. This was probably my favorite dish of the ones I ate.",

I ordered the fried rice and was VERY disappointed as the menu said \"combination fried rice $11 add shrimp $13\" so I thought that meant chicken, pork, and shrimp so I ordered the $13 one. Nope. Just shrimp. No chicken or other meats. Maybe it was just me but I found that very misleading. The portion was about half of what an authentic Thai restaurant would give you. I ordered the spring rolls which were fine, but tasted exactly like Panda Express eggrolls.  I also got the Thai iced tea which was great but a little more expensive than other places.  I spent $27 on small portioned food. The flavor is good, nothing incredible, but I wouldn't come back. This spot is more \"trendy\" than authentic. Pass.",

We ordered the short ribs fried rice which was delicious.  So we ordered deep fried Cornish hen (what they had special at the time) mind you this is our Valentine's day dinner. The chicken or hen was okay. Something was off but it just didn't taste right, may be an old chicken. It was kinda sour. Their ginger sauce was really good though, the fish sauce kinda hide the sourness of the chicken lol  Also ordered pork jerky which was amazing. It comes with sticky rice and the water fall sauce. Best part of the dinner I would say.  Ok so as we were ordering I had no idea that the chicken comes with rice AND jerky comes with rice. I was telling her that I wanted steamed veggies because she offered that instead but I didn't know that it comes with rice so I said ok we'll take the sticky rice I guess.  We ordered 3 dishes and ALL have rice in it so I don't know why she didn't tell me about it because I would have ordered the steamed veggies instead.  I ordered a drink and of course she got the wrong drink. She was really friendly but there was a lot of miscommunication that night lol  If I had to judge the food in general, it was fine. Nothing special to be crazy over lol.  That's just me though. Hope that helped.   It's probably me having the worst luck. As always.",

I almost thought about ordering a steamed plain rice to mix with it. The flavor was in the right direction but it was just too much salt for my taste. The Thai iced tea was good and had the right portion of milk to tea.",

The short rib is the signature dish and is very good but give me the blend of red, green, and yellow curry every time in the 3color curry.  The curry was outstanding.

As of now this place is a overpriced, mediocre Tourist trap with awful Thai food and terrible customer service. You have been warned. Go look elsewhere, there are plenty of food places in that area that are worth your hard earned bucks.",

Just having dinner alone so had a seat  at the counter bar in the garden area towards the rear of the restaurant. It was a little cool that night so instead of my usual choice of chicken pad thai, I selected the beef and meatball soup with the chicken wings as an appetizer. The wings came out in about 10 minutes hot and crispy with a side of spicy siracha ranch dipping sauce. The wings were of average size and cooked to perfection. After the wings came a nice size bowl of soup. I chose to have the soup at a level 3 (hot) good choice not over the top spicy hot just the right amount of heat. There was lots of meat in the soup and the spices complimented each other great. After eating all the wings, I could not finish the soup but still ate until I was on the verge of miserable. Have to give this place a try if you want something you most likely don't have back home.",

I figured I shouldn't drink too much on an empty stomach, so I took the advice of some friends and went next door to Le Thai. The menu is small, only about 10 or 15 things on there. The service was nice, even though they we're starting to close.  I decided on the Drunken noodles with beef. The waitress asked me \"How Spicy? 1-5\". That caught me off guard, so I told her 4. She told that was extremely hot, so I said OK, make it a 3.5. She laughed.   The food took a few minutes, but it came out nice and hot. It wasn't that big of a bowl but it was just enough. For $11.95, I thought it would be bigger. The noodles we're kind of greasy though.  Anyways it was pretty spicy. After 3 bites I felt it. Half way through my lips and tongue we're on fire. I really like spicy, so this was good. But it was almost too spicy. Next time I'll try a 3.   The place is worth checking out. Next time I'm on fremont st. I may try something else. Wasn't overly impressed, wasn't dissapointed.",

We came during happy hour (3-6pm) and ordered all 4 appetizers off the menu.  First off, for the price  ($5-7 each plate), the portions are dinner size, which is a huge plus.  The wings were pretty good...loved the sriracha dipping sauce.    The waterfall beef was a tad underwhelming because it was just sauteed slices of beef, but the seasoning was spot on and the waterfall sauce was good.  The pork jerky was just as advertised...jerky.  Texture was good for what it was...same waterfall sauce as the beef.  If you're not a fan of jerky...don't order it.    Chicken satay lacked any seasoning.  Peanut sauce was standard.  We had read previous yelp reviews on the awesome noodles, and chose to order it to see what the hype was about.  But alas, our server forgot to put the order in and we canceled it because it never got started.  -1 star.    So far, pretty good considering the speed of service, friendly staff, quaint vibe, and tasty food.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in downtown Vegas.",

When I finally got around to going downtown for Le Thai, I was not disappointed. I gauge all my Thai food on the way they prepare their Pad Kee Mao and this place did such a good job, I don't get anything else!  The restaurant is really nice to eat at and the service is always really good. Now that I live downtown, we get it for take out and are always full and happy!",

    "text": "Food came out lightning quick...Old Downtown Las Vegas has been sprouting out cool little spots the last year or so, Le Thai is an addition that covers the late night eatery question when you are partied out.  I for one came in during lunch and tried the Waterfall Beef.  It can get pretty sporty during lunch, so beat the rush or get ready to put in some work to get a seat.  Anyweezy, I didn't want to try the same old stuff everyone orders (pad thai, panang, etc.) and decided to try something new.  The beef was cooked a little well for my taste, but was surprised how tender it was still.    The second time I rolled through, I got lucky with finding a seat at the counter outside...luckily it is cooling down in vegas, otherwise I would advise against it.  However, this time the food took forever to come out and this time I did get the panang at level 4 of 5 spice.  It took about 25 minutes for it to come out, so try to come before or after the rush.  Once it came out, I was not sure how accurate the spice level was, but after a few bites, I noticed that it was True to scale.  Level 4 is perfect for those that like it spicy, but still wants to retain feeling in your tongue following the meal.  Level 5 would probably be too much.  Mind you, I got some stones when it comes to heat, so my account may vary for some, remember, you can always add more peppers, but you can't take em out, so play it safe at first.   Interior design is hip and tailored for the downtown crowd.  It is sort of filling up with yuppies and business folk nearby, but the place is still new and in its infancy and may settle down with an established crowd identity later down the road.  Otherewise, not bad...not quite authentic Thai food, but seems to fool a lot of people and mixes it up with a diverse menu that could get beefed up a bit.  But its the only Thai place near work and makes it a very convenient eatery spot.",

I came with a group of six and had an hour and a half wait on a Wednesday evening (were seated just after 9) and we got on the list at 7:30.  The staff are friendly and service was good.  I shared the crab rangoon with my friends, it was a perfectly crispy outside shell and the creamcheese/crab inside was tasty.  Also ordered Thai Iced tea which was on point.  For my main I ordered the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with tofu at the level 3 spicy level.  I like spicy food personally but it cant be so hot you cant taste your food, 3 was less spicy than I'd hoped but still okay (which they describe as hot, beyond that is more intimidating words haha).  The noodles and sauce were good, maybe slightly on the sweeter side than i'd like and tofu perfectly cooked (not mushy like some places).  Overall a good experience and nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "So the name is French for \"the tie\" or something, right?  Le Thai is a well-established restaurant that has long anchored the bar and restaurant-laden part of Fremont Street east of the pedestrian and sidewalk entertainment-laden thoroughfare that is the icon if not the heart of Downtown Las Vegas. I'd never formally been invited to try this place out, and with all of the mixed reviews from Yelp friends, I wasn't actually looking forward to doing so anytime soon.  That changed when I had an opportunity to enjoy dinner with a cousin-in-law visiting from the other side of the country and some friends of his wife (i.e. my cousin). I believe it was the first time for all of us, and we were able to take on a sizable part of the menu by sharing our orders family-style.  I should note before dissecting the food that yes, we did have to wait on a Friday night; thankfully, the Yelp-linked waitlist feature let me throw in my name for our party of 4, and when my group checked in ahead of me, it did expedite our wait partially; we still had to wait 20+ additional minutes. However, we weren't in a hurry, and we got seated and served in a reasonable amount of time.  Also, I enjoyed the opportunity (though not the price) to order a draft beer thru a window while waiting outside. This allowed me to try something which I hadn't before: the Ballast Point Sour Wench ($7.50 for about 12 oz). It's a berry-ful, tart treat which helped to loosen my tongue and my palate up before starting dinner. I wish that the draft beer menu was a bit more visible or comprehended by the employee, but it is what it is.  Alright, food time. Somehow, the progression started out awesome and maybe tapered down to great, then good, then maybe not worth ordering.  Thai Pork Belly Bacon ($8): a new item or a special, and boy was it special. Perfectly melting fatty interior, crispy exterior, and a nice dipping sauce with fish sauce and some other ingredients.  Larb Salad ($10) w/ chicken, spicy level 1 (mild): came out at the same time as the pork belly, and tasted as good as the pork belly or even better. Lime juice was well-balanced, not overpowering. Lettuce wrap was fresh. I didn't even mind that it was ground chicken rather than ground pork. The amount of heat was appropriate or even a bit light for my palate.  Spicy Eggplant ($13) w/ shrimp (+$2), spicy level 3 (hot): my favorite of the entrees somehow. I really doubt that they actually added the indicated level of spice because I generally tolerated it. If the lighting were better in here, the colors would really pop in all of the eggplant and peppers and such. I'll just have to settle for really delicious and properly cooked. I was actually thinking of taking home leftovers until my cousin-in-law started abducting the eggplant at meal's end..  3 Color Curry ($12) w/ pork, spicy level 0 (none): yeah, kinda looks like one color. I think they mixed up the orders and actually gave this the spicy level 3. It was kinda rough at times. Still, the curry sauce is quite delicious, and it's awesome atop at the complimentary white rice. Plenty of veggies in this dish too.  Massaman Curry ($12) w/ beef, spicy level 0 (none): like a yellow, but with various additional spices and flavors. Beef was nice. Wasn't as impressed here for some reason as I was with the 3 Color Curry, and I really wish that the carrots weren't sliced into a puck-like shape; they were very difficult to scoop out of the bowl toward the end.  Pad See Ewe ($13) w/ chicken, spicy level 1 (mild): this is the dish which I'd definitely pass on next time. My cousin-in-law mentioned a sweetness, which I did observe. However, my more pressing observation was that the flavor was somehow drastically different than similar dishes served around town to the extent that I'm certain that they omitted a standard sauce in the cooking process. Also, the portion of Chinese broccoli within the dish was too small.  The music and atmosphere was not loud enough to distract from casual dinner conversation. I remember reading something about a lack of restrooms, but that's clearly outdated because there are two restrooms in the back of the main indoor seating area (which is right about where we ended up). The bar also seems to seat diners, but the street-side front patio doesn't.  Overall, Le Thai exceeded my expectations. It is not nearly \"the best\" but it has plenty of highlights. While I would balk at the prices compared to cheaper and arguably better Thai restaurants around town, I loved multiple dishes here. Perhaps I'll stop by again in the future after visiting bars or breweries in the area.",

I miss their glorious beef waterfall, the penang curry, the fried rice with bbq pork- every bit of it was just outstanding.  We eat a lot of Asian food and I've tried some of the best spots all over the United States.  This restaurant stands out as one of the top two Asian restaurants I've had the pleasure of trying.  The wait is going to be a bit long but it's worth it.  Hang around, as maybe you will get lucky like we did and be able to take the spot of a no show.  Our service was very good as well.  The server even brought us a small serving of coconut milk because the curry was a little bit spicier than I could handle.  I recommend going on the milder side and adding spice if you need it.  They're serious about their spices here so don't go crazy.  Make this restuarant a priority on your next visit to Vegas - you won't regret it.",

But why oh why only 3 stars? Well... I'm glad you asked! The service was really slow, and of all the food that we ordered, only the short rib fried rice stood out. The basil chicken was better than the average that you would get at your run of the mill Thai joint, but not amazing enough to justify the drive out to Fremont Street then to pay for parking and walk just to eat it. The larb was average and very watery, however they do give you full sheets of lettuce to eat with it, which I like. The waterfall beef was a little too salty, and kinda tasted like a failed Chinese pepper steak. And finally the spicy eggplant with tofu was good, but again it doesn't stand out for me enough to say it's better than any other Thai place with easy parking and no wait time.  The fried banana was good and crispy, and the condensed milk is a nice change from the caramel sauce that is so common.   In my opinion, lethai is good, but it's not so much better than other Thai places to go though the hassle just to access the place. If you find yourself here, order the short rib fried rice, I even got one to go.",

But couple days before I ate here I went to Siam Thai like 4 restaurants down from le Thai and man I got the same exact thing Red curry w/chicken from Siam Thai and SIAM blew Le Thai out the water!!! Siam is more authentic and they knew what they were cooking and everybody was Thai at Siam! Le Thai was all Mexican white people workers. You can't even compare the 2. The prices were about the same but SIAM gives you more in portions. DONT GO HERE. Go couple RESTUARANTS DOWN! You won't regret it. I feel like the location of Le Thai is prime cuz that's the first Thai restaurant you see. But pass that Siam Thai is way better and it's a bigger restaurants and no wait there. Telling you don't go to Le Thai. Gross vinegar red chicken curry are you serious ? Gross",

We knew the short rib fried rice was a must try, but we wanted noodles as well so we got the pad see ewe with pork as well as their fried chicken skin special.  The chicken skin came really quickly - I thought it would be all skin but there were some meat attached to it as well.  Nevertheless it was tasty and it was accompanied by what I assume was their waterfall sauce.  The pad see ewe came next and it was my favorite dish.  Noodles were well fried and chock full of meat and vegetables - it was a tad greasy for me though.  The ever so famous short rib fried rice had an unexpected kick to it but it was mild.  Also chock full of meat and delicious - also on the greasy side.  Next time I come I will ask if they can use less oil.  Service was great and prices was also very reasonable.  A must try!",

My personal favorite is the yellow curry, with a spice level of zero (because I'm a wimp! Lol). The flavor is amazing! I have been known to get it from Postmates since I work across town and sometimes get a craving. Subsequently I've managed to get some co workers hooked on it too. I'd love to try other items on the menu, however, I always want the curry. If I lived closer I'd probably be eating here all the time. If you're downtown and in the mood for the best curry in town, stop on by!",

We had dinner reservations and didn't really wait at all to get seated.  We went with whole family eight of us total.  We sampled a good variety of their fare.   We began the evening with appetizers a variety of chicken wings, the Thai ones were best.  The spring rolls were also very tasty, then chicken skewers with a delicious peanut dipping sauce and slaw.  My very favorite appetizer was the fried pork pieces with sticky rice, and a spicy light Thai sauce for dipping on the side.  It was absolutely delicious. Which I would have made that dish my dinner.  Unfortunately, was really not as thrilled with the dinner entrees.  My opinion seemed to be echoed by our entire table.  We all were very thrilled with our appetizer dinner was just so- so to us.  We sampled all typed of Pad Thais with a variety of different meats and condiments, yet most seemed unimpressive.  I personally had as my choice a beef stir-fry with vegetables and brown rice.  Just didn't seem to pack the same flavor on the entrees as my old time favorite Restaurant  Ping Kao on Rainbow and Lake Mead.  With eight of us there ordering a huge variety felt i was able to sample enough to gather an opinion.    Would I go back? Heck yes, the location is great, atmosphere super trendy,  and the service was o.k.  I would just stick to drinks and the appetizers more so.  Also if you don't like very loud music playing, you may want to pass.  I enjoy music but was so loud, hard to talk with our dinner party at times.    Marisol Juracka, Lv, Nv",

The restaurant was quite packed.. We decided to sit in the patio. They had the heaters going which was nice..  We ordered the following vegan dishes. The lady who was waiting us was very forthcoming and told us exactly which items were vegan and the new that were not..  1. Drunken noodles - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5 and it was a really tasty and flavorful. 2. Masamam curry - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5.. They had a lot of curry sauce and vegetables in the dish.. It was really flavorful and tasty as well,,   They served us  brown rice on request.   All in all a great experience! Will definitely go back to Le Thai restaurant again.   Ps: right around 10 pm the neighborhood bar starts playing loud music. If you are out in the patio, you will not to be able to hear anything else but the loud music.  Be prepared with ear plugs.. Alternatively, walk inside to the inside room if the music bothers you..",

The atmosphere, the food, the drinks - it's perfect for a work lunch or dinner on Friday night. I have yet to try anything I don't like. The sticky rice in the jerky was dry, but that's the only negative I can find. The heat is on a scale of 1-5. I usually get a 0 because I'm a baby, but I've tried all of my friends' various numbers. We've found the heat to be inconsistent based on the different cooks, so ask for the spice rack if you like things hot.  They open at 11:30, but I've noticed a \"soft opening\" earlier, around 11:15 or so. Make sure to get there RIGHT as they open, or any group bigger than two is going to have to wait a bit for a table. On 30 min lunch breaks, this is no bueno. You can make a reservation for dinner, but not for lunch.  The price is excellent and this is definitely not your average cheap thai place. This is SO GOOD!",

Ask them to add a fried egg on top which adds to the flavors. Love that they have a point system for spice 0 to 5 being the spiciest.

Not sure if you can order drinks there if you're not planning on dining at the restaurant, but I did see people picking up to-go orders. Ordered the Thai Pork Jerky appetizer--so good. The pork was a little crispy on the outside and the sauce was great. The beef Thai Style Fried Rice was also very good. The beer tasted like Korean BBQ meat.  I had to try the chicken Pad Thai as a good place to start. The level 3 spiciness has a nice little kick but I'm used to spicy foods. I recommend this place!",

I showed up and was met with a 90 minute & 9 people ahead of me wait. These were people that did not request a table before I did. I sat outside for 30 mins, then at the bar for another 30 mins while empty tables were just sitting. I've been a regular at this restaurant for years and it's really sad that the service here has actually gotten much worse, not better. You can see by my yelp profile that I do not make reviews often as I'm only here to browse them. Thats how upset I am at the service at this restaurant. Someone higher than management really needs to prevent loyal customers from reconsidering this place. And quickly.",

It'll give you an estimated wait time, awesome feature. We had to wait a little longer once we arrived, but picked up some $4 PBR cans from the bar window and enjoyed the brisk evening while we waited!  We shared an appetizer, short rib fried rice, panang curry, and a noodle dish - and everything was excellent. We polished off everything between four people, but definitely left full and happy. My cousins, who were staying in Vegas the whole week, actually went back that week because this place was so yummy.   Do your taste buds a favor and check this place out!

But fear not as there's plenty of other  options. I just took a chance on the wild card.   I went with your standard Pad Thai, but I saw some familiar Thai favorites sprinkled into the mix. The Pad Thai was exactly what you'd expect, and was done very well.   My companion ordered the Thom Yum soup and was gracious enough to let me try it. They do not mess around with the heat my friends. That thing was so spicy. But so tasty. The broth was excellent and all the veggies in it seemed fresh and perfectly cooked.   They also have a cute little outdoor section where you can order a drink at the window and chill on the sidewalk to watch the people go by. You can also order food here as well.

Tiny dining area, so we had to eat outside in jackets in a screened patio area with heaters( a small inconvenience). I eat Thai often(NY, NJ), but this was one of the best and even slightly unique. The Penang curry tasted like homemade- mild and creamy, and transparent flavors(no mystery sauces). Kee Mao was not sticky like other places but actually juicy and refreshing with all the veggies. I also had a salad, I think pork with lettuce and dressing...forgot the name, but was nice and lemony. However, they missed the soooo delicious peanuts. They should consider adding them for another layer of flavor and texture. Thai iced tea could have used less brewing or steeping time, it was a bit bitter. Thumbs up Le Thai! Oh, a little fun fact: all their menu sections are prefixed with Le. So it will say Le Beverage, Le other Beverage, Le Salad. I found it amusing and nice.",

Their curry is VERY SPICY- I normally get a 3-4 at other restaurants, but a 1 here is very hot.  Our server last time told me it's the curry base they use, it's hot!!  All of their curries are very good though- I've tried each type.  Overall, this place is not as good as Pin Kaow, which has bigger servings and is more \"comfort food\" style than this place.",

My favorite dish, however, is probably the spicy eggplant.  But, all of the noodle dishes are solid.   The enclosed outdoor area at the back of the restaurant is a fun place to sit and to bring visitors.  It's a small restaurant, so there's often a long wait, so plan accordingly.",

I was comparing it constantly to my favorite Thai place back home, and was a little bias to my homeland. They blew my Thai joint out of the water. The atmosphere is very cool. We sat \"outside\" in the back, which is basically a covered back alley with amazing artwork and cute lighting. It felt very trendy to me. But the best part was the food. They don't skimp on spice here... We had the Awesome Noodles with level 3 heat and they were almost spicy enough for my insatiable spicy appetite. I added just a touch of my own spice and was sweaty. Aside from the spice, the flavor is incredible. My only regret is that I did not try the Pad See Ewe. That's my favorite dish back home and now I'm 3000 miles away from Le Thai with no chance of tasting theirs any time soon.  Definitely will be back to Le Thai anytime we are remotely near Vegas!",

Price is a tiny bit more than most Thai places but I am happy to pay $10-13 for a plate of noodles when they are SO good!  Price is definitely on par with quality.  The staff is always nice.  The kitchen is happy to add ingredients (we added broccoli and it was only a buck or 2). The downside:  Service is like a roller-coaster one Saturday night our food actually arrived before our cocktails, and it turns out a normal poured crown-n-coke is $10, ouch!  A few days later, we waited more than 30 minutes for our lunch.  Admittedly, They were super-busy with a full lunch crowd, but they were equally busy that Saturday night.  While the kitchen is happy to add ingredients, they will not substitute noodles, which crushes my dream of having Drunken noodle toppings over the longer, stringy-type served with Pad Thai:( I am constantly unhappy with the lack of menu descriptions.  We always order the same thing because it is delicious and we have no real idea what the other dishes are.  It would be so simple to provide brief descriptions on the menu---there are only about 10 items. All this said and done, I still go back, at least once a week because the food is just Delicious!",

    "text": "Used to love this place but I dont think myself or the other 15 guests I was with will be going back.   We had a reservation for 10-15 people and were not told by the people we made the reservation anything about the potential of us being forced into a preset menu. We asked if we could split into two seperate parties to avoid complications as we weren't prepared for this and we were told no.   The manager came up to us as we waited for our table outside and asked us to pick out everything we wanted to order then (rather than at the table where we could discuss as a group with all of our guests) so it started out awkward from there.   We asked how much this would cost and we were told $25 per person. There was enough food brought out for everyone but only a few different options and we continually had to ask for more rice as only 3 (very) tiny containers of sticky rice were brought out for 15 dining guests and curry (that you put over rice) was the majority of what we had gotten.   The server told us that we were only able to seperate the check 4 ways but I have used that POS system and you can split it as many times as wanted. We didn't want the check to be difficult, we were willing to split even ways but having 15 guests for a birthday was really hard to narrow down to 4 different checks. Many of our guests walked across the street to the casino El Cortez to pull out cash as we were trying to not be \"that table.\"   When we received our bill it was over $650. We were charged an 18 percent included gratiuty (I am a 20% tipper but this is actually illegal now in Las Vegas and as a server I would not add my gratuity on such a large party that is already infuriated with me.) when we asked to be charged by individual plates rather than family style as they charged us a $400 family style charge that we were not aware of, they also increased the tip to 20%. I would never think that the server should get the short end of the stick in these situations but frankly he acted as if we were completely annoying for being concerned.",

My parents had been taking us out to eat pretty much all week so I thought it would be a great to take them out of their comfort zone and take them to dinner.  I also checked Yelp and read some of the positive reviews so I knew we were in for some good eating!  When we arrived, the hostess asked if we had reservations...oops...she took down my name and said it would be about an hour.  What we didn't know was that there was a patio in the back so the dining room may look small at first glance.  We only waited about 30 minutes and luckily sat inside cause it's really cold in Vegas during the holidays.  We ordered the staples: panang curry with chicken, pad thai with chicken...  Mom: Don't you want to try something other than chicken?  ...pad kee mow with tofu, and short rib fried rice (something we've never seen)  We also ordered spring rolls to start which were pretty standard and served with a sweet chili pepper sauce.  Each dish was delicious!  But it was the fried rice that really stood out!  Now we had wished we tried this place earlier!  However, as with each trip, it's great to end a trip with an amazing meal.  I tried coconut water for the first time and it was pretty good.    The place was full so it did take a little while for our food to arrive.  I credit that to the two tables that sat ahead of us and a string of take-out orders.  But we weren't in a hurry...and family meals are meant to be enjoyed.  It's a very cool and hip restaurant and everyone was very friendly.  We were also able to see the cooks in the kitchen through a large window.  My parents wondered how old the building was since it is located on east Fremont Street.  It can feel a little sketchy at first, but it's pretty safe since the El Cortez is kitty corner to it.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.",

We were quickly seated and our waiter took our drink order. My fiance and I both ordered Ga Pow, I got shrimp and he got ground chicken. Maybe it's because I eat a lot of Americanized food, but I wasn't expecting it to come out so...wet. There was liquid at the bottom of the dish that I normally don't seem to get when I order stir fry. Again, that could be because I don't normally Thai food. Even disregarding that though, the ground chicken my fiance had was not very good. After all the hype, I really expected something fantastic and I didn't seem to find that in either of our dishes or the egg rolls we ordered as an appetizer. I might be willing to give it another chance, but only if I happen to be in the area. I won't go out of my way to go downtown to eat it.",

I was shepherded here by Nate M, the local Vegas CM, and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I sampled a few dishes and was impressed by all of them. They don't hold back on the spice level, the service is solid, the venue is cozy and vibrant, and the gin n' tonics are plenty strong. The menu does have a few interesting dishes I don't often see at your run-of-the-mill joints. And to top it all off, there's a Yelp check-in offer for a free hug.   I saved my hug for the next visit.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this place forever! I love Thai food and the downtown vibe. I thought going in that this place would be worthy of a a 5 star review, but the lack of service killed the experience completely.  It was a Thursday night around 7pm. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and given menus. Joel and I decided we would share our dishes since we wanted to try the same things. We waited probably 15 minutes and no one had come by. No drink order, nothing. The waiter and waitress continued to walk right by us and not even look at us. Finally when the waiter walked by I asked him if we could order. He said \" our waitress was really busy that's why she hadn't come by, but that he would take our order.\" I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice with an egg on top at a level 3. Joel ordered his favorite, Pad See Ew with pork at a level 2. The food took a lot longer then expected. I was hungry and wished we'd ordered an appetizer. I started noticing other tables that had come in after us getting their food. Weird. Finally out came our order! Mine was very tasty. It had chunks of short rib and the spice level was perfect. Next time I wouldn't spend the extra $1.50 for the egg on top. I was expecting it to be runny so I could mix it into the rice, but that egg was hard as a rock and did nothing for the dish. Joel's Pad See Ew was more broccoli then noodles, but still had a great flavor.   The decor is very minimum, but they do need to kick the heat lamps down a bit. We were sweating up a storm and not just from the spicy food. I had high hopes for Le Thai, but with that service I'll spend my money somewhere else downtown. Sorry Le Thai you lost me.",

I thought the menu had a lot of options for vegans as well as carnivores.   My favorite things here are the drunken noodle and chicken satay. Both delicious, drunken noodles with spices and soy sauce, melt in your mouth chicken cut up really small, peanut sauce tastes homemade as well. Curry is also nicely done. It comes with rice and in three different flavors with your choice of meat. I have been here multiple times and never experienced bad service or bad food.   I would recommend this more for locals or people looking for a local experience in Vegas. No tourists here.",

    "text": "Man, I can't believe with all the rave I've been hearing about this place, I haven't been here before.  A friend and I came to Le Thai after working in our downtown location for a few hours.  We knew that we had a long night ahead and needed some food in our stomach. Working for Zappos, I was recommended to come here by my CEO and I didn't want to pass the opportunity to do so since we were working next door.    At first, you think the place is super small.  The inside consists of a few small tables and a bar area.  Then they take you outside and there are a lot more tables with heaters.  I loved the white xmas lights that set the mood for the dinner experience.  The bathrooms smelled really good and looked like a completely renovated bathroom you would see in a modern house.    For dinner, I got the Chicken Pad Thai for $11.50.  My spice level was 2 (remember that they go off a 1-5 scale and not the usual 1-10 heat scale).  The pad Thai was AH-MAZE-ING!  They got served in a big bowl.  The rice noodles weren't as thick as I'm used to and I loved it!  There was a lot of chicken in this dish and the peanuts really enhanced the overall texture.  I must say, this is probably one of the top 5 best Pad Thais that I've experienced here in Vegas.  I certainly think the kind of hefty price is totally worth it.    Definitely must come in and try the Pad Thai.  You'll thank me later :-)",

I Received a bowl of well-seasoned and slightly spicy peanuts for a comp appetizer at the bar. Tasty!  Spring rolls were cooked well, not too greasy, but not much flavor either. Sauce could have had more punch as well.  Drunken Noodles were a disappointment, unfortunately. This is my test dish for all Thai restaurants because it says a lot about seasoning, technique, preparation, and overall flavor. I had them with Pork (first time), on recommendation from my waiter. The meat was too plentiful and ground, so it was overpowering, the noodles too few, so the dish had no balance, there was no egg at all (why?) and the basil was flat and not flavorful at all. I asked for medium spicy and I couldn't taste the hot at all.  So, overall a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't be a regular. You guys can do better, I'm sure!",

    "text": "This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This is not your traditional Thai restaurant but it is more of a fusion style with really good flavor and selections.  The place is small and at the end of the Fremont Street experience.  Parking can be found along the streets with a garage about one block away.  They also have an outdoor seating area with a to go Window.  Tables and chairs are fairly basic and rattan looking.  The background music is your typical lounge easy listening sound.  It's eclectic and goes well with setting the mood. Reservations are a must as this place gets really busy during the dinner time rush hour.    The drink menu has some very interesting concoctions as well as a unique beer selection.  My wife loved the Peachtini and Thaijito. I ordered the Thai Iced tea but it was really on the sweet side.    Food is the reason you go here.  For appetizers, the must haves are pork jerky and waterfall beef.  For mains, short rib fried rice and the Currys are great choices. Every order comes with either steamed rice or sticky rice so keep that in mind when ordering.  Finish off the meal with Roti dessert which is like a crepe pizza made with Nutella and egg.  It sounds strange but it tastes delicious.  One order is enough to share for two.",

    "text": "Located on the busy streets of Downtown, Le Thai sits as a hidden gem. I had heard very good things about Le Thai from a few people, but never had the chance to try it. After watching countless videos about traveling to Thailand, I found myself craving the spicy, flavor filled dishes that Thai cuisine has to offer. Since I was Downtown, I decided it was finally time to make my journey to Le Thai.   Le Thai has quite a few classic and much loved Thai dishes to choose from, but these two are my favorite:  Pork Jerky: The pork jerky is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. If you've never had this dish before, you take a small portion of the sticky rice and wrap it around a piece of jerky. After that, take the jerky/sticky rice combo and dip it in the waterfall sauce!The waterfall sauce is some of the best I've tried here in Vegas. It's super flavorful and really gives the jerky that punch of added flavor.   Chicken Fried Rice: People have different opinions about the fried rice here at Le Thai, but when I tried it for the first time I proclaimed to my friends that it was the best fried rice I had ever tasted. There is so much flavor in Le Thai's chicken fried rice, you just have to try it to see what i mean.  Try these two dishes and I promise you won't be disappointed! Here are a couple quick tips:  - Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 3-6pm & Saturday from 11 am - 4 pm. They have a lot of appetizers to choose from and drinks as well.  - They have spice level options for their dishes. It ranges from 0 (no spicy) - 5 (bring the heat!)  Next time you're craving Thai food, you know where to go.",

Located right on Fremont St in Downtown Las Vegas.  The table was dirty but hey, it was lunch time and they seemed pretty buisy.  I ordered the yellow curry with chicken over steamed rice.  It was A-Mazing!!  I savoured each and every bite I took.  The curry managed to stain my tongue ring a strange shade of yellow and then green.

    "text": "I like having a consistent Thai spot less then a mile away from me.  I was hesitant to order take out from here originally because I didn't know how difficult it would be to park. But there's a 10 min parking area right across the street.   I ordered what I normally order when I first try out a Thai restaurant which is the yellow curry. I also ordered the ga pow with sliced chicken. I wasn't a fan of the curry but I thoroughly enjoyed the ga pow with sliced chicken. Unlike other Thai restaurants the chicken here is pretty moist. The fried egg on top of the dish took it to another level and the richness of the egg yolk helped enhance all of the surrounding flavors.",

    "text": "Le Thai is pretty decent, don't get me wrong. I live near Fremont, and it's a convenient place to grab some decent Thai food. Typically, I'd stop by once a week to grab some of their curry (which is pretty mild). The place is a bit crowded during peak hours, but usually isn't too bad.   However, lately I've been really busy so I've been ordering it for pick up -- a normal thing for a Thai place. And their absolutely poor service in this aspect has completely lost me as a long time and frequent customer. The first time I was on hold for 20 whole minutes, with someone picking up occassionally, asking what I needed, then after telling them it's carry out, they'd say \"One moment\" while they try to grab someone. Now, I get that it's busy and they can't always take an order right away, but 20 whole minutes?  Thankfully, the manager gave me a free meal, but I rather have just paid for it if I could get my order.   The second time, the same thing happens. After fifteen minutes on hold, I just hang up. Whatever,  this time it was peak hours, I'll just go down the street to Lotus of Siam who I never had a problem with.  Finally, I try to order a third time on another day. And I get the same treatment. But this wasn't during any crazy peak hours, so they don't have much of an excuse. Fifteen minutes on hold listening to the most annoying hold music ever (8bit, high pitched melodies), I just hung up again.  There food is decent considering the location. However, just out of principle, I'll never be returning. The amount of time I have to wait on hold with them, is the amount of time it takes round trip to pick it up elsewhere.",

The pad see ew had the best flavor but everything was pretty average. It didn't taste very authentic and none of the dishes were very spicy either. We also used the yelp deal for the bogo Thai tea but it tasted watered down. Probably won't come here again as it was pricey for the portions they give.",

A busser came and, without making eye contact, swept my plate away before I could say anything.  At this point, I just turned around and handed a twenty to the bartender.  She seemed confused and asked what was wrong but I was done at that point.  The only reason I paid anything at all was to avoid the appearance of a dine-n-dash in downtown Las Vegas.  Fortunately, the festivities of Fremont street cheered me back up.  I ate a block away at a famous slider restaurant just for sustenance.",

This is a go-to dish for me anytime I visit a restaurant that has it so I know what I want when I place this order. The sauce had a fuller flavor than most I've tried with some sweetness coming through and the heat was perfect. I ordered a 2 out of 5 and added a little extra from the spice rack.  My companion ordered the short rib fried rice on the server's recommendation and it was phenomenal! If you're trying to decide what to order, stop. Close the menu and order the short rib fried rice. As long as you can handle a little mild heat, you will not be disappointed. We will definitely go again the next time we're in Vegas.",

Its pretty small but they do have a covered patio with plenty of seats for large parties and heating lamps.   Check: They do accept cards. For four people I spend 80 dollars.

This dish for me is packed with flavors and texture. I'm also a person that loves eggplant but cannot cook it for the life of me, but they have it covered! The three color curry is still top of my list next to the massaman curry with both beef and tofu. Their curries have great consistency when it comes to flavor...some places deliver sweet one day, then sour the next, not here you get what you order... every time you order it! Last but not least their chicken tom kha is second to none! If your ever sick with a cold, flu, broken bones... this soup has healing powers!   Enjoy!",

My friend Ms. J was absolutely crazy about the sauce and kept what was left over to eat with her Entree.   For my Entree I tried the yellow curry at the lowest spice level possible. I ordered it with beef and asked for an extra order of pork, too. This definitely made the portion large enough that I took half home to my husband!

Found this place on yelp & decided to try it out.This place was super cute smaller but very comfortable vibe. Our server Katia was the sweetest had a lot of knowledge on the food and answered any questions she checked on us & was giving us the best service. Even when she had to go on a quick break other employees checked on us and filled our water. Our food was a 10/10. Very flavorfull. There was a wait but they text you when your table is ready super convenient and we were able to walk around freemont while we waited.",

    "text": "Le Thai has been on my list of places to try for a while now. It's is a very popular dining spot on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas and often has a line of people outside waiting for a table.  I finally decided to give it a go for happy hour and got there just a little after 5pm - which seemed to be a good time to go because even though the restaurant was busy, I didn't have to wait for a table.   Le Thai's space is pretty small. I don't know if there were more than 20 tables but it was clean and had a nice, busy vibe.   Their happy hour offerings are pretty good: chicken satay, pork jerky, waterfall beef, Thai chicken wings, beer, liquor, and wine. All at a discounted price!  Our server was good. He brought out waters right away and said hello. He didn't rush us to order, and overall he was friendly - although on the more quiet side (which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I love to chat with servers to find out what they like to eat and to get a feel for their enthusiasm for the restaurant).  I ordered Thai iced coffee to drink. It was very strong - much stronger than the ones I have had at other Thai spots - and not as sweet.  I ordered 3 appetizers - chicken satay, chicken wings, and waterfall beef. The chicken satay was my favorite. It was tender and most flavorful between the 3. The waterfall beef was good but aside from soy sauce, it didn't have a distinct flavor. Same with the wings.  I also ordered pad Thai and garlic fried rice. Both were good. I think that the rice was better than the Pad Thai. The pad Thai was a light on the gravy - I just prefer it to have more.   Overall, I had a pretty good meal - I probably wouldn't stand in line to get a table but I'll definitely go back to try some of their signature dishes like the short rib fried rice and my favorite Thai dishes: panang curry and  spicy basil.  3.5 Stars for me.",

I've been here a few times now and on my most recent visit I had the lunch portion yellow curry with tofu. They don't play when it comes to spice so if you can handle it go for a 4 otherwise 2-3 is spicy enough. The food is always super flavorful & fresh. I like the unique taste their curry has. A bit more soul then the normal local spots.   If you're in downtown give them a visit for sure or take a local date night out. You will not be disappointed!",

Le Thai gives you authentic Thai flavors with the downtown Artsy feel ..  Mara was my waitress today and of the lunch specials I had a hard time picking so I let her pick for me and I was in Heaven..   I've never had a bad dish from here .. only concern is that the damn wait can be super long to get a seat since it's a tiny spot so I suggest getting on their virtual waitlist via Yelp...  On a prior visit I have enjoyed tons of different items my fav is the spare rib fried rice..  Thanks tons to the staff especially Mara for making my lunch break awesome and having large enough portions I could eat it for dinner too",

So if you like spicy food, I would recommend going for spice level 4.5 or 5 here. Overall the experience was good. I wouldn't mind going there again.",

Wait time for food was about average. I did ask if the food could be spicy level 3 out of 5. The food was TASH! What a waste! Barely had any crab meat, way to many onions in the order, and the spice level was WEAK! $15 for nothing. It's hard to believe that this is the second time the restaurant had to renovate, and change the menu. Was it worst before? Don't understand the hype about the place. One and done at this location. Best and only part of the restaurant was the music. Cool I guess .  Overall: 3/10  Red",

If your downtown and are looking for a ramen/noodle house this is the place to go. $10-$15 per person is way cheaper than the strip and better quality. What more do you want? Add some nigiri sake and you got yourself a meal: who knows where it leads!",

Suggested the short rib fried rice to us and two of the three of us tried it and fell in love with it.  Our friend tried, tried the wide noodles, and it was his first time. He didn't like spicy but loved the wide noodles dish.  Definitely coming back here to eat. And I suggest you do too.",

On this particular visit I ordered the daily special, BBQ pork fried rice - spicy 3/5. I personally thought that this was not spicy but the heat that was there provided a nice and smokey flavor.   I felt like experimenting so I poured some of the yellow curry from another persons dish onto my fried rice, and DAMN that curry is good! There's also a small beer garden where that has a window to the bar. It's good for grabbing a drink or two while your wait to be seated.",

Love the comradery of the staff.  Everyone seems to get along great.  We sat at the bar near the window, so you can chat it up with \"Prince\" our bartender and people watch outside.  First, GREAT pours at this bar.  Really \"healthy\" if you know what I mean ;)  I had the chicken pad thai - spicy levels run 1-5 - I got a 2 and it had a good kick, it was considered medium - don't think I could handle the 3.  My hubs got the beef pad thai - 3.  Both were good but we've had better.  Great portions, served hot - noodles were good.  We love all these great new places off of Fremont Street and this place jams.  I will say the drinks were a bit pricey - kind of like Strip prices?  I was only drinking vodka and club soda and was charged $10 a drink.  I try to justify it as you are paying for a great experience and fun night too, but think they should take a simple drink like that down to $8.  Too pricey for Fremont, guys!  Gear it towards locals!",

I get turned off by the commercialization of the cuisine from few over zealous, who are social chefs and part time chefs/owners. To attract the mainstream food lovers who have a sweet tooth, they add palm sugar to every dish to make it blander for the palate. This is akin to putting raisins in an Indian delicacy called Biryani. This practice should be outlawed and the violators put away in some kind of Culinary Prison !  Few of the Thai places in this town are overrated by the same crowd who seem to think that Taco Bell has the best Mexican food and Olive Garden has the best Italian food. Now, palm sugar is not only too much sugar but it is from the palm trees and neither the sugar or the oil is healthy since it has the most saturated fat of all oils. But it is cheap which explains the overuse.   Authentic food is in the palate of the beholder and not reading reviews or five start ratings. Some chefs have the touch and other don't . This place is small but the food is very authentic and simple. The Pad Thai is delectable just the right amount of spice and crispiness. The location is not the best with problem of parking and safety specially after dark.. I only go during the day time since the location is not the safest after dark. The food is not fusion Thai or some variance,  that is now prevalent in Urban areas to appeal to the Teenyboppers who really have no clue about what the original food tasted like.. Suffice to say this is the  Best Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas.",

Because out of the 8 times I have been here every single time my food is different...different portion size, food has flavor or no flavor,spice level (even though I always do a 2), cleanliness factor, either horrible or great service, and my spiked thai tea is always either WAY to strong (not that that is a bad thing) or weak as s&%t! There is NO consistency here. Oh, and watch out on the spice level. I'm half korean and a 2 is a challenge! My son ordered a 5 once and couldn't even eat it! Again, I feel like there is never consistency.

The awesome noodles were perfect but the pad Thai was so spicy it had to been a level 5 there was such a difference between the two. I couldn't even touch the pad Thai without crying. We brought this to the servers attention and he never said sorry or attempted to remake our order or anything. He dropped the bill off and we payed. As we were walking out I noticed one of the owners outside and told her about how disappointed we were in how they reacted to our problem aNd her response was \"I'm not he owner just a manger\" **lies... But anyway she continued to say \"we don't remake orders\" I'm sorry you screwed up our order and what? She then continues to say and \"sorry the server is new\". Ok I don't care if you are new or short staff I am a paying customer and if you f up please attempt to fix the situation not make excuses. Will not be dinning here again. Bad \"managers\" and wait staff. If you want real Thai food go to lotus of Siam thanks :)",

    "text": "First of all the service is TERRIBLE when the owner tries to square up with you in the front of the restaurant like a high schooler! Lets just get that out of the way first and foremost before I tell the rest of my story here.      I went to Le Thai this past weekend with some friends after attending a function at the Hilton we were heading downtown to watch a friends band perform. The suggestion to go to Le Thai was equal parts mine and a friend who also wrote a review. I was excited because I had the food there once before and enjoyed it! While waiting in line for a place to sit I noticed that a man was sitting at basically the only table in the tiny restaurant wearing a Le Thai shirt and wearing a rolled up towel around his head like all of the chefs were. He was sitting chilling with the only table having drinks and laughing and having a great time with obviously was his friends. The sign at the front of the door said please wait to be seated so me and my group of 10 people did just that. Waited...........and waited some more........then after about 20 minutes of waiting i asked the waitress what was going on and asked her if we could just sit in the back patio area where visibly there were several open tables.      After another 10 minutes she started pushing them together. By now there was a line out the door of people trying to pay to eat this food. And the same guy was sitting down hanging out with friends, understandably so I was upset and started to say something to my friends in the group. Obviously he heard some of the things I was saying and came up to me asking if I had a problem. I informed him that I thought the service was not so good and said ,\"now that were finally getting some tables pushed together I think we will be OK, go back to having lots of fun.\" He did not like that because he then said if your going to bitch then just leave. I did not like that, I know what good service is and asked to speak with a manager, (here is the fun part) He said he was the OWNER! I was furious I went on to say that the service was terrible and he had no place as a business owner if that's the way he conducted himself!       He then repeated get the F out. So I let him know, \"Your damn right I will I'll take my group of 10 people that were going to pay to eat your food somewhere else. Thanks for nothing!\" Now I'm a big man and when we left he was brave enough to get in my face in the street in front of all the people downtown and proceed to square up with me, luckily the cops were right there and the Le Thai bartender and waiters and staff and friends of mine were there to help diffuse the situation. THIS IS NOT HOW BUSINESSES SHOULD BE RUN. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO DELIVER GREAT SERVICE AND I WAS SICKENED BY HIS ACTIONS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM ESCALATE LIKE THAT! I am not the most popular guy in las Vegas or anything like that but I know a lot of people and will tell everyone to never support this establishment and you would all be wise to follow my advise unless you risk being sucker punched while eating shrimp pad Thai!",

All I can say is absolutely delicious! I was out in Vegas for the weekend from California and my husband and I were just amazed at the food here. My husband also ordered a Thai soup which was to die for. I wish I could remember the name but I don't :( The place is very small but the decor and ambiance is so cute! It's cozy and modern! Not only is the food amazing but so is the staff! We were seated at the bar because we didn't want to wait and I'm so glad we did! Ashley (I think that's her name)..the bartender was phenomenal! She gave outstanding service! Very polite, friendly and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our lunch! Thank you Ashley & Le Thai for being amazing! This will be my first stop next time I'm in Vegas! And I'm definitely recommending this place to my friends and family!!!",

We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \"very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \"Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh. What's really bad about it is we're locals so when the tourists aren't there who does she think Le Thai is serving?",

We made a reservation for a group of 15. We were hoping to go at 7 but they asked us to come at 6:30. Fine, we did.  When we for there they were not prepared for our group. We pulled the tables and chairs ourselves. Then after all 13 of us had ordered, the manager came over and said they only had 2 woks going in the kitchen and could we combine orders. We then took our order down to 10 orders. We of course ended up adding more dishes. The manager spent the rest of our stay glaring in our direction. Then the bill came...wow. They put extra food on our bill. When we told them about it, she was condescending and made it sound as if we were lying and then as if she would punish the kitchen for sending us food we didn't order or eat. We paid, making sure we counted out every cent of the money to her so there would be no confusion. We walked out of there and straight into a bar at the container park to wash the taste of this horrible customer service off our palates. Some of our party had been here before and spoke of how great it was...sadly none of us plan on returning.",

Their spicy scale goes from1-5.  We ordered the soup 3 and the rice 2.  The rice was very tasty and had a bit of a kick to it.  The soup was delicious!  Level 3 spicy was enough to have us reaching for the iced tea quite a few times until we got used to it.

If it wasn't in the location it is - I don't think people would be so keen on the reviews or continue to patronize it repeatedly. The location and vibe is great - but it's the organic vibe of the place that makes it - not the staff that creates it. The wait staff is not the friendliest or personable and management - whoa sister better not let the success go to her head.",

Cute place but super small and if you have someone under 21 in your party you will have to sit outside on their back patio. But they have these huge misters back there so it's ok. Had the Pad Prik and the chicken pad Thai and both were really really good. Will come back to this little Thai place on Fremont street!",

I ordered the spring rolls, awesome shrimp noodles and curry chicken.  The curry chicken was great; very flavorful and saucy.  I got it medium spicy because some of the other reviewers said it was really hot but it wasn't.  I could've actually went with spicy hot.  The awesome noodles which are overpriced at $10 was a disappointment because of the bean sprouts.  I'm not really a fan of bean sprouts and there were just too many but the noodles were good.   Surprisingly there was a lot of shrimp and they were cooked just right.  Spring rolls were good also.",

We were never asked how the food was, my son was never asked if he wanted a refill. On top of that terrible service, they tried to add 18% on our bill on a table of 3. They really need to train the servers better. I traveled all over the world and I think this is the worst service I ever had. Food was great but can't recommend that place because of staff.",

The sauce that comes with it is hot with some sour cream tang (siracha mixed with sour cream and mint perhaps?...). The drunken noodle everyone raves about is definetly tasty and hits the spot. The chicken satay is not worth it- too dry. Although, the size of the satay is huge! Like whole chicken breast huge. It is a little off from the tourist area and there seems to be a lot of locals who hang out here. I would recommend this place if you are in the area as this is a good break from the crowd.",

Everytime I've been there the food have always been so yummy.  The only thing that is negative is it's always busy and a wait is unavoidable, but once you do get seated everything is all good.  The menu is simple but simple is good.  Definitely a place to visit rather you are a local or tourist!",

I had the chance to try three different dishes here and none disappointed.   The sweet/savory interplay that is the Awesome Noodles (and they live up to the name) or the lip-smacking goodness of the Braised Short Rib Fried Rice (even the long name won't derail your enjoyment of this dish-my favorite-) Its all good in this joint that is frequented by both tourists and locals.   Also of special mention is the Pork Jerky appetizer. A plate of fried pork goodness served with a sauce that is everything thai food should be. Mix both in the side of white rice and you might be tempted to forgo an entree and have two servings of this dish.   Whether you're a local looking for a place to add to you favorites list or a tourist looking for a True taste of Las Vegas, Le Thai should not be missed.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I had been dying to try this place out for a while now because I've read so many great things about it.  Instead of going to First Friday, my friend and I decided to beat the crowd and head to Fremont Street a little early and get some drinks.  To my pleasant surprise, Le Thai was not very busy at all.    The restaurant is quite small with about 4-5 tables inside and a bar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the actual bar that seats about 8.  It also has a back patio that has tables, as well as a front patio section.  It's cute inside, but it was warm.  Granted, it was about 110 outside, the AC was probably having a hard time keeping up.  Anyway, our server was nice but not very attentive.  We placed our food order and told him we'd order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.  He never came back to get our drink order so we asked the SA who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for us.  Also, they dropped off food but never gave us untensils, so we also asked the server when he came to get our drink order.  We ordered the waterfall beef, which comes with a side of sticky rice.  Holy YUMMO!  This dish is out of this world.  I could just eat this all day long.  It totally reminds me of food my mom used to make for us growing up.  SO EFFIN BOMB.  It's basically sauteed beef drenched in this lime/fish sauce.  The sauce wasn't very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.  I, however, LOVED it and was drenching my sticky rice with it.    We also ordered some Pad Thai to share. On a scale of 1-5 spicy level, I ordered a 2 and it was dang spicy!  Even my friend, who loves spicy, agreed that it was quite spicy.  Despite that, it was freakin' delicious.  It's some of the best pad thai I've ever had.    The food here is off the chain.  I want to go back and try EVERYHING on the menu!  They have larb and I wanna see how authentic it tastes, coming from a family where my mom grew up in Thailand and cooked Thai-style food my entire childhood.  The prices were reasonable as well.",

We both got the Awesome Noodle with tofu on our first visit and it was exactly as the name states: awesome! On our second visit, I tried the Panang Curry.

However, now I am not sure when I'll be able to even get take-out again!  We've ordered carry-out a few times and have always enjoyed the food, but recently we tried to order and were told that they were not accepting carry-out orders because they were \"backed up.\"  This unreliability really bugs me and makes me much less likely to plan on ordering from them again in the future. I would have accepted a longer wait time for food or whatever, but I've never heard of a restaurant just shutting down take-out without warning because they happen to be busy! It makes no sense.  As far as food goes, the ga pow is tasty with a very nice basil flavor, their tom yum soup is good and perfect for when you're not feeling good if you can get them to make it spicy enough, and I really like the ginger fried rice- when I am actually allowed to order it, that is.",

I'm a sucker for good Thai food, so when she said it was authentic, needless to say I was beyond psyched and couldn't wait to go to sleep to have lunch here the following day. We arrived and had to wait a few minutes before our table was ready. No biggie, we took the time to take pictures of course! Our table was ready and we sat outside - I now understood what \"authentic\" really meant - it was a blazing hot day and we sat in the back with fans blowing - I could totally picture myself in Thailand in the same atmosphere! We ordered a bunch of dishes to try: chicken pad Thai, yellow curry, green curry and some appetizers - this is where the authentic comes in! The food was so rich and flavorful! We were so full, but couldn't stop eating! Shame on me, but I never had the sticky rice with mango, so as stuffed as we all were, we shared an order! The rice was cooked perfectly, the mango was sweet and the combination of the two truly works! When I'm back for my yearly visit to Sin City to visit the BFF, I will, without a doubt, be making sure this is on the list! The wait is worth every second!",

Walking in, I was met with a cozy atmosphere, a great soundtrack and seriously some of the best smells my nose has ever encountered. My nose might as well have jumped off my face and made a permanent home here, it was that great.  So after I had one of the most intense smellgasms of my life, I was seated and ordered up one of my favorite delicacies, dragon pearl tea. The tea was delivered with a kettle of hot water and nice little glass. I let it steep and looked over the menu. The prices can be a bit intimidating, but let me reassure you, you're getting what you pay for. I went ahead and ordered a stir fry and went on enjoying my tea.  The food blew me away, it was seriously not what I expected. The spice complimented the flavors so well and the tea worked perfectly with the dish. I couldn't be happier and before I knew it, the bowl was empty and my buddy Aaron was staring at me in disbelief as I MURDERED that meal. Seriously, I had to call the stir fry family and tell them the bad news.  Go to Le Thai, order as much as you can. Tell them Ryan sent you and they'll look at you confused because they don't know who I am.",

It would be better to add some spice in it to accommodate the taste. Overall food and service was good although there were some delays here and there but the employees were friendly and full of energy. Their menu is real simple and easy to choose from. I would definitely come here to eat and recommend this place to friends.  Note: Hostess is pretty cute.",

    "text": "Listen up and listen real good!  This past unprofitable trek to Clark County, I ventured over to a little joint they call The Lotus of Siam on my final day in town.  I was in between hotel rooms and took the tram to the SLS, where I proceeded to walk 10 long blocks on E Sahara with $2800 in Ben Franklins in my Fossil-brand wallet.  Not one of the smarter things I've done in this city of Gold, but it's exercise and I've heard so many great things about this joint that I refused to leave town without giving it a shot.  Let's just say that I'm sure I'll give this petty little business another go around, but it wasn't anything special and it most certainly isn't any Le Thai.  I love this place (Le Thai) and will eat here at least three times when I do my usual two night stay downtown on my three annual trips.  I've never had a bad experience, the staff is great and the food is fantastic.  I'll even come in all by my lonesome where the locals can stare at the guy with no friends and who likes to drink alone like rock icon George Thorogood.  I'm not embarrassed or ashamed.  I mind my own business and scarf down anything from the soups, papaya salads, thai wings, curries, fried rice, and (most importantly) the lemongrass daiquiri.  NOTHING epitomizes masculinity than one of those lemongrass daiquiri's.  They make the lemongrass syrup in house and I deposit those bad boys in my innards, if you know what I'm sayin'.  If Yelp allows me to post a picture of the papaya salad and daiquiri I took, would you possibly laugh at a 6'4\", sharp dressed outsider scarfin' that down all the way in the back of the joint by his lonesome?  Or how about at the bar for all of the patrons to see?  The prices are great (they have an amazing lunch special for $10 that can't be beat....not even a Ebola Burrito Bowl over at the Chipotle can compare).  The Lotus of Siam doesn't compare, either.    Go to Le Thai.  Good bye.",

We are Las Vegas locals, and this is one of our favorite places. We visit Le Thai about 3X per month, if not more. If we lived closer, it could be an every day kind of thing...It's that good.  We love the people that work at Le Thai and the patrons; it's been fun getting to know people while enjoying great food.  Check in on Yelp, and grab a drink on the patio (or even next door at Corduroy...either way, you can't go wrong), and get to know some Las Vegas visitor s and locals.  Drinks: We really like drinking the Thai beer, Chang, and they also make a mean Mai Tai that is fresh/clean and not too sweet. Service: The service is always impeccable at Le Thai.  We love to sit at the bar or in the bar area.  We have also sat on the patio where you can people watch while enjoying your dinner.  Food: The Thai Style wings, Thai salad, and 3 color curry w/brown rice are our favorites. Honestly, everything we have tried has been fresh and tasty.  If you want something changed to due to allergies, vegan status, etc. the wait staff is always willing and knowledgeable.  The restaurant has a great vibe, beaming with great people. Le Thai makes you feel like Las Vegas is a small and caring place. For that, we are thankful.",

Always makes us feel like a valued customers.  The food is very consistent.  I will say that spice level can be at times a little off,  but the food is delicious and tastes fresh. Off meaning ordering a level 2 (out of 5) can at times be a 1 or a 3.. not a huge deal.   For apps we get the crab Rangoon's and Spring rolls.  If we get there for happy hour we order waterfall beef,. Very good but filling.  Awesome flat noodles has become our new favorite. The Short Rib fried rice (ask for a fried egg on top) is always ordered with every mean we get.  The yellow curry is also an excellent choice.   The place is busy on the weekends so prepare for a wait, but it's worth it. We have tried a few other Thai places in Chinatown but nothing for us compares to Le Thai.   Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "After a day out on Fremont Street, all I wanted was some delicious thai food. I was so excited to find this place and to see all the raving reviews. I tried two items- chicken pad thai and their masaman curry with tofu. We were ordering take out at first, but after we received our food, we chose to eat it on the patio instead. The bartenders were quite friendly and the food was ready pretty quickly. The chicken pad thai was some of the best I've ever had, if not the very best. It was so flavorful and light- not too saucey but it didn't miss out on any flavors. I was obsessed and didn't want it to end. The masaman curry was very good as well. The chicken pad thai stuck out as being the star of the show though. Brendan agreed and my friends loved it as well. If I come back to Fremont Street, I'm running here for some more delicious pad thai.",

All the flavors from the dishes aforementioned was on point, like it hit the spot!!!  The restaurant is a bit small when you walk in. We were seated outside, the atmosphere was inviting and calm. Waitress and servers were friendly and professional. To top it off the music playlist was good.   Overall, I had a great first time experience here. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been hearing good things about this place for a while and finally decided to try it for ourselves. There is paid on-street parking not too far from the restaurant (if you're driving there and not staying someplace downtown).   It was well worth the trip. I had the short rib fried rice and my wife had the pad thai, both of which were excellent. We also shared the Waterfall Beef appetizer, which was also delicious. The prices are very reasonable for being downtown and they had some pretty good happy hour specials (M-F from 3-6) too. The service was also good. Everyone was attentive and friendly.   There are a few downsides to know about if you decide to come try it out. One, it's super small. They have a takeout window up front so you can conveniently get it to go, but I'd be surprised to hear if the max capacity was any more than 40 people. So if you go when it's busy, expect a wait. Two, there are only 2 or 3 tables inside (plus the bar); everything else is outdoor seating. However, I will admit that it was over 100 degrees the day we went and the beer garden (aka an enclosed rear courtyard with a canopy and misters) was surprisingly comfortable.",

We ordered papaya salad, pad kee mao, and crab rangoon to share. I'm from Seattle so I would say we're pretty blessed with great Thai Food, but Le Thai was amazing in of itself! The pad kee mao was the winning dish for lunch - the noodles weren't broken up (like they sometimes are) and had a nice rich flavor. Had plenty of veggies and a large enough portion to comfortably feed a group of 5.    We also got the natural unfiltered ginger ale for drinks - these were delicious as well! A great refreshment to fight off the heat from the food (we ordered 3 star and it was still relatively spicy!)",

Minor problem: each time I ask for a 2 out of 5 on the heat scale, it never comes out the same. Sometimes it's barely spicy, sometimes it's face melting. They need to make all the chefs be consistent with each other.  Also, why is this place not open past 2am on a Saturday night!!!? That's when I could go for some noodles. There's no decent food downtown after hours. They would kill it. If they stayed open a little longer on the weekends.",

Put our names down on the list and was told we had a 30-45min wait. No problem at all considering we are right there on freemont street, so we cruised around and checked out some stores while we waited. It was perfect timing because we walked around for about 45mins and headed back, but when we got back to Le Thai there was no greeter there, a worker then came outside and asked if we wanted to put our names down and we said we are on the wait list, she asked our names and then told us she could seat is then. It was good We got seated but seemed like if we didn't go back theyvwouldbhave forgot about us, maybe not I'm sure but that's the vibe the lady and I got. Place is busy and was crammed,pack with tables, not a problem though as many resturants are similar. We ordered a Thai tea, pork jerky, chicken satay, the pad Thai, and yellow curry heat 2. The dishes were all prepared great as in the meats were going very tender and cooked to perfection. The chicken satay was juicy, tender, and the satay sauce was amazing! The pork jery reminded me of smoke meat from back home and was a total opposite of the chicken satay. The satay was sweet and creamy, while the pork jerky with the waterfall sauce was. A sharp, vinegar taste. Not bad and the sticky rice was excellent as I love rice! The yellow curry was good. The carrots, potatoes, onions, and beef were cooked well and the curry was good. The spice level 2 was very mild but nice as dinner went on it kept a nice warming sensation going. My lady's pad Thai was ok. Seemed as though it was already mixed, noodles. Were chopped to make them more manageable to eat maybe? First time I've had pad Thai that came with chopped noodles and pre mixed. There was an aftertaste that I was not familiar with the previous pad Thais I've had in the past. It wasn't my cup of tea. Now the Thai tea, the Thai tea was probably the best I have ever had. It was a nice smooth, sweet, creamy Thai tea with no hints of bitterness or over brewing. A perfect compliment to our meal. Bravo on the Thai tea! It was an over all ok experience. While everything tasted good, it was just that....ok. Nothing jumped out at me with amazing flavors or textures. If I'm in the area I will see stop by for some Thai tea, but other than that my Thai food search is still going. I'm glad I tried Le Thai. You should to, it might be an amazing meal for your taste buds but for me it was ok, except for the Thai tea lol! That was awesome!",

I was impressed with the noodle selection - but actually have not had great experiences with the noodles in takeout form.  Once the drunken noodles were absolutely horrible - but that was my own ordering trouble as I ordered a 5 spice with ghost sauce when I really wanted a 3 spice.  The confusion stems from our other favorite Thai place downtown which is on a 1-10 scale.  Anyway, I digress.    Rather than delivery, today I went in to Le Thai and my whole world changed.  It is so cute, great cantina feel up front and a patio in the back with fabulous ambiance.  Backyard chic between 2 brick walls in the middle of downtown.  It is fully private from passerby's (so no visitors begging for food or money) with a bamboo roof that lets just enough sun in and misters that are perfectly placed.  It was 100 degrees out today with raunchy humidity and I was totally comfortable.  We even stayed and chatted for a LONG time.    And lastly the food.  I think I actually enjoyed the food more going there.  I'd like to try the drunken &/or awesome noodles again while at Le Thai - I have convinced myself I will like them more.  Today I had Ginger fried rice with shrimp at a level 3 spice and it was very good.  Spice was just enough to make my mouth tingle but not quite \"clear your sinus cavity\" hot.    Service was good and everyone was friendly.  So glad we went after the lunch rush because it was so great to sit and talk in this quaint place.   Oh and I went with a couple of very, very ANAL coworkers who both approved of the cleanliness of the kitchen.  I will definitely go back.  And after reading other posts I clearly need to try the waterfall . . . stay tuned . . . waterfall update to come!",

    "text": "I've been hearing all kinds of good things about Le Thai, but I have never been in the neighborhood around dinner time.  Last night, I was downtown for a happy hour when my tummy rumbles set in.  I knew it was about to be time for Le Thai and I was excited.  We were seated in the outdoor section of this tiny restaurant.  It was pretty hot out, even at 8pm but there are water misters going to cool things off.  When you combine that mist with the warm air, it almost gives the feeling of being in southeast asia.  The atmosphere was definitely not \"steps away from casinos and neon\" and that's a good thing.  For an appetizer we had our Thai go-to: chicken satay.  The peanut sauce was delicious although a tad bland.  The chicken was perfect.  The pieces were much larger than most other satay i have seen.  The chicken was also perfectly tender and juicy.  I can only dream of being able to cook chicken that perfectly.  My entree was Pad Kee Mow.  I ordered with chicken at medium spice.  DC ordered Pad See Eew with chicken at medium spice.  Both dishes were fantastic - among the best Thai food either of us have had.  As many others have noted, however, the food is damn spicy.  I generally have a high tolerance for spice and the medium was just a little much.  Heat aside, the food was incredible.  I want to try everything else on the menu.  Our service was lazy, but not in a bad way.  Maybe relaxed is a better word.  Servers were friendly and took orders on an iPhone.  Neat little touch.  The music was like a mix between West Elm and a dance club - very good vibe for the relaxed atmosphere.  We'll definitely be returning to Le Thai to try the rest of the menu (only this time with a slightly milder spice profile).",

The food was delicious, packed with flavor, seasoning was spot on however my reason for a 3* is : we found the portions *very* small. Thai is my favorite cuisine and I eat in Thai places at least few times a week and can easily say that the food was simply not enough to be a meal in itself here (which is hardly the case in most other Thai places).   If the portion was right, I would have given a 5* rating to the place.",

I couldn't believe this restaurant was in Vegas because it reminded me of some places I have been to in Asia. It was a pretty small place and very packed. We were seated in the outdoor patio, which was very very cool. I loved the ambiance out there. There was even a DJ playing some deep house which definitely set the mood for our dinner.   For my entree, I ordered a Thai Beef and Meatball soup with a spice level 3 out of 5. I would have gotten a 4 or 5 but I have been warned ahead of time that their dishes were very very spicy. When I got my soup, it definitely had some kick. I would say it was realistically an 8 out of 10 on the spice scale. This soup was absolutely delicious. It was just so flavorful and they definitely did not cheap out on the meat. The pieces of beef were very chunky and meaty and very tender.   My experience at Le Thai was amazing. I'm so happy that this place is in Las Vegas and I can drive 20 minutes to have this not so ordinary dining experience.",

It was off. It was a bit wonky. Felt a bit rushed. Our Server missed a couple of things that we had requested. The Hostess was also a bit off; wasn't super pleasant but wasn't rude. Just off. The Food Runners seemed more upbeat and \"on\" with their energy. Just weird. Food delivery was quick. Food wise. It was good. FOr the price point, it was pretty good. My number 3 spice level was decent and did start kicking in towards the end of my meal, so kudos! Although my Partner's dish didn't have enough kick, so he took a spoonful of my sauce and added to his to give it some kick, and it worked. The Pad Thai was pretty good! Pay attention to the Specials Board because no one told us about any specials and once I saw the board, I would have ordered that instead of my Pad Prik.",

From the excellent appetizers:  The wings are delicious, the Waterfall Beef is extraordinary, the Thai Jerky is sublime,  to name a few.    For the lunch specials, I recommend the tri-color curry or the basil bowl (i order it without the fried egg on top, as the fried egg on top is not my thing).  Both the Thai tea and coffee are over-sized and tasty.  The service is good, and everyone in the joint is pretty and friendly.    NOW for the best part:  It is in the heart of downtown near what was once a deplorable wreck of a street!  The ambiance in this place is superb, as you step off of Fremont into a niche of breezy cool!  I have sat both indoors and out, and been pleased by either location.  It gets a bit crowded at lunch time, but the setup still leaves you feeling like you have room to breathe.    The only complaint I have is that the heat has been inconsistent in the food.  I have had a weak 4 (they have a 1-5 heat scale) and a BLAZING 4.    Check it out and enjoy some awesome Thai, and be part of the \"new cool\" that Downtown Vegas is becoming.",

So, yeah maybe I haven't tried every single one in town, but this food is tasty and wonderful every time. Cool little spot (emphasis on little) that is great for lunch, dinner with friends or a late night post beers craving blaster. The service is friendly and they don't make you feel like a fool if you don't know every ingredient on the menu. The outdoor seating looks awesome for when it's not 100 degrees, the night we went and wanted to sit there it was closed. Sad face.   Any type of the curry chicken is awesome and the serving is huge. The chicken satay is tender and flavorful. I think my favorite may be the Awesome Noodles...YUM. Sweet and spicy, my two favorite things. By the way they are not kidding about the spice scale. I get a 1 and that is fine for me and I don't consider myself a spice prude....I don't even know how a human eats a 5 there.   A great place definitely worth the trip downtown, but it's tiny so you might have to wait a bit. Worth it!!",

The close proximity to Don't Tell Mama and Drink and Drag makes it that much better.  The first time I came here, I didn't even know they had a courtyard. This time, Katrina M. and I sat outside. We were not that hungry, but needed something to soak up the alcohol. The pork jerky was not bad. Served with a fragrantly spiced dipping sauce and sticky rice, it is a meal within itself. The massaman curry was what hooked me. The spicy, rich, complex flavors paired with brown rice hit the spot. Nothing goes better with alcohol than spicy food. I would suggest getting another meat other than beef, because it was tough. Otherwise, I was in love.   The staff was also very efficient. They worked as a team and it made everything a breeze. We ordered the app with one, three different people checked up on us, we ordered the entree with one of the three, and then the two order takers periodically dropped by.",

When we came here after our CYME, the place was kinda busy. We had 8 people and the wait would have been 45 minutes, BUT they had 2 separate 4 person tables near each other if we wanted. I was hungry and wanted to eat so we opted for the separate tables. The menu seemed kinda small IMO. I ordered the Le Thai rice dish. Our waitress said it had a lot of veggies but I only noticed some onions and cucumbers. I think it's weird to put cucumbers in a hot dish, but it worked. I got a spicy level 1 (out of 5) and it could have been a touch spicier. But I've learned eating Thai food, every place has it's own level of what they deem \"spicy\" so I always go with a low #. The portion was generous and the dish was tasty.  The have a check in offer on yelp, so make sure you do. It's a free hug! Yep, the waitress (or waiter) will give you a totally free, HUG, just for checking in! The service was good. Our waitress got our food and drinks rather quickly. The food was tasty and well priced.

    "text": "I don't know WTH happened on my visit, but it was not good.  My co-worker and I decided to check out Le Thai for lunch after reading and hearing the rave reviews.  We were seated outside after a 10 minute wait or so, which is typical at popping restaurant during lunchtime.  But things soon went downhill from there . . .   After taking our orders, my yellow curry took approximately 35-40 minutes to come out.  I had to ask for utensils twice once my food came out.  At the 45-50 minute point, my co-worker and I decided that we couldn't stay to eat and would need to take our food to go.  So we asked that her food (which hadn't come out yet) be placed in a container and asked for a container for my food.                  The waiter brought me a small, wire handle take out box.  Mind you, my bowl of yellow curry was pretty big and I hadn't eaten much of it.  I pointed this out to him and asked if I could get a bigger container, like my co-worker's, i.e., the round 7\" take out container.  The waiter took my food and the small take out box to the kitchen; BUT instead of packing my food into a bigger container like I asked, he came back with my food packed into the one, small take out box!!!  There's no way that my big bowl of curry fit into that small container, which means I paid for food that I did not eat or take with me.  By this point, we were really hungry and so ready to go.  I gave the waiter my card to pay, only to have him come back and say that their machine was down.  We waited approximately another 10 minutes, before he came back and said the machine was indefinitely down.  He then suggested we go to an ATM down the street and take out cash, or that we could speak with the manager to make \"arrangements.\"  WHAT?!?!?!?!  I'm not sure if the other waiter was out sick that day or what happened.  But we spent almost an hour and a half waiting for our food and/or trying to pay and leave.  We didn't get to eat until we got back to work.  I'm really sad because it was good but I just can't get over the trauma of bad service that day . . .",

They even have an app to check the wait time and get notified when your table is ready. The app is called \"no wait\" and if you download it, you can see wait times of various restaurants wait times in your area. The food we ordered: Thai chicken wings, crab rangoons, red curry pork, short rib fried rice, and chicken pad see ew. The spice level 4/5 was ordered and it was hot! The wings were small but crispy and tasty. The short rib fried rice came with a runny fried egg on top and it was amazing. The shredded bits of tender meat elevate the rice to another level. The rest of the food was above par as well. Now as for the service.... It was ridiculous how bad it is. We received our appetizers and we still had to utensils. We asked the waiter for some forks and he brought the three of us 3 forks and 1 napkin then jetted off leaving us there laughing. We pondered splitting it in thirds since the chicken wings were nice and greasy lol. It took about 10 minutes for us to flag down a waiter and ask for more. We never got refills on our drinks. It's just sad, I'd give this place five stars if the service was even decent.",

    "text": "Oh how I love you, Le Thai.  You're super tiny so I feel really cool eating here- as if I'm in the know.  You kept me warm outside on your patio with your portable heaters and extra spicy food.  You have servers who know exactly what is vegetarian-friendly and I don't ever feel like I might be getting accidently served fishes in my food.  Your spice levels aren't for the faint of heart.  When can we meet again?  I've been here twice, once on a busy Tuesday evening and once on a not-so-busy-because-we-are-trying-to-close Saturday around 1 a.m.  I may or may not have been drinking lots of wine before my second trip to Le Thai.  Both times we ordered the same thing: Thai tea, Awesome noodles, and Massamam curry.  Thai tea: not cheapy tasting tea like I've had elsewhere and with just the right amount of sweetness.  Awesome noodles: lots of fresh veggies and a slightly sweet sauce, the noodles are wide and perfectly cooked, and the noodles are balanced perfectly with the right amount of veggies.  Massamam curry: tons of flavor and spice and served with a healthy serving of steamed rice.  This is the only curry they can make vegan.  I've had it with tofu the first time and just veggies the second- I prefer veggies only.  Just a heads up, they showed me their heat scale for when you order.  \"Medium\" (which is what I always order) is a 2 on a scale of 5.  I would assume Medium would be a 3, but not here.  And Le Thai's Medium is almost too hot for me.  If you aren't into spicy food, order as low as they can go.  The menu is small, but they do it all right and that's all that matters.",

My co-workers and I were in the middle of a brainstorming session that we didn't want to interrupt, so it was perfect for us to call in our order, then pick it up 30 minutes later.  We ordered more than enough food for 4 adults:  -Tom Yum Soup with Chicken -Pad Thai with Chicken -Pad See Ewe with Pork -Red Curry with Tofu -Spicy Eggplant with Beef  Note: Stir-Fry and Curry dishes come with rice.  We didn't realize that, so we made rice at the apartment.  We ordered dishes with a variety of spice levels: 2 and 3. I eat spicy (i mean REALLY SPICY), so the Level 3 - Hot, was just normal spice to me.  When we went to pickup the food, service was great!  The staff was incredibly friendly!  Not only did they give us plastic utensils (as most take out places do), but they even gave us paper plates! (Believe me, the little things matter the most).",

The hostess told us 20-30 mins because they were so busy. So, we waited. But we stopped in to use the restroom and over half the tables were empty and the waitstaff was just hanging around chatting. They weren't busy at all. So, why the wait? We waited anyway, but annoyed as there was clearly no reason for us to wait all that time. The hostess said she would text when the table was ready. She did and we came. But apparently she also tried to call us and rudely expressed her annoyance that we didn't answer (while we were on our walk back to the restaurant - which, by the way, we may it back within the 10 minute window they allow).  So then we sit, we order, and we eat. While a waitress was refilling my water, she was too busy chatting with another employee to notice that she spilled water all over my meal and me. The food isn't good enough to make up for the rude hostess, distracted waitstaff and exaggerated wait times.",

I feel it denigrates my ratings but, in reality, it does the opposite; it actually rewards the privileged restaurants I get to go when they are excellent.  My friend Dan has been randomly touting this place  every time the word \"Vegas\" is mentioned.  I always thought, \" how can a Thai place be so outstanding\"? Well, it can!  First, it's in this revitalized part of downtown across from the el Cortez . It's a super cool restaurant inside, with a big misty patio.  I sat alone thank God, as the wait would have been 45 minutes. I sat at the counter and really cute waitress helped me, and I ordered a special- dry noodles w a variety of stuff. It was fresh and delicious. I can't say more.  I can't wait to go back, and since here for a few more days, I might.  I know, it will be more crowded w a 5 star review, but they deserve it.  One request- open in LA!",

Chicken satay- delicious peanut sauce  Fried egg rolls- crispy   Yellow curry and sticky rice- the cutest personal size of sticky rice! Great coconut flavor in curry.

We came in around 3pm and the place was full we sat outside with the water misters which helped a ton with the heat... for an hour I thought I was back in LA.   Staff was super friendly and attentive and our food was delicious. I ordered the Ga Pow stir-fry level 3 spicy it was spicy so if your looking for something with a little kick for flavor get spicy level 1-2.   It's also really nice that they offer brown rice if you prefer it over white rice and with out a substitution fee   Price point is perfect not to expensive. They also have a happy hour 3-6 with a generous selection of beers and cocktails.",

    "text": "The short rib fried rice is amazing! So many different flavors that blend together in an amazing way. I probably eat here at least once every week and always get the short rib fried rice.  Tip: come early for lunch! It opens at 11 and by 11:30 you'll already have a 20+ minute wait! So worth it, but if you want to be seated right away arrive as close to 11 as you can.  They do have a bar with about 5 seats and one smallish TV so it's not the ideal place for watching a game but is still phenomenal overall.  This is my favorite restaurant in downtown Vegas and I'd highly suggest it!",

Chicken Satay is moist, flavorful and this is the best peanut sauce I have ever tasted! Thai Salad with steak that was so tender, juicy with just the right amount of heat. Garlic fried rice with shrimp and plenty of shrimp I might add.  Great cocktail list. The mango margarita is delicious and they have a great beer list too. Casual and relaxing and the servers are so good here. Excellent service this time from Brian and I wish this place was in Palm Desert! I'd be eating here at least 3 times a week! Our favorite restaurant when in Vegas. A must go!",

    "text": "This is my fourth time at Le Thai. Located close to Fremont and not too far off from the courthouse and the law offices, it's a little place that stays busy. You'll have everyone from tourists to locals. This location has three areas you can sit in. There's a couple tables in front of the restaurant outside, a little bar area with a couple small tables inside, and lastly, a back outside area for larger groups of 4-5.   The two things I get frequently and recommend are the Three Color Curry with your choice of chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp and the Fried Rice Short Rib.   The Three Color Curry is a mix of their Yellow, Green, and Red Curry. It's super good. Ive had it with everything but beef and shrimp is my favorite way to go. You'll have an option of white or brown rice to be able to enjoy with that curry. Their spicy scale is 1 - 5. I love spicy food so their five was. Itching to me. Those with a good tolerance would probably want to add more. They have a little spice tray to adjust it to your preference they can bring you.   The Fried Rice Short Rib is their signature dish. It is pretty fantastic. They knock the meat off the short Rib and toss it in their to make a mouth water dish. The part I enjoy the most? They toss a fried egg on top of there. If you're really hungry, this is the one.   The service is good, too. If they mess up your spicy rating, they will not hesitate to make you a new batch. This happened to my boss and they were quick to not charge him.",

When we arrived I checked in to make sure they received the reservation and they did so my friend and I walked around a bit to waste time and check out Downtown Vegas.  We ended up waiting at least an additional hour on top of what the Yelp wait time said so that was very disappointing. When we finally sat down our waiter was nice and the food was tasty. Although the drinks were watered down so I would skip that in the future.    I wouldn't go back for dinner due to the wait time but I would check it out for lunch and hope for a better outcome.",

My daughter attend mama school close by so dining there after her activities is easy. So I go, our sever was terrible. We had to flag her dog each time we needed something... definitely looked understaffed.   Today!! Wow go place a take out order (I refuse to dine in any longer) took me 20min on hold!!! Just to place the order. When o did place the order the bartender was so short, he practically hung up on me... no joke... didn't even say \"BYE!l I get there ... my name was wrong... took 5 min to figure out which one was my order... no apologies... nothing.

We were told about an hour wait and were given seats in their waiting area.  We ordered some beers and a bottle of wine and waited...  and waited.... and waited.  Until two hours had passed.  We saw table after table getting seated, parties of two, parties of four.. I finally asked 'Is it possible for you to NOT seat them so we can get a table?  Cause you know a few two tops or a few four tops would accommodate a table for seven.'  This apparently is beyond them.  From the sounds of it they have one table for large parties and unless that specific table is open you are out of luck.  At 11pm we finally got really mad and just went to Hennessy's who seated us immediately and had food on the table promptly.  So we arrived around 8pm and finally left at 11pm.......  CRAZY!  I will never go here again because not only did they not seat us, they acted like we were nuts trying to get into their restaurant with a party of seven.  You are right we were crazy!  Never again.",

You almost feel you shouldnt order PadThai noodle. Thats how hip this restaurant is.",

But is it worth the trouble to get there and get seated? I went with a group early and managed to get a table outside in winter but they had radiant heaters so aside from the food getting cold quickly it was mostly comfortable. It is family style and we all sampled most of the popular menu items. The Drunken Noodles are amazing and unique. Aside from that one dish I found the food very ordinary and boring. Can't understand why everyone was raving. There are far better choices around town with one nearby to this place (Lotus of Siam) being vastly superior (actually Lotus is superior to most places) but there are lots better than Le Thai. If you go try the drunken noodles.",

Making sure we had waters, an over few of the menu and trying to get 3 beer coazies for our check-in on yelp. I ordered the wing appetizer and pad Thai with peanut sauce, my girlfriend got the yellow curry and crab something or other.  The food was hot and although not my favorite pad Thai, I prefer something more traditional it was good. All in all we enjoyed the food. Nice little spot to have a decent meal in Vegas.",

I typically go for the pad see ewe but opted instead for the awesome noodles with pork. Its the savory cousin to PSE and didn't disappoint, neither did the chicken satay or the curry. Their spice level for me was spot on. I ordered a 3 and it felt appropriately like a 3, not too spicy with just the right amount of kick. Also another dish that is unique to Le Thai is their short rib fried rice. It was absolutely tasty. The atmosphere here is very nice and fits well with that of other restaurants/bars in the downtown area. Their outdoor seating was pleasant with misters that mist intermittently. I will most definitely be back to Le Thai",

Sure it was tolerable (barely) because of the misters but at least ASK if that's ok. The hostess doesn't seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat.   Our waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later condiments.  We were brought a carafe of water and two little bitty glasses.....did I mention it was about 110 degrees out. But the Coke I ordered (because it was included in lunch special) was in a huge glass :/  On to the important stuff, the food!  Thai crispy wings-delicious! Flavor soaked into the meat. The sauce they serve with it is a mayo base, not that great so at least the wings were good.   Panang curry with chicken-average, good but nothing special  Beef and meatball noodle soup-average, good but needs some work.  Pad Thai-delicious! Pleasantly surprised :)  We ordered everything spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected. We love spicy food!!  So food is overall good, service average and atmosphere cramped inside and hot outside (during summer).  Probably won't return unless we are in the area and craving Pad Thai.",

If you're not looking for authentic Thai, but a good restaurant, it's a great place to go. I love, love, love their alcoholic Thai Tea and Thai Coffee (which is why I gave it the 4 stars).

She had to wait outside the restaurant until I made it there. Once I was there we asked for a table and she said it will be couple minutes, \"let me ask the server if she is ready\" so she asked the server and she came back saying that it will be couple more minutes, the restaurant wasn't full or busy at all, it was a Tuesday night.

They were also very accurate on the heat of the curries (#s 0-5) and describing the specials.     I had the Tom Ga soup which I would put on the same tasty level as Lotus of Siam's Tom Kah Kai. I also ordered the pork fried rice, it had a nice smokiness to it, so many places create such a bland or oily fried rice, this is one of my benchmark dishes. Next on my list to try is the 3 color curry bowl which I hear is excellent.    The smallish menu is nice, not so many overwhelming choices. And with the specials changing regularly, I will still have many options to taste over time.    The indoor space is nice, intimate, and clean. There is a large window into the kitchen so you can see the flurry of cooking activity. It was fun speaking with the others diners at their tables, we were sharing opinions on our dishes. I heard nothing but compliments from the other diners.    I live in the area so I look forward to more dining opportunities.  Thank you and welcome to the neighborhood!",

Really great prices and a full bar which is a plus. We had a big group had plenty left over and everyone had drinks and we got out of there spending around 20.00 per person.

Pretty good food, but the prices are a tad expensive ($10 for Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, or Pad-See-Ew) but I can understand because of it's location right across from Insert Coins.  However, I do like the food though; it's well made with just the right amount of spice (fyi the spice level is from 1-5 with 2 being medium). If you are going for take out this place usually takes about 20-30 min. to prepare food, but it's worth the wait in my opinion. Highly recommend shrimp Pad-See-Ew and Shrimp Drunken Noodles ($2 extra for shrimp). Great place for lunch!!",

We were at in a back patio area which was outdoors and it was really hot out. Roughly 90-95 degree and it just rained. So it was humid too. It was really stuffy in the area, plus all the hot plates goin out and only 2-3 tables open so it was busy. I did not want my family to be eating in that type of environment. I decided to see if we can dine at the front. A new hostess was at the front and while my family was waiting at the front with me while I was asking if we can get served outside... The new hostess with tattoo's on her arm was probably the rudest hostess I've had to deal with in my 13years dining in Vegas. I've worked in f&b since I was a kid. If It wasn't my server Tia doing an awesome job. This would of gotten 1 star. Unless the hostess owns the joint I would of fired her on the spot. I'm a bartender in this town and a GM of a bar. I would not recommend this place to anyone I come across. Shows how important a first impression can ruin a whole meal. Plus the food was mediocre at best.",

    "text": "Great food, not so great service. Stopped in to Le Thai after the CMYE event at Commonwealth with fellow Yelpers. While at Commonwealth I could smell the food from Le Thai and knew I had to go try it. We walked up to front and asked for a table for 8. The girl was on her phone (later realized they use an app on their phones for the business) and went in to check on tables. Came back and told us 45 minutes. We were going to go elsewhere but then asked if we split the group up how long wait would be. She went back in and came back with menus to seat us. She couldn't mention that before hand? We got seated and the two tables we were sat at were really close, didn't understand why they couldn't just put them together. Anyway, we ordered with the fairly unfriendly server and waited for our food. The wait time was not bad and the food was delicious. I ordered the short rib fried rice and just a 1 on the spicy scale (0-5 here) and I was glad I did because I think a 2 would have been too much for me. Added a fried egg on top and it was just about perfect. Good amount of meat, perfectly cooked rice and very flavorful. We were just about done eating when the server came and brought the check to our table... a big NO NO for me. This isn't Dennys! A clear sign that they don't care about you is putting down a check early to rush you out the door. When we were ready to pay for the check... she was nowhere to be found. We waited a bit and then Molly gave up and went to go find someone who would take our money. Please get rid of the phone app and use paper or something. It just looks ridiculous and I can't tell if you are on facebook or paying attention to my order.",

    "text": "The first in my series of Jury Duty reviews.  I had the pleasure of sitting on a near three week jury selection process recently.  Where do I begin with the downsides of this?  The mind-numbingly dull periods of waiting? The insulting $40 a day pay scale?   The most extreme example of governmental inefficiency I've ever witnessed?   Okay let's skip to the good:  the food!  No I didn't let myself become resigned to eating at Capriottis on the first floor on a daily basis, instead I ventured out into the world unafraid of having to go through the metal detectors a 2nd time, and am I glad I did so!  My first stop was Le Thai, a place I've been wanting to try for a while now but I simply don't make it downtown enough to have ever made it.   I walked there by myself because early on in the three week process I was my usual socially anxious self.  This could be a plus when going to Le Thai as it is seemingly always crowded.  While I have a perpetually crippling fear of ending up on the tableforone tumblr page, I threw caution to the wind and was pleasantly surprised to find myself at a bar where I might have blended in with the other patrons at the time.   You'll never catch me tableforone!  I ordered the Ga Pow with Chicken which is essentially a Thai Basil dish which is my standard at any Thai restaurant, so it was a no brainer for me to order the lunch special.   I went with a Spice level 3 (out of 5) to play it safe, and had it made out of brown rice (bonus!)   The first real pleasant surprise came in the form of a fried egg that was lovingly placed on top of the entree.  In my book you can't go wrong with a fried egg, and I thought it perfectly complemented the flavors of the Ga Pow.  As for the Ga Pow itself I thought it was extremely tasty and hearty, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.   I didn't find the spice level 3 to be very spicy in the least, and decided I'd kick it up a notch if I ever returned.  That happened about a week and a half later, when Le Thai was the first of the downtown restaurants to earn a repeat visit from me.  This time there was a bit more of a wait (even though it was still me by my lonesome), and I again was seated at the bar.   I decided to try the Thai Beef Salad this time to mix it up a bit, and brought the Spice Level up to a 4.  When they brought out my salad I was almost embarrassed by the size.  It looked like something you would get at Claim Jumper.  Even when I started trying to dig in with my fork, pieces from other sides of the plate were spilling off onto the bar.   There's some law of physics that could properly describe this phenomenon, but for now I'll call it the law of \"WTF why is there 8 lbs of salad on my plate?\"  As far as taste, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly something I'd order again.  The ingredients were fresh, and the individual components were fine, but it was just lacking a certain something when taken as a whole.  Make sense of that, because I can't.   Oh yeah, it was also too spicy to me.  This is again why I hate the scale of 5.  3 isn't spicy enough, and 4 is too much.   7 out of 10 is perfect, I can't translate it any other way.    I've seen some service complaints, but both times I was served by the same gentleman at the bar and service was fast and friendly so no complaints there.    Prices were pretty much in line with other Thai restaurant experiences, maybe slightly higher.  After more visits and sticking to dishes that revolve around rice, egg, and not veggie intensive, I could see myself bumping it up to a 5 eventually.  For now Le Thai will have to settle with Le Four.",

A few appetizers are also on the happy hour menu.  The food is as good as always and we have finally figured out the various spice levels for the entrees we like.  For some reason the ginger fried rice really needs a 4 but the Tom Yum soup is very spicy at a level 2 and the other dishes we usually go with a 3 and they are perfect.  We had a great service from Olivia who is a new server and if you have the option, you should request her she was great.",

Initial thoughts upon entering, the restaurant was slow but it was the middle of the day on a Friday. We chose to set in the back deck area which was very nice except I think the mist machines are a bit too much, they are nice but maybe a little bit less as water builds up on the table, food, etc.   Onto the food: The wings are to die for. Seriously, so good. You will not be disappointed. I had the Pad Thai with a level 3 on the 1-5 scale of heat. Again, very good. Would recommend to anyone. Something like $3 canned beers which is a nice change from staying on the strip.  I saw someone comment on the music being too \"BET\", maybe whoever is working controls the music but the mix that was on while we were there was mumford and sons, and some other indie music.

She will text you when your table is ready. Yes the restaurant is small, no it isn't fancy. It is just about the best Thai food you will ever eat, EVERYTHING on the menu is great. Everything is fresh. THe short rib fried rice is over the top. You will want to marry the chef.  What a treat after a day or two of the trendy overpriced strip dining halls. Downtown Vegas is a hip trendy place filled with the widest assortment of people. The light show outstanding. A destination in itself.",

    "text": "My first time in Vegas and I saw this Thai place had good reviews--that's good, because I wouldn't have found it otherwise due to it being a small family-owned restaurant with almost no signage outside the building.  If you're expecting a nice fancy Thai restaurant, you may be disappointed. But if you come knowing you're going to get a nice home cooked Thai meal with a simple cozy atmosphere, you will be pleased. We were seated outside for dinner, and they had water sprayers that misted the air to cool you down, so I think the temperature was better than inside.  My food was spicy (I'm a whimp) but delicious. We had a grande old time talking to a family seated next to us. It was more than just dinner; Le Thai turned it into an enjoyable evening. :)",

The menu is very limited and has no Papaya Salad. The Pad See Ew was mushy and did not have that signature Thai flavor. The soup was ok the best of the three, but each dish tasted the same. Maybe they ran out of ingredients because it just did not taste like real Thai food. I would not eat here again and that's too bad because I work downtown and love Thai. The other reviews for Le Thai seem fake to me! Komal is still the place to go and actually every other Thai I have tried in town is better.  Oh and the service was lacking. Not a good first impression.",

    "text": "We tried Le Thai after reading many good reviews here. Unfortunately nothing lived up to our expectations.  We went early eve and were the only table in the indoor dining area and there were a couple people in the patio and a few people at the bar. We liked the interior, reminded us of L.A. Seemed like the kind of place locals would stop in after work Ordered spring rolls, Waterfall beef with sticky rice, Tom Yum shrimp soup, Awesome noodles with shrimp and Ginger fried rice with pork. I like very spicy hot food but my partner doesn't at all so ordered 2 of 5 on their spice level, playing it safe.  Spring rolls were nondescript.  Waterfall beef was tasty but no heat at all. Even my partner thought It had no heat.  Also, was poorly cut if you're only given a fork to eat with. If the intent was to eat it with the sticky rice, enveloped as you would a naam tok, they missed the mark with the way the rice was served, in a little  narrow tall basket. Way too awkward. Also the sticky rice was over cooked.   Tom Yum soup was perhaps the worst I've had. very bland broth with over cooked shrimp, white button mushrooms and diced tomatoes. The tomatoes overpowered the soup and the mushrooms were, bland, just plain wrong. Awesome noodles were bland, void of any heat, a poor dish.  Ginger fried rice was also bland and no heat, another poor dish  Service was also below average. First table wobbled a lot. No wedges and folded napkins didn't cut it. no problem. moved to adjacent table. problem solved.   We received paper napkins rolled around a fork. Food arrived w/o any serving spoons or utensils. Getting the waiters attention was harder than should have been.  we left a lot of food on the table. We were offered to go containers but I didn't want any reminders of that meal.   Le Thai strikes me as a very VERY americanized thai restaurant. Even if the food we had was prepared with a much higher heat rating, I doubt it would have been good. The mediocrity of the food was not a matter of heat, it was just poor cooking.",

Being a four-top we ordered three appetizers to share.  Unfortunately those had gluten, but our waitress was really helpful and accommodating.  They manager even came over to give me options like the other members of the group.  I ended up with a Thai salad minus the oyster sauce.  Yum.  I appreciated that they were attentive without making an embarrassingly big deal about my dietary needs.  My three curry was excellent.  The other people had green curry and spicy eggplant and pad sei ew.  They said they were great. Most of the menu can be gluten and dairy free, so I really had a lot of choices.  They let us open our own champagne with a small corkage fee. Plus, the chairs were comfortable and we could have a conversation even with good music playing.  Another great find on my trip.  Definitely will come back to this hip and fun place again.",

Very friendly and she made sure our hungry needs were satisfied. She recommended a dish that I've never tried which was the crab fried rice! It was Fire  delicious. We ordered the the crispy spring rolls, awesome noodles, and cucumber  salad. Sorry the pictures were late because the food was delicious!!! We were so full we took the fried rice and  also ordered Rangoon to-go.  Our dining experience was five star  great here in Vegas! Thank you!",

The Charleston location is great and has never got me sick, but this one doesn't really get it. They assured me everything would be cleaned (they of course gave the spiel about no separate kitchen space, which is the chance you take to feel like a normal person I guess), and I got what I was told was the safest item on the menu, but my food came out a little too quickly, I was ill by the time I got home and it ruined the rest of my trip. If you've got no gluten issues this place is amazing and the staff were really nice, but if you're attracted by the gf fair because you have a serious autoimmune disease, just know that it's only for the fad dieters, not people who really need it unfortunately.",

My impression of the bartender who took the order is that she lacks waitress skills, although is probably a good mixologist.  When the order was ready she called me to come up and get the order.   A couple came by and also sat outside.  When their order was ready, the bartender brought them their order, even though they only ordered one more item than I did.  She asked them later how everything was, but never asked me.  You never forget how people make you feel.  I have been to a lot of Thai restaurants and known many Thai people who are all incredibly gracious and cordial, so it pains me to say that this about their service.    This restaurant also has no Thai furniture, no pictures of the King, and no Buddhist symbols.  Their choice of course, but most Thais don't neglect these things.  Leads me wonder about the authenticity of the restaurant.  On their heat scale of 1 to 5, I asked for a 2, which was surprisingly hot. It was the Mixed Vegetables with Tofu off the Lunch menu.  The vegetables were a bit soupy which would have been fine if the rice wasn't in a separate container.   The tofu was clearly fried or refried because it was on the hard and crunchy side.  They are overrated.  They are on Fremont Street, not because they are a gem in a food desert, but because they wouldn't make it elsewhere and standards are low.",

The noms are excellent, my favorite being the yellow curry chicken with rice. I think $13 is more than fair for the quality and amount you receive. I've tried the short rib rice too which was great but their curry is just my favorite, I'm looking forward to trying the 3 curry mix next time. (And check the chalk board when you walk in for meal/drink specials - worth it)   All of the employees here are great and so nice, I've always had excellent service! I really enjoy the outdoor seats too, I always get put in the same table, it must be where they put the wierdys, I accept this  I hold off on 5 stars because I really wish they stayed open later than 11, and sometimes the wait to be seated can take longer than told even with reserving the spot via yelp. But the wait is always MORE than worth it.",

    "text": "After two visits, this is definitely our FAVORITE Thai restaurant right now. My first visit was on 04/12/2013 and I was expecting a lot since I read all the raving reviews on Yelp and fortunately, it delivered. We tried their Chicken Pad Thai, 3 Color Curry, and (Minced) Pork Pad Kee Mow.   The Pad Thai was honestly not my favorite preparation of this classic dish, but it was still tasty. The 3 Color Curry was so much fun! It's \"Le Thai's special blend of red, yellow and green curry and all its vegetables\" which includes Bamboo shoot, bell pepper, Thai basil, potato, onion, and carrots in coconut milk. The flavor was obviously unique and well done. I don't care for potatoes in my curry, so next time, I'll stick with my favorite, red curry. Now, the Pad Kee Mow was out of this world. Top 10 favorite dish of all time (I don't have an official Top 10 list, but if I did, it would be on there somewhere). I mean, SOO DELICIOUS! I'm not even a big Pad Kee Mow fan and have never been, so this changed my life.  On my second visit (04/21/2013) with friends, we tried the Short Rib Fried Rice (Pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion, topped with cilantro) and of course, I ordered the Pork Pad Kee Mow again, Thai Salad (Grilled beef or chicken with red and green onion, tomato and cilantro mixed with lime juice and Thai chili), and Green Curry. This trip solidified my love for the place and its Pad Kee Mow. Perfection in a bowl. The salad was okay, not something for me in the flavor department.  The restaurant itself is cool, the outside/inside dining is cozy (but loud on weekend nights). Service is just okay. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. The wonderful food more than makes up for it. Honestly, I can't think about anything else but that delicious Pork Pad Kee Mow. Eat it. Oh, and spice levels aren't playing around. I wish I could remember what level I ordered because I definitely need to take it down a notch. I sweated...and it wasn't because of the weather.",

Everything on the menu is amazing, but my two faves are the Chicken Tom Yum Soup and the Short Rib Fried Rice. If you're super hungry or just want to get your meat fix, add extra short rib. It's delicious. Make sure to call on your way there or put your name on the wait list through Yelp, cause the wait can be lengthy. Also, sometimes they close completely for private parties but don't notify via their website or Yelp, so it's better to plan ahead so you're not disappointed.",

All delicious. Large portions. Delicious is an under statement. We also often get a cucumber salad - a refreshing side dish. OH! And if you go in the evening? Enjoy the spicy peanuts. Seriously delicious and flavorful!!  Service Everyone here from host to the waiters and waitresses, bar staff and manager are all super friendly and professional. They are usually slammed in the evening but the service remains amazing none the less. I am surprised they keep smiles on their faces despite the constant rush of patrons in and out, We always give a generous tip to reflect their excellent service!  Wait Time Be prepared to wait if you come later in the evening. You can download the \"no wait\" app to add yourself to the list on a busy evening.   Location Fremont is a bustling and hip area of vegas - just far enough from the Fremont experience to avoid the madness but close enough to benefit from the busy ambience. And if you have to wait for a table, there are tons of bars in close proximity to grab a drink in.   10/10 for everything! We love Le Thai!!",

So, on a recent trip, I decided to check it out for myself to see what was going on.  I told The Better Half to save her appetite so we could sample some food in the area.  After walking around a bit, we decided to check out this joint.  We ordered:  Pad Thai Tofu, $13 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  Pad See Ew, $13 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  The food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.  Our server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.  The only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.  Overall, great restaurant.  Glad to see them busy and they appear to be thriving.   Return Factor - 92%",

Back to the rice... Every scoop had juicy threads of short rib intertwined with the grains & medium spice had just the right amount of heat without being too intrusive & allowing to enjoy the flavors of the waterfall sauce, garlic, etc...   Not sure if it was because we were drinking, hungry as hell & it was 3AM but this satisfied the hell out of my late night munchies.

For lunch, they have a variety of curries and a few other dishes as specials (comes with rice and a soda). My dining companion and I split a 3 Color Curry with Shrimp and some Chicken Pad Thai. Also got two Thai Iced Teas. The curry, being a lunch special, had a scoop of rice on the bottom. The flavors of the different curries really blended well and complemented the shrimp. The Pad Thai was okay, nothing to write home about. It oddly didn't come with lime, which I usually see with Pad Thai.  FYI the massaman curry is *not* gluten free.",

I'm also extremely biased given the fact I have a favorite thai place in NYC that I compare every other thai place too. The ambiance at Le Thai was dope. Super chill and relaxed. The wait on a Tuesday night was an hour and a half. That could possibly be because the venue is rather small. The service was a little sketch. I was dining with 2 other coworkers and they were half way done with their food when I began to grow impatient with the fact my meal had no come out yet (it was a mix between being hangry, a little tipsy and jet lagged.) I ordered the chicken pad see eww and spring rolls. The portions are HUGE and even for me -- someone who is obsessed with pad see eww, I ended up taking a pretty big chunk of it home. I would give Le Thai another try the next time I'm in Vegas. I'm not going to kick it out the running just yet.",

On the other hand, this is one of the few places I been where I ordered something spicy, and didn't feel the need to add more spice.    I think the dish was okay in general, but I was expecting more from the high reviews I'd read.  If the place had wowed me, I would have brought the GF back for dinner (she's a huge pad thai fan), but it just struck me as average.",

Yes, the location is convenient if you are already downtown, but the prices were fairly high here ($9 each for lunch specials...shown in pics) and $13 for the Pad Kee Mao! Probably the most I've ever paid for this staple!  But prices aside, how does the food fare? Because that is all that matters when searching for the best of the best!  Have to say I was disappointed!   Although my baby loved his tofu and mixed veggies :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#T1qpoYYf5aG4hAROkF0HUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  The Pad Ka Pao and Pad Kee Mao were NOT very spicy (maybe a 5/10 in my book) when asking for a Thai spicy 5/5 on their scale, and the dishes weren't memorable!   The Ka Pao felt like it was missing something :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ZzFcqxklGCNa5NCK-L7Apw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  The presentation was beautiful and mouth watering with them mincing up the meat just how I like and with the fried egg on top, but maybe the meat wasn't cooked long enough in the juices, because it just wasn't flavorful enough.  Tasted like it was missing something vital that everyone else has, and I always order this dish trying a new Thai spot in town.  The Kee Mao was very very oily :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#0o-6s4elvRBGJHvxewPA_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  Look at the coloring on the noodles! It had a good flavor, but the oils were very heavy and caught up later if you know what I mean...Just compare the COLOR of the noodles to a known competitor and you can see what I mean about that oil! :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?select=hQ_CNCpMGO70mnL7vy55jg#JCVcxvcLGhlfJivt4Ceoww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-...</a>  My baby loved his food though!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#RGxx_22s1Q3ldI9OqyjrBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-t...</a>  If you are searching for nearby eats downtown, maybe give it a go! If you are searching for the best Thai in town....keep looking!",

I ordered a Thai tea, Thai style wings, and short rib fried rice, which was enough for two. I loved everything I ordered but probably would order a spice level 3 instead of 4.

    "text": "Me and my husband ate here three years ago and couldn't wait to return on our trip back to Vegas. Last time we were not that hungry and were super bummed we wasted the good leftovers... This past experience was way different. We showed up and the hostess informed us she had a 45min wait just to be put on a wait list? Who does that? Why can't you just put everyone on a wait list and give a realistic wait time. I felt like she didn't want our business. She did however inform us that we can do take out so we decided to take that route. We went to the take out counter and again the guy said it would take 45min for take out in a tone that kinda made me feel like they didn't want our business. I told him it's fine and we put in our order and went to the bar next door which was actually really cute and I loved the atmosphere. We got back to our hotel room and the food was piping hot which was nice. The spring rolls were really yummy, the chicken pad Thai ordered at a level 2 was too spicy for my and besides the spice it didn't have much flavor, the noodles looked whiteish and I remember it being more red last time so that was a super disappointment. The short rib fried rice was actually really good and they use real short rib meat it was super yummy. My husband liked the pad Thai and I liked the rice. The food is good but probably not the best Thai I have ever eaten. The reason for the three stars is the management needs to get their staff on a better program for wait times and maybe teach them a thing or two about customer service. I forgot to mention we asked if we could make a reservation for a later day and she said they only do that for large parties. It's just ridiculous to be so vague about when you can actually sit and feed someone. We may come back and give it another shot next time but only because my husband likes it.  THIS IS MY UPDATE to management response: Dan and Shauna, I feel like you got defensive instead of apologetic and didn't thoroughly read my review let me be clear. 1. Your hostess told me and the people before me we would have to come back in 45 minutes to be put on the wait list. She wouldn't even put us on a wait list. I would have been fine if she said I can put you on a wait list but it's a two and a half hour wait but she suggested we come back in 45min just to be put on a wait list this was my complaint...  2. She also informed me that she would take reservations but only for parties of six or more.   Clearly there is miscommunication between management and staff. I wouldn't pull this outta nowhere it's the truth and my experience and a simple apology would have sufficed. Thank you.",

I've had Pad See Ew all over town, & hands down...Le Thai has the best! The noodles had a sweetness to it & they even serve it with a fried egg on top. Something we haven't has anywhere else. The wings were fried perfectly & the sriracha sauce was delicious.   Can't wait to go back! Yum!",

We all very much enjoyed the food, the curry was absolutely yummy and the price was extremely reasonable.  For 12 people with drinks our bill was only $170.00 I do not care for restaurants that automatically add gratuity for large parties and was pleased to see that they did not do that. As an industry worker dependent on tips I like to tip more than the average person but when an auto gratuity is added I do not care to bother with the math, unless the service was exceptional!    Definitely a great place to visit for a good time with friends and family. We will be back for more yummy goodness.",

No one ever came to our table. So we go up and left. On the way out the girl said \"Oh you changed your mind?\" Ummm ya... we did. FAIL. Oh and just an FYI - the menu is tiny!!!

    "text": "Never have I left a restaurant without leaving a tip, even when receiving sub-par service. But tonight was a 1st and I worked many years in the service industry. It was really bad! I gave 1 stars for the food as it was average Thai food and the restaurant had a cool vibe. From the beginning the server seemed uninterested in serving us, maybe because we all ordered water and not liquor (idk). She asked us if we saw the specials that were posted in the front (we did not), she told us what the specials were but could not provide prices. Not sure why? They were supposed to be SPECIALS. Non the less we ordered off the regular menu as it seemed too difficult for her. Food took about 1/2 an hour, appetizer took about 20mins (which we had to initiate). We ate and enjoyed conversation for a while, we realized no one had been around to take plates away or check up on us in sometime. Finally the server comes over with the check in hand and says she is going on break and we can cash out with so&so when we are ready. But my daughter wanted desert and we wanted to pack up the left overs. She said she would put in the dessert before her break and be right back with the check and to go boxes. She brought back the check but no the boxes. We had to waive down the other server for the boxes. And then we waited and waited and waited, the table next to us ordered and received their food before we got our dessert. Actually our dessert never came until we were standing by the bar to get cashed out because no one ever came to do that either. The dessert came out as we were standing there, by that time I was extremely annoyed and said to the runner who brought it out that we ordered that like 40 minutes ago. I wasn't going to send it back as my daughter was already bummed thinking we were going to leave without it, so the runner packed it up quickly while someone else was cashing us out. We live in Henderson, so to come all the way downtown for bad service doesn't make me want to come back for any restaurants. I do have my go to Thai place closer to us, but I like to support the downtown community. Not feeling like it anymore.",

It's always packed. A friend wanted to eat there for her bday so I obliged. I went very early and was glad I did. The place was already crowded. My wait time was about 15 minutes so not too bad. It is pretty warm inside and on the patio, even with the misters.  My waitress was friendly and they have good happy hour deals. The beef salad was lacking much beef, but was tasty. The short rib fried rice was excellent and the Thaihitos were refreshing.  If you don't like lines, crowds, or loud places...don't go. If you can handle it, then it's worth giving it a chance. So many excellent Thai places here that it's hard to drag myself downtown when I could get delivery on the couch.  I'm giving it 3 stars due to the wait and temperature. I wouldn't make a special trip just to eat there, but if in the area and there's a short wait I would eat there again. They don't take reservations for small groups so it's every man for himself. Good luck!",

Worth trying if you visit this place.  The bill wasn't too expensive but there are probably better choices in the area. I honestly don't know why the wait for this restaurant can be 45 mins to an hour. Maybe try calling to reserve if you plan togo here.  We were lucky we were just a party of two so we didn't have to wait. They let us sit in the side bar.",

The waitress warned me that two sticks  would be filling , but for six dollars I couldn't imagine them being that big.   I must say that I was wrong. The happy hour appetizer chicken skewers would be equivalent to two full-size chicken breasts. It came with a small cucumber salad and peanut satay dressing. It was really delicious. I couldn't even finish the appetizer and I was hungry.   I ordered a beer so I didn't feel like such a Jew, and could give the waitress a big tip.  I am seriously full with a happy belly.",

    "text": "A little Thai restaurant located down on Fremont Street, Le Thai's one of those unassuming restaurants that you might not notice at first glance if you're walking down Fremont Street.   RESTAURANT There isn't much seating inside the restaurant, which I've noticed can fill up fast during lunch time. No sweat, there's a shaded dining area outside. My friend and I lunched out there during 100+ degree temps, so it was literally \"no sweat\" because the space is well-equipped with misters.   FOOD Panang (tofu) with Brown Rice:  I ordered  a spicy level 3 out of their 1-5 scale, which wasn't spicy enough for me. Hardly was there any kick to my curry, but this might be due to the fact that the rice was mixed into my dish. Can't say I'm a fan of that because I don't eat much rice to begin with, and I didn't have control over how much rice I wanted to consume (I can't go into work and fall into a rice coma while at my computer.). But in all seriousness, I wasn't expecting that because I'm accustomed to having rice served on the side.  As for the Panang Tofu, it receives an OK in my book, though I like how there were bamboo shoots.    SERVICE It was on the slow side. Unsure if it was because it became busier inside.   OVERALL Service is slow, but the food isn't bad if you're looking for something decent and a little healthier to eat among the dining choices in Downtown.",

It might be because I know what good Thai food tastes like. We ordered:   pad thai - very unusual, tasted okay, looked like a Vietnamese goi (salad)  3 kind curry - this one was pretty good, but really.. how can you mess up curry...  thai beef ball noodle soup - very little soup, soup was very light and bland which isn't supposed to be for this kind of soup, beef slices were over cooked, and way too overpriced. Average price of pho even in sf is like $8.. this bowl was like $11.  Tom yum Ca - something like that.... it's the Tom yum with coconut milk and chicken. Tell me why it tastes like they used vinegar to make it sour when they're supposed to used something like tamarind. Tasted like drinking vinegar ....  Definitely did not like their food. Came here because of the good reviews but was very disappointmented. You will be better off somewhere else",

About 45 mins later, we got a text message that said our table was ready & we went straight to the restaurant. We both ordered the same thing, which was the Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles) & we asked that it was made vegan. I got myself made with tofu, & my boyfriend got his made with mixed vegetables (basil,broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, bell peppers, & onions). I can honestly say that was the best Pad Kee Mow I've ever had. You can choose your level of spice ranging from 0-5. I chose a level 2 which is pretty spicy for me, I'm not much of a spicy/hot person & the level 2 was delicious. My boyfriend got a level 4 which was too spicy for me, however he loved it. Overall, if you are craving some great Thai food, I recommend trying this place out. You won't be disappointed.",

We ordered a variety of food, pad see ewe, Curry, Tom yum and roti desert. All were good, but the stand out for me was the Short Rib Fried Rice! Yum!!!  They have a good selection of beer.

    "text": "After several visits I have decided to take a few moments to provide my opinion about Le Thai.  This small little restaurant has created many fans on East Fremont in DTLV.  However I am still reluctant to give a five star review.  The flavors of the dishes are awesome Awesome noodle need not be explained.  I Would like more veggies in my dishes besides bean sprouts and green onions but maybe I am thinking of a different type of cuisine. The portions could also be larger especially for the hefty price of $13 a bowl.  That is almost like dining on the strip price and not the East Fremont price.    We had a few issues when it came to meal delivery and one of our dishes came out well over 5 minutes after the other three.  Also the first one came out and the temp was a little cold like it had been waiting in the window while the other two were being prepared.  I give this kitchen respect because what they do is not easy.  Cooking for a 50 seat restaurant with two itty bitty woks is not easy especially when you have a party of 10 or larger and you have three To-go orders to make, plus a full bar ordering apps.  It would almost seem impossible to make something like that happen.  I understand you have to work with what you got.  My recommendation would be kitchen expansion if possible. Take the profits from the hefty price of  Pad See Ewe and knock a hole in the wall to the Commonwealth and watch your business grow.    Le Thai has some great food and some great Happy Hour specials as well.  I will be back my rant is simply the recognition of imperfections in the operation.",

Me and my friend had a show to catch at the Strip and were in a hurry. We put ourselves on the waitlist on Yelp and it estimated the wait time of 60-80 minutes. We showed up at that time, but there were still 4 parties ahead of us. Emily at the front desk accommodated our plans for show after, and quickly arranged for a table for 2. She also let the servers and kitchen know that we need to be somewhere. The Tom yum soup, crab Rangoon and Pad Kee Mow were awesome!!! If you're ever in the downtown Las Vegas area, you MUST try this out.",

The pad Thai and noodles are so delicious! Some of the portion sizes are big enough to share with two people, which is convenient if you want to sample different dishes. They have a full bar which has many Thai beers to try. It is a good spot to visit during the summer as well because the patio area has fans with cool water vapor. I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "I have lived in Las Vegas for over 15 years and since the downtown area has started to really flourish, so have the restaurants. I was introduced to Le Thai in 2012. Fell in love with the yellow curry. I've been there at least 20x since then. Most recently, I have become a bit disappointed in their customer service and cleanliness. I stopped going for a bit after seeing a roach on the floor, but, the food was good, so I eventually returned. I went a couple of times with no incident. Then during one visit, I was sitting at the  bar and a roach crawled across the counter. I ended up getting my meal comp'd, but was a bit freaked out, so I didn't return.  Le Thai recently opened another location and I was ecstatic because I was able to enjoy their food again without fear of seeing another roach. Well, my first visit was for my birthday luncheon at work on 5/17/18. Me and all my co-workers ordered take out. I ordered the yellow curry and found hair in the dish! My other co worker found a hair in the dish she ordered by pulling it out of her mouth :( We called and told them about the hair and they offered to remake the dish, which they did, however, we were unable to go and pick it up as our lunch break was over. A co worker of mine was so disgusted, she sent an email to the manager, who basically came across nonchalant as if we were lying, even though we sent the pictures in. The manager did offer to remake the dish if we give her a head's up before coming.",

You can imagine yourself in the back alleys of Bangkok when sitting at one of their benches eating the freshly made pad Thai. Le Thai is THE downtown eatery if you want an Asian experience...  The food stands up for itself. We usually order several dishes to share and have plenty left over. They have some great cocktails too for a little preDinner drink.   All in all this place is fantastic.",

I understand that traditional Thai cooking is a bit on the drier side, but their meats are just too dry for me.  I have gone to Le Thai twice. Once was when they first opened. I had their Flat Noodle Salad and their Drunken Noodles.  Flat Noodle Salad: Very delicious, flavorful, salad was dressed well and meat was okay  Drunken Noodles: Overdone noodles with an on-the-blander side sauce  The next time, I went in for their lunch special. Their lunch special was okay. It includes a soda or tea.   We chose the   Three-Color Curry: all the curries were mixed together, so it was really only one curry color, yellow or light orange. The chicken was really dry, but it's because they don't really do anything to the meat. Perhaps it would be helpful to marinate the meat in prep, so that there would be flavor infused into the meat.   Spicy Eggplant: The pieces of eggplant were cut into big chunks, and as such, were not able to absorb the flavorful sauce that they came with. The sauce was really delicious and went very well with the rice. I chose beef for this dish. The beef was better than the chicken in terms of moisture.   Service is okay. Ambience is great. Music is awesome. Outdoor patio area is a plus. I just wish that the food was a bit better. I will be back to try their toms one more time. Until then, Le Thai is... Le Sigh...",

Walking into the restaurant off of Fremont St, you feel as if you've been transported to Thailand. The bamboo accents and warm misters are a welcome change from the dry Vegas heat outside.   The three color curry is their signature dish and a must order!! It is unlikely that you will ever have an opportunity to enjoy such a creative menu item anywhere else.   The Waterfall chicken, sticky rice and wings rounded out our order wonderfully.   Kudos to chef Dan C and his friendly staff. Dinner reservations are recommended.",

Very nicely done and it makes it a little more romantice with my gf.  Place does get crowded, but hey good food means you going to have to wait just a bit.    I came here with a group, everything was already arranged and yes it was very well presented.  We started with two apps (veggie eggrolls and wings).  Loved the wings and their dipping sauce (informed that it was just hotsauce and ranch).  The jerky with sticky rice and thai sauce, heaven.. Tiny bits of beef was very tender.  Because we were in a group the spiciness was set to mild.  Poo, I love hot stuff! Amazing noodles and pad thai were very solid choices.  I thought that it tasted just good, but could have been better if i was spicy.  Should go alone next time.  Another great entree is the chicken curry.  How good was it?  The guy across from me is a graduate from culinary school and he acutally asked for the rest of it to take home.  Enough said.    Now for you drinking folks.  There's quite a selection on thai beer from what I heard.  I don't drink, but most of the guys at the table did.  They got quite a bit that night.    Desserts! Fried bananas, a bit too much wrapping around the banana but then it works well since condensed milk is poured onto it.  Now the really appealing and interesting item was this egg cake with nutella baked.. Sorry don't remember what it was called.  Surprisingly, it wasn't really that bad once you start chewing.  I thought the egg was going to be weird but it was more like a flan with nutella.  Def will be back.  Yes I'll have to take my gf, but I want my noodles spicy!  Side note: parking is difficult, but there is street parking around the corner on both ends.  Meter parking and free after 6pm.",

While I argee with some of my peers that while some of the portions could be larger for some of the dishes, others are spot on. Definitely enjoy the ambiance and great for a quick, informal date or group get together. Some nights have a DJ playing usually some sexy house music and the last time I visited the DJ was accompanied by a gentleman playing the bongos, adding extra, organic touch to the music. Service can be spotty as the night progresses and tables begin to fill. My last time out I noticed a couple leaving in a bit of frustration as the were largely ignored.   Overall though its 3.5 but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, because unless Streats is going on its sorta slim picking for us foodies in the immediate area.

They seated us at the edge of the room where the entire wall is partially open to the bitter cold outside (so your head is warm, but your legs are freezing). Although there were heat lamps, the walls were just counter-intuitive.  I ordered the vegan curry, which I was very excited to see on the menu, AND with an option of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu. Now of course, I assumed this would be VEGAN, FAUX chicken/beef/pork, because why in the world would someone offer REAL MEAT with VEGAN curry?? Especially since I explicitly told the waitress that I didn't eat meat. So I ordered the vegan curry- chicken. Although my friend didn't like it, I thought the curry tasted fine.. until I started chewing on the meat which tasted like blood/iron and sinew so I asked the waitress who, only AFTER I ordered and tried it, let me know that it's NOT vegan. All four of us at the table were completely dumbfounded as to why anyone would offer \"Vegan Curry\" on the menu to have non-vegan meat in it?? And to not even be clear about that?? And when the waitress was told that the particular customer doesn't eat meat?? IMAGINE THAT. I don't get disturbed easily, but I was very disturbed after biting into flesh after being vegetarian for 7 years. That was $13 down the drain for me. I'm grudgingly giving 3 stars because my friends did enjoy their beef fried rice, and maybe the waitress had a long day. But all in all, what a ridiculously counter-intuitive place.",

Once seated the waitress was extremely helpful describing the dishes we were unsure of...   We ordered the Tom Yum soup & Vegetable Stir Fry.  The Tom Yum spicy factor was a 2 out of 5.. still pretty hot.. Flavor was incredible. of hot & sour with lots of mushrooms, tomatoes & chicken.   Vegetable Stir Fry with Beef was cooked perfectly, tender vegetables and plenty of meat served on your choice of white or brown rice.

    "text": "Great hole in the wall in the midst of DTLV and always a great end to a crazy pub crawl.  This place definitely has one dope atmosphere!! Although the wait could be ridiculously long at times, I prefer to sit at the back patio especially when the weather is nice out.  With the type of music they play, we always feel as if we're in DTLA every time we eat here.  Unfortunately, food quality has gone down since the restaurant first opened.  I used to think this place has the best Thai food in town but has not been the same lately.  We would frequent here for their short rib fried rice and pad Thai.  The last couple of visits, however, has been quite disappointing with the dishes being quite salty.  Nonetheless, this place has great Thai pork jerky that goes great with the sticky rice.  Their curries are also better than other places in the valley.  Just a note, spicy levels go from 1-5 with 4 being barely tolerable and that's coming from a person who eats a lot of fiery food.  As far as desserts, go for either the mango sticky rice, if available, or the roti.  Overall, Le Thai has become a local favorite due to its food, ambiance, and service.  Great place for quick lunch/dinner, happy hour, or just to sober up after being really intoxicated.",

They seem to have went with a more authentic Thai flavor versus most of the Americanized restaurants in the valley. AKA, their meals have the option for more spice and kick.   Thai Jerky, Red Curry, CHICKEN SATAY!! Of course the Pad Thai here is awesome as well regardless during lunch or dinner. Their noodles are small and stringier so they may taste different from regular Thai restaurants.  But of all things, I recommend everyone to try out the \"Waterfall Sauce\". It is spicy so I recommend not having too much of it if you cannot handle spices. Very unique!",

I tried to order Orange Chicken and our waitress kindly karate chopped the sh** out of me. From that point on I knew every employee of this fine establishment would be my culinary spirit guide- leading me to rice noodle nirvana.   Don't take a hot date here, because you'll eat so much you'll look pregnant leaving the restaurant. It sets a serious tone that some people just can't handle.  Def recommend to any BevMo punk who loves them self and has taste buds they're willing to burn off in a blaze of Thai spice explosion.    But disappointed by the dessert menu.",

And they have a patio! !!!! So, the Massaman curry actually is vegan, and it's delicious.  As are the Awesome Noodles, which totally live up to their name.  Just remember to ask for your dish with no fish sauce or egg.  The spring rolls were quite good as well.  Wash it all down with my favorite new drink, the Lady Boy (Thai whiskey with gingerale and lime).  They also have a rum-based drink that tastes EXACTLY like grape kool-aid.    It is very small inside, but has a good sized patio.  This will be a wonderful place to eat for the 3 weeks a year that vegas is neither too chilly or blazing hot.  Kidding! I'm a trooper, sort of.  And they have heat lamps out there now, so really just do it.    The menu is small, but everything is tasty, so who cares?  I can't wait to get back and more things.   This is a really great addition to downtown, and a much needed source of vegan-friendly late night eats.",

First off, this is a terrible way to treat a customer. Your food is over spiced, I didn't like it, and you double charge me. If I could give you a ZERO I would for poor customer service and lack of class. Never eat here again. I eat Thai food all the time and your food sucked.

I ordered them as spicy as they dared to make it, and while I waited for my order, my friends offered me some of the rice they ordered, which was fried up with some short-ribs... (hmm that's new..) It ended up tasting pretty good actually, and had just a little bit of heat to enhance its flavor.  I sat at the bar with my friends who are regulars there, and once my food came out I dug in.... WOO.... there was the heat, and spicy it certainly was. Nothing eye-watering for me.. but I'm sure it would be overwhelming for others. The heat, the pork, the noodles... it was good. The noodles itself didn't seem to taste very authentic Thai, but I figured I can't really base the restaurant off of something that seemed to be more a house specialty.  Good service, kind folks, and a fairly crowded environment most of the time. Combie that with good food? yup... I'd say it was a nice visit and good enough for me to come back if I'm in the area again... (which will probably be like, next year)",

    "text": "This place has gotten too big for its britches.  Since opening, prices have gone up (fine) and quality has slipped (unacceptable)--mostly a consistency issue.  All that said, it's still delicious and really hits the spot when you've been drinking the last few hours at the downtown bars.  Unfortunately, the dreaded 45 minute wait has become far more consistent than the food.  This would almost be tolerable if not for the fact that there are multiple counter seats open with literally nobody waiting out front every single time.  And the hostesses are almost always rudely flippant about it..  And they don't take reservations for parties less than 4.  So it appears the method to getting a table if you really want one is to put your name on the list and go drink for another 45 minutes while they squander open seating waiting for everyone else doing this to come back.  As far as the food, the pork jerky, pad kee mow, shortrib fried rice, and eggplant dish are the best.  The beef soup is pretty good but always too salty.  The Pad Thai is serviceable.  Spice level is a bit inconsistent, tending on the hot side, but not really any moreso than other Thai places.  My advice to others would be to consider the dish's impact on spice, e.g. pad kee mow 3 is much much hotter than shortrib fried rice 3.",

I brought two of my Thai afficionado friends - one that's worked at an authentic Thai restaurant and another that traveled and ate her way through Thailand ----both loved it.   THe staff here is great--- I came here during a lazy saturday one day, and my gf and i sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  He gave us free shots of a thai whiskey and a BJ shot for her bday (although it might've been more for his own entertainment)   I have to qualify my review and admit that the joint is pricey compared to typical Thai food. i.e., the short-rib fried rice (savory, delicious chunks of meat) is 13$, and that's not including the fried egg you Have to get on top. I believe most curries are around 10$ if you're getting regular meat, closer to 13$ if you get shrimp.   That said the food is good enough that i've came here twice in 1 day... albeit drunk the second time.   However, you're guaranteed to have a flavor packed dish And their cocktails are legit. They have great, refreshing fruity-but not overly sweet drinks...i.e., Hendricks cucumber martini (so cucumbery but has a bite), Thailup (Thai style Mojito made with tamarind), and a Pear-tini, sounds super girly, but my bf got it and loved it. HA!   Even better they're open til 2am and the food makes for amazing drunk munchies.   Not to mention you have great establishments just across the street, i.e., Downtown cocktail room.",

Ga pow- a good portion of meat and the texture of the pork was tender and not gritty. White rice compliments the dish perfectly, but on it's own can be a little too salty 2. Pad Kee Mow- very flavorful dish with tender noodles and meat. My only complaint about this dish is that there wasn't enough noodles in proportion to the rest of the dish 3. Short rib fried rice- so tasty but again a little on the salty side. But if you mix some white rice with it and add some thai chilies the dish is great. 4. Pad Thai- it was a little too tangy and where were the peanuts? I love the peanuts normally on this dish. I felt a little sad that it wasn't what I expected 5. Mango Sticky Rice-Delish!! The rice wasn't too sweet or too sticky but where's the mango?! Such a small portion of mango for $6.50....can't you charge $7 and give me more mango???  Waiter Dino was very nice When he noticed we were waiting for a while he made sure to let us know  The girl in the front seemed snooty but after we talked her up a bit she was a tad more friendly...and by tad I mean I wasn't going to pull her hair from behind just to be like, who did that?!   Anyways, this place was good Come when u aren't hungry Bc by the time you get the food you will be starving  Good tactic Le Thai... Touche",

Great environment to stop by for a dinner during Vegas trips. The Thai food here is authentic, yet modern and original. Their \"Amazing Noodles\" are sincerely amazing and a delicious up from the popular Pad Thai dish. A must try is also the Beef Short Rib Fried Rice. It's sweet yet savory and compliments all the other spicy, family style Thai dishes. The Red Curry and Eggplant Tofu was so rich and the sauces had just the right amount of spice (we got medium). As with all Thai restaurants, they're not joking when they say something's spicy so be cautious!  I especially loved he outdoor seating with the patio lights and side bar. Perfect place for a Thai tea, Thai beer, and hearty comfort food away from the overplayed chain restaurants.  The lasting impression? \"A hidden gem off the Strip and a must try in Vegas.\"",

Located downtown in a perfect location for tourists and locals, Le Thai is one of the tastiest meals at very reasonable prices you will find.  Truth be told, Karen and I have eaten at Le Thai several times, but certainly wanted to write a review today. Our most recent visit was for a mid-week lunch. For those that haven't been, you should usually expect a wait of some sort to be seated. Le Thai does a good job of flipping tables in a timely fashion, so the wait shouldn't be too long. However, do note that you can book your spot in line using the \"No Wait\" app. It's easy to download, sign up and be in line even before you get to the restaurant.  Once we arrived at Le Thai, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. The decor and vibe are really comfortable and service has always been good for us. During lunch and happy hours, you do have alternate menus to look at if you desire. However, both Karen and I knew what we wanted and ordered off the standard menu.  Karen loves the Short Rib Fried Rice and ordered it with zero spice on this trip. I myself went with the Garlic Chicken Fried Rice at a 2 spice. Both dishes are fair portions (Karen always brings a little home while I don't leave a spec of rice on my dish). I have a crab/shellfish allergy, so when Karen orders the Crab Rangoon like she did on this visit, it's all hers!  For those that want to grab and go, we have ordered carry out a couple times and Le Thai makes that experience easy as well.",

This is a big deal because this place is tiny and super popular.   You can sit outside, at the adorable patio or inside if you prefer. This time of year is perfect for outdoor dining so I take full advantage of it. The music they played was similar to my own playlist of funky, cool and International vibes and I loved it.  Service was attentive and friendly and thanks for the complimentary Thai ice tea! It could have been sweeter for my tastebuds but it was still very smooth & refreshing.   We ordered the red curry chicken lunch special which was spicy and very flavorful and the Thai chicken fried rice which was some of the best I've tried. The eggs had a sweet note to them and I loved that they added tomatoes and cucumbers to the mix.  The crab rangoons were delicate and perfectly molded and also tasted great.   Overall the vibes in here were a lot of fun and we enjoyed ourselves. They do offer lunch specials and happy hour so that's a great time to try them to see if you're into it.",

    "text": "The space is cozy and the ambiance is nice, but there were a couple of missteps during our experience here today that knocked my rating down to a 3. First of all, when we arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday we were told it would be a 30 min wait for a party of 6, so we went to another store to buy something. 6 minutes later while we were in the middle of making a purchase, we get a text that our table is ready and had to hurry back. I don't mean to complain that a 30 min wait became a 6 min wait, but the time discrepancy seemed quite large at the time and threw off our plans.   Second of all, the timing of the service was a bit off. 5 entrees came out simultaneously, but our 6th friend had to wait an additional 10 minutes before his dish came out, leading to an awkward wait time for everyone at the table.   The food was quite good, although it didn't blow me away, especially since prices were on the expensive side (at least compared to Boston). My favorite dish was the beef pad see ew ($13), which has thick tender noodles covered with savory soy sauce and large slices of beef. I do wish that the pad see ew also included scrambled egg though, which would have made it more delicious. My partner got the chicken pad thai ($13), which we did not really enjoy. Instead of the peanut flavor we were expecting, the entire dish had a strong cilantro flavor that was almost overwhelming.   Remember to check in on Yelp for a free 12oz Thai iced coffee with your meal! Our server was very nice and attentive, and honored the Yelp checkin for our entire table. He was even nice enough to give us the option between a Thai iced tea or iced coffee.",

So, i LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy food and can definitely handle the heat. While ordering, the server kept trying to tell me that 5 is really spicy. I didn't care.. I want it! Alas, I think the server didn't believe me. Food came, and it was not spicy at all. Either their spice level sucks, or the server took it upon herself to change my spice level so that I wouldn't send the food back for being spicy. Ugh. Whatever. Anyway, food was good for sure. Is it worth the the trek to Downtown LV? Nah, not really. There's other equally great places in LV for Vegas locals (think, Weera Thai or I Am Thai), where you don't have to fight hipsters for a seat.   The pork jerky was good, the sauce it came with was yummy. If I ever make it back here, might get the beef short rib fried rice. I keep hearing about it. Curry had good flavor, but like I said, I wish it was the right spice level... GIVE ME THE FIRE!!!  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I ever crave Thai food while Downtown, this is the place.",

But... that being said my friend didn't think it was anything special at all.  I guess it boils down to your tastes and expectations.  If you're coming in looking for a super traditional Thai restaurant you're going to be disappointed.  Although they don't seem to market themselves this way, I would say that they food has a more modern approach.    We came in for lunch around opening on a Friday afternoon and we didn't have to wait but be prepared to wait because it definitely got crowded as time went by.  There were a good 5 groups of people waiting when we left the restaurant.    The lunch special is good for the price point.  We ended up ordering one item from it and a few other items off the menu.  Fair warning, the portion sizes are bigger than they seem so we ended up with a lot more food than we anticipated.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  I cannot wait to come back in to try other items.    They have a very cute and funny drink menu so I wouldn't mind coming in for dinner to have a cocktail as well.  The service was quick and friendly.  Overall, great experience.",

    "text": "My bf and I were staying downtown and were looking for a good, hearty meal after our evening flight into Vegas. I had heard good things about Le Thai, and surprisingly they were one of the only places downtown still serving food at 10pm. There was about a 20 minute wait, and despite the 105 degree heat and having to wait outside, the hostess pointed out the fact that we could order drinks and water from the window while we waited for a table. Score! I had the My Thai and bf had a stout. We were called in earlier than we had anticipated and got seats at the bar. I ordered the pad see ew and bf had the pad kee mow, both with tofu. I ended up having the smoky old fashioned and it was great! I'm not even usually a whiskey drinker. The food was great and we followed it up with mango sticky rice. Did I mention the portions are HUGE? We'll totally go back the next time we're in Vegas and I'll be sure to try the waterfall sauce next time. It'll be dangerous to go there when it's more than an hour before close! I'm still craving the mango sticky rice.",

Since the last time we came they remodeled and I LOVE the new artwork. Definitely check the spot out and although that nice \"outdoor\" feel isn't present anymore, I think its a definite improvement. I really really recommend that three color curry. It's an amalgamation of the red, yellow, and green curry and it's REALLY good. We even got it over Pad Thai noodles for an extra $1 and it was enjoyable although I think I prefer it over rice. The happy hour and lunch menus are the best, and I recommend getting the chicken wings and Pad Prik.",

    "text": "I have been eating at Le Thai for the past 2 years. The food has always been great as well as the service. I've never felt the need to review this place before until last night. You can see they have new employees as I've stated I've  been going here for 2 years. Last night my BF friend and I came in sat down at the bar at about 10:15pm. There were two other sitting at the bar as well finishing up their meal. I won't name names because I don't like doing that so I will say the female bartender took our drink order then we waited and waited. 15 minutes later the male bartender had to re take our order. So about 20 minutes now we finally received our drinks and we ordered our food. The food is always great so no complaints there this is strictly a review on their customer service. The bartenders were rude inexperienced and continued to have an attitude not only with us but the people that kept coming to the side window to order from the bar. The female bartender at one point actually closed the window on someone who was asking her questions about the menu! Unprofessional all the way around. Every time we placed an order they would do 100 other things including checking their cell phones and then remember what we ordered when they would turn and see our faces.. We finally got out of there around  1140 or so and that's because the male bartender of course forgot to put in our order for the fried banana's. Oh and the best part they gave us the wrong bill which was WAY lower than what we ordered. Guess they got ours mixed up with all those window orders they were mad about taking! Lol we usually would of brought the mistake up to the manager when this situation happens however based on their horrible customer services skills and not paying attention to what they are doing because they wanted to complain the whole time they deserve to have their register short and get reprimanded about it. I'll be back to Le Thai because the food is great but we'll take a table next time of the same bartenders are there.",

The other reviews led me to believe that this was THE place to get good Thai in Vegas....and we were dying for good food, given that Vegas Thai and Chinese on Ogden had closed (boo).    The wait was two hours...which was spent in the Griffin (see review), so that was fine.  Once seated (outside...it was heated, so that was fine too).  The Tom Ka Gai came out and it was absolutely perfect, so hopes were set high for a great meal.  Sadly, everything else out of the kitchen was just bland dreck.  We ordered every dish Thai native spicy...it came out like baby food.  When we mentioned it to the wait staff, we were told that this is their 'spicy.'  Honestly, it was the blandest, least flavorful mundane crap they could have slung on a plate.  The chicken was dry, the curry was just an overcooked orange mess.  BLECK.  DO NOT buy into the hype - you are better off at Denny's.",

    "text": "So there is a big buzz going around about the food at Le Thai and how great it is and after reading they were just put on the list of 50 best restaraunts by Eater Vegas I thought I would try it myself. So on Friday night I ventured downtown and entered Le Thai. Now for me I was going honestly just to find out if all the buzz was right and in order to compare one Thai place to another there is only one dish that stands out and that is  the pad thai noddle dish. First I was escorted in and sat down on there patio against the wall. This seating shouldn't even exist in my opinion but I understand that you work with what you have available. My server was very pleasant and busy and wasted no time in bringing over there \"menu\" (an incredibly dirty table tent looking thing). I knew what I wanted so I ordered the pad thai noodle dish at a level 4 and a bottle of sake. This is where things get interesting.. Not even 1 minute later the server brings out my bowl of pad thai and hands it over to me. The dish looked like it had been in a blender with everything kind of just thrown together. It was room temp with absolutely no level 4 spice to it. Now since I have been working in the food service industry all my life I came to the conclusion that they must have a giant pot in the back of pad thai noodles and whenever one is ordered you are basically getting a scoop hence the dish looking like \"family meal\" rather then a cooked-to-order dish worth the $11.50 they are charging. If you are in the mood for some amazing Thai food then I would recommended Archie's Thai restaraunts. It's cheaper and the quality of food is ten times better! Now I know that the buzz is more about supporting downtown business rather than food and the same can be said about the 50 top restaraunts list by Eater Vegas.",

    "text": "In looking for restaurants with both high ratings and a close proximity to my downtown Las Vegas hotel, I found some reviews for Le Thai and decided to check it out. Damn glad I did too, because it was easily one of the best Thai food experiences I've had! With both vegan and meat lovers fare, this cute and highly energetic restaurant is a hipster bar (they had great music playing throughout my meal), an outdoor garden (the back patio was being used for a private event, but it's lovely and worth the trip to eat outside) and an excellent Asian restaurant all in one. I had the Chicken Larb and it not only tasty but generously portioned. The Thai iced tea was HUGE and they offered me a refill! THAT certainly doesn't happen at any of the Thai restaurants in Metro-Detroit. The local alternative newspaper was available so I sat at the bar - they have two, one specifically for drinks and the other which faces the kitchen - and looked for things to do downtown. Despite the reviews which say the service is just so-so, my servers were both incredible: friendly, funny, absolutely attentive and helpful with suggestions. An addition to the not-so-common atmosphere, the full bar has so many cocktail choices, you'll be hard-pressed to pick just one - it IS Vegas, after all. And any place with a \"Ladyboy\" cocktail is a keeper in my book!",

Small inside dining with a larger outside seating area in the back.  The restaurant is very rustic and mimics what you may find in Thailand The place was filled which was a good sign for almost 9pm at night.  We took a few seats at the bar and ordered.  My wife always gets the beef massaman curry wherever she goes and it was amazing, great levels of flavor.  I got the special which was a beef fried rice, it was one of the best meals I have had in this town!  We have found our favorite Thai place in Las Vegas.",

Long story short, we walked up to this place, pretty much a hole in the wall, but because of yelp we decided to give it a try.  My group consisted of a 48 y/o (Me) a 40 something two obvious teenagers, a four year old, and lastly my 10 year old.  None of the kids can drink or gamble:)  It's about 107 in the shade, but hey we want the teenagers to try Thai food for the first time.  She looks at all of us and asks for our email and says 30 mins.  ok fine.  45 mins. later we get a text, cool!  Let's eat!  Get there, \"Oh you can't go inside because of the kids\".  WTF!!!!!!   You want me to eat hot spicy thai food with a four year old in the hot vegas sun!  What a nut cake!.   Needless to say we turned and walked away, never to return.  After reading a few more reviews I could see a bunch of bad service problems and a lot of so so food reviews.  I usually don't take the time to do this, but this was something else.  With all the great asian  food places in Vegas, I'm sure there are some great Thai places I can find.",

Although this place is really small and you can practically be apart of the conversation of the people at the table next you I still did enjoy my meal. I ordered a Thai Ice Tea which I didn't see on the menu but was happy that they had it. It was good but not great. Could have been a little sweeter. As for the food we ordered the pork jerky whit sticky rice. The sauce this dish came with was incredibly delicious. Tangy, Spicy, and lots of cilantro. We also order the garlic beef fried rice which was also delicious and full of flavor. Everything on the table was level 3 from 0-5 on their spice meter and in my opinion was just the perfect amount to make me have to take a few sips of water and want to come back for more until it was all done. Next time I'm on this side of town I will definitely be coming back here.",

With that said, I like to come here for special occasions because I liked the food and atmosphere so much.  After my last experience, it will be my last trip.  Ordered the chicken pad thai as spicy as I had the 3-4 times prior (Spicy level 3).  Food came and it felt like a level 10.  Told the waitress that this was a lot spicier than I've ever had and she said I should have asked her about the peppers.  She went on to explain that the peppers are new every two days and sometimes they can be extremely spicy and sometimes not.  Apparently I got a super spicy batch.  She did not offer to remake the food, discount the food etc, simply put the blame on me for not asking about the peppers.  Wasn't satisfied how we were treated so I asked a busser who was cleaning off our table if we could speak to a manager.  He went and got the manager and she was the one who was serving us!  Thought about emailing the general manager about our experience, but sharing our experience would be more helpful to other people considering this restaurant.",

It tastes good but these dishes done properly should.  Also, because Thai food generally tastes good when you are drunk or hung (the perfect combo of grease, salt and carbs), it serves the target demographic well. Not trying to be negative - I've had several perfectly fine meals here - just giving a realistic assessment.  Sober diners and those who know food should adjust expectations accordingly.  On the plus side, service has always been great.",

The problem was despite the heat, the salad was so good I couldn't stop. Call me a masochist. I will order my salad at an 8 instead of a 10 next time. Le Thai is awesome.",

It was chilly when we went so we sat inside. Everyone has been raving about this place to me so of course we had to try it. We went for happy hour which was great because we got to try a few things for much cheaper. We sat and had beers and we first tried the Thai BBQ Wings which were AWESOME. They have this amazing sriracha chili ranch dip, WOW! I loved them. Then we tried the chicken skewers which came with a peanut sauce, they were also awesome, but the sriracha ranch was SO good I kept it to dip the chicken skewers in! To finish off the evening we tried the chicken panang curry, which is our favorite thai dish and it was good. It wasn't the BEST curry I have ever had but I liked it. I would definitely recommend this place, but make a reservation beforehand. Since we went so early we didn't have to wait, but I have been told to make a reservation because the place gets packed. Considering they had a ton of employees, I assume this is True. ENJOY!!!!",

The outdoor seating area in the back is cute, however, it could be more visually appealing. The 'Lady Boy' cocktail was decent, a bit light for the price, but worth trying once. The 'Pork Jerky' appetizer was yummy, and the waterfall sauce is a must try! The 'Awesome Noodles' were indeed awesome, however if you are not one for sprouts, you may want to steer clear as there were more sprouts than actual noodles. The tofu was wonderful, lightly fried and flavored appropriately. The service was moderate, and the food arrived to the table quickly. The place seemed to fill up fast, so an early dinner is best.",

You can eat out back open air too - very misty- but twas hot so we ate inside. I think they DJ music at night there too- very happening.Traditional pad Thai, chick skewers, pork jerky lots more... veggie and other healthy tidbit as well. I cant wait to try some more. Yum. Joint is run by cool hip kids (to me anyway).  Very polite. Area is a little crusty but places like Le Thai will eventually replace the luster the area once had. Go there to eat.

Two tables who ordered after us received food before we did. I love Thai food but would never EVER try this horrible example of customer service ever again.",

    "text": "Are you kidding me? 5 stars, these people must not eat much Thai food. I've read so many positive reviews about this place we (1 Thai, 1 Cambodian, 1 Chinese and 1 American) finally stopped in to try for ourselves. Wished we hadn't. A 15 minute wait for a table was no problem but having to ask the staff to wipe down the table because of sticky residue was a bad start. We ordered Yellow Curry, Ga Pow, Short Rib Fried Rice and Pad Thai all with chicken, except the fried rice, and degrees of heat from 0-5, 5 still needed more heat. All the chicken in all the dishes dry. The Pad Thai smelled like a wet dog and was overly soggy. The Beef Fried Rice tasted exactly the way my wife makes it using canned corned beef. The Yellow Curry was okay but the dry chicken made it less appetizing. We asked ourselves why is this place so expensive when other places charge 50% less for better quality? And $4 for a soft drink, what gives? For us the #1 Thai restaurant is Lao Thai Kitchen on N. Nellis. Their Saturday lunch buffet for $7.99 has far better tasting dishes like Pad Thai, Ga Pow and Yellow Curry along with chicken wings, Beef with Broccoli, Larb, Green Beans and others. Bonus, kids eat free. But don't take my word for it, go compare for yourself.",

I wasn't a fan of the Som Tam. I ate Som Tam every day for months in Bangkok and it's one of my favorite foods. This one was missing something, it didn't have the balance of spicy, sour, salty, savory, and sweet. It just tasted like spicy papaya - it needed more fish sauce, lime, peanuts, and maybe some dried shrimp and palm sugar. I liked that it came with sticky rice in a small bamboo container.  Overall I would recommend this place if you're staying downtown. Get there early because there was a wait right after we sat down, but I think there was a big party so that may be why. Service was quick and friendly, and I always like when you can see into a restaurant's kitchen - so you know it's clean.",

The place is very small and even their covered patio wasn't much bigger but where small in size, this place is huge on flavor. It was Saturday night, before six p.m. and there was an hour wait for a table because of reservations. We managed to get a seat at the 'bar' which is a small counter on the patio where there is side by side seating. The food we ordered was awesome and they had a very nice selection of imported beer. I love Singha, the more commonly available Thai beer, but I tried the Lucky Buddha beer from China, which comes in a nice Buddha shaped bottle. It was actually good beer but since I am not a frequent beer drinker, it might have been more to my taste than to others. In any event, I can hardly wait to go back again and try some of the other dishes on the menu. I will make a reservation well in advance this time.  The only reason I gave less than five stars is the wait time for a rez but solve that my making one next time.",

Don't take me wrong this place isn't a dump or anything. Very nice, but if you don't know the place you would miss it.  We walked by the place a few times a few days earlier and I missed it.  The inside is very nicely setup.  Just do you know depending on the time there might be a very long wait.  We were told about 90 minutes wait.  So we waited.  Well worth the wait.  Food was really good but damn!!!!  They give you an option of 1-5. 1 being mild and 5 is over the top.  Well it is 100+ outside so we order a 1 on everything.  Yeah it is a tradition Thai place even a 1 is a kicker.  We order a beef plate with sticky rice. That was amazing, a lot of flavor to it.  Dinner was panang curry, chicken pad Thai and fried rice.  Yeah we were hungry.  Not a bad dish at all. We ate and ate and ate.  We didn't eat everything but the waitress told us no rush if we wanted to sit and let the food settle and try again. We stayed about 10-15 minutes drinking and enjoying the atmosphere, but couldn't do it.  Not once did we feel rush.  We are so going back here the next time we are in Vegas",

I wish I remembered his name but he was great. We had the spring roll appetizer, tofu pad Thai and spicy yellow chicken curry. Everything was so good and it was was SO much food. We had leftovers that we ate later after a few drinks on freemont street. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good food away from all of the touristy stuff on freemont.",

Waterfall beef used to be one of my favorite, but the beef is over cooked today, so it was a bit hard to chew.   The services overall was excellent! Our server Jordan was very efficient and friendly.   Oh the wait list on Yelp was a BIG help so that I can be on the waiting list before I started heading over to the restaurant! ;)",

We ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice, 3 Color Curry and Pad Thai Noodles with tofu. My favorite was the Short Rib Rice, it was amazingly good!!! That could be it's own meal because of its portion size. Pad Thai was okay and the Curry was very flavorful, it also comes with side of rice. You can chose the spicy level 1-5, 3 bring spicy. We ordered a level 3 for the Curry and it was pretty spicy. Not too overwhelming but spicy. I would've rather gotten the 2 level.   We also ordered their Mango Margarita and Tamarind Margarita. They were delicious. The menu said they were $9 but we were only charged $8 for some reason.",

Each experience was in the back misted patio and every time the server was different. There was either an issue with the food, like our order being forgotten or coming out incorrect, or the service, where we weren't checked on at all and we are pretty sure there was a shift change.  What saved the day was my last experience at the bar. I was greeted immediately, had my cucumber cocktail within moments and the food was to die for. The Panang Curry with tofu was my favorite of the meal and the Pad See Ewe noodle dish with beef was equally amazeballs. They don't hold back on the spice level and even two stars was a tick hot for a wuss like me. I like my food spicy in flavor but not so hot that it feels as though my mouth is an erupting volcano. I didn't care for the fried spring rolls as they were a touch too greasy for me.  This bar experience saved my previous 1-star experiences so the bar is where you will find me next time. And if the bar is full I'm ordering to-go.",

Noodles were perfectly cooked and the flavors blended really well.

Highly recommend, my only suggestion is for wait staff to be transparent about seating. We were told to wait 30 min, called in 10 and when we sat down the entire back area was empty.",

The spice levels could be better explained; I can usually handle some medium spice, the options were 1-5, so I chose 2, and it was still too damn hot. Lmao not horribly, but my throat and lips were tingling. To top it off, since your right next door to a bar that has a space for live bands, expect your dinner to get loud, like you can't hear the person next to you loud.",

This place was Cameron's favorite spot. He took everyone here and had his favorite order. My brother has many fond memories here with him so when we were in town for Cameron's funeral many friends thought it would be special to eat here in his honor. After a day of grieving and a funeral we went here, knowing it would probably be a 2-3 hour wait but that it would be worth it. Another friend who was with us told the hostess our situation. She put us on the list and we went to Container Park to kill some time. An hour later a table was ready for us (far shorter than the normal wait). We were so grateful to the staff for making our last minute plans work. That is wonderful service.  The food was equally as wonderful as the service. Best Thai food I've ever had. Each dish was full of flavor and great to split with friends. The drunken noodles were delicious, the fried rice was perfectly cooked, and the soup was full of unique flavor that I loved.   This place is now on the must visit list each time I go home to Vegas. Thank you, Le Thai for the best way to honor a friend!",

My go to dish at Thai restaurants is the beef pad see ew, so I had to get it. Noodles were perfectly cooked and pan fried with the yummiest sauce. There was far too much beef for my liking in comparison to the amount of noodles received though, especially as I didn't think it was the highest quality beef. Overall still a top notch dish. In addition we HAD to get the short rib fried rice. Oh my god. I normally don't like to order fried rice at restaurants but this is a must. So worth it!",

The Hostess, after sending her emergency text messages and clearly pretending to be busy, indicates that there will be an additional 35 minute wait for our table, a party of seven.    We are locals and have been going to Le Thai for years, this is a typical situation.  We arrived to learn we will need to wait an additional 35 minutes, outside in 30 degree weather, while they slowly and methodically move two of the Ten empty tables together to accommodate us.  This makes a total wait time of 1hour and 20 minutes. Listen folks, this was a Sunday night!!!  I am disgusted and insulted by the treatment at Le Thai.  This is no way to operate a business. I do not plan to patronize this establishment ever again.   There are plenty of good Thai restaurants in Vegas, Save the aggravation and head around the corner to La Comida, where you at least someone will make and effort to serve you food and drinks on the same day your arrived.

    "text": "Le Thai is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.   FOOD: I haven't been disappointed yet. I like to start every trip with the Pork Jerky. It's pieces of pork are cooked till crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. It's served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce, which is fabulous in it's own right. A vinager based sauce that will make your glands very very happy. You mix them all together and you have an appetizer that does not disappoint.   I'm ashamed to admit that I've tried nearly every dish on the menu but I can't help but keep going back to the Pad See Ewe and the Pad Thai at a spice level 3. The soy sauce based sauce on the Pad See Ewe makes this dish rich and flavorful. If you're looking for something lighter, I would go with the Pad Thai, unlike most Pad Thais, this dish leans more towards the fresh and citrus side of things rather a red pepper / chili sauce. You won't have Pad Thai like this anywhere else, at least I haven't found it.   Oh, and who can be upset with a Thai Coffee?   SERVICE: Service is the only reason Le Thai doesn't get a 5 star rating. It's very touch and go and times. There have been visits where the service is impeccable, they are friendly and attentive; other times not so much. It's a toss up, but the food always comes out delicious so I can handle a mediocre experience from time to time.    AMBIANCE: Le Thai isn't a large place but I've never felt crowded, I prefer outside seating. It's heated in the winter and cooled down in the summer so it's always comfortable. Being downtown has it's perks because there's often a wait to get seated, but it's a quick stroll to container park or Fremont Experience so there's plenty to do while you wait.",

    "text": "As we walk in, my fiance exclaims \"This place must be legit, they have katoys working here.\"  Aside from his comment, this place is legit in terms of food, but not legit for the wait time. So you can call in and put your name on the wait list and they call you or use the NoWait app. I was told and texted 15 min wait, but ended up waiting 30 minutes before I headed over to the restaurant to make sure we weren't being shafted.  Word of advice...we showed up and there were at least 4 open seats for a party of 2....big fail Le Thai.  The chick at the front needs to get on top of it when it comes to texting parties when tables open up. We probably didn't need to wait at all, but we trusted they were going to text us.  Okay, so lesson learned there.    Onto the food, this is what gives them the 4 stars.  We ordered:  1. Pork jerky with sticky rice and waterfall sauce: Fried pork that is moist (not like jerky) that is sweet/salty with a citrus dipping (waterfall) sauce, I mean this is close to perfection.  I can probably eat this as a meal by itself!  2. Thai wings with sriracha ranch: fish saucy in taste with a hint of sweetness, fried to a dark brown color...the flavor is so intense inside these wings and outside that it definitely does not need the sriracha ranch.  I ate the wings without the sauce and it was amazing, my favorite dish by far! I was upset my fiance didn't sacrifice and give me part of his share of wings.  3. Short rib fried rice: this dish may have been over hyped by past reviews, while good, not amazing that I would pay $13 for fried rice again.  It was good fried rice, but maybe a little overly sweet because of the short rib pieces.  It didn't end up being spicy enough to balance out the flavor of the short rib.  I will admit I was biased against this place, since I figured it was mediocre Thai food meant for tourists...but it was definitely comparable to the other Thai places in Vegas.  A little bit pricier but that comes with the territory.",

I had the Tom yum Gai and Panang curry, the soup was perfect, not greasy and very flavorful. The Panang was delicious. But my favorite in the curries is the 3 curries  WATCH OUT! This place can be very addictive. I'm used to spicy and had asked for a 5 thai spicy it's hot but edible. But it had a good zing for minutes... It's worth visiting. I'll be back for sure.",

You can get on the list and they'll text you. No shortage of bars within walking distance while you wait. I'm not sure how long a larger group would actually have to wait. It seems like it would take forever. Word of advice, ditch the friends and eat solo if you have to or pick your favorite friend and share the goodness with a table for two.  It used to be relatively intimate and nice to have a conversation now, commonwealth is so unbelievably loud, my noodles were shaking to the beat of their bass. The food is worth it, it's ok.  I've gone with vegan and vegetarian friends who were perfectly satisfied.  In a world with chain restaurants and sauces piled atop mounds of mostly inedible goop, it stands apart with real flavors that taste like food....fantastic food!",

Le Thai is doing unique things with their food preparation that results in genuinely delicious food.  Service was friendly and efficient, the ambience in the back outdoor dining area was comfortable with a great relaxed vibe.  I'll definitely be going back when I get back to town.   I was posting some additional reviews today and decided to see if any prior postings needed updating.  I clicked on the \"My Reviews \" button and am glad I did as I had forgotten my Sept 2016 1-star review of Le Thai.    I suggest fellow Yelpers periodically check their previously posted reviews to see if any need updating based on a more recent visit.",

The staff is wonderfully friendly...even when they are slammed...what else would you expect from a place with the visionary prowess to offer free hugs with a Yelp Check-in?    Most of their dishes are above average.  I usually go with curry dishes when I'm here because there noodles are a little less consistent and have been over cooked a couple of times.  The bottom line for me is that you are paying a little more because of the location, but there is not a single item I have tried that I don't enjoy more at another Thai restaurant in town.  The food is certainly good enough for me to stop in if I am on East Fremont though.  They have an enclosed patio in the back that is delightful when the weather is nice and heated well during colder times...avoid it in the summer though.  The shade is not enough to keep the temps down.  Come here if you're on East Fremont and in the mood for Thai. Come here if you have had too much to drink and need a bite while you sober up...their hours are certainly accommodating to the drinking crowd. Come here when you are lonely and need to cash in on the free hug!",

A hidden gem of a restaurant, this place is cozy, unique and conveniently located if you are visiting the downtown area.  Despite having a small menu selection, especially when compared to other Thai restaurants in town, everything I have tried is extremely fresh and tasty. Without further ado, let's review my visit  Service: The seating was prompt and the staff was upbeat and helpful. We were seated promptly and servers checked in with us often to make sure our meal was perfect.  Food: Probably as authentic as it gets for Thai food in Las Vegas. Here are the menu items I would recommend:  * Spring rolls: Golden, crunchy and tasty, these rolls are fried to perfection. Along with their sweet and sour sauce, these rolls make for a perfect start to your meal.  * Waterfall beef: Delicate and tender, this beef appetizer is enough to be an entree. Mixed with a ginger-based sauce and accompanied by waterfall dip sauce (tangy/citrus and salsa like) and sticky rice, this dish will have you coming back! Full transparency... this dish was a bit on the salty side, so keep that in mind when ordering it.  * Pad Thai: Amazingly fresh and packed with flavor, this Pad Thai has been the best I've had in town.  * Panang Curry: Probably the reason I gave them 4 stars. I like to eat spicy food, but ALL of their curries are too spicy for me to finish. I was a bit disappointed because the taste of the dish was heavenly, but apparently there is no way for them make it less spicy than a level 4.  Enjoy!",

Really..the only downside to this place is that it's rather small and so there's almost always a sizable wait at peak times. I like the service, the decor is not out of this world but always makes me comfortable and the food is solid. The menu is short and sweet and a large number of dishes can be made vegetarian. We like their spring rolls, tom yum soup, ginger fried rice, massaman curry, basil noodles and awesome noodles.   The drinks menu is pretty solid with some interesting cocktail concoctions and Asian beer options. I'm a happy camper that Le Thai is here in Vegas and adding to the downtown scene!",

You can see the kitchen from the main dining area and the outdoor seating area has a great feel to it. The bamboo is a nice touch!  2. Their short rib fried rice was superb. I also love getting a mixed vegetable stir fry with chicken - it sounds simple but the flavor is unreal. Oh, and the peanut sauce they serve with the chicken satay...mmm!!!  3. Every time I go there has been a wait, but I assume that is because it has been peak lunch hour. I really don't like waiting around - but this place is awesome because they take your number and text you when your table is ready! (My newest tradition for the longer waits is to go across the street to Park for a quick drink at the bar while I wait).   4. Their lunch special is great if you are in town at the right time. For $9.95 you pick a dish and a drink - great combo.   5. Their portions are perfectly sized. They are not overbearing at all!    Not my favorite:   1. The service. I asked several questions about dishes on the menu, but for some reason the server did not understand what I was asking. I also asked for my dish sans mushrooms...low and behold - mushrooms came! Another time my drink never came and the portion size was incorrect. This is something that can be improved on obviously - so it doesn't bring down my overall rating that much!",

    "text": "So this place has a ridiculous amount of reviews but I felt the need to throw in my two cents. As the only thai restaurant on Fremont, this place is good. It's actually probably one of the few good places to eat (for now) on E. Fremont. Their curry is actually pretty good, but the rice and noodle dishes are inconsistent from sweet to salty and it always seems like they oversaturate these plates with oil. Plenty of amazing things to try BUT with that being said this place is so ridiculously overhyped. I don't know if it's the drunk Roberto's effect or the \"wow Panda Express is the best Chinese food\" type.   Yes this place is a must try...if you're on Fremont. But for those that have said it is the best or one of the best thai places in the city please smack the kool-aid out fo your hand and get out more. This place does not even warrant top five consideration in Las Vegas (lotus of siam, archi's, weera's, Thai style noodle house, even Pin Kaow) and that's excluding four amazing thai restaurants in Henderson. It is good, but anyone that tells you it is the best thai in the city, take it with a grain of salt.",

    "text": "Holy God!  On many previous trips to Vegas I have eaten at Lotus of Siam (another fine Vegas Thai establishment) but decided to change things up given my normal dinner hosts were unavailable this night.  Their instructions were simple- go to Le Thai - ask for Puoy (the owner) and enjoy.  I followed my instructions and gotta say I was BLOWN AWAY by this food.  The place is a trendy hole in the wall style joint... with outside dining and a really hip ambiance... As we walked in I knew I already liked it- and this was before I ordered the \"Waterfall Beef\" appetizer.  OH MY GOD this stuff is good.  I seriously want to take a bath in the waterfall sauce (except Im sure it would burn).  After this- I thought there is no way they can outdo themselves with the entrees, but with both the Pad Thai and the \"Awesome noodles\" (who doesn't love something that has Awesome in the title?) were superb.  Take a cool, fun atmosphere-  add in the most amazing flavorful beef entree (perhaps ever?), and great food on top of that and you have some serious \"winner winner chicken dinner.\"  Will definately go back. (maybe tonight?)",

I always order yellow curry on my first visit to a thai place, because I figure if they can't get the basics right, I don't need to come back to try anything else.  Plus I LOVE yellow curry.  Got it with tofu, and it was delicious!!  Ordered it mild and it had a nice, small kick to it.  Lovely flavor.  Right amount of potatoes, onions, and carrots with plenty of broth.  Also had a thai ice tea which was delicious.  I'll definitely come back to try more on the menu.  Once I experience more of the menu I imagine they'll get 5 stars.",

I guess I should have ordered the #5 Thai spicy because #4 was not all that hot for a chili head. Good flavor on both. I'd like to give the food a 4, service a 1 1/2 at best.",

    "text": "Our waiter, Darnell, made our experience horrible there. The food was also subpar. We were seated inside the restaurant by a pleasant hostess, who allowed us to have the two seat table near the window. We were seated at 1755, and happy hour ended at 1800. We ordered two regular thai teas and the chicken satay off of the happy hour special at 1759 and took a picture of proof of our order time lol. The special was $2 off of thai tea and $3 off of satay from the regular price of $4 thai tea and $9 satay. We are Filipino. Our waiter was African American, and the couple who was seated several minutes past 1800 were white. Although it was past happy hour, their waiter graciously offered them the happy hour specials. Their happy hour pork special came out before our drinks did. The waiter only brought one tea and I had to ask for the second. He charged us the regular price of $4 for the second drink, by the way. Then he took our order when he returned 5 minutes later with our second thai tea. I hated their tea because it was weak and had the grounds in it. I hate when there are black flecks in my drink. The satay finally came out and was amazing--the only positive part of our experience other than our hostess who sat us. The short rib fried rice was overcooked and tasted like old dog meat. The panang curry vegetables were undercooked (carrots, bell peppers, and bamboo shoots). I nearly choked on the bamboo shoot. We hardly ever saw our waiter, and he took over 15 minutes to bring our check. I had to repeat to him twice that I was clearly done eating  (are used napkins in the curry leftovers not enough of a visual?). My fiance had time to smoke a cigarette while waiting for the check. I had my purse on and everything and waited another 5 minutes for him to pick up the check, even though I had my card out and was waiting to tell him about the error in the thai tea charge. We decided to pay cash and I gave him a 10 cent tip, plus the 2 bucks I was overcharged. Do not eat here if you are expecting good service and food. If you are white, maybe you may have a better experience than me. Good luck, dine at your own risk. By the way, I'm half white.",

I am a fiend for spicy food, but I opt for a 3 out of 5 and depending on the peppers that day, even a 3 can be too extreme.    They have a fantastic selection of high quality teas.

The problems with my visit began the week before I even arrived.   You see, I walked by, as I often do as a downtown employee. I thought to myself... \"Oh, what I wouldn't give for some delicious Thai yums.\" When my group and I asked for a reservation, you told us it would be an hour and a half wait. You took my number. You never called. I thought you may have heard about the 3 day rule and confused my spot on the wait list with a date. Anyway, I decided to give you a second chance.  The following week, I got smart. I thought -- big group -- get a reservation. So I did. Group of 6 at noon. You confirmed the day before and again an hour before. At noon, we arrived. You made us wait outside in the 90+ degree heat for 45 minutes. Then, you only could seat 4 of the 6 of us. You asked us to wait at the table standing until the guests next to us (who had JUST gotten their food) left. Wait, what?! You want me to stare at other guests to intimidate them into leaving because you are terrible at restaurant management? You want them to give us dirty looks when you rush them out of their lunch? Then, when I mention to you that we had a noon reservation you tell me \"we are busy.\" Well, shoot. I didn't know places that were busy didn't have to honor reservations. Wait a second.... you know who else is busy, and in fact, way busier than you -- Lotus of Siam. They honor reservations and their food is incredible. Oh and making us eat our food in the heat outside without misters was super bad form, BTW.   After this hellish experience, I at least had hopes for the food, which was sadly mehhh at best. I had a rumbly in my tumbly all afternoon from your food.   So, Le Thai. I gave you a go. But, I'm breaking up with you. It's not me, it's you. Mediocre food isn't worth a headache. I hope my go-to-Lotus will take me back. But even if it doesn't, I'm still better off without you.",

It was very fortunate for us indeed. From the front it looked like a hole in a wall place. We were seated in the back room where there was a nice ambiance and music from next door. The evening was hot since its a summer time. They had these mist blowing machines on the ceiling that softly shoot out mists over the room. It felt like an reconditioned room. The food was very tasty and authentic. I know since I'm originally from Thailand.  The prices were great (inexpensive). Funny, last night my wife and I dined at a seafood restaurant in a nice casino on the main strip. I'd rather not mention the name of the place but the experience was totally different (not in a good way) and the bill for both of us came out to almost $200. I'm not complaining since this was our vacation. Our server, Jordan, was corteous and catering. He made our experience terrific. Our experience while dining at this Thai restaurant was definitely 5 Stars. Great service, great ambiance, great food and great price. I highly recommend this restaurant. I would give it 10 STARS if Yelp allows me.  This is the longest Yelp review I were wrote but this Thai restaurant deserves this review.",

    "text": "This places is really unique, it's modern decor mixed with a little touch of Asian style makes the place quite inviting. Even the sign is an eye catcher.   Once entering this place almost immediately we were seated and greeted. Loved how there was a check in for free thai tea (with a purchase of one of course), but still I love anything that could get me something free! The menu wasn't over beating, it was mostly short and concise.   I got the beef pad seeu and the bf got the beef Penang. Food presentation was awesome, and the flavors were all there. Kind of on the pricey end for me l, since I'm used to paying only $8 at thai noodle house. But for a meal that's in this area, I would say this was not bad at all.   So, if you're ever in the area and have the cravings for some Thai food. I suggest trying this place out.",

    "text": "TL;DR  + Flavor-packed Thai + Sake, although limited hot options + Friendly service  Came on a Thursday night.  Was told a twenty minute wait, but then offered a spot in the back garden along the wall seating.  No problem for me, and I actually liked the ambiance of the back garden versus the front dining area.  Server was prompt and friendly, and offered to check if their sake was gluten-safe.  The only one confirmed was the Tyku sakes (cucumber or coconut).  I know their products quite well, but even though I was not really in the mood for cold, flavored, sake - I opted for the cucumber.  Good choice.  It was refreshing with a subtle flavor that was actually quite complimentary to the heat of the entree.  Ordered the pad thai with chicken.  It had a great flavor and good amount of heat and spice (I went for 3/5).    Service was good although there was another server either taking over or helping out in the section?  That made it a bit confusing but they were both very friendly and prompt.  Price seemed a bit high for noodles and booze for two, but hey, it's LV.  Would definitely thai this place out again.",

They have a back patio area that is 10 feet away from the hustle and bustle of Fremont street, but without the noise and chaos, and they keep it shaded and cool with fans and misters in the summer. It isn't an option during the chilly winter days unless you have thick skin that can handle the cold.   The food has quality ingredients and is presented well. My favorite is the waterfall beef with waterfall sauce. It is amazing and you won't find it anywhere else. I asked them about the sauce and it is an original and they are not giving out the recipe.   The service is quick and on point, but this place is a local hotspot, so don't be surprised you may have to wait 30 min to an hour to get seated. Make reservations first, or order pick up and hope a front patio table is open. The inside dining area doesn't hold many and can get kind of cramped. The outside doesn't hold many either, but is a little more spacious and quiet.  It's not my first pick in Thai restaurants, but the waterfall beef, the location, and the ambience put it high on my list.",

The noodles tasted burnt and when I told the waitress she said it was normal and that the taste is more on the smoky side.

I've been here before in a small group and food was good just not True Thai it's too Americanized. It has all the parts just not the flavor.   For a hip, trendy hang and something super out of the box it hits it out of the park. The place is small and fills up quick being that it's quit a popular place but it is still comfy and it does it's job by transporting you straight to the market cafe/bars of Thailand. The drinks are all pretty creative and I like how everything on the menu does have a neat twist on traditional options.Warning do not go in groups of more then 10 people they have this weird rule where they force you to order family style and tack on $400 plus whatever you order. So weird and so confusing. I still don't know how they came up with that idea and how it auctual it works.   Other then that this place is very cool and food is just right if you are not looking for real real Thai. Expect to wait a while, but once you are in you won't be disappointed because overall everything is good...oh and service was 5'S our waiters were the best and the lady did worked it out with our group and owner fixed everything at the end.",

    "text": "these things stood out to me about Le Thai:  * PAPAYA SALAD:  soooo freaking good!! it only comes in two levels of spice: 0 or 4.   i dig spicy food and 4 had a nice, flavorful bite...barely enough to break a sweat, so if your faint of heart w spice, don't the the 4.    * LARB (chicken): What made this larb so nice was the distinct flavors used to make this dish. sometimes if larb is so-so, the flavors sort of run together.  Not this version. I got this w spice level 3 so it could be shared, but even that was a tad spicy for some. Just ask for the spice tray to jack it up to your liking if you're sharing.   * SERVICE: Jordan was our server and we couldn't have asked for better service. Drinks were always topped off. He read the play....on everything. Take out containers were offered (not asked for), etc. Just an awesome dining experience. Jordan, your awesome! Thank you!   * ATMOSPHERE: This place is super casual. there are a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk, 4-6 two-toppers inside, and several larger tables out back in the garden (complete w misters and fans...so comfortable!!!).  I would not recommend bringing a large group unless you are willing to split up into smaller ones. But it's worth it.   PRICING:   Larb + Papaya + 2 Thai Teas was around $24. worth every cent.   LOCATION: this is a 5 minute walk from the Golden Nugget.   Enjoy!",

Also whenever I call the server, she seems like so tired of that. I'm totally unsatisfied with this restaurant!  Reply to your comment:  I visited here on 12.21.17 at 12 pm.  First, I ordered soup with noodle. However, we got wrong roll noodles because the server didn't explain to us what types of noodles they have. So, she suggested to order additional noodle to us. At this moment, I just accepted her suggestion with patience although thats not my mistake.  Second, we ordered only one noodle for additional noodle. But she charged two noodles. Though she cancelled order finally, I feel like I'm treated as a black consumer.  Third, I requested free drink offer in yelp. At that moment, I didn't know this was one + one offer. She just brought two cups of tea without any explanation. We just paid this because we didnt pay attention to see description of this offer.  Forth, there was a woman who seems like a supervisor. Whenever we asked something to her, she said just ask to the server! Actually, thats just general question like how can I use this offer. She was just walking around tables like server. If I was her, I would deliver customers messages to the server at least.  I've never experienced such terrible service in USA. I don't know why other peoples are satisfied with your restaurant. To be honest, I feel like a kind of racial discrimination because you offered terrible service to us.  This is the first my review in yelp. I don't get any service from you guys, and never suggest this restaurant to my friends.",

They don't have their own parking so you must park somewhere downtown which usually means you're paying. I know this is the case in most big cities but in Las Vegas there are plenty of other great restaurants you can go to that are more convenient.  Wait 3/5  There's always a long wait because there isn't much seating. They also don't take reservations which is a negative for me.  Overall 4/5  I still go to Le Thai about once every couple months because the food is great but if it was in a different location, with parking and more seating, I would go much more often!",

The pad Thai was the best my daughter has ever had, and she's been enjoying Thai food and spices since a baby. No falang tastebuds here...  the Tom kha was the star of the meal, with unique flavors not experienced at any Southern California or Seattle area Thai restaurants. The green curry was also excellent with well developed flavors. The spices are \"Thai\" hot. 4 stars are a 5 in most other Thai restaurants. Nam prik mak mak. But so good.",

The waitress knew what she was doing, honored our Yelp check in deal without any hesitations. She got water without ice even without asking so she knew the Indian clientele well. She also served some nice spicy peanuts while we waited.  She was frank enough to tell us that only truly vegetarian options are massamun curry and padkemao noodles as rest of the items have fish sauce. We ordered both.  The noodles were really really tasty. The massamun curry was awesome too, perfectly cooked to the right spice level and full of veggies. Their tofu was one of the best I've had, melt in the mouth.  The only complaint is he loud music on the back patio- I would have preferred some Thai music instead of hip hop rap.  The back patio doesn't have AC but they sprayed some aerosol mist which was very refreshing. Portions were big and prices were reasonable compared to the strip. Best option, especially if you're in the Fremont area.",

The red curry has strong creamy coconut milk flavor that perfectly matches with curry paste. The curry taste little spicy but mild.

After eating fast food and pizza for the better half of our Vegas vacation I was determined to find some hearty vegetable packed food. The restaurant itself is fairly small, but they have a patio and bar area which both serve food.  The restaurant is clean and cozy with very friendly and attentive wait staff.   The food itself was very good and priced reasonably especially considering how expensive food on the strip is. I had the drunken noodles with tofu (and man do they give you a lot of tofu) which was spicy and delicious. Kendrick P had the awesome noodles which had more of a BBQ taste. Between the two the drunken noodles was the best, especially for all the vegetarians out there.  The only downside was the wait time. It took a hair longer than was expected to get our food after we ordered. But overall the food was definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "This is a nice little hole in the wall Thai place on Fremont Street, just a block away from where the street starts becoming really touristy.  The outside of this restaurant is a little too inconspicuous.  I walked by this place twice while looking for it.  There needs to be a little more signage outside.  One of the cool things about this restaurant are the dining options.  There's a walk-up window for people who want to get take out, or want to sit outside and do a little people watching while they're eating or just waiting for their order to be ready.  If you decide to eat inside the restaurant, you have the choice to sit indoors in an area right between the bar and the kitchen, or continue walking further into an outdoor area.  The waitresses here are extremely friendly.  I forgot the name of the item I ordered, but it was really good.  It was tofu and vegetables.  They asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-5, and I said 4.  The waitress said \"Are you sure?  That's pretty spicy.  Once it's made, we can't change it.\"  I assured her I could handle it.  I was able to get through my meal, but not without having to blow my nose a bunch of times because the spice level had my sinuses going.  My eyes were tearing up and my ears were on fire, but it was worth it.  I think I paid $11 for my food, which is a good deal.  The portions are quite large.   I'm always on the lookout for good Thai restaurants, and this is definitely a good one.  If you're in this part of town and looking for a nice place to eat lunch or dinner, or if you just want hassle-free take out, this is the place for you.",

He admitted that they were pretty awesome.  I had the chicken pad thai.  Woo!  Way to break me in.  3 on the spicy scale of 1-5 was SPICY for this white girl.  I loved every minute of it.   We met there right at 11:30 when they opened.  By the time we left an hour later, there was not any room to sit there.  People were waiting for our table.  This is unheard of for the downtown area.  (It was kinda funny that we ran into his mom there eating with a coworker!  Apparently, he has verbalized his love of the awesome noodles to everyone.)  I am interested in returning and sampling more of their menu.",

    "text": "Great little Thai place in East Fremont district on the south side of Fremont St. just east of the end of the Fremont St. Experience, half a block from LV Blvd. Papaya Salad was dynamite, spring rolls were tasty, especially the plum and chili diffing sauce that comes with. I had Pad Thai with fried tofu, my wife had Shrimp with Red Curry. I asked for 4 out of 5 hotness and I got my wish. Noodles were incredibly spicy and flavorful. Curry was delicious. This us regrettably a small, crowded, noisy place, especially with thw continual take-out service. Also a little pricey, but I understand that. Service was not super, but good enough for my taste. Close to a five.",

    "text": "LOVE le thai... HATE Mercy the server.  in fact...if it weren't for Mercy, this would be a 5 star review.   This review is based on our second visit and our second time having Mercy as our server...  my complaints:  -party of 5. at first we were seated indoors but were kindly asked by our original server, Olivia, if she could reseat us outside because they couldn't have underage people inside (where the bar is). understandable. no big deal. MERCY comes out of nowhere, buts into our conversation and makes a snide comment about people shouldn't have their kids out past 10. it was 930. the kid was 15 & dining with his mom. f-off. Olivia takes our order for apps and drinks so the food would be ready at the same time our new table was ready.  -Mercy gets short with us as we're finishing apps because we don't know what we want for dinner...why? because we didn't have a chance to look at the menu after we moved tables. f-off.  -then we were ignored for about an hour. thai food =spicy. you'd think our server would ask if we wanted any drinks or our water refilled. nope.   -Mercy Drops the check without asking if we'd like to order dessert...the ONLY thing we came down there was for their roti dessert. f-off.  -we finally decide to close our bill out. ask to split the check in half. so she does. literally. we present 2 cards. she runs BOTH halves of the tab onto ONE card. f-off.  ps. i never received my beverage. F-OFF, MERCY!  as for my compliments... food is delicious and reasonably priced...actually, pretty cheap compared to other Thai places AND other restaurants in general.  we tried the pad Thai, short rib fried rice (get a fried egg on top), Thai style fried rice with beef, 3 color curry, waterfall beef, Thai jerky, and chicken satay summer plate (minus the soda that never came). it was ALL yummy. we ordered everything at a 2 or 3 and it was pretty spicy but still tasty.  get the roti. i personally never would have thought to put an omelette on my dessert but it works... puff pastry, nutella, eggs and powdered sugar. super simple and tasty.",

We ordered range of dishes with varying levels of spice and shared amongst ourselves. Highlights were waterfall beef appetiser and chicken pad Thai although the rib rice dish was also sensational.   Also, garlic & chilli nuts  *drinks - singha beer, gin & tonics and mai tai",

    "text": "WHATTTTTT!!! LE THAI WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!!  Husband and I always go to commonwealth and we always say we are going to try this place because the smell is intoxicating when you are on the roof.   Well, we finally got around to trying it out. The wait was 45 mins, but they have a service that texts you when your table is ready and you can see how many parties are infront of you, VERY COOL. We didn't want to stuff our selves on our first time there since we were going out after. We shared the beef appitizer with the waterfall sauce. SHUT YOUR DIRTY MOUTH LE THAI!!!! How dare you make something so tasty. Every time we go there now we always order extra of this yumminess. For our entree we shared the awesome noodles. They are exactly that, AWESOME.   The next time we went I got the awesome noodles again because they were so good the flavors are perfectly balanced with the flavors and textures. Husband got the short rib fried rice, I had a bite or 5, haha, and had to stop myself from taking over his meal.   The service is always great, they seem to remember us at this point now, which is always a great feeling. We expect nothing fast when we go because you can't rush greatness!!! The service is the same when it's just the 2 of us and when it has been 8 of us.   OH and the price is pretty legit. When it is just the husband and I we spend under $20 when we share and under $30 when we don't.",
