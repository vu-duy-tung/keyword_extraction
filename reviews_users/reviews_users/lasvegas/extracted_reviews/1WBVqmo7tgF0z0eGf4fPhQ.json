We were starving so we tried the meatball appetizer as well.  Took half of each meal home. Also an outstanding variety of pastas available. The Gnocchi are next on the list.

Nothing we had was less than amazing and there was so much we ended up taking a lot home. The service was incredible as well. Jeremias welcomed us as soon as we walked in the door. He was so friendly and answered any questions that we had. He was more than happy to stand and talk with us and definitely added to the experience. This was our first time here but we will definitely be back!!",

Half an hour after finishing the meal I got the worst stomach cramps and threw up several times. It was accompanied by the other fun symptoms of food poisoning and I was out for 3 days. I even had a fever the second day. As amazing as it tasted I think won't be returning. It will be a while until I will have pasta again, the sight of it makes me a bit queasy right now.",

The only thing I could taste or smell were the capers. There had to be at least fifty if those very strong tasting berries. There were no herbs, no salt, and certainly no garlic. If there was, it was undetectable. After three bites, I just gave up. Sadly, the chicken was undercooked. I would understand if they had just recently opened, but that wasn't the case. To add insult to injury, with tax and tip it was almost forty dollars. As the food was to go, I couldn't even return it so that they could recook it. I was going to call and complain, but after reading other diners reviews here and the way they described managements handling of issues, I decided it would be a waste of time. I truly feel cheated. It's an awful feeling when you were expecting something else.",

You pick your pasta and then your sauce, voila!, a customized pasta dish to your liking. :P They even have a big poster with pictures of the different pastas they make - easy reference when you don't remember what's what. They also have a specialty menu if you just want to try something they put together and, even better, specials of the day! So many options, you'll definitely find something to hit the spot.   This was my second time here. I got one of the specialty menu dishes - the butternut squash ravioli with speck and mushrooms in a 5 cheese sauce. SO GOOD. I definitely recommend this dish! I mean, it was the dish that I ordered the first time that made me come back today. :) Also, they give you a plate of bread, with tomato in a bowl if you wish to add that on top. YUM! Writing this review is making my mouth water. Haha! Okay, back to the review...  Service here is amazing. The waitress and waiter are always stopping by to see how we're doing and if we need anything. It's a pretty small space for a restaurant - about 4 tables that fit 4 people (5 if they add a chair to the end) with a couple 2-seaters, if I remember correctly. Then there's also outside seating too. If you have a big group, definitely recommend calling ahead so they can put the tables together and reserve them for you. That being said, once the kitchen starts cooking a bunch of dishes, it gets a little hot inside the restaurant. Overall, definitely a spot I will be coming back to and recommend others to try!",

    "text": "Pastaidea is definitely a good idea. You want to do this, you need to do this. This is a small shop with available outdoor seating as well. The concept is simple, pick a pasta, then pick a sauce to go with it. However, the food is anything but simple. Without belaboring the point, the entrees were surprisingly delicious. Actually, some of the best pasta dishes I have had in a long while. Served fresh and hot. All said and done, our two entrees came out to about $20 each. Not inexpensive, but worth every cent. I highly recommend Pastaidea, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Not often dish out five star reviews but Pasta Idea was on point from the minute walked in the restaurant. So many five star things that love about this place! First foremost love seeing small business/family own restaurants succeed in Vegas. Pasta Idea is truly one of those spots in life.   Shout out yelp family for telling me about this great hidden gem in Vegas. As in hidden if your not looking for it probably going pass by it. It depends on the direction coming from on Lake Mead Blvd. I just about passed it myself. Pasta Idea located in tiny shopping mall tucked in the corner next to Cafe Rio. In the same area with bunch of office buildings.  They have daily special board right outside. I came for lunch with another yelper Suzy H. So best things about dining with yelpers get to try lot of food!! It was my first time Suzy H second time got the low down on the menu. The thing Pasta Idea is know for is all there pasta are fresh. FRESH!!!! Sold!! The difference between dry pasta and fresh pasta are worlds apart. Outside of the strip I have not found many italian restaurants that serve lot of fresh pasta. Am sure few do serve some but all the pasta on the menu? The thing is not just your typical common spaghetti, fettuccine, etc. Bigoli, Cavatelli, bunch of different ravioli,and even gluten free fresh pasta. Truly pasta shape for everyone. Sauces. They have bunch that can choose from mix and match with your choice of pasta. Endless possibilities of pasta heaven! They do have lot of set pasta dishes on the menu. Full menu. The appetizers ordered the Prosciutto crude and fresh mozzarella appetizer. Talk about da bomb. The prosciutto was sliced perfect nice thin slices. Really could have order pound of that just go cold cut and be content in life. The mozzarella also amazing. The freshness was on point add drizzle of olive oil and seasoning. It was the perfect starter. I ordered the Bigoli with meat sauce. It was amazing. The Bigoli was cooked to perfection combine with full hearty meat sauce. The portion size is ridiculous. Unlike chain restaurants not only full portion but packed with flavor. I was surprise finish the whole plate but it was that addicting. The price. Steal of deal. Lot of the dishes are under $20 dollars. If looking for something more affordable then going out the strip for great pasta Pasta Idea. The garlic bread with the tomato bruschetta on the side. Easily the best garlic bread had in long time. Not only is the bread hot, seasoning perfect balance not garlic garlic but clearly taste other seasonings, and bread nice toasted crust when pull piece apart yay!   Pasta Idea is tiny restaurant. Couple tables outside. I do love the art work on the walls. I love the vibe small family run business. No doubt plan on coming back because pasta combinations are endless. Delicious!!",

I chose the butternut squash ravioli with carbonara sauce and I practically licked my plate. Meatball sub was huge. Kids Mac and cheese was delicious. Hubby had lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce and was pleased.  Only downside was the decor was not up to scale with their prices. Each plate is about $15-20.   Service was very good. Friendly and courteous staff.   Will definitely be back",

    "text": "(unrelated) mother f... this is the 3rd time i had to re-write this dang review. freakin yelp didnt save it even though originally it did GRRRR  SIDE NOTE - THEY HAVE TO REMOVE THAT PastaIdea Radio. Or implement a function to turn it off. It turns back up on max volume when you change pages. UGH  ANYWAYS... this place is known for its homemade fresh noodles and sauces made in-house daily. There used to be a place on the SW side by Flamingo and Grand Canyon that had a similar feature but they disappeared only after 2 visits.   PastaIdea has a \"Lunch Special\" which allows a selection from a starred (*) noodle and matched with a starred (*) sauce for $9.95 including a fountain drink and garlic bread (Available for dine in AND take out !)   I had originally came here prior to meeting my accountant to do some taxes. I dont come to this side of town too often which was why it took me so long to visit this place. PastaIdea opens at 11am and i had came here shortly after. Located on the NW corner of Lake Mead and Buffalo, its in a small shopping center between Bucca di Beppo and McDonalds. It kind of \"hides\" in the middle of the center facing away from the parking lot but its there.   Its a small little restaurant with maybe 5 tables seating 20 people total. Since the restaurant was empty and im not one to like to dine alone, i opt'ed to take it out to eat next to the lake at Desert Shores... xD   Picking fettuccine noodles matched with arrabbiata sauce, they were both starred items which worked with the lunch special. As mentioned before, the noodles are fresh made as well as the sauces. The arrabbiata sauce is made with a spicy marinara and olives. The marinara is fresh and bright. The spice was a small kick but not as spicy as i had preferred. But for a nice warm day with a small breeze, it was nice. The fettuccine noodles were nice and al dente. The olives was a mix of green and black pitted olives and there was quite the generous amount. Having bursts of flavor from the olives with the generous amount of noodles and marinara, it was a good amount of food, especially for lunch.   As mentioned before, it comes with garlic toast and a side of tomatoes mixed with chopped basil, which gives it a very refreshing, bright taste when you put it on top of the toast and eaten together.   Second time i had came here, i had picked something not included in the lunch special (as i dont know when the next time i'd get the chance to come here, so i \"went all out in a way\"). I picked the fresh cavatelli pasta this time, which are like small long pasta shells, similar to mini hot dog buns. LOL I paired the pasta with a creamy white sauce, the Veneto, with asparagus, grape tomatoes, proscuitto crudo, and mushrooms. Proscuitto crudo is essentially the typical proscuitto you are probably familiar with. Crudo means raw whereas cotto means cooked. The sauce was SUPER heavy and creamy but worked well. Grape tomatoes cut in half punched through the heaviness fairly well. Proscuitto gave it a nice \"natural\" saltiness to the bite with the earthy taste of mushrooms. My only real complaint is the asparagus was tough to eat. Had some very tough pieces so they needed a trimming. The cavatelli pasta was AMAZING. VERY al dente with its elasticity and incomparable bite.   With the choices of 16 different noodles paired with 40 sauces, the combinations are almost endless. I would love to return to try other sauces. It does get a little pricey because of the sauce costs in ingredients they use probably, but once in a while, i think its pretty worth it.",

The food was ok, you basically create your own pasta which is nice. Our food took reallly long to to get, when my mom got her food hers was cold. I assume they weren't  expecting a busy Mother's Day.   I thought the staff was knowledgeable and very sweet. They gave all the women flowers and the mothers a special Mother's Day dessert for Mother's Day which I thought was really adorable. Yet another reason I like to support local businesses.   I don't know if I'd go back to this restaurant ...possibly if they drop the prices a bit, because I don't feel that the food was worth the price.",

They make the noodles in house and I'm a sucker for fresh pasta! Then there is a large amount of sauce choices. They also have a chaulkboard outside with specials and they do a lunch menu too.  I have a few favorites; I enjoy their pink sauce quite a bit and tend to lean more often than not to order something with it. It's definitely my favorite pink sauce out there. My two favorite combinations is fettucine with the Pink Diablo sauce (pepperoni,sausage, pepperoncini,sundried tomatoes) or pappardelle with the mushoom proscruitto cream sauce. I generally have liked everything I've ordered though! The only thing I was neutral about is the fra diavolo seafood pasta and meatballs. Their portions are hefty here so you will either get the itis eating it all or have enough for another meal. I admit to having had breakfast spaghetti a few times.   The gals here are super sweet to boot. I have come here only once on a weekend and found it crazy packed since theres only like 5 tables so I tend to eat here weekday nights.   If you love a hearty satisfying pasta meal, this is a great bet for quality, portion and friendliness!   Definitely one of my favorite new finds in town to dine at after a long day at work.",

    "text": "Hidden little gem! What's cool about this place is that you can customize how you want your pasta dish to be. I mean it can get pricy if you keep on adding more stuff to your pasta or even what type of pasta noodle you get. We ordered the chicken parmigiana and pappardelle with a meat sauce and meat balls. Let me tell you the portions are HUGE! I feel one dish is enough for two people. The chicken parm was so good. Maybe a lil better than most top Italian restaurants. The pappardelle was not bad I felt the noodles were a lil hard side and not al dente. The sauce was on point tho. Before they serve the main dishes, they give you bread and fresh tomatoes. I want to go back and try their ravioli!",

It doesn't feel like a sit down place, although they do have a few tables.  I have dined in and had trouble with the comfort of the chairs - while stylish, not so good for sitting in.  This is more of an order and take to go type of place in my opinion.  Why three stars and not higher?  Because it's pricey in my opinion for not being a sit down type of place.  Ya pick your pasta for one variable price and then your sauce for another variable price.  Again, eating goodness but I actually went, \"damn!\" On the price.  Thus, the other day after craving pasta and thinking of this place - deciding to pass because of price (for a mostly take out type of place).   It's worth a try for sure - but not sure I am to be a regular even though it's less than a mile from my house.",

This is by far the best pasta restaurant we have come across. A couple of tips: 1) Get it to go! The restaurant is small and every time I've been there it's had a weird smell, almost like a sewer problem. 2) Skip dessert - their chocolate cake looks tempting, but when I tried it I was disappointed that it was pretty dry and had that refrigerator taste to it. Oh well, that just means you have more room for pasta!  Pasta Idea has become a new staple for my family whenever we're in town. New York has the pizza, but Las Vegas has the pasta!",

    "text": "This place is a joke! Being run by \"teenagers\" who are in need of going to school for business management.  We came in yesterday at 8pm. Everything was good until our food came. My husband ordered the special of the day with the \"meat sauce\" etc. The pasta was super dry and bland. So we asked our server for extra sauce on the side so the food won't be so dry. They gave us marinara sauce ONLY.  Another teen came by the name \"carrie\" and we told her were canceling the order. She insisted on making another one but we said no, it's fine we don't want it. She replies you can't do that. She then takes the food to the back. When we were finished with our meal, she hands us our receipt and said we had to pay for the pasta we didn't eat. I refused to pay for something we didn't eat but she kept insisting we pay. When I ask for management, another young teen with a beard, said there's no management and no contact of manager. I asked well what happens if there's an emergency? He replies, this is not an emergency. I told carrie, I refused to pay for the pasta cause we didn't eat the food, if I have to, I'll pay my only bill I ate and will call the cops to escorts us out. Then she  blurts out, we're a small business here and your no longer allowed here. Totally fine with me, with the bad customer service I doubt I'll ever step back in. I ended up paying only for what we ate and left.  Too bad, this place could've been good but with the lack of knowledge of customer service, it shows a lot they will not succeed in business.",

I walk up to the counter and start speaking and the older blonde lady rudely interrupts me as I'm trying to ask a question (being a first time guest) I'd like to ask how things work, so she says the other lady will be right with me. So I wait, and wait and the other lady steps to the counter and asks what I want and I tell her. She said that they were busy which there's 7 tables literally in the entire restaurant and people at 5 of the 7. I work at a restaurant and know what busy is and this was not it. So I sit at a vacant table as I wait for my food to go and the older blonde lady brings food from other tables to the vacant table I'm sitting at to box for her leaving customers and literally scrapes the food into the boxes in my face, I'm surprised she didn't get any of their half eaten food on me as a sat there. Literally the worst customer service. Good luck going here.",

Next visit I think I'll try the mushroom ravioli.  Nice variety of sauces and pasta that are fresh and oh so tasty!  They are also working on a beer and wine license.  I ask our server and she said it was permissible to bring in your own wine.   We were thinking of Buca di Beppo for lunch and my husband suggested something different.

I arrived Monday evening and approached the counter to order to-go. There was only 1 other couple dining in so I was approached quickly by the staff. I felt a little rushed to order as it was my first time but they were really friendly. I ended up choosing the cheese tortellini with pink sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, grape tomatoes and chicken then a nutella cheesecake for dessert.   The wait was short and i was on my way home with fresh, hot food in about 20 minutes.   When i finally opened the bag up i found the sauce leaked out of the paper container the pasta was in and I was missing my cheesecake! It was frustrating to clean up the meal prior to eating and I live too far away to bother returning for my cheesecake.   The food i did eat was great - flavorful and large amount that i'll be eating throughout the week.   Despite the kinks and paying for something i didn't receive, the food is worth returning for. I'll just be sure to take extra precautions from now on.",

Both the tables were broken and shaking but we stuffed napkins to make it work. The service was AWFUL! There was hair on one of the breads and I put it aside but then 45 minutes after we ordered our food, I got my plate and there was a longer black hair in that too. GROSS!  we sat there waiting for almost an hour and didn't get a refill until the food came almost an hour. I asked for a lemon for my water at the beginning, when the server came out with the bread, and a third time when she came out with the food. I never got a lemon, even though she kept on saying yes I'll bring it. We should have known it was gonna take forever when the uber eats guy started yelling at his customer service because he was dispatched to pick up food and was told he would have to wait at least 20 min. We had to split the check 4 ways so we each individually walked inside to pay. My husband is 100% sure, he told the lady what our order was. As we were walking out, the server that has given us this horrible service yelled at us that we haven't paid for my dish- with the hair in it. I want to make it clear we are not the type of people that would just eat and then leave! I walked inside with my husband and pointed out the terrible service we received. The eloquent response I received was \"ok?\" We settled the bill for an additional $20 for one plate of food!!!! This place is a joke and I hope they get shut down by the authorities. Who know what else is going on in that kitchen.... do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",

There isn't any details about the sauces when you order online so have the menu pulled on on yelp for guidance. Two things about the online ordering is that when I ordered online it said my order would be available at :25. I arrived at :26 but didn't leave until :45. Not a huge deal but maybe if you're pressed for time better to call ahead to make sure it's ready!! Also in the \"special instruction\" section I requested mushrooms and it looks like it didn't process to them. Minor flaws in the online ordering method.

    "text": "It's imPASTA-ble to describe how much I love this place but I'll give it a try!   Whenever I'm in the area or whenever I'm craving pasta (which is pretty much all the time) I love to go to Pasta Idea, especially for their lunch special. It's $9.95 for a create your own pasta (only the ones with a * next to it are eligible) plus a drink and garlic bread with a side of tomatoes and chopped basil. Keep in mind that if you aren't dining here for lunch, the pastas can be a bit pricey BUT the portions are so huge so you can definitely share with another person! They also have delivery through Eat24 and BiteSquad if you just want to eat in but still get your pasta fix!   For lunch I recommend their pink vodka sauce with spaghetti noodles or their caprese with their cheese ravioli! We usually get those two and always end up super full at the end of our meal.   The space is pretty small so not ideal for huge groups but I'm sure they can be accommodating since I saw a huge group of 10 today when I picked up my order. Their customer service has always been great (I really miss those two sisters that worked here, haven't seen them anymore though :/) but today it was even more awesome since the guy was able to expedite my order because he knew I was in a rush despite how busy they were!   Love how their pasta and sauces are handmade and always fresh with authentic Italian chefs behind the kitchen! It's definitely a nice difference from the typical \"Olive Garden\" or other chain restaurants. I also love supporting local businesses so this is the ideal go to pasta spot for me!",

Based on their reply to my review it's obvious they have ZERO clue what good food is and also have no clue about customer service.   If I could give zero stars or less I would...the food was inedible. Meatballs were RAW. Sauce tasted like paste. Croutons were actually chunks of bread. When I called they hung up in me 2 times. When eat24 called they laughed at them. So unprofessional. Run fast and far away...do not eat here EVER.",

They come back on the phone and says that sorry but my order wasn't sent out yet and they were sorry. I asked well why was I told it went out when it didn't and her reply was sorry we were busy and I was told to call grub hub for a refund then she hung up. I would not recommend this place to anyone they have no customer service and didn't even offer to try and resolve the problem! If that's how they do business I'm pretty sure they won't be in business very long. That lady that answered the phone should be fired if they care anything about there business.",

We ordered a kids mac and cheese, a chicken parm, and lasagna.  Lasagna: cooked perfectly. Great taste with lots of layers. My only complaint was that it was a tad bit dry... and i mean just a tad. 4.5/5  Chicken parm: it was my wife's meal and it was a big meal if i must say. Lots of great flavor and chicken cooked just right. 4/5  Mac and cheese: was absolutely delicious! I was hoping my kids didnt finish it and i was lucky enough to eat a couple bites and had the opportunity to finish it for left overs! The cheese on that though..... yummmmmm!!!  Oh! And their garlic bread with tomato dip! Wow. Yumm  Love this place. The venue is small, but cozy. Service was friendly and fast. My only complaint is the overall price. $15 -$20 for each of the adult meals and i think about $10 for the mac and cheese.   But, I'd definitely go again!!  Added pics!",

My mushroom ravioli could have been another great dish if it wasn't for the over powering taste of flour used as the main ingredient in their Alfredo sauce.

    "text": "This is one of the newest restaurants in the Summerlin area.  Their concept is good and very interesting. You can select your pasta and the sauce you want. Their pasta is homemade authentic italian. You have about 10 different pasta options to select from and over 20 different sauces... They have it all! The portions size are very generous, you will for sure have left overs! I went over for lunch and they had a lunch special of pasta and a sauce plus and drink for 9.99. However, the offer is a bit deceiving because you can only pick two or three sauces for lunch. The rest of the menu was full price.  So at the end we spent about $15 each, which sounds a bit much for a lunch entree. Especially when you can go to olive garden and have all you can eat soup or salad and a pasta bowl for $6.99. In my opinion those two restaurants are similar in taste. The flavors were good, but nothing memorable.",

Most of the sauces come with meats and/or veggies in it. The menu makes it simple to pick what you want by dividing the sauces up by the base. Everything tastes pretty fresh. They give you garlic bread with a tomato spread that I could eat foreverrr but had to stop myself so I had room for my main dish. I tried the pappardelle pasta with imported porcini mushrooms and prosciutto crudo. The sauce itself was a little bland but the prosciutto provided the saltyness it needed. Definitely add black pepper. I also tried spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was really tasty. Meatballs were juicy and so tender on the inside. The sauce also comes with meat chunks in it as well.",

My boyfriend got the chicken parmigiana. It was huge and came with a side of spaghetti and marinara. It had a great coating and was topped with bubbling cheese.

Seriously the best pasta ever, and I'm Italian. Haha. Oh, and their Nutella cheesecake is to die for!!  My order was a to go order, for the price you pay the servings are gigantic, I only ate less than half of my pasta and I'm eating the cheesecake as I write this review, seriously though, if the pasta had sucked (which it did NOT) I would still come back just for this heavenly cheesecake    So I'm pretty much in love with this place.

First, the night before I order a couple of pasta dinner and a dessert and had the lady repeat my order, then my wife came back with a soup instead of dessert and was charged for it, and today, again i order spaghetti and specialty pasta (baked butternut squash ravioli) got home to find out that they gave me Rigatoni w some red sauce,and what irritated me the most is that I gave the guy a tip for making sure that I have the right order this time (of course I didn't checked because its tightly tied in the bag already) but how incompetent your staff could be!the first time, I could let it by, simple mistake right but second time in a row! Come on now! Driving 22mls to your restaurant twice to hopefully enjoy the pasta I was craving and you messing it up twice!  WARNING for patrons: Make sure to visually check your pick up order before leaving, therefore you'll avoid disappointment when you get home Update: After expressing the issue with Carrie she immediately offer a full refund on the item that was missing and I said no need for refund but she offers an invite to make up if I'm willing to come back which I did along with my family. This time no disappointment and she was very accommodating to us and we had the pasta that I had been craving. I was solved! Important note: this is still my go to place for pasta fix, incredibly good spaghetti, fresh taste and very reasonably priced.  Again, thank you for making the best pasta in my town!",

    "text": "My family will only go to Olive Garden for Italian food, because you get the best bang for your buck there. Unlimited amounts of breadsticks, soup, and salad, and you're too full by the time you get your entree so you just take it to go. Yup, we've all been there. Anyhow, I came up with this \"idea,\" (hah) that we try a different Italian place where they handcraft their own noodles, and I convinced them that it would be a lot better than Olive Garden. Sooo, we ended up coming to Pasta Idea about a month, and sadly, they were not convinced. At least I got them to try a place other than Olive Garden haha.   They strictly serve pasta here. No fried foods/appetizers so ya'll gonna have to get your calamari fix elsewhere. The four of us shared a cioppino, the pink diablo, lasagne, and a chicken alfredo, all with spaghetti pasta. They don't have linguine, but their spaghetti is similar to linguine. Portions are pretty generous. The pink diablo sauce was definitely the highlight with its smokey and spicy flavors. I would ask for less pepperoncini next time though, because it kind of overpowered the flavor of the pasta. Cioppino was pretty good along with the chicken alfredo. All the pasta was a little chewier than I would have liked, and the lasagne was ok, not the best that I've had. However, because they offer so many options, I am willing to give them another try. Service was great. The ladies (possibly the owners) serving us were very cordial.",

One thing that needs to be mentioned is that seating is EXTREMELY limited. There is seating for maybe 25 people comfortably. There is a little more seating outside, but I have never done more than walk by the outside tables so I can't say for sure.",

The others were cheese ravioli and chicken Alfredo.   Both plates were generous portions and steaming hot from the kitchen - no warm up or microwave here.

Over time, the quality started to drop - especially the quality of the proteins (meat, chicken) - so we stopped for a while. We tried it again after a long break and found that quality had dropped even more! The carbonara sauce we had for example, had mystery pancetta in it. All the pieces of pancetta were some strange mangled sinew and fat that once in your mouth, you have no choice but to spit it out (how gross) or gag on it! I never even knew it was possible for Pancetta to have sinew and chewy parts like that. It was Disgusting! The Veneto sauce also seems to have suffered from cutting corners on quality of the speck in it. It also was very skimpy on the asparagus, and half the cherry tomatoes were still green! I believe this was the last chance we're going to give them. Instead of maintaining quality or improving, they seem to be slipping into a very nasty place with questionable ingredients and no quality control. Paying almost $70 for 3 very bad pasta dishes, seems insane. So never again!",

It has a great rich and tangy flavor.....you could put it on cardboard and I would probably enjoy it (although it's even better on their gnocchi). As promised, I'm bumping up my review to 5 stars. I honestly struggle going out to \"casual Italian\" restaurant because I always feel like I could have made a better meal for much less, but this place is unique. It's very fairly priced, and everything is made fresh from scratch.",

I was shocked when I found out that the owners were from Italy and made their own pasta. It really shows in their cooking. This is the only Italian food I actually enjoy eating out.

My pappardelle was cooked to perfection! The bruschetta that came with the meal was delicious as well.     As some have stated, the place is very small (though it's next to a currently vacant space, so maybe we'll get lucky and they'll expand?). The atmosphere is nice. A little cozy due to the small space, but quite fresh/modern in appearance. Reminded me a lot of the pasta pomodoro near good ol' SCU.      Food was wonderful, although the lunch special could use a bit of work business strategy-wise. It would have been nice for our gluten-free member of they had included it as an option, even if it came at a dollar or so up-charge. It would have been nice if they included some more of the sauces at an up charge as well.      Price-wise it was a little on the expensive side, since we all ordered non-lunch special items. However, the quality and portions of food, along with the bruschetta was totally worth the price.     Last bit, I had the ice tea to drink, and it was quite different than what I'm used to getting at a restaurant. It had a coffee-ish undertone that was surprisingly pleasant!",

We had 3 different meals:  Spaghetti with meat sauce - DELICIOUS! The meat sauce is extremely hearty and flavorful  Pappardelle with pink diablo sauce - HOLY CRAP. It has just the perfect amount of kick to it and the pasta was perfectly cooked  Spinach ravioli with liguria sauce - BASIL BASIL BASIL! I've never had a pesto sauce more fresh than theirs - we got this dish without chicken to accommodate our vegetarian of the group which was good to know any sauce can be made without meat - all cooked TO ORDER.  Nutella cheesecake for dessert, need I say more?  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to every foodie and pasta lover!",

When we went, we were immediately offered a menu, and thought it was so unique how one picks their choice of pasta first, then sauce. The different sauces blew our mind, as we didn't know that many different sauces existed! Then, we enjoyed it so much, we went back three days later to try another sauce! The customer service was impeccable, as our food was prepared at the perfect time! Once the food was served, it was a quiet dinner.

    "text": "It's a small, locally owned spot with freshly made pastas that far surpass what can be found at Buca di Peppo a couple blocks down. Pastas are made fresh every morning and the flavors and execution are better than what can be found at most sit down establishments off the Strip. There hasn't been much buzz about this spot, but it's a restaurant worth checking out. While small, it's good for families and a quick bite.  Check the board for daily specials, like the fettuccine diablo ($14) full of bold flavored sausages, pepperoni, pepper and sundries tomatoes lightly covered in a pink vodka sauce. Their menu has a list of specialty pastas, as well. One is baked butternut squash ravioli ($14.95), with equal amounts of sweetness and savoriness and covered in a layer of blistered cheese.   You can build your own pasta dishes, but their pricing structure is a little awkward. You choose your pasta (there are over a dozen options priced between $4 and $10 each), then choose your sauce (over 3 dozen types from $4 to $12). I loved the pesto gorgonzola, but the gnocchi I paired it with was rather thick and dense.   Created by the same people responsible for Spaghetti Western in Southern Highlands, this tiny spot has quickly gained in popularity despite lacking in marketing. But, judging from the crowds that constantly fill their tables, locals are already aware of this gem.",

She was so inattentive that a couple, that sat on a table next to me, left furiously because they weren't greeted, at all.    The worst part of my experience was the food.  I've been here 3 times, prior, and the chicken was fresh and grilled.  This visit...the chicken was disgusting.  It seemed like scrap pieces that they forgot to throw away...fatty, yellow, chewy, absolutely gross.  The chicken seemed as if it was boiled, previously, then heated up in the microwave so that the pieces were all rubbery.  I couldn't eat any of the pasta...I got,  completely, turned off!  The ice tea was good!  I'm really sad to be so disappointed by Pasta Idea...when it was becoming my fave place!  :(",

    "text": "Hummm Ok I see with all the reviews here that only one other person had a problem with the menu at Pastaidea. But something is wrong here.  My friend and I went for lunch today and you need to beware that the  \"choose a Noodle\" means you are paying a separate amount for whatever noodle you choose like my friend picked the Mushroom Ravioli which was $7.45 just for the pasta.  Then you choose a sauce , well she choose Spicy Marinara which added a whopping $9.75 for a \"Marinara Sauce\" to the total for her dish which made the dish cost a whopping $17.20 for a fast lunch in a basically a fast food place.  Now I can understand paying that sort of price for a fabulous plate of pasta at a higher end \"real\" Restaurant but not a small little 5 table and little metal chairs joint with no bar, in the back of a strip mall.  Thank God she didn't order a side salad also add another $6.70 or God forbid she ordered the Carbonara Sauce $ 10.45 or the Veneto Sauce (Asparagus, grape, mushroom & Prosciutto Crudo) for 11.45 extra charge which would have made Mushroom Ravioli and Asparagus sauce total $18.90. They also freeze their pasta and sauce. Pastaidea  you need to look at high end great restaurants with seasoned famous Chef's prices: Sauce included with the Pasta: WOLFGANG PUCK'S in Summerlin =Orecchiette with Sausage=$17.00, Spaghetti AND Meatballs+ $18.00 NORTH ITALIA in Summerlin=Spaghetti AND Meatballs also at $17.00, Bolognese meat sauce $18.00, Strozzapreti (my fav) has fresh Chicken, roasted Mushrooms, Spinach, Toasted Pine Nuts and Fresh Parmesan cream sauce= $18.00 MARCHE BACCHUS FRENCH BISTRO in Las Vegas= Veal Ragu Pappardelle $18.00 So I say POO POO ON PASTAIDEA, not a great idea!",

We ordered from here once at work and I had the baked mushroom ravioli and it was delicious. Today I got the chicken parm because the gentleman at the register recommended it and I wasn't let down. So delicious and the portion is HUGE. And it's so cheesy! I only ate half the chicken and about a third of the spaghetti and I'm stuffed! They mostly have different types of pasta and meats that you pair with sauces and they have a ton of different sauces. It's about the same price as like Olive Garden but better. My dinner was $15 but I get at least two meals out of it. Maybe even a third small meal. The staff was super nice. It is small so it's not a good place for big groups but I'd rather eat while I watch my Netflix afterwards anyways lol",

    "text": "Finally!  I and and a family member have been waiting 15 years to find spaghetti bolognese (with meat sauce) this fabulous.  I didn't dine in, but had leftovers the minute they came in the door. It was nothing like the 'pasta soup' I so often receive, but just as pasta should be.  The sauce stuck to the pasta, with plenty of meat in the dish.  It was not your usual bowl of tomato paste or sauce, but meat sauce and pasta \"married\" so to speak.  It was ordered, \"dry, not watery\" but I don't know if it was prepared any differently because of that. Cannot wait to try their porcini mushroom white cream sauce with fettucini.....or perhaps the specialty, bigoli.  An FYI, I'm told the space is very small, with few seats.  Bet they'll be expanding! This dish was superb.",

The place is very small with very limited table seating. Lucky for us when we arrived there was a table available.   You start off with your choice of pasta then pick your sauce. Or you can get one of their specialties pastas.  First they bring out this amazing garlic butter toast bread with a pesto sauce of some sort to dip in.  I had two entrees because I couldn't choose between the mushroom Ravioli and Spaghetti with Red Diablo sauce. Also because I'm a fat ass. Anyways, both pastas were delicious but the spaghetti with Diablo sauce was the winner. Sauce was spicy, savory and delicious.  My Mother had the Chicken Parmesan.  Niece loved the Shrimp fettuccini Alfredo.  And my Father had the #38, Shrimp and Scallops Fra Diavolo.   The owner and young lady working were both  super sweet. Very attentive on making sure we didn't need anything. My parents loved it so much they're already talking about going back. I highly recommend it if you're in the area.",

I understand it is a small place with a pretty significant take out business but to disrespect people dining in and have no clue as to how long we had been sitting there and seeing take out orders filled first is unfathomable.

I came with a group of 5 and we order the meatball appetizer, two orders of the chicken parmesan with alfredo sauce both with fettuccine, the garlic lovers with fettuccine, the pesto gorganzola with spaghetti and the campania with cheese raviolis.  The meatball app was very tasty and we also received complimentary bread which was crusty and delicious.      It look a little longer than I expected to receive the food, but it was worth the wait. The plates themselves had very generous portions. I ordered the garlic lovers and it was pretty good, although I thought it could have had a stronger garlic flavor. The only problem was that I ordered it with fettuccine and it came with a thick spaghetti. I do not like spaghetti but I didn't want to make a big deal about it so I just started eating but they also messed up on the pesto plate with instead of spaghetti they put fettuccine. I tried some of the chicken parmesan, the flavor was there but the chicken was a little dry. The staff was nice and the only other complaint I would have was the the sodas tasted a little watered down. Overall it was pretty good experience and I would come back to try some of their different flavors.",

Just enough real Romano, egg yolk and pancetta.   The place is small and cozy w no fuss but I feel like sooner rather than later that's going to change!   The prices are affordable and a great alternative to 50.00 pasta plates at lackluster strip Italian Spots.  The staff is friendly and welcoming. They don't serve alcohol which made me love them More! Portions are huge so one plate is enough for two or a doggy bag tomorrow.  This place definitely goes on my VERY SHORT list of acceptable restaurants for my family.",

We were told it was 80 cents each for the Parmesan and red peppers even though they have Parmesan and red peppers on the table for the customers who eat there. The money isn't the issue however when we order a $20 pasta entree parmesan and red peppers are normally standard at any Italian restaurant, even pizza places for that matter. If they are that that cheap with their condiments it makes me wonder what other corners are they cutting in the kitchen. It's a shame because we stay around the corner from This establishment and actually enjoyed their food however they have a lost a customer for life.",

    "text": "When I stopped by this place the other night, it was packed and had a 40 minute wait time- so I decided to try it Today for lunch instead. To finally find a place that offers homemade pasta; I couldn't pass it up! I would have given it 5 Stars, however my first impression/ the order I received was not 5 star quality. I spent $27 *Tip not included* for a Chicken Parmigiana Entree, Pasta E Fajioli soup and a Drink; so it was a bit pricy. (Don't get me wrong, the food was on point and the flavors / quality of ingredients met my expectations), but there were definitely some shortcomings. To start off, when I order a $7 bowl of soup, I expect it to be a $7 bowl of soup! Instead, I received a soup which was only 1/2 way filled. It almost gave me the impression that they ran out, and instead of just telling me- they simply poured what they had left in a container and called it a day. The pasta in the soup was Al Dente, so it was done right. It wasn't over salted or anything... it was just half way to the top- which was not a $7 bowl of soup in my eyes. The Chicken Parmigiana was just that- Chicken Parm. The portion size was plenty, so the $16 price tag was well justified. The sauce was perfect / the Pasta was cooked to perfection, and it was piping hot, so no complaints there. Now the soda... I'm pretty sure their machine ran out of carbonation- so I received a Flat Soda, so I had to purchase one from the work-room vending machine for my lunch- I shouldn't have had to do that, but it's life. Had I received the full order / portion of soup that I paid for and a the cold Pepsi I expected, my experience would have had been different, but it's the little things like that which ruin someone's first impression. I will likely try this place again, but I won't make the mistake of assuming the order was done right.",

    "text": "Went with a friend who loves this place. Swears by the mushroom ravioli.   I had their GF fettuccine. It was carelessly cooked (noodles stuck together like if you don't stir them), and a little more al dente than I'd have liked. Flavor was subpar, consistency was a little odd....it was somehow both undercooked and falling apart. Barilla does it better.   Also, they served a breadstick with my GF pasta. *eye roll* If I were more severely averse to wheat I'd have sent it back.   The rest of it was good though, and service was friendly if a bit hard to track down to get condiments and refills of water. I'd come back, but I would choose to suffer for a day or so in order to have their regular pasta.  3-stars until more data points exist.",

The pink Capania sauce was delish. Lots of sun dried tomatoes, very well seasoned, and served HOT and fresh. Service warm and friendly. I look forward to coming back and trying more pasta/sauce combos. The menu is extensive and given 20+ pastas and even more sauces the options are endless. Plus I saw ravioli, lasagne and other baked dishes as well as dessert on the menu.",

She had the Baked rigatoni  & I the Mushroom ravioli with the pesto & gorgonzola sauce. I would have to say it was some of the best ravioli I have ever had.

I'm so used to getting some old lettuce and a tomato when I get a side salad but this was full of fresh ingredients spring mix, fresh tomatoes, huge chunks of cheese, roasted peppers, olives, and was enough for at least 2 people! Meatballs I'm always super picky. They weren't the best I've ever had, but they were good. Overall I'm bummed i ordered when I was housesitting cause I'm too far away to get delivery where I live  but for anyone that lives in this area I doubt you'll find a better place!!",

Young kid came over and said it was his first Saturday shift and apologized.  No problem!  He took our order immediately, still no menus, but we knew what we wanted.  Brought us drinks and free garlic bread.  Fast forward one hour later still no food.  Remember 6 tables and 3 servers.  2 tables had come in after us and were DONE eating.  I finally said something and server said it will be right out.  5 minutes later another server comes out and told me they had no more gnocchi left, do I want to order something else.  I was furious told them no and wanted to talk to the manager.  They said the owner is out in the kitchen and he will be right out to explain.  Waited 3 minutes staring at owner and he never came out.  Left and will never go back.  Just read post about new owner and that explains everything.  That sucks cause this was my favorite pasta.  It will be closed in one year, damn.  44 years old and I have never written a negative review, so disappointed.",

We had the antipasto mista, rigatoni w meat sauce , cavatelli  Campania, and spaghetti w clam white wine sauce. And each one was better than the other. The pasta being made in house was delicious and everybody's favorite out of the 3 pastas was the Campania. It was rich and fresh and just out of this world good w the cavatelli.  Everything is so good we are going back tonight to try some more dishes. I highly recommend them and will take pics tonight",

When you walk in you'll stand at the cash register for quite a bit of time and the staff will walk by you without saying anything. It's pretty bad customer service I wouldn't say that they're rude but they don't try to make you feel comfortable and they don't seem to enjoy their job and there definitely isn't an Italian warm feel to the place. I got pesto spaghetti and it came out to $17 which I was a bit surprised by especially since the food is mediocre. The pesto sauce was watery and bitter like an amateur made it and although it wasn't disgusting I have to say it was by far the worst pesto sauce I've ever had. I'll be surprised if this place lasts. I read some of the other reviews and I was also put off by the fact that the owner will respond to other peoples yelp reviews in a very rude and defense of tone rather than having a genuine interest in improving the place and catering to the customers.  I think that says a whole lot about the place.",

So we waited for someone to take our order. About a 10 to 15 minute wait. My wife said if no one comes in a few minutes we would leave. Finally the waitress came over and took our order. Two waters and two drinks. She left and came back with some bread ( three slices for two people ! ) it was not crisp but very soggy. She came back with the waters and one drink and had to go back for the other. While we were waiting for our food we watched what was going on. The waitress messed up the order on the table next to us, and the other person working there came over to our table with someone else's order. This happened a few more times with others orders. It was like they could not remember who got what. Got our food finally, wife got the  Bigoli noodles with meat sauce which she said noodles were a little chewy and sauce not tasty. I got the regular noodles with meat sauce and meat balls, noodles a little chewy and sauce seemed ok but different then the meat sauce my wife got. Meatballs were small and not very tasty. Food was not very hot when served to us. So we tried it and will not got back because of service, taste and price. All items are al carte which adds up.  We will stick going to Mezzo Bistro which is about same price or cheaper and the meatballs are the size of a baseball and has good service and larger tables.",

I ordered pasta with meat sauce because the cashier told me it was her favorite. So I thought to myself, 'Huh, meat sauce is a good place to start. It's tomatoes, meat, and seasoning, so it can't taste bad.'   Wrong. So wrong.   The meat sauce had no flavorful herbs; it BARELY tasted like salt and a passing breeze of one pungent herb that is simply indescribable. The sauce had almost no meat, and was so watered down that I couldn't even taste the tomatoes.   The noodles were fresh, yes, but again, there was no flavor to help them along in the meal.   My bread was burnt on one side, tasted mostly like butter (a twinge of garlic flavor). The best thing about the entire meal were the tomatoes in the bruschetta. The topping itself tasted sour, but the sweetness of the tomatoes saved it.   I would've rather spent my $12 at Olive Garden.  needless to say; I won't be coming back.",

I wish they had more locations throughout the valley. This one is not close to us, but while visiting family and decided to grab a bite. Very glad we chose PastaIdea.  Well, here I am 5 days later with high hopes and everything was a complete 180 from last time. The service was awful. We were a party of 2 and there were 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. It seemed to take forever to have our orders taken. The food didn't seem nearly as fresh as it came out only moments after ordering, telling me the prepared dishes were simply heated up before being delivered to our table. After dinner I pointed out, to the very impersonal  waitress our displeasure in our meal. She seemed to have many excuses as to why the service was poor, such as \"the other waitress is new\", \"it's our busiest time and we don't make enough money to have an extra waitress here for 8 hours when we're only busy for a couple hours\" or \"we had several phone orders coming in for pick up or delivery.\" This experience has brought my 5 star review quickly to a 2 star review.

This is a small but mighty pasta family owned restaurant that has been there 7 years (we have been in the area 30+ years) and I just recently read about it on Nextdoor! Wow! We plan to do some orders for family gatherings. I had the butternut squash ravioli and my husband had Mac and cheese pasta. Both were absolutely scrumptious!!!! The place is small but they also have patio dining, take out and food delivery service. Try it-you will love it!",

We had the lobster ravioli to start- that alone probably would have been enough to fill me up and was lip smacking good! I also had the gluten free fettuccine with pink sauce and it was SO GOOD! My boyfriend had the Bolognese and was over the moon happy with his choice. Our server was super sweet and attentive.",

    "text": "We have been here several times, and the food and service has always been excellent, but yesterday was much different.  I don't know if this is new ownership, but they didn't seem to know the menu well.  I'm vegetarian, so I usually get something a bit more customized, like a certain sauce, but without the meat.  In the past, they have been super accommodating and suggested which things might pair the best.  We ordered two dishes and wanted them spicy.  Took our food to go.  All four of us were truly disappointed.  It wasn't spicy at all, and it was just totally bland, with the exception of garlic.  I seriously doubt we will go back.  Another thing I really didn't like is that they had a child in the dining area watching the Disney channel on TV.  That's great that you have a family business, family restaurant, but if we were dining in, that's a big turn-off in terms of ambiance.  Granted, it was just 5:00 p.m., and no one else was dining, so maybe they turn it off when they have patrons dining in.  Used to love it, but not anymore.",

    "text": "This place is definitely one of the best restaurants you will find when in search of fresh pasta and fresh ingredients while still remaining True to authentic Italian flavor.  Being a Las Vegas native, born and raised, I figured this place was going to be just like every other Italian place. Needless to say, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.   We were greeted almost immediately and seated with drinks served shortly after. Our two year old child was accompanying us, and he was offered crayons and a coloring paper to keep him occupied.   Fresh bruschetta was served immediately following. The bread itself was fresh out of the oven with a crisp golden color on the outside, and the soft, warm texture in the middle of a perfectly baked bread. The bread itself had been delicately brushed over the top with a mixture of olive oil, fresh Italian herbs, and a hint of parmesan. The herbs were so fresh that you could tell they came immediately off of the plant as they lacked that crispy, dried texture of herbs that are obtained from the store or bottled herbs. The tomato mixture of the bruschetta was served in a small separate bowl instead of on top of the bread like other restaurants serve it which prevented the bread from getting soggy. The tomato bruschetta mixture contained the same fresh herbs. The tomatoes themselves were fresh, crisp, and slightly sweet in taste. The combination of both complimented each other perfectly.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The chicken itself was of a high quality, tender cut with absolutely no fat or grisly pieces, evenly coated, topped with a baked mozzarella cheese blend over the top, slightly golden brown. When you cut into it, the melted cheese mixed with the perfect amount of crispy batter over the chicken was enough to keep your mouth watering. The combination of the marinara sauce set this dish over the top of any competitor. My grandfather is from Sicily, and this was the only sauce I have ever tasted in comparison to his. In Italy, the people will ONLY pick and use what is in season. It has to be perfect, and this chef chose the perfect seasonal tomato to make a fresh, sweet, marinara sauce that you can only find here. Every Italian recipe for sauce is different, but I found this one to be most like my grandfather's which will always be my favorite. Since he is no longer around, this is definitely my new Italian go to spot for pasta!  The taste of authentic Italian food differs greatly from the Americanized marinara sauces you'll find at Olive Garden chain type Italian restaurants which is why some may not like the taste, but this is authentic Italian food. For those of you who are Italian, that is hard to come by now days.  If this isn't enough to get you to visit, my husband is a fine dining chef who has worked at both the Wynn and the Paris. He has also worked in the presence of Chef Gordon Ramsay. At times I get irritated because my husband is one of the most critical, pickiest, worst people to take to restaurants because he's such a foodie snob. Even he liked the food. His only complaint was that he thought the shrimp was slightly undercooked, but enjoyed his meal (fettuccine with shrimp alfredo sauce) very much which is a huge compliment coming from him! Lol",

This is a one off location owned by a guy who just came over from Italy. He hand makes his pasta each day. That's why everyone is raving over it. I don't even know what to say other than it was AMAZING. The service was great. Our server was super friendly. We were there until they closed. So she went home and the owner closed us out. Cool guy. A little hard to understand him actually because he still has a super strong accent and his English isn't so great.   This place will be in our regular rotation of places to eat for sure.   And yes the portions are good size (not huge though) and yeah the seating options are limited. Oh well. Some of the best places I've ever eaten were small cramped places.",

    "text": "So this is a little hole in the wall restaurant. It's not very spacious at all and the decor isn't exactly welcoming. However, if you're looking for highly priced take out, this is it! They do deliveries also. Now, don't get me wrong, Pasta Idea has some pretty good eats but it's not the kind of place you bring your family to if you're on a budget. It's quite expensive for a place like this, but the food is tasty (I'm a sucker for garlic bread & I loved theirs)! I had bigoli pasta with the pink diablo sauce. It was very good - although I'll probably get something less spicy next time. The lasagna was on their \"favorites\" menu, but I've had better. It was mostly pasta and very minimal meat sauce. The meat sauce is tasty, though, I must admit. If you feel like splurging on a meal one day, by all means check this place out. But if you're looking for food on a budget, pasta idea is not for you.",

It was our first time there so, thankfully we got a seat cause I guess people call ahead and reserve tables. Service was a little slow, they had one waitress and all the tables got filled up all at once. Took awhile for them to take our ordered, seemed a little unorganized. Once we finally ordered, the food came out and wow amazing flavor and huge portions. We ordered mushroom raviolis with Red Diablo sauce & chicken parm. Finally a place who knows good pasta. The garlic bread amazing which is complimentary when you dine in. I bought cannolis to take home. Those were just pooas amazing crunchy and so fresh. Done right. Can't wait to go back and try this place. Prolly will order and take home, seems a little too stressful to get in there and get a spot. Hopefully a bigger place will come soon, but totally understand the concept. Will be back gonna try some of the white sauces next time.",

I knew it would take a while so it said 8:10 and I was very prepared to wait.  At 8:20 I called and they said that they had the order but that a group of 12 had come in and they were behind.  I said okay.  They said it would be out the door soon.  At 8:45 I called again (they closed at 9) and they assured me it was still coming and said that they had soccer teams come in but would throw in a free bread.   Our Uber driver came at 9:10 and I felt so bad for her because she had been waiting at Pastaidea for 1 1/2 hours for our order to deliver it.  I gave her a $15 tip.  When I got inside our order was missing 1 entire dish, 1 fountain drink, and the bottled drink was the wrong kind.  I called Pastaidea for the 3rd time and the person answering the phone listened to what was wrong and told me he was going to get the manager.  I waited on hold for 16 minutes and then they hung up on me without ever coming back on the line.  I called back and they answered and hung up on me.  I called again and a female answered.  I again explained what was missing and she stated they would take my name and number and I could come in for a free entree.  The time and the missing food was one issue, but the unprofessionalism by Pastaidea to correct the situation is why I am typing this.  I asked that the manager call me tomorrow.  I will update this review if I hear from anyone from the restaurant.  The food we got was great, lukewarm but great as always.  If you want to eat there DINE IN.",

Note: 3 tables: 1 finishing, 1 mid-meal, and 1 waiting for entrees.  7p last table gets entrees, still no food. Walk inside to check they said it will be ready soon. New couple sits down.  710p new couple gets entrees, still no food. T walks inside to complain and I call yelp customer service.  715p All they offered was an effin free dessert for the wait. No apologies, nothing. GTFOH!  I'm sorry, but a dessert does not make-up for the fact that you knowingly made the entrees for the people who came in after us.  How the F do you expedite an order that comes in at 7p over a prepaid takeout order that comes in at 615p for 645p with the customer waiting.....  The older woman server barely acknowledged us. The younger man behind between the counter and the kitchen has no clue and kept saying it was coming. Kitchen was a joke.   Whoever the owner of this place is seriously needs to train his staff or shut this place down.  Utterly disppointing.  Good news, saved myself $40 for overpriced pasta.  Don't waste your time.",

Our order was place and we showed up five minutes earlier to let them know we were here. They tell us it's coming. We wait another 10 minutes after our pick up time. We ask them what's going on with our order, guess what they say \"it's coming.\" We wait some more . No acknowledgement from the people in the restaurant on our order, so I patiently wait to give them a chance 2 couples come in at this point that have been seated and it's 35 min wait now . I see the wait staff serving their meals . I approach the restaurant staff and ask what happen to our order and how does a walking that came after us get their order . Guess what they tell me it's coming and offer a dessert since we were making it known   No apologies   Definitely never coming here   Terrible service   If I could give no star I would   By the way, we order off yelp and yelp even called them ... no result. And yelp had to call for them to offer a free dessert",

I been wanting to trying this Pastaidea place for a month. North Italia got in the way last week but was able to stop here for lunch yesterday.   The service was amazing, he got me bread with in a minute that I was there. I didn't think I was going to have an amazing experience due to the place being small. I honestly think they should come up to centennial hills where it much needed. Quick and fast homemade pasta.   I have the lobster ravioli with Alfredo sauce which it was only $18 pretty cheap, my girl had the chicken. Garlic sauce.  With a noodle I never heard before. Bugoli, it's pretty thick noodle. Their claim, they're the only ones in town with it. Might be True cause I never seen it.   Most likely to come back and try other type of past and sauces. It's a must for lunch or they're even in uber eats for delivery.",

    "text": "What a hidden gem! Service was super friendly and accommodating and food was great! Portions are HUGE and they are really generous with garlic bread and drink refills. Garlic bread is really good by the way.   They offer many varieties of fresh made pasta and let you pick the sauce you want. There are about 40 sauces to pick from. They can even customize. For example, I wanted the Amatriciana but on the menu it said that it was spicy but they are able to make it mild. The table next to us ask for no cream in one of the sauces and they were able to accommodate that as well.   The baked butternut squash ravioli was recommended to us and it was amazing. The filling was smooth and creamy with just a hint of sweetness. I would go back just for that!  Chicken parmigiana was good too. The spaghetti that came with it was delicious!  We didn't know how big the portions are so ended up ordering a 3rd dish for the 2 of us. Bigoli with Amatriciana sauce. You can probably guess we weren't able to finish and had tons of left overs which they were really kind to pack up for us as well.  Wonderful service, delicious fresh made pastas. Will be back soon!",

    "text": "We stopped in here for takeout the other night and it was an \"interesting\" experience. We had searched for pasta before we left the house and this place was close so we decided to try it. What we didn't realize is that it is located in a little strip mall and only has about 5 tables. Whatever, not a big deal.   They were very crowded when we stopped in and so we decided to take it to-go. One of their employees was pushing tables together to make room for a large group and she just about bowled us over. She was very gruff and didn't seem to be thinking of customer service.   On the other hand, the lady at the counter was very nice and explained that you started by picking a pasta, then adding a sauce, then adding toppings. That sounded okay until I realized that just the pasta was going to be $4-$8 and then it was going to be another $4-11 to add sauce, and even more money to add toppings. For a tiny little restaurant, the price added up fast. Nevertheless, we went ahead an ordered. It came to about $65 (not including tip) for 3 people. We waited outside on one of the patio tables for them to bring out our food. That was nice.   When we got home though, we weren't amazed by the quality. Yes, the noodles were obviously made fresh and that was great, but the sauces were just \"meh.\" Of our three dishes, the plain pasta alfredo was definitely the best, and I'd probably come back just to order that. However, the other two weren't great. The red meat sauce was watery and could have used some parmesan cheese on top. Similarly, my boyfriend got some sort of pasta with sausage and he said it was just \"okay.\" We also shared an order of the chicken tortellini soup and it was very oniony, and that's coming from someone who absolutely loves onions. Had the entire meal not been so expensive, it probably wouldn't have been an issue, but I honestly expected more for what we paid. So while it's not a bad place to eat, it just wasn't quite what I was expecting for $20 a person.",

The portions are huge, the homemade pastas were cooked perfectly and the sauces were delicious. My chicken was expertly friend and had just the right amount of cheese.  I took home more than half of my meal. We ordered tiramisu and cannoli to go. Both wee mouthwatering. We will eat here again, and again.  Update 3/2. This time we ordered to carry out.

I want this place to stick around and be a quality go-to for pasta. I will go back in hopes it improves. I haven't been in a while because I've been a little disappointed more than a couple of times.  (Original Review) Pasta made fresh and delicious!  Amazing sauces. Small and intimate, yet casual restaurant/ cafe. Specials every day. A few casual desserts to choose from. The people are warm and welcoming. Espresso to finish it off. No alcohol. This is quite literally my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I always introduce good friends to this place, and bring dates I want to impress with good food and a friendly atmosphere. Hometown feel type restaurant in cafe environment in the big city where everything else is over the top and impersonal. A must-stop for top quality pasta.",

Tried the basic spaghetti alla marinara so I can gauge the taste of simple ingredients.  I know I ate more than I should have, but couldn't help myself.  A side of bruschetta accompanied the pasta - and that disappeared as well.  The place was small and quaint.  Plenty of seat space at 1pm on a Thursday.  The weather was perfect for enjoying next to the open door.  I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  Can't remember if they had genovese, but definitely would want to try that and the pesto.  Oh, they do have a decent kids menu too.",

The sausage in the sauce seemed to be high quality. I raved about the place so much we ordered it at work for \"Free Lunch Friday\". The guys that work for me got Alfredo and I ordered Chicken Parm. Everyone loved this place and asked me for the location so they could go there on their off time. It's seriously a hidden gem of summerlin and I hope they expand to the \"deep north\" of las vegas so I can go more often.",

The decor is nice and clean, you can tell attention to detail is important to the owner. They have a server come to your table rather than order at the counter and sit down. Hunter was our server, very attentive and knowledgeable (thanks!)  Let's get to the food, everything is fresh here. The pasta & sauces are made in house, and delicious! Portions are filling, there's enough to take some home.  The rigatoni with pesto & gorgonzola was flavorful. The cioppino over fettuccine was my favorite, a seafood medley of deliciousness! My only gripe: the snow crab comes with shell, so be ready to get a little dirty :)  I'm so impressed, I wish I didn't live so far from this place.

Add 4.50 for that nonsense. And my pasta was all chopped up to small strands of noodles like it was recycled pasta unused from another dish.

    "text": "I read reviews for this place and was so excited to try a place that made fresh, organic pasta. I'm sorry, this place was not good. I mean seriously not good. The reviews are extremely misleading. Which leads me to the conclusion they are all from family members and friends.   We ordered four different dishes and didn't like any of them. Their signature chicken parmigiana had very little taste. The kids Mac and cheese tasted like warm milk and the sauce was about as thin. My son wouldn't touch it. The best dish we had was the pesto pasta with Gorgonzola, it had some good basil flavor but lacked seasoning. We had a little bit of each and then fed the rest to our dog. :( $50 down the drain.   After finding the food to be so lack luster and the reviews not a good representation of said food, I feel taken advantage of, never how you want to feel after eating out. Fool me once, Pasta Idea.",

The decor is contemporary and clean. You can tell they take pride in their restaurant. The service was very friendly and everyone there was very nice.  I got the papadelle with campania sauce (a pink sauce with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic). Literally amazing. The pasta is homemade and fresh and the portion size is generous. They served it with a piece of garlic bread and fresh tomatoes... Um yes please.  Overall, super impressed and really excited to try more things off the menu. Check this place out for sure.",

They have some new things on the menu since the last time we visited the last time.  They serve garlic bread with bruschetta and were happy to give us an additional order when we asked.  We ordered the Prosciutto Crudo and Fresh Mozzarella Appetizer which was delicious.  The portion was enough for 5 of us to share, the prosciutto was exceptional and the cost was very reasonable at $11.45.  We ordered a variety of dishes, Amatriciana (spicy marinara with mixed Italian meats), clams in white wine with angel hair pasta, tricolor cheese tortellini, chicken piccata also with angel hair and ossobucco  which was one of the  specials.  All of our dishes were fantastic and although I did not order the chicken piccata I had the leftovers and it was one of the best I have had.  Every time we visit here we are very happy with the food and the wait staff that are very friendly and helpful.",

Other co-workers have followed suit after that and we've ordered here many times after that. We all agree that it's on the pricey side so when the company is paying, Pastaidea it is!   Some issues:  1. Our first time ordering, we asked the driver to bring change and he didn't. So he got a bigger tip than he deserved. I hope that wasn't on purpose...  2. Just recently, we called and specifically said for delivery, they took our cc payment and then told us they don't deliver. We asked for credit back and was told she didn't know how to do that and the manager was already gone. We were too busy at work to pick up our order so we asked for the manger to call us back. The manager ended up arranging someone to deliver our food.   Tips:  * You can pick what kind of pasta you like on and sauce  * They only deliver now through Grubhub",

They have a gluten free option among the many types of noodles they hand make. This was one of the major reasons we drove out to this area of Vegas.   The cafe is small but very clean. They have a small area outside that works as a patio if you wish to dine al fresco. I ordered the gluten free fettuccine with Boscaiola, a pink sauce that has speck, peppers, mushrooms, and asparagus. It was very creamy and the vegetables were very tasty. The speck a tad overcooked. The noodles were ok. It's very difficult to get gluten free noodles that are anywhere as good as their gluten filled noodle cousins. These were a bit chewy and stuck to each other. That said, the sauce made up for this.   My friend had spaghetti noodles with Friuli. It looked delicious. They serve complimentary homemade bruschetta. That's a plus.  The server was helpful and polite.  I will be back to try other sauces. I hope they decided to expand their gluten free noodle choices in the future.",

Spaghetti and meatballs: pasta is homemade and so is the sauce. Meatballs were tender and moist. Garlic lovers pasta: amazing! Fettuccini with a white sauce, chicken, broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. They also served a small Plate of bruschetta as an appetizer for no charge. Waitress also told us you can bring your own bottle of wine. We'll definitely be going back soon! Forgot to mention: prices are so friendly. $25 for both dishes and an iced tea.",

It is a really small establishment with few tables but the service and food was on point! The staff was extremely nice and accommodating without any hesitation.  The way the menu works is you first pick the type of pasta you want and then select the sauce you want -they have it broken down by different categories. Me and my boyfriend got 3 different pastas since it was our first time and we wanted to have a variety of pasta. They market that their pastas are homemade, which I'm not sure if that's True because we didn't witness any hand made pasta. We had the garlic lovers sauce with spaghetti, lobster ravioli with pink vodka sauce and fettuccine with meat sauce. They also give complimentary toasted garlic bread and bruschetta. Everything was DELICIOUS and honestly, we were so surprised! We were so impressed with the amount of flavor in all of the different dishes. To make things even better, the portions are huge and it is a major possibility of leftovers. My \"serving\" fed me 3 times. Pastaidea did not disappoint and I am already thinking of my next dish for next time!",

    "text": "Pastaidea is another hidden gem in town! After seeing it on yelp recommendations for like ever, I decided to give it a try! It's been extremely hard to find good Italian in the neighborhood that I live in, I'm so  happy that we now have Pastaidea.   I ordered takeout two times so far, I will add that the restaurant is pretty tiny inside, but it's super cute! If you do chose to dine in they have a few tables, as well as comfortable seating outside. Obviously if  you're with a larger group this may not be the best option, but if your looking for a bit more intimate setting, yet casual it's a great place to visit.   Last night my boyfriend and I ordered takeout,  I ordered  the butternut squash ravioli with carbonara sauce, and for him the spaghetti with meat sauce, sausage and chicken in it. I can't remember the name of the dish,but he was impressed, we also ordered the chicken tortellini soup, it was amazing!   I was a bit upset about the butternut squash dish, it was pretty much drenched in oil, totally inedible. I'm sure this dish would of been delicious had it not been for the oil, the flavor was great. I did go ahead and  call the restaurant, they were about to close, but the manager handled it wonderfully, as today I stopped in for a replacement meal!   I ended up ordering tonight another order of the chicken tortellini since it was so good, gnocchi with meat sauce which was beyond perfect!! It seriously  tasted like nonna made it! My boyfriend went with  with the chicken  parmigiana, that tasted great as well!   One cool aspect about Pastaidea is the unique concept of the menu, it's very easy to understand. They break down all the different pastas, sauces, and variations of how it could be prepared. They also provide signature dishes. With so many options to chose from there is sure to be something for everyone! I definitely wish they had more locations in town! You can't beat homemade pasta! It could be a little pricey, but the portion sizes are very generous. I'll be back for sure, hopefully to dine in!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I did not come here for the pasta.  My intent was to order a Caesar salad.  Before I left my house I searched for a place that had great Caesar salads and this place came up.  Upon arriving, the first thing I saw was \"handmade noodles\" on their restaurant sign.  In the snap of the fingers I forgot about that salad and ordered their flavored chicken alfredo (I know... I'm weak!).  I had a few minutes to look over their menu. You get a choice of several noodle types and then you pick a sauce; and boy do they have options! You can pick from red sauces, white sauces, pink sauces! I will definitely be coming back to check out their spicy fra diavolo!   Anywho, back to my dinner.  You get complementary bruschetta and bread before your meal (a lovely surprise). When my pasta came out, one taste and it was love at first bite! The number of bad alfredo dishes I've had in this city over the past few years melted away in that bite.  Creamy, not too cheesy, not too thick, the texture was just right.  The \"flavored\" part comes in with the onions and peppers they cook into the sauce.  It adds a layer of flavor that makes the dish pop!  The servers were quite friendly.  I spoke with a young lady who told me that this was a family owned restaurant and her father was the cook.  I love supporting local eateries and I think they have guts opening nearby a popular Italian chain restaurant.  Skip the chain... come here instead!   Note: they only have about 4 tables inside.  If you are dining in, this is not the place to bring 25 of your closest friends.  Order to-go instead!",

You have to be careful when reheating the 5 cheese sauce if you take it home because it loves to separate just like all cheese/cream based sauces.   Our order came out fast but after we placed ours, there was a ton of to-go orders that made the kitchen get backed up. Just an FYI.",

I really like the idea of create your own pasta where you choose your pasta , sauce , and toppings like meat and mushrooms , etc. Each single one is individually priced. Maybe if I ordered the more \"dinner-type\" menu items & went all out w/ my pasta I would have appreciated the food here more but we settled with their lunch specials since we thought it would be a good deal since comes w/ drink + bruschetta for about 10$.  Lunch menu options were limited and basic in terms of pasta choices and sauces. Hopefully they will expand this category. It also does not come with any meat options (have to pay additional).  I ordered the tri color tortellini + pink vodka sauce (which is mix of their marinara sauce + alfredo sauce + dash of vodka I believe). Tortellini I liked but pink vodka sauce tasted kinda canned. I know it's really not canned but tasted similar. My bf tried the ravioli + alfredo & it was just alright to me. It also looked like I had larger portion size than his. I think I enjoyed the bruschetta more than the actual meal itself.",

Place is very tiny no room to really sit so at first i was thrown off. I ordered a few things to go mostly a couple of ordinary items and i decided to try one special item which ended up being the best. Now this is a pasta place so dont come in here if your looking for chicken parm or veal but the pasta speaks for itself. Everything comes with a slice of garlic bread which is nice because bread always pairs well with pasta. I tried four different types of pastas and found a seafood one to be my favorite. Everything was great though and the portions are huge took me several days to polish off what i had gotten. I suggest this place to anyone looking for good takeout italian just dont expect to find a seat they need a bigger space this place could do wonders with the quality they are offering just need to relocate.",

I ordered one of their new specials tonight - Linguine black ink squid on seafood sauce with calamari, ahi tuna, shrimp, scallops, sole fillet.  They brought out some garlic bread to start, but I barely had time to sample it (it was good) before my pasta came out.  As they described when I ordered it, it has a strong seafood taste, which, since I like seafood, added to the dish.  Adding to the food, the service was excellent, and shows they care about everything.  Dish and drink being just over $20 (before tip), and it was worth every penny.",

My first visit, I had gnocchi with the creamy basil pesto. I love gnocchi so much, I've made it myself at home, and this was good gnocchi (good pesto, too). The portion was generous, and you don't just get garlic bread with the dish--it's also brought out to the table prior to your entree. The garlic bread isn't anything special or out of this world, but it's a nice addition.  My second visit, I had spaghetti with caprese \"sauce.\" (It was much more photogenic than the green gnocchi, but both dishes were absolutely delicious). Again, the portion was very generous, and they boxed up leftovers for me. I had leftovers both times.  It's small on the inside, not a ton of seating, but the service is friendly and fast, and the food is fresh and yummy. I hope they do well--I know I'll be back to support them!",

I had the ravioli and had them mix half Cheese, half cheese with the four cheese white sauce. The whole meal was a delightful surprise of fresh ingredients and great flavor. It came out so hot I had to blow on it before eating it and the portion was more than I can could finish.   It is a small shop, about 12 seats indoors. So order takeout if you must, but I'd try to get a seat to get it fresh and hot.   I'll come back to Pasta Idea again and again.",

The soup was homemade in house and had  a lot of multi-colored tortellini, plenty of chicken and veggies, but best of all, it had lots of flavor.     The sandwich was a chicken breast pan fried to a golden brown. It came with arugula,tomatoes,onions, pepperoncini, and a great citrus dressing. Definitely one of those sandwiches I will crave from time to time!!!!!!!!!!!! Our waitress was even kind enough to bring us a side of marinara and pesto sauces to dip our sandwich into.     Everyone that works here was super friendly and we definitely will be back. I just wish they had another location on the south side of town.",

    "text": "I came here with a friend the other night to give this new hot spot a try. Homemade sauces and homemade pasta sounded good  to me.  Here at Pasta Idea, your possibilities for dinner seem almost endless. You have the ability to make your dinner what you want it to be. Start by selecting one of the many homemade pastas (around 10 I think). Next, chose your sauce. There are red sauces, pink sauces, white sauces, creamy white sauces. Its maddening when you're hungry and everything looks good.   I settled on papardelle pasta with arrabiatta sauce. The pasta, wider than fetuccini but not as wide as lasagna, was very much al dente and maybe could have used a minute more in the water. My opinion of course. Still, it was delicious. The arrabiatta sauce was amazing. A fresh and spicy marinara loaded with olives. There was just enough spice to get my sinuses working overtime. The olives were rather strong tasting. Very briney. I would have preferred them to be chopped and tossed in the sauce more. Again, just my opinion. The people who run this place are from Italy and probably know what they are doing.  I also had a couple of pieces of garlic toast. One piece I had before my meal came out. It was served with a tomato dressing. Chopped tomato and garlic. Like a bruscheta I guess. That was good. The second piece of bread was served with my pasta amd was perfect to sop up the sauce.  Pasta Idea has a lot going for it with the whole fresh pasta and sauce technique. A freshness that you can most certainly taste. What is working against them is location. They are in a tiny corner suite of a strip mall and they cannot be seen from the street. In fact, I could not even see them from the parking lot. I had to get out and walk around to find them. But if you are in the NW and looking for good Italian food, do yourself a favor and find Pasta Idea.",

We ordered a beef tortellini, two chicken alfredos, and the seafood pasta dish (it has an Italian name and I don't really remember it).  The best thing is the portions! They are quite large for the price. I was especially impressed with the seafood dish, it had crab legs and clams I believe. Lots of seafood and pasta for about $20 bucks! The pasta is delicious. My chicken Alfredo had lots of chicken too. I'm used to having to ration it out to have enough sauce and noodles.   We ordered cannoli for dessert and they were delicious, as well! Everything was really good, nice atmosphere. Very kind people. If you are craving high quality pasta (I'm so tired of Olive Garden), then this is the place to go.",

    "text": "This restaurant used to be fantastic. And I'm talking about less than a year ago. There have been recipe changes and significant portion size decreases over the past several months. Specifically, sauces for dishes have turned 180 degrees in the wrong direction.  I used to look forward to their bruschetta with every order. Today they sent toasted bread with sides of marinara. Why has this place gone to crap? If you have a successful recipe (and they had many), why would you change it and affect the quality of the product?  My only guess is that the owner or manager may not have responsibly handled food costs.  But at the same time, if I'm spending $15-$18 for a simple pasta dish, at least give a decent portion.  I will not be ordering again. Too disappointing.",

Once again, so impressed! Go support this small business, you will NOT regret it!!!",

Seems like a sharp kid.) and the lack of two of my favorite noodles (penne and vermicelli ) , Pasta Mia, small and quaint, is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I saw the antipasto plate on the next table over and almost shouted \"Bravissimo!\". I am told their meatballs are truly scrumptious as well. I will definitely be going back la prossimo volta. Bon Appetito! I had the carbonara and it was terrific. Huge portion and took half home with me. Just as good a day later. I'm hoping to give them 5 stars because I am really in their corner and wish them the greatest success.",

The name almost prevented me from going there because it seems like a strange, and not particularly inviting, name for a restaurant but the food had good online reviews so I decided to try it. The restaurant is very small, has little eye appeal and even less atmosphere. Doesn't really look or feel like an Italian restaurant but looks more like a space that would be used for a coffee bar or frozen yogurt shop. The food was very good - well prepared and flavorful. But the woman that served us, although quite pleasant and helpful, was behind the counter preparing a take-out order for someone and kept putting her fingers in her mouth to moisten them to open the plastic bags to put the to-go containers in. Should a food server be putting their fingers in their mouth and then touching plates to serve to customers? It's disgusting and probably a health code violation besides. Based on the overall experience, I will probably not return in the future.",

    "text": "You will not find much better than this in town! Pasta Idea is a great concept where you have a price for both the pasta and the sauce.  Pasta's and sauces are made fresh daily and the 3 that we tried were all right on point.  We started with this fantastic fresh made Caprese salad with a beautiful heirloom tomato sliced into 9 pieces sitting on some fresh greens and topped with fresh sliced mozzarella with a balsamic glaze on top.  We just had to finish it all as it was so good and for only $10.95. WOW!  Our server brought us some fresh bread with bruschetta which was a nice touch.  We were getting full already. We each ordered a pasta dish which we soon discovered was to much as week took half of it home for Monday's lunch.  I had the pappardelle puttanesca.  I have not had fresh pappardelle since chef Marc's Parma was open and he only made it special. This is on the menu every day! The puttanesca sauce was fantastic with black tangy olives, nice large capers and small salty slices of anchovy in a fantastic tomato sauce.  The other guys both choose spaghetti with garlic lovers sauce and flavored chicken alfredo sauce.  We all shared each others dish and were more than happy with the flavors.  Even though this is a 30 minute drive for us it is well worth it to drive for a fresh meal like this.  The sauce and pasta combinations are just limitless with this concept.  It is a very small mom and pop place but it is bright and cheerful and the owners take good care of you.  The 3 of us ate for $60.02 including the tax and before the top.  We can not wait to go again.  I posted pics of our meals. Enjoy!",

It's so hard sometimes to find mom and pop shop style restaurants here in Vegas that it's exciting when you find one that's REALLY good. They have a big variety of pastas and sauces. I had the the fettuccine Alfredo and you could defiantly tell that the pasta was homemade and the sauce was creamy, delicious, and flavorful. I will definitely be coming back to try out their different pastas and sauces. The customer service was outstanding! I was greeted by two people as soon as I walked in.The gentleman that helped me explained the menu and told me about all the different options. He was patient with me while I chose what I wanted. I ordered to go and the food was ready in about 10 minutes. The portion was good for the price definitely something two people could share. *Bonus you get warm garlic bread! See again soon Pastaidea!",

The portions are pretty large. When you order your food, you are also provided with some very wonderful garlic bruschetta bread. I highly recommend this location, especially if you are looking for fresh, fantastic pasta!",

When we got the food home, my meal had items in it that were not listed on the menu ( I don't eat meat and it was loaded with bacon, which was not listed in the ingredients on the menu). We called the restaurant to make sure we got the correct item we ordered, and we did. They explained this is how this specific dish is served. The man on the phone said he would replace it with something else. We went back to the restaurant, and the person we talked to on the phone was not there, of course, and the girl that was there, said she could give us a $3 credit. Three dollars does not cover the $20.00 spent on the food I could not eat and was mislabeled on the menu. My husband was please with his food, however, the service was so bad, we will not return. It's important for a restaurant to remember that service is just as important as the food you serve. There are hundreds of good restaurants in Las Vegas, and I would recommend one with good food and good service.",

Ok on to the meatballs... it was a little tough to cut with the plastic fork so I just bit into it.  Ohh, it's meaty.  Got some noodles with sauce, oh yea, that's what it's about!  The mariana sauce is bold and flavorful, it packed a good punch.  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly.  Oh and the kids portion is huge!  It could feed my nephew and me!

    "text": "I'll be the first to say it: when I drove by, pulled up the rave reviews, and visited their website, I kind of scoffed at their claims of fresh-made pasta and sauces. Noodles & Co has been doing this for years, and we already have Mac Shack as a local version- same concept for all.  But my dinner here was really pretty great- I dig the modern kitchen decor, and the service is charming with a prominent Italian accent and genuine warmth. You pick from a variety of pastas and sauces, and add on apps, salads, soups, and/or desserts if you so desire. Note that pastas and sauces/toppings are priced separately, so this can add up- it's no bottomless Olive Garden bargain.   The mushroom ravioli ($5) was a generous portion of large, lightly-stuffed pillows. I opted for the pesto gorgonzola ($9), which was creamier than expected and quite rich. I would love to see them add a regular, robust pesto to the menu rather than just the cheesed version.  Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad ($11)- the tomatoes were underripe and flavorless, which didn't rise to the level of the the fresh mozzarella, basil, and other vegetables. I realize they're new, but until they can get a supplier who can provide fresh, ripe tomatoes, perhaps this should be sidelined or only featured as a special.  Split the pasta and salad for a large dinner, gave the rest to my guy- along with the complimentary bruschetta that comes with each order. Giant amount of food, total was just under $30, with tip.   NOTE: The lunch \"specials\" offer very limited, basic selection. Hopefully they will expand what is covered in this category. I currently cannot recommend it as a lunch spot, despite working nearby.",

Lol then I tried my husbands chicken Alfredo pasta and that was just heavenly... HIGHLY recommended!  They are also SO generous with the portions of everything!  Also while you wait you get the most delicious garlic bread with a very unique tomato dipping sauce!  So good!  And don't forget dessert!  We ordered cheese cake (so rich and creamy) and a tiramisu (so fluffy and the custard was almost like an ice cream... yummy)!!!!  The restaurant was so clean, tidy, and had a very warm and cozy family feeling to it with such a friendly staff!  It is a awesome place for a date night or a family dinner!  I don't see us ever going to Olive Garden again or any other pasta place for that matter!  We will be going back SOON and I will update with pictures!  Again HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!",

I really cant wait to bring the rest of my family to come and try it . The food is so full of flavor and everyone is so welcoming , walking into this place and eating here you feel like you're at home having dinner with family . If you haven't tried this place you're really missing out it's AMAZING . It will probably be one of the best places you eat out at .",

It is very reminiscent of a cheesier alfredo with a crumb top, but it is just so so good. They serve all orders with a piece of garlic bread, which is equally delicious. It is cheaper than some dishes you would find in olive garden, and it is great that you can just get whatever you want to-go if you are in a rush but want good food. The only down side is that it is very very small place. If you have a larger party, I would not suggest you go here. But you should definitely give it a try!",

The first visit was great back to 3/2017 was great, I'm a big meat ball pasta fan, so I ordered their meat ball pasta with meat sauce. The pasta was great with nice flavor.   I went back two more times after the first visit. That's when things start to go downward. I didn't get the meatballs with my order, and the portion was very small for the price. I called the manager and he promised he would make things right.   I've decided to give it one more try, I placed my order on eat24 and noted \"please include the meat balls this time\". They did include it this time, but the meat balls were under cooked, plus I got an extra metal string as a souvenir. The 5-inch metal string looked like either from a wine bottle or a can. I almost swallowed it....  I regret to give them too many chances to fix the issue. Their kitchen needs some serious management. I give them 2 stars for the sake of the first good experience.",

Today I got the Brie cream sauce with shrimp, tomato and asparagus with fettuccine. (It's called the gnocchi special but I substituted the noodle) SO GOOD.

Not sure if I would get it again, just because the scallops are chewy little mini scallops, but the shrimp were awesome.  We also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't taste it, but it smelled so good.   Lastly, the Nutella cheesecake was great (and cheap!) Perfect way to end the meal. The staff was really nice too when we ordered and picked up.

The restaurant is tiny so only a handful of tables are available for dining in. They had a large table reserved for a party that was coming in so we had to wait for one of the already occupied tables to vacate.  Our patience was rewarded and we were seated quickly and allowed to peruse the menu. I was torn between all the great options, but settled on the pappardelle with Diablo sauce. My pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a great kick.   Portions are not for the faint of heart so we had plenty of leftovers after our meal was said and done. Great spot and happy to have this quick serve option in the area.",

It was actually a place we found off yelp, and we loved it so much. But the last 2 times we've been, the food quality has been so low, and no where near worth the price you pay. Before, the food was cooked to perfection, and now the chicken is tough and you can taste the places they take shortcuts now. No longer does everything taste fresh but it feels like you're paying 20+ dollars for food made out of incredibly subpar ingredients. The prices have also gone way up, and for way less food. The last meal we had was nearly 40$ for the two of us, and the portion was so much smaller than what we expected. These last 2 times we ordered were from takeout, and perhaps that's why the quality was so low, but that doesn't excuse how unsatisfied we both left. Perhaps the dine in experience is just better, but for now we will be avoiding eating here.",

    "text": "I had a craving for linguine and clams one day, so a friend and I traveled here from across town. As usual, this place rocked.  The clams were small, but they give you a huge portion. Easily two fistfuls. The sauce had just the right amount of garlic, and the taste of the clams really came through in spite of the amount of parsley and garlic. Really, a simply incredible rendition of a classic Italian dish. The only adjustment I'd prefer is a slightly thicker sauce.  The ambiance is perfect for lunch, and the service was exceptional. I wish I could remember his name. A very tall, young guy who knew the menu well and provided just the right amount of attention to the table.  See you again soon, Pasta Idea!",

However I feel it's pretty expensive you have to order the sauce and style you like and depending on what type of noodle you pay another $5+ extra. Another thing that bothers me there hours of operation on there door is incorrect they say there open till 9am but then we went there at 7:00 to find them close and that wasn't the first time.",

I then posted a review indicating our disappointment in them closing and selling out because they are truly the best pasta place around.   I was subsequently reported for 'lying' because the business is still open. I actually just spoke with the NEW owner, and yes it was sold on 12/31/16. They were not supposed to use the same name \"pasta idea\" but apparently some deal was worked out to keep the name.  So the facts are: its a different owner, and different menu, with the same name.  The woman on the phone was super pleasant and understanding about the situation, and she encouraged us to go in and try their new menu. We will actually be doing that today for lunch!",

However I saw the pink vodka sauce pasta and I think I will get that next.  The meatballs and sauce was very succulent!  The potion was so big I could not finish it.  The only problem I had was the confusion of what came with the menu.  I did not know if the dish came with garlic bread or not.  So I ordered extra!  However it did come with garlic bread.  I also ordered the Caesar salad and my girlfriend ate that she said it was delicious.  You had the option to add chicken or shrimp or both to the salad.  They had choice of meats with the sauce from sausage to chicken and to clams and shrimp! White sauce, pink sauce meat sauce and coordinated with different pasta! The delivery service was on par when used Yelp to order.  I recommend this place to everyone the food was impeccable and the service was great!",

With every meal you get bruschetta (garlic bread w/ tomatoes, basil in olive oil).  The pasta is all home-made from scratch.  They also serve delicious home-made soups.  I have tried several items on the menu, and they are all excellent!  My favorites are:  Meatball Appetizer, the salads, Lobster Ravioli w/pink sauce, Shrimp Alfredo; and their Lasagna is to die for!  For dessert they serve home-made Tiramisu, Cannoli, Cheesecakes; which are great with their cappuccino or espresso made with illy Coffee Beans from Italy.  When you go to Pasta Idea, ask for Chef Chiara!  She is very good at what she does; and she is also very friendly!    Happy Eating! Ciao!",

Now for the Cons: Meatballs had absolutely no flavor, does not look homemade, looks like they're shipped in. The Garlic Bread was flavorless and soggy as well.  ** CAUTION ** Very pricey, they charge as much as if you ate a fine dining real Italian restaurant.

    "text": "Hey Out of Towners! If you are going to Las Vegas and looking for a truly wonderful homemade Italian meal (off of the Vegas Strip), this is THE PLACE to go! It's a great little 'hole in the wall!' nestled in the corner of a strip mall.  Pasta Idea is not fancy, but clean and bright.  There are maybe 8 tables for seating.  The owner is an Italian chef and he and his family are very kind and accommodating. Everything is fresh and make to order.  The Caprese salad was spectacular. with fresh, firm beef steak tomatoes, wonderful mozzarella cheese, mixed greens and a flavorful balsamic; easily big enough to serve 2 of us.  I loved the chicken piccata. When you order, you get to choose the kind of pasta you want with your dish (all the pasta is freshly made). There is a a separate charge for each pasta choice which was a little confusing when we saw the bill.  All and all, this place is well worth a visit and the prices are very reasonable.",

The dishes are prepared with such pride - the presentation and taste was better than any 5 star restaurant I have ever eaten in. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi over pappadelle served with grape tomatoes and baby asparagus. Just the way the asparagus was cut was impressive.. My friend ordered the cheese ravioli with pink diablo sauce- the dish had with pepperoni, sausage, peppers, pepperoncini and sundried tomatoes spicy - Amazing!  Sam- our waitress was great- Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "Oh. Yum.  Husband, daughter, and I all loved our dishes (and each other's). Even though we're just in town a few more days, it's likely we'll go back. It is pricier than your average lunch- but the food is far from average.  There are too many choices, because every single one sounds delicious, but somehow we honed in on our pasta/sauce combos pretty quick. The waiter was friendly and helpful, answering questions and providing tips when requested (he eats the food there).  The toast with fresh bruschetta was delicious (breads not fancy, but the bruschetta made up for it!)  The pasta came out pretty quickly, was hot and exquisite. Daughter got tricolor cheese tortellini with creamy basil pesto. Husband got bigoli (awesome thick spaghetti, that reminded me a bit of German spaetsle in texture) with carbonara, and I got butternut squash ravioli with the Veneto. I would probably pair the squash ravioli with something a little lighter.   Ultimately, I think you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I used to come here twice a week and bring friends and it was our FAVORITE place to eat! Food was amazing and the people were so nice. We took about a 2-3 month break over the Holidays and we were so disappointed when we came back. For starters, we were sad when we got here and didn't see our usual servers working. Then we picked our table only to realize that it was covered in ants.. when we told the waiter his respose was \"Oh, let me clean the table off for you\". Seriously? Just an oh... I was so grossed out! We still decided to stay unfortunately and just move to an ant-free table. There were 2 servers and it took a good while of us staring in their direction to get our order taken.. and when I asked for my sauce without pepperoncinis the women asked me 3 times what I was talking about before having to look at a menu to understand what I was asking. Ugh! So we finally get our food and we both ordered the same sauce, however mine was suuuper light and runny (way too much cream) and my boyfriend's was way darker and spicier. SO DISAPPOINTED!! Sad to say that this may be our last trip....",

So that is what we did and now will be making return trip after return trip to this Amazing Mom & Pop Italian Pasta Spot! Hand made Pastas and Sauces to die for. She had Fettuccine with Pink Diablo Sauce and I had lobster ravioli with clam and mussel red sauce. We had some amazing garlic bread and when I joking asked for a loaf of it the sop up the delicious sauce our waitress return with a plate of garlic beard which I put to use. I can not wait to go back and try a different combination of pasta and sauce. Vegas has some amazing Italian places and in my opinion Pasta Idea ranks right up the with best of them. Did I mention that both our plates were huge and it was under $50 for the entire dinner! simply fantastic.",
