They sat us and waiters walked by for 10 minutes. I flagged one down, he said he would be right back and I watched him help two more newer tables before he came back. I'm still here, it's been an hour and yet to have seen our drinks. We have had to get our own water. AVOID this place.",

It's nearly $50 for half a frozen king crab leg, which was still frozen when we got it, 2 oysters, 2 jumbo Shrimp, half a lobster tail that was stuck to the shell also still frozen when we received it, and 1 other shellfish.  I was definitely not impressed with that.  As a side I ordered SHMULEY'S EXTRAORDINARY MAC & CHEESE- which hands down was the best i have EVER had.. and I am a mac and cheese Snob.  food was overall very good.   Waiter didn't give me the correct dessert, but rather a 'to go' replacement, without ever informing me.   Neither were that great.  If they offered me a complimentary meal to make up for the poor and Expensive experience with the seafoodand switching my dessert, I'd happily go back and drop another 300$, but honestly, without an acknowledgement, I don't think I would bother.  I have another 3 days at the Plaza hotel,   I've thought about going back for the mac and cheese, but not sure I can justify that. lol",

    "text": "This was our 2nd time at Oscars.  Our first experience was an \"Oh Wow!\".  Our 2nd time there was a bit of a disappointment.  To start things off, the cocktail waitress inside the bar had no clue about the custom drinks on the menu.  She wasn't even familiar with the names of the drinks!  After ordering our cocktails, our table became available.  The hostess said that she would have the cocktail waitress bring our drinks to the table.  It took 15 minutes to finally get our drinks.  My martini was supposed to have bleu cheese olives; and it had regular olives instead.  I did finally get them; but it took the cocktail waitress a couple more requests and another 15 minutes.  I was also surprised that they couldn't transfer my bar tab to the dinner check.  Moving on to dinner, the seafood that my wife and mother ordered was very good.  My prime rib, the Oscar bone-in cut, was at least 50% fat!  This cut of meat should have never left the kitchen.  The real kicker is that it was cold.  Not just lukewarm or cool....but COLD.  I sent it back where I think they just poured hot au-jus on it because it still wasn't very warm.  As for the service, I was disappointed in our waiter.  He never even acknowledged my mother's birthday, even though I informed the hostess upon checking in (and tipped her $20!).  When the waiter brought my prime rib after I sent it back, he did not wait while I tested, nor did he ever check back to see if I was satisfied with my entree.  At the end of the meal, he commented as to how much of the prime rib was still left on the plate.  I replied that it was all fat that was left...and he simply laughed!  I expect excellent food and excellent service when enjoying a fine restaurant, especially when the average bill at Oscar's is around $100 per person.  I am sorry to say that I will not recommend this restaurant to others, nor will I go back.  One or two small mistakes, I can understand; but a series of them throughout the night is unacceptable!  The service and overall experience at Oscar's was just plain sloppy.  There are too many other amazing restaurants in Las Vegas that get it right every time.",

A table for two is set up so that you sit side by side like you are going to watch a show.  This is less intimate and makes it difficult to just have a nice dinner conversation.  It is also disappointing to see so many people show up to a nice steakhouse is shorts, t shirts and flip flops.  Why there is not a minimum dress code in the main restaurant is unknown because Oscars does have a pretty amazing old Las Vegas feel to it.   The steak was amazing (bone in rib eye for me, filet Oscar for my wife)  the portion size for sides are a bit off, almost too big for one person but too small to share.  The chopped salad was fresh and prepared just right.  We may go back but would request a table closer to the front window with less awkward seating.",

With a great atmosphere of old Las Vegas, waking through the Plaza casino, you're prepared for a night of enjoyment with food, music, and laughter.   We were a group of colleagues, and we had a wonderful time. Larry, the live musician, was fantastic. The service was impeccable, and the food...amazing. I ordered the Bone-in Tomahawk Ribeye, that's 42 oz of amazing meat. Ok, I ordered it to share, and still brought home plenty for another meal. The meat was top quality, cooked to juicy red medium rare perfection.   It's not the cheapest place in town, but I'm always one to say, \"you get what you pay for\".  If you want cheap and nasty, go to the other end of Fremont and eat at Heart Attack Grill.  (You'll regret it afterward).   To top off our evening, Hizzonor, Mayor Goodman himself was in the house!  You certainly WON'T regret spending the extra and enjoying yourself at Oscar's.",

I love feeling like I'm part of an experience rather than just sitting down for a meal. This restaurant is near the Golden Nugget and you get a view of the people zip lining in the strip (whatever it's called - I don't know much about downtown Vegas). The service was decent enough but we didn't really feel like the waitress came around that often. Fortunately our glasses were always filled with water thanks to the other members of the staff. The filet I had that evening was better than I had the night before (yes, I wanted to clog my arteries by having steak two nights in a row). The other side items were okay. I had a baked potato with butter and sour cream but the butter wouldn't melt because the potato wasn't really that hot). And no, I didn't want to have it taken back because we were on a schedule and I didn't want to be late for Hamilton. Overall, it was an okay experience. Again, I'll reiterate that the steak was delicious! I'd like to go in the evening so I can get the full ambiance. There were some very interesting patrons at Oscar's. People watching alone would be fun!",

Our dinner also felt super rushed. They brought our appetizer, before we even finished they brought the salads, then before we finished our salads they brought the steaks. I finished my steak before my boyfriend and they brought my birthday dessert before he was even done with his steak. We aren't slow eaters either; they were just piling our food up very quickly instead of spacing it out the way fancy restaurants usually do. The manager, Justin, was really nice though.",

    "text": "I really don't think this steakhouse is anything to write home about. It's really mediocre at best. The filet cut was sub-par, I wouldn't even call it a USDA choice cut. I noticed on the menu there were only a few cuts that they labeled distinctly Prime. This leads me to have a strong hunch the meats are just regular USDA cuts, and most likely not aged or anything of that sorts.  As for the sides, they were ok - I can quite frankly make better mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. It just wasn't really there as much as it tried.   The one positive of this place would be the view. You have a nice view of Fremont street which is really cool I'd say. Other than that, I've had better experiences at numerous other steakhouses.",

    "text": "Scored a Travelzoo $99.00 certificate to spend $165.00.  Made reservation a couple weeks ago for tonight, and it was worth the wait. We arrived just a couple minutes before our reservation and were immediately greeted by two beautiful young ladies.  They show my wife and I our table and immediately started service. We were waited on by a delightful young lady by the name of Tasha, and our bus boy/assistant Alfredo. They were both cheery and nice to be around.  Both had a great sense of humor. The wife started off with a Vesper Martini and I had a Laphroaig scotch neat with one ice cube. Drinks arrived very quickly.  Then the eating began with the crab cake and calamari appetizers, both very good.  We ordered a stuffed shrimp for the wife and I ordered an Oscar style bone in prime rib.  I ordered the caramelized onions and blue cheese with my prime.  Both very good but just way too much onions.  The blue cheese was spectacular.  We also had sides of Brussels sprouts and bacon along with the clean face onion rings.  We were constantly checked on by Tasha and Alfredo.  We also had a couple visits from the manager, who was also the executive chef from the hotel.  Didn't get his name but he was very nice.  We topped the meal off by sharing a  Tiramisu.  It was absolutely one of the best we have ever had.  All in all it was just an wonderful meal and evening.  Want to go back one night for happy hour.",

So tender and the blue cheese was on point-they didn't skimp on it either. Our waitress was great, I didn't get her name but she was friendly, funny and split up our bill into multiple credit cards since we had 7 people in our group and she was more than accommodating. The sides were decent but the steak was the star of the show. The view is great and the inside is really cool with the windows and view of downtown. If you love steak I def recommend Oscars and the prices were cheaper than a lot of steak houses on the strip.",

My gin martini with blue cheese stuffed olives paired so well with the food!  The old school vibe and all the photos add to this steakhouse's appeal!

    "text": "Oh Oscar Goodman, I do love you! And now you have your own steakhouse, with the tag line of \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\", I love you even more!   I finally had the chance to visit Oscar's on my last trip home.  It was a great experience and I loved everything about this place.  Here are the highlights:  1. The menu! The menu is full of classic steakhouse fares.  They have your fancy steaks, seafood, and lots of tasty sides.  What kicks this menu up a notch is that many of the items are named after Vegas big wigs and many known Mafia figures.  Gotta love Oscar and his style!  2. Great location! This resturant is located in the Plaza at the head of Fremont street.  The resturant is in a big glass dome, so you get some great views of Fremont Street, even if the new zip line blocks some of it these days.   3. Fantastic service! The service here is top notch. From start to finish, we had a great time!  4. Tasty food! On this visit, we had a filet with Oscar topping, the Spilatro steak (named after Tony Spilatro or the guy played by Joe Pesci in the movie Casino), Mac n' cheese, cream corn brulee, and the sweet potato fries. The filet Oscar was fabulous! The Spilatro steak, which is a flank steak stuffed with garlic and marinated in garlic and red pepper flakes, was ok.  The taste was good, but it was a bit tough, which is normal with flank steak.  I don't think I would order it again, but it was a fun steak to try.  The sides were all unbelievably fantastical in taste. Very top notch, in my book.   5. Oscar's is on OpenTable, so you can make your own reservations and get points for it too!  I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for tasty food, great service, and who loves Fremont Street.  I also would recommend this place because you have a chance of an Oscar siting, which would be awesome to anyone who knows Vegas Mafia history or have watched Casino.",

My initial instinct that something was askew was when I first walked in and said hi to a server. I said \"How you doing?\" He replied with \"happy to be employed.\" They next offloaded their 75 dollar (w tax) porterhouse special on me with onion rings, veggies, and mac and cheese. The steak was a horrendous cut, the meat was cooked incorrectly, the mac and cheese tasted like it came from a box, the onion rings were fast food quality and without sauce. The complimentary bread was dry and cold. The water was ok but the refill was half of what it should have been. The server poured the last little bit from the pitcher but forgot to return and finish pouring me a glass. The waiter was slow and also seemed annoyed when I asked for sauce with the onion rings. The waiter didn't even ask me how my meal was (and the place was nearly empty). In fact, the only time the waiter moved quickly was when it came to bringing the check and even then he handed me a pen that didn't write. I said to him too \"not only did I just have the worst steak of my life but you give me a pen that doesn't write.\"",

After Channel 3's restaurant critic added Oscar's to his Valentines Day (2015) rec, I decided it was time to give this place another try.  Actually....it was wayyyyy past time to give it another spin. What a wonderful turn around. Service was stellar, thanks to Lenore. Server Lenore was a perfect balance of decorum and warmth. Her service made a nice meal seem all that more special and we will always request her in the future.The manager stopped by our table a few times to check on us...which is a very nice touch and much appreciated  A good bottle of wine was presented quickly and the evening flowed beautifully from there. Crab cakes were lovely and generous in size and crab meat. Wedge salad was crisp and well dressed with Maytag blue cheese. Carolyn's cut prime rib was generous and a perfect medium rare. Giant baker was a great side to share for two...or more.  Impersonator, \"Robert De Niro\" added some fun to a perfect evening, We can't wait to bring some out of town friends  to visit with \"Bobby\" while enjoying the ambiance of a great dinner with a wonderful old school Las Vegas vibe. Nicely done Oscar!  We will be back.......",

But the bread was cold and we had to ask for it after 20 minutes and still no water or drinks. There was no manager on duty (\"he is in and out and we never know where to find him\" is a direct quote from one of the servers!).  The food was so under done it was \"mooing\", the strip steak was so overdone it was like shoe leather (and still - good luck finding a manager).

    "text": "We find ourselves in downtown pretty often because of out-of-town visitors who like to stay at hotels on the Fremont. This place always made me curious because honestly it seems too fancy for the Plaza. On the other hand, I heard from a co-worker that the food here was actually good. So on one random night, a few hours before the restaurant opened, we made a last minute decision to eat here. I called and was able to get a reservation. The restaurant is located on the second floor in a dome that is overlooking Fremont Street. Apparently, the location used to be the hotel's swimming pool back in the day.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a table by the window, but that's okay. We could still see all of Fremont at our table in the middle of the room. Service was great. Our server was friendly and was very knowledgeable with the menu. The other servers were very attentive as well, taking away empty plates immediately and refilling our drinks promptly. Here is what we ordered:  -Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes: very good! Hot, tasty, and we liked how it was basically just crab. There were a few pieces of red peppers in there but you could barely taste them. The mustard sauce was a nice touch as well. -Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese: our server said it was made with 5 types of cheese, but it was very bland. Something to avoid. -Steamed Asparagus: my husband said that they weren't very good and it was a bit cold. -Joey C's Filet Mignon (8 oz): this was awesome! Cooked right and very easy to cut. It was very flavorful and melt in your mouth good! -Prime Rib (Carolyn's Cut): my husband ordered this and enjoyed it. His favorite restaurant for Prime Rib will always be Lawry's, but he said it was pretty close!  i was looking forward to dessert, but their kitchen went down while we were there. Our server said that the fans in the kitchen stopped working and they kept setting off the fire alarms in the hotel. We were one of the lucky tables to get our food. The staff was apologizing to other customers who didn't have a chance to order anything.   I would come back again for sure because of the great steak and service. Maybe next time we can convince family members to come along and hope that they will take care of the bill! :P  FYI - they do have a dress code: business casual.",

    "text": "I was in town for work with a couple other guys.  We were looking for a good steak with a halfway reasonable price when we found this place.  The atmosphere is great. When we walked in their was a guy on the piano and a lady singing some old time 40s style music.  I was immediately excited that we found the right place.   We were seated up in the overlook area where the views of the old Las Vegas strip and Fremont street were awesome.  The place was at most half full when we arrived so not to busy.  THEN we waited and waited and waited for some one just to say hi and maybe pour us some water.  I watched our waiter walk by multiple times before I had to loudly call to him to get his attention as he passed again to get him to acknowledge we even existed.   I expected him to come right to us but he said he would be right there and we waited more.   This ruined the start.   FINALLY when we got some attention and he was a nice enough guy.  Kind of rough which maybe maybe didn't make sense to the atmosphere it was a little confusing.   Ultimately once we got service it was quick.  Drinks stayed full and the food was delivered quickly.  I'm from Texas so I have had great steaks.  I had the 46$ 12oz filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly and was a good tasting piece of meat.  They could have seasoned it a little better but all in all it was a good tasting piece of meat.   The 46$ steak comes with nothing, no sides at all.  All of those are extra!  What!!  At 9$ average each you can get some not so good sides.  We tried the steamed asparagus ( no taste ), the potato wedges which I found odd tasting ang aw grotten potatoes which again were just \"ok\" at best.  Strangely you can get a Sam Adams beer for 5$.  Lol.  So everything is overpriced except the beer.    All in all I'm glad we went but it's because of the atmosphere of the area.  I'd maybe do it again.  I definitely visit Fremont street again.  That place is great!  I give it a 3 star because of the service and while the steak was 4 star all the sides were 3.",

Note to our waiter \"listening skills\"   Last time we split every dish was separated and equally plated. This time he hacked into the steak at the table. Presentation ruined! Steak knifes came after the steak, when does that happen in a steak house? When he came to check on us, it wasn't until I had to reach out to the manager. By that time all our food was cold. When the waiter came to apologize, he said if the chef had to slice it in the kitchen, it would be an extra charge. I challenge him to find that button on the POS  system. If that was not bad enough, when the check came the waiter was swarming around my table like a shark on the hunt. Clearly this experience was not about our celebration, but our waiter.",

I took my Fiance out for a staycation to Fremont st and ventured down to Oscar's as she loves the \"old Vegas\" feel of downtown. We had a window seat and the tint on the window makes the view a gold yellow antique feel as you watched the crowd shuffling down on the street. I couldn't have asked for much better than that.  The food, Awesomely cooked to perfection filet mignon. Good Mac n Cheese, great mashed potatoes so creamy and rich I could have eaten them all night. The fiance had a great looking salad and a huge baked potato with tons of liquid butter you couldn't take a bite without dumping butter on the table.   Service was poor however. Our waiter we guessed evaluated us as a two top and minimum tip and spent much more time interacting with the 4 & 7 tops in his section. They were offered specials, we received a pitty smile. Our glasses were empty most of the dinner, glad I brought in a bottle of water. They were served multiple drinks and bottles of wine. My beer was empty and no second was offered.  When we finished I wanted desert but skipped it as we then spent at least 15 mins with empty plates and glasses before the bus lady came to clear the table without our receiving the bill yet.  We mentioned the service on the way out and the manager wanted to make it right lower the bill etc but we refused. The food was spectacular and that was all that saved our experience here.",

    "text": "Another really fine steak house in downtown Las Vegas.  Downtown has been working overtime to shed its image as the place where busloads of white haired old ladies go to play penny slots, and high on the list of improvements are some really first rate restaurants that rival anything on the Strip.  Oscar's, at the Plaza, is one such.  The room itself is stunning, with its floor to ceiling glass dome and its views of Fremont Street.  We arrived on the early side, hoping to get a window table fronting Fremont, and we did.  We didn't even have to ask.  The hostess was very nice, and took us right to the best table in the room.  Our waiter, Scott, took our drink orders promptly.  I tend to pay attention to the bread basket in restaurants, because I think it shows attention to detail (or lack thereof).  The bread at Oscar's was a fabulous fresh-baked loaf of onion bread.  We raved about it, and on our way out Scott brought us two loaves of complimentary bread to take home with us.  Scott was very attentive throughout the meal, and was both helpful with the menu and personable in chatting about things like the history of the room - it seems it used to be the site of the Plaza's rooftop pool.    The menu has quite a few twists, which are going to leave you either adoring the food, or thinking that it isn't quite right.  For example, my wife and I both started with the onion soup, which was made with veal stock - my wife loved it, while I thought it was a little salty (veal stock will do that).  Next, I had the crab cakes which were quite large and served with two very good sauces, but which were a little short on lump crab meat.  My wife had the wedge salad, which Scott had chopped at her request, and enjoyed it.  It was a bit heavy on the blue cheese, which made it strongly flavored.  My entree was the bone-in rib eye, which was a fine steak - flavorful and properly cooked, but a little heavy on the fat and gristle in the cap.  It was not the best steak I have had, but it was pretty good.  My wife had the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp, which she thought were excellent.  Both of us had plenty of food left to take home for dinner tomorrow night.  Prices - my steak was on the high side of what similar restaurants charge, but much of the menu was a pretty good deal.  In our case, the good deal aspect was given a boost by a TravelZoo voucher, which allowed us to get out the door for under $200, tax, tip, drinks and wine included.  To top it off, complimentary valet parking at the Plaza was (unexpectedly) a breeze.  We were very satisfied, and we will be back.",

My company is having a holiday party tonight and I realized in all the Christmas Chaos that a gift certificate issued by Oscar's was set to expire. The fantastic Natashia White was extremely helpful, polite, and honestly made my Christmas season so much better.  In a world where customer service usually consists of a rather rude individual putting you on hold for an eternity, I can't speak highly enough of Natashia and everyone at Oscar's. If every business were run this way, we would be a much better city. There is no doubt in my mind that we will go here again and I will certainly refer others as well.   A big \"thank you\" and \"Merry Christmas\" to Oscar's and Natashia.",

    "text": "Now that my recent 3-star reviews are out of the way, I can share a new, surprisingly enjoyable find before I enter a short period of temporary hibernation.  The place is Oscar's Beef  Booze Broads.  Yes, our previous mayor's steakhouse that opened to some disappointment and poor Yelp reviews!  I'm glad I waited until some kinks were taken out of the delivered product.  I'm sure I experienced marked improvement on my recent visit, because I was quite impressed by my dining experience here.  All was not perfect, but overall it was a 4-1/2-star dining experience.  Let's begin at the beginning.  For starters I selected Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes, which featured large hunks of fresh lump crabmeat, Stoned Ground Dijon Mustard Sauce, and Pepper Remoulade.  The pair of crab cakes had very little filler as our waiter had declared, and the Pepper Remoulade was especially mellow and tasty as an accent to go with the crab.  Next up for me was Crazy Phil's Onion Soup.  At first I was a little disappointed in its physical appearance because, unlike most classic Onion Soups Gratinee, this crock of soup did not have a crusty crown of cheese overlaying the broth.  But once I tasted this beauty, my initial negative visual impression went quickly out of mind.  Made with sherry infused white wine, veal stock, a deconstructing crouton, and Gruyere Cheese, the sweet broth and other ingredients were simply delicious.  This was a truly outstanding and hot French Onion Soup!  Complimentary Onion Bread with visible pink onions was also very good as a starter, but I didn't want to continue eating Onion Bread all night, so I backed off after downing two slices with butter.  Oscar's Chopped Salad was artistically crafted in a nicely shaped circular mound of creamed up chopped vegetables topped by sprouting Onion Straws.  The salad, containing Grape Tomatoes, carrot shavings, Italian Squash, and mostly diced zucchini tossed with Maytag Bleu Cheese was cool, creamy, and refreshing.  An interesting twist then occurred as large steak knives were laid out for the men in my dining party, while much more slender and petite steak knives were set out for the women.  (See pic.)  Diane bridled a bit at this, and so I asked our server why females were not provided the same knives as males.  With a serious expression, he replied that it was more appropriate to furnish the men with \"a manly man's knife,\" and women with \"an elegant lady's knife.\"  I suppose whether a person views this practice as sexist or chivalrous depends on one's point of view.  It also could be deliberately done a bit tongue in cheek, reflecting upon the image of \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\" which the restaurant plays up rather than down in a whimsical sort of way.  Soon after we were seated, a comely, white-gloved buxom blonde in a lacy black gown came over to welcome us; she said she was \"one of the broads.\"  (See pic.)  My slightly charred medium-rare Filet was cooked perfectly, and went well with a very tasty house-made Bearnaise Sauce.  A large King Crab Leg that Diane and I split was warm rather than hot, and not very sweet; and the Drawn Butter to go with it was not very hot either.  But Lobster Mashed Potatoes were very hot and very good, except for the two tiny pieces of shell that were encountered.  Wild Mushrooms were a very good second topping for my steak, as I made sure that my stomach was fully indulged this particular night.  And to complete a fine meal, the oven-baked Apple Cobbler with Cinnamon Bread Crumbs that I chose, which was made in a La Cocotte Staub all-metal Dutch oven and served with a strawberry, raspberries, and blackberries on the side, and with two large scoops of quickly melting Vanilla Ice Cream on top, was as delicious as it sounds!  With many tables and booths facing the Fremont Street Experience and sumptuously decorated, amid a nice airy ambiance, with white-tied waiters taking orders  under a glass ceiling, this is one classy place turning out memorable meals.  Hizzoner should be proud of his new downtown eating palace!",

The most delicious wine-I'm still searching for that merlot! Our appetizers of shrimp (the biggest shrimp I've ever seen) and spicy cocktail sauce was superb...chicken meatballs? Are you sure they were chicken? They had so much flavor! Bread on the table was scrumptious....my guest ordered pork chops and they looked good-he cringed paying over $30 for pork chops, lol but that's a Vegas steakhouse for ya..! My prime rib was good-but not amazing-a tad disappointing. Not tender, lacking a heavy spice on the edges. I just was anticipating the best prime rib ever...but I will keep searching. Our sides of au gratin potatoes was very cheesy and made for super yummy leftover late night snack. Dessert of cheesecake was also just okay, we prefer a denser cheesecake and tangy-ness. But, I do recommend this place and the view of Fremont. I would try again and order something different as an entree. We had a wonderful time together and again our waiter was so cool.",

For $100+ per person, I should NEVER have to ask for refills on water, wine or cocktails.  I would imagine that at any resort, the first questions a server would ask would be about where we are from and what brought us to that property.  This was not the case.  Thank goodness the neglect of our server was over shadowed by the food.    The food runners on the other hand were quick, knowledgeable and running their cute butts off!  Oscars, you need to train your servers to pay attention to the fact that they work in a 3 star steakhouse in Las Vegas.  They give service that is less attentive then the Outback down the street from me.  I'd love to return for those crab cakes, prime rib and Mac and cheese, but I'll take my business back down Freemont to Vic & Anthony's.",

Signature cocktails with names that pay homage to Vegas' mob history are the perfect compliment to a room that features a vintage Vegas feel.  If you are visiting and want CLASSIC Las Vegas...leave The Strip and head to Fremont Street and Oscar's in The Plaza.   If you're a local like me, don't overlook this Las Vegas institution.

I walked around the restaurant and looked at all of Oscar's pictures with famous people. However when I went to the lounge bar area I was never greeted by any employee. It's like I was ignored. So I sat at the bar so I could use my Yelp check in offer of buy any item and get a glass of wine free.  When the frazzled bartender actually came over to me I told him I just flew in and want to use my Yelp offer. The guy pretended he knew nothing about it and treated me like some poor guy looking for a freebie. He said \"yelp offer\" what's that?  I showed him my phone and he immediately ran over to a manager on the other side of the restaurant. A manager finally comes over and without introducing himself tells me that I must \"dine in\" to use my yelp check in deal. I asked him where it said that showing him the yelp deal on the phone. He could care less and left. This place has snob employees and like most fancy places only care about money even though I told both of the employees I was ordering a Cobb salad with the free glass of wine. They could care less about the regular customers and focus on the rich people that go here. Not my style. Total discrimination. I told the cocky manager on they way out I would post the event on yelp. He turned his back and walked away. Billionaire Oscars restaurant can't honor a free glass of wine to a customer who just arrived off of a flight. Plus I ordered a $11 Cobb salad. Total joke. Snobs at this place. Not gracious or friendly at all. Really sad. They should know better. Thx Oscar Goodman for the wonderful experience at your \"finest steakhouse in Vegas\" restaurant. Hope u make even more money and neglect non rich people. What a joke",

I wrote this in my notes when I submitted the reservation through open table and the waiter immediately acknowledged the special occasion. I also noted that I would love a window seat to see Freemont street and they gave us the best seat in the place.  The ambiance was very nice and it felt like old Las Vegas.....the whole restaurant was made of windows. The service was great and the food was very good as well. I had a  hard time finding a good steakhouse that we wouldn't have to pay an arm and a leg and this was exactly the place. We had the filet and new york strip with the corn brulee and mac & cheese on the side.  Everything was great. Their onion bread, complimentary with dinner, was amazing!They even brought us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary. Would go again.",

Darn shame the Fremont street experience zip line loading zone blocks a lot of the view that must have been fabulous in the restaurant's former glory. There's still a view though and we were seated with a nice one. Even the bar has a nice atmosphere. I'd recommend going with the classics here. Prime rib, crab cakes, etc. they do those solidly. Service is attentive. they take table waiting seriously. Prices are average for a steakhouse. Cocktail and wine choices are middle of the road for the most part but there are a few gems amongst the them. Make sure you dine at least partially after sundown for full effect as you sit in that crazy old globe!",

They played back with our bantering and were very helpful with our questions. Everyone at the table ordered something different. The chopped salad was wonderful. The onion rings were touted on the menu that it would feed the table, but there were only 5 in the basket. The scallops, prime rib, and risotto were top notch. But two people at our table had beef, one was undercooked the other was overcooked.   The undercooked was sent back and was still undercooked. How can a restaurant as nice as this not cook steak correctly?  And no military discount??  But I did appreciate the birthday dessert.",

I love how it is dome shaped and you can see out into the hustle and bustle of Fremont St. yet be surrounded in elegance. Beautiful atmosphere. Great place to go on a date or with good friends.   Appetizers: Asparagus: cooked perfectly: crisp and seasoned well Artichokes: Delicious (one of my fave) Calamari: DELICIOUS My other fave, best i've ever had Crab Cakes: husband really liked it Bread: Perfection, warm, served with butter Shrimp: delicious  Rib-Eye Steak: medium rare, so juicy, flavorful with every bite, tender and cooked perfectly  Dessert: We tried everything!  Creme Brulee: Best i've ever had. Delicious custard taste, rich and satisfying  Cookie: My favorite along with the Creme Brulee! SOOO yummy oooey chocolate chip gooey goodness  New York Cheesecake: Both the crust and the filling were amazing, must try!  Apple Pie Crisp: seems like a simple dessert, but it was actually delicious, fresh and cozy at the same time. Flavors were well balanced.  Chocolate Cake: rich and chocolatey, if you are a chocolate lover this one is for you  Chocolate Mousse: I normally don't order dessert like this but this was amazing and I would come back for this.  Tiramisu: If you are a coffee lover this one is for you! Not my favorite of the bunch.   By the time we were done with dinner, we were all waddling out. The wait staff was AMAZING to handle 13 people! They were so fast and attentive. The food came out in perfect timing. Absolutely no complaints. Everything was perfect. I was in heaven. This restaurant did such an amazing job- it's always nice to enjoy wonderful company and have no interruptions of any kind. Just pure enjoyment and delicious food. Outstanding. I cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I write this review for Oscar's.  I'm like most Las Vegans and adore our former mayor. I want everything Oscar Goodman touches to turn to gold. And I have such a high regard for his taste, that this restaurant, at least in my mind, should be one of the best steakhouses in town.  As it stands, I'll have to tell people to avoid it.  In short, after the \"case of the raw gratin potatoes\", I can say with certainly that I won't be back to Oscar's.   This was my second trip to Oscars and when I visited last year, I enjoyed the steaks and sides. While I did not love any of it, I was so taken with the ambiance, the style, and use of the space that there was no question that I would be back.  There is no other place like this in our city--they serve great drinks in an iconic space. And it manages to capture that glamorous feeling of old-Vegas.   We didn't see any broads this visit, but one can't help but enjoy the view and the established feeling of it all.   The problem on the return trip was the food. Period. In fairness, I came to a steakhouse and ate the salmon, so feel free to disregard my comments, but my experiences speak to an overall level of quality.   Here's the thing---while I was satisfied with my piece of fish and hubby was pleased with his fillet, no one else was happy with the quality of their protein. Our friend with the shrimp dish found the shrimp to be overcooked and our friends with prime rib stated (and it was visually obvious) that it was not presented at the temperatures requested.  Those things I could overlook, and was ready to overlook even as we talked and laughed and ate, but the there was snafu with one side dish that I am still shocked by. The au gratin was a disaster.  We received a pale looking item in a small ramekin type dish. I had the first scoop when it hit the table and it was cool. Not completely ice cold, but slightly cooler than room temperature.  And there was not one piece of melted cheese on the dish. Even the top was a creamy white chopped mix. There was no sprinkle of yellow or bunt orange or crusty brown anywhere. I still took a bite because my brain hadn't processed what was wrong with the dish. The flavor was disconcerting--it was bitter. I chewed and offered a bite to another table mate to get a second opinion. She agreed that something was wrong with the dish, but neither of us spent too much time thinking about it as we ate.    We were celebrating that night and didn't want to think about the potatoes that were...crunchy and toothsome and the fact that there seemed to be no cheese. Before the waitress came to pick up the dishes I stated to the table that I thought the dish might have been raw. But with the conversation shifting and Occam's razor in full effect, I talked myself out of that ridiculous guess. We were celebrating Brad's birthday and I didn't want to spend any more time bemoaning a weak dish. People were dissatisfied enough with the main dishes that they had already eaten and I didn't want to add to anyone's dissatisfaction.  But the raw gratin kept gnawing at me. Was I wrong? Was this how they served their potatoes? When I got home, I went through some Yelp photos of others' experiences looking specifically for a picture of their au gratin potatoes. I can count the number of times I have ordered and/or eaten them, so I didn't trust the clear voice telling me the ugly truth.   One look at Dennis T's pic of a yellow, golden cheesy crust that had clearly been baked in the dish provided all of the evidence I needed in the case of the \"raw gratin\". They had absolutely served us raw au gratin.   Add to that the fact that hubby asked for a Diet Coke and was served a Diet Pepsi. I don't fault them for serving Pepsi products, but why didn't our server stop and clarify at the time the order was placed?    Mid-meal a manager came by and asked how everything was. There were an awkward few moments of silence and one friend stated flatly, \"It's OK.\" And the manager never followed up.   Mistakes happen and certainly are forgivable. But for this mistake to go unnoticed  means that someone in the kitchen put them up raw, the expediter and/or secondary server saw them and found them acceptable to served to use and they were placed on our table raw and pale and anemic . Then when we were finished, our waitress saw the generally untouched pure white raw gratin and never said a word.   That's a problem for me. I can easily forgive a raw dish at a casual diner (although I've never been served one) or at a mom and pop spot (although I've never been served one). But not at an \"upscale\" steakhouse \"tailored to meet the tastes of even the most discerning diners\".   In fairness to Oscar's, I called and let a manger know about the issue the next day.  But the damage is done. There was a breakdown in both the food preparation and in the service. There are too many great steakhouses in this town for me to seek out another experience at Oscar's.",

    "text": "Welcome to Oscar's. We arrived early and checked in then went to the bar for a beverage. The Bar tender was friendly and responsive and had great recommendations for their craft cocktails. When our party was finally all together we contacted hostess and was promptly seated. There were several large parties so it was a little loud. Our drink orders were taken and were not exactly promptly brought. Our waitress was Lenore and our bus person was Maria. This may sound trite, but when asking for a diet coke most places ask if Diet Pepsi okay. Oscar's did not ask and some in our party do not care for Diet Pepsi. They should specify. (or Not??). I like that the Menu is one piece of paper on a cardboard backing. Finally our drinks arrive. We did not order wine because our waitstaff never returned after we said we were deciding on wine. Once they did return we just decided to order our main courses. Our orders; Manny's stuffed shrimp. Shrimp was over cooked and tough to even cut. flavor lacked seasoning. Josie ordered Prime Rib medium  with Caesar Salad, Salad bland did not have capers, but that is a probably a taste I like in the salad but not many do it that way anymore. Her Prime Rib was more rare than medium was tough and lacked favor as well. I also ordered Prime Rib Mid Rare which came more rare (I can mostly be okay with that). Blue Cheese wedge.(Bleu). Could have used more dressing but the cheese crumbles were sufficient. Also a wedge to me is old fashioned wedge not one that is broken in four parts on plate. The other guests had 8oz Filet (more like 4oz). It was cooked correctly with good flavor but lacked a few ounces. Cedar Planked Blackened Salmon, Cooked a little more done than our guest liked however the flavor was good. Wonder if strong seasoning covers lack of a great cook on the fish. We had the three sides for $20. Steamed Asparagus, this was salted but it seamed like an after thought not cooked in for flavor(cooking 101). So no real flavor, however, properly cooked. Smashed Potatoes, Warm around edges and cold in the middle and bland to the taste. Finally Potatoes Au Gratin, Not sure what this really was. It seamed like half shredded potatoes and whole. Had a white cheese on top and as the Smashed, cold in the middle. These potatoes also had a funky flavor and a texture that is unable to explain. At one point we had a Manger(we assume) stop and ask how things were. We responded with \"It's Okay\". No real response to this and she rambled on with some touristy rambling about our seat location. Not sure what this interaction was(Awkward, uncomfortable). In to the side dishes, we were told they were share size so I imagined A family style big plate. Each one except for Asparagus was more of a decent size for a side dish.  Since it was my Birthday they brought me a piece of Cheesecake with a candle. The Cheesecake tasted like it had been defrosted recently and had that freezer burn taste you get once thawed. The candle may have tasted better. For the most part our wait staff was attentive and drinks were kept filled.  We had great expectations and half our party had been before and said it was quite different. As a rule we are just simple blue collar people who save up to go out and have a meal beyond our normal budget. Sometimes our meals are worth the expense, this, however was not. No photos, nothing stood out as a wow factor. Maybe the cook staff was focused on the big parties and we just took a back seat to the good food.  Goodbye Thank you for coming. We did not have an Exit farewell from the staff. (We may have left from the wrong door maybe). I can say I will not be back. The hype was not as good as reality. No Broads...I thought they had some showgirls or something. I can not recommend going here unless you like over priced, bland, over/under cooked, and freezer burnt food.",

I would add another for the great company I was with but that wouldn't really be a review or a reflection of the restaurant :p  The whole experience was rather \"meh.\"  Our server was slow and I did not appreciate his upselling.  As for the food, I've had better steak, bread, and sides at just about every other steakhouse I've been to.  We each ordered filet mignon and shared our sides - creamed spinach, corn brulee, and garlic potato wedges.  Our complimentary bread was an onion bread which I personally wasn't too crazy about.  I liked the garlic potato wedges the best which basically just tasted like a cut-up baked potato.  Btw they ran out of the prime rib over an hour before closing which one of my dining companions was set on ordering so that was rather disappointing.  The cherry on top had to be the loud drunk guys at the table next to us making some sort of comments about Asian people.  How's that for ambience? :/  If anything come for the view but know that you can get better food and service elsewhere.",

Pretty good but we would have rather ordered dinner. Has that going out of business feel to it.  Very expensive. Booze prices well more than double the rest of Fremont St. Especially if you like premium or high premium drinks you'll really pay through your ass.  Not a destination that's for sure. The Plaza itself still has that ghetto, ashtray-stink, piss and lysol smelly, bus-station-in-defeat atmosphere that lingers in and sticks to you.  Can't imagine every going back especially with several other much better places to choose from just a short walk / $6 Uber ride away.",

First Issue~ seated ourselves in the bar....no one approached us, a manager did walk past us, after 12 min my husband got up asked the hostess if there was a cocktail service? She responded yes & pointed to a girl talking to friends at the bar....we did finally get our drinks delivered by the manager who walked past us 20 min earlier.. No napkins & NO olives in the Martini       The table behind was having similar service issues, until someone who is running for Judge joined them, then their service was golden~ except NO cocktail napkins either~  WTF? Even dive bars in the middle of nowhere give u a napkin under ur Beer      Our server (who needs training and lots of it!) Tosha recognized our displeasure & did comp our drinks. Which was nice, however we took our business to the \"D\" and enjoyed cocktails WITH NAPKINS, OLIVES, APPETIZERS, and the BEST SERVICE EVER FROM ALI~ the bartender @ Adiamo's!",

Their drink selection is fair, ranging from Coors lights to IPAS, martinis, champagne, whiskey, vodka and mixed drinks. We also ordered a few appetizers which were made quickly and were extremely tasty.  While at the bar we were advised if we want to return for dinner its best to make a reservation. This turned out to be sound advice. On Saturday its a happening place.  Give it a shot. Live piano music, great view, great steaks, great romantic atmosphere. You will not be disappointed.",

Our waitress was fabulous and the manager made it right and comped our meal.  I believe the hair in my crab cake was a random mishap that is not common place.  Good job Oscar's!",

    "text": "The hubby and I were wandering around Fremont st thinking of what/where to eat. This has been on our \"try\" list for a while. So we decided to stop in. Even though it was dinner time on the weekend, we didn't have a wait.   They seated us in the dining room facing main st. I have to say, Slotzilla is a monstrosity & eyesore and not a great view for the steakhouse. Even worse, from the restaurant you get the worst view of the eyesore-the back of it. Ughhh. I know it's not the restaurants fault & no stars deducted on this note.   The service was decent throughout the night. Our server was attentive, brought the food, and followed up. There were a couple of ladies (the broads? Lol) - not Oscars customary showgirls- walking around talking to diners. They asked if we're local, do we know why it's called oscars, do you know who Oscar is, etc. Im not a huge fan of being bothered while I'm eating out. But maybe the tourists get a kick out of the history tidbits.   The food was pretty good, not 5 star quality, but good nonetheless. They serve complimentary onion bread for starters. I had the bone in ribeye ($68) and my husband had the pork chops. Both were tasty, but the ribeye cost rivals strip competitors who are offering a higher quality steak for comparable prices. I would rather go to delmonicos for the same price. The price on the pork chops was reasonable given the quality though. For sides (served in shareable portions a la carte) , we opted for the super healthy options of au gratin and mac & cheese. Both were good, but next time we'll get one and share it.   Overall, the steakhouse is a decent option on Fremont street. But not the best one in town. I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here either.  If I do go back I'll try something else easier on the wallet to see if it's worth it (the bone in ribeye was the most expensive cut of meat on the menu).",

Nothing special about the salad or dressing except for some crushed walnuts that went surprisingly well with lettuce.  Second course, bland pumpkin soup.  It was terrible actually. Imagine pumpkin pie without sugar or cinnamon. It was just thick orange slop.  Third course, turkey dinner!  If I was a betting man I would say that it was processed turkey and not made from an actual turkey looking thing that you ate on Thanksgiving.  The plate was served with cranberry sauce, stuffing, baby onions, mashed sweet potatoes, and tiny zucchinis. I have no idea what they were thinking with the onions and sweet potatoes.  Last course, desert!  I took my apple streusel to go. It was okay.  For $55 I expected better tasting food.  The staff was professional and very attentive.  I'm not sure I'd go back for another meal.",

You should expect a steak on average to cost you around $50. Everything is a la carte. The view, by the way, is awesome. This is a must try if it's within your budget.",

We were there early, but I imagine if it was later that you could see the light show.  Since we had early reservations, it wasn't very busy, but our service was pretty slow. I enjoyed the food, but bit into a shell in the crab corn chowder. I told the server and I thought for sure a restaurant like that would take it off the bill, but nothing happened. That was disappointing for me and not what I would expect from a very nice steakhouse.  They do have a shuttle to/from Smith Center if you're going to a show. Our driver was great!",

Starting with that bit of info because their website says ladies get half off drinks on Thursdays... we were informed they are no longer doing that (they should probably take that blurb off their menu). Happy hour (goes until 7pm) includes white and red house wine, well drinks, several beers and select appetizers.  Service was a bit underwhelming. The waitress was almost throwing herself at the table of men next to us and barely paying attention to us.  That being said, the food at this place made up for it. The crab cake app had so much crab meat in it I'd happily pay regular price for them! Their homemade ricotta was delicious and paired nicely with the tomato mix. we ran out of the crustinis but were still scooping the cheese, tomato mix with our silverware. Calamari was nice and crispy (not as amazing as the other two but those were hard to beat).  Happy hour white wine was a chardonnay but a nice smooth one (I'm not a fan of dry chard).   Great place on Fremont for happy hour.",

It was delicious, but a large portion. It seemed best suited for a party of four. It was only two of us. We ordered the New York strip and skirt steak which were both delicious and perfectly seasoned. Both steaks were cooked perfectly just how we ordered them, medium rare. We didn't order alcohol or dessert. The service was great as well.",

Throughout dinner no staff member said or did anything I recognition of our special day. I'm not saying the service was all that bad it's just when I spend over $220.00 for two people for dinner you expect more or at least we do.  As far as the food goes it was just okay as well, I had the Filet and my wife had oysters and a Caesar salad For me oscars was a \"one time\" thing we won't be back. I wasn't impressed.",

Not approximately 10 min, over 10 min. 3 waiters and 2 bussers attempted to track down \"Justin\" to seat us. He was in the 1/2 full dining room socializing.  The ambiance is nice, authentic Vegas. Overhead windows lend the dining room to expansive views of downtown Vegas and Fremont street.   Cool bar with lots of memorabilia. The food is \"comfort steakhouse\" and is a bit pedestrian. We ordered chopped salad, wedge salad, onion soup, King Crab legs and prime rib. The \"Carolyn\" cut prime rib, left me hungry and disappointed, needing more. The waiter was good, Brad, solid performance, thanks. When we asked to take some of the crab legs to go, the busser brought us a box and bag to \"do it your self\". Hmmm.  I ordered a $230 bottle wine which wasn't deserving of the experience. If you are downtown, try Hugo's Cellar or Vic and Anthony's.",

We have rarely been more disappointed in a meal.  The dinner started out promising with their stunningly amazing meatballs - so simple, but I know how hard it is to get meatballs right and these were amazing.  The evening went down hill quickly with tasteless crab legs, too thick blue cheese dressing, osso buco thay was somehow spicy over limpid polenta.  The bill came and we were charged $30 for a Vieux Carre, and and extra $2 for requesting our bourbon WITHOUT ice.  First time I've ever been charged for NOT wanting something at a bar.  So incredibly disappointed with this meal.",

    "text": "If you didn't know already, this is a restaurant opened by the former mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, hence the name Oscar's.   Located on the 2nd floor of the Plaza hotel, it faces the beginning of the fremont street experience. Upon entry from the MAIN ENTRANCE of the restaurant (not the back elevator or whatever), there are photos of some \"famous people\" who had dined at this restaurant including the current (sigh...) and the former 3 US presidents as well as some others like Celine Dion, etc.  The restaurant has a huge dome like design with glass panels so view is barely hindered by anything. The restaurant is really brightly lit by natural lighting during the day and looks a whole lot better inside than it does outside.   Service was really fast as soon as we were seated. My water cup never went below 50% empty. Our waiter, Bobby, was fairly attentive to us during our visit. There was a little confusing part when we were ordering but was clarified pretty easily. Bobby even apologized for it even though it was not entirely his fault. I asked him for the \"bone in specials\" as directed on the menu, and that had my friend, who was also the birthday boy, change his decision REAL FAST ! lol he originally was dead set on getting the bone in rib eye. The second the waiter had mentioned a special on a 42 oz tomahawk steak, i saw his eyes and smile widen !! Him and his friend opt'ed to get the tomahawk with lobster tail combo. I dont remember the prices exactly but the tomahawk itself was in the $90s. I dont remember how much it was as a combo.   I opted for the bone in rib eye steak ($64). We had saw they offered a \"special\" (not really) of any 3 sides for $22. Why i said not really is because it was printed on the menu. so its not really a \"special\" per se.. But it still saves you money if you intend to get 3 sides. Their sides average $7-9 dollars each, so  if you get all $9 ones, saves u 5 bucks. Other things ordered in the party were the \"Spicy Flame Charred Spoilotro Steak\", \"Sally's New York Strip (Prime)\", \"Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake\" (by recommendation of a couple who were leaving the restaurant while we were waiting), \"Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad), and some sides.   SIDE NOTE - so apparently they give different knives. A larger knife for the males, and a smaller knife for the females... LOL REFER TO PICTURE !   Tomahawk Steak w/ Lobster Tail - to be honest, it didnt look like 42 oz when it came out. Probably more in the 30s. Bone is a little shorter than i've seen for tomahawks. The steak was ordered medium. The center was borderline rare. Cool red center. The birthday boy loved it though. He had no complaints !  Oscar's Bone-In Ribeye ($64) - Not sure the size of the steak but id probably say around 16oz or so. Ordered medium rare, came out a towards medium in the center. The exterior of the steak had a really nice char to it. The cap was really tender. Overall the seasoning was really good. Wished it was slightly less cooked as i had ordered in the eye portion though  Spicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak ($29) - A well seasoned skirt steak, as described ! Infused with garlic, red chili fakes ! The kick it had was actually much more than i had expected from a steakhouse. As my friend and I love eating spice, we were both quite surprised. Seasoned well. Well made skirt steak !   Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake ($19) - this was recommended by a passing couple that just finished their dinner as they were leavin the restaurant and we were standing in front. They highly recommended the crab cake as it was a \"crab ball\" and is one of the best they've ever had. They weren't kidding. Two large balls of a crab cake arrived with some stone ground mustard and a pepper remoulade. The crab was very tender and sweet. Not overpowered by any veggies or seasoning some others may do. The crab was definitely the star ! The ground mustard was subtle and not overpowering as some may be. Paired well with the crab. Preferred the mustard over the pepper remoulade.   Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad - seasonal (red, yellow, orange) tomatoes with burrata cheese, EVOO, and micro greens. (drizzled with a balsamic reduction on top). YUMMY ! apparently burrata is a combination of mozzarella on the outside with 2 other cheeses in the middle creating a soft interior with the \"normal\" mozzarella outside. very clean, simple, but delicious dish !   As for sides, we got the \"Jose Leonardo Roasted Corn Brulee\", \"Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese\" and \"Steak Fries\". The roasted corn was the best of the 3. Fresh chewy corn, not mushy. Was a bit saddened there was a lack of \"brulee\" part. Was hoping to crack through something when i first dug into the side dish. The mac & cheese was most underwhelming. Using gemelli pasta, it was yeah a rich creamy pasta but nothing too special. The steak fries were fried well with a soft, fluffy interior. I'd probably prefer the fries over the mac.   Overall, good experience ! Good place to try in downtown !",

Hey, that's not my problem, your management needs to make things run smoothly even when you're short--the diners should never ever know.  One party ordered a martini and was told he'd have to wait while they washed more martini glasses. Ick. Our other guests said their drinks were pretty darn weak. Table wasn't bused as I would have expected. Utensils not replaced properly. And there's a hostess chick, at least that's what I think she was, that keeps wandering by wanting to make conversation. And just standing there when we're obviously making our own conversation or we'd like to eat while our meal is hot.   I might go back, but might just try one of the gazillion other restaurants in Vegas.",

Ordered a Cesar salad and it was adequate but not great.   One of the \"broads\" came by. Classically dressed from the 60's and she was so boring. I was hoping she'd be fun full of history and witty things but instead it was like talking to a card board box.  Oh well no big deal.  Ordered the prime rib. Medium rare. It was $64 and supposed to be the best in town. It came out well done. Such a shame and waste of a beautiful steak. So I sent it back. It came back raw. I knew better than to send it back a third time so I ate what was cooked and left the giant bloody flesh pot of the middle on my plate.  We vacated as quickly as we could. Oscars may have been great at one time but it seems to be spiraling the drain now.",

Try the Sazerac. I should also mention the view of Fremont Street as well. Anytime anyone wants to do happy hour there, and if you would like some company, feel free to let me know, I should be delighted to join you. Tell the Mayor that the Duke sent you.

Oscars has fun history and a view, and a broad that walks around and visits at your table, very old Vegas which I so love.  The only thing negative I can say was when we were in the bar the one and only cocktail waitress failed to let us know that it was ladies night and women drank for free. I knew that seeing it on the website where I made our reservation that night, so I  was surprised she did not mentioned it to us as she did  so happily to the gals sitting right next to us. ALL LADIES..   My conclusion to that was because I was with a guy and not just women she chose not to let us know, and I felt it was a mistake on her part. Is that upcharging on her behalf ? Im not sure.  There really  should  be no discrimination on ladies night if that was Oscar's offer. We enjoyed our bar time, with some disappointment, but entering the dining room and enjoying the excellent service and view took away from our prior event in the bar.  If your downtown check it out food is wonderful dining room sweet.. Downtown has really become a project that should be saved and its proof that they are working hard to do so.",

If you're feeling like cleaning yourself up a bit and enjoying a very nice atmosphere in a well decorated steakhouse; then you'll do fine with Oscar's.  Only in Vegas could you get away with a sign that says \"Booze, Beef and Broads\"!  I wish I could remember the bartender who served me my dinner.  He was polite, fun to talk to, efficient and professional.  He fit the atmosphere of this classy place perfectly.  I had this one cut of steak that was literally infused with garlic; and lightly seasoned with peppers. I wish I could remember the name of that steak..I'm forgetting everything!   One thing I won't forget is letting you know that you'll have an exciting dining experience if you get to the 2nd floor and stop in at Oscar's.  There's even a piano there; but no one was playing while I was there. Oh...The Caesar Salad wasn't really anything special; and even though it had a hint of anchovies; the dressing bordered on bland.  The mashed potatoes were a bit runny.  I'm sure they intentionally served them that way; but the consistency wasn't really to my liking.  They were flavorful, though.   Even if you miss their Happy Hour; you won't mind spending a bit more for the wonderful service, atmosphere, and great steaks.  I'll probably come here every other time I'm in Vegas...That's because I'm a cheap skate!",

    "text": "I would imagine back in the day this could have easily been one of your 5 star restaurants in Vegas.  However, do yourself a favor and DO go before the end of this era completely has been diminished with all the techno, opulence and glitz Vegas has now become right down to the gin and tonic that has become the redbull and vodka.   It's a shame what this place represents is going fast that if you miss going, you'll miss living an experience you might not be able to find soon.  Even if it's just to check out the memorabilia on the walls near the restroom of what may be (crossing my fingers it hasn't) a by-gone era.  There is a history to Vegas; a vibe and certainly an attitude down to the description on it's website still a place where broads \"will roam the Downtown Las Vegas restaurant as hostesses, adding to the glamorous and uniquely Vegas style of Oscar's.\"  Yes there was certainly an older legendary looking guy who I'm sure has more stories of old Vegas to share with you who roamed the restaurant as a host.   I was waiting to take my picture with him but of course he was only talking with the good looking broad in the restaurant! (Duh!)  And as a thorn in the side reminder of this reality of an era gone by, the amazing Vegas view this restaurant is known for has been somewhat covered up by the stupid zip liner right in front.  Sure the colors of the ceiling look cool if only the zip liner stage could just get out of the way!   And like the attitude I so remember and sometimes miss of Vegas back in the day where you would go for some gambling and a gin and tonic, a smoke and stuff that really does \"stay in Vegas\" my description of the food is well; it's a steakhouse served up by the old legends of what they would consider very good food. The Rib Eye is as big as the serving plate, the potatoes are finger licking scrumptious and the bread has been more buttered up than the woman you came with.

Caesar Salad- Excellent  Filet Minion- Delicious.   There are three reasons I am not giving this 5 stars-   1) The wine selection was way overpriced. $50 for a bottle of Chateau St. Michelle from WA? I don't think so... Simple and common economics shows us that if you reasonably price goods, consumers will purchase more goods overall. We would have purchased the bottle at $37, giving you a $17 dollar profit, but instead we didn't purchase anything because it was overpriced.   2) Again with the wine... No Chianti? Really..? C'mon.   3) The hispanic lady who was bussing our table on 3/4 at 5:30 pm was overly aggressive and bored. She kept interrupting our conversation every five minutes asking if we wanted more water.  NO. For the millionth time!  Then she tried taking our plates before we were finished.  We were trying to enjoy dinner and an nice view.  Just because we weren't shoveling food in our mouth-holes like ravenous beasts, didn't mean we were finished. She wouldn't leave us alone!!! She kept reaching across the table and taking plates off, asking us to hand her things.. \"Hand me that fork please, I cannot reach it.\" How about if you wait until we leave, you can reach all you want!  Jeepers Crymany!   Nice waiter, nice atmosphere, good food.",

I only had to force myself to finish it so I get somewhat of my money's worth but it was hard for me to eat. My boyfriend had the New York rib steak and his was much better than mine, but with the amount of money we spent here, we really didn't get our money's worth. The steaks came no where close to Hell's Kitchen steak we had and it was cheaper too. We also had the calamari and onion rings as sides. The calamari was ok, can't complain about that, but the onion ring was pretty doughy and oily and I didn't want to finish it.",

Seems steep for a whiskey at $20 a glass regular price. Got seated at the hour time and then waited 15 minutes with no server. Caught the attention of a support staff and related this to them. Bradley came over and said he was sorry and that he would serve until they figured out who had the table. Ordered the lobster and crab bisque. Best one i have ever had!! Manager  came over and comped an appetizer which I chose the calamari. It was good but not spectacular. Ordered the Oscar's chopped salad which came topped with onion straws. Good salad but definitely not a meal salad at $11.  Checked in on Yelp and scored a free dessert which is cheesecake. The cheesecake was awesome!! Overall good was very good, ambience very romantic but service and kitchen organization suspect as the table next to me had several issues with wrong steaks being delivered.",

The restaurant is upstairs and not having reservations we sat at the bar but nice table and full service there.   They must hire waitresses based on appearance because all of the waitresses were very attractive.  Crab cakes were very good, lots of crab and no filler. The steaks were excellent.  One warning, the yelp free glass of wine is one per table so break the group up if you want to have more than one.  Prices were normal for a higher end steakhouse but a better value than some high end places in Vegas.  Would recommend.",

The environment has a slight old Vegas feel as it's our old Vegas mayor, Oscar Goodman's place, but it has a modern twist. The setting is downtown Vegas, it's the dome above the valet loop at the Plaza Hitel, and has a view of the downtown side street; I love the feel of the place. The food was great, but it's not the 5 star utterly deliciousness you get at say Cut or Mastro's, but it's a great meal with a positive vibe. The music is a weird choice though, it's like loud pop music. That's the only thing I didn't like, it doesn't match the restaurant vibe.",

Everyone was looking for more menus so when the hostess finally came I reminded her I wanted to be near a window with a good view and she sat us on the side of the restaurant in a dark side of the restaurant with a horrible view even though there were better window tables available. She ran off before I could ask to be moved. Once we said we did not want to order wine to the waiter he immediately started to treat us poorly. We do not drink but we were prepared to spend a lot on food. He ignored us the entire time, we had to items like water or the check from other servers. We watched the waiter ham it up at all his other tables and completely treat us differently. I don't know what we did to be treated so badly.. it was hard to ignore that we did look differently than the other tables there because we were the only people who were not white in the restaurant at the time but I cannot confirm that waiter was racist. It was a horrible anniversary for my parents and a poor closing to our Vegas vacation. The food was bad, the meatballs were old & had to be sent back, the filet was tough, my rib eye was extremely salty. I do not recommend this place to anyone for anything and will not be returning.",

When the crab legs came out, I was extremely disappointed to see the portion amount they had to offer for the price I was paying. I was not too happy. It was a measly two legs that were placed on the dish in front of me.  Another thing I really was not too fond of was the caramelized onions. I thought I was swallowing a spoonful of sugar with every bite I had of the onions. It was too sweet to the standardized caramelized onions that I am so used to.

But it's  a very good restaurant with a really cool room (make sure you sit in the Dome Room or don't even go).  The \"old Vegas\" atmosphere is charming.  The view straight down Fremont Street is great, other than the new Zip line ride blocking the view under construction.  How does a guy who used to be the mayor and is married to the current mayor allow a Zip line to block the view at his own restaurant?  I'm guessing when construction is completed it wont be as obtrusive..........Or else.    The Prime rib was extra tasty.  Burt's hint - Order it one degree under what you would usually order it at.    Mom ordered the Schnitzel and loved it. Also the Caroline cocktail.  Burt's broad ordered the Halibut.  She didn't \"love\" it, but if you ask Burt, what the hell is this broad ordering Halibut for in a steakhouse?    For a side make sure you order the corn.  It was great.  The mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were OK.    Good cappuccino and very good chocolate moose.  NY style cheesecake was good.  Again, NOT the greatest food.

    "text": "Latest update: Kevin B and I have been back to Oscars a couple other times since the initial visits.  I'm growing to love this place...the food, the atmosphere (sans the showgirl) and the service both at the bar and the wait staff.  This establishment will easily earn a fifth star when I have a chance to explore the menu a couple more times.  This last visit I had the wood plank salmon and corn brulee.  Fantastic on both accounts!  The salmon was delicious, fresh and piping hot.  The corn brulee was made with very sweet crisp corn kernels...not sure how, I figured it would be mushy but not even close; my new favorite side dish!  Highly recommended...great happy hour too!",

    "text": "Ok, this review is highly overdue because I have been Coming here for quite some time.  Now the first time I came here was for an early dinner before the show at the Smith Center .  The service was impeccable and the food was great but the broads were well terrible . The next time I came was for a happy hour and I have to say this is one of the prettier bars in Las Vegas definitely worth the trip . Then I started coming here before and after Smith Center event with a dear friend of mine and it seems we made acquaintances with the executive chef.  This is a wonderful place and if you haven't been in the dining room it's in the Plaza Hotel where the pool used to be years and years and years ago. So an interesting location which had a great view prior to the slotzilla being built.  Shall we talk about the food? Yes lets! First of all I went to a wonderful birthday dinner tonight and let me tell you about the barbecue shrimp and crab cakes . Just eat them. They're amazing . The crabcake is exactly what you would want crab a little veg and no filler.  The barbecue shrimp is beyond words. I've had most of the salads the Caesar salad wedge salad and the chopped salad. The chopped salad is my favorite but they're all good.  My friends and I have ordered the Tomahawk twice and it is buttery salty and delicious. Weird way to describe a steak but that's literally what it tastes like.  Although I think tourist would love this spot as much as anyone else I strongly believe the locals should support this place . Go to Oscars!!!!",

All awesomely buttery and creamy. The corn brulee seemed a little under cooked. The creamy horseradish was absolutely perfect not too spicy. The drink menu left something to be desired while it is a full bar it could use some updated interesting drinks for those of us under 65. Service was fast and friendly. There is a \"broad\" that walks around and interacts with the tables. She was very nice and educated is on the restaurant and owner. It was a slightly awkward interaction though.",

    "text": "I took my girl and a friend there for her bd a while back, having heard good things. Great atmosphere and ambience, wasn't overcrowded, excellent service from a personable waiter and the hostess who stopped by to check on us. The view of Fremont experience was awesome, the restaurant was well-insulated from the noise next door. The rub was that I couldn't get past the quality of the food, it didn't correspond to the quality of the rest of the experience. I had a filet mignon which was $50+ and bit into gristle and a fatty chunk on it. What?? That's the whole point of a filet, I can't get my head around how that's even possible. It was sub-par, and I'm being kind by leaving it at that. My gf had a T-bone which also left a lot to be desired. Having moved recently from Chicago, I was really missing places like Gibson's or Morton's, which cost less and are far better. I was honestly resentful about paying the almost $250 bill for 3 people, I feel like I paid a surcharge for being in Vegas and in a place with some history and a story behind it. Needless to say that's my first and last trip to Oscar's. Work on getting the food to match the view and it will be a decent steakhouse.",

    "text": "My husband and I have heard about Oscar's for years and finally decided to give it a try. We went on a Thursday night and it was only moderately busy with patrons. We waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server, he apologized and said that another server would be assisting him. The other server promptly showed up and took our drink order. We then ordered a Blue cheese salad wedge and French onion soup. My husband ordered the special steak of the night- a huge bone in ribeye for $65, I ordered a small cut prime rib and side of mashed potatoes.  His salad wedge arrived but my onion soup did not. After about 10 minutes I got the attention of our server and asked where my soup was. He apparently didn't hear me or remember that I ordered it. It arrived and was your typical onion soup, nothing special. Our steaks arrived and looked beautiful. My husbands ribeye was to die for! He said it was one of the best he's ever had! It was hot, seasoned well and cooked to perfection!  My prime rib was another story; it was luke warm, had little to no taste but it was super tender and not full of fat which I love. Our $9.00 mashed potatoes were not hot enough to melt the butter I added. The thing I hated about this restaurant was the blaring pop music! I love the old school Vegas vibe here but the pop music ruined it for me. It was music you would hear in a dance club. I couldn't wait to leave. I would recommend spending your time and money just down the street at Hugo's Cellar in the basement of the Four Queens. We ate there the night before and have eaten there for over 16 years. It is THE BEST!!",

    "text": "Logistics first - I parked in the Plaza self parking lot just south of the hotel entrance.  You have to pay $5 cash to get in, then you can have the ticket validated and get a refund later from the casino cashier cage.  The walk is a little long, so just use valet parking if you go. The restaurant is lovely and I really did enjoy the view.  There weren't any broads to be seen, but the people watching on Freemont is great. Overall the food was mostly good.  For  starters we had a the chopped salad and the crab cakes.  I love a good salad, but this one was not it.  The avocado was perfectly ripe, but under-seasoned.  Everything was piled together in this very creamy, bland heap.  The salad also had large pieces of fresh herb that became overpowering when you bit into it.  So it was both bland and overpowering.  I know that is a contradiction, but there it is. The crab cakes were delicious with large chunks of crab just barely held together. My NY strip was cooked perfectly with a fabulous crust.  Though I wish I hadn't opted for the au poivre sauce.  We shared a corn brulee side, which was good. The cheesecake was not that good, don't bother. Service was friendly but extremely rushed.  We had our second course arrive while we were still eating our first course.  Then they started clearing dishes while I was still eating my steak.  When he asked to take my plate I told him to give me a few minutes, but I really shouldn't have to if I am holding my silverware and still chewing.  And again they arrived with the bill while we were still on dessert. I had a fun time watching old Vegas at work and the steak was quite good, so as long as you know hat you are getting, you might enjoy.  As long as you eat fast.",

A fantastic view straight down the Fremont Experience entertains during the meal.  I don't eat meat, but our friends said it was excellent.  The seafood choices were wonderful, especially the salmon which melts in the mouth.  Prices are $25 and up for entrees.  Caesar salad for $7 was huge and delicious and they added anchovies for me.  The casino is typical downtown; a bit run down.  But Oscar's is new and elegant and the view is pure Las Vegas neon.  And you don't have to endure walking through a lot of smoke to get there.",

    "text": "***here's the update after dining Sat, 2/19/12***  Skip down if u want pre-dining review.  Our reservations were at 7pm, and of course the 6 of us showed up at 8pm.  Jack, the manager was on location, and he and the host did the best they could to get us seated asap.  The place was bustling, and roughly 30mins later, we were seated by the window overlooking the Fremont experience.  In short, I'm glad I gambled on Jack instead of taking the easy way out with so many other choices in vegas.  I would and will dine at Oscar's again.    The bread and butter came out quickly, and it was delicious.  It was like a onion loaf, perfectly crisp on the outside and moist and chewy in the center.  I do my best to avoid carbs at night, but there was no avoiding the 3-4 rounds for the table.  All of us were still raving about it the next morning.       A buddy got the prime rib, and sampling it made us regret we ordered anything else.  I'm a big Lawry's fan, but it blew it out of the water.  My filet wasn't bad either, but it was like dating a victoria secret model from a pool of sports illustrated models.  Everyone enjoyed their entree.  Service was attentive and our server really hustled for us.  We were drinking and being rambunctious, and he managed us without a hitch.  We got water and drinks when we wanted them.  No dessert, as we needed to rush out of there for the club.  The 'Broads' is a novel idea, and under different circumstances, it might have added to the experience.  Good logistics and 'knowing your audience' because they didn't bug us at all.       ***pre-dining review*** Firstly, haven't dined, but have resv in a couple weeks, so will update my rating after actual experience.  My current rating was a judgement call purely based on my conversation with the manager on duty, Jack, about their Yelp reviews.  Friends and I are big Yelpers; we read the good, bad, and some inbetween.  We try to avoid anything 4 star below.  However, we also love trying new places, and moreover, i love dt vegas and having Oscar Goodman's name on the door gave it novel appeal.  Yes, he may personally overcook a steak like any other god fearing consigliere, but sure \"he can make an offer you can't refuse\" to pull in the right people.  Short of it is, I called because I wanted to get his take on the negative reviews and offer assurances that they got rid of the gremlins and have grown out of new restaurant pains.  Conversation could have gone two ways.  First, his reply would could have been defensive and dismissive considering Oscar Goodmans name recognition, and the fact he has a captive audience being the Plaza Hotel's fine steakhouse.  That response would have made me more leery, and we would have gone to an established 4 star.  It didn't.  Instead, Jack, the manager, took the True owner/operator approach, owned up to past mistakes, and was very earnst about the fact they defintely went through some new reataurant pains, but they've since righted the ship.  He didn't make any exuses, and offered his word and his handshake through the phone.  That gave me the confidence to keep my reservation, so I'm looking forward to the actual experience.  Stay tuned...",

Anyway, I ordered the strip steak and my girlfriend ordered some kind of mozzerella or other.  The skirt steak was cooked really good.  Little bits of garlic was cooked into the steak and it was uber tender.  The mozzarella was ok.  Fresh.  The bread and butter on the table was amazing.  The butter was where the expression \"like butter\" came from.  It was so smooth and warm.  My goodness. Yum.  The reason I give this place 3 stars instead of 5 is because even though the food is splendid, the price isnt.  A steak is a minimum of 40-something dollars.   What the heck.  Am i made of money?

Then it went all down hill from there! It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and my husband went to the bar himself to get our drinks after that. I was served two totally different colored and tasting apple martinis, one the waiter brought, and the other my husband ordered. The bread basket came cold and without butter. The soup was luke warm, and even thought we ordered our steaks medium well, they were so red, they could have moved off our plates!  I spoke with the manager on duty, I believe his name was Adam, he brought me out a new drink, and said he was comping the other one. But my husband already went to the bar to get our drinks, and he never came back with my 2nd drink.  We were still charged for the drink, and never got the 2nd one which we already paid for. By the end of the night, my husband didn't feel like talking to anyone anymore, so we just paid our $147.00 bill and left. We also paid for spinach we never received. This is definately an anniversary we will never forget!  I was looking forward to going here, and I am embarassed for our former Mayor who put his name on this restaurant.....this place will never make it! Should have gone to Texas de Brazil...where our original plans were made!",

    "text": "I guess I should have read the other reviews before going? We made dinner reservations for Christmas. I called before 5 PM and left a message as directed by the voicemail with my name, number, date and time of the reservation, how many and contact number. They open at 5PM so I expected a call back by 5:30 PM, Not! I called back at 6:15PM and after the language barrier of the person who took my reservation I was set. We arrived at 4:40 PM for a 5:00 Reservation and were directed to the bar to wait unit we could be seated. Drinks were well made but a little pricey even by most restaurant standards. We were seated a little after 5 and we found the decor and table arrangements pleasing. If you do go ask for a table overlooking Freemont Street. Our Waitress was pleasant and friendly when she came over and offered up the wine list, which we declined. We ordered several appetizer's and the Ceaser Salad. While we waited we ordered Iced tea and water and that was delivered in a reasonable time. The Crab Cakes were good as was the Tomato and Mozzarella platter. The Salad was drenched in dressing and I was unable to eat it and sent it back. The Waitress claims she spoke to the Manager and took it off the check (I will cover that later). After the appetizers we were served a cold bread basket and no butter. After about 5 minutes the Bus Person came back with the butter and reaching over my Mothers head dropped it in the middle of the table. As one of the other reviews said the bread was cold and the butter was actually bland with no taste. Our Waitress came over to let us know she was going to place our meal orders and it would be about 15 minutes or so. That's fine we were in no hurry. During this time we had to ask for water refills and Iced Tea. It seems that everyone just walked around but paid no attention to the tables? While we were sitting there the Bus Person reached over and took my Wife's bread plate off the table for no apparent reason. My wife had a dirty knife from the Tomato Salad and when she tried to give it to her she told her to keep it and reuse it. During our wait one of the Hostesses making the rounds stopped by our table and my wife mentioned this to her. She brought a new plate and knife for her. After that our table was ignored by the Managers who walked around and the Hostess, though they did visit one or two tables for long periods of time (I guess High Rollers). Our waitress checked back and told us a 5-7 minutes for our dinner. We waited 12 but Good Food takes time. If this was good food I would have not minded. My 6 oz Steak was perfect inside (medium rare) but had no taste to it at all. My wife's Prime Rib was dry and there was no offer of any Au jus Sauce to moisten it up. My Mothers Salmon was over done and burnt on the outside. The side dishes were ok, nothing special just ok. None of us finished our dinners and we did not request to pack them up. (These are signs good Managers look at when their customers are still at their tables). We declined dessert for obvious reasons an our Waitress gave us the option of her returning with our check or did we want to wait 5 or 10 minutes. I asked for it right away so I did not have to sit their and think about the experience. She disappeared and after about 6 or 7 minutes came back and dropped of a final check with no listing of what we had so I could not tell if the Salad had been removed. Had she come back or someone else was close I would have asked for an itemized bill. They also did not ask for ID on my Credit Card which is not signed on the back for that reason. For a small place with so many Servers Bus Persons, etc the attention to detail is minimal. Everyone runs around but it seems nothing gets done. We had high hopes for this to be a return to destination with friends and family but that is not going to happen. If you go delight at the venue and the view of Freemont Street, maybe get an appetizer or two and leave.",

    "text": "Went last Friday night.  After being sat, our server failed to come for 15 minutes, (I timed it with my watch.)  After telling us the specials, our server left without offering us a drink.  When our server returned, he took our food order, took my wife's drink order and left.  I called him back to order a drink and he gave me attitude.  When he returned, he brought the wrong wine for my wife, and told me the drink I ordered was sold out.  After the food came, it took our server another 20 minutes to check on us.  I had the Spiolotro steak medium, and it tasted like a piece of fat that was burned on the outside after basted with olive oil.  Our server forgot my wife's side dish of asparagus until the meal was almost finished.  When the bill came, the server failed to change the drink to the one I actually received, which changed the price of the check.    We have eaten at almost every steakhouse on the strip, and this was probably the worst experience out of all of them.",

It's at the Plaza, which is not even remotely attractive, but the valet is right off Main and it's easy to get to the restaurant. When you go up the escalators and enter Oscar's it's like walking into a totally different place from the old carpet and smoke that you get down on the casino floor. The bar staff is friendly, the food was delicious, and the price is wallet-friendly by Las Vegas steak place standards. And tons of Vegas kitsch (there was a DeNiro impersonator that night) which is the whole reason to even bother with downtown. I can honestly say that I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again. I might even bring out of town guests here - but only if they have a good sense of humor.",

He made sure that our drinks were always full and that we were satisfied with our meal every step of the way. My boyfriend had the Spilotro-Style skirt steak and I had Carolyn's Cut Prime Rib. We both thoroughly enjoyed the steak and each had more than enough! Then we indulged in the tiramisu, which was great. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. As locals we will definitely be back and recommend it to our friends. The only disappointment was that Mayor Goodman didn't show up while we were there ;)",

Mom started with the Calamari which was lightly battered and deep fried.  This was one of the largest single portions of Calamari, I have ever seen.  Dad had the Large Fillet, while Mom and I each had the New York Strip.  Dad and I also got the vegetables as well.  EVERYTHING was juicy, tasty and delicious.  The place was a little bit noisier than I had anticipated, but the room was laid out beautifully and had a very comfortable feel.  I did not use the bar, but again, it looked beautiful.  The walls were covered with great photos and really do tell a tale of thos historic landmark all by themselves.  If you are looking for an Upscale, Old Vegas Experience... Oscar's is a must!",

    "text": "My wife and I made reservations well in advance to this place after reading the other reviews here. Keep in mind this is our late Valentine's dinner date.   Valet parking was a little bit confusing since we pulled up and there was no valet guy...or girl...present. Since I was waiting and causing a little traffic in the small driveway just outside the restaurant, a security guard told me to go around again. When I went around again, I saw the valet guy show up and he was chillin' at his booth. WTH?! We had to flag him down and tell him that we're eating at the restaurant. We got out, got our valet ticket and he parking our car at the front of the hotel.  We walked into the hotel to go upstairs to the restaurant. The hostess was able to sit us immediately. Here is when it really went south. Our assigned waiter to our table was nowhere to be found after 10 minutes looking at the menu. We haven't even placed our drink orders in yet. My wife wanted to walk out. I had to flag down another waiter who was taking care of another table and ask how come we weren't served yet. He at least took over drink orders. He came back with our drinks and told us the waiter that is assigned to our table was no where to be found. Thumbs down! I was so nice and HANGRY that I told my wife that let's give this place a try. The waiter who I flagged down volunteered to be our waiter for the night.  Our volunteer waiter was 'okay' since he had to take care of an additional table and the tables he was assigned to take care of. It took him a little longer for him to take care of each table which is understandable.   As for the for the whiskey cocktail I ordered that had an orange juice taste to it was good. I forgot what it was called. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon which is good as I would expect it to be. As for the food, we split a rib-eye and shared a side of corn and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked the way we wanted it...medium. The corn and mashed potatoes were cooked well and not dry. In short, the food was great compared to the lack of a waiter.  We didn't bother for dessert. My wife was not happy at the end of the night even though the food was great. She wanted to get out of there so fast, I paid cash and we did not bother to ask for change. We are definitely not coming back here again even if I get messaged that our next visit would be on the house.",

My friends and I checked in on Yelp for the free glass of wine! We were told it's one glass per table however the check in said one glass with an entree. We didn't argue with them and accepted the one glass of wine but considering it house wine that you are pouring how much profit did you lose by denying us two more glasses?   The service was immaculate but I thought my prime ribs was too salty. By the way we spent over $200 and probably will not come back over the glasses of wine.",

Oscar Goodman used to be a mob attorney and then went on to become the Mayor of Vegas.  Like his interesting past history, his restaurant carries an old school seductive flare from its decor to menu items.  This place in my opinion is better than Ruth Chris or Flemings.  The dishes are simple but quality is where Oscar excels.  I got the NY strip and man it was juicy and pieces were easy to cut like butter.  Anthony Bourdain recommended getting their wedge salad and after trying it I agree with that advice.  If you want impress someone and give them a taste of Vegas, go to Oscars.

    "text": "On June 19, my husband made on-line dinner reservations for us for my birthday through Open Table, advertising Las Vegas Restaurant Week - Three Square, 6/17- 6/28 at Oscar's Steakhouse at the Plaza Hotel for $40.00 Dinner.  In addition, making note of my birthday in the \"Special Remarks Section.\"  Once there, we made mention to the person seating us that we were there for my birthday.  We didn't think we needed to reiterate it again to our waiter, by now he should have known.  Once seated, we noticed the ambiance was minimal.  There were no views since the zip-line tower and stage was now front and center of the restaurant blocking all views of Fremont St., the construction of a new casino was underway, and the decor lacked a sense of style and elegance.   Upon ordering, we noticed the menu showed the price at $50.00 for the pre-set dinner special which included a beet salad, steak & asparagus or scallops w/risotto as the entree, and cheesecake for dessert.  We asked the waiter about the $40.00 advertised special, which he knew nothing about, and we proceeded to show him on our cell phone the advertised price.  He brought it to the Manager's (Mike)attention; however, the waiter returned only to tell us that the price was $50.00. Later that evening, it was brought to our attention, by the Host, that the Manager had contacted the on-line company informing them of the error and that the price would be corrected the next day.  Nonetheless, the restaurant  never honored the $40.00 price advertised and charged us the $50.00 menu price.  The scallops I ordered were wonderful.  However, the risotto was undercooked and inedible.  Our waiter never came by to ask us how our meal was and left the rest of our service to the busboy.  It became evident that our waiter had no idea we were celebrating a birthday when he brought over our dessert and no \"Happy Birthday\" written anywhere, nor any acknowledgment of my birthday.  I then informed our waiter of my birthday, and he was surprised of the news. He then proceeded to inform us that the birthday dessert was cheesecake and he would bring us yet another one, since the ones we were served came with our dinner special.  We now had 3 cheesecakes.    Our waiter came back a few minutes later informing us that he had spoken to the Manager, and the only thing he would do was offer us yet another dessert for their mistake.  We declined his offer, since we didn't need a fourth dessert.  What would have been more appropriate was for the manager to take the time and personally apologize for their mistake and offer something else as a good faith gesture.  Instead, the attitude was \"Oh well, Too bad!\"   That seemed to be the theme of the evening for us.",

I am not sure how the stench of expired oysters made it past the cook and server but if you have never smelled an expired oyster, I promise you, you will never forget the smell.  In addition to, we had to ask for bread, our $90 steak was over cooked as well as the salmon. We dropped over 1k and I just expected way more for this price point. Needless to say I was embarrassed that I chose this restaurant for such a special occasion. At least they had a good bar.",

I think you can get a much less expensive prime rib somewhere else nearby, but you are partially paying for the experience. Prime rib was excellent! It comes A la carte though, which I found odd. Doesn't waste your money on the $9 baked potato, which probably cost them $1 to make haha. Get a more original side dish. Neat that they have a deal on Yelp where you can get a free glass of wine! We took advantage of that! I would recommend trying it out!",

He told us all the specials, checked in on us promptly, was attentive but not in the annoying way waiters like to be. He gave us a brief history lesson on the restaurant and hotel He also recommendations of the city.   The restaurant over looks Fremont street so request to be by a window of possible!   I highly recommend!  Hot tip: get one the food cards on the strip. We went to tix for tonight near the M&M store. It's $5 a person and you get 30% off the meal for all parties. Saved us $40!",

Definitely not If you're staying on the strip...  Just getting an uber or the bus to get there and back takes over an hour of your time.   The restaurant in itself is not huge the hostess was not very professional never spoke to us just seated us and left.   Our waitress we did enjoy she had been there several years very dry personality that we got and enjoyed thankfully - I can see it going different for some people though.  We ordered the crab cakes - the crab cakes were the best out of the entire meal I promise you. There is a reason people rave about these on numerous reviews. Never have I ever had a more fresh crab cake! Their bread was the next best thing of our entire meal including the steaks. Their bread was fresh and had onions baked into it. Very different and very delicious. I'm shocked we didn't ask for a second loaf! Their serving/helping of everything is very generous!   Also, we dressed up in a dress and my husbands wore khakis - don't feel like you have to in this place we were the most overdressed in the entire dining room. People were wearing jeans and baseball caps. The entire dining room itself overlooks freemont street so really no view is a bad view.   My husband really enjoyed the asparagus I thought it was so so. The mac and cheese definitely was mediocre. The filets weren't near tasty as I have back in Oklahoma. No seasoning it seemed like.  When we walked out we felt as If we wasted our evening coming all the way to freemont for this deal. I would have rather spend the extra $50 or so bucks for a better seasoned steak and better quality food. Also would have saved the $30 in ubers there and back. Just not worth it.",

The food was good. It wasn't the best steakhouse food I've ever had in my life but it wasn't bad either.  We didn't have any problems with the cook on the steak or the sides being cold or anything.  I do think it's a bit overpriced but I don't really expect less in Las Vegas at a place like this.    Overall, it was a great experience that I would definitely be interested in having again.",

Oscar's is very much an intentional throwback, but without feeling like you have walked into 1980 (which isn't a bad thing; see my review on Hugo's Cellar). If you go here, you can expect to have a really decent steak cooked as well as a steak has any right to be cooked, and their waiters, replete with facts and information about old Vegas which was very much the influence on this restaurant, e.g. the 'Spilotro' Steak.  The Menu for the most part is a la carte, but there are a few entrees that come with a side. The fair is predictably expensive, which for me is usually hard to justify, but with the right atmosphere, which they provide, and good company (you have to supply that on your own), it's justifiable.  I have had the chance to try the non-steak options like the chicken, beef short ribs and the salmon, and it's all very very good as well. I asked the waiter, Bobby Ghio, if I should get the whole sea bass or the roasted salmon, and he suggested the salmon, so I got it. No joke, that was the best salmon I have ever eaten. There was a perfectly seared crust, perfectly seasoned, cooked just to the point of it being done, but not overly so (which is a frequent problem with fish I have gad prepared elsewhere), and hot when came out. So good.   I know it's a steak house, and if you go there, you should get a good steak, but I'll remember that salmon for a long time.  The restaurant also has a classy looking bar, and the seating for the main restaurant which is in the round has a view don't Fremont Street. It's only a shame that they have the tower for the zip liners in the way of a proper view of Downtown, but it's still nice.   So, bottom line is, if your flush, or if you've hit it big at a craps table, give it a shot, but this place is not friendly for the budget-inclined.",

We were able to gaze out the window at how different everything looked compared to the main Las Vegas Strip.  The decor was definitely old school-- it felt like I went back into time to the 80's.   We came here for Prime Rib.  We all went with the Bone-in PRIME RIB Special, and we were not disappointed.  The prime rib is HUGE!  I shared this with one of my girl friends and we couldn't even finish.  The meat was super tender, juicy, and the crust was nicely seasoned (I love this part of the meat!).  There was just the right amount of au jus on the prime rib, and was served with a creamy horseradish sauce.  For the size and quality, I'd say this is a great deal!  We shared a few sides as well: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Creamed Spinach, and Sweet Potato with a Jalapeno Butter sauce.  My favorite side was the lobster mashed potatoes, but I wish there were bigger chunks of lobster in it in stead of shredded pieces.  The creamed spinach was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The sweet potatoes weren't very tasty.. it's pretty much 3 gigantic sweet potato fries, served with some sweet/watery sauce.  It did not taste like buttery nor jalapeno-- I wouldn't recommend this side.   If you ever visit old town Vegas, be sure to stop by Oscars for some Prime Rib!",

We had heard good things, Yelp had good reviews, so we gave it a shot.  I ordered the pepper and garlic infused steak, the waitress explained that this rough cut of meat becomes very tender due to the time it's marinated.  While the flavor was good, the meat was TOUGH.  I ate about 20% of my steak and the rest went to waste.  My husband, who will pretty much eat anything, said my steak was awful.  My husband said his order of steak was good, but needed additional salt.  Our sides: potatoes and asparagus.  The potatoes... OMG, SO GOOD!  The asparagus was awful... it was woody, oversized, and tough.  For the amount we paid, I was pretty disappointed by the time we walked out of there.  Our waitress was slammed busy, so didn't really allow me the time to bring up my concerns, so I left... I ended up \"needing\" an order of fries from the hot dog place at The D later that night.  ;)  Most disappointing of all... I called the next day to let a manager know of my disappointment with my steak and asparagus, and the fact that I paid all that money for stuff that went to waste.

    "text": "Excellent! In every aspect.  The service, the setting, and the food.  I had made reservations to dine here after the show that was at The Smiths Center and although we arrived  here 15 minutes later than the reservation the hostess who seated us and our server and the guys at the bar were all very hospitable and welcoming.   I didn't even have a clue they were closed when we arrived.  Only when I asked what the hours were was when our server told us they closed at 10pm right when we had arrived.  He said not to worry he already had let the chef know that he had seated us and another party who also came from the show.     After hearing what the specials were for the evening I decided on Surf and Turf...Lobster and Filet Mignon. I totally forgot to find out the cost(sorry!)  I know the prices for entrees on the menu were in line with other steakhouses in the area. Our bill came to under 15o bucks so pretty much average for 2 steak, sides, desserts and drinks.     Now this is steak! High quality, grass fed. Light char and  when sliced it was like butta and flavorful! Ordering it med rare is the way to go.  No wonder it's #5 in top steakhouses on the strip.  I told Mr. B. this steak so far tops the other steakhouse we dined at last month. The lobster..was a good sized portion too. Either I was super hungry or my meal was so good because I cleaned up my plate. (and those of you who know me know that's very rare!)   The ambiance has a throwback feel of the old Vegas era. The servers have pin striped vest with white ties ala mob inspired. The restaurant is located the dome area of the revamped Plaza Hotel so it has an open airy feel to it. Colors of white and silver, and the trio of huge crystal chandeliers gives it a touch of elegance. This sets the tone for dressy casual wear.  I'd leave the shorts and tanks in your hotel room, but the vibe is casual and friendly enough where you wont feel like an outcast if you are under dressed.  The added bonus of this restaurant are the views from your table or booth. You can catch the Fremont Street Experience light show from this restaurant.    Service as mentioned was excellent. Our server Ray was pretty easy going.  In fact us, our server and the table across from us were all conversing about the Burt Bacharach show we saw. I told him I'm making it a point to make sure I'm seated in his area next time I book a reservation.  The runners kept our table cleaned, crumbed our table and kept our drinks filled. Oscar's \"Broad\" Vanna made the rounds and came to our table in her showgirl outfit.  For the sake that someone looking up this review wondering who is Oscar...It's your Hizzoner! Former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman and yes this is his restaurant.  ..and yes this is the where they filmed some scenes from the move \"Casino\" where he played himself the mob lawyer! ..it's not why we wanted to dine here but real happy we did. Will be back again since we will  be seeing alot of shows over at the Smiths Center.",

And, don't tell *everyone* but the $29 'Spilotro' steak is enough for 2 persons - it's an incredibly delicious and generous portion of skirt steak stuffed with whole garlic cloves (!) AND it comes with a portion of mashed potatoes, too.   Pretty awesome jumbo lump Crab Cakes (two big ones for $17) - the waiter actually declared a 'money-back guarantee' if I didn't like them. I didn't have to take him up on it because they were as good as crab cakes get.  The environment is very vintage Vegas - as you'd imagine it to be, with a mid-century modernesque atrium where every seat has a commanding view of the Fremont Street Experience. We were there on a Sunday night when the restaurant was sans their signature 'broads' which was fine by me. I can't imagine that a kitschy team of flirty girls would make the average diners' meal any better than it already is.  Quite underrated establishment, if you ask me. I enjoyed this *way* more than The Golden Steer, and The Steak House at Circus Circus...",

Off Fremont street made us even more worried. We wanted something memorable and classy.   Turns out my touristy fears were unfounded. Oscars was amazing. The restaurant was very well done and we sat over looking Fremont street but couldn't hear any of the obnoxious noise.   The last time we were in Vegas we went to Ruth's Chris and loved it. Oscars was better. We shared a HUGE rib eye. It was perfect no too fatty, just perfect. Did I mention it was perfect.   We had the smashed potatoes and brussels sprouts for our sides. Very tasty.   Our waiter Bobby was attentive and polite and quite funny. The Manager Jeff came by twice to make sure we were having a good time and even Oscar's assistant stopped by, \"because Oscar wanted to make sure we were being taken care of\"  it was a nice touch.   We felt like the whole staff really cared about our experience. It was awesome. I plan to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

We had a really nice time here but I think its very overpriced considering the location. Started with decent cocktails....should be for $17 each(Manhattan/Old Fashioned). Wife had a glass of pinot. My son really liked his corn and crab bisque....wife and I split a Caesar salad..good not great. I had the NY Strip($48)..it was very good. Wife had the blackened Salmon..she said it was tender and tasty. My son had the bone in ribeye($64!). ordered it medium..looked medium rare to me but he loved it. mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were typical but good. You should try the deep dish Chocolate Chip Cookie for dessert. Insanely good and enough for three. We liked our server named Scott. personable..efficient.. just what you'd expect at a high end place like this. we were very impressed with their free valet service too/fro the Smith Center.

    "text": "Oscar's is another example of \"you get what you pay for\".  My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the Plaza, with Oscar's as our dinner plan.  The evening started in the bar with Martinis before dinner.  Rather than sitting at the bar itself, we chose two very comfortable padded leather chairs at a small table and settled in to enjoy the ambiance.  If these weren't the best dirty Gin Martinis we've had, they were too close to split hairs over.  Our waiter was very courteous, ensured we knew it was Happy Hour, and had several recommendations for us in the event wanted to try something other than the Martinis.  Not long after we sat down, one of Oscar's \"Broads\" introduced herself and made sure we knew to call on her if we needed anything.  We were told our table was ready slightly before our reservation time, and the hostess was quick to tell us we could finish enjoying our drinks at the bar or bring them to the table, which ever we preferred.  Our waiter was ready with the bill in case we wanted to move right away.  We paid and moved to our table.  We sat along the outer edge of the restaurant and had a wonderful view of the intersection of Main and Fremont Streets.  The restaurant is even with the second floor and sits in front of the Plaza Hotel and Casino.  Surrounded by glass with a raised center section, it looks like there isn't really a bad seat in the house.  We were happy to see that the man who was our waiter at the bar had moved into the restaurant and was now our waiter for dinner as well.  He was fantastic and represented the \"Old Vegas\" class and courtesy that is so much a part of our city's reputation.  He treated us like royalty and ensured we knew that we could order another round of Martinis (or other drinks) at Happy Hour prices.  (We did, of course.)  We ordered Shrimp Cocktail to start the meal and Filet Mignon (Oscar style) for dinner, with smashed potatoes and creamed spinach as sides.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  The portions weren't excessive, but there was enough food that we could have taken leftovers home.  Our waiter ensured our glasses were never empty, was never pushy, didn't rush us at all and even took time to talk with us after dinner.  As we ate we saw the Broad move casually through the restaurant several times, ensuring any and all questions were answered, and sitting with guests for conversation when asked.  When we were done with our meals, our waiter had our check ready.  It was a pleasure to tip generously for truly superior service.  We can't wait to head back to Oscar's.  There are many more things on the menu we'd like to try and we're excited to experience the equally amazing service again and again.  If you live in Vegas and haven't gone to Oscar's yet, find the time and go.  If you're visiting and want a special evening to enjoy some Old Vegas hospitality right where it all began down on the original Las Vegas Strip, be sure to save a night and go.  You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Hmmmm, a lot of Orangehead glowing reviews. Seems a bit suspicious to me.  I was at Oscar's earlier in the week and did not have the phenomenal experience as some of these alleged Yelp rookies. As a fan of old school Vegas, I was very excited when a Vegas native recommended this to me. \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\" sounds like something Dean, Sammy and Frank would frequent so I was excited. Overall, Oscar's left me grouchy despite the fantastic view of Sesame, I mean Fremont St.  First off, let's get the location out of the way. The wall of windows provides and exciting or romantic atmosphere, depending on your purpose. Unfortunately, a half empty dining room on a weeknight does not inspire the staff to seat you unless you decide to pony up for the companionship of a \"broad\"  So let's discuss this elephant in the room. They have \"broads\" who roam the room looking to spark conversations with customers. OK, I am cool with that. You're supposed to buy them a drink. Uhhh, OK! And then dinner....and then tip them? An acquaintance bought into the ploy (although in fairness, the girl did not push that hard). Her glasses of wine and entree tacked on $50 to the bill and then we had to tip. We were celebrating and not afraid to drop some cash but it seems that the restaurant should have done a better job of explaining the concept. As it was our reunion of buds was continually interrupted by these broads.  The service was slow but engaging. several of us were put off by the fact that their cuts of meat were \"choice\" but charged \"prime\" prices. The consensus was that they were OK but not worthy of the price. The sides were uninspiring.   Oscar's is new so maybe it will improve. Also, being from Dallas, we do steakhouses like nobody's business so perhaps my standards are high. For a cheaper prices at Nick & Sam's or Pappas' I can get a steak that will put Oscar's to shame and some adult mac n' cheese with lobster that will make me swoon. Go, enjoy Oscar's view, and beware. Feel free to chat up the broad but know what you are getting into.",

    "text": "Mixed.  The place is owned by former mayor of Las Vegas Oscar Goodman.  He became the mayor after serving as a defense attorney for the mob for 30 years in Las Vegas.  Thus, a lot of history in this place.    Pros:  The New York Steak was outstanding.  Perfectly cooked and the insides cooked to the right temperature.  The salmon was good as well.  Had seasoned potato wedges, and they were a good accompaniment to the steak.  Creme Brulee and Chocolate Lava Cake were outstanding.  Extensive wine lists of moderate to expensive wines.  Also, the ambience was great.  The piano man playing in the background, the showgirls walking around on the floor talking to patrons, and the walls of photos of Oscar Goodman with politicos, celebrities, etc... were great.    Cons:  Open since Dec 11. Still growing pains./  My wife ordered onions with her seafood, and it did not come with the meal.  The waiter had to be reminded and it finally arrived AFTER she had finished her meal.  It was taken away and an apology from the waiter.  There should have been more consideration considering the costs paid for the meal.  Beer, all bottled and none on tap.    So, if you like steak, this is the place.  Depending on he time of day, expect a long wait.  And do not be surprised if they get the meal wrong.  But, when that steak arrives, you should be very pleased.  For two people with a main course, 1 soup, two side dish accompaniments, two desserts, one soda and one cocktail, expect to drop $130 plus.  A Bottle of wine would have added $50.00 to the total minimum.",

    "text": "Made reservations on-line and requested a booth. We were sat near the stairs, upper dinning with no view, no booth. Reviewing the wine list, not extensive and over priced we decided to order by the glass. Nice pour by any standards so that receives a few stars. We ordered Caesar salad to start. Big salads with decent flavor and at a good price. For the main dish my wife had the chicken and I had the Big Chris Steak. The chicken was good and my wife seemed to enjoy. The steak was not good. The New York had a gamey taste and smell with a texture and taste of venison. We told our waiter and he reported back to the manager. The manager argued that it was the wet aging process and that there was nothing wrong with the steak. Not asking for any compensation he did take the steak off the bill. After this encounter we were presented with the bill, no ask of coffee or desert. When I asked about why this was overlooked the waiter indicated that we told the manager we were done. The waiter apologized and then asked if we would like coffee or desert. We indicated no thank you! I did tip the waiter over 20% and this is on the total of if the steak was on the bill.  Observation: They are getting going but it seems that this place lacks experience. The \"broads\" gimmick does not seem to work and just seems to annoy the customers. Competition is big for upscale steakhouses in Vegas. If they don't make changes they will not make it. We will not be back.",

The hostesses were super nice even though my friend and I were fairly confused as to where exactly the restaurant was. We were the only people in that portion of the restaurant (it was about 9:15 and they close at 10). The servers were friendly, quick, and very helpful. We had a couple of salads and pastas. The onion bread was nice and hot, the salads were fresh, and the pastas were delicious. The prices were also pretty reasonable. That said, the staff in Simpatico were also circulating through Oscar's. Our experience was absolutely wonderful and while I can't comment too much on the steakhouse portion; if you're here and want a good meal, Simpatico was really nice and the prices are better.",

The bar tenders were great, made excellent cocktails and had very nice personalities. This is an upscale restaurant and to not have a cocktail server underplays the classy vibe. The fact that there were 2 hostesses for what appeared to be an empty dining room, standing at the podium chatting with one another, seemed like a bit of wasted resources when the bar had about 15 people and very busy bar tenders who never stopped working. It was a Tuesday and it was not super crowded but we did have to leave our lounge area seating to go to the bar to place our order. We carried our own cocktails back to our seating area but our food was delivered.  Like I mentioned before the crab cakes were amazing. The calamari was crispy and full of flavor (the sauce for the calamari not anything to rave about) the ahi was wonderful served with delicious pickles. Will I go back? You bet! I am Looking forward to those crab cakes!",

The waiters seemed to have a little attitude. We waited 20 min before getting our drink order in and even then it was only cause we stopped the host to ask if we can order. We got asked about our meal when we were already done and had to ask twice for drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when we are a light hearted group. The food was average. I got the tuna appetizer and it wasn't popping with flavor like ahi should be. The calamari the rest of the table got was like you can get anywhere, nothing special. For my main dish I got the crab stuffed shrimp, good not great. I like crab and shrimp so enjoyed but again the sauce and food wasn't popping with any flavor. The asparagus I could make at home. The sweet potato wedges were good but must have been a white sweet potato so not what I imagined and not sure I would have ordered. I don't tend to eat white potatoes. Lastly they brought cheesecake for the birthday, we aren't much into cheesecake but I'm told it was good. Now I love cobbler and have had some good ones based on my travels but their apple cobbler was bland to me. I don't know if it's the apples used or again the spices missing.  I can say I have been there but doubt I would go again.",

    "text": "I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  After eating at Oscar's Steakhouse on Wednesday I can say I'm still looking!   I'll start with the service.   We arrived just before 6pm and were quickly seated in the main room with an amazing view. We were in a booth that sat a little higher then the tables so it really made us feel special. However, looking back I can't imagine being sat anywhere else because...we were the only people there. In other words the entire restaurant was ours! Before my bottom was on my seat our waiter (Frank) and his helper (David) were right at our service asking if it was our first time at Oscar's. As we tried to remove our jackets and find a comfortable position in the booth Frank kept charging on with the history of the restaurant and his long and distinguished service career as a waiter. As my arm was coming out of my jacket I found David waving the menu in my face for me to look at. Two seconds later Frank was ready to take our order. After stepping over Franks conversation about him working during the Johnson administration, I found my self raising my voice to notify him that we would like to look over the menu first for a while. Once he finally left the table we couldn't help but laugh about the amount of excitement we must have brought to the place. It was like we were the only people to eat there in days. Franks willingness to drop by our table and \"chat\" about his many travels as a waiter never seemed to tire. As it stands Frank has to go down as the kindest, pushiest waiter I've ever had. I took the time to put our most memorable interactions with him below.   1. Frank \"You ready to order\". My girlfriend  \"Just a few more moments please\" Frank \"Well you have to order now because I'm going to get busy soon\" My girlfriend \"Oh\" 2. Frank \"What would you like miss\"? My girlfriend  \"I'll take the flank steak\" Frank \"You sure\"? My girlfriend  \"Yes\" Frank  \"Do you know what a flank steak is\"? My girlfriend  \"Yes\" Frank \"So you know it's chewy\" My girlfriend \"Chewy\"? Frank \"Ya Chewy and hard to eat\" My girlfriend  \"That's not a good way to describe a steak\" Frank \"Well it's the truth\"  Now for the food After being forced into it my girlfriend got the filet mignon ($32) and I tried the veal ($40). We also decided to get a side of asparagus($9) and another well poured martini ($17). Once at the table it became apparent that the kitchen was also in an unnecessary hurry. Because the presentation was terrible. Her steak was alone on the plate and my veal was just the opposite, it was  pouring over the plate! On top of my extra large portion was a pound of greens that sloppily covered the breaded veal. As I fished down the forest of greens to cut a bite I got lost and ended up cutting a bite of fat. Once in my mouth I quickly noticed that it wasn't meat so I spit it out on the plate. Then I took another bite....it tasted exactly the same as the first!! It seems that the breading was so thick that all you could taste was the grease that it was cooked in. Needless to say, I could cook veal better myself, My girlfriends steak was small but good. However, she can definitely cook a better steak at home as well. Nothing about the food was worth going back for.   About the bill To sum it all up...this place is in need of some direction and managment to get a handle on what the kitchen is putting out and control the service staff. It feels like they spend more time on the name of the dishes then anything else. The food is tasteless, the presentation is comical, and the staff is pushy.  They have a great name, great location, and amazing potential but it's obvious that repeat business is not a priority.   Here is my free advise:  First step, lower the prices. The food is not better then what my friends or I can cook at home so don't charge more then $17.00 for your most expensive meal.  Second, drop the a la carte crap and include some sides with each meal.  Finally, add a table wine that won't break the bank so people can have fun and let loose without spending their paycheck on drinks.",

Long review to say that we were treated very well for clearly not looking high class. The meal was outstanding and the prices were much less than other steak places. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "A group of ten of us came in on Saturday for a birthday dinner. Half the party got there early and sat in the bar area for a drink. The tag line is; Beef, booze, and broads. They do have all three. The beef was decent. I had the steak tartare and the New York strip. The tartare is the better of the two. The chopped salad with the peppercorn dressing was better than the caesar as well. That tend to be the trend with most of the items on their menu. If we ordered two items, one was the crowd favorite. I do have to make a special note about the jumbo lump crab cakes. They are spectacular. The separation in meat was impressive. It was predominantly crab. If you want to try more than one side, the option of pick any three for $15 is a small savings. The portions are big, so it is easy to share. We got the jumbo baked potato, corn brulee, and sweet potato wedges. The sweet potato was the favorite. It came with a honey jalapeno dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again if I went back.  As for booze, their bartenders are good. I have had better Manhattans, but it was nothing to frown upon. My friend tried a cable car for the first time and enjoyed it. Their specialty drinks all tailor towards the sweet cocktail drinkers.  The broads are present as well. As we were being sat, we saw a girl in a gown with a large head dress was walking around. Near the end, she asked if everything was to our liking.   If you are downtown and do not want to travel then it is a good option.",

    "text": "The bar and restaurant look beautiful. We booked a reservation before they opened to have our employee xmas party their for just our office staff(6 people). We were all excited about the new Oscar's. We arrived and were all seated on time. We ordered cocktails which were delivered promptly. The bread was delivered and was a little stale, I thought that was unusual for only be open 3 days, we asked for an extra basket of bread and initially the bus boy told us we could only have one, we told him to go ask the server. The bus boy came back with another basket of bread. We ordered some appetizers for the table. Appetizers arrived and were flavorful but not hot. There was a long wait in between appetizers and entrees which was ok because we were not in a hurry, but the server never came by to say when our entrees would be arriving. While waiting for entrees, Oscar Goodman did come in to the restaurant and said hello to several tables including ours which was a nice surprise. Our entrees finally arrived but were all cold. A few in our party just kept what they had and we sent a couple entrees back. My wife complained to the server about all the cold entrees and he sent over the manager. The manager apologized for problems and offered to buy our desserts. We finished all of our entree and the server informed us hewould bring out a platter of several desserts for us to share. Again we had a long wait for desserts. The server brought out a platter of tiramisu, cheesecake, creme brulee, and a chocolate cake of some kind. I was surprised to find every dessert tasted and looked like they were frozen and thawed out pre-made desserts. We are hoping these are just opening week problems. For the prices they charge we were expecting a much better steak house. There are 20 other steak houses in town that are less expensive and ten times better. Service issues, cold food, cheapy desserts, come on guys you can't blame it all on being opening week. I would rather you make 2 excellent fresh desserts from scratch than having a half dozen cheapy pre-made desserts. For the price they will have to do much better. We will probably give it a second chance. We are 25 year residents and have eaten everywhere in this town, we are not experts but we know a good dining experience and Oscar's did not cut it.",

The prime rib & the Spilotro-Steak were cooked perfectly to order, the Oscar  chopped salad was superb with the Blue cheese dressing & the TiraMisu Birthday desert was fantabulous. All in all the evening was a 5-star birthday celebration & we had a wonderful time. Hopefully the next time we go,Oscar will be there & we can  congratulate him in person.

    "text": "We tried this place when they first opened and had a wonderful meal with extremely attentive service. So when we needed a place to book a large birthday party, we tried Oscar's again, confident we'd made a good choice. IT WAS NOT! It was a disaster from the start. We got there at opening time so they could not have been too busy, yet our entire experience was the worst in every way. We got our first round of drinks then had to try several times to get our server's attention for refills. The wine steward dripped wine all over the table and on one guest's flatware, which she removed and never replaced. Despite our server's assurances he could accomodate some minor changes to an entree, the instructions were ignored. Several people received entirely wrong meals. The vegetables were served cold. The people who were incorrectly served prime rib instead of the nightly special were given horseradish sauce, however the person that actually did order the prime rib was not given any. Seems like a minor detail but at these prices attention to detail should be #1. So we spent the entire evening with some people eating their meals, some people waiting and eating the cold vegetables that were left on the table while the entrees were being re-done, and the manager hovering and trying to apologize and keep us updated on the status of the missing meals. After splurging on a limo to transport our group specifically to this place for dinner, and the total disappointment in our service, we really felt let down. The food did look appetizing but I for one was just too upset to even eat it once I finally got it. I am sorry to say we probably won't be back.",

Lots of people in the lounge area and other people left when the couldn't get a table.  However, the food and service in Simpatico's was excellent.  We started out with a nice bottle of wine and the waiter told us there was a seafood appetizer on Oscar's menu that we could get if we wanted - $26 a person but worth every penny of it!  Big oysters, shrimp, lobster, and king crab legs - fresh and tasty.  My date had the salmon with a creamy brandy sauce over linguine, she loved it and they gave her plenty, lol, she just finished her leftovers today.  I'm a ribeye person but hte waiter and the guy next to me highly recommended the Skinny Vinnie's NY Pizzaiola - a nice thick NY Strip steak with a roasted peppers and olives, cooked perfectly and well worth the price - same steak sold in Oscar's for more.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Sure they don't have the view of Fremont Street like Oscar's but you can get anything from Oscar's menu with no crowd.  Only flaw, bread was dry, but had a nice flavor.   We'll definitely be back!!!!!",

The Caesar salad was kind of blah. The bread they bring is so wonderful, you want to eat a lot, but you better save room for your entree. One of my tablemates ordered the rib eye and it was ginormous. She couldn't finish it, so someone else tried. He said it tasted totally different than the filet. He ordered the mac and cheese and was extremely happy with it.  A great place to splurge then walk it off under the lights of the Fremont street experience.",

The restaurant is quite nice and the service is very good. I liked hearing the live music from the lounge - the volume was just right and not too loud to disrupt dinner conversation. Reason for only three stars was the veal chop that turned out to be more than 50% fat. Very little meat on that chop and a real disappointment. The au gratin potatoes and corn souffle sides were delicious; plenty for two people to share. The asparagus spears were really large and pretty much tasteless. I would definitely come back to Oscars again but I would stick with a good steak.",

Visit Friday 3/29 at 7:30pm (We had reservations. The restaurant was only half-filled.)  The hostess was a young girl who was disinterested and lacked poise. She walked us to our table then pretty much pointed and walked away. Our table overlooked Fremont Street. The view was wonderful.  We sat without being greeted by a waiter or busboy for water for almost 10 minutes after being seated. We finally flagged the waiter down and he said, \"oh I'm sorry I didn't see you\". He had walked by us several times and even helped the table adjacent to us! He did not explain the menu choices, and we had to ask for a wine list. There were many, many other faux pas service-wise but I will not list them all.  The service was very, very disappointing.  The broad who visited our table was friendly and knowledgeable. Not pushy. We appreciated that.  The food was excellent! Hat's off to the chef! Our steaks were cooked to perfection and all three sides we chose were unique, delicious and nicely presented.  We love you Oscar and think your restaurant would be a hit if you cleaned up your service. Until then we will not be back, nor will we recommend your restaurant to our friends or colleagues.",

Bobby was very old school and everything you'd want in a waiter, attentive, able to make suggestions, point us in the right direction of ordering pretty and pretty much a class act. We started with the onion strings, which were pretty damn good. Then we ordered the filet which was seasoned and cooked perfectly and enough for two. We had three sides, the creamed spinach which was just okay, the au gratin potatoes and possibly the best corn I have ever had - the roasted corn brulee. Seriously get the corn, don't share it, actually order two. If you aren't a local, share because the the portions are generous and you can't really take leftovers in Vegas. But people please remember, this is a nice steak house so class it up - don't wear your booty shorts or your best looking bro shirt. Just because it overlooks Freemont Street doesn't mean you can slum it - it's not Outback for god's sake.",

They sat us at a window where we had a clear view into Fremont Street and our server Bobby was top notch.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous.  We certainly enjoyed our visit to Oscar's at the Plaza.  We are locals and we love eating out and we have truly found our new favorite place to eat.  We will take my parent's here the next time they come to visit.  RECOMMENDATION: I had the Carolyn's cute Prime Rib which was more than enough for two to feast on, I ordered a side of Mac n Cheese which I took home for a late night snack.  The portions are very generous and the sides are made for sharing!",

Then a 10+ minute wait for a server to approach us. Then only after we asked hosts if there was table service and was told that the waitress visiting with patrons seated at the bar was our server. Tasha, as we learned her name to be, came to serve us only after being approached by host. She took our drink order and the drinks were delivered another 10+ minutes later by a manager without requested garnish ( blue cheese olives ) and no napkin. A while later Tasha reappeared and asked how were our drinks - to which we responded no garnish no napkin - no recognition of bad service by Tasha. She asked our appetizer order - we said we changed our mind - in large part based on bad service, also because 4 of 5 offerings were seafood ( no beef based app in a steak house!).   Tasha comped our drinks. We left and went to rival Andiamos steakhouse at The D. Spent $100 on drinks and appetizers that were delicious and service was excellent!  Oscars needs to get their act together on service standard.",

    "text": "Steak & shtick -- of COURSE I had to check this place out!!!  I was a HUGE fan of the old steakhouse that used to be in that location; it was unpretentious and very reasonably priced steakhouse fare. Then they replaced it with that poseur-ass tapas joint, which thankfully didn't last...and now it's back to being a steakhouse, although a bit more expensive than the old steakhouse.  I'm guessing the new higher prices are to subsidize the cost of having Broads on the payroll -- sexy women in fake Marilyn Monroe costumes who sashay around the room from table to table, telling you all about Vegas. This was the main reason I went -- I wanted to see what these Broads were all about, in case I ever need a new job!  I pretty much expected it to be like at a strip club, with aggressive Broads forcing themselves on you, trying to make you buy them a drink or buy them dinner or pay their \"law school tuition\" (stripper-speak for coke and pills). But it wasn't that way at all!   The night I went (Friday) there was only one solitary Broad working the room...and she was very easygoing. She stopped by the table a few times to chat, and sat down once...but even when my friend offered to buy her dinner, she said she was too busy working the room! Her loss -- my friend is one of those guys who gives $100 bills to any bimbo who comes down the pike; she could have made some cash off him, easy! To her credit, though, she didn't pander. Nice!   Foodwise, it was average steakhouse fare -- no better, no worse than any other steakhouse. I had a caprese salad (very good), a petit filet ($32 and good) and a loaded baked potato. Bottle of wine, cocktails and sheesecake for dessert. The only real bummer was that the bar did not stock B&B, which we ordered as after-dinner drinks. Our waiter said they had Benedictine, which they could just mix with brandy to make B&B...but man, it tasted like ass! I think it was Benedictine & BENADRYL or something! Bleccchhh!  The service was ok -- we never did get a bread basket, and the table was never crumbed or anything. But this is NOT a hoity toity restaurant -- it's shtick! From the Oscar Goodman memorabilia all over the walls, to the Broads in their cheeseball gowns & feather boas, to the poor waiters in their cheap-looking pinstriped \"Mobster\" shirts and ties....it's more Disneyland than fine dining.  Which is fine by me! My friend and I made a day of it -- first we hit up the Mob museum, then took a leisurely stroll down Fremont St, and had dinner here. A very shticky day!  My one complaint is that the decor and ambiance is weirdly lacking. They went through all this trouble to hire Broads and get a live piano player in the lounge and basically re-create an old-time swanky Vegas steakhouse...and then they furnished it with what looks like leftovers from a 1998 cruise ship! Boring, uninspired and drab -- boo!! How about some really cool, retro, vintage swank? Right now, the lounge area isn't even cool enough to bother stopping in for a drink :-( You'd get more atmosphere in a Holiday Inn!  Step it up, Oscar!",

We heard about Oscar's in a travel magazine, so decided to give it a try.     Loved it.  The service was excellent.   We were cheerfully greeted at the hostess desk.   Not having a reservation was okay.   We were seated in the cocktail lounge while we waited for a table.   We were promptly served Manhattans.   Drinks were what you expect from classic steak house.   Good, but not over the top like LA can get.   Bar staff were excellent.  Our table became quickly available.   The bar staff had an excellent handle on the progress of our dining table, offering information without being asked.  Our waiter was awesome.  The steaks were 5 stars.   Great pieces of beef.   The table ordered prime rib and filets.  All were excellent, on par with other great steak houses we have experienced in LA, NYC, Kansas City, and Chicago.     We'll be back.  Great meal and memory.",

He made us feel comfortable and was all smiles and laughter.  This place was highly recommeded and we were glad we went there. We had an amazing view and enjoyed our dinner. My husband was happy he got to have his favorite meal, a steak dinner. Lol. Overall, great experience and amazing waiter!",

Our party had 4 guests and 3 different types of steak ordered, wow they really know how to prepare a steak.  The east coast oysters were great except for 1, in which case our amazing server promptly replaced it with a fresh pair of perfect ones.  My heavens, Tasha and Chanta couldn't have been more attentive on a busy Saturday night.    Cody, nice work on leading a great team.  I hope you never change the servant leadership attitude, it will take you safely and successfully to the top of whatever ladder you want to climb.  It was very impressive to see you walk that women out to her safe place, just like a perfect gentleman.  Cheers my friends, and thanks for some great pictures and memories, oh yeah, Tasha, thank you for the bandaid and sorry about the wine glass:)",

I could have had better service at a lower end restaurant. Not once did we get asked if we would like another drink as both our water glasses and drink glasses were completely empty for half of our time here. Also, every other table received a basket of bread before their meal but we did not. Then, when we sat for about 15 minutes with empty plates we were finally brought our bill. We waited another ten minutes for our waiter to come back to close out our check and he never did. So we literally had to get up and find another waiter to close our bill out. I will never visit this restaurant again and I highly recommend that you do not waste your money here either.",

(there's a bunch of drink & appetizer specials, plus we each got a free glass of wine for checking in on Yelp.) comfy barstools, lots of room for us to spread out and eat, convenient purse-hooks under every seat. the only ding for ambiance is that the bar was SUPER loud (and only got louder about halfway into our meal) and i could barely talk to my friend without SCREAMING at her. service-wise, Steve was a gem. (not to mention fine as helllll. hey boo hey.)  the food was delicious. i had the beef carpaccio. (which was on special for $9, usually it's $17.) next time i'll order it sans capers, but the beef & mustard aoili were both delicious. i also had the burrata & heirloom tomato salad with microgreens which was killer. my friend had the spicy flank steak, which was insane. i may have to get it next time. if you're the type of person to get excited about finding whole cloves of spicy garlic hiding in your steak, this is the dish for you.  if you're staying downtown and craving steak, Oscar's is an extremely solid choice. (but i'd stick to Happy Hour if you're not looking to spend $$$$.) my only reason for withholding that 5th star is the loudness of the music/stereo system. nobody wants to be screaming at their dinner companion at 5:00pm, yo.",

The atmosphere is great, they have a huge bar area with live music, and the dining room itself is in a glass dome overlooking Fremont St. It's definitely a great view. Our server, Lenore, was awesome. We started with the house made ricotta which came with toast and a tomato/caper relish. It was fantastic. We had the Caesar salad and it was very good. I ordered the filet with Bearnaise sauce, it was cooked to perfection. Husband ordered the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp and he loved them. We ordered the selection of 3 sides - corn brulee, baked potato, and macaroni and cheese. They were all great. Lenore made some great suggestions for dessert, we ended up with chocolate mousse and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. Perfect ending to an outstanding meal. Highly recommend!",

After experiencing issues, service was slow to return to table. GM sent birthday dessert to table as part of recovery but noticed other tables celebrating also received same desserts.

Very nice decor, and the view, looking straight down Fremont St, in an all glass wall and ceiling is tough to beat.  Bar area was also very nice.  The problem was with the food and service.  Food tasted good, however my filet was ordered medium rare, and came out cool, nowhere close to hot.   The larger issue was, someone at the table had a good amount of sentiment in the bottom of his wine glass.  Not sure what it was, but they were the size of grass blades.   When pointed out to the server, he did nothing, and offered nothing - not even replacing the glass.    Finally, while the server was friendly, he was far too friendly.   We were not there to socialize with him.  He hung around the table far too long, telling jokes, sharing stories.  Some of our party did ask hiim some questions, and he was wonderful in answering.   He just didn't seem to understand when enough was enough.  We will not return.",

We were seated right in the middle of the window facing Fremont street. It would be the most amazing view if it wasn't for the zip line tower right in the center blocking the entire street. The only you can see now is the top dome of Fremont street. I'm not docking  star due to something out of their control.   The service is amazing and the staff & ambiance is so old school Vegas & steak house. Every person was so attentive & friendly. Constantly cleaning, setting up table, refilling drinks, checking in with us to make sure everything tasted to our liking.   Their drinks were so fresh and delicious. Definitely made with fresh ingredients. I forgot the name of our drinks, but I ordered the vodka with fresh strawberries & blackberries & the hubs ordered a vodka with pineapple. Both were so delicious but not sweet. Very refreshing.   For our first round we ordered the crab cakes (all crab with zero filling), shrimp cocktail (jumbo shrimp with fresh horseradish cocktail sauce. Best cocktail sauce I think I have ever had) and the wedge salad (fresh blue cheese & thick cut bacon). Everything was amazing & fresh.   For our entree we shared the bone in ribeye, jumbo loaded baked potato & creamed spinach. The ribeye had the the perfect crust & seasoning and was cooked to the perfect medium. The baked potato was seriously jumbo. We split it in two and we couldn't even finish our halves. And the creamed spinach was more like a cheesy spinach  I don't think I would get the spinach next time.   We ended our dinner with coffee & the presented us with a little anniversary gift of chocolate covered strawberries.   For the quality, ambiance & price, this will now be one of my go to steakhouses in Vegas.",

Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Experience 4.5/5  Full disclosure: the restaurant experience is great. I'll review that first.  We were seated in the main dining area. It's an airy, bright, but old school feel steak house. The circular dining room is unique, and the window ceiling is so cool. I really enjoyed the early evening meal under the Vegas lights.  I had the bone-in filet and the wife had the 8 oz filet. Cooked to order, tasted like it was seared under a salamander, had a nice salt and pepper crust that was not intrusive. Bone in was a good value at $55. Service was on par with a standard nice restaurant. Prompt water refills, and staff was cognizant of our need to make our show time, which makes the end of the evening so confusing.  One of the reasons we were attracted to Oscars (besides the reputation), was that the restaurant had a free shuttle to the Smiths Center. We had no problem with the valet or the shuttle driver but to our surprise when we returned we found out there was a $15 charge to pick up our car.  I hate posting reviews where something like this sours the experience but it felt like such a bait and switch I couldn't help the deduction. The ironic part is that if I had known it was $15 to valet ahead of time I wouldn't be upset. Instead I felt cheated. With the number of options in Vegas, and most places not looking to nickel and dime you, I'm sure there's a better option. Try Golden Steer or Top of Binions, I've never felt cheated at either.  Perhaps if they are more upfront on the policy or realize that a nice dinner and a show takes more than four hours I may return, but until then let this review serve as a warning to potential theater goers. Learn from our mistake.",

We go every year.This year we decided to try Oscar's. We had a fabulous experience! The restaurant has a remarkable setting and view. The restaurant is elegant and with a great wait staff. My wife had the scallops and risotto and fortunately she shared. It was absolutely amazing! The risotto was cooked perfectly. My meal was no slouch either. It was the best chicken breast dinner I have ever had. I loved the preparation.  It was what seemed to be very lightly fried. I couldnt believe how wonderful it tasted! The last thing I will add is that the prices are very reasonable for what you get. Oscar's is now my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Highly recommended!",

The bread crust before the meal, was crunchy on the outside and soft of the inside. The calamari was good, but not as good as I have had at some other places. It was a little too fried, but still pretty tasty. The 8 oz filet and potatoes were cooked perfectly and we will definitely be back to celebrate other special occasions.

I know they hate that) but regardless even though I'm sure the staff was tired and ready to be done for the night our waiter greeted us with a sincere smile and followed with great service! We had the crab cake appetizer which was very good! But my steak is something I dream about to this day! I have never had a steak melt into my mouth like this one! I swear it GET THE FILET MIGNON!  It is a nice place with a great 360 view of Fremont street.  It was my husband and myself we each had a cocktail, an appetizer and both had a steak for dinner. Our tab was $200 and worth every penny! We tipped generously and left so full we couldn't even party, we had to go back to our room and pass out in a food coma .  The photos make the steaks looks small (they were not! Super thick and large! My phone does them No justice!!! Thank you oscars for the top notch service, delicious food and great views! Next time we are in Vegas we will be back!!",

Second everyone - maitre d, drinks server, waitress, and manager were on point, welcoming, attentive without bugging too much. They made us feel welcome and special - even though we were dressed very casually and not spending a ton on drinks and wine. Just great service. Third, WONDERFUL food. Our party of four each had a different entree - the rib cap (very hard to find), the filet, the flat iron, and the pork chop - and all four of us were impressed. Great food. Fifth, you will get out of here about 20-30 bucks less per person across the board compared to the strip steakhouses, which is good too, especially as most of them are very cookie cutter IMHO.   Finally, walking around Fremont street after is just great fun, lots of weirdness and a different part of Vegas that is worth seeing.   All in all this was a great evening - we will go back to Oscars, for sure.",

    "text": "Oh no, what's happened to this steakhouse? My absolute favorite thing about it was the different crab options. My wife ordered the crab cake appetizer and it's completely different. Very few bigger pieces and SO fishy. Like, if there wasn't a mayo based sauce on it; it would be unbearable to eat. Shrimp cocktail too was underwhelming, shrimp was soft just didn't have a good flavor. Salad was good, but at the end of the day; it's hard to screw up a salad.   For dinner my wife went with the king crab which was a shocking disappointment. The crab didn't even fill the shell. There were large gaps in between  the sides of the shell. This wasn't cheap and that's what made me angry. The steak was solid, but getting it Oscar style was a mistake too since that's where I got a shell from the crab in my mouth. (Disgusting)   Supposedly they had a chef change according to my server and I wish I had known that before we went. There are many great options for a steakhouse in downtown and I always felt Oscars was a great option. But sadly, quality has gone way downhill. Go to the The D steakhouse, Hugo's Cellar, or Golden Steer. Much, much better.",

So onto the service and food. We were lucky enough to get a server who's been in the game for years and even served people like Sinatra & Elvis. He was charming and really made the entire experience that much more special.   The food was awesome! Classic preparations and generous portions. Steaks were juicy and tender, salads were filling, sides were cooked perfectly and we kept the drinks coming. Check-in on yelp and receive a complimentary glass of house wine.

Once you enter the casino, just take the elevators to the second floor and Oscar's will be right there!  We dined here as a party of seven and really enjoyed a fantastic meal here!  (+) Happy Hour specials run from 4-7 pm every single day of the week! Fair and reasonable prices on drinks and some great apps as well. I had never had crab cakes ($9) before coming here and they were outstanding! A perfect way to kick things off! Be aware that these specials only apply to the bar area and NOT the dining room area. (+) We were sat down in the dining area with a very picture-esque view of the Fremont Street Experience and the Golden Gate Casino! A fantastic back drop for a fine meal! (+) I ordered the New York Strip ($48) cooked medium rare. We also opted for their special of 3 sides for $22. We enjoyed the mac and cheese, the mashed potatoes, and the roasted corn brulee.   The steak was outstanding! Very juicy and tasty! A great portion size that was satisfying and filling. The sides were a-ok, if not spectacular.  (+) Service was outstanding! Our server, Bobby, was funny and engaging and provided stellar service to us all. My water glass never reached even close to empty and our other drinks (Stellas, Newcastles) were brought out quickly and set up for us. Great service was definitely provided! (+) Ambiance and vibe was very freaking cool. This is a steakhouse with an old school Vegas feel to it. If you know me at all, you know I LOVE that stuff all day long!   This was a fantastic experience! While not necessarily cheap, it is fairly priced, especially when compared to some other Steakhouses in town. I would definitely come here again. If anything, I can see coming back for just some of those HH specials and crab cakes!   4 stars.  I am absolutely a fan!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place (because I love Oscar Goodman). But I can only give it 3 1/2 stars. The food was OK, and maybe in another city this would be the best resturuant in town....but Vegas has so many outstanding steakhouses, that Oscar's seems to be mediocre in comparison. My dinning companion and I both ordered the same thing, crab cake appetizer, and NY strip steak with a lobster tail. The crab cakes were good, and so was the steak. But at most high end steakhouses in Vegas, the steaks come out perfectly seasoned, where you don't need to put anything on it at all....that was not the case with Oscars (you will definitely need the salt and pepper shaker for this entree). We also had the steaks topped with mushrooms. The mushrooms were good, but they were not sauteed, so they were a little dry and lacked some seasoning. The lobster tail had a slight unusual flavor....it is hard to describe....but I would say it had a hint of woody/nutty flavor to it. As for the location and decor: We ate in the main dinning room, overlooking Fremont street (by the way, anyone who is a fan of the movie Casino will recognize this place immediately, as one of the resturuants the Robert De Niro character has a big fight with his wife at). The resturant's view is not as good as it used to be, as a large two story platform was built at the end of Fremont Street, which blocks a good portion of the resturant's view of Fremont street (I am not sure if this structure is permanent or temporary, but it definitely is a view blocking eye sore). The interior decor is nice, but nothing exceptional (certainly no where near as elegant as some of the high end resturuants on the strip). But it does have an old world Vegas charm that you may find appealing. Overall, this is a decent resturuant, but there are so many better steakhouse resturuants in Vegas (in the same price range), that Oscar's would not be my top choice.",

Yes there are photos of the Mayor on one wall and a few others here and there but bottom line is that the room was generic with WHITE SHEER CURTAINS  on the windows !! I think they are still waiting for what they really ordered !! The bar is really bright and reminded me of a coffee shop lighting. There was a baby grand right in the middle of the bar area but even though it was a Saturday night nobody was playing it. The food was just okay. Lobster bisque was brown. I've NEVER seen brown bisque before and it was watery. Skirt steak had whole cloves of raw garlic pushed into the meat as if they forgot it and then added at the last minute. It came with literally a tablespoon of the worst mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. No need to go on and on but the fact is that if the Mayor's name wasn't on the place it would be empty !!",

    "text": "Oscar's proves that you don't have to dine on The Strip to have a great meal.  We have been here several times and will definitely be back for more.    The chopped salad is fantastic and is a meal in and of itself.  It is more than your typical chopped salad and has great texture from the candied pecans and onion strings.    The chicken soup was just so-so.  I didn't eat most of it and wouldn't order it again.  The lobster tail is incredible.  You can order it as an add-on to any other entree.  One of our guests ordered a steak and I had the lobster tail as my entree.  I wish that you could order the lobster by itself, so if two of us go and we both want lobster and nothing else, we can get it.  And, perhaps you can and the waiters will accommodate, but from the menu, it clearly states that you can add on the lobster to an entree.    The side dish combinations are also a good selection.  You can pick any 3 sides for $15.  We've had mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and baked potato.  All delicious.  We've also ordered the Ahi sashimi as an appetizer and it didn't disappoint.  The view from the dome is incredible.  Make a reservation for dinner when the Fremont Street Experience light show will be on, and ask to sit near the window.  You won't hear the music, but you will see a great light show and possibly some interesting characters!  Oscar's also has some fantastic live music at the bar, who will entertain you as you sip cocktails.    Buxom ladies walk around and visit you at your table (hence, the \"broads,\" in \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\").  It's kind of corny and slightly uncomfortable, but I won't hold it against Oscar's.  It's not like Vegas is known for being a refined and classy place.  If sequinned and silicone'd vixens are going to fit in anywhere, it's Vegas.",

After reading the reviews of the various restaurants downtown, we decided to try Oscar's.  This may be the best experience we had during the entire visit - We each had the Filet with Oscar \"over the top\", the chopped salad, and creamed spinach.  Everything was delectable, with a huge thumbs up on the chopped salad!!    Our server (turned sommelier) was extremely courteous and prompt and was very knowledgeable when it came to assisting us in choosing the perfect wine to pair with our meal - Like the food, the service was exceptional.  The atmosphere was perfect for Old Vegas and really encompasses the glitz and glam that one would expect.  My husband put it perfectly when he said he expected Dean Martin to walk in with a cigarette and a martini in hand!! The view of Fremont Street, the piano player, and the laid back \"lounge\" feel was just perfect.    In closing, I will say that anyone visiting Vegas should not miss Oscar's!! Truly a top notch place!!",

The steaks that my husband and dad ordered were both rare when they ordered medium. I am a vegetarian and was forced to pay $25 for a plate with squash, asparagus (smallest stalks I have ever seen), and half of a stewed tomato. I wish the manager would have cared, but all he told us was that the grill gets overworked and by the end of the night it doesn't cook the steaks right. The waiter was okay, but the whole experience made me realize I will not be attending Oscar's again. If you're going to dinner for an amazing steak, skip this place and go for Capital Grille instead.",

I've eaten at various steak places in the past without this issue, however, the waiter told me this was normal for what I ordered.  Though I was highly skeptical,  I ate it, but needed steak sauce in order to dilute the burnt taste I had. I felt this steak was lackluster at best.  I had to ask to have my water refilled, though the waiter wasn't shy to ask if I wanted more wine.  For the amount of money I spent, I would have thought that automatic water refills would be a given.   I was also surprised that there was no bread, which is standard in nearly all restaurants.  I thought the overall vibe lacked a homely-friendly sense that I look for.  Perhaps this is reflected in the small details, such as the ones I described above.  While the staff were friendly, I did not feel it to be genuine.   There are much better places in Vegas, both in terms quality of food and atmosphere.  That said, the decorum and style of this restaurant is very nice, as are their mixed drinks.",

I am giving this establishment 4 stars because the waitstaff was somewhat flustered, loud, and short with us at the beginning of the evening due to their computer system being down. They could have handled the situation better, but they did redeem themselves a bit later in the evening. However, I would give the food and the atmosphere 5 stars. Everything we had was delicious.The dining room is gorgeous at night. It is located in a glass domed room with 3 chandeliers in the center of the circular room.  From the meatball appetizer, to the entrees (Spilotro Steak and Sea Bass entrees) to the side dishes (augratin potatos, bacon brussel sprouts, macaroni & cheese, and asparagus), every bite was enjoyable and reasonably-priced. I recommend if you're looking for delicious food and are willing to travel away from the strip for a nice, reasonably-priced dinner.",

Food was good but the service...  first off even though we were sat at 9:30pm we were still rushed to order, literally, even though we obviously were studying the cocktail menu it was our food order they asked for first. After our steak was served my birthday wife was dying for a nice glass of red wine to match up with the steak it took way too long for a server to check back! Why I said unfortunately it was my wife's birthday is the key!! So our server was nice enough to treat her to a dessert for her birthday but when we asked about the desserts she said it's going to be a slice of cheesecake; we asked to see the dessert menu; she responded \"i can't afford any other dessert for her!\" Firstly; as if she's actually paying for it, and secondly: all the desserts are 7$!!  So before we got a chance to order a dessert they put the cheesecake in front of her! I would have rather paid $7 to give her what she wants on her birthday! I'm already paying  $60 for a steak! So now when it comes to her birthday dessert we have to settle for what they have in mind, rather than me spending $7 to give my birthday girl what she wants?!?!? But that's not even the end of the story! I ordered her a glass of ice wine$25! (But, once again;how dare we choose our own  $7 dessert) from inniskillin, where i grew up. I though it would be a good pairing with that stupid cheesecake that was forced upon her. This is where it gets crazy!!!! We both swear that the wine was watered down!! I know that's  a big accusation, but it's viscosity was like water (i grew up where it's from,so i know!) And you could just taste the watered down flavor of it. So I'm assuming that it was the last of the bottle and they added water to get it up to the level in the glass to be acceptable! Poor birthday girl!!! And why???",

    "text": "Worst dinning experience in a while. I and my husband enjoy fine dinning in Las Vegas but this restaurant was truly horrible.  We went to this place after a Saturday show at the Smith Center. I ordered the Halibut dish, and my husband ordered the Ahi Tuna, along with 3 side dishes (Cream spinach, mashed potato and onion strings). Our friends ordered calamari for appetizer and prime rib and shrimp salad for main dishes. 10 minutes after our order, our waiter informed us there was no more Ahi tuna nor Halibut for the day. The only seafood they served was Tilapia, and per waiter it was supposedly sublime.  The Tilapia turned out to be super greasy and overcooked. And our friend's $61 prime rib was over cooked as well. All side dishes were tolerable, but definitely very greasy. We also had wine here which was not too memorable.  When our bill came out, we were surprised that they charged us each additional  $10 for \"Oscar's top\" which we did not order. Per waiter, it was the creamy sauce they placed on top of the Tilapia dish, which they did not tell us about in the first place. Since there was no Tilapia on the menu, the waiter went on to charge me $38 for my Tilapia dish, and charged my husband $41 for his. I have no idea why the pricing was different although we got identical dishes. Upon questioning, the waiter mumbled something, and since I don't like to argue in a high end restaurant we just paid and left.  I would not had given the restaurant 1 star had my husband not gotten so sick from the food the following day. My husband had nausea sensation for the following 24 hours, and some diarrhea. I also had mild nausea, but symptoms more mild. Overall, for a $80 per person meal, I can think of many other places to go to",

    "text": "Look, I'm not going to lie-- I was skeptical.  Very skeptical.  One might even say scared.  Other Yelp reviewers have torn this place apart.  But the hubby had his heart set on Oscar Goodman's name sake, and so we made reservations and went for Valentine's Day.  And in all honesty I really enjoyed myself!  I'm not sure why some other horrendous reviews.  Yes, my review is long, but I'm trying to help others.  Here's how I see it:  Service:  2 1/2 stars. While I hope Oscar's management takes my whole review to heart, this is the area they need to take most seriously.  Our waiter was nice enough, but not the best I've ever had.  Both the hostesses (those at the front desk who check in reservations and those that seat guests) and bussing staff were, well, lackluster--hard to get a read either way.  Quite honestly the two best staff members I met during the evening was the general manager circulating the room and our food runner who always came by with a smile.  To those complaints from other reviewers that say their waiter was never seen between order and bill-- apparently we didn't dine at the same restaurant, because friendly or not, all the staff was present.  I will agree however that all of the staff could use an afternoon seminar on smiling and saying \"Yes.\"  Food:  3 1/2 stars.  The food itself was more like 4 stars (I am clueless what poor reviewers have been eating--most everything we had was wonderful), but the menu selection gets them \"knocked down\" a 1/2 if not a full star in my book.  I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one pasta dish on the menu, and because I'm not a steak fan (hubby is a fanatic) the pasta is what I always order.  However, Oscar's does not have a single one.  When I inquired of the waiter if a pasta request could be accomodated (I know they share a kitchen with sister restaurant Italian \"Simpatico,\" so this shoudn't be impossible.) he stated that I could see a Simpatico menu, but if I wanted to order off that, we would have to be re-seated in that room.  That's ridiculous!  My husband wants the Oscar's menu, and we both want appetizers and desserts from your menu, all I'm asking for is a pasta entree from the kitchen.  I had already even viewed the Simpatico menu and was going to order one of the most expensive dishes!  (Pricier than what I ended up ordering off Oscar's real menu, oh well, your loss of a bigger check, Mr. Waiter.)  Anyway, I pieced together a dinner for myself.  I started with the lobster bisque--5 stars!  It was atypical an delicious!  It has large pieces of lobster in it, which I've never been served before when I order the dish at other restaurants.  Then I had the crab cake \"appetizer\" as my entree and a side of sweet potato fries.  4 1/2 stars for the crab cakes--very little filler and lots of lump crab meat.  3 1/2 stars on the fries--delicious, and they sprinkle them generously with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  My husband started with the caesar salad, and then the cedar planked salmon and a baked potato.  In his words, all three items were solid 4's.  And we both agreed--the free onion bread--5 stars all the way!!!!  My disappointment was dessert.  We ordered the triple chocolate mousse (which the food runner called triple chocolate cake as he delivered it, so the house doesn't even know what it is) and it arrived still partly frozen.  Sorry, Oscar's, but please jump off the \"thawed-pre-made-desserts\" bandwagon and make your own.  Even if you specialized in just one or two and could recommend those to the customers and the rest were pre-made.  Decor and Ambience:  4 1/2 stars.  Near perfect.  \"Old School Vegas\" as my husband calls it, and what we were both hoping for.  So many places here in Las Vegas nowadays are some hip interior designer's idea of \"new and fancy.\"  That has it's place and time, don't get me wrong, but I really do enjoy occasionally going to a place that makes me feel like I've stepped back in time.  Oscar's is definitely upscale, and has fashionable decor with it's faux-croc upholstered booths, and metallic chairs and couches, but still feels classic, and cliche as it may be, like I said, \"old school.\"  My only caveat is the way the music \"competes.\"  There is a live piano player in the bar, which is great for that area's ambience.  However, they play canned music in the dining room, and because the restaurant is not huge, when dining you hear both.  This not only makes for an overly loud atmosphere that makes hearing the waiter and your dining companion hard, but is annoying due to the two different battling tunes.  If anything, Oscar's, I would skip the piped music.  Final note-- The floating \"Broads\": Unnecessary and tacky.  They didn't approach us, I'm assuming because it was Valentine's Day, but they were there.  And I just find it insulting that Oscar's believes these women are appropriate for a restaurant that should be catering to couples with quite a bit of money to spend on a nice date night out.",

I had a Bellini of all drinks -lol and my wife had a free Corona.  We ordered the sliders, crab cakes and meatballs, which were all discounted for happy hour. The Sliders were amazing and had some sort of either marinade or teriyaki taste to them.  my wife had the crab cakes and said it was the best she had and the meatballs were fluffy and filling!  We were hoping to meet Oscar but was told he only shows up early in the week. The bartender was friendly and inviting. This place is upscale and almost seems out of place to be in the Plaza Casino/Hotel.  Thanks Oscars and we'll see you again in June!",

VALUE: A+ (same steaks as everyone else just a bit less) QUALITY: A (solid wait staff and very \"old school\" and knowledgeable) WINE: B+ (they have everything, but this isnt a place for flying sommelier)  not really a family place and its slightly loud and a little bit of a crowded feeling, but get a booth and the view of downtown and you will see your dollar stretch further without the expense of food or service",

The sad part was there wad an event going on so the parking was $20 bucks! We were only there for 2 hours. By the time I saw the sign I had already paid for parking. It would have been a nice gesture if the hostess or server would have had sense to make mention to anyone coming in to dine just incase they drove in. Price point is great under 200 for a steak dinner. Server Robert was ok, not super chatty just took our order, answered some questions and hit the road. Food came out quickly, a little undercooked for a medium well steak but nonetheless my husband enjoyed it.  I ordered a glass of wine, I'm use to getting a taste before fully pouring to ensure I liked it. Nope, server just poured amd again kept it moving. Unfortunately I didnt love the wine but since it was poured Im not going to let the drink go to waste. We were there for my husbands bday, I made reservations through opentable and put notes that we were celebrating his bday. There were 3 bdays in the restaurant everyone got a slice of dessert and us nothing. I dont feel like i need to run up to tell the server...fail on the hostess for sure for not reading notes and passing it along to the server. The hostess was a gentleman didnt catch his name. Overall the ambiance was nice, food was decent, not my fav and wont rush back. Giving 4 stars because my husband thought it was good. The view was the best part.",

From the jazzy style pianist and singer to the thick white table clothes and well dressed servers.  There was even a lady in an old school performer costume walking around asking how people were doing.  The view is great from the main dining area and I absolutely loved the circular window looking over Fremont Street.  Our service was great and the food was good too.  I wish for the price they would do more than A La Carte but that seemed to be the normal practice at the majority of nice restaurants I dined at while visiting Las Vegas.    I had the 22oz rib eye, mashed potatoes and an Old Fashioned.  For a $65 steak I wanted the cut of meat, flavor, marbling and all that good stuff  to blow me away as much as the presentation.... Presentation - 10 Flavor - 7.5  Either way it was a great meal and an even better experience.  Thanks to the cab driver for suggesting it.",

The view did not disappoint. It overlooked the west end of Fremont Street and the ambiance of the restaurant was great.  The service and the food, however, left us feeling sour.  The waitstaff, excluding one bus person, were rude. For whatever reason our waiter seemed to be picking on my girlfriend, seemingly annoyed that she was sitting there.  We watched as he was so hospitable to a couple sitting next to us, and wondered what we had done wrong to make him treat us so differently, and to be frank, badly.  He never came back and checked up on us for both the appetizer and entree courses and only saw him when he asked if we were interested in dessert. If he had checked up on us at all, he would have known that we were not satisfied with the food.  I do have to say, not all the food was bad.  We ordered the calamari and crab cakes for appetizer, which my girlfriend got picked on when ordering it by the waiter.  The apps were tasty.  The calamari, which lacked a bit of seasoning, were crispy and went well with the marinara sauce.  The crab cakes were not dry and flavored well with huge chunks of crabs.  The entree, however was not great.  We ordered the New York strip and it came, borderline burnt.  The burnt-ness came through on every bite and masked all of the natural meat flavors, ruining the steak.  We would have complained except the waiter was no where to be found.  But I guess it was my fault for not waving him down.  For the price I would patronize other steakhouses on the strip, or even chains like Morton's or Fleming's. I did not enjoy my experience here. I would only recommend the place for its views and maybe their appetizers. We didn't try anything else on the menu so I can't say much on that.",

My wife had a soup that was lukewarm and needed reheating. I ordered a brandy Manhattan on the rocks and the waiter served it straight up,  Instead of bringing me the correct one, she brought me a glass of ice and proceeded to pour the original drink into the glass of ice right at the table. We ordered tiramisu for dessert, and they brought it to the table still frozen.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor at all.  For a , regular prime rib eater, this was the worst!!!!!  Never be back, as well as my many Las Vegas friends and neighbors.      By the way, my wife just reminded me that her entree, shrimp stuffed crab, could have been a TV dinner.  NEVER AGAIN.

The man is a treasure trove of stories and you shouldn't miss an opportunity to hear him talk about the good ol days.  As for the restaurant, what a great spot! Awesome views of downtown and the bar has a cool vibe. Pick up the Oscar's signature martini.  Our dinner was banquet style for this event and they pulled it off swimmingly. Lots of choices. Service was top notch. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly. And the best part of the night was not once was my wine glass empty. Cheers to having a hit with Oscar's!",

Of course the view of Fremont street is an added bonus.",

    "text": "Mixed reviews. Oscars is pricey and elegant.   The bisque came recommended by bingo tournament attendees in the past. The bisque didn't disappoint and was beautiful. Best I've ever had.  Restaurant was dimly lit. I guess so that the Fremont experience can be the main attraction. My aunt had her back to Fremont and thought the reflected lights from the building was the original view.  I recommend the beet salad and bisque. Bread was tough on the outside, soft on the inside. Basket came free for the table.   My aunt with the sensitive teeth  only ate the bread insides. She normally cannot eat crunchy salads but the beet salad wowed her. She vowed to try to duplicate it at home.   The Aunt with the strong choppers dipped her bread crust in the bisque.   I had the crab  cakes and They were good but Phillip's Maryland crab cakes (in Baltimore) still get the blue ribbon in my book.  We had tiramisu which has actual rum alcohol in it. The teetotaler aunt didn't like it. It was smooshed in a cup like a bread pudding with shaved chocolate on top instead of being delicately layered and dusted with cocoa. Other aunt is inspired to add coffee and rum to her capirotada (Mexican bread pudding).  There is a happy hour before 7 in the bar lounge and it includes appetizer specials. We aim to try that next time.  Minus 2 stars  because they had a premium table that we requested to sit at but was told it was reserved. My elderly aunts watched it sit empty until close. Tsk tsk tsk, just tacky.",

Great ambiance in the circular dining area that consists glass ceilings and walls which give you a great view of the Fremont Street Experience.  Dimly lit for intimacy and the staff is sharply dressed.  You definitely get a date night or special occasion dinner feel here.  Oscar's Cuisine:  The crab cakes were a phenomenal appetizer.  Generous in size and packed with flavor, they were very filling.  Our tables shared the mashed potato, creamed spinach and the roasted mushrooms.  All were good but the roasted mushrooms stood out for me in terms of flavor to compliment your dish. I had the Leib's Lamb Chops mint demi glace and it was delish.  You get two smaller Lamb Chops in your order, think of filet portions but it was tender and savory.  Overall, everyone at the table was happy with their dishes.  I wish the portions were a little more generous as I've come across similar quality with more quantity at other steakhouses.  Oscar's Steakhouse has premium strip pricing but offers a one of a kind ambiance with great service.  They are definitely social media friendly and a Steakhouse to check out.  Cheers!",

    "text": "We were going to be in the Plaza hotel around dinner time so decided to look up the dining options on the website. There wasn't much, but the reviews to this steakhouse were good so we planned to stop by. I called to make sure there wasn't a specific dress code and the lady that answered the phone had such a bad attitude it made me debate if I even wanted to go here. Luckily, I chalked it up to her just having a rough day and am happy I made the decision to eat here!  We arrived with no reservation and was told the wait for the dining room was 20 minutes. The bar area was empty and still had plenty of tables/booths so we ate in that section. If you're going for the view you hear everyone talk about in their reviews, definitely sit in the dining room; you won't see much of Fremont from the bar section.   If you check in on yelp, you get a free glass of wine. Score! You can choose between a small list of red or white. For dinner, I went with the bone-in ribeye and baked potato. The rib eye was so juicy and flavorful, I almost ate the whole 24 oz. I was pretty full and only took a couple bites of my baked potato but from what I tasted, I would definitely get it again and make sure I save room for it.",

Located inside the Plaza hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas, this place could truly stand on its own.    Came here with a friend who has dined here prior, and it didn't disappoint.  Appetizers of meatballs and corn and crab bisque didn't disappoint, both were delicious and delivered with a quickness.  The Oso Bucco was literally to die for.  Soft and tender meat that fell off the bone.    Also, if you checked in on yelp you get a free glass of wine!  That was an awesome surprise.  The wait staff was professional and gave their opinions when asked about certain entrees and appetizer selections, and also what cocktail was the best.    You can valet park here specifically for Oscars steakhouse which makes it nice.    The place is clean and classy and overlooks the tail west end of the Fremont street experience. What a great place to dine, I cannot say enough good things about this place.  I will make this one of my go to steakhouses now in Las Vegas.",

We started out with the shrimp cocktail. Those 3 shrimp were HUGE! The cocktail sauce was probably the best I've ever had. Very, very tasty!   I got the skirt steak, which I loved. It had garlic and chili infused taste and was super buttery. Just perfect. A little dollop of mashed potatoes that wasn't too indulgent, but just lovely. My wife had the filet Oscar style. I will get that next time. It was magnificent! She out ordered me for sure. Big chunks of crab, the asparagus was brilliantly cut and cooked. It was amazing! For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse (it's gluten-free) and I loved it. She did too.   There were 3 cocktails I wanted to try on the menu, but the first one was so generous that I had to stop after that one. WOW!!! You should absolutely go to Oscar's Steakhouse if you want an amazing meal in a great atmosphere!",

He took the charge off for the soup and gave us 3 free delicious desserts for a birthday treat.  I would go back.",

    "text": "The hubby and I went here on our last night in Vegas. We set our expectations pretty high, considering it's a higher end establishment, and that was probably our first mistake.   The Service: 1 star. It was awful. The only pleasant person was the sweet hostess that seated us immediately. Then the lady who took our drink order came over. I ordered hot tea and my hubby just wanted water. Normally when you order tea they tell you the options. Nope, not her. She brought me my least favorite tea and took off. Then I had to flag her down for sugar and she grabbed it from right near us before I could ask if they had honey. Then I ask for honey and she proceeds to take the sugar. Ummm, I wanted both! Next our server comes and takes our order.   Food: our tomahawk steak was good. Not as good as the one we had two nights before at Vic and Anthony's, but it was good. The baked potato was good. The mac and cheese was not good at all. It had no flavor whatsoever. The asparagus was essentially raw upon arrival so we sent it back. When it was brought back it was so over cooked, it was limp. Didn't even eat it.   Back to our server, he was MIA for the majority of our time there. I had to flag other staff down for more tea. This person was kind enough to bring the tea box out and allow me to select. Finally our server showed up later on and refilled both hot and cold water. One time. That's it. Finally we were ready to leave and all of a sudden he became Mr. Friendly and started asking about our meal. A little too late.   Ambiance is nice. It overlooks old Vegas with all the lights.   We definitely wouldn't return. There's many dining options in Vegas that have similar price points. I'm sure there's one that's much better.",

    "text": "Took my girlfriend here for our Vegas dinner date night that we have every few months in and around Vegas.  I had been here before, a few years back but she had never been.  As you enter the restaurant, the bar is to your left and there are fun old time Vegas pictures as well as plenty of pictures of the owner and namesake - Oscar Goldman - former mayor of Las Vegas and all-around awesome guy in the hallway and on the walls. We had a reservation and I asked for a table by the windows to see the Fremont street experience from our table.  (The zipline tower now blocks most of your view but we had the best table we could have in order to see Fremont street).  Table setting and the overall vibe in Oscars is so elegant and old-school Vegas with the jazz and crooner style music playing.  We love this kinda vibe! Our waiter was Bobby.  This guy...   is awesome.  He has worked there since it opened and had some great stories to share about many of the people named on the menu.  His accent was great and I could totally imagine him low-key working for the mob back in the day.  We were unsure of a wine to choose and just let him decide for us.  Brought us out a perfect Riesling to complement our order.  Food....   They didn't have some of the items I used to love on the menu anymore, but the food was fantastic nonetheless.  For our starter, I tried the meatballs which were seasoned and tasty and she had the Brussels sprouts.  I normally hate these but I had a few bites and I would actually eat these. For our mains, she ordered the New York strip, Oscar's style (bearnaise sauce, lump crab and asparagus).  For some reason beyond my understanding, I was compelled to order the bone-in ribeye, covered in their Maytag bleu cheese sauce.   This monster was placed in front of me and I didn't even know how to properly deal with the size!  I just went kamikaze style and torn into it.  By the time we were both done, I still had half of this steak left and no way to keep the rest as we had planned the dinner early with people watching and gambling on Fremont just after.  It was a sad choice to have to make, but my busting waistline on my pants made it a slightly easier decision to leave it there. Overall summary...   Amazing wait service.  Bobby was incredible and fun.  Drinks were great and the food was all huge and delicious.  Decor and the old-school vibe of this place is so much fun and takes you back to the good ol' days of Vegas. As a side note, mostly aimed at bros and millennials...    I saw so many people come in while we were there, wearing baseball hats, t-shirts and even board shorts and flip-flops.  Come on man, if you are taking your girl out for a nice dinner, have some class and put on a collared shirt and some pants.  Make it a nice event that she will remember.",

    "text": "I had Oscar's on my list for some time now.  I decided to pair dinner here with the Mob Story show at the Plaza for after dinner.  I have eaten in this room once before many,  many years ago when it was the Center Stage restaurant.  It used to have a better view down Fremont Street than it does now.  The landing area for Slotzilla at the end of Fremont Street pretty much blocks the view of what was a great one of the canopy especially after dark.  After seating, waiters were there to bring water and take my order for iced tea.  They were attentive then and throughout the entire meal.  I had a few questions of my server and he told me of the bullseye steak that was available but not on the menu.  I ordered the corn and crab bisque to start, the bullseye steak--blue--and an order of steak fries.  I was soon brought a basket of onion bread and some soft, sweet butter.  I had time to take in the limited view and my bisque was brought.  It was lukewarm.  It had fresh, roasted sweet corn and a couple of pieces of crab.  It was a thick bisque from cheese and thickening agent.  It was OK.  The steak was tender and it was blue.  Hooray for a chef that will do this and not be afraid of the customer wishing it was cooked more.  However, during my time there, two meat dishes were returned to the kitchen from other tables for cooking issues.  I ordered the blue cheese sauce and asked for it to be on the side so I could decide on the amount to put on my steak.  The steak fries were tossed with parmesan and parsley.  They were quite good.  For dessert, I ordered the deep dish chocolate chip cookie supposedly Goodman's favorite.  The server warned me that it would take about 15 minutes which was OK with me.  The cookie is very hot.  Take heed!  Take your time with eating this cookie and do so carefully unless you want 2nd degree burns of the mouth.  It is good.  There is a $2 charge for the a la mode.  The restaurant is elegant.  Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.  The view--not what it used to be.  The meal was OK but there are so many steakhouses and in my area of town that can match this that there's no reason to come here and go through the hassle of getting your parking ticket validated to get out of the garage.  Your are in effect paying Strip prices for a downtown property.  The place is OK.",

We went for the bacon appetizer first. It was delicious but I'll say the syrup is a game changer. It's like mixing Sunday morning brunch and steak dinner all in one. Our main course were classic steak orders but the ala cart  sides were difficult to sort through! Must order sides.. Mac and cheese!! & Brussels sprouts. Both were totally worth it!   We went with a cheesecake for dessert and it was to die for! No reservations were made for our Tuesday evening dinner, just stopped in and got to enjoy a wonderful view of Hotel California and Fremont Street!",

We stopped at the bar prior to our 5:30 reservations and enjoyed some delicious/strong drinks with happy hour prices (try the Sazeriac it's great). Our waiter was Frank who was really wonderful and attended to every detail, including getting a black napkin vs. the regular white for our friend who had black pants on (Frank said he didn't want any possibility of lint getting on his pants that's classy). Frank was very conscientious of our show time and kept dinner moving and a nice but not rushed pace. I ordered the lobster bisque which was wonderful even without large pieces of lobster in it. The rest of the table had Caesar's salad and wedge salad both reported them to be good not great. I had the blackened salmon and it was spectacular, well cooked and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had the small prime rib which was amazing, our friends had the small filet which was cooked perfectly and the spice rubbed flank steak which was stuffed with garlic and massive. We all shared asparagus (nicely cooked), potato wedges (great only wish there were more sweet potatoes) and the corn brulee which was the best of the sides for sure. Frank recommended cheesecake for dessert and it did not disappoint (it was flown in from NY). We left at exactly 7pm which was perfect and we were to our show in perfect time.  This is a place I will be back to for sure.",

We were seated almost immediately (7 p.m. reservations), and the service was very good. Lobster bisque was excellent, steak was done as ordered (medium rare), sides were fine. The only negative comment was that the steak and sides (except for the bisque) were very... well, plain. They were not bad, just uninspired. I can forgive this, though, because the service and overall experience was otherwise top notch and so long as my steak comes as ordered and and is tender - which it was.  We did not really get to experience the \"broads\"; one came to our table towards the end of the evening starting light conversation; they do add some bling and \"eye candy\" appeal, I suppose, but was not what we were after. Bottom line, the food was good, service excellent. Would definitely return!",

The place was about half full and there were plenty of windows available. The waiter was borderline rude and annoyed with us because our friends are from out of town and were late from getting lost. I would get it if the place was packed and they needed to turnover tables. The busser brought dessert before we ordered and did not understand English when we tried to say we didn't order it. Isn't basic English necessary to perform the job duties? I would hate to get dessert that had been sitting in front of someone else. Yuck. The food was mediocre. I had skirt steak, which had huge cloves of garlic embedded somehow. I liked it alright. The potatoes were ice cold. Husband had filet. Said it was OK. Friends said the prime rib and fish were great. But neither ate more than a few bites. I think for the food and service it was ridiculously overpriced. $196 before tip for 4 dinners, no wine. Sorry Oscar, I think you need new management. I don't see this place lasting long. The caliber of Fremont street people won't spend that and locals won't return. As usual I would have preferrred Outback. That's rather sad. Return? NO WAY!",

After perusing the extensive wine list at the bar, we were lucky to be escorted into the main dining area which resembled a glass dome atrium which allowed diners to see everything on Main Street and feel as though we were dining at the top of skyscraper.  While basking in the ethereal beauty of the dome, we all remained puzzled as to the restaurant's gregarious tagline, \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\", which I am not ashamed to admit was another factor in getting us to eat at this intriguing establishment.  Thinking that the tagline simply referred to the finer things in life, we were taken by surprise when a tipsy showgirl sashayed on over to our table, whose bosoms and lips had been artificially enhanced so much that she seemed in constant danger of falling over.  Utterly pleased with how Oscar's had thusfar come through with its promise of broads, we bravely tackled the menu so as to experience the beef and booze.  After deciding on a bottle of Spanish Tempranillo, we decided to order a melange of dishes for the table to share.  As difficult as it was to choose, we decided to order the Spilotro-Style Flat Iron steak, the Alaskan King crab legs, the Cedar Plank Blackened salmon, a few orders of the Cardini's Two-Bit Caesar salad, Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese, Steamed Asparagus and Broccoli, and Ralph's Smashed potatoes.  The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare state, as requested, and came brimming with delicious bits of barely cooked garlic, which might turn off your average garlic consumer, but not me, I reveled in its fiery goodness. The crab legs were moist and fresh, and we were tempted to order another serving because we went through the first one so quickly.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and we all watched it tenderly flake onto our forks, each bite brimming with its natural juices. Not being a huge fan of mac & cheese, I was prepared to have little opinion of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the pasta was not swimming in a cheese sauce, but had been appropriately baked with cheese and cream, so that the pasta had actually taken on some of the delicate cheese flavors, especially something that reminded me of a smokey gouda... c'est si bon!  The broccoli and asparagus were barely steamed (perhaps blanched?) which is exactly how they should be served, and acted as healthy palate cleansers.  Did I forget to mention the Tempranillo?  It was divine.  Each sip reminiscent of lazy, sunny days spent in the spanish countryside... not too tannic, not too acidic, and definitely not too fruity. We finished off our feast with espresso,cappuccinos and a tiramisu for the table to share.  The coffee was exquisite and balanced the delicate richness of the house-made tiramisu.  Overall, my colleagues and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would return in a heartbeat.  Bravo, Oscar!",

Our server Iggy, was perfect in his demeanor and presentation. The GM Perry checked in. Could not have asked for more.2. The food was very good, Crab starter was well prepared and was done Maryland style with nice large pieces of creab (compared to the more ususal patty style). The chopped salad was touted as being unique and special and it was. My companion had the filet done oscar style and it was prepared perfectly. I had the Flatirn steak and it was absolutely delicious. (although it has a bit of spicy heat. perfect for me but I understand others are more sensitive to this). We tried several good desserts and the chocolate mouse cake was the favorite!",

The prices are normal for Vegas so if you are looking for a $15 filet mignon, go visit Kansas, but you're not going to find a decent one in Vegas for less than $35-$40, and most places on the Strip start them out at $45-$50 so Oscar's is not out of line.  Would like to see better wines by the glass, but that was the only thing I would change...and the wines they did have by the glass were NOT overpriced as others have said, again, if you want a $5 glass of wine, stick to the poker bars, not a high-end steakhouse.  We will definitely be back.",

We were offered our seat 15 minutes before our reservation time.  We were seated, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  Our party of four ordered appetizers, steak, and chicken.  Every one of us thought the food was amazing.  It was a little expensive, but I would eat there again and pay the asking price for food that great.  Three out of the four of us had dessert, and everyone agreed the dessert was amazing as well.",

He discussed with us the different pronunciations of tiramisu based on where you live in Italy. The manager Monty was incredibly accommodating and escorted us to an area where we could enjoy some of their fabulous coffee and a cigarette after the meal. The red pepper roumelade with the crab cakes was amazing. Bone in ribeye was fabulous. Our new puppy border collie Higgs got to enjoy the bone for a solid 4 hours, which they wrapped up for me, and passed out. I imagine the marrow was as incredible delicious as how perfectly medium rare it was. He is spoiled. As a local it was nice to have a good relaxing meal with my dad on his birthday. Great experience, great food. Highly recommend for locals. They should consider a local discount and advertise it, would bring in a ton more business, especially on weekday nights.",

    "text": "My wife and I were really looking forward to trying a nice steakhouse downtown.  Sadly, we were most disappointed.  First, we were seated next door at Simpatico because the dome at Oscar's was temporarily closed due to strong winds (understandable).  After we were seated, we waited 20 minutes for the waiter to take our orders.  Our waiter failed to inform us of the daily fresh catch of the day and bone-in ribeye, which we heard about only from a waiter from the adjacent table.  We started with the complementary onion bread, which although warm, did not taste particularly fresh.  I next had the chopped vegetable salad.  While the vegetables tasted fresh, the peppercorn dressing had minimal flavor.  I requested more dressing on the side, which I received after the third request.  Adding extra dressing only added more bland taste.  My wife and I both ordered the filet, her's an 8 oz. medium and mine a 12 oz. medium rare.  Her steak came out medium-well to well, and mine medium to medium-well.  While she was too hungry to wait for another steak, I requested a re-do.  Another 20 minutes later, I received the smaller 8 oz. steak done cold-rare in the center; I'm really not into steak carpaccio!  Finally, another 20 minutes later, I received the correctly cooked 12 oz. medium-rare.  Although cooked appropriately with the requested peppercorn sauce and mushrooms, the steak had very little flavor.  As for side dishes, we ordered their versions of creamed spinach and creamed corn.  The spinach was over-cooked and limp, and the cream sauce again had no flavor.  The creamed corn was better - probably the highlight of the meal.  I would have expected the manager to stop by our table for our troubles, but he seemed too busy walking back and forth to other tables.  At least a complementary desert or a simple \"I'm sorry\" would have been appreciated.  Overall, particularly for the price, the food was disappointedly flavorless and the service was just plain poor.  We will not be returning.",

    "text": "I will recommend Oscars to my enemies only.  Made 7pm reservations and showed up at 630pm on Christmas day 2011.  Checked in when I arrived and the hostess seated my party of 8 at the bar while we waited.  At 715 pm I checked on the status of our table and the hostess, the same hostess, didn't remember me and this time did not have my name on the list and she looked at me narrowly and spoke with perfect sarcasm.  Very frustrated we spoke with the manager Ulysiss and he found our reservation.  At 8:30pm we sat.  When 3 of the 4 filets we ordered arrived one was thoroughly burnt and the other three were bleeding liked they'd just been killed.  All 4 were ordered medium well.  The pork chop was cooked on the outside and the inside was more than raw and the halibut was completely uncooked on the inside.  The food was sent back and in the mean time the waiter refilled our water when the lid fell off the top of his pitcher and got half the table wet and the water dripped onto the seats and we had wet butts.  The waiter laughed it off and as we complained he blamed his service on the fact that the restaurant was new.  The waiter told us that the chef was not drunk and that is why the food wasn't normally good.  Staff was unprofessional and did not care.  While we were waiting a poor guy at the table next to us moved in his chair when the back two legs on the chair broke and he went crashing to the floor.  The staff was laughing and instead of helping the man up they chose to walk away in the other direction.  The food came back and we found that instead of providing new cuts of what we ordered they cut our old portions into smaller portions and recooked them.  Also, when I ordered a long island iced tea the waitress from another area overheard me ordering and she challenged me to a drink off which I did not oblige.  I will be making extremely bad recommendations to my friends and visitors to Las Vegas of my experience and discourage anybody from going here.  Please do not support this restaurant.",

    "text": "So the ambiance is wonderful and the staff is great! The drinks are decent. Starting off we had the shrimp cocktail. The cocktail sauce was nice and spicy- you can tell they made it rather than it coming from a jar. The shrimp were very large, more like prawns! They were slightly waterlogged, but still good. The next was a Cesar salad. Now, I love traditional Cesar salads with the anchovies and raw egg- I think it was delicious. My husband on the other hand has never had a real/traditional Cesar salad and said he prefers the Kraft Cesar dressing to the one Oscars served. So to each their own with that. This is when the dinner took a turn for the worst. We ordered the halibut with cauliflower puree and sauteed spinach. The spinach was good- great seasoning. The fish was hard, not the least bit flaky and at one point I needed my knife to cut off a bite size piece. There was no seasoning at all. Also there was virtually no puree, and what little was there was tasteless. Seriously- the fish was horrible, red lobster is ten times better! We were also disappointed in the \"caramelized roasted\" Brussels sprouts. There was zero caramelization, the sprouts were underdone, woody and steamed, totally changing the flavor- also there was pretty much no seasoning. Lastly we got the creme brulee for dessert. The sugar crust was done correctly but that was it. The custard was clotted and had the consistency of ricotta cheese- super unappetizing. All and all the kind staff and beautifully decorated restaurant cannot make up for the lack of care in the food. It's at best a mediocre meal, and not worthy of it's \"steakhouse\" title and prices.",

This dining experience was certainly a highlight of our trip. The food was phenomenal. The BEST artichoke appetizer any of us had ever tasted - hands down! Also, the rest of the items ordered did not fail- it was all amazing.  However, the True highlight of the evening was our server, Nick. He had all the right suggestions, in all the right places. Additionally,  he shared with us over his experience of over 40-years of Vegas history and his care for our dining experience was refreshing and delightful. Words can't describe the fun, passion and care that went into the food, service and atmosphere. I look forward to my return to Vegas with my family to visit Oscar's...to see Nick, hear more of his stories and enjoy the food and fun. THANK YOU!!!",

    "text": "The good: 1. Amazing happy hour at the bar: 50% off the beer! Can't beat a $3 blue moon! Awesome price 2. The crab cakes were amazing. Huge chunks of crab meat in the perfect ratio of meat to filler. The outside was also perfectly crispy with the right amount of crunch 3. You MUST, and I repeat, you MUST order the Chocolate Mousse for dessert. It was best thing I ate all night. Layers of fluffy clouds of mousse and the bottom layer had a rich rum flavor? or was it espresso? I could not pin it down, but it kept drawing my spoon back for more and more bites until I was scraping the plate clean. 4. The onion dinner bread was different and delicious. The service we had was not that great and our dinner bread did not come to the table until after our appetizers were served and then cleared. But the bread was great- warm with cheese baked on top. I can always tell a good restaurant by their dinner bread and this was pretty good.  The Mediocre:  Chopped salad: The salad already came with pepper on it and there was so much of it that it just overwhelmed my whole palate. The candied pecans seemed out of place. When I would actually bite into one, it just seemed strange and it did not go well with the rest of the flavor profile. The onion strings on top were stale. If they were crunchier, it would have been enough texture to replace the candied pecans.   To pass: 1. Sally's New York Strip: sorry to say that you should pass on this steak even though this is a steak house. The steak was cooked perfectly- good grill marks and perfectly charred, but there was no flavor! It lacked seasoning and salt. Sorry to say that I wish I had steak sauce but I didn't want to be rude and ask for it. Also the meat was a little tough. Was not tender like I would expect from a higher end steakhouse.  2. The cheesecake- not good. Too dense. You're better off going to the cheesecake factory if you're craving cheesecake.",

This was my second visit to Oscar's and in both cases the service was extremely slow - the servers are nice, but I think they need more than (2) in the bar area on a busy night and more than one on a slow night.  The charcuterie plate was great and when ordered for (2) was ample for (4) people.  From there it went down hill.  The three meatball appetizer came out cold in the middle and the Ahi Tuna appetizer came with the wasabi and ginger, but absolutely no soy or ponzu sauce for dipping.  So I ask you, why put wasabi paste on my plate, if you're not going to give me either sauces for dipping?  The server got the drink orders wrong and thought it was odd that we would want bread to actually come with a charcuterie plate...  My martini glass had leftover soap residue, which tainted the a very simple Kettle One, straight up with a twist :-(  As a local, I know I will return as I do enjoy some of the new spots popping up downtown and I can only hope that Oscar's will strive to become a better place to eat vs. just drink.",

    "text": "This is a throwback to old school Vegas. \"Beef, Booze and Broads\" (tag line) INDEED!  While the food is NOT perfect, the service certainly was. I'm a big fan for great service; even if food may lack quality or character. The view stunning, the atmosphere fun and comfy and the music was a good throwback to old school Vegas lounge acts. We came during Happy Hour and the specials were a pleasant surprise. Half off certain cocktails and appetizers. I only wished they would have told us when Happy Hour was over, as the price in drinks changed quite a bit.  Appetizers were a bit \"off\" as well: shrimp cocktail & calamari def were frozen and not \"fresh\", but prepared and served well. We had the strip steak at $48.00 and it was cooked and tasted to perfection. All in all, I would come back again and steer clear of any fish on the menu as I don't think they have fresh fare in that department. The steaks, atmosphere and friendly service are worth a trip though if you are in downtown (Fremont) Vegas. Ill be back.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this steak house since it opened and I travel to Vegas frequently to play poker. Every trip out of town and special events in town, I always love a good steak...I hoped for a 5 star time...but settled for 3. The ambiance in the bar area aims for an old school Vegas/ speakeasy vibe to it...and it hits the mark...I could picture this place as being back in the day...although the lights would be a bit bright for Mr Sinatra's taste I would guess :-) I sat at the bar and interaction with the bartender was minimal...did his job,nothing bad or great to set him apart. I ordered the Steak Au Poivre...the ny strip was cooked to order...and quality wise...ok...average for the price. What did stand out was the Au Poivre sauce was almost more BBQ than peppery. Maybe the chef didn't stir it and the pepper settled to the bottom before he ladelled it...I don't know. It didn't ruin the meal, but it was not what it could have been. The Potato Croquettes, on the other hand, were perfectly done. I recommend that as your side for any meal in the place. What finished off the experience for me was the floor manager. she came by and asked how the meal was. I commented on the positives and then told her about the Au Poivre sauce...to which her reply was ,\"Oh, are you a food critic?\" Perhaps her aim was not to be condescending...I would hope that's the case...but my immeadiate thought was \"Isn't every customer of yours evaluating their meal?\"...and as someone who has run front of the house in restaurants for 20 years...that was the wrong way to interact with a guest. So...overall...an ok steak house...but I left with a bad taste in my mouth...whether it was the sauce or the manager, i'm not quite sure.",

He sure likes bigger parties as he makes you feel like a nuisance. It took 10mins & 2 reminders that we want the wine & cocktail list. He doesn't let you finish what you're saying & walks away. He doesn't even pack your leftovers.  Gave you boxes & bag to pack them yourself. For this price, that should be a no brainer. Too bad coz food was great. We come to town at least 2x a year for trade show. Will come back but will definitely not sit at Ray 's tables.",

    "text": "Before I give you my honest feedback after visiting Oscar's for the first time, I want you to know I am a local; I am a supporter of all things downtown; and I am an avid supporter of Oscar and Carolyn both. But this restaurant was a total and complete miss for us.  Bread: with onions? Onions?? Awful. Chopped salad: very nice flavors, embarrassingly small portion. Onion soup: nicely presented, but weird taste. Filet mignon: ordered medium, got well, very dry inside. Not offered or served with any sauces at all, like peppercorn as an example. New York: portion was very generous, also overcooked, taste was very boring. No marinade, no flavor, and again, no sauce. Sides: does every side have to have bread crumbs? Couldn't taste the difference between macaroni and cheese and corn, because both are drowning in bread crumbs. Baked potato was very dry, seemed like sitting a very long time. Tiramisu: not bad, not great. Service: waited a long time to be greeted even though when we arrived, only 3-4 tables. Busser was excellent, seemed like he cared much more than server. But all small details missing: drinks not filled very quickly; no one decrumbed table until time for dessert even though we needed it; not much care to arrange silverware between courses, etc.  ALSO: when I made the reservation, I stated that it was our anniversary. But it was never even mentioned or acknowledged by the server, the maitre d', the manager, no one. Not a single sound about it.  We eat out every single night, and really hoped for a great experience. We really know the restaurant scene in Las Vegas, and know what to expect at different price points. But unfortunately, this restaurant falls FAR short, even had it been at a lesser price point.  Honestly, we were very disappointed, especially as this was a special occasion for us.",

The view of downtown is amazing from the restaurant--although it is a bummer they have that new zip line that blocks a good portion (not the restaurant's fault by any means).  I always get the filet mignon butterflied well done and they do it perfectly!  The garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus are delicious sides as well.  The dinners here are just so so good. My husband ordered the salmon and I don't even like fish but it looked delicious as well.   The only thing I don't care for is the bread--it has scallions and stuff inside it and I'd rather have plain bread.  If you go to Vegas this place is worth eating at.",

I had the Caesar salad which was nothing fancy, but just right. The bisque was flawless, just flavorful spoonful after flavorful spoonful.  The highlight is clearly the steak. To put it lightly: I've eaten a lot of steaks in my day. This was the best.   I was there over a month ago and had the filet. and I'm not exaggerating when I say my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Just an incredibly tender piece of beef that could literally be cut with a fork. And it was prepared exactly how it should be: a nice charred crust, a little salt, and a little pepper. Nothing else. No crazy nonsense. No BS sauce. Just delicious meat.   I don't know when the next time I'll get to Vegas is. But if the Gods are good, they will make sure Oscar's is still around. I have recommended it to all my friends, and will undoubtedly visit multiple times during my next trip.   Oh and the mac and cheese is amazing too.",

Ami \"the broad\" was very nice and knowledgable. The jazz trio in the bar sounded great. The bar decor was very tastefully decorated. One of the people we were with lost their cell phone in the booth and we got it back the next day. They knew it belonged to us by our reservation. We all were very impressed with Oscar's.

It is a pretty room, circular so that most everyone has a decent view.  From the moment we were seated, our server, Frankie, was attentive but not pushy, and his helper was also.  We told him that we weren't in a hurry and didn't want to be rushed, and the timing on the entire meal was just about perfect.  Our water glasses were refilled regularly, without asking, Frankie was friendly and charming and his attitude just added to the pleasantness of the evening.  We all were very pleased with our food - the onion bread was great (I loved the lobster bisque), and our steaks were done perfectly.  The waiters were dressed in crisp black and white striped shirts and black ties, and looked great!  We saw some very attractive young women who were seating customers, but no-one we would call a \"broad\".  That was kind of disappointing - we wanted to see the \"broads\".  Pictures on the walls were the same pictures covering the walls of Oscar's office and hallway while he was Mayor, and very interesting, if you haven't seen them before!  It was nice having live music during dinner - a pianist in the bar area, so the music was soft enough in the dining room to have uninterrupted conversation.  Overall, we enjoyed the whole experience, and are looking forward to our next visit.",

The view from the restaurant is amazing (inside and out) I had the french onion soup, absolutely amazing. And the chicken with artichoke and mashed potatoes entree, again amazing. The only thing that would have cost this restaurant a star was my broccoli side, unfortunately it came out cold (very cold) for being steamed broccoli.  Sadly I am rating this on our groups experience. We had a party of 8. everything went well from the start. Drinks, calamari (perfectly fried not greasy at all), and salads and my soup. Out of 7 salads one came out with a wrong dressing, not a big deal the salad was eaten anyways. It when the entrees came out that the whole dinner went downhill. Out of 8 entrees only 4 came out right. 2 of the guests who had each ordered the dinner special of the 22oz ribeye were presented with a prime rib, one guested ordered a filet mignon well done with a butterfly cut, received her filet but since it wasn't butterflied it was still very red in the center. Another guests prime rib topped with sauteed mushrooms came out with the mushrooms cold. (not to mention about 2 other orders of broccoli and 1 asparagus order also coming out cold)  The manager was quickly at our table apologizing and ensuring the food would be recooked...Which it was. First came out the new orders of broccoli and asparagus, so the guests ate just the veggies while the waited for the meat not wanting the broccoli to get cold a second time. Since a 22oz ribeye and the filet are rather big pieces of meat they took a long time to be brought up to the correct temperatures, the guests who were waiting (While the rest of us ate) were presented with a shrimp cocktail. A nice gesture but after appetizers and salads those who even liked shrimp were getting full and just wanted their meal.   Finally the food came back out 2 beautiful ribeyes (Which tastes amazing too). Unfortunately again the filet came out butterflied cut but was STILL very red in the center, not acceptable after waiting 30+ minutes for it to be made a second time. We were offered desserts on the house but for those who ate we were all too full and the other half of the group just wanted to get out of the restaurant. We had asked for the check to be split 3 ways, again many problems (which I understand I am a server and splitting checks is a pain but not impossible!)  Finally after about another 20 minutes our checks were figured out and we could go.  I would go back to this restaurant again just maybe not in as large as a group.",

Prime rib was good, but it was a very fatty cut of meat, more fatty than other prime rib steaks I've had at other steakhouses. Creamed spinach was not very good. Skipped dessert. We got there late and the staff was ok but they seemed like they wanted to rush us out of there and go home as we were one of the last tables to be seated for the evening..  View was nice but we wont be back and will not recommend.",

    "text": "Oscar's opened several years ago with a good helping of razzle, dazzle and sizzle. When entering the restaurant, the experience was much like entering a different era, politically incorrect and refreshing amidst the landscape of generic dining establishments, think Applebee's and TGI Friday's. But unfortunately, Oscar's sizzle has now been reduced to a mere fizzle - you know, the way January 2nd feels like.... The reception was less than stellar - do not dare to arrive 5 minutes before your planned reservation time unless you don't mind having to wait the extra 5 minutes anyway because these folks are clock-watchers. The view of Fremont Street was been permanently obstructed by this ridiculous Zipline monstrosity but who could fault the restaurant for that? The service was great, luckily those standards have not relaxed, but the food was mediocre at best. The Prime rib was lackluster, lacking in taste and colder than expected for a medium cut although medium rare was ordered. Mayor Carolyn, please stop by and sample the cut named after you - I would suspect you would have preferred to order the chicken dinner instead. The Ahi tuna was peppercorn encrusted and that's about all I tasted - Peppercorns - a hint of the flavor of tuna was not to be found. The side dish of asparagus was room temperature, ho-hum. But the biggest disappointment was the obvious lack of \"broads\" not that they really would have made the dining experience any more enjoyable, but hey! That's what is advertised and a good reason to go there, or so I thought. In summary, beef not so great, Booze okay, but isn't it everywhere else?, and Broads, well not around when we were there. I guess they need a day off too. But as a whole the restaurant itself has taken a day off. O how I long for the good ol' days of sizzle!",

The first time I dined at Oscars, both Oscar and Carolyn Goodman were there, but not last night.  As a local of Las Vegas,  I really like the old Vegas feel at the Plaza with a great restaurant to enjoy.",

    "text": "We tried Oscar's on a Thursday night, with reservations for 7:00.  We were seated promptly at the best table in the house, looking right down the tunnel of the Fremont Street Experience.  We were celebrating our guests 49th Anniversary and wanted to try Oscar's.  The waiter was extremely helpful and friendly, and attentive.  We began with the seafood appetizer which was absolutely the best seafood appetizer we had ever had anywhere.  Oysters, mussels, shrimp, lobster and king crab legs.  All tasted extremely fresh and there sure was a lot to eat.  Two people could order just the seafood appetizer and leave happy and stuffed.  The pork chop was prepared perfectly and the skirt steak was amazing - charred on the outside and medium rare in the center and seasoned to perfection.  A thin piece like that is very difficult to prepare properly and this one was excellent.  We ordered a couple of bottles of wine from the ample wine list and were not disappointed.  To sum up our experience, I'll just say that while we were at the table, we made reservations for the following night and had an equally pleasant experience.  Tried some other items from the menu (the halibut was top-of-the-line).  The Caesar salad was right-on, with just the right hint of saltiness from the anchovies without being \"fishy\" at all.  Oscar's has only been open for about seven weeks, so there are probably some kinks to be straightened out.  Hopefully, the negative review someone else posted won't scare you away.  This is a very good steak house, and if you're a fan, you might just run into Oscar himself.  The only disappointment I had was that Oscar wasn't there either of the two nights, but that just means I'll have to go back again.",

Sarah Frances Johnston (and her husband, Sean Smith) were the two people behind the debacle that was LV Air last year, and bilked a number of businesses (and their employees) out of thousands of dollars... but now she's performing regularly there!  As champions of business and tourism in Las Vegas, you'd think that people who took such shady actions wouldn't be rewarded with ongoing employment there.  I'd love to give the place a fair try, but my loyalty to the businesses of Las Vegas makes me have to pass.",

The location is in the Plaza Hotel & Casino in the revitalized downtown area. From the outside, the large glass-walled dining room looks as though it might be old-style Vegas at its worst, but from the inside it's actually quite nice. We've been there twice. The first time the service was excellent, the second time it was very good. The food is whimsically described on the menu, but well prepared. In short, I thought this might just be a novelty place and instead found somewhere to which I'll enjoy returning.",

Our server did not come back to see how our food was, we had to flag him down after more than 10 minutes to get Horseradish sauce.  Never asked if we wanted dessert or after dinner drinks.  Just cleared and handed us the check.  We then went to have a drink at the bar and visit, however after sitting there for more than five minutes with the bartender ignoring us, we left.  Not a place I would bother going again, there are many more wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas save some money find somewhere else.",

They have a great deal on the sides, 3 sides for the price of 2.  We ordered the mac n' cheese (we added lobster for only $10), mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  All were done very nicely.  For dessert, we got the creme brulee and the turtle lava cake.  Both very good.  Very good place and a cool atmosphere.  Would definitely come back to try the NY strip.",

I read the yelp reviews and was ready for some bad service and some bad food. My friend called ahead and had reassurances that the bad reviews were just opening problems.  I must say, I was happy we went here.  The ambience was nice. Upscale old school feel to the place. Not modern. Being in downtown vegas the clientele seemed more of the older midwest, southern crowd.    Was it the best steak i've had? No.  Was it good because I had really low expectations? Probably Was it enhanced by the fact that we'd been drinking for a couple hours prior? Likely  The bread is awesome! I can't tell you how much of that stuff i ate. The menu was a bit limited. We got the crabcakes which were excellent (not alot of breading).  Also tried the lobster bisque which was pretty good (alot of places make it too salty but this was just right)  Had the new york strip which was cooked just right with a nice char on the outside. Another member of our party had the prime rib which I have to say was excellent!  Would come back but there are so many other great places to eat in vegas I probably won't. But I would still recommend you give this place a try",

The view is OK given you look over a bunch of kiosks and half naked girls pushing slushie drinks that frankly look a little trashy.  After all , are I not sitting in an upscale restaurant owned by the previous mayor of Las Vegas?  Confusing, yes. The bar is nice and roomy, however dining room jammed a little.  Menu: Cute and named after Mobsters so its a step away from culinary standards.  I think ONLY McDonalds has silly names for food. A little trendy and silly for a serious restaurant.  Did I say serious. I ordered the fish and it tasted very ammonia old like even 8 lemons are not going to help this. My date ordered a steak, which wasn't anything special, but most certainly beef.  Creme Brule: Had better at a buffet.  This is not a serious restaurant, so know that if you go here.  However off their own website     \"addition to great food, Oscar's Beef * Booze * Broads pairs a great meal with the unique opportunity to have one of Oscar's \"Broads\" visit with customers during dinner. These attractive women will be dinner companions who can discuss subjects such as politics, sports, wine, Las Vegas history or things to do downtown or on the Strip. When not dining with customers, they will roam the Downtown Las Vegas restaurant as hostesses, adding to the glamorous and uniquely Vegas style of Oscar's\"  Women are not \"Broads\" and when I saw this form of what borders on what looks like some weak form of prostitution I don't even think this restaurant should be allowed to operate.  If you have to lure patrons into your restaurant for the women NOT the food your a zero!  Cannot recommend this place.",

Sides dishes were so so, we had the creamed spinach, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes and corn gratin.  The service was good, however; the staff is not refined for the prices that they charge. I did not expect a lot since this is downtown and the clientele show up wearing t-shirts and shorts.  The overall value was OK, the prices were just a little under strip pricing.   For a about 20 or so more dollars per person I will recommend STK, Joes Stone Crab, Capital Grill or Del Frisco for great drinks, food and service.",

The steaks were well seasoned and a great amount for the price.  The corn was sweet and buttery and a nice compliment to the steak.  We also ordered 2 glasses of red wine. I had a pinot noir and my husband had a merlot. Both wines were good quality. The wine section by the glass is a little small.  And last but not least was our server Brad who is a True master at what he does. He gave the perfect amount of attention while we were eating and then chatted us up at the end of our meal, which we liked.   If you are looking for a good steak in Vegas Oscars is a great choice for ambiance, food, and service",

A few of the items ordered were:  -The Italian Market appetizer, was ok, I wouldn't order again.  -Sister and I ordered the Spicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak, very flavorful, had a nice kick to it. The steak came w/a side of smashed potatoes which were just ok.  -Hubby ordered the Prime Rib which was huge and amazingly good!  -Brother in law ordered the Pork Chop which came with 2 pieces topped w/ mushrooms. Very big portion and yummy.  -Since each side is like $8-10 we ordered the 'Any Three Sides' for $20 and shared; Steamed Asparagus, Brussels Sprouts with caramelized onions & bacon and Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese. All were super delicious! Fave was the Mac & Cheese, omg in love.  All and all this place was great. Scott our server was very nice and attentive. At the end of our dinner he gave us a quick tour of the restaurant and their hidden back room. Very nice place, we will be sure to come back in the future.",

    "text": "This place is amazing - Let me say that as you walk into the casino, you don't realize that this great restaurant is right upstairs. Its an art-deco luxurious decor restaurant so dress nicely and take plenty of pictures. The bartenders are super knowledgeable and I recommend arriving early and having a few at the bar before dinner.   The food was delicious and perfectly seasoned. We were a table of four and we all ordered the bone in ribeye special. All were perfectly cooked and were well-rested before served. Everything was perfect with the meal and experience. The waiter was friendly.  My issue was that the server told us the wrong price for the ribeye. He said it was 55.00pp, we were charged 64.00pp. It was a dinner party and I didn't realize until the next day and was upset, thus the 3 stars. If it wasn't for this major price difference it would have been 4stars. The highest score I give.   I still recommend the place just make sure to double check the bill.",

    "text": "There is a lot of good food to be had in Las Vegas. You can pay a small fortune to eat at the table of a famous chef or, at the other end of the spectrum, you can eat well for a modest price at places like Lotus of Siam, arguably one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. I find the middle ground somewhat difficult to navigate.  I found myself in LV last night - just for the night. My husband told me to make a reservation at Oscar's, where he'd eaten a couple times. He said I'd like it. The experience was perfect from the moment we walked through the door.   We were seated at a window table overlooking Freemont Street. I loved the view. The waiter walked over, greeted us by name and introduced himself. His name was Bobby. He may have been the best waiter I've ever had and as often as I eat out, that's saying something. He offered recommendations, explained the preparation of various dishes and handled our requests flawlessly. He was funny, charming and dedicated. Since we were sharing several things he even sliced our steak into strips and set the plate between us so we could each take pieces without the hassle of cutting it up - a service that the kitchen charges $8 for. He told us he just considers it customer service and if they aren't slammed he does it.  We ate:  BREAD AND BUTTER: Not something I often mention but it was incredible! Hot and soft and flavorful with onion and delicious whipped butter. We ate two baskets of it! Well, truthfully we brought one home.  CORN AND CRAB BISQUE: Absolutely delicious. It was crazy hot so take care with the first bite. Also, crab isn't nearly as good as lobster in a bisque. SURF AND TURF: Ribeye was cooked to perfection. We barely needed a knife to cut it. Shrimp was stuffed with crab cakes and served in a light flavorful sauce. I ate more of the steak and my husband ate more of the shrimp. We were both very happy. CORN BRULEE: I would eat this every night! They roast sweet corn, cut it off the cob and bake it with a cream sauce and parmesan. My mouth is watering just writing about it. MAC & CHEESE: Very good. Nothing unique but baked in a cast iron dish. Yummy. BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Also really good. I'm not raving about these sides because they were great but that corn...  Start to finish we had an incredible time. The food, setting and service were all five star. If you read this review and decide to go to Oscar's ask for Bobby. You won't be sorry. He really was the best waiter I've ever had.",

    "text": "What a great dinner. I called and got a same day reservation when I called I requested a table with a view as expected the hostess said it's based on what's available at the time. We arrived for our reservation and we got sat at a tiny table that was very awkward. A few min after we got sat another couple got sat at a much nicer table ( maybe they requested it too ? ) I looked around and noticed there was another table available that would much more comfortable to sit at. In the mean time we checked in on yelp and got our free glass on wine that was surprisingly good.  We even ordered a refill. With the wine on the table and the bread basket there was only space left for one entree each. We ordered one entree each and 4 sides so I decided to get up and ask to move to the much better table that was still available. They were very accommodating and very understanding why we wanted to move. Even or waiter agreed the first table we were sat at was awkward. Everything we ordered was delicious. The filet was melt in your mouth good. The osso buco was good but compared to the filet it fell a little flat.  We had the thick cut bacon 1 piece was enough for 2 it was delicious but heavy. We had the cream corn the Brussel sprouts ( amazing ) and the asparagus ( only thing I wouldn't order again). We had a great dining experience and ended out meal with some grappa that was on the house for a funny inconvenience that happened during dinner.  I would give 5 stars for food and service. Only reason why I'm giving 4 is because of where we were sat in the beginning of the night. Unfortunately the view wasn't great because of the slotzilla platform but the ambience, food and service more than make up for it.",

I would have given 5 stars, but we had a couple of hick ups getting to our overall satisfaction.  Scott took great care of us.

The view does not disappoint being that it's at the end of Freemont St and the entire roof is a glass dome giving you a beautiful view of downtown. The staff adds to the elegance of the restaurant and I was pleased with the different options the menu offers. I had the roasted chicken with artichokes and my boyfriend got the filet. The food was good but lacked a little flavor however the onion strings were delicious, the side dishes are definitely portioned for sharing.   With the coupon we saved about $22.. Not too shabby!",

    "text": "Oscars is a little hidden gem in the heart of downtown Las Vegas. Most people wouldn't think twice of going to this restaurant because it's location. As a tourist, you wouldn't really know how to find this place. It is situated in a small local casino, The Plaza. I assume it's populated mainly with locals.  I dined here upon my cousin's recommendation, who's a Vegas local, and a True foodie.   Food: incredible! You must try the rib eye! It was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The portion size is HUGE! I've never had such a large sized rib eye for that price. My cousin and I shared the plate and it was more than enough for the two of us. We also ordered the fried calamari, shrimp cocktail, and the chopped salad. The shrimp cocktail was probably my favorite. It's 4 pieces of jumbo sized shrimp that is super fresh! The chocolate cake was damn delicious and again, they don't skimp on the portion. It's a large slice with a chocolate/ cream sauce on the side with two scoops  vanilla ice cream   Ambiance: Gorgeous! The center glass chandelier really sets a romantic and modern vibe. The first thing you notice as you walk into the restaurant is the dome shaped glass window. It's jaw dropping! The wide side glass windows really opens up the space and gives the entire place a truly unique dining experience. Be sure to request a window seat- this way you have a spectacular view of flashy downtown Las Vegas!   Service: You really can't ask for better service there. We had the manager Cody come check on us a few times. He was such a sweetheart! Our server, Scott, was so nice and funny. He came and checked on us regularly and made sure we were satisfied with service. Oh! And they validate your parking. I didn't know that! Nice little perk!   Price: Very reasonable considering the atmosphere and food quality.   I would definitely come back here. I recommend this to all my buddies. The prices may be a bit steep but essentially, you're paying for a unique dining experience. The atmosphere is 100% different from your typical fine dining!  It's such a hidden gem!!",

    "text": "Sorry Oscar, but it was a let down tonight.  First, you know it's going to be a bad night when you start off with attitude from the hostesses. Ya can't have this table but you can wait for that table, even through your whole meal the table you could have sat in was never used.... Not good.  Second, while not your fault it really sucks that the view has been blocked, bummer. it would also help if the hotel would clean the nasty dirty dome glass once in a while.   So now let's talk about the meal, if my drink had alcohol in it you could have fooled me. Chopped salad was good so that started to give me hope. Then came my steak not so good. Dry, chewy, my friends came out raw. Wife had the stuffed shrimp and liked it...   So when the waiter who was pretty talkative goes on about how he likes this place much better than say Flemings,  I'll go to Flemings in a heart beat over this place.  So we tried it, didn't care for it after all the hype, but now say we tired it.  Hope you have better luck than we did.",

    "text": "Nothing special.   Got the filet mignon (rare) which was very tender and cooked perfectly...I just wish it was a bit more bloody. Haha. The flavor was alright.   Also added a side of king crab legs. For $20 I basically got two crabs legs which were split in half. It wasn't even really good. Texture seemed fresh, but it still lacked flavor even with the addition of lemon juice, butter, and salt. I've had better tasting crab at a buffet and for $20 it was so not worth it.   Other people at my table ordered the New York steak, which was decent and again cooked to the right temperature. The flavor was okay for this as well, albeit it wasn't anything spectacular. If you are expecting to splurge on a piece of meat that will knock your socks off, this isn't it.   We also ordered mushrooms and onions to go with three of the steaks. It was a total of $24 for the mushrooms and $15 for the onions (3 orders each).  The mushrooms were okay (again nothing special), but the onions were wayyyy too sweet. Now I love and prefer grilled/caramelized onions to raw onions because of the sweetness, but these onions were on a whole 'nother level of sweet. Nobody at our table even wanted a second bite. So uh yeah, the mushrooms and onions were a complete waste of money.   Our bill ended up to be over $250 and it wasn't all that...at all.",

My friends Prime looked like it was cut with a spoon and in the shape of a doorstop, they needs to learn how to properly cut prime rib for sure.   Go to Delmonico or one of the steakhouses in the cosmopolitan, you'll be much happier if steak is what your looking for.  Oh yeah, they didn't even have a Rib eye cut other that the Prime Rib....this was odd.  I would say there are less expensive items on the menu, i would have had salmon had i known that the steak would only be soso.  They are really friendly, and the restaurant is very nice with an outstanding view down Fremont street..",

At the end of the evening the Duo that was playing music being filtered into the restaurant sang happy birthday and mentioned his name too! He also had a free piece of birthday cake. It makes me wish I had celebrated my birthday there.  The only sad thing which is nit a reflection on Oscars is that they do not enforce a dress code. Here we were dressed to the nines among the jeans and t shirt tourists. I long for old time Vegas and I thought as Oscars advertises that kind of image that they might think about a dress code.   I would go again and still dress up",

We got there early, about 5:30 or so and they had no problems seating us at an earlier time, which was great as we were prepared to wait. We got a perfect view of the end of Fremont street. Our server was very friendly and a pleasure throughout our dinner as well as the busser or secondary server. Lenora primarily took care of us and Maria kept our glasses full and table clean. The food was very fresh and delicious. The crab cakes, blackened shrimp, and our entrees (the prime rib, and filet) were the standouts.  The prime rib is very large and we had plenty to take home.  The desserts were fantastic and we were able to try several.  The head chef Jeff came out personally to check on us and how our dinner was going, and he also did the same for several other tables.  By the time dinner was over, the place was packed with smiling and laughing faces. I have never had such impeccable service from start to finish at a restaurant, I felt like I was some sort of celebrity being waited on hand and foot, having my crumbs neatly cleaned away and glass always full. Oscar's really made my last birthday in my 20's memorable and a great date night with my guy. Thank you Jeff, Lenora, and Maria! We will certainly be back again in the near future.  Thanks for making my birthday evening over the top and amazing.",

The 1st time we had such a memorable experience, it was my birthday and I felt spoilt with the food, presentation, service and this amazing cheesecake dessert with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written beautifully on the plate. As Vegas locals, my husband and I decided to make going to Oscar's on my birthday a tradition as I enjoyed my experience THAT much! We returned the 2nd time with high expectations. My husband had made reservations a week prior and made note it was my birthday which he reminded the hostess of when he checked us in. We enjoyed \"Happy Hour\" at the bar before we seated and I felt like, although the service was still good, we were rushed through dinner and the food presentation was sloppy. I was so disappointed as it hadn't been communicated to the server that it was my birthday so we left with no birthday surprise. And it was too late by then to go anywhere else. I never got to blow out a candle and make my birthday wish and for that we probably won't return to Oscar's again. To us, this restaurant is a 'special occasion' type of place you splurge for and if they aren't going to make you feel special then we will take our money somewhere else.",

    "text": "Though I've previously dined at Oscar's, it was shortly after their grand opening, so it's been a while. This is strictly for their bar area during happy hour.  Happy hour runs 4-7 pm, though it's a little vague, I had to ask about what it actually included. Was told beer and well drinks were half off. As they had no beer on tap, I went for a house margarita and the other person in my party, after some pondering, went with a Midori sour, served straight up. Midori isn't a well, so no happy hour pricing, but bar tender didn't correct us nor did he actually realize it, I overheard his co- worker correct him in a hushed voice later.   We also ordered calimari, which is priced on a menu at $8, incredibly reasonable for a nice steak house. The portion is so enormous, we couldn't finish it. Sadly, however, it totally lacked flavor and seasoning, just lots of heavily breaded, though thankfully well cooked and not over fried fare.   The bill arrived in two separate parts, one for food and one for drinks, sort of unusual. The calimari was actually cheaper than listed on the menu, so I'm guessing there's some sort of mysterious happy hour pricing involved with appetizers as well.  All of in all- staff is very attentive and friendly, like three people checked on us, decor is nice and the view is great, but no special reason to come back.",

No one was at the reception desk when we arrived-- when she returned she ignored us & got on the phone- another young woman seated us- after checking our reservation- no smile- no welcome- no \"Happy Birthday\".  My husband's rib eye was excellent and my entree was good. Our waiter, Bobby, was not attentive - poor service-- did not check on us after the food was delivered etc. The bus person Alfredo was the most courteous, friendly and helpful staff member in the restaurant. We agreed we wouldn't go back- as locals there are too many great restaurants in the Valley to put up with poor service.",

    "text": "I'm not a big yelper. But I have to share this experience I had at Oscar steakhouse last night. Im a 2nd generation Las Vegan and this has always been on my bucket list to try. A good friend of mine/customer got a promotion at his company so it was definitely a much needed celebration dinner. I made my reservations on OpenTable, and oscars called me a couple hours before to confirm that we're still on for my party of 10. When I showed up To valet my car they somehow knew my name and asked if I was here for the party and then they parked my car in the front of the casino (that was really cool).  We then went upstairs and was greeted respectfully and sat at our table that was amazing, then of course I ordered the famous Oscar Martini it was made perfect in did not disappoint. I glanced over the menu, I already knew what I wanted, I wanted to eat like Oscar Goodman the man that I've looked up to for a long time.  My parents and grandparents would always tell me stories about how Las Vegas used to be when they were growing up, they would explain that they would get dressed up with their friends and significant other and go out to enjoy the casinos. I believe a lot of that is been forgotten over the years that I've seen growing up. But I'm so glad Oscar kept his place the way he did. It was classy and a little gangster, I felt like I was Oscar Goodman for the night LOL. This is a must try place if you're from out of town or especially if your local. This is what Las Vegas truly represents to me and makes me proud to be a Las Vegan. Thank you Oscar Goodman for keeping a gangster",

They offer a happy hour everyday and everyone gets half off.  The bar is quite nice and inviting. There are also pub tables you can sit at or love seat with a coffee table style of seating. We chose the love seats.  We met another couple and had the best time. The service was ok, but there was one server for the bar and it was busy, so the server was not to blame. Another slight negative was it was loud. We had to yell across our \"coffee\" table to hear each other. Three ordered the house cab and I ordered the house chardonnay to start off with.  The chardonnay was ok, but I had just brushed my teeth, so maybe that affected the taste.  I then switched to the house Cabernet and it was great.  I stuck with this the rest of the evening, as did everyone else in the group. We ordered 2 rounds of calamari.  It was a light home-style breading flecked with black pepper, served with 2 sauces; a creamy lemon aioli and a marinara.  The sauces were good but could have used a bigger portion of them.  The calamari was a little inconsistent from the first plate to the second.  The first plate was seasoned well, the second plate was under seasoned.  Overall we had a fabulous time and will return, to maybe try out the fabulous views of Fremont Street in the dinning room.",

Service was solid with attentive multi-person strategy to keep things moving. Salad was underwhelming with too thick dressing and too much tang. We split the ribeye and they missed the mark in medium rare toward medium well. Hard to accept for a high end steak place to miss two temp grades. Cocktails especially the Lemon Dropr Martini was highlight but not enough to put over Hugo's or even Nick and Sams nearby. The old Oscar would have taken his kitchen manager \"for a ride in the desert\" in the good old days.",

    "text": "I had the worst experience while dining here for my birthday in November of last year so bad that it pretty much ruined the night.  Our complete d*ickhead of a server was rude, pretentious and arrogant. I had a large party (all of whom drove from out of state just so they can be at my dinner) and he was so obnoxious while taking our orders. He was so antsy and he kept interrupting us. Dude was most likely on coke because he was just ODD.  Food comes out and it was disappointing. My steak was duh-ry. The creamed spinach lacked something, perhaps salt. Everyone else said their dish was ok but I could tell they were not impressed.  My friends then ask if I get a dessert for my birthday and he rolled his eyes and came back and SLAMMED down a dessert. The table behind us got candles and a song. It was so off awkward so my friends had to sing because I was about to cry.  To top it off he charged us another tables drinks and when we pointed it out he said no it's correct. We had to ARGUE to get the bill changed. I've never had such an aggressive server in my entire life. He then snatched the bill out of our hands and stormed off. I asked to speak to a manager but he/she never came. Everyone was more than irritated after spending $$$ for shitty ass service. I called the restaurant after that but was always told someone would call me and they never did. I gave up but I honestly felt so cheated out of a nice birthday celebration.  Thanks again, Oscar's!",

    "text": "Love this restaurant! The atmosphere is amazing.  Floor to ceiling windows with a great view of downtown lights.  The view used to be better before the zip line was built, which obstructs the view slightly, but still great.  The ambiance of the restaurant makes you feel as if you've stepped back in time to \"old school Vegas\". It's a multi level restaurant with tables and booths all facing the windows so that every table has a view.    Now for the food.  I didn't want to ruin my appetite so I personally didn't start with anything but the soup and salads at the table looked well prepared and there weren't any complaints.    I ordered the filet with the Oscar topping.  The Oscar topping is Bearnaise sauce with lump crab and asparagus.  The sauce was delicious but the lump crab was a little over cooked.  I was disappointed with the presentation also. It just looked like they poured the sauce over the steak and sent it out.  There were a couple miniature squash on the plate to garnish but not set in any particular way again just thrown on.  Which is ok because it all still tasted amazing considering how well the steak was cooked.  Literally melted in my mouth and had great flavor.  I just expected a better presentation given the caliber of restaurant.    My friend had the cedar plank salmon.  She loved it, but to me, it looked over cooked.  The fish was very firm and and completely cooked through.  In my opinion, salmon should be slightly pink in the middle so that it is nice and tender and not dry.  But she liked  it so that's all that mattered.    My friend to the left ordered streak with a mushroom topping.  Again just looked like they threw on some sauteed mushrooms that looked dry.  The mushrooms should have been in some sort of liquid to form a sauce in my opinion but I'm not a chef so what do I know.    The service was great.  Very prompt but gave us enough time to enjoy each others company and not feel rushed.    Overall a great experience.  The atmosphere and service makes up for the small complaints I had about the food.  I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant and hopefully will be back soon!!",

There used to be a nice view up Fremont Street, but since the erection of the zip line structure, you really can't see anything except the Main Street intersection. A lot of the ambiance has been lost.  While the service was very good, the food was simply average. My wife liked the salmon very much, but I thought that the prime rib was simply okay. For a meal tab that was over $100 we could have done better elsewhere.",

My husbands medium rare ny strip Oscar style came out as medium well. The spilotroes steak I ordered came out under done but I would prefer under then over.They also changed how the steak was prepared and did not change the name of the plate. The original one has the steak stuffed with garlic and red pepper. The current one is absolutely plan. It took about a half hour for us to receive our food and it took another 15 min for my husband to receive his new steak that was cooked rare. He would also rather have under than over and he was starving so he accepted it. The crab part of the oscar was a little fishy tasting and we have had better ny strips at Texas road house. Do not gamble on this place for that meal we got ripped off $114. On the plus side we did get a free glass of wine.",

Carpaccio was superb and the crab cakes perfect. We enjoyed ourselves so much we came back the next night for dinner but decided to just enjoy at the bar since the service and company were so great. Perfect for our girls getaway. The artichokes in the chicken were so good we ordered an extra side. The wedge salad was crisp and oh so flavorful. House made ricotta cheese appetizer was one of my favorites. We try a new steakhouse every time we visit Vegas but this will be a for sure stop every time we are in town. Thanks so much Rick and Steve! Keep doing what you do!",

I visited Oscar's on a Saturday night as part of a group of 10 there to celebrate my grandmother's 70th bday. We all had flown in from Cali and looked forward to eating at Oscar's. Brad was a funny host but that did nothing to save the evening from plate after plate after plate of ice cold food. Yes, our $40, $65 and $90 steaks came to our table COLD. Imagine cold meat accompanied by lukewarm mashed potatoes, room temp creamed spinach. Even when the plates returned, the food was still cool, never hot.  While Brad tried to compensate, he ended up frustrated and short-tempered after literally EVERY meal (steak + sides) was sent back except one. Eventually the manager came over and while they took off half of our items, they never apologized or explained WHY the cooks couldn't get it right. Don't visit as a group or you'll be super disappointed AND hungry!!",

After we were sat a beautiful round table right in the center of the restaurant. The view was gorgeous with an open roof and windows all around the site of downtown Fremont was a nice way to enjoy the evening.   Crab cake and meatball appetizers were tasty and a generous portion enough to share amongst the 10 of us. Shrimp served with the shrimp cocktail are huge! I had the sea bass and was shockingly surprised by the size of the fish. Definitely do recomend the seabass if you prefer seafood for dinner. Again, generous portion. Unfortunately the bone in filet was a disappointment, very dry and little flavor. Desserts were a nice way to end the evening. The cheesecake was soft and moist and the creme brulee was delicious. The tiramisu on the other hand was good but the presentation horrible. It looked like slop was just plopped down on the plate.   Service was par. Our server didn't smile once, we looked for her a few times to order another drink and our main entrees arrived about 25 minutes after our appetizers had been cleared from the table.   Not crossing this place off as a possible return however...",

We were planning to eat at the Hash House downstairs but decided to give Oscar's a try.    It was delicious.   We ordered the chicken entree, steak & lobster, prime rib, & bone in rib eye.   My wife & I split the ribeye, as it was 12oz cut.  The food was great.  I had a chicken soup which was amzing.   We all had mashed potatoes/baked potatoes/steak fries.  The asparagus was tasty too.   Service was top notch too.    Very friendly waiter too as he shared a few stories with us.   Will recommend to all my family & friends.   We had originally booked another steakhouse for Christmas day, but the prices was pretty steep for the Xmas day menu.   Thus I saved a ton of money.   Our meal for 5 of us averaged about $60/person - not bad for the meal you get at Oscar's.",

I was invited by friends to try Oscar's happy hour. We ordered the crab cakes (of course), meatballs and fried calamari. I was not a fan of the calamari (too small and mostly breading). The meatballs were flavorful, I just hoped that they were served with some kind of bread to dip in the sauce, they also served them barely warm which was another minus.  Now, for the best part: the crab cakes; I can finally say that I found the best crab cake place in town. The 2 cakes, even at a happy hour price, were big and full of crab meat (almost no breading or fillers) just pure deliciousness!!!! I would have given this place 5 stars if I didn't order the calamari and meatballs.  Our server was very friendly too.  Definitely going back.",

    "text": "If you want a taste of classic Vegas, this is the place to be. Took my girlfriend here for her birthday/Valentine's Day. We were late to our reservation; however, they were still able to accommodate us and give us a beautiful window seat. The wait staff were very friendly and professional. They wiped down the table and removed our dinnerware between each course. We never felt rushed, even though we were there relatively close to closing time. We started with the crab cake appetizer ($21) and cocktails. The crab cake appetizer tasted fresh, was packed with crab, and adorned with a mustard seed sauce. My only comment regarding the crab cake is that there should have been 2 crab cakes versus 1 that is offered, nonetheless... it was amazing. The cocktails were nice to sip on while we waited for our food. Our entrees were the lamb T-bones ($45) and 8 oz. filet mignon ($40) w/ Oscar sauce ($12) on top. We selected creamed spinach ($9) and mashed potatoes ($7) as our sides. All of which was delicious and cooked to perfection. My favorites were the creamed spinach, polenta, and filet bites with crab from the Oscar sauce. Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, they gave her a nice piece of New York cheesecake, rich and creamy. The restaurant atmosphere was beautiful, tranquil, and intimate. The dining room has been featured in so many shows and movies, I am sure some of you have seen it on the screen... its time to see it live. All-in-all, if you are looking for a fancy steak house with the everlasting flare of Vegas... Oscars is the spot!",

    "text": "Random dinner on a Monday night with my spouse and my dear friend Kate resulted in us stumbling in to Oscar's. I was mighty reluctant as the signage denoted \"beef, beer and broads.\" So I instantly thought it was some type of sports bar. NOPE. It's a high end steak house that is well worth a visit.  Named for the former mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, Oscar's sits above the hustle and bustle of the Fremont Street Experience and is beautifully decorated. We sat in a perfectly situated booth that was extremely comfy. As we walked to the table I felt like we were in a movie about mafia drug lords. But it was a great experience.  The prices were more than I wanted to spend, but when I got the food it was TOTALLY worth it. My partner and I had the surf and turf and added a piece of blackened salmon to it. It was delicious. I don't mean that lightly either. I HATE steak, despise it and this was THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. With the surf and turf came crab stuffed shrimp with tomatoes and grilled artichokes. These, too, were delicious (and I hate artichokes).  We tried three sides: the mashed potatoes, asparagus and the Mac-n-cheese. It stands to mention that the sides are served family style and can be shared between parties. I enjoyed all the sides we ordered. The asparagus was cooked perfectly. It still tasted fresh. The mac-n-cheese was delicious! Creamy and plentiful. The mashed potatoes were equally as good.  The service was impeccable. I was very happy with the attention and expertise of or server Lorene. She was incredibly professional, yet personable and friendly. Very attentive to our needs.   When I got the bill I was proud to pay cause the value and the experience was incredible.  Treat yourself and go to Oscar's.",

We had the same thing, Caesar salad, filet and cheesecake. Bobby was our server and he was awesome. Very personable without pretentiousness. Hate when a server is fake nice, Bobby was just a good guy. Food was really good. Salad was a typical salad, but the steak was so tender you almost didn't need a knife. So tasty and cooked perfectly. Came with mashed potatoes which were also good and asparagus. Asparagus was huge, little too big for me so I just ate the tops. Cheesecake was delicious and came with a side of berries. Great night, will definitely be back, and ask for Bobby!",

This next visit on a Thursday night we were seated in a great booth that was used in the movie Casino.  Great views of Fremont street.  We shared fried Calamari, a Caesar salad a huger bakes potato and one of the best pieces of prime rib I've had in Las Vegas.  I usually will only eat prime rib in lieu of steaks and have eaten at many steakhouses in Vegas.  Our waiter, Bobby, is a professional!  We couldn't have asked for someone better to pamper us!",

It would've been nice to know the specials of the day like every other table, but the look we got when we sat down, I knew right away, this was going to be a long, lack of service night.  We got there at 530 on a sunday night and we were the 3rd table to be seated.  When we sat, less than 15 seconds, our waiter came by and asked for questions on the menu.  We didnt even have the menu yet!!!  He was annoyed with us for some reason!  When he came back to ask again any question, I asked if he can tell me about the veal...his answer, \"its good!\"  Wow...thanks! No details, nothing...maybe tell me a bit more...after all, YOU asked me about if I had any questions!   After we ordered and more guests came in...I was surprised to see how friendly our waiter was to everyone else. They got the specials right away, friendly chatting, ...I never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before.  It was also cool to hear from our waiter (when he was so friendly to other tables) that we were sitting in the old pool area of the plaza! The space is small, so you can hear everything, specials and cool stories!  To top everything off, when asked about dessert, I stated I would like to take advantage of the Yelp check in free dessert special...oh boy, did I get the eyes rolled for that. With a heavy breath...our waiter rudely stated, \"For that, you have no choice, so no need for a menu...\"  Pretty dramatic of him!  Ya, never again...I knew I was not welcomed there, and shame on them for employing such a judgmental, rude server. Obscenely obvious, you did not want to wait on my wife and I! I have more class than you to blow your name up on here, but I do have your name and know I will never recommend Oscars because of you.",

    "text": "I recently signed up for the IndiCard App for service industry workers to receive a discount from restaurants. So my husband and I saw Oscar's had a 20% off offer and wanted to give them a try. We walked in Tuesday night with no reservation and were seated promptly in the center most table facing down Fremont st. We were impressed by the ambiance and the view and were both super excited to dine there expecting nothing but an exceptional dining experience. Boy... were looks deceiving. Our waitress approached our table and I immediately told her about my IndiCard discount because I know as a server I like to know about discounts ahead of time. She wasn't familiar with the card, which I understood because I was new to it as well, and said she needed to ask her manager which was fine. About 7 min later a well dressed man who I assumed was a manager approached and noticed we only still had water and asked if we were ready to order so we told him our entire order... an old fashioned, a fruity cocktail for me, and the filet mignon medium rare Oscar style with 3 sides of Brussels sprouts, creamed corn and onion strings. Our drinks arrived, they were ok, the old fashioned was kinda syrupy. Our food arrived with all three side and the filet mignon but not Oscar styled. We informed the food runner that was missing and he went to find the server. As we waited we cut into the filet which was burnt on the outside and blue on the inside. My husband and I both felt it tasted like whopper meat from Burger King it was so charred. Our sever returned to tell us our \"Oscar style\" was on its way and we told her our filet tasted burnt. She took it to have a new one made and we were left with out creamed corn, Brussels sprout and onion straw sides left on the table so we ate those. Another 10-15 min went by and we finished our sides without being checked on by our server or manager who took our order. By then I realized we had been there a while and all we had to show were ok drinks, bread, and side dishes that were now either gone or cold and we had no steak or apology for how long it was all taking. So I decided for the first time In my service industry life to grab my husband and get up and leave without paying for anything. I would normally tip too because it sometimes isn't the servers fault but I believe it was all around a bad experience from every person we interacted with. I walked right up to the manager who took our order and told him how severely disappointed I was in our service and I just wanted to leave and we did. It's so sad they have such a wonderful ambiance and dining room that screams you should have a great dining experience but unfortunately I will never go back again... discount or not.",

Back at my hotel I got a recommendation about two steak houses; one of which was Oscar's  Beef Booze and Broads at the Plaza Hotel and Casino opposite from my hotel on Freemont Street  Named after Oscar Goodman, the former mayor of Las Vegas and in the plaza above the Hash House, I headed up there for their Valentine's Day special, $50 prime rib steak, smashed potatoes and one of the best onion soups I have tasted in a while.  This time the food was portioned just right. I was able to finish everything and a dark coffee as well.  They have a sexy clientele of ladies, both customers and staff at the bar and although the broads (staff) were a little bit too old for my taste, the food was first class. Well worth a visit. Total cost of meal excluding drinks $50+gratuities and drinks extra. I paid $68 for everything. Not bad for a steak house. In NYC you would be hitting above $100 quite easily.",

He is probably the friendliest and classiest server my wife and I have ever had. It also helps they also offer a better NY strip than any we've had at other steakhouses in town including Gordon Ramsey's. Hands down a must visit every time we come to Vegas. We stay on the strip every time but make a trip to Fremont just to eat here, that's how good it is. Already looking forward to our next trip and will ask for Bobby every time we're there.",

This historical land mark has had many names as a restaurant but the best representation of Vegas and fine dining goes by the name of Oscars. I've been wanting to eat here for years. Spontaneously my friend and I decided to dine here this evening. We called around 6 for an 8:30 reservation and they were very accommodating. We had the best seat in the house with a view looking down the Fremont street experience (which is partially blocked by the damn zip line). Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgable. We ordered the NY steak 14oz to share with the sides of Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Our appetizer was the bruschetta. The complimentary bread they serve is so delicious that I really could have gone without the bruschetta to be honest although it was delish.   The steak was the best steak I have ever had. And I have had a lot of steaks. Medium rare, just as God intended steak to be. Crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The seasonings were perfect. Now I am going to have steak dreams! ... Get your steak on and just succumb to the slogan of \"BEEF, BOOZE, AND BROADS.\" And then you might get to meet the famous lawyer and keeper of mob secrets Oscar Goodman himself. I met him tonight too.",

    "text": "We recently held a convention in the Plaza for a few days, mainly because of location to all things Fremont Street & Downtown. Prior to going, I had scoped out a place that some of us could go to sit and talk while having cocktails.    Oscar's is perfect for that.   Full Disclosure:  We spent 4 nights in the bar from open to close and on our last night we had dinner.    Lounge:  I'm a Plopper.  I like to sit and watch the world go by.  Depending on your location, Oscars is perfect for this.  There are 3 types of seating.  Standard bar top, high top tables & comfortable chairs and couches.  Unlike many of the lounges/bars on Fremont, Oscar's doesn't cram you elbow to elbow with some stranger danger.   We discovered on our first night there, we could happily nosh off their menu. They have an extensive cocktail list as well and full bar.  Sunday night we were the only ones in the bar/lounge portion, but the restaurant itself was quite busy. Our waiter was actually the bartender so our drinks were perfection.    I am a die hard bloody Mary girl from way back but I've discovered the Carolyn - named after Her Honor, Ms. Mayor.  The menu said made with gin, but I can assure you it works well with vodka. We alternated between the Carolyn and a Patron margarita.    At the suggestion of the staff, who all came over at one point or anther to welcome us to the Plaza & Oscars, we had the caprese salad called Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad, the crab cakes & shrimp cocktail.  Excellent and light choices.  Oscar's #1 Broad, who is actually 2 different woman, made it a point to hang out with us several times a night.  Yes we are just THAT interesting. LOL.   As our succession of nights progressed we also tried the Jose Leonardo's Roasted Corn Brulee,  Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese & Hymie's Latkes. all side dishes from the main menu and all done extremely well.    Our last night, we hosted a dinner for 6 in the restaurant.  They seated us in the prime location, front and center of the window that looked straight down Fremont, as it was bathed in the golden light of Vegas.   I started with the onion soup, continued with Nicky's chicken and finished with a shared creme brulee. Our dinner guest each had the Carolyn cut of the prime rib with various toppings and sides. NOTE: the sides are very plentiful and can certainly be shared family style as are the appetizers. Since these are locals, they are used to the 9.99 prime rip. The Carolyn is NOT one of those, cut and cooked to perfection. Our total bill for 6, including several rounds of cocktails was under $300.00 with a 20% tip.    Since it was still early, we retired back to our spot in the lounge.  Imagine our surprise and delight that the MAN himself came over and sat with us.    Going to Oscar's you won't find yard long drinks or fishbowls full of cheap liquor but what you will find is a throwback to when people dressed to go to dinner, had cocktails at 6pm and considered it an experience instead of just getting as drunk as possible.  Ok we did some of that too.    2nd Full disclosure:  our nightly bar bill for anywhere from 2-6 people ran about $150.00 per night.  Well worth finding this little gem of heaven to watch the world go by.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I did not have a steak. But, I have gone to culinary school and the food I did have was quite disappointing, so I was really glad I didn't order a steak. I hate having to send food back when I'm dining with a group (which I was) and my prediction is that the steak would've needed to be sent back.  Oscars bills itself as a first class steakhouse.  I'd expect it to have a chef on premises tasting the food and making sure that everything is excellent.  I strongly suspect that isn't the case.  When I'm looking at $100 per person without drinks, I expect a super meal, not something phoned in.  I ordered the beef and barley soup, which was described as being made with home made stock and fresh vegetables along with prime rib. The stock was (I strongly suspect) not house-made--it was bland and greasy and nothing like the stock I make at my house.  The prime rib was chewy. The barley was under-cooked.  My husband had the French onion soup and had the same review--it was just awful.  I ordered a $15 side of lobster mac & cheese......the lobster was flabby and not sweet.....I suspect it was frozen and then thawed, and maybe they didn't even squeeze the water out.   For $15, I honestly expected very few pieces of lobster but I did expect them to be firm and succulent....which is why people order lobster (or lobster-anything).     My husband ordered what he thought was an entree sized chopped salad and it came doused in so much dressing that it never lost its shape after being squished into a ring form (like restaurants do for things like a stacked tuna tartare).  He said it was mediocre at best.  I tasted my friends' orders of au gratin potatoes (okay) and truffled mashed potatoes (very good, but $15?).  Honestly, if Oscar's wants to be considered to a first class steakhouse they're going to need to up their game with these side dishes, salads and soups. Who wants a dinner brought down by the fact that the sides and salads/appetizers are terrible?   If you can't make those things well, then take them off the menu.",

The restaurant is small and intimate by Las Vegas steakhouse standards and affords an interesting even if obstructed view of the Downtown Freemont Street Experience. I was greeted and seated promptly at a nice table and after checking in with Yelp given a complimentary glass of Pinot Noir which was very nice. I took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the Prime New York steak, sauteed mushrooms on the side and creamed spinach. I passed on a salad as I was sure I wouldn't even finish what I had ordered (I was correct). While sampling fresh baked onion bread I noticed the appetizers being enjoyed at an adjoining table and couldn't help but wish I had been eating with enough friends to warrant an appetizer or two. The calamari and the assorted cold cut/cheese plate looked wonderful. My dinner arrived after a reasonable wait and I was very pleased with the steak. My waiter was spot on; the New York steak was tender, delicious and done perfectly. The mushrooms were just good and complimented the steak. The creamed spinach was disappointing particularly since I had that at Ruth's Chris two weeks ago and it was terrific there. Still the meal was very good overall due to the steak. The service was very good and attentive. One note is that the clientele were well dressed particularly by current Las Vegas norms. That made the entire evening a bit nicer. I'm happy I tried Oscar's and wouldn't mind going back with a group especially to try a couple of the appetizer dishes. I would order the same steak but not the mushrooms or spinach; maybe a salad instead.",

I only heard one good review, and it was from this guy named David Sadjak, who lives by the motto; \"A free meal always tastes better\".  He loves Bucca Di Pepo, and every second rate buffet in town, that gives him free or half priced food, and in his case, someone else was buying.  I had to see for myself. I can only sum it up one way;  On Anthony Bourdain's programs, he always tastes the food and then raves how good it is. If he has nothing good to say, he just doesn't say it. He talked with Mayor Goodman about the \"old days\" of Las Vegas, and did not say one thing about the food.  Since I can't say anything nice, out of respect to Mayor Goodman, and his service to the City, I will simply not say anything.",

Beef, Booze and Broads....so three in our party of four had the steak, one chicken with artichokes and all had booze....However, the broad looked a little tired and failed to stop by our table to wish us a good dining experience.  The beef was excellent, the beef eaters all ordered Joey C's filet, one had that served Oscar with lump crab, asparagus and Bearnaise sauce.  The steaks were tender and cooked to perfection.  The bearnaise was one of the best I have eaten both in taste, temperature and consistency.  It melted perfectly into the beef.  Chicken and artichokes was good as well, however, the sauce that it is served with was a bit salty.    We ordered mashed potatoes (excellent) and creamed spinach as sides for the table.  None of us cared for the creamed spinach, the cream was not very creamy.  We wish we had gone for sauteed spinach.  So why did I only give this place a three......the waiter, a gentleman with long grayish hair pulled back in a ponytail had a superior condescending attitude.  We are locals and we travel and dine out extensively.  We seek out dining experiences, so while the food was excellent the waiter really put a damper on an otherwise excellent evening.  It started when one member of the party asked which steak was better and waiter with attitude kind of chuckled at such a 'stupid\" question and said \"whichever one you like best\".  very helpful then he acted perturbed as the diner tried to decide which to get....  One member of our party saw the onion rings that were served at another table and asked waiter with attitude to please bring some to our table.  They were not served when out entrees came out but we figured since we ordered them a little later they would come later...That wasn't the case and waiter with attitude never did stop back to see if we wanted anything...  Because of waiter with attitude we decided to fore go desert...We will go back to Oscars but will specifically request that we not be seated in waiter with attitude's section......If he is still there.......",

The dining area is located in the dome directly above where the front valet entrance is for The Plaza. The dimly lit circular dining room provided a front row seat to the Freemont Street Experience. We were able to enjoy the festive light shows and people watch all throughout dinner.  There is definitely room for improvement when it comes to service. After our dinner, we were asked if we would like dessert. I said yes. Our waiter disappeared for 5 minutes only to return to tell us that he could not find a dessert menu. (The restaurant was not full. There were empty tables. So how is it that they ran out of or somehow he was not able to locate a dessert menu?) When it was time for our check, our waiter was nowhere to be found. The assistant waiter told us our waiter will be back in 3 minutes.  Onto the food:  Lobster Bisque($8): Mediocre. A bit on the salty side. Fish of the Day ($32): It was the Bass and and it was bland. To be honest, I didn't even finish it. It tasted like something from a cheap buffet. Very disappointing. Creme Brulee ($7-8): Mediocre. The caramelize finish was not really achieved. The actual creme part lacked vanilla. However I did enjoy the fresh fruit (strawberry, raspberry, etc.)  Now what about the \"broads?\" I mean, it is in the name of the restaurant and I too was curious about this. As soon as we were seated, it was quick to see who they were. They weren't skanky looking or anything. Just a pair of girls, looked like any other girls you would find walking around at a club wearing their little black dress. They sat down at a table with 3 guys and they had a couple rounds of drinks and then they got up and left. Didn't really have any effect on my dining experience.   However, I would recommend dismissing the broads and using that capital to focus on the dishes, which is sadly in need of work. To be charging main courses from anywhere between $25 to $40+ a plate and having it taste like something from a dime a dozen buffet line is a real shame.   Would I recommend this place? I think not.   (The only reason why I ate here was because my dinner was comped. If I had to pay out of my own pocket, I think this review would've been a lot angrier. Haha)",

And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse.   Entering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review).   The menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good.   The restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view.   All in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently.   Oscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week.   I sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will.",

    "text": "My hubby and I celebrated my birthday here. It was a  fun experience and food was good. We had crab cakes, two petite filets, mashed potatoes and four cocktails; spent $150. It was a great experience for the price. Service was friendly and efficient; Bobby was old school (in a Goodman way) and made us laugh. Ambiance was nice. Although it was the Plaza... Can't change that.   We both ordered our 8-ounce filets medium rare and both cuts were different; one came out medium and thin while the other was perfect. Luckily my awesome husband traded with me and gave me the perfect cut. He also traded steak knives (the knives they give to the ladies are a little wimpy!!)  They gave us cheesecake on the house and it was yummy!   Overall I had a great birthday that didn't break the bank.",

    "text": "Ok ok.. Oscars! I must say probably one of the best steaks I have ever had!! Got the filet mignon on Oscar style and it was cooked perfectly, very flavorful and the oscar style (it's a bernaisse sauce with asparagus and mushrooms I think) didn't over power the flavor of the steak. Also, the French onion soup was amazing, this is the French onion soup that has started my love of French onion soup.  The restaurant is in the plaza and overlooks the freemont street experience (you can see the view of this restaurant in the movie casino where Robert dinero and Sharon stone are having dinner). Great atmosphere and very friendly wait staff. The only thing that didn't make sense was the \"broads\" thing.. There are ladies that walk around and talk to you to help give you the vibe of the old days I guess I don't know. It's a great idea and I'm sure it could be executed well but the broad we had was very bland, uninteresting and somewhat awkward, it seemed like she didn't know what to say or something kind of just asked about how everything was like a waiter. If there was more substance like \"oh where you guys from?\" Then maybe some facts about Vegas or how casino was filmed there (me being born and raised in Vegas I would know it all but I mean just  something interesting.   Overall at Oscars great food and atmosphere definitely would like to go back and get that filet and soup!",

    "text": "Okay. 2.5 stars. Overall okay, not great. Certainly not worth the $$$.  The service was sketchy. Less than 1 minute after we sat down, were approached by a server (that's good!?), asking for our drink order. I asked for a minute, re: our coats were not even off at the time.  17 minutes later, no water, no re-visit, no menu...the floor manager (Cody, I think...) asked if we had been helped. \"Not really\", we replied. Water and menus and drink orders followed.  Thank you Cody! Food was unremarkable  as other reviews indicate. Not high end quality as prices would suggest. Bread and water delivered well AFTER appetizer was served. The \"prime\" rib was good, not great. My guess it was a Choice or Select beef roast, not Prime. (Note to Oscar: Vegas has primo meat purveyors. You're telling me this is \"Prime\"? As  we say in the mid-west,  Brother Please! ) Spouse's filet was very nice, although the requested blue cheese  topping did not appear with the steak. Had to be requested a second time, and delivered in chunks cold on a side plate, after most of the filet had been consumed. Sides (au gratin , spinach) were served room temp, not hot. Portions were large.  Our first two wine list choices were \"not available\", so made a third choice. To their credit, they offered our third choice at 2nd choice price (again, thank you Cody! But by this time he was obviously embarrassed and weary of apologizing. We felt badly for the guy). Suggestion for Oscar: Hire a top notch manager,  pay attention to inventory control, train the wait staff on some basics customer service skills (they appear to want to do a good job, & buss staff working really hard, but chaos was the norm),  staff for a busy room, (which, despite your mediocre food and service offering, you still seem to enjoy), and buy better quality beef roasts. Or, keep taking $ from chump Vegas visitors and laugh all the way to the bank...either way, we won't be back.",

    "text": "The recent renovation has put a fresh, modern face on the nearly-iconic domed dining space at The Plaza. The one overlooking Fremont Street in fabulous downtown Las Vegas. Take the escalator to the 2nd floor and you will see Oscar's Beef, Booze, and Broads steakhouse.  Service was friendly, informed, and efficient. Food was quite wonderful. Being locals, we were delighted to see a Las Vegas legend on the menu ... Alpine Village's Chicken Noodle Soup. Not your typical chicken noodle soup, but so savory and satisfying!  Now I do recall the Alpine Village restaurant, but never enjoyed their chicken noodle soup, so I am not sure how Oscars' version compares. I hope a Yelper who has first hand knowledge will share their \"soupinion\".  We had a window table, close to the center of the dome, with a fun and entertaining view of the people parade on Fremont street below.   Our entrees, the Halibut Special and Bone-In Prime Rib, were fabulous! Halibut was perfectly cooked, and the prime rib was ginormous, medium well, and still tender. Oscar's horsey sauce is top-notch as well; perfectly balanced to our taste. We ordered the creamed spinach and mac and cheese for sides. Both were good, albeit slightly under-seasoned, but adding a little salt/pepper was an easy fix.  Splurging for dessert, I chose the Creme Brulee, and he had the Tiramisu (both made in-house). I actually thought I was full after dinner, but somehow that magical creme brulee vanished mysteriously into my mouth within seconds. It was crazy good!  The tiramisu was yummy too, but the CB still makes my mouth water.  Not so crazy about the \"broads\" aspect ... Nice enough ladies, but the whole bit felt kind of like being visited by an annoying mariachi band with tits. I am not sure I would want to wander a room full of strangers, wearing an evening dress, like a puppy begging for attention, making small talk and then expecting the strangers to pay for that privilege. Awkwaaaard!   Overall, a fun and enjoyable dining experience, and the bar appeared to be hoppin' as well. We also thought that the cool smoking lounge outside the restaurant/cocktail lounge was a nice touch, appreciated, and thoroughly enjoyed.",

    "text": "Popped in with a party of eight and no reservations on Valentine's Day to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday! Luckily, there was an eight-top in the lounge! Live music was great, curtains should open for a view.  Service was super friendly but slow-going from the start, they should've been prepared and had more servers in the lounge.  They were offering a three course menu for v-day $60 or $85 with wine pairings. Four of us got that - two with Scallops and one with filet. Two others got NY strip, one got the pork chop and one the flank steak. We all shared bites - because we are family! And all of the food was amazing!! I'd say the NY strip was best, even though it wasn't my selection.  This review might of gotten five stars, but the fact that my grandma's dessert - included in the three course meal took 20 minutes longer than ours - and we noticed later they charged extra for it combined with the 45 minute wait for our check put a damper on the experience.  Also, I secretly told the server we were celebrating a 60th birthday and she never even mentioned it, much less did anything special.",
