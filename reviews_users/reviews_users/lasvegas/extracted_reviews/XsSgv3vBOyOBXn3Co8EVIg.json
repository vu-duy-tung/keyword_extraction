    "text": "Even though I have spent hours upon hours at Q Karaoke these past years, I never noticed the restaurant next to it until my friend treated me here for my birthday.   The place has a casual, but somewhat intimate atmosphere because of the secluded positioning of some of the tables. Luckily, those tables have buzzers that customers can use to let the servers know they're needed, so that's not an issue. The waiters are nice, albeit not very personable. Maybe it's because this place seems to cater to Korean customers more?  I ordered bulgogi pizza. The crust was too thick for me, and it was topped with so many ingredients that it was difficult to pick it up, but it was good enough to enjoy.   On the brighter side, the food portions here are huge. To newbies, I suggest ordering two or three dishes for 4-6 people to share and then adding onto that order later. Sharing will also keep the price down by a ridiculous amount, making this one of the cheapest places in Vegas to stuff yourself with Korean food at.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for a casual affordable dinner with a couple of friends.",

It's weird but yummy lol also try the stir fried pork belly and squid! Sizzling spicy goodness! The portions are huge so we had enough to take home for another meal. I like the free sides they give as well, they're delicious and perfect to munch on while waiting for your order. The servers are attentive and friendly. I showed them my check in and we got a free (HUGE) shaved ice. It was so good we didn't care that we were getting cold from eating it lol We can't wait to drink here next time. They have so many foods that go great with beer and such.",

    "text": "Having seen the high ratings on this new korean place, I was REALLY excited to try the Q bistro.   Here's the break down:  Service was HORRIBLE.  Basically a few kids more interested in staring at the cash register than doing their jobs. We rang the service bell three times before we got any attention, took at least 5 minutes to order and another 5 minutes to get our beer.   Food  Wings - crispy outside but soggy inside. Too much garlic in the flavor.  Seafood pancake: decent, but once it got cold the oil used became more rancorous in taste.  An-ju. Pretty decent, liked the siracha/mayo dipping sauce, grilled squid nice texture and not overcooked.  Yuk gae jang - possibly the worst I've ever had in my life. Soup tasted eerily similar to msg-laden Shin ramen instant soup mix - not fresh, and barely any beef in it.   Rice- for me a barometer of a Korean restaurant (second only to ban Chan of which there was none offered). Was mealy, dry and lacking any redeeming value.  Beer/wine list probably worst in my recent memory. No craft/draft beers, only korean wines (which is an insult to the word \"wine\" usually), they ran out of asahi so we were stuck with Sapporo and hite.   If only my korean bretherens owning restaurants in vegas ditched the \"the least I can do to make the most profit\" modus operandi and put some passion and imagination into their trade!!",

Overall good value. I'm surprised that this place is not always packed because it is a hidden gem. The decor is good. Waitresses are cute and attentive.

    "text": "Being associated to Karaoke Q Studio, I actually expected dining inside one of those karaoke rooms with some random crowd singing to really cheesy songs.  I was mistaken, however, as the restaurant is located in a separate space right next door.  I guess this bistro has been open for over a year now but only heard about it recently.  Ambiance was nice except for the blasting EDM that almost gave me a headache... at least all alcohol was BUY ONE GET ONE FREE (only during World Cup) which greatly helped soon as the booze started flowing.  The menu includes both typical and nontraditional Korean dishes.  Dukbokke (soft rice cake, fish cake, and sweet red chili sauce) was really tasty with portion big enough for two to three people.  Korean fried chicken (KFC of South East Asia) was also delicious.  Crust stayed crispy even when it was drenched in sweet and spicy sauce.  It almost reminded me of my first time having it at Bonchon during a trip in the Philippines; however, it's just like comparing apples to pears.  The ones from this restaurant have thicker coating and were glazed with too much sauce.  Nonetheless, the dish itself is great and worth coming back for.  One dope thing they do is their Yelp check-in special: free small patbingsoo.  Not sure if it's only for the first visit or every time you do it.  Considering the dessert was complimentary, we thought it was just going to be shaved ice topped with strawberries and condensed milk.  Surprisingly, it was topped with cereal, sweet red beans, assorted fresh fruits (kiwi, cantaloupe, strawberry, honeydew, banana, mango), vanilla ice cream and drizzled with condensed milk.  Overall, Q Bistro is definitely a great joint for late night dining especially since they're open till three in the morning.",

I think we just happen to prefer red sauce with little to no sweetness but this had a lot of sweet flavor and not up our alley. For someone who likes a sweeter red sauce this would be really good though.  Loved the atmosphere, the Kpop music, the decorations, and the server guy was super super nice!! We will definitely come back again. :)",

    "text": "On night float I get two days off per week, but since I stick to a night schedule and am not into bars or clubbing, there isn't much to do in the middle of the night on days off. Thus, I decided to go with the other intern on nights at our other hospital for a late-night meal. My colleague had never tried Korean food before, so since Q Bistro was open late, we decided to dine here.  Q Bistro has an adjacent karaoke place next door, which at 1:15AM was still very busy and popular, though in the bistro/food side, there was only one other party dining when I entered. The interior is very modern and there is K-pop playing in the background, so definitely a very hip place.  There was only one employee working this late at night, but she was very friendly and attentive, checking on us regularly throughout the meal. And if you ever have trouble flagging down your server, there is a call button at every table as well.  I know that Q Bistro is known for their chicken wings/Korean fried chicken and have interesting items like bulgogi pizza, but since it was my friend's first foray into Korean food, I decided to stick to more traditional dishes. In addition, she only eats halal meat but eats seafood so we stuck to seafood options.  I was a bit disappointed at the banchan; we only got four dishes and one was a hotdog dish and another was a spiral pasta salad, both somewhat unusual banchan and not all that exciting. The other two were fish cake and japchae, which were better.   For our actual meal, we shared three dishes: seafood soft tofu stew, seafood pancake, and stir-fried rice cakes. We ordered the soft tofu at medium spice level, and it wasn't very spicy at all, though the rice cakes dish comes moderately spicy. The seafood pancake was nice and crispy but a tad on the oily side; it was also cut into small, ~2cm squares, which made it easier to dip in the sauce, though I've never seen seafood pancake cut this way before.  All in all, the food was solid, the prices reasonable, and the portions decent, but I've had way better Korean food elsewhere. I'd still like to come back and try their fried chicken and pizza though!  P.S. The check-in offer of free shaved ice is amazing! The portion is HUGE and comes with lots of fresh fruit, ice cream, and cereal flakes; basically patbingsu without the pat!",

Despite the amount of people signed up to wait, the wait was not very long at all! They have a ton of variety of songs available ranging from any current Asian pop songs up to very famous American songs. In no time, we were partying with Twice and the next with Bruno Mars. Moreover, Q provides a whole menu of food and drink that cater to your karaoke snack needs. This is my first time here, and from what I can see, it won't be the last.",

Heck, they even have a call bell for you to press on the table so you can get their attention anytime. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were superb along with fresh whip cream to dip. It was nice and soft inside while remaining crunchy outside. Their spicy tofu soup was also excellent, keeping the soft tofu intact and not all broken like most other places when served to you. And oh boy, the cheese tonkatsu caught me by surprise, it is very well presented and have a nice and fresh crunch to it. Also served with rice and a croquette , all for just $11! It is a steal and I highly recommend it. Definitely would come back to this place to try the other menu items! Hope this encourage some of you guys to come and try their fusion food!",

The wings were nice and crispy and dripping in a combination of soy ginger and sweet sauce.  They were good, but I wanted a spicier sauce, so we asked for the spicy Korean sauce that's normally on Korean fried chicken.  It was exactly what they needed.  Sweet and spicy!  Of the soups we ordered (dumpling soup, bone broth soup, spicy tofu soup) I really like the dumpling soup, though all were good.    The service here was great.  The girls working there were attentive and friendly.  Not usually the hallmark of a Korean establishment.    Ended dinner with a free shaved ice for checking in on Yelp.  Shaved ice, ice cream, fresh fruits and condensed milk.  Very refreshing in the Vegas heat!    The one drawback is the parking lot is crazy, even after midnight.",

If you come here, plan on waiting about 40 minutes before hearing the excuse that their kitchen is shared with the karaoke bistro or that their frier isn't the right temperature. I've been here 3 times and the service is bottom line not good. I only come back for their lemon chicken with green onions. The chicken itself is very crispy and moist.   Last time I came, the waiter completely forgot about our order until we asked him 30 minutes later. He said he would check up on it, but I saw him print out the ticket and bring it to the kitchen... And with the sane excuse, he said their kitchen is busy because they use for karaoke too. I sat right by the kitchen and saw the chefs talking because they had nothing to do:/ When we left after our meal, we walked past the karaoke bistro and of course, it was EMPTY.   At least today, the waitress apologized but gave us the excuse their frier wasn't hot enough. Then the waitor came to say sorry, but this time said the kitchen was busy? Um, so where's my food?... He gave us mini corndogs for free though. I think next time I will just get take out.",

    "text": "I have been here a handful of times.  Usually order the chicken (soy/garlic) because those drumsticks are delicious and meaty.  The last time I went here was no bueno.  First off, THERE WAS NO CHICKEN at dinner time on a Friday at 7:30pm.  I expect a restaurant that advertises something on a banner outside their store front to deliver said item.  Apparently, this wasn't the first time it's happened according to other guests in our party.  Okay, when I said \"no chicken\" I mean they only had chicken wings...but like I said, the drumstick is better and way meatier.  They said it would take 2 hours to defrost the drumsticks.  We begrudgingly ordered the wings.    The service was horrendous and the delivery of dishes was poor.  Why would the server drop off cheese corn at the table when everyone has finished eating?  It can't possibly take an hour to melt cheese on corn and then serve it.    The final straw was watching the servers prepare YOUR TO GO MEALS ON THE TRASH CART.  Yes, the server was touching your ready to eat salad with his hands as he prepped this on the cart with the garbage can attached.  When the manager was notified of this, he had the server move into the kitchen and continue.  And we could still see the server prepping the food without gloves.    Horrible management and questionable sanitation.",

The kimchi stew is spicy and delicious! And then everything else the pork belly and beef intestines were heavenly!   You must try this place and enjoy the quaint chic atmosphere while eat some delicious fresh, hot and tasty korean cuisine. The staff is friendly and helpful too. They offer advice on menu items if needed and check on you to make sure everything is satisfying.   I LOVE IT! the only thing that would make it better is if Korean POP AND HIP HOP music was playing instead of techno ... BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING!!! LOVE IT!!!!  I must become a duchess here!",

It also came with a lot of free side dish options, like japchae and various radishes. The chicken is super crispy, but the soy garlic flavor just tasted only like honey,  no soy, now garlic. The supreme has a stronger garlic flavor, but was still too sweet. The rice in the bibimbap and the kimbop was really mushy like it was cooked with too much water. Overall everything was very mediocre.",

Our server was great; friendly and fast. We ordered their half & half pizza with pepperoni/bulgogi, bulgogi kimbap, and kimchi soup. First off, their bulgogi pizza is definitely something different. I didn't hate it but it quite alright. Their dough for the pizza is definitely good. Kimchi soup was very savory. It had allot of kimchi, a little too much.. Bulgogi kimbap was good. Side dishes are unlimited refill and their macaroni salad is sooooo good! Total came out to be around 35$ for two people dining in, not bad. Definitely will be back to try other dishes.",

    "text": "The establishment is a duo of a karaoke bar and a restaurant.  Both are bit loud to my liking. Or am just too old and my tolerance to noise has changed.  But the mostly KPOP music in the background was too loud so everybody was yelling while conversing.    The last time I was here was prior to them remodeling and making the place more hip and more inviting to the younger (millennials, that is) crowd.  Back then, the place looked a little divey but people didn't care because it was a good place to drink, get wasted, sing karaoke shamelessly and munch on chicken wings.  Life was much simpler then.    I was initially served a banchan of japchae, brined daikon cubes, something with mayonnaise that I didn't taste (pasta salad?) and something else (i assumed they were pickled king mushrooms), and a bowl of lettuce salad with thousand island-miso dressing.   Dinner consisted of half portion (10pcs) chicken wings in soy garlic glaze and an order of galbi beef.  Wings are a little big than usual.  The batter/breading made them even bigger.  Each bite of the well seasoned wing was a combination of hard and crunchy.  The glaze was the star of the show, as always.  Wings were served with their heaping version of coleslaw.  The beef galbi was scrumptious.  It was tender, not too fatty, not to sweet and not too salty.  It was served sizzling hot with and over tons of  sliced white onions.     Q Bistro is and will always be a popular joint in Chinatown.  They may have and offer a long list of dishes on their menu but they never fail to deliver when it comes to good chicken wings!",

Don't let the big karaoke sign throw you off- Q Bistro is a legit good restaurant.  The decor is trendy and great for groups. Love the kpop mvs being projected on the wall!  We had a 20 min wait for our food, but our waiter warned us ahead of time, which we appreciated. They were super busy waiting on almost all filled tables with only 2 waiters but managed to get it done smoothly and were quite attentive.  Food was great and relatively cheap. We got a 20 piece, Squid and pork belly, dolsot bibimbap, and a spicy tofu soup. Chicken wings are absolutely huge and juicy but a bit too sweet in my opinion. Comes with side dishes as well, which is a plus! For our group of 6, this came out to $14 per person including tip, and we had more than enough food.  Don't forget to use the little check in coupon for macaroons! Our waiter was nice enough to bring us 2 plates of them.  TLDR; casual trendy place with decent quality food great for a younger group",

The squid comes with various dipping sauces and are really flavorful. It was excellent and definitely hit the spot. The staff is good and I have no complaints. The crown chicken dish costs 23.95 and is good for two very hungry people or three regular people. We recommend the supreme sauce for the chicken wings.  We also ordered the spicy beef tofu soup. Even though the soup had good flavor, the beef was over cooked in the soup.   Our last order was the bulgogi fried rice, which was excellent and seasoned nicely.",

The bulgogi is sweet and portion size is really decent.  The bulgolgi pizza wasn't that great though. Will not order that next time.   The best thing here is the fried chicken with the supreme sauce.

They had service buttons at every table, and we pressed ours twice before having to vocally calling the server over to get our check. She told us we should have pressed the button to call them, and we told her we did. Twice. We got our check, nothing discounted, and they offered us more water and told us they would remember our faces next time. Definitely wont be a next time.   Also, the food wasn't great.",

They even had a big sale on some of the higher quality meat options--traditional lamb shank was still amazing. I'd highly recommend this place, but make sure you are able to handle spice.  Kwan was an excellent server who gave many good recommendations. I will definitely come back to this location!",

The tables used to have a curtain that separated them from one another and I'm pretty sure it got annoying having to deal with them every night. There was also only one server the whole night so service was slow.  I initially stopped coming because their food was mediocre and the free shaved ice you get with your check in was just a bowl of solid ice.  Now, the tables are set up in a way that the servers and the customers are able to maneuver around easily. There's this button on the table that you press when you need service and it finally works!   My sister and I have been enjoying the chicken wings with supreme sauce and the half half pizza. There are about five side dishes served with whatever you order as well.  There is also more than one server working and the service is quick. They usually tell us to press the button for service but the servers still come to check up on us. I do like what Q Bistro is doing and I do hope that they continue to do even better from here.  **Update: I have tried the bulgogi fries recently and the pot sticker appetizers and they're super good. Also, don't be afraid to ask for more side dishes, the employees are more than happy to bring you more :-)",

A single whole chicken is definitely enough for a party of 2.    You'll want to get some sides too - bulgogi fried rice is my recommendation.  The bonchon they provide too is definitely top notch - I loved all the ones I got!  Specifically the fish tofu - mmmmmmmm....  And if you're into soju too, they have a good selection.  I tried it for the very first time - maybe not my thing, but the flavored ones seemed intriguing.  We didn't try it, but you can also do the karaoke bar and order food from the kitchen too.  Shame I missed it, but it's an option, which is def very cool.",

Our waiter was professional and brought our food out quickly. I also love the fact that its open late for late night talks and munchies.

    "text": "Warning: PARKING IS HARD TO FIND!!!  I came here with a party of 6 people, upon walking in we were instantly greeted by the host and brought to our table. She quickly brought out two pitchers of water for us and asked if there were any other drinks we'd like. They have the buy 2, get 1 free deal so we'd thought we'd get Soju!!! Within the next 10 minutes she came out with the drinks and took our order. We waited for about 20 minutes for our food, it didn't feel like a long time just because we were drinking but we finished the three Soju bottles before she came out with our food.  We got the following:  Drinks -  Fountain drink  Lemonade ($3)  Buy 2, get 1 free Soju deal Peach Soju ($11) Grapefruit Soju ($11) Citron Soju (Free)  Buy 2, get 1 free Rita deal 2 Starshine Rita ($20), $10 each Corona Rita ($10)  Food - 2 LA Kalbi ($30), $15 each Corn Cheese ($6) Bulgogi Fried Rice ($9) 2 Spicy Tofu Soup ($19), $9.50 each Bulgogi Fries ($11) Seared Brisket ($16)  They charged us an automatic 18% gratuity fee so our bill roughly came out to $171 with tax and tip.   The Soju was really good, my favorite was the Peach then the Grapefruit, and lastly the Citron. It is pretty strong in my opinion as well, and three bottles divided evenly with six people was more than enough. The Starshine Rita looked really good, it was mixed with Mike's Hard and a mango slushee. As for our food when it came out the portioning was pretty descent. I personally had bulgogi fried rice and I couldn't finish it but my friend got a beef brisket and the portioning looked like the LA kalbi my other friend got. The brisket was more expensive than the kalbi and I don't think the price matched the portioning for that, plus they only give you one bowl of rice for your entire entree. Also, I couldn't add extra protein to my fried rice, they had shrimp fried rice and I asked if I could mix both shrimp and bulgogi but our server said no. On top of that when my friend ordered Lemonade or server said they don't have that but we showed her the menu and it stated there was indeed Lemonade... she had to double check with other servers. I guess she was new but our server was nice except it was a bit frustrating that she didn't know the drink/ food items on the menu. She didn't even know the Soju was a buy 2, get 1 free deal, and there was a huge sign hanging next to our table stating the deal... that was the only issue. Other than that the food was good. This is a good place for big groups and dates with your significant other.",

We were the first ones there and were promptly seated and given water glasses, and a fancy bottle of water to fill our glasses with.   My review will be consistent w/ the other yelpers:  1. Unlimited Side dishes were free (and yum)- daikon, glass noodles, pasta salad... 2. Dolsat Bimbimbab was yum 3. Supreme & soy chicken wings were yum and remained hot. Crunchy, saucy, sticky yummy wings! 4. Free shaved ice (w/Yelp checkin) w/strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon and large enough to share. 5. Service was prompt & polite.   My only complaint was seeing the servers eating and drinking in the front. Other than that, I'd still eat here!",

They could have just anticipated another table coming in and moved the table before we sat down (just using common sense).  Also, instead of communicating that soups were on a delay and to be wary of ordering it.. it just never came out. The only reason I dine at Korean restaurants is really for soup (why else?), but I rather leave without it than sit there a minute longer for an underwhelming payoff. Reminding the kitchen is one thing, but you have to communicate with the guests promptly.   For Korean food just go to hobak, hwaro, magal, djk, or e-jo. If you're hanging in the plaza like we were just skip Korean altogether and go to district 1 (oxtail soup), chada (Thai curry), or hachi (Japanese tapas and sashimi).",

    "text": "Oh my gosh, my friends could not love this place more. We accidentally walked into their karaoke right next door. Great concept, 'cause who doesn't get hungry after singing their heart out? AND great fun vibe to stay into the wee hours of the night laughing, eating, drinking. For our girls night we watched a magic show on the strip and ended up here which became the best decision of the night. We ordered budae jjigae (army soup), seafood pancake, 1/2 bulgolgi 1/2 sweet potato pizza, and the best fried chicken wings. Suffice to say, we ordered WAY too much for us four girls, but we strong women and carried our weight. Portions were generous and the consensus vote of our favorite dish was the fried chicken. But honestly, everything was delicious. We sat in a tin constructed curve ceiling booth (think Relient K forget and not slow down album cover) with hipster low hanging lights and a pallet hooked on the wall as decor. How fun is this place? 10/10. Will definitely be back!! Delicious food, friendly and attentive service!",

My review thought is more for the service, or lack there of. We were blatantly ignored. Never checked on once, nor asked if we needed refills. Everyone that came in after us was taken care of before us and finished before us. We waited for over 10 min before they even acknowledged us wanting the check. We rang the bell on the table TWICE and no one stopped by. When we finally flagged our server down, she suggested us using the bell to which we responded we had twice. She gave us a half assed apology. And only after we mentioned we were being treated unfairly. I hate to say it but we were the only white customers there and watching everyone else being taken care of before us (who were not) leads me to believe we were discriminated against. I am beyond disappointed. I am not one to leave negative reviews for places because I know that everyone's experiences vary. But this was downright rude. After seeing how upset we were, the server responded \"I'll remember your faces the next time you come\" Unfortunately, that is not how you make up a horrible experience with customers. We won't be back ever.",

A Ten piece order of wings is a LOT!  The decor and food of this place are for young folks. So if you're pushing 40, this place might not be for you unless you're young at heart and you eat like it.   For the rest of us adults who are watching our sodium levels, maybe not.  However, service is great and the food is great. Meal prep times are reasonable. Come here if you're with a group of 4 or more and you want to order a lot of stuff for sharing.  Wings, Pizza, Kim Bop, dokbokgi, and various snack-type dishes.  Made well, priced decent.  Wings are juicy. But if you're not into party food, this place is not for you. I won't be back often because it's so unhealthy but it still deserves 5 stars",

I had such a craving for Korean Style fried chicken and for some reason I had no idea my favorite Karaoke Spot neighbors their little bistro serving new style Korean foods (cheesy corn) and Korean classics and favorites   Needless to say I got the Whole Family chicken half with Supreme Sauce and half original. The supreme sauce is the way to go! I like a good mix of both but it was so yummy !!   The staff is super polite and efficient. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be really enjoying their different varieties of late night Korean goodies.   I also ordered the spicy Tofu soup. It was actually pretty good. It's a blandish type of soup where the flavor of the ingredients are supposed to be the Star with the nice spicy smooth broth to accompany them.   I'm very picky with Kimchi so I never review them based upon that. I took a bite and not good imo but I have not found 1 decent kimchi in Vegas.   That being said I loved loved loved this chicken and everything else. An ample amount of rice and the other sides were tasty. They give you traditional little turnips cubed and pickled sweetly with a slight hint of salt.   I recommend anyone and everyone to try them out! They are open Super late too!",

    "text": "This plaza always has pretty good eats, but I'm rarely in the mood for Korean. Q gets away from the typical BBQ menu, instead offering various takes on fried chicken (wings, drums, and popcorn style), along with some traditional soups, noodle and rice dishes, and of course, the banchan.  DOLSOT BIBIMBAP: Huge portion, definitely a comfort-food dish. The mix was extremely light on meat, with a bit more veggies, and mostly a ton of rice. Had to ask for sesame oil and sriracha to kick it up from a bland baseline, but the crunchy rice and variety of veggies made it a successful dish for me. SOY GARLIC WINGS: The wings here are huge, on par with drumsticks elsewhere, and coated in a thick crust topped with a sticky sauce. The flavor seemed to be more of a sweet and sour, or a honey-based sauce, and there were no notes of garlic. Though flavors weren't what we expected, the dish was still good, and we barely put a dent in the order. LEMON PEPPER POPCORN CHICKEN: Listed separately from the other chicken dishes, this one comes topped with a shredded green onion salad and lemon wedges, with a cold, acidic dipping sauce. This was perhaps my favorite mix of flavors at the table, as I especially enjoy green onion. The salad served to keep this fried dish on the lighter side. I do wish the dipping sauce were heated, as the coldness was a bit of an abrupt interruption to the other ingredients.   Each dish had some hits and misses about it, but overall it's a place I'd recommend. Heads up that the service uses those little doorbell buttons for each table, which I don't really care for. The decor is an odd mishmash of styles, but I really enjoy the bubble-light chandelier that is the focal point of the dining room. Prices are about on par with $10/meal and portions are more than generous.  Don't forget to use your Yelp check-in offer for a free shaved ice dessert! I'll have to use mine another time, as I was far too full for dessert.",

This place is by district one and laid out so cute and romantic with little curtains separating tables for privacy. There is also the coolest graffiti on the walls, and A BUZZER ON THE TABLE TO GET THE WAITERS ATTENTION!!!!  The buzzer was a shocker... It was encouraged but I only had to use it once! Our waiter was seriously the best. He gave us a new water carafe everytime it was emptied, and made sure everything was all good. My only complaint is that the food took awhile but it is understandable since IT WAS SO EFFING GOOD  Their prices are so reasonable and their alcohol is priced TOO well. We got the bulgogi pizza which is to die for, potstickers, seafood tofu soup, and dol sot bimbap. Please see pics to actually feel my excitement!",

Located on Jones and Spring Mountain in the middle of a strip mall full of other asian restaurants and karaoke bars.    The sign above the door says there's no MSG.  They might be right, but the flavor was too good to be True.  Most restaurants that don't use MSG in their food are very bland in flavor, but this place was excellent.   The inside was dark and quite chic.  The had pop and R&B music going with some K-pop music videos on TV.  Free shaved ice with check in and the shaved ice is shareable between about 4 people.    Appetizers include korean stir fry noodles (my fave) with kimchee (spicier than kimchee in other places), fish cake, and I can't remember what the 4th appetizer was.  Our orders took a while to come out, so we probably had 2-3 servings of appetizers.    We ordered the bulgogi, stir fried squid and pork belly, pan seared brisket, and kimchee soup.  The bulgogi was delicious, but the portion was smaller than most places.  It was only good enough for one person.  If you don't have much of an appetite, maybe 2.  Nonethless, the flavor with the onions was sweet and savory.   The kimchee soup was very spicy (which I like).  I was hoping for more slices of pork.  There was very little of it.  It was very rich in spiciness and flavor.  One of the best kimchee soups I've tasted.   Then there's the pan seared brisket.  Good with the 2 sauces they give you.  This one is a shareable portion for 2 people.    Even though our order took longer than expected, the servers were very friendly and accomodating.  They let us know exactly by the minute how long our food was going to take and brought out extra servings of appetizers.  I really like the stir fried noodles.   I would definitely go back here.  I'm hoping that my food won't take so long to come out next time.",

The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10!

    "text": "THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Honestly, it hurts me to write this. I've been coming to Q Bistro for like 3 years and I love their food.  This review is purely on the staff and the customer service, which is normally good.  My boyfriend and I came in and it was busy, that's fine. They offered us a middle table but it's a huge table and we didn't feel right taking it as it was big enough for 8 people. We said we would wait for a smaller table or a booth. So we waited for 20 min and one of the waitresses asked us if we wanted a booth or a table. I said preferably I want a booth but if a small table is all they have, that's fine too.  A party leaves a booth and they started cleaning it. My boyfriend and I started getting ready to get up and move over to the booth, but instead a giant group of people that were ALREADY SEATED were moved into this booth. Like wtf?? We waited 30 min and they already had their food but they move them to a booth?? Another 10 min goes by and a waiter says another booth is being cleaned and it will be ready in 2 min. Cool. We waited AGAIN.  Finally they come to seat us and we start trying to walk back to the now clean booth, and they said no, we're going to be seated at a small corner table.  Again, wtf? We asked for a booth if it's available and a small table if it wasn't, and we were already told we were getting the booth. So I said to the same waiter, \"I thought we were getting the booth?\" Only to be completely ignored. And when I say completely ignored, they took another 10 min to even take our order.   The food is the only reason I can give 2 stars at most. The food to me is 5 star, but the customer service is a 1. I'm so disappointed and idk if I'll be coming back for awhile.",

We've ordered their fried chicken, bulgogi fries, bulgogi pizza, and sweet potato pizza. Overall, everything is really tasty. The sauce on the fried chicken is perfect - not super sweet and allows the chicken to stay crispy while you eat it. It also comes out piping hot which is great. When we ordered the chicken for takeout, they threw in some side dishes for us for free even though they usually don't do that for takeout orders. Super nice! The flavors of the pizza are really good, but I wish the crust was better. The crusts almost taste stale and I usually never leave crust behind, but I don't feel obligated to eat theirs. However, I think everyone needs to try sweet potato pizza. I had sweet potato pizza for the first time in Korea last June and it blew my mind. I'm so happy I can satisfy my craving here. The bulgogi fries are REALLY big and are honestly only good if you can eat them in one sitting (like all fries, really). I haven't experienced their karaoke yet, but the food is good!",

My cousin and brother ordered beer and hot sake since it was buy one get one for 50% during their happy hour from 4pm-9pm. We ended up ordering their chicken wings (supreme & soy garlic), kimchi fried rice, and bulgogi. They were good, but not the best.   When you check in for the first time, you get a free shaved ice per table, which is really good. And when you write a review, you'll get a free cold sake.",

They have alot of the usual Asian restaurant fare. Noodles, tofu, marinated meats. And some unusual ones. But, I think, the real star of this cafe is the Korean fried chicken. The \"Single\" plate of fried chicken comes with a side of salad. But who cares about the salad?! If you've ever heard about Korean fried chicken and was wondering what all the hoohaa was about, then give their fried chicken a try. It'll blow your face off.",

I think everyone hyped up the food too much. We ordered the hamburger steak, bulgogi pizza and spicy bulgogi. The hamburger steak tasted like meat loaf. And they kind of over did the pizza. The calamari was pretty good though nice and crispy, it wasn't chewy at all.  Maybe next time we will try something different and get more alcohol.",

The hot and spicy wasn't really spicy at all - I would definitely go with garlic soy again and maybe a different flavor. We also ordered the sweet potato pizza - different, but SO good! They had a buy one get one free soju, so why not :3 ? There were also a good amount of side dishes, ranging from japchae, to kimchi, to hot dogs (which was our least favorite). The waitress was really nice, checked up on us often, and even refilled whichever side dishes we wanted!   One of the things I really appreciated about this place was the table bells to call your waiter/waitress if you ever needed anything ~  True, this place is '$$', but for the amount of food you get, I think it's justifiable to be considered '$'.

We had just returned from Seoul so we were interested in trying some Kimchee and whatever dishes we saw from Yelp.   Everything was fine,  we had some spicy tofu and beef soup.  Waitress was very nice who seated us, excellent table skills, but the waiter who also helps needs work.  They also had fairly loud rap music for background,  and since there was no one there we asked if they could turn it down.  The waitress did, and then the waiter adjusted it back up again.  Prices were very affordable,  and food overall was good.  My suggestion for the restaurant owner is change the music, turn it down, and train your wait staff how to attend a table properly.",

In terms of spice, the hot and spicy was pretty mild when it comes to Asian spice. I guess it's toned down to meet everybody's needs.   We also ordered the dukkbokki with ramen noodles and cheese, and that was alright. Maybe like a 3/5 stars since the rice cakes could have been cooked more and the sauce thicker and more flavorful.   The fried chicken was slightly on the heavier side (in terms of the sauce), but it was very good and juicy on the inside. Nowhere near the best fried chicken I had but it's probably one of the better ones in Las Vegas. I do have high standards for fried chicken since I was in Korea a few months back, lived in NYC for 4 years, and currently live in a highly korean-populated area where they have really good fried chicken on the east coast.   If I'm craving fried chicken in Las Vegas I would come back here and maybe try some of their other menu items and see what else I can nibble on at night.",

We arrive and they received the order but did not tell the kitchen! So we had to wait another half hour for 20 wings, bulgogi fried rice and fried chicken gizzards. The wings were supposed to be 10 supreme and 10 spicy. Neither box was marked so they were both the same! So much sauce drenched over them, and the sauce wasn't even good... The fried rice had an over medium egg on it that was rubbery and old. Fried rice was super salty. The chicken gizzards were way over cooked and there was way more jalapenos and onions than actual chicken gizzards in the order! They gave us some sides which included some nasty Vienna sausages....really? Wtf was that?!?! Do not waste your time or money here. Service is awful, food is awful. Waste of $50! And we ended up ordering pizza anyway!",

We ordered Bibimbap, Bulgogi with white rice, and Potstickers. A few minutes later we were served an array of small bowls of various Korean (and 1 not so Korean) side dish appetizers. All of these were good in their own way =)  We received our main meals and they were all freshly hot, even sizzling! The Bulgogi surpassed my expectations and the other food was delicious as well.

Please be aware that even tho they say the budae jjigae serves two, it could easily serve three, if not four! We also ordered the mini corn dogs (equally delicious and super crispy, no complaints), sand side of cheese cream corn. We received banchans which I loved that they refilled them without extra costs. The food was delicious. The budae jjigae came with spam, hot dogs, bacon/pork slices, noodles and assortment of veggies including kimchi. Hands down, would come back!",

The parking are so limited, I had to park elsewhere. Located next to Karaoke Q studio. The restaurant seems very casual and laid back. I ordered their fried chicken with Supreme sauce ( some sort of Korean sauce and little spicy) and also got their chicken wings with soy garlic sauce. They came with the side dishes: cole slaw and pickled radish. Seriously I am so glad these chicken wings are so huge and juicy! It is flavorful and has a nice crisp to it. It came out to be less than $24 and there was lot of leftover.  Their menu has many interesting dishes I want to come back for. Also, I believe they do deliver food to the karaoke right next door.",

Their portions are generous, the cuts of meat are high quality and the flavors are spot on! It satisfies our Korean meat cravings! We ordered the hot and spicy and soy garlic wings last time. The batter stays super crunchy even after soaking in the sauce and sitting in an uber for 15 minutes! Both sauces were a bit too sweet for my liking but if you like sweet sauces these are for you. We're both ecstatic that we can order delivery from Q Bistro.",

    "text": "I've come here on several occasions and this place has one of the best Korean foods in town.   The menu has a lot of options from chicken and pizza to Korean soups and bibimbap. The seating consists of tables and booths. The decorations are really cute and trendy and they also have call bells. They play K-pop music and it really makes me feel as if this was a restaurant in Korea. Overall, I find the atmosphere very chill and unique.   They don't allow reservations for the booths so when I came in, they were all packed and filled. However, I waited about an hour to come back and get a booth. The workers seated us immediately. After a while, they never checked on us to take our orders although we rang the call bell. We had to ring it a couple of times for them to take our order. Since it was busy, the service felt rushed. I ordered the Calamari and Cheese sticks for appetizers. We also got the Tonkatsu and the Supreme Korean Fried Chicken. They came with the appetizers pretty quickly but we had to wait longer than usual for the Tonkatsu and Chicken. Once the chicken finally came out, we realized they messed up our order because it was supposed to be Supreme and not the Soy Garlic. We let them know and they kindly remade the order although it took another 10-15 minutes. I usually don't have many issues with their service but today was just one of those times and I understand that.   I think the Supreme Korean Fried Chicken is a must try, it never failed me and it's overall really good and flavorful. I really loved the appetizers as well!! The Tonkatsu tasted dried up and the cheese also seemed like it's been on there for a long time. The thing about Q is that their portions are really big so I recommend going with a group of 4+ if you're planning to order a lot. Since I only came with one other person, I ended up taking a lot of it for to-go. Overall, I recommend this place because the food is pretty good and they have various options you can choose from.",

This is the place you bring your friends for a drink and Korean bar food.  I give Q Bistro much praise because the food is always solid. The chicken wings are overrated but they are overrated for a reason! The only other place that had decent wings was Bazic/a18 which aren't open anymore. I always get half plain and half marinated and it never disappoints. If you're craving for soup, the budae jigae is my favorite. Perfect for sharing and it goes so well with some beer or soju.  Ah yes, the drinks :) Totally dig the buy 2 get 1 free beer promo they have going on right now. They have a variety of drinks on their menu and the yogurt soju is good if you have girls that prefer something fruity.  Last but not least the atmosphere is spot on. I'm not a total fan of their recent renovation because it's brighter than what it used to be but you still get that bar-atmosphere you will find in authentic places from the streets of Seoul. Everyone there is having a good time and laughing, talking, taking selfies and just enjoying life. The fact that it's right next to a karaoke, billiards and pc cafe you can probably spend 3 days around the area without running out of things to do.  Huge fan of this place. Even with the recent addition of dozens and dozens of restaurants in the Chinatown area, it's still holds up as King in my books.",

The bulgogi pizza tastes like tombstone frozen pizza with extremely dry bulgogi on it. The bulgogi is like tasteless sausage basically, no sweetness or tenderness like actual bulgogi. The wings were good though. The wings and the place's booths / atmosphere were really nice, but the service and other food was below average.   Our waiter had a rude attitude. Once we started he had never returned, each time we needed water or anything, we had to walk up to him. He was sitting at another table in the restaurant, chatting with friends as if he were on break the whole time. We had 3 people and on3 bottle of water so we needed it filled 4 times and we had to physically get him each time, to a point where I almost went to the kitchen to grab it myself. When we started ordering we picked 2 things and said we'll order more after we decide more. He said okay and disappeared. Then when we tried to order something else, he said they were out of everything. Kitchen closed. 40 minutes early- really? And if they knew we were only ordering starters why wouldn't they warn us when their kitchen was closing?    The best part is at the end, he ran out and demanded a tip. After treating us like we weren't there. We had to go up and ask for everything. I hope the management has time to have a talk with this guy.  UPDATE: Giving another star. The manager, Jin, reached out to me and personally apologized for our server's behavior and offered us a free pizza next time we come in. My family isn't too eager to come back anytime soon, but I appreciate the apology so one day we will try again. Hopefully not with the same server, lol. By the way the wings were delicious, very meaty and flavorful.",

The water is cute, it comes in a large glass jar.   There is a large menu with choices that range from fusion foods to Korean dishes. We always order chicken. The supreme and soy garlic are our two favorite sauces for the chicken. You can always ask for the sauce on the side. We also tried their kimbab, the shrimp one is the best, so try that one out. Their bulgogi and bacon/potato pizza are really good too, but I wish the crust tasted a little bit better. The toppings are definitely what makes the pizza stand out.   I'm not really sure what comes with the side dishes, but so far we've always gotten them. The side dishes are really good. I enjoy eating the fish cakes a lot. They change everyday so it never gets boring. Plus there are free refills on all the sides!   This place is definitely worth a try. I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Experience:  Came with about 8 folks on a Wed at 6pm. I've been to the Karaoke side, but this is my first time eating here.   Facility:  it was a small place, dimly lit with modern Asian decor. One of the reasons I am marking this review down is because it was HOT in there!!!  We asked them to reposition the fan to face us, but it barely helped. People literally had sweat running down their face. It was so hot and uncomfortable, we ended up cutting the dinner short, and we normally hang out and talk and have drinks. Some of use moved to another bar to have our social time because it was just too uncomfortable to stay there. The management needs to understand, the money they are saving on A/C, they are losing on business. No one wants to sit in a restaurant all hot and sweaty.   Service:  The service was ok. We ordered a lot of finger food, so the one chinchsy see-through napkin on the table was sad. Of course we had to ask for more. Isn't it nice when the waitstaff predicts your needs. Maybe it's cheap management trying to save a buck again. Anyway, It was nice they have \"doorbells\" on the table, so you could get the server's attention.  The other issue is they served the draft beers with a huge amount of head on them. I asked to pour a little off and add some more beer, and then they tried to hold everyone's beers to let the head go down, so it would take 15min to get a beer. Someone needs to teach them the art of tilting a glass or over-pour.   Food:  I enjoyed the food. It wasn't the best Korean food in town, but it was good. There were a lot of American dishes or twists on the menu too.  Kalbi - 3.5/5 - the Kalbi was good and served on a sizzling plate of onions, with a side of white rice. Good flavor, but kinda seemed a little pricey at $15 a plate.  Cheese corn - 5/5 - Everyone at our table kept asking, is it just cheese and corn...yes, it was. But considering I love corn and I love cheese, I loved this dish!  French Fries - 5/5 - I tasted someone else's and they were really good. They were hot, crispy and a nice flavor.  Pork Hocks - 3/5 - I tasted this too. It was a pretty big portion.  It was ok. Just tasted like pork. It's served on a platter to make lettuce rolls outta it with accoutrements such as such, garlic cloves and jalapenos.  Pork belly and squid - 4/5 - again, another dish I just tasted. It had a really good flavored sauce that was spicy with a slight sweet flavor. It was a nice size portion too.   Overall: if they could lower the A/C temp to a comfortable temp, I would come back. The food was good, the service was good enough, but it was just too damn hot!",

I took it back to my hotel thinking maybe I'd like it after I got drunk. Nahp :(, first time I threw away a whole pizza between 4 ppl.   Wings were overwhelming, too much sauce that tasted like it was straight up out the bottle. It tasted like Chinese fast food orange chicken.   Fries were bomb! It tasted really fresh, seasoned perfectly, with the perfect crunch.   An hour into eating we check up on the bulgogi, turns out our waiter never put it in. We had to cancel since they were closing up, but they gave us 4 free sodas. I thought that was a very nice gesture.   All the homies from Cali, avoid this place. It's not like LA/OC/SF food, you will be disappointed.",

You can half the flavors. I like soy garlic and supreme. Supposed to be spicy but my boyfriend said it isn't. Pizza- your usual Korean toppings and style. I like the sweet potato. But who doesn't love sweet potato. Its kinda pricey though for the size. I think pizza was the only pricey thing. Everything is a good size for the cost. I came with a group of 8 and everyone was stuffed bill spilt with everyone including tip was only $20 each. We got folks that eat a lot.  Service was on point. They even have the buzzers to call for a waiter. (these buzzer are typical at any Korean restaurant in CA- only spot I've see here in las vegas) LOVE IT. Although I have embarrassed myself and accidentally kept hitting it when I was leaning against the table.  Watch them elbows!!  Parking --- it located in a very busy plaza, so it make be difficult to find a spot.  Oh tip on the check-in deal - only 1 person can get the free drink per table/bill. I know bummer, my friends thought everyone can use it but it was just 1.",

I also love that you can order from pretty much the same menu when you go to Q Karaoke next door since they share a kitchen. My favorite thing to get here is the Dolsot Bibimbap, which is served in a hot stone pot. It's super sizzle-y and I love that the rice at the bottom gets cooked to a crisp as it sits in the pot. Would give it 5 stars but the service has been kind of slow in my recent experiences.",

The chicken wings come with a sweet and spicy candy coating sauce that was really good.  I'm glad the wings comes with a coleslaw because you need something to cut the sweet. Would have been nice if the salad was sour and tangy instead. For $11, the wings were quite large. I was basically full sharing the wings before eating the Bulgogi that I also ordered. Bulgogi meat was flavorful and tender.  Fair value for the price for the large portions.  Overall glad to have discovered it.  Thanks yelp!",

Service: Service is always attentive and friendly when I am here. If it by chance is not attentive a button is provided to grab the attention of the staff, but BEWARE as it rings like a doorbell throughout the entire restaurant.  Food: I have loved most of the things I have tried here! Stand outs would be the pork belly, soondubu, cheese tonkatsu and fried rice. The banchan is always delicious as well, although I always have to ask for kimchi (possibly because I am not Korean?).  Prices: Very reasonable for the portion sizes which I feel should always be shared as family style. You can easily feed 3 for around $30 and to top it off beers (all beers so this includes imports) and flavored sojus are buy 2 get 1 free!",

Very crunchy on the outside even with the sauce all over it.   On the inside the decor was nice with k-pop and videos playing in the wall. The prices for food was pretty good also. It was dead around midnight on a Tuesday. This place is catered to late drinker and food bar food I felt. They did have like order two drinks get one free if I remember.

    "text": "Despite the horrible parking lot, food is consistently good here!! I've been here 3 times and gotten food to go once and they have yet to mess anything up. Definitely a lot closer than driving to bonchon.   I was in a party of 3 and we were greeted and seated promptly in a booth. Their booths are pretty large and can seat 6, maybe 8. They have 4 booths and quite a few tables that can accommodate larger parties.  Korean music was playing but not too loud with the Music video projected on the wall. Cute decor with hanging lights. Clean bathrooms!  Condiments are on the table. They give you a water pitcher so you don't need to keep waving the server over for refills.   There's a board of soju flavors on the wAlls on the booths. Buy 2, get one free! We got yogurt, mango and pineapple (or peach) last time!  Yogurt was the best one. Also, beers, soju, sake and cocktails are buy 2 get one free!  We were told the supreme (medium spicy) and soy garlic were the best flavors so that's what we went with. Note: you can only order half and half sauces for the 20 piece OR the family Whole chicken ($21). GET THE SUPREME AND SOY GARLIC SAUCE!!! You won't regret it! The supreme was a bit spicy for me but I liked it more than the soy garlic, which I found to be a bit on the sweet side. The supreme chicken wings were a bit too saucy but I just rubbed off the excess sauce on my plate. One thing that I did not like was that the chicken wings came out warm and not piping hot. Also, I would recommend that they provide a small bucket for the bones like other places.  3/5 The bulgogi kimbab (think of Korean sushi with bulgogi and veggies) had fresh veggies and was pretty good. I thought it would be a small portion for $6 but it was big!  5/5 We also ordered the bulgogi fried rice ($9). There was corn, bell peppers, a fried egg on top and onions. Bulgogi was well seasoned. The rice had sort of a charbroiled taste to it which was surprisingly pleasant.   Banchan included macaroni salad, pickled radish, kimchi, fishcake and spinach (I could be wrong about this last one). Fishcake was decent. My sister raved about the macaroni salad but I thought it was just ok. But the side dishes are complimentary and refillable. Kimchi was super fermented, therefore super sour. I like my kimchi kind of fresh and not super fermented so I didn't enjoy it.   My friends and I definitely went overboard with the ordering but the atmosphere was good and we really enjoyed the soju! It's a chill environment and doesn't get too loud.   When our food took longer than usual, the server came out and apologized to us but the wait wasn't too bad.",

Not greasy and they have some sort of Parmesan garlic seasoning. So addicting!  Bulgogi pizza - Super cheesy and the bulgogi was delicious but we may pass on it next time. We're not a fan of sweet pizza.  This restaurant is up there with our favorites to eat at in Vegas. Seriously, bomb.",

Their food presentation is what I have to mention and also a plus. Even though they're open really late, the staff is always welcoming, considerate, and friendly. By far most, it's my favorite go-to spot for late dinner and to end the night when everything else is close. It's always a nice time especially with the K-Pop environment.",

I've found that the cut of meat here is also a higher quality - it's not the super think beef that overcooks and dries out. The cut is thicker and remains tender and juicy.   I will definitely keep this place on the list of go-to's when I'm back in Vegas for visits.   The decor was clean and well done. They have a large tv playing K-pop in the background - maybe 2 tv's, if I'm remembering correctly.",

    "text": "Q Bistro is at the top of our list of favorite Korean restaurants, on heavy rotation! We love this place! There's a handful of Korean restaurants in Las Vegas, but no one hooks it up like Q bistro. They are owned by Karaoke Q Studio right next door, but don't share the same entrance.   The food is always very flavorful and the service is always wonderful! There is also a table buzzer (like a doorbell but on the table), which you can press to call their attention whenever you need something. They also bring out a complimentary selection of their delicious rotating banchan (side dishes) and everything is always seasoned perfectly and pairs great with all of the dishes. Some of the banchan items we tried: pickled daikon, kimchi, japchae (clear sweet potato noodles), seasoned potatoes, fish cake, potato salad, mac salad, pickled bean sprouts, etc. All so tasty! They are always happy to refill your side dishes as you request.  Here's what we've tried:  * Soondubu $9 - Q's version offers a generous sized clay pot, filled with soft tofu and a fair amount of protein of your choice. My favorite combination is spicy bulgogi (marinated beef) and add mushroom for $1 more. The broth is bubbling hot, flavorful and extremely satisfying. The spicy level is never too hot for us to enjoy, it's actually perfect for us! (We like spice) Rated: 5/5  * Dol Sot Bibimbap $10 - This is the tastiest version I've tried in Las Vegas! It's traditionally served in a hot stone pot with veggies, bulgogi (marinated beef) and a fried egg. Let it sit a bit before you start mixing it all up, so that the rice has a chance to get crispy! Also, be careful while eating it, the dish stays scalding hot for a while. It's an explosion of flavor and texture! They also provide red spicy sauce on the side so you can kick up the spiciness of the dish if you wish. So delicious! Rated: 5/5  * Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) 10 pieces for $10 - We tried the \"supreme sauce\" which is a delicious balance between sweet, salty and spicy. We love spice, but we didn't think it was too spicy. Plus the batter is super airy and crispy! Rated: 5/5  * Seafood pancake $12 - Large with perfectly crisp edges, but it's rather doughy. The seafood isn't too generous on this one, but the flavor is great! Rated: 4/5  * Bulgogi $14 - A classic dish of marinated thinly sliced beef served with onions on a sizzling platter. Their version tasted fine, maybe not the best I've had but you can't go wrong with it. Rated: 4/5  This is the first place that comes to mind when we want to satisfy our Korean cuisine cravings. The pricing is fair for the amount of food that you receive, on top of the complimentary side dishes offered! We always leave happy!  PRO TIP: Don't forget to check-in on yelp, show your server and receive a free small sized \"shaved ice\" dessert topped with ice cream, corn flakes, condense milk and fruit!",

They have a pretty vast menu that caters to different taste buds. If you have a picky eater who isn't sure about Korean food, Q is a good place to start.   As noted earlier, Q's menu is pretty large. It includes items such as Korean fried chicken, ramen, pizza, and more traditional fare such as bibimbap. Whenever we come here, we normally order a platter of Korean fried chicken to share. There are different sauces to choose from, but our favorite is the supreme: it's sweet but also has a spicy kick. I've also tried their bulgogi pizza, tofu salad, spicy ramen, and cheesy corn, among others. Everything has been delicious.   In traditional Korean style, your meal is accompanied by banchan (side dishes) such as macaroni salad, pickled radish, salad, kimchi, and my favorite: gamjajorim, which is composed of potatoes in a sweet sauce.  The atmosphere is very chill and seating consists of tables and booths. They are ready to accommodate large parties if that's your thing. There are Kpop music videos playing and the choice of decor is very cute. Service is quick and friendly, but if you're one who likes prompt service, every table has a call bell, which you can press to get the host's attention instead of trying to flag them down.  Q is a great place with an extensive menu and unique atmosphere. I've had many great foods, laughs, and good times there. I will definitely come back in the future to try more of their menu. They also have karaoke next door, which is fun.",

    "text": "Want Korean fried chicken...come here!  Want soft tofu soup...come here! Want something Korean? JUST COME HERE!! They have almost everything that you would want which is so convenient cause not everyone wants to eat the same thing. Especially for my family of 6, this works out perfectly.  Now what made me want to come here initially though was their kfc. I was on a hunt for some good kfc and Yelp led me here. So far, they beat the other Korean fried chickens I've tried here in Vegas. They're crispy on the outside but moist on the inside and full of flavor.  I personally prefer no sauce but if you do decide to go with a sauce, the soy garlic and/or supreme are both good choices.  Other great items to try is their soft tofu soup, army stew, and bibimbap.  Q Bistro is located at the corner of Jones and Spring Mountain and the center itself is pretty busy and parking can be a hot mess so be prepared.  But besides the parking, no complaints here.  We've been here a handful of times already and I highly recommend you try them out.",

    "text": "After experiencing Q in more ways I can recommend it as a hang out or date night spot. Karaoke is a blast and a worthwhile experience. They have deals at slower times, so check it out. Plus drinks are always buy 2 get 1. So if drinking and singing sounds appealing then you're looking at the right businesses to go to.  Food wise. The biminbap is amazing. A melody of flavors and some crispy rice on bottom = joy.   The biminbap here is authentic. Clean, healthy and flavorful. Just enough oil in the stone pot to crisp the rice. The portion is perfect and it even come with a side of soup.   Gimbap here is pretty damn good too. I like to get a roll or 2 or 3 to go for lunch the next day. 1-2 rolls at lunch and I'm contnet until evening.   The pizza is alright. Honestly it's an authentic Korean place with traditional and modern foods. Pizza isn't the strong suit here but it's alright. The kfc and wings are incredible so get those over pizza or get both.   They have lots of good beer, soju and makgeoli pairings. Wings, squid, dried fish and more.   So make a night out of it and experience a clip of Korean culture exported directly to Vegas.",

Making them even more addictive is addinthe corn cheese fondue to them. I saw this on Instagram and saw chicken wrapped in cheese and it makes you drool at the screen. I took my mom and she said not only are they great they taste better the next day. I also love the shrimp fried rice, which has corn in it,but it's a surprisingly welcomed addition. Once you start going to Q bistro you won't be able to stop going.",

    "text": "I could definitely QQ over not having come here sooner.  Q Bistro is a restaurant in the absurdly busy Spring Mountain Plaza, aka the plaza on Jones near Spring Mountain with District One, Chubby Cattle, Hachi, and sometimes impossible parking. I was very surprised and pleased to find plenty of parking spots on a Thursday weeknight, possibly because everybody was somewhere else to watch the season opener of the local NHL team. Next time, I doubt it'll be so easy.  The interior has that same streetside, wood and metal decor as so many other Korean spots. As I hinted earlier, it was to get some seats for myself and some friends. They seem to prefer seating everyone in relatively private booths. Along with the not-too-loud Korean music being played, this made us feel comfortable and relaxed enough to converse freely.  The menu is more extensive than I was led to believe by others Yelpers' photos, so perhaps Q Bistro has added more items recently. Certainly they have a wide variety of traditional dishes, but they also have fusion tendencies, which is where we wound up navigating to due to our group's less experienced makeup. By the way, the food came out quickly and in rapid succession.  Not to bury the lede further, but the chicken wings ($11.99 for 10) were the best part of the meal. First off, they're gigantic. They didn't stay crunchy for long due to being drowned in sauce, but the meat was juicy and seasoned sufficiently all the way through. The supreme sauce, which I'd chosen due to others' reviews, was sweet and mildly spicy as our server described. It somehow reminded me distinctly of duck a l'orange, even though I've only eaten that dish a couple or so times and in my younger, less Yelpy days. These might even be the best wings in town.  The Bulgogi French Fries ($11.99) had enough character between the cheese and the \"Q Salsa\" to cover for the not-so-crispy fries, but I wish that the beef was more of a traditional bulgogi than some thin beef that was just moist enough not to be mistaken for some sort of sweet Asian-style beef jerky. I wouldn't order this again at Q Bistro, but I could see myself digging in after a wild time at the adjacent / same-ownership Karaoke Q Studio.  The bulgogi pizza ($15.99, whether you do half/half or go al bulgogi) had the same beef and perhaps the same cheese, but the crust was forgettable and not the right kind of chewy. It reminded me of the new place at Fashion Show mall and others of cheap, possibly premade doughs. Stay away from the pizza here.  I did enjoy the complimentary banchan, although the side dishes presented here are perhaps the most American-friendly set I've seen anywhere. They didn't have kimchi or anything else fermented, but they had plenty of sweet items and a creamy pasta. The japchae (sweet potato glass noodles) was quite addictive though, albeit a little sweet. I also couldn't resist the crunchy pickled radish cubes.  The current Yelp check-in is a free 4 pc set of macarons ($6.99), likely limited to 1 per table. I tried the pistachio and raspberry. Both had reasonably acceptable chewy texture, although you won't mistake these for a proper patisserie's products. The raspberry flavor stood out more to me. This dessert is easily worth saving a bit of room if it's free, but is not worth paying for.  I'd love to come back to Q Bistro soon. More fried chicken will assuredly end up on my plate, and I'm curious about the more traditional Korean menu items as well.",

    "text": "Never knew Q Karaoke had a little cute restaurant next door. Due to an Instagram post, I found out they serve some really good looking Korean food. So I came around 10pm and ordered their Bulgogi Fried Rice. Being a Korean restaurant, they came with the side dishes: japchae, pickled veggies, Kim hi, and potato salad. Seriously those enough would fill me up already. However, I was waiting for the main dish.  The fried rice tasted really good! Definitely get this if you come. There was a lot of beef and veggies and it was seasoned and mix well together. The portion was a lot too, enough for me and my friend to share. It came with a fried egg on top, but I wished the yolk was more runny. The egg was cooked a bit too long and it took away that really nice ooze-y sexy yolk running down the rice moment.   I also order their Starshine Rita drink! The table next to us influenced me to order it. It came out in this huge cocktail fish bowl like glass with a whole bottle of Mike's Hard Mango Liquor on top upside down straight into the orange smoothie or slushie. It was very good, definitely get this as well if you're feeling like you need to let loose and treat yourself.    I also got 4 free mini macaroons with a Yelp check-in. However, there are reasons why some places give these freebies out and they are not always the greatest. This was one of them. Some of macaroons were pretty hard to bite down on and it was really sweet. Good thing I was craving something sweet after that entree. However, free food is free food what can you say?   Other that that, the atmosphere was nice. It wasn't busy when I got there. The girls working there were all nice. However, it looked like they had some technical problems with their sound system. They play pretty loud Kpop music there and during one moment, the music playing gave off this scratchy sound over the speakers and it got really annoying and bothersome. However, after that song was over, it got better. Maybe they fixed it? Or maybe it was that specific song? I don't know. Regardless, I still would come back again just to try their KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and Sweet Potato Pizza.",

We ordered the following for 5 people: 20 pc wing, 14-16 pc family chicken (2 whole chickens cut up), army soup, bulgogi fries, corn cheese, and pork belly appetizer.   The pork belly was so good! Seems like they were grilled as thick sliced, topped with chilis and then a sweet, salty soy sauce on top. The corn cheese was huge! I've been to places where the dish it was served in was a lot smaller compared to what we got. The bulgogi  fries were alright. It needed more bulgogi.  Their side dishes were probably the best side dishes I've ever had. It consisted of Kim chi, pickled radish, bomb ass jap chae, fish cakes, and fried/roasted potatoes. We had to request more of the jap chae because it was THAT good.   The army soup was also great. It stated that it feeds 2 but it would definitely feed more than 2 especially if you ordered additional foods.   Finally, the fried chicken... we tried the supreme (spicy&sweet) and soy garlic. The chicken was great! The batter is a little thicker than Bon Chon (this is my comparison and still my top choice for Korean fried chicken). It was unbelievably great cold when we came back at 3 am from the clubs.   I would definitely come back if were ever back in Vegas!",

    "text": "Honestly, my new favorite Korean spot!! What drew me to this place was the fried chicken. I've been searching for a Korean fried chicken place for quite a while since I tried a Korean joint near Anaheim. Stumbled across this place through a food blog and I'm glad I did. This place has for the crispiest, most delicious fried chicken wings I have ever eaten. I got the half and half wings. The flavors I got were supreme and soy garlic. And I can honestly say that I'm craving for more once I'm done with them. They serve great sides- Chap Jae, Kim chee, etc which I like and the icing on the cake is free macaroons when you check in there. Other than the fried chicken, there bibambap is huge for the money. I was able to try the octopus bibambap which was delicious. Don't hesitate to try this place out. I will definitely be back!",

The fried chicken has a crispy batter and full of flavor, the meat was tender and juicy...just fantastic.  I didn't care for the slaw.  However, I did eat the fried chicken with the banchans that were offer and I do like their kim chi.  We also ordered the nori app and I liked it with the dipping sauce.  The combination tofu stew was also delicious as well.  My toddler even got a Kool-Aid Jammers pouch drink, which I find it as a nice touch (kid-friendly).  The booth we sat at was huge and perfect for my toddler who cannot sit still.  The decor was cute as well.  Service was fantastic.  Yelp check in got us four macarons (deal is per table).",

You can get way much larger amount of Delicious, Sincere & Authentic Korean food at any other places! Even the food court at the Green Land Korean Market is way much better!  Plus it's tooo Loud!

The inside is a lot happier and divey than what is reflected on the outside (pretty much blacked walled, perhaps to keep cool from the Vegas sun).  I wanted to take my mom for some korean style fried chicken because she tried it in Cali with me and loved it, so I was glad that I was able to yelp something in Vegas to satisfy her cravings in her home town. This place was clean and had an interesting menu, including bulgogi pizza (which we didn't get a chance to try) and a few options for fried chicken, we got the garlic and spicy flavored and a soup and a bowl of bibimbap rice.  They were tasty, but service was slow, I found out later that they also cater to the next door karoke, which made sense now whey they were q bistro next to q karoke. :) So, maybe it's better to make a night out of it and enjoy some fried chicken as you sing away.",

The squid and pork belly dish had good flavors, spicy but not too much so for me, while it made my friend sweat bullets. The bulgogi was tough, gristly, and slightly too sweet. Of the 3 ban chan, the kimchi was quite good, the tempeh strips just so so, and the macaroni was the usual meh. I was born in Korea and personally, I've never understood the macaroni stuff....  The most notable thing was that our waitress, a middle-aged woman, was quite friendly and courteous, which is rare for a Korean restaurant. I don't know why, but Koreans generally don't give good service so it's always worth noting when you find it!",

I ordered the bulgogi pizza the last time I was there and let me tell you it's actually pretty bomb. I usually don't like lots of toppings on pizza but q bistro made it surprisingly work. They have lots of appetizers that I want to order but know I can't finish. I just want to try everything here to be honest. Their corn cheese is definitely my favorite from all the other places I ordered from. The service was on point and I loved the ambience of the place. Whenever you want to karaoke and have some great late night Korean food I suggest going to Q bistro.  Try the bulgogi pizza you won't regret it I promise you.",

The atmosphere is great and so is the aesthetic, however i find it annoyingly rude when we get chased down by an employee because we forgot to tip. Here is my thing, I ALWAYS tip. I understand that because these employees have crappy upper management who makes their employees rely most of their income off of tips, that its polite to tip, but ONE time in my 24 years of eating out I forget to tip because we have a fussy baby and I get embarrassed in public by an employee who chased us out of the store saying \"You forgot to tip, is there a reason why?\" Like how unbelievably unprofessional is that??? Now we look like a bunch of assholes who dont tip after a $50 meal. She didnt wanna stop us at the door, or ask when we paid, no, she had to run outside and yell that. Ridiculous. Could have recieved 5 stars but took 1 away just for that. Otherwise everything else was fantastic",

They have a button on a table if you need service , I wish Soyo had something like that.  The food was very flavorful. Although pricey at the end , we were able to get a decent amount of food to try and share.  Few of the items we had that I liked particularly: Potato croquette (2 pieces for 3$) Bulgogi kimbap (5$) Mozzarella sticks (5 pieces for 4$) Korean fried chicken (10 pieces for 11$) Kimchi fried rice (8$) Bulgogi pizza (14$)  They were having a special of buy 2 get 1 draft beer free , with choices being Blue Moon , Coors Light , Asahi , and something else I forgot. The boys got two rounds of Blue Moon and Coronas which went very well with our dinner. We also had soju - the yogurt soju was so so good !! Definitely want to try the peach , yuzu , and lychee flavors next time.  For dessert, we received the 1 free shaved ice for the table w/ Yelp check-in. They served us the same shaved ice like we got when we checked in at Karaoke Q :) It was enough for the 5 of us. I actually wasn't a fan of the shaved ice really , but I liked the vanilla ice cream on top. I wouldn't get it again unless it was free.  Would come back again for the Korean fried chicken and drinks !",

The waiter started us off with the traditional Korean side dishes, always my favorite part of the Korean dining experience. Not sure if the side dishes change from time to time like other restaurants, but this time, we got: - Tofu skin: SO GOOOOOD! I couldn't stop eating this - Weenies: pretty good.. they were hot dog weenies in a sauce mixture of ketchup and hot sauce - Noodles: Love it - Macaroni salad: not a huge fan of them usually but this was good  They were having a special of buy 2 get 1 draft beer free, with your choices being Blue Moon, Coors Light, Asahi, and something else. We all got two rounds of Asahi which went very well with our dinner.  We ordered 20 pieces of wings for 5 people. We chose the flavors \"supreme\" and \"soy garlic.\" If you want to know how \"supreme\" tastes, I found that our waiter described the supreme flavor very very accurately, \"it's sweet but sour, and on a spicy level of 1 to 10, it's like a 4.\"  The soy garlic flavor was very good! The supreme was great as well but was actually too spicy for me. I was only able to eat one or two (note: radishes are great palette cleansers!).  We ordered another dish to share but it ended up being too spicy for the entire table and I wasn't a fan of the strong kimchi taste so I only had 1-2 bites.  For dessert, we received the 1 free shaved for the table. The size of the shaved ice was enough for the 5 of us. I actually wasn't a fan of the shaved ice really. It had strawberries and bananas to top it off along with (vanilla?) ice cream. The flavor of the shaved ice was mango or melon or a combination of something too sweet for my taste. I wouldn't get it again unless it was free.  Overall, good experience, and would come back again for the beer and wings.",

Only down side of having busy business in small area.   After a crazy Friday night of drinking we needed some comfort food. Especially some spicy noodles or soup. QBistro hit the spot!!  We ordered Budae Jjigae, or army soup as it's also known,  we also ordered the cold spicy noodle dish and a pizza.   The stew was a very nice size, made for two people. (At least). Had great flavor, with not one tone over powering the other. So many ingredients in the stew from spam, mushrooms, bell peppers, tofu, beef, hotdog, jalapeno, kimchi and I'm sure I'm forgetting a handful more!  It wasn't crazy spicy but enough kick to give it some good flavor.  It's heated table side on a small burner, keeping the broth bubbling hot!   The spicy noodle dish was also a great new dish we haven't tried before. Thick chewy noodles tossed in spicy sauce with cabbage, boiled egg and a bunch of other stuff on top.  Very flavorful!  The spice kinda creeps up on you with this dish.   Pizza was ok. Didn't expect much since it's a Korean restaurant and it was for our 7 yr old.   Service was really nice. Servers were all very friendly and attentive.  Pricing was very reasonable and we will def be back to try our those chicken wings!!",

Until we have experienced such an alarming abrupt person yelling out to us as we are walking out of the restaurant and telling us we DIDN'T tip on our receipt. Well, first of all, if you checked our table, then you'll see the cash tip left under the water pitcher!  (unfortunately that would've been the first time they'll randomly come and see how things are...when no one is already there!) You expect and yelled to me I never left a tip? Who does that?! In front of the entire restaurant, where people are currently having their meal! Very unprofessional!   Everyone! They are in for your tips! Even with horrible service, they expect that tip to be at least 18%! Be careful, they might scream at you if you leave cash tip on the table with \"0\" on the signed receipt! It's ashamed because this was our \"go to\"  place with my children and whenever we have family in town, this is where we would take them. Never again I will bring my family and friends here. They just lost a whole lot of loyal customers.   I guess it's a great thing we ve experienced that type of service. It allows us to venture out and not just settle for where we always go to.   Thanks to a tall female server running to the front to get attention from another female named Jean (mananger) because she never saw the cash tip on the table. And to you Jean, who thought we never left any tip and hault at us about never leaving any tip on the check! Thank you for your unacceptable customer service.   Keep up the inappropriate and unsuitable customer service.   Totally an act of professionalism and a disgrace to patrons.",

There were 4 in our party and had to wait a little due to being a weekend and the place was busy when we arrived, which is understandable. Not too long after we got sat to our table we decided to order our food, which consisted of 2 orders of Rice Cake noodles, Supreme style chicken wings and Seafood soup. Food didn't take too long to come out. Our server never came back to check on our table after the food was delivered and we would have to wave someone down if needed anything else, YES they have the call button on the table, BUT if your working to earn tips, shouldn't you be more attentive to your customers!? That is how tipping works right!!?   My 1 star review is for a very poor customer service by our server and a VERY Extremely unprofessional customer service from the manager Jean. After dinner was done, we received our check and I proceeded to the front to pay for our dinner. Very surprising to see that this place suggests 18% gratuity minimum on customers receipt.... WOW!! Maybe the manager needs to re-visit that and add new suggestions especially for the low quality of service they provide. Let me remind you that we visit here often. Upon walking out of the restaurant, we were haulted by a lady who we weren't sure who she was and yelling to my wife in front of another customer saying YOU didn't leave gratuity on your check!!! Who the hell does that!!! My wife told Jean who later on we found out that she was the manager, that cash tip was left on the table. You earn your tips on how well you perform on servicing your customers, not by the amount on what your customers spent!!!! You've just lost some customers here.",

I've found it in the dessert of Nevada aka sin city, or Las Vegas.   Crispy skin, fall of the bone white/dark meat, and just incredible flavors of fried chicken with supreme sauce (tangy, spicy, sweet) that will leave you feeling like a million bucks!   Extra stars to our super awesome server. I dig their decor so much at this place it inspired me to get in touch with my child like abilities like creativity, open-mindedness, etc. I mean wow like I really love this place because that fried chicken can't be ignored. It's a must have at least once in your life!",

    "text": "Q Bistro does Korean Fried Chicken right! You can choose between plain, soy garlic, mild, and spicy - either way you will get that delicious crunchy crust and juicy meat inside. I ordered the single portion and it was a pretty big portion (trust me, I can eat!).  I also tried their LA Galbi (delicious marinade - lots of flavor - a little bit sweeter than at other K BBQ spots but I like it that way!).   The Dolsot Bibimbap was also very good (and again a generous portion).  There were about 5 types of banchan - the chapchae was perfect , there was a random hotdog in tomato sauce dish that I've not had before but it was tasty too (no fish cake though which is my fave).   They have a pretty diverse menu so I will need to come back to try the other items - pork hock, kimbap, soups, OH! and they have pizza too!   The restaurant is clean, service is attentive.  I didn't like the taste of the water. Very metallic. I can usually count on a great icy pitcher of water when I go to a Korean restaurant so, that was the only downside really. They have a pretty good selection of drinks though - soju, sodas, beers, juices.",

    "text": "TLDR; This place was perfect! Everything from the service to the food to the environment was amazing. Even if you don't like Korean/bistro type of food I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the area.   Service Servers are very friendly and attentive. They make sure you always have enough water, appetizers, or anything else you may need. The service was great regardless of how busy it was in the restaurant.  Environment The inside was very artistic and fun, exactly how I imagine a bistro to be. I think they even do karaoke there as well. They do play kpop music/videos so if you are into that its great.   Food Everything we order was very hot and fresh. The quality and attention to detail are second to none.   Banchan - This place serves free banchan regardless of what you order which is pretty great if you ask me. They have the standard tofu, kimchi, etc. and even did japchae which was my favorite  Kimbab - We got the kimbab with bulgogi. The ratios of rice, meat, and vegetables were perfect. It is a very big dish for the price.  Omelette Rice - This huge omelette is stuffed with a sausage fried rice. It was very flavorful and filling and hit my comfort food spot.   Macaroons - With a Yelp check-in you get a free sampler of macaroons and every flavor was really good. My favorite was the chocolate one.",

We ordered Corn Cheese ($7), Omelet Rice ($10), Spicy Pork ($15), Chicken Gizzards ($13), Fried Chicken Wings ($12), Spicy Tofu Soup ($10.50), and Squid Stone Pot Bibim-Bop ($12).   We assumed the portions would be typical of Korean bar food.  Meaning, we expected small portions.  However, the portions are huge!  We all left the restaurant leaving full, but still had enough leftovers for the three of us to eat for lunch and dinner the following day.  The Bibim-Bop was my favorite dish.  It was cooked in a stone pot.  So, the rice on the bottom was nice and crunchy.  The Chicken Wings are well fried to ensure the skin remains crisp even after it is covered with sauce.    The servers were all extremely friendly and responsive.  They checked on our table several times and offered to cancel any orders if we were feeling too full.    The decor is a lot of fun.  The restaurant is dark like a bar, but has lots of Christmas-like lighting.  The booth seating along the main wall features tables in a shell-like area, which feels like a mini private room.    The food does not compare to Los Angeles' Koreatown.  However, the atmosphere, service, and price make up for it!",

Pork hock plate was good as well, with Lettuce and other side dishes to wrap with the pork. Stir fried squirt with pork belly a bit salty and very very oily. Wouldn't recommend that. Love the spicy seafood soup. The broth was very tasty and refreshing.   Please note that all of dishes come in large portions.",

(Keep in mind we were hungry) For reference the wings are larger than buffalo wild wings. The wait was pretty long though. So by the time we got our food we didn't have time to take photos. Only con would be the long wait time, there were only 2 waitresses for everyone and they seemed to be very busy. Hopefully they can add another waitress so they can handle the busyness better. Definitely will be coming back!",

    "text": "My husband wanted me to try Bobchon, so we found this place on yelp and kept it in my bookmarks. So glad my hubby remembered me mentioning it was a late night spot being we were looking to get dinner around 10pm last night.   Parking was a nightmare, but understandable considering the food and entertainment options in the plaza.   Overwhelmed by the loud karaoke place next door, we were relived when we walked in  to the calm Bistro. We were kind of exhausted from the day and wanted a calm meal. The ambiance was unique. Loved the private feel that was given with the garland-like curtains. The tables were quite large so an intimate feel was missing but we fixed that by sitting side-by-side on the bench.   We started with drinks. We typically like to drink something imported to go with the ethnicity of the meal. Thanks to our server, she was extremely understanding when we didn't care for the pomegranate wine and brought us two Korean beers instead. BO was a perfect match for our meal!  The chicken wings ruined me. I will never be able to eat a chicken wing anywhere else. You can hear the crunch with every bite! You'd think that with a wing as crispy as these the meat would be dried out but that is NOT the case here at all. Each bite was filled with juicy goodness!  The wings were huge but honestly the crispy outer skin was what made them, along with the supreme sauce of course!  Next time I would do the popcorn chicken. I spied them on the table beside us and loved that you could mix and match two sauces and I can only imagine the crisp you'd get with every bite!  The slaw that accompanied the wings was nothing to brag about. I was hoping it would have share a similar flavor of the macaroni salad they give as a side before the meal.   Now, once the spice from the Supreme sauce was all I could taste, the pickled daikon was a great way to cleanse the palate before delving into our pizza.  How unique, pizza at a Korean bistro!  I'm glad that we were able to do two toppings.  We went specifically for the kalbi pizza but to our surprise the sweet potato pizza blew us away!    Overall the food was great!  Service was slow, we sat for a while waiting to get out of there.  I guess that was a good thing because it gave our full bellies some time to rest!",

Also came with the traditional side dishes - I wasn't expecting that as I thought that was just for Korean BBQ. They were excellent.  2 picked vegetables and a sweet potato salad (or regular potato salad with some sweet sauce).   I will definitely try the other main courses.  Saw a hamburger steak and a katsu dish that looked good.   Friendly employees and nice decor.",

Which by the way gave intensifying American-Korean infused favors! 4 stars for that! Plus a free shaved ice dessert for checking in; so don't forget.

They will often bring out some fresh fruit or ice cream at the end of dinner at no charge.    Paradoxically, the atmosphere is intimate, but kind of on the loud side with the music. I don't mind too much, but be prepared to yell a little bit. That said, what really makes this place shine is the service. I usually roll in there with a crew of about 12 people every Wednesday night and the staff is SUPER patient and helpful. Also, they get the orders out quickly and never gripe about having to split the checks among so many people. (Which is why I tend to tip them about 30-40%)  Anyway, give them a try. You won't be sorry. :)",

I would say everything was delicious especially the tofu soup, however the kimchi fried rice was a little disappointing. Didn't have very much flavor and the kimchi wasn't all that great like I've had in the past at other Korean restaurants. They also ran out of bulgogi so we didn't really get to try that either. Other than that, the food was good and the service was decent.",

We came here on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately due to there not being more than 3 other tables seated. It's very dark in here and they have cool decor. They also have TV's with sports playing for the football fans. Just, no sound.   The main guy working the hostess desk was playing really slow love songs. That was kind of weird, but whatever. It was some really good 90's hits - Boyz II Men. Oh yes.  He was also our waiter. I don't know if he serves much because he seemed a little out of place. He was very blunt, which I appreciate, but he seemed as if it really wasn't his job to serve. Also, he didn't check up on us often. We had to get his attention a couple of times. He was very nice though.   The food was excellent. I recommend -   The fried pot stickers, Spicy BBQ Pork Ribs and Bulgogi. I definitely want to go back and try out more. All of the meat was cooked perfectly with amazing flavors and the ribs fell off the bone. Best thing is the prices are extremely reasonable. The only thing I wish they had was Kalbi.",

The soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually, I wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy. Bimbap was excellent. Delicious and very comforting. Of course all the sides great as usual with Korean Cuisine. Overall, we were pretty happy. Service was good, even though I've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention. I am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy. Would come back and have a few other things on the menu.",

The place did not disappoint at all. For one they serve bottle beer only ($3-$4) and they do have a few Korean beers that are must try. For my meal I had their wings in supreme and soy garlic sauce (all wings were excellent and great, supreme was the better of the two). I also had some bulgogi fried rice which was also really good (when you order the fried rice, it comes out with like 7 different sides from kimchi to spiced Vienna sausages to onions and many more). Only thing I didn't really like was that their bathroom isn't open to the public. However when I come back to Vegas, I will be back here for some more wings.",

For Appetizer, I ordered the baked mussels  which wasn't what I expected. Looked very good but wasn't as tastey and cheesy enough. I also ordered the cheese corn which i definitely enjoyed. I liked how it had stretchy cheese... so yummy! The Fried chicken was just ok... better tasting with the sauce. Portions were big and worth it for the price. I loved the Bulgogi and the side dishes. The beef was nice and tender. i loved the flavor and it was so good with the rice. The waitress was very nice and attentive. I liked how she gave us extra rice without us needing to ask for it and even gave us free extra rice when we asked for boxes to go. For dessert, we had the shaved ice with fruit. It's free when you check in on Yelp. It looked so good and the taste was pretty good too. Will definitely be back to try more!",

The Supreme was a little more on the spicy side, however; our side of white rice balanced out the spice. Soy Garlic had a nice salty flavor as well.

    "text": "I am so glad that we chanced upon this little place, an off-shoot of Q Karaoke lounge next door.  We had actually intended to go to a Szechuan restaurant on Spring Mountain, but upon arriving decided it was a little too Szechuan...  Checking on Yelp for a high-rated Asian, we decided to head over to this place just around the corner.  It's always great to chance upon a great tasting place, but when it is a great Korean place in Vegas, it makes the night.  This place is small, nice but simply decorated, with two large screen TVs.  It's an L-shaped place but the TVs are right next to each other, so there is no view from the other side of the L.  Wish they change that.  We are greeted by an adorable hostess, who ends up being our server as well.  Super cute and super sweet girl...   We order fried calamari, beef brisket, and sweet potato fries, along with a bottle of makgeolli.  The calamari was good, some pieces were a bit dry but generally meaty and served with cocktail sauce and a soy sauce/sesame oil mix.  The sweet potato fries were great, sufficiently crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The real winner was the brisket though, served with awesomely yummy side dishes and Korean-style leek salad.  Brisket comes cooked on a bed of onions and jalapenos.  Dip the meat in sesame oil and eat it with the leek salad, and it's marvelous.  I also have to mention the side dishes - fish cakes, sausage, kimchi, japchae, and mung beans - all of which were all fantastic.    We came here early, around 7pm or so, and it was basically empty.  I'm guessing, since this is a Korean bar, that it comes alive later in the night?  It surely deserves to be crowded, so I'm wondering if we were just early.  Anyways, with great food, cozy but good atmosphere, and great service, we will definitely make our way back here, perhaps after 9pm.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Probably not a good idea, it's a bar with no bar, and not conducive to accommodating single patrons.",

The chicken is extremely crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside it makes the white meat tastes like dark meat!  I love all the sauces they offer but the soy garlic is my favorite.  The family size is a huge portion and can easily feed 4-6 depending on ones appetite.  The dishes come with some ban chan (side dishes) and the cabbage salad with thousand island is a nice pairing to the spicy flavors in some of the dishes and chicken flavors.  We tried the bulgogi fried rice and that was tasty as well.  We also ordered the stir fried gizzards and I would have to recommend not getting it....not enough flavor and overly chewy.  But I'll overlook anything for good fried chicken or in this case SUPERB fried chicken.  Just two words bomb diggity! Similar concept to Soyo but with a cheaper price point.  The chicken beats the chicken wings at soyo and beats the fried chicken at Bazic.  Definitely give this place a try if you are a fried chicken connoisseur and perhaps you can head next door for a little karaoke action afterwards.",

It was so crispy on the outside and the meat was cooked to perfection inside.   the service was slow at beginning, but it was only because we didn't realize we're supposed to ring the bell. Haha! Once we figured that out, everything went very smoothly. Oh, if you check in on yelp, you get 4 delicious macarons!! Great experience. It satisfied my craving for Korean food. Will be back!!",

    "text": "Came her late on a Sunday evening with friends after a night of shenanigans. It wasn't busy, with one person manning the front, server, and clean up. He was probably the nicest, and quickest server who I met and was working alone. The restaurant is next  to the Q Karaoke, so be sure not to enter there!   We ordered several dishes, but by far my favorites were the fried chicken and the kimbamp which should totally be dipped into the fish cake sauce. Don't understand how it pairs, but it does!! Smother that shit with it. Seriously.  Kimchi fried rice and corn cheese weren't as great as expected, but what made it up were the incredible sides. Get more fish cakes and bean sprouts. They were to die for. Sides are refillable, don't forget.   All in all, I'd definitely come back. The fried chicken was still crunch the next day. Don't forget your supreme sauce on the side, you'll be sorry you missed out.",

    "text": "Found this little gem by chance when visiting with my family this past weekend.  I stalked their Instragram account which was filled with pictures of gooey ramen pots, bulgogi pizza, and wings. My stomach jumped with anticipation.  The drive to Chinatown away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip was a relief.  There wasn't a lot of parking (it's located in a shopping center with lots of restaurants, karaoke bars, and Asian shops), but we found one after a few minutes.  We went around 6:30pm and it wasn't packed (score for a family) and it was CUTE. Dimly-lit with lights but fun and trendy, chalkboard walls highlighting soju specials and menu items.  Here's what we ordered: Mozzarella sticks (simple and good) Mini corn dogs (like Weinerschnitzel ones, also good) Bulgogi pizza (YES!) Kimbab (like a Korean sushi) LA Kalbi (words can't even describe how good this is. I wish I had 2 orders) Budaejjigae (HUGE and can be shared with multiple people)  I have to say I would come back here, and I'll probably end up ordering 2 orders of Kalbi, it was that good.",

    "text": "My group went here late last night around 2:30 AM on 11 February 2018. We chose to come here because it was open until 3:30 AM on a Saturday and the ratings were good.  When we went there we were the only customers. I had to find the staff to let them know that we were here. A female Korean wait staff (I did not see a name tag) came out at told us that they were closing and that last call is in 10 minutes. I replied that the signs outside said that it was open until 3:30 AM. Since it was not last call, we said that we can order quickly.  We asked for menus and water to start off. The waitress slammed the water and cups rudely on the table. She indicated that she wanted us out. She succeeded in kicking us out but she was rude and her tone was definitely angry. After a few minutes, our group was not feeling the group and service of this type, warranted no tip for sure. We left but I told the waitress that she got what she wanted and that because it was so obvious that she did not want to work, her attitude got her what she wished for.  We got no apology for closing earlier than posted and the ambivalence caused me trouble as I was finding a place for my out of town guest to eat. I hope that the owner or manager reprimands the waitress that was working at that time last night. I did see two staff (one male and one female) and only had interaction with the female one.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place out because the reviews all seem positive and good with the pictures of the food looking delicious. Turned out to be a disaster for me and my friend. I now understand why everyone gives this place 4-5 stars, because the restaurant bribes you to write a review on Yelp to get a free drink or food item. I think more people should be honest and write their reviews without being pressure to make a good review just because they give you something free here.   My friend and I wanted to try the pork hock plate so we ordered it. My friend wanted pork soup but they didn't have anything so our server recommend we get the kimchi soup which says it has pork in it. We asked if the soup was spicy and the server told us just a little spicy. When we got the soup, it was really spicy. My friend didn't eat much of the soup she was disappointed because she can't really eat spicy and our server said it was just a little bit but he lied and of course he didn't try to fix it or make t better he just told her to drink some water. What the hell is that? The soup also had almost no pork in it. They were very very very small piece and I only found 3 piece on the bottom and you have to like dig into the soup to find any pork and when you did it was super super small. Soup was very disappointing. We had a pasta side dish and my friend eventually finish it and she wanted more since the side dishes come in very small portion. She asked the server to refill on the side dish and she had to ask him 4 times before he went to refill it! On top of that our server never came to check up on us and our meal. My friend had to yell a few times to get his attention to come to us.   I was super super disappointed in the pork hock plate as well. The meat was very cold, no flavor, and very hard to eat. I was so so disappointed. We asked to cancel this dish and asked to take it back and we would order a substitute but our server wouldn't let us and you have to remember we are at a Korean restaurant and their service won't be good as if you were at an American restaurant they would let you take back any dish if you were unsatisfied with your dish. We seriously just took one bite of the pork and everything was untouched for the dish. I don't understand why they wouldn't let you take back a dish if you were completely unhappy with the dish. They're ok with their customers being unhappy with the food? Yet they expect you to write a great review on Yelp because they're willing to give you a free item off their choice.   Overall I recommend everyone don't come here to eat the food isn't good and our server didn't care about us at all. Go eat at Soyo, Magal BBQ, Hobak or somewhere else their food and service is way way way better.",

I usually order the soy garlic and sweet and spicy. Both flavors are on point, mild, and not overwhelming at all. The side dishes here are great and we always keep them coming!

I get so excited talking about this place.  Location: It's located in a plaza with icy juicy, modas cafe, and cue-d's. Parking can be a bit of a hassle depending on the time of day you get there, but you shouldn't have a problem finding one.   Vibe & layout: The place has changed a lot from it's early days. There's a decent amount of tables, I never had to wait for one. Everything is pretty modern, they have buttons on tables that you ring if you need a waiter.   Customer service & Food: I haven't had one bad customer service so far, the waiters are attentive and if you ever did anything just ring the bell. Prices are very fair too. I always order the family style half and half soy garlic, and sweet and mild. You can definitely share it with 2-3 people so it ends up being really cheap per person. Beware of the SUPREME SAUCE it's a bit spicy. Get the cabbage salad with thousand island too! Their sauce is dank 11/10.   Protip: They change their check in offers every once in a while, but still take advantage of it! So far I've seen free dessert, free soda, free shot, and now I think it's free shaved ice.",

We ordered our food to-go: mainly an order of regular and spicy fried chicken (scorcher!) and then the sweet potato pizza and bacon-potato pizza. When we got home and our small party started to dig in, we were all very delighted that the food tasted fantastic! The chicken was crispy outside and tender on the inside with the perfect amount of seasoning. The pizzas were topped to the brim and made exactly as we had hoped! We always miss our fave Korean chicken and pizza joints in OC (and the ones we knew locally in Vegas closed), so this place was a welcome surprise. We'll definitely be back to try the bulgogi pizza and the other Korean dishes. Beer and karaoke also seems like an awesome pairing!",

    "text": "So I'm not a HUGE Korean food fan, but my wife wanted something spicy. She is Japanese and we mostly eat Japanese food, however as most of you know, Japanese don't typically make spicy food. Even if they do, they don't make it like Koreans... Soooo, let's do it - Q bistro.  It's in a typical China town kinda parking lot. That means it's wall to wall restaurants and you circle 3 times to find an open space. At first we were like uhhhhh, as we aren't from here and thought we were lost. We wanted dinner. We see a Q karaoke... A Q pool hall, a freaking Q hair salon... So I'm like  A: ummm we need to find a different place to eat. We've been mislead. B: whoever Q is, is a baller. Dude owns a lot.  WAIT!!! There it is... Tucked away between Q karaoke and the salon. Ok cool, let's go in.  Whooooooooo, this place looks trendy and so clean. Fancy looking too I'm like oh man we are under dressed... Until we see the staff. They weren't dressed inappropriately, just saying same as us. Jeans and t shirt kinda thing... But this place LOOKS so nice that you could wear nicer clothes, a shirt and tie, dress and heals, would not look out of place. The environment is pretty cool. I really enjoyed that. It's like you're in a high end spot, paying low end prices. True definition of ballin on a budget. Guys wanna make that girl you're dating THINK you are stacked when you ain't? Take her here. She'll find out eventually, but not before dinner lol.  Menu was huge for a bistro. Like 8 pages from apps to zerts... Mix of everything. Mostly Korean, but they still had cheese sticks, pizza, etc... But again, mostly Korean.  With 15% tip we still came in UNDER $40. Which is pretty reasonable.  We had:  Croquette Cheese sticks Spicy short rib Rice Spicy ramen Inarizushi  Coke Water 5 lil dishes that always come with everything you order in Korea lol. Never know what they are but the normal lil kimchi stuff.  The inarizushi is freaking huge, it's damn near a meal in itself. The spicy ribs were delicious, tender, and had few pieces of doppoki with it. Nice touch. Cheese sticks were exactly as if you're at like Applebee's not amazing but it's Korean place, I WOULD be the retard or I expected jaw dropping cheese sticks here lol. The croquette had cheese in it... BONUS! We had no idea how BIG the servings were.. We ordered and received all that food, could barely finish half of it, left 15%, still under $40.  So had we known how much (or rather how large) the portions were... We'd probably only spent about $25.... Well, not really. We'd still spent $40 but would've had dessert lol.  Big time drink menu too. I don't drink though, but if I did they had it all.  The food was good, seriously... But the biggest take away I have is how nice and upscale these place seems with how low it's cost is... It's kinda cool. The girl that was our server was from Vietnam... But we don't care. We from Okinawa... So it's whatever. I'm only saying so because in my reviews of Japanese places I always mention of they people are actually Japanese... There were Koreans in there, but again, we don't know the difference in real Korean food (although because of work I've lived in Gwangju and Daegu Korea for 2 yrs)... So it didn't matter to us that she wasn't Korean. Besides, I ordered cheese sticks lol... So really I guess I should've been looking for an Italian chef huh?! FuuuhhGetAboutIt ",

They have signs on each table that say that if you give them a review you will get a free dessert/side dish like fries - I am not a fan of such promotion because it skews the reviews on here and does not accurately represent the restaurant. With that being said, the food was overall not that great. The wings were ginormous and sauced well, but nothing exciting (tried supreme and soy garlic). The sea snail salad was a little salty and the spicy rice cake was way too salty. Service was bad and un-attentive, there was only one at the time. The idea of asian fusion and comfort food was good but the execution sucked and the food was meh. Won't be going back for the food unfortunately.",

We then had 3 sojus, but the cool part was when you order 2 you get 1 free so at $7/soju; not a bad deal.  I enjoyed my late night Korean find in Chinatown.  The restaurant was pretty empty which I thought was a bad sign, but the night lived up to the hype.  Definitely worth a go if looking for some late night eats and drinks.  And if karaoke is your jam then go next door and rent a room and enjoy the same food and drinks while singing your heart out.",

So I just kept walking along and finally found it. Was seated right away. The place is dark as heeeck lol..  My boyfriend ordered a fried rice with (I think it was) steak. And was told that there's no steak, so he chose chicken or some shi instead. I ordered a bibimbap that was actually pretty good!!   When my boyfriend's food came out, the waitress said that \"We don't have the (chicken) either so we made you this.\" I think it was bulgogi? UMMMMM?? You should have ASKED first, because what if he doesn't like that? The F. It was okay, but whatever right. They JUST made him that, without asking him.  ALSO. The water cups smelled like straight up bleach.. It's different to have sanitizing water to rinse everything off with, but that bleach level was probably waay too high.  Whatever I guess, we came at a wrong time.",

We ordered a few flavored sojus, spicy beef soup with noodles, pork belly, kimbap, and wings. Almost everything were good especially the spicy beef soup! It was so spicy and flavorful. The kimbap was only okay. The pork belly was good and the wings too were saucy for me. I should of got them plain!   The service on the other hand was very forgetful when it wasn't very busy. They forgot our soju and calamari.   I also have another complaint that our flavored sojus did not even have barely a splash of alcohol. We didn't even feel drunk after 3 large flavored sojus or even tasted alcohol in them. For $15, you're better off getting the actual soju bottle for cheaper and stronger alcohol.   Lastly, I didn't come to Q Bistro to have a girl butt cheeks hanging out of their skirts while I was eating. If I wanted that then I would of went to Cafe Tease...",

I would think I would be the one who knew what I had ordered for myself but according to my server I was wrong. She also continued to say that once the food has been made she cannot take it back. Is this real life right now? Ridiculous.  Quality of food was meh. Eghhhhhh, maybe three stars. The reason why we decided to dine there was because of the good reviews of their KFC which come to find was not True for us. The wings were better than the whole chicken but still mediocre, definitely not as good as the KFC at Bonchon. The whole chicken included parts of the chicken that you didn't know existed or we were just lucky enough to get the chicken they picked from a farm down the way from a nuclear power plant.   Really wanted to like this place but if I wanted mediocre food and be repeatedly told that I'm in the wrong then I would save some money and just go to my grandma's.",

Coming from SD, we have a decent selection of Korean restaurants but not much as far as late night snacks.  We got the tteokbokki or spicy rice cakes. I don't remember if I knew it had cheese or not but I do remember being overly happy when I saw it came with cheese.   For someone with a bad spice tolerance, I endured the pain and kept eating the rice cakes. I'm missing them right now, as I right this review.  My girlfriend and I were planning to get the bulgogi pizza on the drive back but they're not open. When my friends and I came to Vegas, I hyped it up but ended up realizing it was closed .

    "text": "Q Bistro is a really great place to eat at when you're in the mood for something comforting, like pizza or wings, and having an Asian flair to it. It's also a cool place to hang out with friends because of the really late business hours and the karaoke joint (Q Karaoke) that's right next door. Similar names, one establishment.  I highly recommend their Bulgogi Pizza and Soy Garlic Chicken Wings. These are my family's faves! Especially the Soy Garlic Chicken. It's bomb. Definitely a must-try.  When ordering the wings, you can choose how many pieces you'd like. A great option when you have a bigger group at your table. And because I'm a french fry-head, I advise you to add a side of fries to your order. lol  Service is awesome and I've never had any complaints. The call button that's built-in on each table is also a really good way to make sure customer service is readily available.  As for Q's karaoke joint, it's the one I mostly go to, and have been for years. They have more rooms than other karaoke places such as A18, but they can get really busy on the weekends. There is a waiting list if all the rooms are full and you'll never know when you'll be called. However, their music selection is always being updated and new songs are added all the time. Having songs in different languages is a plus!",

First, they've upgraded their interior so it looks much more pleasing to the eyes. This place is so spacious and you don't ever feel like you're too close to the other patrons. Keeping your dinner conversations private is not something you have to worry about at all.  My friends and I always get the chicken here with the supreme sauce and it always hits the spot! The pieces aren't small at all unlike some other places to get wings at. We always get the wings with fries because they're just the perfect combo. I love their seafood pancake too and I highly recommend others to try it. If you're feeling like you want a drink too, then definitely get their soju; it's awesome that they usually have buy two, get one free with it.  Service here is usually always on point. I've never felt rushed with placing my orders and staff is usually very attentive. Try this place and you won't regret it!",

After losing my local fav Korean fried chicken places outside of Ktown back in Cali, I've been trying to replace them with no avow. Order the fried chicken of course! I had the Supreme which is a whole chicken fried and smothered in the most addictive batter and sauce to ever meet a fried chicken. EVER. There is another dish that pretty much kills all other versions I've had of it. Both would be amazing with a beer but are so fricken delicious you can totally have them alongside water. Since I'm moving to Vegas I'm super glad this will be a local spot for me. Dang tho I wasn't ready for it! And the KPop only adds to an awesome Korean restaurant atmosphere. Banchan's fresh and delicious. Parking in this plaza is murder but worth it. And then the bingsoo just happened. Like the United Nations of fruit in a bowl ya'll. This place has me philosophizing. Like what is gravity? What is life? Maybe the 'Q' in Q Bistro stands for question. Thanks Q Bistro. I can die now.",

Q Bistro is located in a pretty busy and popping strip mall not too far from the Strip/Mirage. Plenty of parking to be found despite how busy/popping the strip mall was!  My friend and I both shared the combination sundubu, yukaejang, and soy garlic chicken wings. All the dishes were reasonably priced (each item was under $12 each)  and delicious. The chicken wings were perfect-- perfectly crispy with enough sauce to provide flavor without making the chicken skin soggy. Meals come with the standard banchan- including kimchi, macaroni salad (yum!), fishcake, daikon, and green veggies marinated in sesame oil. Also came with a side of salad with a very delicious sweet sesame salad dressing. My friend and I were both extremely full from all the ordered food, and we still had leftover extra wings to eat as late night snack.   Definitely will be back here for late night Korean eats. I'm happy my friend recommended this place because it's affordable, tasty, and well portioned! Noms.",

They have appetizers, small plates, and a lot of shareable food items. They have a lot of traditional Korean food like kimbap and bibimpap, but some creative stuff like a bulgogi pizza and their awesome Korean fried chicken wings.  They have a lot of fun drinks like yogurt soju and they have buttons on their table when you need the staff.  I tried their onion rings, calamari, kimbap, their bulgogi pizza, potato pizza, and their fried chicken.  Everything was really good and I would definitely order the items again. The pizzas were about $15 each.  If you get fried chicken I'd say all their flavors are delicious but the buffalo wasn't my favorite. The wings were 20 for about $20.  The bulgogi kimbap was my favorite item and they were only $6.  I would definitely go back for a Korean spin on pizza and wings!",

I felt the tofu soup was really fresh and tasted different than other Korean restaurants. The only negative for me was it was so hot in the restaurant, the loud music, and the service once it got busy. In the beginning they were very attentive but once the restaurant filled up our waitress was nowhere to be found. We waited 35 min for the check, paying, boxes to go part of the dinner. The heat was so bad I had to can myself through dinner. Blasting Frozen -Let it Go and Mariah Carey Christmas music in March was a bit much. Turn down the music at 6pm - way too loud.   The food itself was good but when eating dinner you want to feel comfortable not sweat pouring down the back of my head and I had to almost scream with our friends to hear them.",

Initially, we came here for Karaoke, but after reading all the reviews raving about the food, we thought we'd kill 2 birds with one stone and get some dinner as well. Also, my husband was craving some Korean fried chicken anyway so why not.  So, can't really complain about the karaoke aspect here. Decent selection of songs. The book is massive, but like 75% of the songs are Korean, so if you are into Kpop or here to sing in Korean, you have found the perfect place. It also has a decent selection of English and Japanese songs.   The food is where I become torn. It was mediocre at best. We ordered original KFC and bulgogi fries. The chicken was, like, ROCK SOLID. I know KFC is typically super crunchy, but crunchy and hard are not the same. Subsequently, the chicken was hella dry. My husband liked it, but I was not here for it. Skip. The bulgogi fries as well were, like, ALMOST good. It was essentially nachos on fries though, I didn't feel anything \"Korean\" about it. Just some onions, tomatos, mayo, and ground beef on french fries. Okay? I mean, it wasn't bad I guess. I wouldn't order it again though.   That being said, we had a fantastic time here. We spent around 2 hours here + the food and it came out to $65. I'd say thats a pretty good deal. I WOULD recommend coming here for Karaoke and drinks, and even some food as a group. I would NOT recommend coming here solely for food.",

Music and food while you relax with friends is a good way to spend a night out if you're not looking for the night life. Chicken wings, rice and salads, and other good choices to pick from. Waitresses are very helpful when it comes to picking out items and suggesting what they consider the best times on the menu. Everything is made from scratch so you know it's gunna be good. Tables are dim so it's a relaxed feeling in there. Overall a place I'd recommend to try.",

    "text": "Cashier/Hostess not too familiar with their menu offering. Not a good first impression nearly from the get go. Like you have an entire menu section dedicated to just chicken wings with different sauces, how can you not know?  Anyway, lack of menu knowledge aside, their chicken wings are pretty bomb. I went with original and supreme. The original basically is just fried chicken wings in their house seasoning, served without any sauce.  The Supreme is fried chicken wings in their spicy Supreme sauce (has some kick that builds up over time, not one that will bring you to your knees right off the bat. Not unless you are French.)  I ordered these to go and they included some diced marinated radish and a side of coleslaw (Family size order).  This snack was good and my friends and I killed it in no time.  I would come back in the future to check out the rest of the menu, especially their pizzas, or after spending time next door at their Karaoke lounge.  I think with the traditional side dishes that are typically served with your food, it would be a better value.  While waiting for my order, I had ample time to check out the decor. The atmosphere is trendy, with street art-style decor on black walls, as if you were at some underground club in LA.  Tables were not placed too close together, which is nice.  The place was maybe 20% full at about 7:30pm on a weekday, when the parking lot outside is packed and finding an open spot to park was a minor test in patience.  3 stars for now.  Will update again after I come back.",

My non Korean friends like to come here because they have fusion and non Korean eats also. Prices are average for vegas eateries and expect to pay about 15 a person for a meal and a drink and go for the 2 for 1 drink specials with a friend. Today is the mozzarella cheese sticks, egg omelet and soon tofu soup with a makgeoli rice wine to start and 5 different banchan-spinach, kimchi, bean sprouts, pasta salad, and fish cake. I give them a 6/10 for taste but wish there were a couple more. Medium spicy mixed seafood tofu soup is good, 8/10 because theres crab in it!! Standard mozz cheese sticks like any bar-7/10. Egg omelet is good but the girl doesn't eat meat and forgot to ask if there is meat in it. It does...sausage, I think, oops-6.5/10.",
