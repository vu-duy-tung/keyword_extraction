    "text": "Three of us had a brunch today. Two of us ordered the Brio Hamburgers and one of our group ordered the Sicilian Omelet. The omelet was very tasty, but two of us got sick eating hamburgers. Presentation- 8 out 10 Hamburgers were so dried and burned. A lady (she looks likes the manager of the Brio) asked us, if we ordered medium well. The server never asked us how our burgers like to cook. Arugula were wilted, French fries were too salty and hamburgers had no seasoning. Sadly we wouldn't order the hamburgers any more. Beautiful place and rotten hamburgers",

First..and foremost..the waiter. Careless..and almost like he didn't give a rats ass we were there cause he deserved a tip anyways.  My wife asked for the a pasta dish and NO mushrooms...of course it came out with mushrooms. Mother in law ordered the steak with veggies and mashed potaotes. Whoever was on the line was horrible. Veggies and mashed potatoes were ice cold and never should have left the kitchen. Another order of the fish was a letdown with over cooked and dried out fish.  Come on..the line failed, the person on the gill failed, and the server was a joke. Another example of over trendy and overhyped Summerlin crap.",

    "text": "I took my mother out for a nice dinner anticipating a pleasant experience, instead it became the opposite.  We waited 10 minutes too long before our waitress Hollie came to serve us.  She never introduced herself and the only reason I know her name it is because it is stated on the ticket.  I asked her specifically if the spaghetti bolognese was an entree that we could order and if it was made the same as before she said yes it is.  We had put in 2 orders and it came out with a different kind of pasta.  The gentleman that brought it out to us explained to us that it is made differently now which Hollie never told us after I had asked her specifically if it was.  The waiter was kind enough to change the order for us and we got what we originally wanted.  Hollie never stopped by the table to apologize for the mistake, as a matter of fact she completely disappeared for the entire dinner until we were finished.  Only then she asked if our meal was ok.  She never checked on us and didn't offer any bread, which we had to ask for, or was around for us to get more water or drinks.  The worse part is that she wasn't friendly at all and if anything made it very unpleasant for us dine there and made us feel discriminated.  Employees like her shouldn't be in the hospitality industry and she is costing you money by not providing a great experience for your customers.  If we had a better service we would have gotten more drinks and stayed for dessert.  It is very unfortunate that she represents your company and that we could have gotten better service somewhere else.  The food is good as always but we won't be coming back to the Summerlin location.",

The down fall for my husband and I is that the bill can add up quite quickly, by the time we have added drinks, salads and a few of those little mini desserts. It's worth it though, the peach sangria (get the pitcher) is yummo, and those mini desserts are even better!  My husband can be a picky eater too, and he is always able to find something on the menu that he can eat. The kids menu is pretty good too, the kids hamburger is huge and they love the fries!",

I recently herniated three discs so sitting in a wood chair sucks for me. So of course they tried to sit us in wooden chairs. She had a mini fit when I reminded her I asked for a booth. Trust me it sucks to be young and have had an accident I don't need a 19 year old treating me like I'm being difficult. To top it off it took twenty minutes for a waitress to come by. She seemed shocked no one had been by to take our drink order. By this time we had our menus sat to the side and were ready to order our meal.  There's to many good restaurants in this town to deal with bad service.",

Not this location unfortunately.   Waiter took 20 min to acknowledge us. Was nowhere to be found during the meal and filled our glasses once. I had to get up and look for the guy in the front of the kitchen to get him to come back to our table. And to top it off my $20 plate of Chicken Limone was nothing more than chicken on pasta. Missing the lemon completely on taste and only present in presentation.   I should have ordered what I normally order but I was feeling adventurous. I live in this neighborhood and am here daily so I expect to come back and have better service. You need to if you are going to stay afloat in Tivoli.  I'll revisit and update, hopefully with better news.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I like the Brio. It's really a nice venue and they have great outdoor patio seating. Also, their entrees are a cut above for an upscale fast casual restaurant, and their prices are reasonable. The entrees on my previous visits have been consistently good. Not so much on my latest visit. I ordered the Ham & Biscuit Benedict, $10.50 off the Brunch Menu. It consists of two poached cage free eggs, Cherrywood smoked ham, housemade biscuit and hollandaise, served with brunch potatoes. First, I was disappointed in the fact that my breakfast was not hot and was served cold. Bottom line, hot food should be served hot. The Cherrywood smoked ham had no flavor due to it being over cooked, as a result it was tough and chewy. Likewise, the house made biscuit was hard as a rock. On my previous visit their brunch potatoes were a big hit with everyone. This time they were over seasoned and very salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise was good. Two other people in our party had the same entree and made same or similar comments. Service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive. In closing, I recommend the Brio. However, I do not recommend this entree.",

It is worth mentioning, however, that happy hour usually PACKS the bar area... and in our case had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. If you are planning to come here for HH, show up right at the start so you can get a table right away.  We enjoyed some white peach sangria, mango mojitos, and appetizers, all of which were great. The spicy shrimp and Brio burger are by far the best dishes, but anything on the menu will be great for sharing at the table.

The eggplant pomodoro was ok...could hardly tell the cooked-to-death mush inside was once eggplant, but it was edible. The pasta it came with was very good, perfectly cooked with a very nice balance of garlic, seasoning, and oil. Next time, I'll have a simple pasta dish; they seem to know their pasta. The desserts were very good. I had the mocha pannacotta, and my friends had tiramisu and choc lava cake...all very, very good.   I can't give it more than a solid 3-star rating (this review ain't bad overall...it's just that mushy low-flavor eggplant that's sticking in my craw...maybe when I go back I'll be able to push it to 4 stars if I'm a big fan of whatever I order then).

    "text": "Spent last Saturday cruising the Tivoli Village Farmer's Market and once we'd loaded up on Kettle corn and asparagus, we decided to grab a bite to eat.  Having dined at the Brio in Town Square, and enjoyed it several times, we decided to give this location a go.  The patio was lovely at 11am on a Saturday. We managed to get there before the rush, so we had our pick of seats and it was quiet and very relaxing.   Our server wasn't the best in the world. He was a tall slim guy (though all the servers seemed to be super tall and slim) with a huge band-aid on the side of his neck. I assume this was to cover some kind of tattoo, but it wasn't that appetizing, i'll be honest.  However, because he was so soft spoken and meek, I thought maybe he had some kind of life-saving throat or neck surgery and cut him some slack.  His service was super slow and he forgot about us a few times, but I refused to let it ruin the brunch and let Mr. Potential Cancerous Goiter and/or Criss Angel Tattoo off without griping.  The peach bellini is TO DIE for. So good and comes in a giant pint glass. I thought it was going to be a simple bellini in a champagne flute, but no, this was like a booze slurpee. For $7. I'll have two next time.  I had the eggs benedict, which was absolutely delicious. The grilled asparagus that came with it was gone in 30 seconds. I like my poached eggs on the medium-well side and mine came so runny they were almost cold inside (which I realize is how some folks like them). But the manager, who happened to be walking by, had them remake them, despite my protests. She was really attentive and personable. I should've gotten her name -- she's got long dark hair and blue eyes, kinda on the wee side.  I'd definitely go back to this location, especially  for brunch. There's some berry stuffed french toast I've got my eye on...",

So why 3 stars?  I felt the portions were really small compared to what I can get at a mom and pop Italian joint...perhaps two ravioli entrees for one person would have been sufficient. Also, although the flavor was excellent, I found the sauce accompanying the lobster and shrimp dish a little watery, but the shrimp on top of the raviolis were cooked perfectly. My date liked her Ravioli alla vodka but felt it was small for a dinner portion.  Also the warm bread wasn't bad but wasn't anything amazing and the butter wasn't soft...and the atmosphere is a little dark, but I guess that's what they're going for.  On a bright note, the food came out fast, the waiter was attentive and I went during \"Ravioli Week\" so the 50% off was a great deal...had I walked out hungry paying the normal price of $55 (tax+tip) for two small ravioli dishes I'd have felt ripped.  Did I mention I like their big forks?",

Waited 20 mins to place order for apps and wine(single glass of wine came out after food, only because I reminded it hadn't come) at happy hour when it wasn't even busy outside. Over an hour and a half total at the table, never once got asked if we wanted to order dinner and/or dessert. Took 30 mins to get bill after we had noticeably been done eating, well, done eating all that we were able to order. Never a single water or soda refill either. By the time we finally got checked on, I asked for check as it was getting busy and no way I was going to wait even longer to maybe get dinner. Love the happy hour menu, but not sure I'll be back.",

Had to ask for everything from utensils, napkins, water numerous times, and they forgot part of our order and still charged us for it. This all occurred in the bar area on a weekend so we decided to give it a try in the dining room on a weekday. Totally different experience... the food was very good and the service was excellent. Glad we gave Brio's another shot.... we will just avoid the bar area and go to their dining area during the week!!!",

We initially had a concern due to a holiday special two for one for brunch and was told by the waitress that it only covered the specific brunch items not the brunch menu. The manager came over to clarify that it did indeed cover any items on the brunch menu up to $15. I ordered the Pesto Chicken and Quinoa Salad and loved it. The menu states all ingredients and the calories which is helpful in making decisions. It was so filling that I had to take some home. The staff was super friendly and the bread before the meal must be one of the best in town.",

I enjoyed the teas, although my husband wasn't to crazy about them (to each is their own).  The Bad:  This place is a bit more upscale then traditional restraunts. Prices for plates range in the 20+ neiboorhood.  It was also noisy.  The Ugly:           Slow service.  This place was busy , we did make reservations and we're seated promptly outside as requested. The location of the seating was close to the walkway along with many other tables. The servers rush powerfully through these isles making for a very uncomfortable hazardous experience to anyone seated along the walkway .    The service also wasn't great, after we were seated we weren't greeted for quite a while .   The wait in between was bad to, we waited almost 10 minutes to order desert, after ordering we waited another 15 minutes for a piece of cake. It was a bit irritating so we caught our server and said forget it , please just bring the check.  Then proceeded to once again wait a while for a check.    Overall yes I will be back, we enjoyed the environment and the food.  We will just be more cautious of our server.",

The Warm Margherita Dip is addicting and they make great cocktails! However, we had dinner in the dining room last night and it was a complete mess. We waited 25 minutes for a table, despite having a reservation. The male host really wasn't even apologetic. He had a huge attitude and said that reservations made on Open Table aren't \"guaranteed.\" That's funny because I've made reservations through Open Table for years, and at some of the nicest places on the Strip. Never heard that one before! Then dinner just took FOREVER and our waiter wasn't that friendly. It was at least 30 minutes before we were able to order. But like I said, we ended the night back in the bar area and they were incredibly accommodating and fun, everyone had a blast. Moral of the story: stick to Happy Hour at Brio. Go somewhere else for dinner.",

    "text": "Came here two days in a row! First on a Friday during Happy hour with Nieves D. One of the best HH I've had.   HH specials are for food & drinks and it's from $4-$6 which is a pretty good deal with the amount of food they give you! For foods we got Beef Cappaccio, Crispy Eggplant fries, black pepper shrimp, Crispy cheese ravioli, and Roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip. All oh so delicous! My favorite would have to be the Crispy eggplant fries which is pretty crazy because I do NOT like eggplant at all. Also I think the Crispy Cheese Ravioli was to die for. It wasn't too cheesy, it was the perfect amount of cheesiness!   For drinks we got White Peach Sangria, Sangria Rosa, & Mango Mojito. I really liked the Sangria Rosa. Now it's really not real sangria because real sangria is fruits marinated in wine but they just put some fruit in a cup & add wine with vodka. Still good tho.  Best bartender there, hands down is Geoffrey. He accomodated each of our needs. When the door was open and the wind was blowing our hair all over our faces, he shut the doors. We were right under the AC vents which was blowing cold a** air right on top of us making us shiver uncontrollably, he made the waiters turn the vents off. He also made us his speciality shots, on the house!   2nd time I went was the next day for brunch. Not as good as Happy Hour. I got the Salmon with Angel Hair with Lobster Bisque. Was not that good. It had a sauce that was kind of on the sour side.  & the lobster bisque was on the salty side. There was a fly buzzing around our table that was annoying me!   This place would be a solid 5 star rating for me if I did not come back for brunch the next day. None the less, I would probably return for HH again!",

When I questioned the host about it he said he wouldn't seat them inside until 9??? I told him we had made the reservation over 3 weeks ago. He said the app we used allows them to choose where they seat us. I told him to go ahead and seat the girls to which he replied something muffled but I heard the word \"rude\". I asked him to repeat himself and he doubled down saying clearly that he didn't like dealing with rude people. My husband and I had made a reservation on the same app for the same time but waited 15 more minutes to get our table. Turns out, my husband and I were afforded the opportunity to eat inside the restaurant. When we walked to our table, we noticed the place was empty. When we finished eating, there were still empty tables that hadn't been sat the whole time we were there. The girls outside were ignored most of their dinner. It looked like their server may have had her hands too full and the girls were cold. I'm bummed because there aren't many gluten free restaurants in town so we are already limited in our choices. Hence the month ahead reservation. At this point, there's no food in the world that tastes good enough for a crappy attitude employee. If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen. I guess they have enough business that they don't care if they lose any but we won't be back. Especially not for a special occasion. Tsk tsk",

Our entrees were the Chicken Limone and Cioppino. The Chicken was a large portion, very moist and perfectly cooked. The Cioppino arrived with 2 clams and 1 mussel that were not open. Our waitress apologized and reported the problem to the chef. She returned with a large plate of clams and mussels and again apologized. The Cioppino had a good variety of seafood and I would order it again. Overall Brio has a large menu with something for everyones taste. The service is professional and timely.",

I've noticed the portion size of the steaks shrinking over the last few months but this was nearly half the size it used to be! And the perfect medium rare at which it's typically served was more like well well. Dry, hard, completely void of flavor. I honestly don't think I'll ever order it again. And that's sad.

    "text": "Dined at Brio last night with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. When we checked in with the hosts, they asked us if we were celebrating anything and we informed them of our anniversary and they congratulated us and made us feel like we were royalty. They sat us in a nice big booth, so big we could have had other diners join us! I ate the Gorgonzola medallions and let me tell you, they were AMAZING! The meat was so tender and tasty my mouth is watering just talking about it. My husband ordered the Lobster and shrimp fettuccine and he loved it, he cleaned the plate off. the manager kiya (im sorry if i chopped that up) came up to our table while we were eating our entrees and checked on us and made sure everything was on point and she also congratulated us for our special occasion. Our waiter Pedro was one of the best servers ive ever had! He was attentive to us the moment we sat down, friendly, and made sure we had a great experience. The atmosphere at brio is lovely and comfortable. Im glad we decided to go to brio to celebrate, we definitely plan on going back very soon. Thank you Brio!!",

    "text": "I love going to Brio's happy hour ! There are select plates for $3.95 and mojitos for $5.00. I typically get the burger ,crispy shrimp and the pizza. It works out great because my coworkers can order one item each and we just share of each others plates. The Mojitos really hit the spot after a long day at work . They are nice and sweet! The patio area also has comfy couches you can sit on but I would suggest bringing sunglasses when dining in the patio area because the sun can be  quite strong. Brio has the cheapest Happy Hour I have experienced. You would think for the price they would skimp on the food but their portions are big enough to share!",

Was told their salmon is no longer fresh but farm raised,  server told us not to try their cod.  We ordered the fish and chips.  It came greasy, dipped in oil, and my husbands portion was partly frozen,  we were told it was fresh.  Yeah, freshly frozen.  I was afraid to order anything else but my husband opted for a cup of soup and I had the Caesars salad.  Part of the lettuce was wilted and couldn't eat it.  Hostess had the nerve to tell us we weren't charged for the fish and chips.  Why would we when it was so bad we couldn't eat it.   No care in their preparation and customer service sucked,  now I know why the place is empty but weeday nights. Horrible,",

When I ordered my usual dish (a pasta with chicken, pine nuts, tomatoes, idk what it's called but it's delicious) but asked for it without chicken, the waiter asked if I wanted to sub anything in it's place. Yes please! I asked for eggplant. I think I enjoyed it more with the eggplant than I ever did with the chicken. Hopefully if I end up at another location at some point they will do the same.",

From the moment we sat down the waiter and other staff were very attentive and made us feel welcomed.  From the outrageously good sourdough bread to the coffee at the end of the meal, we enjoyed our time together in a relaxing, beautiful atmosphere.

It's the place we bring the many guests that come to visit us in Las Vegas and they always tell us we made a great selection in choosing Brio. We recently went to Brio with friends from Florida. From the moment we were seated we were impressed with the attentiveness of our server Bre, the presentation and flavor of the food.  Our guests were raving about the service we received and the beautiful atmosphere . Having spent several years in Italy during my military career, I know excellent Italian food when I taste it and Brio has it all together. A nice  touch was added by Brio Manager Prado who stopped by to ask if we were satisfied with our service and food. With so many restaurants in the surrounding area to choose from, there is little wonder why we choose Brio when we are looking for an exceptional night out",

One of my favourite menu items I always get when I come in is the Carpaccio, very fresh , good quality beef with a small salad in the middle with crackers for the beef. I always try to leave room for the desserts as they always have something that catches my eye, and I'm usually not a sweets eater.  I really like the decorations and rustic Italian theme they have throughout the restaurant and the location is a very good location by nearby shops and restaurants.",

The menu is much smaller now than it used to be.   Usually, by 5pm, the place is crowded....not tonight....almost empty.

We were pleased to see that our table in the bar was of normal height and not having to sit at a bar height table. It actually felt like we were sitting in the restaurant. We started off with a Mimosa (I ended up having 2) and a Bloody Mary. At eight dollars a pop, the Bloody Mary was worth it and the Mimosa was pretty small. It was small but it was delicious. Fresh OJ, perfect amount of champs, too. Service was impeccable. Friendly, and quick. I ordered the vegetable omelette and my mom had the shrimp and polenta (what Brio calls grits). Both were very good. The omelette was straightforward, fresh veggies (mushrooms broccoli, peppers) in an egg white wrap. Served with fresh fruit which was fresh and crisp (pineapple, split grapes and strawberries). The brown sauce on the shrimp and grits was tasty. I'm giving this five stars because the service was excellent, the food was good and the drinks were delicious (albeit pricey). Total bill $61.00 + tip. Mother's Day, no reservation, Tivoli Village. Not bad. The overall experience on such a busy day could not have been better. We will definitely be back for their happy hour.",

But it felt like we didn't matter, kinda felt embarrassed bringing my mom here for her birthday.   Our server couldn't remember her name but she would forget things, they were having specials about steak and lobster that we were interested in she had told us she'll bring us the brochure never did, when we asked her for it she said there wasn't any left but I don't think she bothered to check... It took 40 minutes for our food to come out, at the 30 min mark she asked how was everything? All they brought out was our soup & salad, we had asked where our food has been she had no idea.. she knew we were frustrated so she had her manager Hannah apologize to us... but what's apologize going to do when everyone is starving on top of that getting horrible customer service?? She also kept refilling the coke my sister had ordered but not once refilled our water until we finally had ask the MANAGER.  Over all not a good experience coming from a restaurant like this...",

As an entree I got the Pasta Pesto, my father got the Pasta Brio (his go to), and our friends got the Ravioli di Bello, and Balsamic Braised Beef Short Rib.   The Pasta Pesto was amazing. Didn't want too hardy of a sauce and too much food so this dish was perfect. It had a light sauce (since usually pasta dishes have too much). The Pasta Brio...there is no wrong with this dish! Again, not an overwhelming sauce, portion is bigger than the Pasta Pesto, but perfect for eating it the next day. I can't vouch for the Short Rib and Ravioli, but I know our friends enjoyed it VERY much.   Our waiter was great. He made the experience even better. Great recommendations, very personable, made us feel very welcomed. Also, it was my Aunt's birthday 2 days prior and we mentioned it casually and he ended up bringing a small dessert for her without us even asking. Haven't had service like this for a while.",

We either sit on the patio or at the bar when Mandi is working. She's so awesome and pays equal attention to all of her guests. Very down to earth with a fun personality. Her espresso martinis are one of the best. Trust me on that! The food has never once when disappointing and the flour less chocolate cake is one of the best! Also to note they offer a rewards program! They have an AWESOME Happy Hour with food and drinks. Plz check out the menu as there is almost something for everyone. The patio is casual with tables and also offer laid back lounging with cushion patio furniture.   Also note the patio is not puppy friendly so no pooches allowed there.  Other then that this restaurant is great!",

Tonight I was pleasantly surprised.   The location is one of the best things about this restaurant. It is located in the heart of the beautiful Boca Park directly across from the complimentary valet in the south entrance round-about.   We ordered a round of the Watermelon Berry Mojito special. The drink was poured well with balanced flavors and fresh ingredients (not from a premixed bottle). The fresh watermelon in the drink was delicious. At only $5 a glass I was impressed.   They bring complimentary bread and Parmesan crackers with butter for the table and we ordered the red pepper bruschetta. The bruschetta was tasty and had a good bread to topping ratio and the bread wasn't overtly crusty which I appreciated.   I ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka which was a ricotta-filled ravioli in the shape of pouches with spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce and basil. Surprisingly the ravioli pouches were soft and creamy and appeared to be house made. The sauce was all around pretty tasty.   One coworker ordered the Crab Cakes which came with roasted vegetables, crispy fingerling potatoes, and creamy horseradish. He ate the whole thing and said he enjoyed it very much.   Our two other coworkers ordered the Pan Roasted Talapia and the Ravioli di Portobello. They said they liked it as well.  Our server Frank had great energy and had good suggestions for food and drinks. When we had completed our meal Frank took the time to shake each of our hands.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on their Happy Hour, which is one of my favorites in town! I usually go here whenever I just want to grab some refreshing sangrias and a quick bite with a friend.   Their HH is Monday-Friday 3:30-6:30pm and their reverse HH is 9pm-close. Keep in mind that it can get busy and seating at the bar, tables and booths are first come, first served. However, there have been a few times where it gets too packed in the bar area that the server will accommodate my party and I and we get to sit in the main restaurant area even though we are doing happy hour, which I really appreciate!   Their cocktails range from $4-6 and each food item on the HH menu range from $5-6 which are GREAT deals! The drinks are delicious and can be pretty strong (especially their sangrias lol) so they don't cheap you out on getting your alcohol on!   White peach sangria, the Moscow Mule, and the Black Raspberry Cosmo are my favorites and a must try!   For food: Very shareable! We usually like to just order a few items and will be stuffed by the end of the meal. Our favorites include the Black Pepper Shrimp, Brio Burger (omg so good!) and the Margherita Flatbread. All super yummy, filling, and satisfying.  Their service is always really great and they even have a rewards card that you might want to get to stack up some points.   With that said, if you're looking for a good place to get your Happy Hour on, definitely go to Brio!",

    "text": "Really 2.5 stars...  Ok. I would definitely say do not come on a holiday. We came here for Father's Day. I made reservations a good week in advance knowing that it would be busy. We were seated 10 min after our reservation time which was 11:30. Our server did take our drink order fairly quickly about 10 min after we were seated and took our food orders about 20 min after that. I knew it would be busy so I expected to have some kind of wait. We were seated right next to the kitchen and so I could see what was happening. We finally got our food around 1 pm but the part about it that bothered me was that I could see my kids pizza sitting underneath the light for a good 20-30 min. In my opinion, I feel that they should have served that pizza right away since they know it's for a kid. So we finally got our food and it seemed like everyone enjoyed their food minus my kids because the pizza was rock hard. I made a comment to the server about it but he didn't respond. Ok, it's whatever at this point. I think there should be a better system when it's a holiday or just in general. Food shouldn't be sitting underneath that hot lamp for the long anyways! Overall, service was lacking (I was trying to find my server a few times to ask about the pizza and to get refills) but we only saw him twice after he gave us our entrees. I'm assuming it's better when it's not a holiday but I would definitely skip it on a holiday.",

( wait, isn't that your job? To wait on guests?).... She seemed unfamiliar with the computer system and everything was just incredibly slow. Asked for bread about 5 times until asked a manager and he rudely brought it. Then another manager showed up to do nothing just to refill water. I'm not a chain restaurant type of person but was in the neighborhood and opted for this place as it looked nice from the outside. What a regretful experience. Food was mediocre, nothing special whatsoever.  So in a few words: Mediocre food Horrible service  Good bread Weak drinks Attitude from entire stuff. Do not waste your time and money going to Brio. They just do not have it together. Very unfortunate.  **** UPDATING THIS REVIEW TO A ZERO ****** nobody cares, nobody has reached out to me. No wonder their business is TERRIBLE.

    "text": "I feel I have given Tivoli Village long enough to get their shit straight. I don't know if the cost of rent in this place is so low it invites the kind of \"who cares if it fails\" culinary experimentation, or if it is so high restaurants are forced to try and sell you crap at a premium.   As an outside observer, it would seem as if Brio Tuscan Grille is the only restaurant that has managed to survive the Tivoli Village curse. Unfortunately, its mere survival does not preclude the fact that the restaurant as a whole is, well just blah. One look at the main photo on its Yelp page speaks volumes, the burger looks like something I would expect at my third cousin's \"backyard birthday bonanza\" for her 6 year old - they even cut it up in sections for the kiddies.  The food is not bad, and quite honestly I am impressed with the portion size of their appetizers, as they simply whet your appetite, not drown it. The unfortunate part is that the appetizers are only good if they are half off during happy-hour - I can't imagine paying full price for that. Which leads us to the rest of the menu, where the price points are where you would expect them to be if you were dining on the Strip. Not that I don't have great hope that Tivoli eventually becomes a great dining destination worthy of the high-dolar restaurants, but if it is Friday night and your place is half empty - well I'm just saying.  The service itself was okay, but one doesn't feel an abundance of warmth from the staff. Don't get me wrong, they did everything right and in a timely manner, it's just that there was no warmth there.  I won't go as far as to say that Brio Tuscan Grille is a disappointment, I just can't imagine waiting in line for this place, which is probably why there isn't one.",

They take both reservations and walk-ins so lucky for us since we didn't make a reservation. The estimated wait time was 80 minutes? But we actually got in earlier, probably 30 to 40 minutes?  Anyways... We ate outside near a heat lamp which wasn't too bad in today's weather. We ordered calamari as our appetizer which was fine. I mean, it's calamari... Not much else to it. For our entrees, I got the pasta brio which is grilled chicken with rigatoni. My boyfriend got campenelle carbonara which kind of resembled chicken Alfredo. I also got a flirtini - probably won't get that again. It resembled cough syrup to me, but that could just be my taste buds.  All in all, for $67 this was definitely not a bad place for a date. We will probably check out the one in Town Square once the weather gets warmer since they have a fire pit outside.  Happy eatings!",

They were in an italian mood, but I was limiting carbs due to the night's Yelp Pizza Party, so I did not partake of any pasta during my visit.   Service was fairly good- our server was very friendly and made a bunch of helpful chit-chat with us, mostly bonding with my dining companions over their love of carbonara, and discussing the best places in LV to get it. I appreciated his honesty in that he did not try to BS us about how the dish here is the best there is or anything, but he did say it was good- he personally does not like the use of spinach in the dish, preferring beans, but it's not offered that way here.  As it is, I debated between a few dishes- the shrimp mediterranean in particular, caught my eye. But I ultimately opted for the soup and salad combo, with the wedge and the lobster bisque- the salad arrived already doused in a sea of dressing, which surely took it far beyond the listed calorie counts. The bisque was an odd dish- the first bite wasn't that great to me, and I considered asking to switch it out for the tomato, but as I ate more of the dish it grew on me. Guess I'm just not a lobster bisque person? Duly noted.  My coworkers both opted for the carbonara- and both were underwhelmed with it. The dishes were huge, and they easily could have shared a single order instead of getting separate dishes, but one dish had overcooked pasta that was borderline mushy while the other was a good al dente. Both ladies were underwhelmed by their selection and had buyer's remorse, of a sort- commenting that they wished they'd gone with their original choices, but felt like the dish would be better here given the conversation with our server. Womp womp.  Seems like this place is best for a happy hour visit- I may need to take advantage of that, but I don't think I'm likely to return for lunch.",

    "text": "Let's get one thing straight - I love Brio at Town Square, so after going to the Kidville CYME today (8/22/11,) I headed over here at 11:30 AM. The place was pretty dead, save for a handful of tables. Literally, you could count the tables that were full on one hand. My three siblings and I were sat at a booth right next to the kitchen (annoying) and given menus.   Our waiter would periodically pop in to say that he would be with us in a minute and after a little over 10 minutes, we finally got to order our waters. 5-7 minutes later, he ask if we still needed time with the menu or if we were ready to order. We were ready. After the wait, my sister and I were talking about just getting up and leaving - it's aggravating to be discriminated against because we're young. Don't put us in the back by the kitchen because we have two kids with us and don't ignore us because you think you won't get a good tip. Bad service, like what was exhibited, equals a bad tip.  Anyway, I ordered the lunch portion of the sweet potato & chicken risotto with the bistecca salad ($12.95.) My sister got the fettuccine rustica ($9.95) and then our younger siblings got the kid's ravioli ($4.95) and the kid's fettuccine alfredo ($4.50.)   My food was okay but extremely salty/ msg-ish. It had that overwhelming umami flavor that comes with excessive msg so that made me leery. I actually got really full quite quickly and couldn't finish it all. Also, the risotto was kind of unappetizing with the cubes of not soft sweet potato and green beans. It was edible, but I wouldn't order it again. My sister complained that her pasta was also extra salty and she left most of the \"goodies\" in her bowl. The kids liked their pasta - it actually came in the same size bowls as our meals with the same sized portions. I was actually worried that the waiter didn't write that they were kids' meals.    We got one water refill about 5 minutes before we got the check. We would have ordered dessert but my sister said she was really sick of constantly waiting for our waiter so I paid $40 and we bounced. Go to Brio at Town Square at Happy Hour if you want a great deal and great service. Come to Brio at Tivoli Village if you want to be ignored and leave unsatisfied with your meal.",

Both of these items were DELICIOUS. My husband had a cesaer salad, the filet mignon, and the fingerling potatoes. His steak was devoured pretty quick, but I did get a chance to try his potatoes and they were great. For dessert, we got the dolcini trio consisting of the caramel marscapone cheesecake, creme brulee, and a seasonal banana pudding. The pudding was my favorite-so good! Our server was Jenny and despite the fact that they were extremely busy and she was hustling, she never let our drinks get low and she was very attentive. We will definitely be back in the future. We had a great experience!",

They were located on Rampart Blvd in the Tivoli Village in Las Vegas.  We ordered 3 appetizers and a couple of Martinis:  Spinach, Garlic and Artichoke Dip:  The dip came in a small bowl with parmesan flat bread.  Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant:  The bartender recommended this dish and it was very good.  The egglplant was lightly breaded.  We needed some complimentary bread to soak up all the sauce.  Shrimptini:  We ordered one each.  There were 8 good sized shrimp on a bed of lettuce in a martini glass.  My friend ordered a Pomegranatini with a slice of lime and a Flirtini with a cherry.   She liked the Pomegranatini better and would order it again.  We would order all 3 appetizers again and will be back soon.",

When the food came out the steak was cold and the salad was soggy like it had been plated and left too long. The 2 pasta dishes we ordered were fine.   In years of dining out, I've never had to speak to the manager of a restaurant to complain about service. The manager wasn't very helpful either and said she would check with us to make sure everything was ok but never saw her again.  The restaurant was obviously understaffed and mismanaged.",

Server was nice, complimentary bread, to be honest, I touched a bit and did not even pay attention onto. bread was cold, and hard. And it did not go well with butter either. But what made us our day was the main dishes.  Vodka Pasta - Flavor that I never tried it before. Creamy, flavorful, usually if you eat pasta, it sometimes does not have flavors that smothered into the pasta. At least the pasta that I tried, it was just so good and the cheese inside really harmonized well with the pasta and sauce. Which was one of the best pasta I have tried.  Fillet Mignon - Ordered Medium Rare, and it was cooked perfectly. I have never tried fillet mignon that is as juicy and tender as the one that I have tried here. And also, their side dish, I don't know what its called, but side of the potato and sauce on the top was just a killer. Something that you must try.  overall, it was a great experience and after I have tried all the other steakhouse, I will for sure come back to eat pasta and steak again.",

Our food was served pretty quickly, and most importantly, it was delicious. We split an appetizer of bacon and tomato jam bruschetta with ricotta cheese and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could have taken a jar of that jam home with me. It was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. For my main course I had Gorgonzola-crusted lamb chops. They were cooked medium well, I asked for medium, but they were still great. The Gorgonzola crust was delicious and the mashed potatoes on the side were also quite good. It's a little pricey for brunch, but if you're not on a budget this is an excellent choice.",

    "text": "I wish there was a way to leave minus reviews.  Much against my better judgement I went back to this restaurant with my 25.00 gift card sent to me by supposed manager Kaya Bozhinova due to my horrific experience in June.  Not very generous (after dropping 200.00)  but what the heck.  Everything that could be wrong went wrong.  We had a reservation but once again the receptionist and greeter tried to seat us at the bar at the far empty end.  When we objected they magically found us a seat in the main dining room saying it was full, which it was not, there were 3 empty tables.  When we asked to speak to the manager Kaya came and apologized and asked if there was anything she could do and said she had been out of town so people didn't know how to be hosts or seaters?  Odd (later we were told there were two managers, one man and one woman? I think they just pick on people to be managers if customers complain)  She offered us a drink, I don't drink so I asked for an appetizer.  The drink and appetizer took 25 minutes to come.  We then asked to share a meal the meal came and it was not split we had to ask for plates and split it ourself.  We never got bread or water refills.  Now comes the really fun part when the bill came the \"generous\" gift card registered as 20.00 not 25.00 and the drink was on the bill.  Once again we called for the manager.  She said oh did you get 2 drinks? No!!! Then I showed her my email that stated the gift card was for 25.00 and she tried to blame the poor waitress.  How could the waitress do that it was a plastic card you ran through a machine.  In a haughty nasty tone she said she would give us the whole meal for free, since the balance was 2.00 that was once again really kind.  She also said see you again, NEVER EVER WILL WE SEE HER OR THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.  The food has also fallen in quality.  Go to Mangiannos.",

My date ordered the tilapia which was cooked perfectly.    All with a few glasses of sangria thrown in made for a lovely date.",

    "text": "The wifey wanted to come back to Brio after her and her girlfriend came the week before for Happy Hour.  Honestly, it was just OK.  I agreed to go because since its opening I still hadn't been to Tivoli Village.  I'm for 'yuppie-ism' in many cases, and seeing how rich people sometimes like to spend their money just amazes me (and somewhat annoys me at the same time).  But to each their own.  Who am I to tell the local Summerlin millionaire that the restaurant chains they visit are often vastly inferior to the local Mom & Pop Italian deli down the way?  They'll probably just scoff then go back to their yuppie gym (I'm looking at you David Barton) where apparently only people with 8+ abs, and Armani workout clothes can sweat it out.  Yes, I am in fact wearing last, last, last season Adidas sneakers (but in my defense they are a rare blue pair) and a pleather jacket.    Tivoli Village was nice, but I was right in that it caters to specific clientele.  I like window shopping (unlike my homeboy 50 Cent) and wow, 'what-I-cannot-afford-even-if-I-tried' syndrome took over.  But I digress on back to eating (and fantasizing I was P-Diddy's hidden 16 year old bastard son).  Seems like Brio is one of the only restaurants that has survived the turmoil of Tivoli Village.  A number of eateries here have come and gone over the year.  Now I can only comment on their late night Happy Hour after 9 PM in the bar area.  I will have to try the regular restaurant some other time if we ever go back.  The hostesses were nice, showed us exactly where the bar area was in no time.  Seats were open, and we were told to sit anywhere in the bar for Happy Hour.  We chose a nice little table towards the wall section.  Our waitress was quick, and asked if we were interested in some drinks or if we were going to stick around for Happy Hour.  We told her we indeed there for Happy Hour and were immediately offered one of their bar plate menus.    There are a decent number of dishes available during Happy Hour, around 10 or so.  The pricing is good, between $4 - $6 each.  There are a number of drink specials as well.  I stuck with a Peroni beer for $4, not exactly a value, but apparently it's cheaper than normal.  Really?  Damn markup must be massive!  The wifey and I wanted to share the Black Pepper Shrimp plate, but according to our waitress they were out of the cream sauce for it.  Huh?  How hard is it for a kitchen to whip up a cream sauce exactly?  I certainly hope you have an ITALIAN kitchen that can make cream sauces all day long!  Alfredo, anyone?  Was just beyond me but OK.  We opted for the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip instead.  We also got an order of Beef Carpaccio, and two BRIO burgers.  Plates took around 20 minutes to arrive, average for most restaurants.  But it wasn't exactly busy when we were there so I don't know what the holdup was.  I gotta say though that our plates weren't exactly news to write home about.  Yes, I know it's Happy Hour, and yes I know the pricing is considered 'cheap', but come on now.  These were some ugly looking plates!  Poorly executed for the most part.  The Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with flatbread triangles was alright.  It seemed to be sitting under the heat lamp for a bit on the long side, top layer of it was hard.  It tasted ok, but should I be ashamed to say it tastes like something I can pick up at Costco?  Let me get on with the BRIO burger.  Wow.  $5 for this?  A thin burger patty with Provolone and roasted tomato mayo on what looks like a Costco hamburger bun?  And a side of housemade 'chips', once again, that could be from Costco?  Now before you get your panties in a twist, I adore Costco and shop there weekly (and drink a kale shake almost daily).  I'm just saying, if I can make the same stuff from ingredients at Costco, why go to Brio?  Why?  And this BRIO burger was plated funny too.  A 5-year old can make a plate better than this.  The burger, no lettuce, no tomato?  Cut into four pieces, and chips stuffed in the middle of the plate?  Rookies!  It didn't taste the greatest either.  Burger was overcooked and dry, the cheese was near non-existent, the roasted tomato mayo was barely there, and there was too much bun!  For the price I could have gone to Wendy's right nearby and gotten a bigger burger.  Just so-so for me.  The best item of the night was the Beef Carpaccio.  Ultra thin slices of raw beef, topped with dressed field greens, capers, a mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  This plate was DELICIOUS.  Beef was nice and cold, greens had great crunch, capers and the mustard aioli added a nice bite, and the cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor.  We heartily ate this up.  All for $4!  Next time I won't waste any effort and just get two orders of carpaccio.  And maybe a Peroni.  Rant done Brio.",

The appetizers we had were the eggplant topped with shrimp and the calamari. They were large servings and very delicious. Good wine, good food and good coversation was had by all. The resturant has a large dining room with adequate seating for larger groups all the way down to couples and family dining.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been to Brio in Tivoli Village and Town Square for happy hour, lunch and dinner many times over the yrs, sometime with our friends, too, and always have good experiences.   This evening my wife and I went for an early dinner. The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who \"never seem to have to work!\"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)   The wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!  BTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH!   For dinner, my wife ordered the \"Sliced steak salad\" (15.95), and I had the \"Mediteranian shrimps\" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good!   Our sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!  During our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice!   The Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS.  - My friends say, it's like dining in a \"Mid-Upscale\" restaurant at Olive Garden prices.   For me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!

It seemed a bit more intimate than the town square one.   As for food we shared the tomato mozzarella salad, beef carpaccio and black pepper shrimp. I honestly loved everything I ate. The salad was very fresh and well balanced on the ingredients. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spice to it. The carpaccio was delicious and not too thin like you tend to get at some other restaurants.  100% I cannot wait to come back again and try more of the menu options. You also can never go wrong with $5 drink specials. Thank you Brio!",

    "text": "We came in the other evening for a birthday celebration. The ambiance in this restaurant is nice, one of our waiters was friendly but beyond that all bets are off. We ordered a ceasar salad to start and while the dressing was decent it was clear that the bagged romaine was not fresh.  I ordered the Shrimp Capri which read on the menu jumbo shrimp with a sauce of some sort of lemon sauce which was practicall non existent. The so called, wild caught jumbo shrimp were not fresh. The cassarecce pasta was good.  If in fact these shrimp were jumbo I'd expect to get 4-5 shrimp but these shrimp weren't at all jumbo....yet still there were 5 shrimp on the plate.   My grandfather ordered the chicken Milanese which clearly was derived from previously frozen breaded chicken. While it was Romano chicken I'd expect a restaurant of this caliber isn't purchasing pre breaded chicken.   My fiancee ordered the chicken Milanese....her chicken was tasty and tender but her vegetables were packed with liquid so I had to assume those were also previously frozen.  Far from fresh, not the best tasting food, you'd have to offer us another run for free to try Brio again. Too bad as we were really excited to try this place",

Chef Michael personally brought us bread to start. We ordered salads (sounds so boring I know) but trust and believe me that they were really really good. I had the wedge salad for which they make there own parmesan dressing. It was delicious to say the least. I was hesitant to order because salads can be hit or miss (emphasizing on the miss) but I was genuinely very impressed. Nice presentation, great flavor, crazy good dressing. I'll admit there was nothing revolutionary about it but that's ok, I felt warm and comfy after eating and that's all that matters, right??? The bartender was our server and he was very attentive to our needs. My company and I both had stiff drinks for under 7 bucks each, oh and water too(go water, go water). After the meal Chef Michael came back by with more bread!!! Im trying to diet so reluctantly, I declined. What a nice touch though, I love to see a chef popping out into the restaurant to check on guests. Nice place, I will be back.",

We had a large party so we had two servers, Frank & Joe and they were both extremely friendly, polite and on top of everything.  The food was incredible.. it not only looked beautiful on the plates but everything was piping hot and full of flavor.  Usually when we go out with large parties something goes wrong, the service lacks or food orders get messed up, food items take too long to come out, or they come out cold, or you can't get your drinks refilled fast enough, etc.. which is why I felt compelled to write this review.. everything was perfect on that night and the staff should be recognized for doing such a wonderful job on a night that meant so much to our family.",

Our server and manager both were very flip when we asked if they were short on staff.  \"That's how we do things\".  Our server told us that having a section to himself was how he made his money.  Too bad he doesn't understand that a lot of people tip on the level of service, we did accordingly.  People also come back when the food is hot when it is supposed to be hot (soggy steak salad with cold steak).  We have  a lot of choices of restaurants, it will be awhile before we choose this one again.",

    "text": "Ummm... Five stars for Brio's happy hour, am I taking crazy pills?!  It feels odd, but I must have hit this place at the right time because the service was incredibly fast, the food was beyond expectations, and the price was stellar, $3.95 for a Margherita flatbread pizza? I'm in!  I came here after working an event, just looking for a quick snack before hitting the long road back to Henderson. I bellied up to the bar and almost fell off my chair when I peeked at the menu saw the prices; the most expensive item was the Brio Burger for $6. I didn't order this, but instead went with Black Pepper Shrimp, Beef Carpaccio, Tuscan Tots and a Margherita Flatbread.   Everything was very good, but the Black Pepper Shrimp was the winner of the meal. Seared Romano crusted eggplant with seared shrimp on top and some insane cream sauce, definitely not a low calorie option, but worth totally worth it. The beef Carpaccio is must order, it wasn't too fatty and cut paper thin it will literally melt in your mouth.   The Tuscan Tots were sneaky. I was thinking these would be your basic tater tots, but they are small mashed potato balls that are coated in breadcrumbs and filled with bacon, mozzarella cheese and fried, I'm done. The Flatbread pizza was great, covered in fresh veggies and flavorful basil, but compared to everything else it was probably least favorite out of the bunch, but still worth ordering.    The price point was the best part of the whole meal, with two cocktails each and with all the food mentioned prior, our tab didn't break $40.   Happy Hour goes from 3:30 - 6:30pm and then again from 8pm to close. Great atmosphere, no smoking and great food.... duh, I'll be back for sure!",

Their happy hour deal is AMAAAAAAZING, since you can try their signature dishes for a potion of the price. Too bad it's only on weekdays, but it is definitely worth checking out.  I was not fond of the alcoholic beverages whatsoever...the mojito didn't taste like a mojito. They hadn't crushed the mint leaves so the flavor was one noted. We had to ask for mint too, since there were two leaves in there.   The Manhattan was just terrible.   Let me move onto the food though... Flat bread pizza - 5/5 stars Shrimp and zuchinni - 5/5 stars  Beef carpaccio- 5/5 stars   Everything else was 3-4 stars delicious!",

The portions are large, so I often just get two appetizers.  They have both indoor and sheltered outdoor seating, and can accommodate large groups.  If you get a loyalty card (no cost), you can receive email offers for discounts and special meals.  Both the Las Vegas and Miami locations are equally good, and both are located near excellent shopping, making them great choices for lunch when I am running errands on a weekend.  Both locations also have valet parking.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this isn't just your average Yelp review, we actually had our wedding reception at this Brio location this past Sat, Aug 16th 2014, and we could not be happier. We live in Los Angeles and were planning a wedding in Las Vegas, so I was very nervous about planning this via email and telephone, however the GM was extremely kind and helpful. First off, lets start with the fact that this location doesn't even have a \"wedding\"/or banquet room, the first time I called the manager informed me about their other location closer to the strip that had space to accommodate large parties and I explained to her that because our ceremony was in Summerlin, we wanted our reception to be there too so that guests wouldn't have to drive so far back and forth from the strip. She completely understood and welcomed our business. So, instead of taking up the majority of their restaurant on a Saturday night, they gave us the patio as well as a wrap around lounge area. Again, I was a little skeptical about the idea of my reception being on a patio, but we were running out of time and options within our budget and we booked Brio mostly because of their kind professionalism and because the food sounded delicious.  So, we began planning our menu, I emailed the GM probably around 20-30 times in the course of 3 months, and every time she responded within 24 hours and never seemed bothered or irritated. She allowed us to have table decorations and when I explained I was worried my family member would miss the ceremony due to setting up the tables, she offered to have some employees set up the dining area for us, and never even mentioned a service charge. Amazing. Also, she accommodated us with our menu choices completely and everyone in at our reception said the food was amazing and that they were going to look up the nearest Brio in their areas.   I'll save you all the sob story, but basically we had some hiccups at our ceremony (insane photographer) and we were about ready to tell the limo driver to just keep driving and not even take us to our reception when we pulled up to this amazingly beautiful, twinkly lit patio that took both of our breath away. We ended up having the most amazing reception. We danced. We drank. We laughed. We cried. It was everything I wanted for my wedding and I have Brio to thank for it. Not only did our reception at Brio make up for a pretty lousy ceremony, they also told us \"not to rush\" and to \"stay as long as we're enjoying ourselves\". That is amazing. The servers not only went above and beyond all night long, they were attentive, personable, extremely quick and one of the girls even danced with my brother who has Down's Syndrome. She was such a sweetheart. I have never experienced such great service along with such amazing food in such a beautiful restaurant. Brio truly has it all. We are eternally grateful because you gave us the most beautiful wedding reception we could have asked for.",

Food was OK but lacked flavor. Mine was too salty and wife's plate was a little under-seasoned. Kid's portions are gigantic. Not that I mind taking stuff to go but I could split one portion for both of them.   I think I'll take Brio off my \"occasion dining\" list for sometime. At least this particular location.",

I still think their Sunday Brunch is solid and the dinner options are fine.  There are certainly better options out there for both.  Their wine list has always been stale and conventional.  The most disappointing thing is their changing quality and quantity of HH items.  HH was the best thing they had going for them.  The first month that their Happy Hour was going the portions were much larger and it seemed as if more care was taken...when their burger was first added it was great for the price.  The patty has changed and it is now a crappy burger covered up in a good I-N-O style burger spread.",

    "text": "I hate to say this, but this place is lame.  We made reservations for 5 at 8:30. We came in and waited to be seated. There was no host/hostess at the front. Waited for a solid 10 minutes and finally 2 hostesses came and apologized for the wait. Why are there 2 hostesses if they are BOTH going to be occupied at the same time? Fine whatever.  Got seated outside. We made reservations for 5. Got four plates and sets. I asked for one more set... And I got the \"Oh did I miss a set?\" Yes you did. No biggie.   Service is really bad. Not even mediocre, bad. Waited forever to get our orders in, very disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, but 20 mins into it (after we were served calamari and carpacciio, the only decent items on the menu), they came in to let me know they ran out. 20 mins later? Whatever, fine. They told me they could make me a spaghetti with bolognese sauce. I opted for that. Everyone's meal came earlier and they all waited for mine to come out (even though I insisted they go ahead and eat). I finally got this \"bolognese\" but it was like a pasta stew. Everyone knows bolognese is meat sauce and it's not supposed to be mushy and soggy and filled with sauce, but meat. It looked like they threw on the lasagna ragu. It was terrible! Even the meat of the sauce was not edible.  At this point I was done. My mother insisted that I let them know I didn't get what I ordered. I assumed that my voice wouldn't be heard considered the already bad service... but the Manager was the only redeeming quality of this joint: She offered an apology (that's all I expected), and dessert around the table. She didn't have to do that and that was nice. For that, they get one star.  Without it, it wouldn't be anything.  I would NOT come back here again and do not recommend this place for anyone who wants a romantic or nice italian experience. Bad food, bad service.",

The portion is twice what any natural human being should eat the pasta is over cooked and ingredients are unbalanced - too little pasta too much cheese and sauce.

In the beginning we were told 30-40 minute wait and since it's Homecoming weekend in Vegas, we understood and the lady manager took my name and handed me a pager. We sat RIGHT OUTSIDE and waited not long after were pleasantly surprised that another woman manager with a bun came up to us with a flatbread to take a piece while we waited. We were so grateful that she not only offered us a snack, but thanked us for waiting. Patronage is a huge thing in local restaurants and being thanked for waiting is a rare commodity.  Well an hour passes and we finally get up And walk inside. We ask how much longer to be told they were paging us for 15 mins?? Apparently they gave us a broken pager that was fully lot and functional. Thanks to the First Lady manager. We're surprised at this considering there were 4 hostesses and 2 managers, not one of them would've walked outside to call our name?   At that point they handed my boyfriend a new charger and expected us to wait more. At that point I walked over to the bar and say down. THANK THE SERVING GODS for Kelly at the bar because she made up for my irritated and highly agitated night. 2 stars is for her and her ONLY. No more Tivoli Village Brio for us.",

Then server asked if there was something else he would like and he said the salmon and she said sorry we are out of salmon!!!! So we got up and left and went to Cheesecake Factory. Won't be going back to Brio's until they make necessary changes to get their loyal customers to come back.

    "text": "Average at best.  We went during brunch on a Sunday and stood at the front counter for a good five minutes without a greeting.  Then when we finally got seated and it took another 10 minutes just to be greeted by a waitress.  From there we get our menus and complimentary bread and wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to deliver our drinks and take our orders.    Next, we were not given silverware or plates for our bread.  And unbelievably our waitress could not be found and was not even in eyesight until 15 minutes later.  So we ended up eating bread off of our menus (which she for some reason didn't even take away once we ordered) with no napkin or anything.    The utensils finally came along with our meals.  The food itself, an omelette and brunch quinoa salad, was just alright.  The portion size was good but the eggs themselves didn't seem anything too great and probably not worth $11 each.  I guess you're paying for the ambiance of Tivoli in that case.  Buta gain the waitress struggled when we asked for some extra condiments and it took her so long to track some down that we were halfway done with our meals by then.  We overheard the waitress talking to another party about getting some food comped since her service was so bad for them, so I'm guessing we just got stuck with a new waitress who was having a bad day or something; but still, it gave the restaurant a very poor first impression from my point of view from her service.    I hear the Happy Hour is worthwhile so I could be back for a drink or two in the future, but it's not likely I'll ever come back for a full meal, especially at the Tivoli location.",

    "text": "In a word: disappointing.  In two words: very disappointing.    Food: average.  Typical BRIO (one step up from Olive Garden). Service: bad.  Really bad.  UNFORGETTABLY bad.  When in college I worked as a waiter.  I well know how hard the job can be.  And I give food servers every \"break\" I can.  But ours was just plain BAD!  Yet, I sense, it was not entirely his fault.  He was not well trained.  I dislike Yelp reviews that drone on about every detail of one's unpleasant experience.  So I won't.  But, in summary: waiter had no knowledge of the wine list, did ask if we wanted our salads before or with entree (we chose before) but forgot all about bringing them and, finally (without asking) cleared the table of bread, butter, and my dining companion's plate long before I was finished eating.  (He asked if I wanted my \"leftovers\" to go while I was still chewing my last mouthful!)    I chose to dine at BRIO specifically because I love their chopped salad.  Oh, how I wish I had had the opportunity to enjoy one.",

Our waiter took his time to let his General Manager Jesse know it was our first time and he personally came to greet us and suggested his favorites on the menu. The food was amazing! To top it off Jesse even had dessert sent to us on the house. BEST cheesecake you will ever taste! I will definitely be coming back!  Thank you Jesse and your team for exceeding our expectations!",

I ordered the pasta  bolognese and a Ceasar salad. Ceasar dressing should have a bite of garlic and the saltiness of anchovies. This mess tasted like it was pre made and sat in the walk-in for a few hours. Equally tasteless, the pasta. Here's a thought- garlic. It's Italian food for Christ's sake. And if your diner does not eat the salad, before removing it, ask if it was ok. And when you sweep your section, look at all your tables to see if your guests need anything before running back to the kitchen. That's just common waitress sense.",

Calamari is crunchy and very flavorful. It comes with two sauces, one being marinara. Yum! I usually order the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini. People, this entree is beyond this world. My taste buds went on a ride and never came back! Also, the lobster bisque is quite fascinating. Best I've ever tasted.  Service is delightful. I usually get the same server which is just my luck. Happy to say I'm pleased with the staff here.  The price is a bit on the higher end, although you pay for what you eat. Which is royalty.  There is free WiFi, no password needed. No bike racks nearby. Outdoor seating is optional. Reservations aren't required but they always help expedite your seating.  Overall, I'm pleased with the service, food, and amenities here. I'll be back in a few weeks.",

He was on it all service long with us.  We ordered calamari and lobster bisque to start along with their bread.  Both dishes came out quickly and tasted good.  Frank made ordering fun and easy.  Called all the ladies dolls and sweetie.  He was just on his game.  I thought this was just a show because its MOTHERS DAY.  But we all were very impressed.  He was a veteran and served our country and mentioned that doing this was something he loved better and I can see it with every table he served.  He sincerely loves his job.  Every dish we ordered was delicious and no complaints from Grandma, who is always the hardest critic.  Shrimp and grits was a hit!!! Seafood pasta was tasty.  Being a busy day, Frank checked in on us frequently refilling our drinks, and was on top of it during our service.  We found out through conversation he had a 1 month old daughter at home and then we knew why he was soo good to our son and always had a compliment for him.  He even brought out some mash potatoes for him without us asking.    The food was great today but the service was even better.  Thank you FRANK L for making our MOTHER'S DAY even more special for us.  If you decide to eat here, ask to be seated in FRANK L's section.  You will enjoy your experience so much more.",

I also enjoy the one at Town-square me and my friends enjoy sitting at the bar sharing a good bottle of wine. However I've never felt so disrespected or discriminated before like I did tonight. Me and my girlfriend sat at the bar at Tivoli village around 7 pm the restaurant was pretty busy, the bar was empty, so it looked like a good idea we were completely ignored by the bartender a least for 10 minutes. When he decide it to talk to us he was very rude, he didn't even introduce him self. He just said are you guys ready? He proceeded to put our order in with no other attempt to talk to us. At that point we decided that we no longer wanted to eat at the bar. We talked to the hostess and moved to the patio, he was making an angry face we can clearly see he was upset!! After we moved outside no one ever checked on us not even one time. His name was Joe. The WORST bartender we ever had! (Tivoli village ) after we complained to the manager (Joe) he comp our salads but he said we will have to pay for the wine. Terrible service, shame on you management team and bartender!! We were not looking for a free meal but rather a great dinner with friends!!",

We were immediately impressed with the set-up and interior of the restaurant. Compared to the Town Square (Las Vegas) location, it has an \"open\" feeling since the whole seating area of the restaurant is under one beautiful canopy of drapes. The outdoor seating has a beautiful view of the center of Tivoli Village.  I thoroughly enjoy both Las Vegas locations and merely choose one based on where I am in the valley at the time!",

Our server couldn't be bothered to open the door and actually come to the table but would just stick his head out, yelling... Didn't offer boxes, ask about the food or even return quickly after asking for the check... My son hated his food and we would have ordered something else had the waiter checked back before we'd finished eating...I could maybe understand it if he was super busy but it wasn't busy at all!! Upon returning after running my credit card he made a big show of shaking each of our hands which was weird because until then he couldn't have cared less about our service or food. Maybe he hoped the show would make us forget the terrible service... It didn't! Sadly I left a 15% tip, which I never do but I don't even think that was deserved. Won't be going back!",

I can never remember which pasta dishes I get when I go for lunch/dinner but I have never been disappointed. They also have an outdoor seating area.   My boyfriend and I have a favorite dish there which is the seared steak salad or sometimes for a healthier version we substitute it the steak for salmon. great mixture of greens and the dressing they use is so delicious.

There was a live band playing in one one coutyards with people mingling and dancing.  Very cool.  If and when additional phases of this complex are completed, it will be a wonderful destination.  The restaurant carried the theme of the complex, with beautiful flooring, stonework and large spaces.  The vibe, ambience, seating and service were all excellent.  We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation and had to wait 15 minutes for our table, the only drawback to an otherwise perfect evening.  The wine was priced reasonably asnd the beer was ice cold.  We ordered the quartet of brushetta.  It was beautifully plated, visually appealing and delicious.  My wife had the penne alla vodka, which she really enjoyed.  I had the veal Marsala, with a very dark, rich sauce that was a bit too thick for my taste but otherwise excellent.  We look forward to going again.",

As for HH, this is one of the better.   The offering of drinks tend to sway my judgement. The Town Square location lacks drink offerings. For $5, a decent size list of specialty cocktails has something for most.   The two food items I ordered was enough to tide me over. The beef carpaccio with mixed greens is one of my regularly favorites. The shrimp with eggplant was a solid option as well. As an in between snack to banish hunger, a better deal is hard to come by.   One drink and two appetizers for $14. Check please.",

The food is always amazing, and that goes for the happy hour food as well. Im glad i live close by now so i can visit more regularly here.",

Unfortunately after she took the order, she returned much later to ask if we would like dessert. I guess what happens between the initial order and the time they are ready to clear the table for the next party does not matter much. The guy who actually delivers the lunch was ill-prepared to serve us because the table was covered with dirty dishes from the appetizer round. Hello? Clear the table and then bring the meal. Got busboys? Use them. It also never pays to respond to the typical question, \"Is there anything else you need?\" because you never get what you need. A simple request for red pepper flakes, which should be within reach of every table in an Italian restaurant, was completely ignored. I guess he had other things to do such as deliver water to each new customer regardless whether the water is requested or not. (I thought there was a water shortage in this town. Never mind....) Considering the location (Tivoli Village, the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Summerlin) the service was at best cordial, but hectic. Maybe adding more staff during the Christmas season, as many offices are having their office parties these days, would be helpful. I am sure we will be back, as I say for the great food, but dear friends, bring your own red pepper flakes if you like your food spicy.",

My son came into town, and we picked him up at his hotel on the Strip, and drove the whole way out here because I had bragged on how good it was.  Well,needless to say, the service was terrible.  The food was mediocre.  We were overcharged ($15) on the bill - and we will NOT be back.  The bill was over $100 for 3 people, and the Pasta Brio which is usually quite good was dry, unflavorful, and very disappointing.  My son also ordered the Brio Pasta, based on my previous recommendation, and he did not even finish the dish.  We had to ask fro butter and bread three different times, and never received it.  Also, if you are desirous of traditional Bruschetta, do NOT order the Bruschetta Quattro - it is bruschettas with red peppers all over them.  YUK!!  When I order Bruschetta,I want chopped tomatoes, cheese,cilantro and italian seasonings on toasted bread.    I was embarrassed to have bragged about this restaurant that I have been to MANY times in the past.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone now.  I know my son was disappointed....and it made me sad because I wanted to enjoy a wonderful evening with him.  Shame on Brio for their decline.  We will NOT recommend or be back.  RIP OFF!",

    "text": "I figured this was another one of those places that spent more money on decor than quality of food boy was I surprised.  We started with the bruschetta sampler I snagged a steak one with tomatoes parm and a nice hint of balsamic that was great the best thing I had that night.  Also got one of tomato and goat cheese ones which were pretty tasty too.  Next a salad with their creamy parm dressing which was balanced very well also.  Just enough cheese, onions, maters it was great.  Some others had the lobster bisque and said it was fishy even to seasoned fish eaters.  On to the pasta they had a fruit of the sea special which was great hint of spicy red pepper flakes a light sauce that didn't drown out the seafood.  I did have one problem with the dish I got 4 mussels maybe 3 oz of fish. Cut to the size of baby scallops and the scallops that were supposed to be in there were AWOL which is probably why the fish was cut that way.  Now the 4 shrimp I got in there were tender tasty and perfectly cooked just like the rest of the seafood were great but for me I would like to see alot more fruit of the sea. Service was friendly but not best I've had.  Overall a good place great tasting food and one of the few places that I've seen give more than a few raviolis in those dishes wanna go back and try the lobster raviolis and if that plate is smaller than mushroom ravioli plate I'm gonna be pissed.  Also the kids plates are really good and the portions are pretty big.",

We managed to snag the last 3 seats at the bar at 5:45 which was lucky considering it was standing room only by 6:30. The service was definitely above average, quick and courteous even when they were swamped with all the event goers. I can't comment on the drink prices during happy hour because we were taking advantage of the free peach sangria and cucumber gin gimlets but the $2.95 tasting menu in the bar area is fabulous.   The Ravioli Caprese arrived with 3 generously sized pieces of ravioli in marinara sauce. Not only was this dish tasty, but for $3 I was impressed by the portion size. The Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. The portion is smaller than the ravioli but the flavor makes up for the size. So good, and only $3. We'll order two of those next time. The Margherita Flatbread was a little bland for my taste but between the other dishes and the bartenders plying us with free booze it's hard to complain.",

When asked about the house favorite he made several recommendations but then volunteered that the employee favorite, the Chicken Milanese but sub in the Vodka sauce for the red sauce.  James took great care of us all night and all his recommendations were great.  My Fiance had the employee special and I had the Shrimp/Lobster Fettuccine.  We started with the Cucumber Gimlet w/ Hendricks and Rasberry Mojito on the side of the Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip.  Couple glasses of red wine finished off the dinner.  Can see why spot is a local favorite.  Thanks James, we will be back again.",

We paid $38 for two glasses of wine.  We ordered the calamari appetizer.  When it arrived, there was only a few pieces of calamari with none of the rings or squid tentacles and it had deep fried pepperoncinis. My friend ordered the ribeye steak and had to send it back as it was overly salted and almost well done. I ordered the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. The pasta was slightly warm and the sauce was almost non-existent. The kitchen seems to have always put out the food too fast. We hadn't finished the calamari when the salad was served and then hadn't finished the salad when the entree was served. The food has definitely gone down hill, the prices have gone up and we won't be back.",

They gave us waters while we waited for HH.   We fit 8 people in the booth - pretty squished but we fit! As soon as 3:30 hit, our server came over to take our order. Each of us ordered 2 plates and some drinks. I got the Brio burger and the black pepper shrimp. I normally don't like burgers but I really like brio's burger! I think the bun is pretty heavy though so I usually take the top off. I think my favorite dish off of the HH menu though is the black pepper shrimp. It's sooooo good! It's like a curry dish with shrimp and eggplant! Order it. You definitely won't regret it. For drinks, I got the white peach sangria. I went to a different Brio and thought these were pretty strong but it wasn't as strong here.   The service here is also really good! They did, however, took a long time to bring one of my sister's burgers... and didn't bring it over until we were almost done with our meal. They also forgot to bring a flatbread but compensated with bringing a bigger flatbread. Lol",

We are at The Brio location in TownSquare and loved it. We decided to try this Brio since it was closer. We received the worst service, long wait and the waiter was giving us attitude when we would order or have a comment.   I ordered a spinach and artichoke for an appetizer and also a Salmon for dinner. My girlfriend ordered the Pasta Brio. The Spinach and Artichoke was overall good but the flatbread that it came with were stale and was not good at all. I told the waiter and he brought over a manager. The manger stated that that does not look like how they should be made. She gladly brought us a new spinach and artichoke dip and flatbread. The waiter spoke under his breath that I could not interpret but it was still rude nonetheless. The salmon was dry and tasted over cooked and the mashed potatoes that it came with were completely bland and dry. The pasta Brio's pasta was undercooked and hard.  Overall, we have been to Brio multiple times prior just at the TownSquare location on Las Vegas BLVD and were constant customers. The bad service we received and to end the night with really bad food ruined our Anniversary dinner and will not be coming to that location again. I am not the one to write reviews of every location but it was worth the need to share with the public of how this experience was.",

Some minuses still include odd servings if you get food to go or ask for your wedge salad chopped for you; your still only getting half the dish?! Table service is consistent; consistently slow.   I keep hoping for more. -----  Previous review:  Ordering to-go: Half the food you order in-house but the same price and they expect to be tipped. Tasty, sure. Predictable in a good way.

    "text": "I really don't get the high average of reviews here.  I think people are being blinded by the location. Sometimes a great ambience will make you feel the food tastes better than it does.  The ambience (decor and furniture) is top shelf.  BUT, the food here is really quite mediocre.  Just a step above a Sbarro's, with more flair.  I've received plates that were not to temperature (too cold), and inconsistently prepared (like the roasted, planked chicken I used to always go for, until I got the feeling that it just wasn't what it used to be.  The location at Town Square still does this dish fairly well).  The pasta is fairly good.  The salads are decent.  Other dishes are decent. The bread is quite good, and the only offering I've had so far that I don't feel I could make just as well, if not better, at home.  (When I go out to eat, I expect to partake of a meal that I could not do better at home!)  I think the menu is a bit too large, and they should do more rotation, and do more specials.  But this is not the reason for a 3-star review.  The real issue is the service.  The service is more miss than hit, in my experience here.  I have rarely felt that my server could care less about me and whomever I was eating with.  And because I work in the area (and professionals seem to gravitate to this place for lunch), I've had the experience of being here numerous times.  I've gotten out of it a few times, though, by suggesting other nearby spots!  (Like Vintner Grill).  I just have never felt especially welcomed or treated with warmth or enthusiasm here on any occasion whatsoever.  Even though I am quite a friendly person!  The girls up front are usually clueless, can't answer any questions about the menu, can't tell you if someone you're waiting for is there, make you feel as though you're bothering them if you sit and wait in the lounge chairs by the door for your party, wear the most ridiculously short skirts or dresses, or cleavage tops, and are snobby, and apparently catty.  Even the young guys give you \"I'm too sexy for this place\" vibes.  It's so not luxury.  And so at odds with the ambience of the environment.  I just don't GET why you would--out of all of the options at Tivoli Village (e.g., Echo & Rig)--pick this place.",

    "text": "This place is definitely a chain Italian restaurant and you can taste that. The meals are neither noteworthy or horrible. The last time I went I ordered the risotto with lobster because the waitress said it was one of the guests favorites. I don't know how you mess up something as delicious as lobster and risotto! First, the texture was runny. Second, the taste was just way off. I barely ate any of my $30 dish. We shared a salad beforehand and that wasn't bad. Our friends liked their dishes. I can't recall what they had. So it may just be a preference thing.",

    "text": "I was coming here since this place (finally) opened on my side of town.  The happy hour is just amazing.  It was $2.99 for like 8 different dishes, but I recently went back and was disappointed to find that happy hour dishes are now $3.99.  The bartender told me they have some newer items, and the portions are bigger.  I wouldn't know as I went for the burger, which did not change in size.  They also told me they added $5 cocktails, which also didn't matter to me as I was drinking a regular priced Stella, if I remember correctly.  I came back a few weeks later and had two apps, the beef carpaccio and the crispy shrimp.  I almost always get the carpaccio, so I was pretty excited when indeed a bigger plate arrived.  Except once I was digging in, I found that they had sliced the meat thinner than before, and so it seemed like the same amount... or LESS!  The meat kind of stuck to the plate, so it wasn't the same enjoyable appetizer that I was used to.  The crispy shrimp were a nice addition to the menu, though.  Tasty, plentiful, and not too much breading.  I definitely enjoyed that.  I also tried a $5 sangria rosa just so I could sample their drink menu, and it was good, but it didn't blow me away.  This is still one of the best happy hours on this side of town, but it's not the \"oh my god we have to go there\" deal that it once was.",

We ordered a Caesar salad to go because we know longer wanted to be there because of the horrible experience and they took an extra 20 minutes just to deliver us our order, we will not Be coming back to Brio at Tivoli Village and will not recommend it to anyone that we know, it's a shame, it was our favorite restaurant .",

We showed up a few minutes early checked in and we were told to take a seat. After watching the hostess seat 3 seperate groupd of walk-ins, and about 15 minutes later, a totally different hostess asked us if we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. I explained that we were not, we had a reservation. She looked embarassed and sat us immediately. As we walked in and saw several empty tables, I was not happy. Next, the bus person brought a basket of bread but no plates. After a few minutes I got up and grabbed 2 plates off of an empty table. Finally when our waiter, Julio, got the ball rolling it went smoother. We ordered a flatbread pizza for an app and the Pasta Brio for our main course. The Executive Chef took the time to personally bring us fresh warm bread and ask us about the food. Julio brought us out a complimentary piece of the marscapone cheesecake with a candle for my birthday. The excellent food made up for the piss-poor first impression. More training and oversight in those areas is much needed. They just were'nt that busy. That's why they get 4 stars.",

Usually we go to Leone, but today I wanted to try Brio because I was craving pasta.   The ravioli di bello was the perfect dish to satisfy that craving. I wish I had taken better note of what was in it, but basically it was cheesy mushroom ravioli with sauteed mushrooms and a chardonnay (it might have been some other wine) cream sauce. Yum yum yum yum yum. The flavors were developed very well, and it was indulgent without making me want to take a nap. Most of the items on the menu were within the $15-20 range, so you can have a meal with some friends and not break the bank.   Our waiter was a little pushy when it came to add-ons like appetizers and desserts but it really wasn't that big of a deal. I will definitely be coming back for more!",

    "text": "The Skinny: in general, below average Italian (2.5) service is very hit or miss (3) value: at $13-15 for an entree you could do much better elsewhere (2.5).  When we attended my Hubby's annual Christmas party, he had the unfortunate luck of winning a gift card for Brio Tuscan Grill. As soon as they called his name for the prize, my heart just sank into the bottomless pit of despair. Not to mention the hubs signed me up for their rewards program so I get a coupon now every year for my birthday.   WTF!?!?!? I swear, my hubs hates me. As if it isn't traumatic enough getting 1 year older.  I can't tell you the amount of vitriol I have for Brio Tuscan Grill but that would take way more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp sets out for reviews.  I mean, it's not that the food is absolutely disgusting. It isn't. It's all edible. But that's about it. Considering the exorbitant prices for the level of cuisine, this joint represents all the things that are repellent about dining in the Summerlin area: generic, pricey for what it is, and a hot spot for the geriatric crowd whose taste buds have been ruined by the multitude of meds they take. And don't forget the f*(king patio dining. Like I said, mediocrity at its finest.  If you must come, come for lunch as the prices are a lot better.  Okay, seeing as I have been forced to eat here more times that I care to, I'll let it loose on a few of the many items I have tried.  Lobster bisque ($6.95): too much sherry not enough lobster = pass.  Salads (including Caesar, Grilled Salmon salad) are pretty bad here. Have yet to ever have a salad here without finding some wilted lettuce mixed in. In addition to that, the dressings are all really generic. And what the heck is up with all the cheese they put on everything? What is up with all this gorgonzola? Pass.  Calamari ($10.45/lunch price): First of all, the plating. Have no idea who thought that putting the marinara and cream sauce (neither one which is particularly good), in the same bowl of the fried calamari. This makes all the fried food soggy. Not to mention the deep fried peperoncini represents half of the plate of greasy calamari.  Mezza Chicken under the Brick ($14.85/lunch): The roasted chicken is fine, the marsala sauce is decidedly meh. The plate is very small for the $14.85 price tag.   Pasta alla vodka ($16.15/lunch): My husband usually gets this. Me, I think it's okay. But given the price and the serving size, it's ridiculous. Pass on this one.  The only dish I have ever really truly liked there and thought that it was worth it was a special they had. It was a truffle oil flatbread with arugula, mushrooms and proscuitto. They had that for about $10.  Given that I would likely pass on nearly everything I tried there, I don't recommend coming here as for the above mentioned reasons. Though edible, their food is expensive for what it's worth. 2.5 starred review bumped down to 2 stars.",

    "text": "Three of us took Mom here for her birthday, to try something new, for lunch.  It's in the trendy Tivoli Square which looks brand new and is stylishly done.  The walls, decorations, art and overall feel screams Italian countryside, complemented by the bright Vegas sun outside.    We ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with the housemade chips, the mezzo chicken \"under the brick\", the grilled chicken risotto with sweet potatoes and I had the grilled shrimp with orzo.  Everything was good.  Nothing the blew us away.  The food is noticeably rich with butter and salt (fair warning for those looking for lighter, healthier choices) and is served in smallish portions perfect for lunch.  My family really enjoyed the housemade chips which were not salty at all and perfectly crisp.    This place might have gotten an extra star if the service had been a little bit more personable and organized.  The waitress was friendly but she came back after our order and handed me a Caesar salad.  I looked back at her in confusion.  \"I didn't order a salad.\"  \"Yes, you did.  This is yours.\"  My aunt spoke up and said it was hers and she apologized but if I told her I didn't order it, I thought that should have been it.    By the time we started eating, my mother still didn't have her side salad.  The waitress told us it would be right out.  After she'd brought it out, Mom said the girl dropped it on the table and said \"here you are\" while already looking to the next table and moving on.  Since she believes that service includes making eye contact with your customers when you are engaging with them, I'm mentioning it here.    Otherwise, it was a good experience.  It's reaosnably close to Summerlin, but I think we'll continue exploring other Italian options before returning.",

My only complaint, but it was a minor one due to a pet peeve of mine is that our server seemed a little aloof. Never around when I actually wanted him to be. Not sure where he was since the kitchen area is all open so you can you the server's stations, etc. I think we could have been out of their 10-15 minutes sooner had he been around. It wasn't just at the end of our meal, but also during. Seemed kind of weird for the type of establishment.

Waited about 10 min for anyone to come up to our table from the moment we sat down. Then they messed up on the appetizer salad and didn't come out till after our main entree. After we were done we waited even more. About 20 min or so till we got some service and that's because I had to go up to a manager to ask. And all this waiting we were watching our server walk past us many times without any acknowledgment that we were in his section. Never would I have thought I would have a horrible experience here. They did at least do the right thing and comp'd a bit off the bill. But free things aren't important. We were just looking for an apology and customer service. (Tivoli village location)",

A woman sitting next to me at the bar brandished her knife at me and threatened to hurt me and \"f*ck up my car\" and \"I'm not kidding.\"   Dressed ok, eating and she's threatening patrons.  I simply got up and  took my purse and said, \"why are you threatening me?\" and the manager asked us both to leave.  I had already had two martinis, and an appetizer.  There was no incident until her.  This may be Summerlin, but it's turned into Scummerlin. The staff can't handle anything.  This was just awful.",

Bartender was friendly enough to tell me the eggplant shrimp is the best thing they've got, so I take him up on it.  He was right, the eggplant shrimp was very, very good, and I don't even like shrimp that much. Ravioli was good too, I'd probably get it again. Burger had a charred taste to it I liked. The burger was pretty simple, but hey, it's $3.95.  For the drinks I believe they only have Sangrias, Martinis, wine, and Mojitos for $5. No beer as far as I could tell.  The bartenders seemed nice and knew the regulars by name, the ambiance is good, parking is easy in Tivoli Village, and the prices for happy hour are worth it. Nice spot for a slightly more \"upscale\" happy hour at cheap prices.",

For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.    Their happy hour must be one of the best!

    "text": "Very Disappointed!  I have been to Happy Hour at the Summerlin location a couple of times and enjoyed the appetizer menu and the prices. Thought it would be a nice place to take my friend for her birthday.  I made reservations the day before for the 2 of us. When I arrived (early)  I told the hostess that I was there and would let her know when my friend showed up. I told her it was my friend's birthday and asked it they did anything special. She said \"Oh yes!  She would post it on her reservation list.\"    When she seated us It was on time at 8:00PM on Wednesday night and the place was not the least bit crowded.  In fact it was very slow.  I asked her if I could see their brunch menu.  She said that it was just their regular menu. I have seen others post on here about their eggs benedict and other \"brunch\" items\".  hmmm. Maybe I just missed it on the regular menu. I wasn't planning on ordering anything from that menu, but wanted to consider it for a later occasion.  When the waiter came, he was very gracious. He asked if we wanted any appetizers before dinner. I told him that I would like the bruschetta. NEVER GOT IT! I also ordered the lobster bisque and it was excellent.   My friend ordered the 7 ounce steak and said that it was very good.  I ordered the \"Pasta Brio\".  I have had better at Applebees. Seriously!    I had also seen on this site that some had raved about their bread basket and how wonderful their rolls were..  We didn't get a bread basket. I had to ask another waiter for it. It arrived with just little slices of some kind of toast - No rolls.   My wine was a 4 ounce glass of Cabernet. $13. THIRTEN Dollars!!! It was decent, but certainly not worth $13.  Hey this is not a Strip destination spot.  It's an upscale locals restaurant (At least I thought so.)  I may come back for Happy Hour, but doubt if I eat dinner here again, Highly overpriced menu.    PS: Didn't have anything for a birthday - no dessert or anything.  This is the only review for a restaurant I have ever written.",

    "text": "I've been to the Happy Hour twice in one week!  This is a really great HH, but let me warn you, it's a girly HH.  Because as my husband said, \"There's nothing but martinis and mojitos on this damn drink list!\"  It's True, 95% of the menu is sugary and girly concoctions, but sometimes I like me a good lemon drop!  Opinions on the drinks: The drinks are nicely made and tasty and they're all only $5.  My favorite is one of the special ones they have on Wednesdays that is like a lemon drop with basil.  The sangria rosa is better than the white peach sangria.  The strawberry mojito tastes like fresh strawberries.  The red wine is a good, dry one.  Opinions on the food: This is the money maker right here.  During HH, they have a special food list where everything is $3.95.  My husband and I ordered a hamburger to share.  Wowza, when it came out, it was like the size of a Carl's Jr. burger and it came with homemade potato chips.  What, what, what?  This whole thing is only $4?  And it was a delicious hamburger with melted provolone cheese and a zingy little secret sauce.  The gentleman next to us ordered the spicy crispy shrimp and a sausage flatbread, both of which were also generously sized for the $4 pricetag.  When I went with my friend, we ordered the ravioli caprese.  Very tasty, but it only comes with 3 ravioli.  Come on...you give out a huge burger and chips, but only 3 ravioli?  I was a little disappointed in that.  We also ordered the shrimp and eggplant which has a really nice smoky sauce to it.  It does get crowded during the HH, and sometimes you have to wait a while to get the bartender's attention, but that is what you have to expect when it's a great HH.  My advice: get there around 3:30 so you can find a seat and put an order in before the rush!",

They raised the appetizer prices to 3.95... but seriously, it's worth it. 3.95 is still a steal especially for this girl!   Not much of a bar area compared to their other location at town square. It's also quite busy so if you don't go there early, you may not get a seat.   Appetizers we ordered: 1) Brio burger: Cut into 4. Simple burger.. but really well done. A fluffy bread with a juicy patty.  2) Ravioli Caprese: 5 pieces of breaded cheese ravioli. Fried to perfection.  3) Beef Carpaccio: MY FAVORITE DISH. Thinly sliced salty meat. What more could you ask for? 4) Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant: Another delicious dish. 5) Crispy Shrimp Piccante: Boyfriend l  It was more than enough for the both of us but we seriously wanted to try everything.  The drinks are delicious. Just martinis mostly. No beer. But well, it's all good. Cause I have my 3.95 appetizers.",

We requested the burger to not be over cooked and it was good like we asked, however our server seemed annoyed when we asked him to let kitchen know not to over cook it.

I sampled the Tuscan Stuffed Peppers, the Bruschetta and the Calamari.  The stuffed peppers were the best with a nice mix of sausage and creamy cheese filling.  Calamari was decent, cooked properly, but not outstanding.  The bruschetta was our least favorite - the bread was very dry, without enough moisture from the toppings to soften it.  This resulted in the entire piece crumbling after the first bite. Our service was fine.",

It cut through like butter, the flavor was amazing, and I gobbled it down.  The portions are really small at Brio.  I was expecting my plate to be a bit more loaded for the price I pay compared to hole in the wall Italian restaurants found in Las Vegas.

I had experienced below average service here in the past, but nothing egregious. Knowing this, I had mentally prepared myself for the culinary adventure I was about to undertake... I sat down with a friend at one of the round tables in the bar area. I noticed the same waitress who had been my waitress the other times I had entered the establishment, the very same one who had given shotty service in the past. She was very busy talking to a woman seated at the bar, they appeared to be friends (I made eye contact with her about five times as I waited). I noticed the bar tender as I sat, Making eye contact with this gentleman multiple times. I sat for about 5 minutes, my excitement disappearing by the minute. Again, I made eye contact with the bartender. He went over to the waitress who was still talking to her friend and asked \"are you going to take care of them?\" being busy, she retorted \"that's your job, my tables are all taken care of\". They are arguing loudly, so the patrons in the bar could hear every word, for about 3 minutes. My friend was so embarrassed. Finally, the waitress came over and handed us menus, asked if we wanted waters, and would be back to take our order. We left the establishment. We went across the street to Made LV, and vented to the bartender there about this treatment. He laughed and said he heard it all the time. I wrote an email to the Brio corporate office relating this experience. A couple of days later, brio called, but I missed the call. I called back and spoke to the hostess, who took a message for the manager that I had called back. I received a call from the manager the next day, who apologized and was very sweet,  but also informed me that HER manager wanted to talk to me and apologize. It's been 2 and a half weeks and am still waiting for a call. By the way, first yelp review.   -Russ",

Service was professional and friendly -most in our party were happy with dinner - just wasn't my day, I guess?  :-( .  Restaurant and restrooms were noticeably... well, could be cleaner?  Meals were small in portion, wine was way over-priced for the offering or am I spoiled by COSTCO?  ha, ha.  Fry cook for a chef?  Don't order the Salmon.  I've been very please in several visits in the past... don't know if there was a change in managers or the kitchen might just be having a bad day?  I'll try em again - and might pick up the tab next time :-) Thank you Bob, for dinner - the company was awesome!",

In the past, lasagna day was half off their lasagna dish. I called a week ahead to see if this was still True and made reservations when the person on the phone said it was. One week later, we get there and sit down and order. The waiter didn't know about this at all, or what the special was. Before he took our orders, the salads that came with the lasagna were included. And yet after we got the check and I asked about the discount, he said the manager said that the salads were what were given for free.   Unless they come out with better and more clear announcements so that everyone is on board, not four different people thinking different things, I'll have to cancel the lasagna anniversary. =(",

Happily not much of wait at all most part soon walked in got seated. They had live band playing outside that night outside on the patio. So the place had nice lively vibe too it especially around the patio/bar area. So I do need too come back because like the whole outdoor, open fire pit, and HH prices looks like steal.   I came in for dinner with the family. We ordered two appetizers too share start artichoke spinach dip and calamari. Both really good. I enjoyed about the artichoke spinach dip was the fact it came with lavosh crackers rather then typical beard. It gave the dish another spin with the crispy lavosh topped with nice hot dip on top! It was nice creamy texture, vibrant green color, and great flavor. The calamari was solid nice crispy moist hot on in the inside comes with two different sauce one traditional marinade sauce and other not sure. Each sauce paired nice with the crispy calamari. Both were great starter before our entrees.  I had the chicken milanese. Break it down same as chicken parmesan. The chicken breast had perfect golden crust on the outside nice crispy and cooked perfectly on the inside! It was nice HOT and moist throughout! It served on bed of noodles cooked perfectly and saute with in some kind of butter sauce. Outside around the bed of pasta had red sauce. I really enjoyed everything on the plate nothing left too show!  The atmosphere feel like upscale version of Olive Garden. The prices are not that really upscale might be slightly more expensive then Olive Garden. It great alternative if looking for Italian food. The staff there from time walked in too our server all greeted us with smile, warm welcome, and fabulous job! If in the near the area would stop by again.",

    "text": "Ahh, Brio. The finer side of dining. It is one of my favorite place to eat pasta and salad. But not at this location. Town Square is much better, and nicer too!   Ambiance: 3 - I mean, since you have the huge one at Town Square to compare it to, with TS's nice, high ceilings and romantic lighting..this location would be average. Tivoli seems like it caters more to families than the couples, adults, and tourists that crowd Town Square, sipping on wine and fancily buttering their bread.   Service: 4 - Our server was extremely funny and had a great personality. If there's one thing about Summerlin..they know customer service.   Food: 3 - First thing that has to get out: Food is a bit too pricey for what it is. I mean $15 dollars for a steak salad?! Come on now haha!   I do admit that I am really into salads lately, and Brio's sliced steak salad is one of my favorite combinations of meat and greens. But I do remember thinking that it was wayyy better at TS.   It was the meat that was -just slightly- better in quality at the other location. JUST slightly. It just tasted better at TS.   Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It was average. Brio Tivoli is still a fair place to eat. But if there was a race... Brio Town Square would win.",

The place was very busy & had a few new servers; thus, we waited too long for our water & drinks.  In fact, the couple next to us received their drinks before us.  So, while my partner went to inquire, the food arrived (shortly after my wine)...   beef carpaccio, cheeseburger & the mozzarella salad.  He returned to the table with Chef Mike who profusely apologized & proceeded to take care of us with the old favorite eggplant shrimp.  If you've not tried that, do treat yourself !  The special surprise was birthday TIRAMISU which we gobbled down in 3 minutes because it was sooooo good!  And all the other food was equally as delicious.  I love the addition of that mozzarella salad which is substantial and, unlike 90% of the other happy hours in town, is a healthy menu item.  Our new server, Ashley, is from Oregon & a wonderful new staff member.  Chef Mike is from upstate New York & loves fishing, which subject will quickly engage him.  We've been frequenting Brio's since its opening and all these years have rarely, only rarely been disappointed.  With this little glitch, how can we complain?",

Got the spicy chicken bacon sandwich. BEWARE it tastes like chipotle sauce and mayonnaise only! It was the most awkward tasting item is ever had before! French toast was underwhelming as well. Very tart with some gross lemon filling. But the fruit and syrup were delicious. Which we had to ask for syrup from three different people. Bc we were still hungry we ordered a side of scrambled eggs... Which took twenty minutes to arrive. Then I had to go to the bar for ketchup. It was just an overall poor experience. We wanted to love this place. The patio is very nice to enjoy! We had a great time people watching!",

I wish I could remember our server's name because she made the night (white, dark blonde hair pulled back, funny)!   The food was great. 2 of us got the gargonzola crusted beef medallions. YUM! One got tortellini and one got the gargonzola crusted lamb chops. We also had calamari and caesar salads for appetizers. All food was great. We had cocktails and then got a bottle of wine. The wine selection never disappoints. Toward the end of dinner, they brought out creme brulee with a candle for the bday boy which was nice. The table ordered dessert drinks (I had an amazing port wine!).   So why only 3 stars? We loved the service and the food. The problem was the fire alarm. It went off not once but twice during dinner. So loud thay everyone was plugging their ears. Strobe lights flashing. It took a very long time for it to stop each time. I understand that this might be out of the restaurants control, but they could have done something to appease the few tables of people in the restaurant. After the first alarm, a manager walked around apologizing. After the second, nothing. There weren't many people in the restaurant at 9:30 so it would have been a nice gesture to at least offer a drink on the house or something. No more apologies or compensation. It just seems a little unprofessional when we're spending $300 and had to sit through alarms twice.   If you can go and avoid the alarm (or don't mind them not caring if it ruins your dinner), everything else is great!",

    "text": "Tonight I visited Brio (Trivoli Village location) with a large group (about 25 people). They set us aside in a semi-private area and assigned us two dedicated waiters. If you take anything else away from this review, it should be that those waiters were exceptional. Really more than exceptional!!! As far as I am aware, they didn't mess up a single thing for the entire group, they were patient and attentive, my water glass was always full, I always had a drink in front of me, plates were cleared promptly and on top of it all they were friendly and engaged. And it should be noted that we were ordering off the menu, not working with a pre-fixed menu even though we had a large group.   The ambiance of the restaurant is great and they had a nice little patio (which we couldn't take advantage of since it was raining), everything was clean and not overly crowded feeling.  Now for the food. All of our food, including a full arrangements of appetizers ordered for the party, arrived to our tables timely and piping hot. The presentation was beautiful. Their drinks (especially the Italian Mule) were amazing. However, the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that, for me, the food was average. I tried the tomato caprese, Margherita flatbread, the roasted garlic, spinach and artichoke dip, the sorrento chicken soup and fettuccini Alfredo.  With our group, we tried every appetizer on the menu and a good selection of dishes and desserts. All of their food was ok, the flavors were all a little too heavy, or the seasoning was a little off, or not quite as crisp was I would like. This being said, pretty much everyone else in the group was raving about how much they liked their food so this might come down to personal preferences but for me their food was average.   That being said, I'd probably eat their again if for no other reason than their excellent service.",

I would give 3.5 if it was an option.   The interior is very similar to all the other Brio's in town. The patio is a little nicer than the town sq location. The bar area is a decent size and has comfortable booths. The food is consistent as well as the service, which is a huge plus... however, there isn't anything overly special about either. They did accommodate my love for vegetables for an added cost which was a plus, but they were bland and i had to ask for more seasoning. It's Italian food, very Americanized and very commercial. I've attended the brunch on Sunday as well and they did have avocado toast which was delicious. Will i return? Yes. They have pretty decent happy hour which is always great with friends or for a quick bite before a movie with my guy.",

Yes!  My friend ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone (middle picture) with capers, lemon, roasted vegetables, and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. Lovely!  Another friend ordered the Shrimp Mediterranean (top photo). Spicy, grilled shrimps served with orzo, farro, broccoli, asparagus, tomatoes, spinach, Feta, and drizzled with pesto vinaigrette. Mouth-watering!  I recommend this lovely eat-to-your-heart's-content restaurant in lovely Tivoli Village. Bring your visiting friends & family. They will enjoy it as much as you!",

After I had 2 of the best sangrias in town I joking asked for some bactine for a burn I had on my shoulder from a curling iron and he went out of his way to get me some first aid ointment in the back room. Such a caring person! Seriously this shows so much of his inner character and compassion not just for his job but for people in general!",

We had one of the best meals that I've had so far in Vegas here.  They are locals and have been coming here for years and said its a great spot, now I agree.  While the service was only ok, the food was delicious.  Being that I was with guests, I didn't take pictures of my food which was a little sad for me.  We ordered the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer and for mains we ordered the chicken lemone, lasagna and pan seared salmon.  I love eggplant and that appetizer was so good.  It was extremely rich with a cream sauce but it was so flavorful.  I had a bite of my friends lasagna which was great and I had the chicken lemone and ate the whole thing.  I rarely like chicken from anywhere but this was so good.  Any chance that I get I will just come back to get that dish again.  I would try other things on the menu but I've been to one of these before.  For some reason though, this location does a really good job with the food compared to others.",

The Italian Wedding Soup is some of the best I've ever had (seems to be served most Saturdays) - it's what draws me here. My PIC says the lobster bisque is just as good. The calamari is delicious, and is compete with banana peppers!! Finally, Vegas!! The bruchetta and flatbreads are also delicious; my favorite is the sundried tomato or the margarita. My only complaint: the wedding soup is a soup de jour, but should totally be available everyday.",

Everything changed, no more hamburger as well as other items like flat bread pizza removed & I asked for the hamburger off the regular menu (willingly ready to pay more) but removed totally. Asked what's happening & told new management. Well I I assume that had a problem making money & they figured removing items from the menu was the answer. WRONG because they just lost me as a customer. Maybe they need to look elsewhere for there sales or profit issues as removing favorite items of customers from the menu is not the way. Seems happy hour is not working out for them so making changes is one way to turn it into unhappy hour. Just charge more if u need, we can afford it as that's better than chasing us away, or why don't u stop doing happy hour if it's not working for your bottom line.",

It has all the same menu items affordable drink options and a happy hour menu. However I always love the environment. It's very bright and colorful and has a Tuscan feel to it. By the way, if you go for happy hour, make sure you get there a little bit before because they only serve it at the bar and people can be a little bit nasty and territorial about saving spots for other people. But that's not the restaurants fault :-)",

It needed more garlic and salt but otherwise, very tasty. Our server Jonathan, was excellent. It very pretty inside.

Well, as all the recent reviews note, this is not a change for the better.  The one thing that needed changing is the slow service, and it did not change at all.    What did NOT need changing was the menu but oh, have they ever gotten to work on that.  Gone is any lunch menu - replaced by a single menu that appears to be dinner pricing and all a la carte.  But are these the dinner portions?  Our server said they only have one menu now, but all our dishes were pretty small.  There are no sandwiches anymore, which was one of highlights of this place in the past.  I have to say, Brio no longer provides good value and in a town so full of restaurants I think this approach can't possibly work.  I know I won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "WTH BRIO you broke my heart.  I have visited brio in town square numerous times. but the Brio on Rampart is so much closer to my home. I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide.. 2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread.  3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is.  4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed.   the food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.  the worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.  I'll never come back to this Brio again.",

They forgot one of the apps, so we had to ask the waitress.  We also had to ask her repeatedly for refills.  Other than the waitress and staff who need a  bit more training in customer service, we thought the food was very good (vegs and hummus, spinach/artichoke dip, shrimp, caprese salad).  There are pita chips with everything, I'd like to see them offer something that's gluten free.  Overall, a good experience.",

Although the restaurant was quite empty we were seated in the bar area with high bar stools and little round tables that barely sat 4 (some of our tabled had to squeeze 5).  There were only 2 servers.  One took the orders and the other delivered.  Unlike any other bar/restaurants we've gone to when it came time to get the bills we were told that we couldn't get individual bills.  We would get one bill for each table and it was up to us to figure out who owed what including each share of the tax.  After speaking to the manager, although she was very nice and smiley it still came down to; that's the way it is.  If you're a group of more than 4 don't go to Brio's happy hour.",

They even had a nice pre printed menu for the day. It's a pretty restaurant with nice atmosphere, but a real let down for special brunch.",

The cheesecake alone rivals the best with its cracked sugar crust, creme anglaise and peach melba (sweet raspberry) sauce drizzled all over its decadent behind.  Aww such bliss exists truly in a well prepared dinner!  The staff is also attentive and aware when you want to have a quiet moment or a full on party....",

There was nothing particularly wrong with our experience, but it wasnt mind blowing either. The service was adequate and we enjoyed dining outside. The bread given as a starter was good and my wifes Caesar salad was tasty. I ordered the seafood pasta and three of my clams were not opened, they could recognise this before sending it out. My pasta had way too much sauce and the fish was almost invisible. One of the meals came out with the wrong noodles but they apologised immediately and made a new one quickly without fuss which was great. It feels like Brio is trying to be upscale but cutting costs on the food. There are several Italian restaurants in town where the food is spectacular and while Brio is decent, it doesnt meet the level of some of these other places.",

I was also surprised at how \"inexpensive\" it was - $17.50 a plate is less than mahi mahi plates at places of similar caliber (i.e., McCormick's and Salt Creek).

It's very good and comes with 2 types of sauce.  The Caesar salad is also great!  For main courses I suggest the steak salad or the Gorgonzola steak medallions. I've tried other things on the menu and always come back to those two!  The lava cake is also pretty good!   The service is consistently good as well!

I got a chicken and angel hair pasta dish- I'm kinda a snub when it comes to pasta, but there was nothing to complain about! My boyfriend got the crab cakes- the veggies were pretty salty but the cakes great! We got mini cheesecakes to go we didn't want the staff to have to wait on us past closing: not really fair.

Hey I had to make sure it wasn't poisoned right!? ;)  Us moms decided upon something light and refreshing since everything on the menu looked heavy. Soup and salad it was. The salad was just okay, the dressing was good. Some type of vinaigrette. It was chopped into tiny pieces with feta cheese, tomatoes, black olives, cucumber an romaine lettuce. Very large. Then the soup was lobersterlicious!! Aka, lobster bisque. Oh my god, I cannot stop raving about it. Creamy, buttery, lobster goodness. It was rich, and delicious. Large portion again. I downed that sucker almost licking the bowl. I will come just for that, for sure!!",

    "text": "I came here for the first time for Easter lunch with family.  I understand that it was a crowded and hectic day that may account for the lackluster food, but, still, I think the food should hold up, regardless.  One of us had the brunch item of French Toast; another had a club sandwich; I had the salmon salad.  The food overall was just mediocre.  Good enough, but we won't be back.  My salmon in the salad was quite delicious and cooked perfectly, but the bed of greens was not high quality and the tomatoes were cut into tiny, tiny little pieces -- obviously to use in all the other dishes but weird for a salad.  The grilled asparagus in the salad was withered and too tough to eat except for the very tips. I couldn't even cut the stems with my knife.  The 'shoestring' potatoes were a nice touch, but not too many of these. I chose to omit the feta cheese, so that was the extent of this salad -- good salmon, poor greens, tiny bits of tomato, tough asparagus, and good but sparse shoestring potatoes.   Beyond the food, the place was really too loud to have a good conversation -- it was crowded, of course.  The decor was outdated.  Service was cordial but slow, but I attributed it to the busy day.  I see others have commented on slow service, so it may not have been due to the Easter Sunday crush, but I won't be coming back to find out.  Too many good restaurants in Las Vegas for me to come back here.",

    "text": "Brio is definitely a house favorite for my family and I. We're definitely a regular for multiple reasons!   From the lovely ladies who greeted us to the front to the gentleman that continued to monitor our table to make sure our drinks were refilled as well as our bread basket. Our server was and always is very friendly and needless to say patient. We're pretty indecisive mainly because every dish is so great. I usually don't step out my comfort zone and try new things but here I have no issue picking something new! Yes, I'm that annoying customer who will ask the server what their favorite dish is. I wanted something spicy so I got a pasta dish and as I write this review I've forgotten the name. The point is though you can't go wrong with whatever you choose.   One thing I will recommend to fellow yelpers is you have to, HAVE TO try their Spicy Eggplant and Shrimp. Don't let the eggplant part scare you off. I know it's not everyone's first choice but you can't go wrong with this dish. It contains pan seared shrimp, Romano crusted eggplant and the best part the black pepper cream sauce. It'll immediately turn into one of your favorites.   Also, this location had a great happy hour with live music on the patio! It seemed like everyone was enjoying their time while we choose to sit in dinning area.   Great service, great dishes and a nice atmosphere; WINNING.",

After about ten minutes of waiting, we decided to just leave and have brunch elsewhere. We were excited to try a new place for brunch, but didn't get the opportunity and we won't be back.

We decided to try it out for lunch. I ordered the pasta carbonara. Even the waiter was like, \"Oh that's a really good choice!\" with enthusiasm when I ordered. Great, I thought, I'm getting excited. When it came, honestly, it seemed like it was reheated leftovers. The outside was cold and dry while the inside was piping hot (almost like as if it was out of the microwave). The sauce was not saucy, it was dry and not at all creamy that you would expect from a carbonara. Extremely disappointing. I would rather spend $5-$10 less at a competitor restaurant that has way better quality of food.   My husband ordered a salad and shrimp pasta. They didn't have the house salad made at 12:45pm for some reason? He had to substitute for a chopped salad. That plus the shrimp pasta were mediocre at best, and unimpressive, especially for the cost.   The service was great and the only reason for the second star to be honest.   Needless to say, we'll definitely never be back.",

The other guests have done and left, our food was nowhere near being served. We honestly thought we were forgotten. Other times, the service was spot on.   Just don't come here when you're hungry since the service can be hit and miss. We've made that a point now before deciding to pick Brio for a meal out.

Edgar never checked in on us to make sure we needed anything else, which, we did. He didn't seem warm or friendly or seemed like he liked his job. I gave 2 stars because the lobster bisque and salads we all got which were delicious, otherwise a bad service experience would've been a 1.

The restaurant it self was clean and inviting.   The food was tasty and served hot, every dish looked delicious.   Everyone in our party was very happy with their selection.  Only one draw back, what Italian restaurant doesn't serve meatballs.  They offer a list of pasta dishes, an no meatballs, not even offered as a side dish.  The waiter offered a meat sauce,  instead.   The meat sauce was good, had I wanted meat sauce.  That's the main part of any good Italian dinner.  The meatballs make or break the cook.",

    "text": "Happy hour review only.  Brio Tuscan Grille's first location in town is at Town Square, and that outpost is far more accessible to me normally. However, some friends and I had just wrapped up our first stop of a happy hour crawl at another Tivoli Village destination, so I was more than happy to take a short walk over here.  Happy hour here is Mon-Fri 3:30-6:30pm, and we were able to find one of those U-shaped booths in the bar area to enjoy a comfortable meal. I was disappointed to learn that they have only three beer options ($5 each), and I didn't feel like trying any of what they had on hand or partaking in the other drink options ($5 martinis on Wednesday, $5 wine glasses with expanded selection on Thursdays, $5-6 cocktails), aside from fun and surprisingly coconutty sip of my friend's Cosmopolitan.  However, the food menu ($4-6) was more than enough to keep me entertained. I was pleasantly surprised that there are more options than at sister restaurant Bravo Cucina Italiana, which is located near me in Henderson but never truly impressed me for some reason. I enjoyed pretty much everything which we shared at our table.  Margherita Flatbread ($4): very crispy, cracker-thin flatbread with fresh, traditional toppings. Fun, but not very filling.  Buffalo Chicken \"Nachos\" ($5): potato chips cut not-so-thinly with a surprisingly amazing supporting cast of sauces, cheeses, and of course Buffalo chicken (mildly spicy at best) made this the one that I'd pick as my favorite out of the meal. I didn't even order it, but I'll strongly consider doing so next time.  Warm Margherita Dip ($5): a very creamy cheese blend with delicious tomato compote on top and crispy, charred ciabatta to play vehicle. Another to add to my reorder list.  Beef Carpaccio ($5): plentiful plate of thinly-sliced beef with mustard aioli, a mix of greens including arugula (my fave), and capers. Parmesan cracker to boot, although it's a bit awkward to break for sharing.  Black Pepper Shrimp ($6): shocker of the menu simply due to huge potion. Amply sized shrimp atop squares of crispy eggplant, all in a black pepper cream sauce. Would've been my fave if it had been just a touch less salty.  I'll definitely have to find an excuse to visit the other local Brio now that I'm aware of what I've been missing out on, but this one is a good alternative if you're anywhere in the vicinity and would be happy not to wait at all to find an open seat for happy hour.",

    "text": "(Happy Hour Review)  Recently came here for Happy Hour after a day of shopping for some new furniture, last one being nearby at Living Spaces in Boca Park, across the street.   Conveniently located in Tivoli Village, in one of the \"corners\" of the round about, directly across from Echo & Rig. This location doesn't seem as big as the Town Square location.   Since we were there for Happy Hour, you just walk to the bar area and sit down at any open area. There was a small table open between two parties so we sat there.   Beef Carpaccio - Shaved tender beef, field greens, capers, mustard aioli, Parmigiano Reggiano, Parmesan flatbread  Regular item i've always gotten during Happy Hour. Simple carpaccio brightened up with capers and aioli.   Margherita Flatbread - Vine-ripened tomatoes, Mozzarella, basil  Originally my mom wanted to get the caprese salad for the mozzarella but i told her we had the same mozzarella at home. Got this instead. Really thin, crispy flatbread with paper thin slices of tomatoes and basil. Mozzarella was kind of missing. XD maybe that was paper thin as well and melted away... Mildly plain tasting though the thin, crispy flatbread was yummy.   Potato Skins - Applewood bacon, Cheddar cheese sauce, green onion, lime crema   Surprisingly, i liked this one the most. Fingerling sized potatoes baked/fried/whatever'ed to point with some crisp edges, crispy bacon, and fresh green onions. Ask for a extra side of the sauce ! (this was the waiters suggestion) Though it tastes like sour cream, but makes sense if it was a lime cream. Lol   White Peach Sangria - Chardonnay, Peach Schnapps, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits  Light tasting sangria. refreshing though on a hot day.   I had some pineapple drink with pineapple soaked vodka, and some other stuff which tasted like pineapple juice. That was pretty good too except i think they put too much ice, so mine disappeared pretty fast.   Overall, can't complain about the happy hour. Served it's purpose of giving alcohol and snacks for a cheap price ! Ha ! this was my super early dinner because i had to sleep early *snore*",

I finished my meetings for the day and am from out of town so I did a little \"Yelp\" research for a good happy hour place.  The reviews were pretty good so I trusted the reviews and went for it.  The hours of happy hour are 3:30-6:30pm M-F.  I had two good glasses of cabernet for $5 each and an amazing beef carpaccio plate for $5.  This was basically free in my book.  Anyhow, the wine was superb and the beef carpaccio was delicious.  Besides the price, the product was way better than what I expected.   As Arnold said, \"I will be back\"!  Give it a try.  Be sure to ask for Jen!",

The guy there looked at us like we were an inconvenience, no smile, no greeting. We told him we were there for the happy hour. He told us to find a place at the bar, it was open seating.   We found a spot, really uncomfortable high tops. They have a few booths which were taken. My friend ordered their tropical Cosmo which tasted like syrup, had barely any alcohol. I ordered Pinot Grigio which was good. They have $5 wine specials on Thursday.  We tried the margarita dip, margarita flat bread and crispy shrimp brio. Our server messed up the order and got us potatoes instead of shrimp. I would give 5 star to the margarita dip, was probably the only thing I would remember from this visit that was good. Service was terrible, I would give zero, no one seemed to care about customers, our server was terrible, he never refilled any drinks or checked on us. We had to hunt him down for everything.   Definitely not worth coming back!",

We were seated and it took 20-25 minutes before our waiter came to our table and another 10 minutes to get our beverage!  It was the busser that was AWESOME and brought us straws and lemons   !  Also, the food runner took back my angel hair pasta which was bland no EVEOO or FRESH PARM!  and 2nd time sous chef got it perfect!  At this point our waiter failed US.  We still tipped him & honestly we should have requested the tip go to the busser and food runner!  The Bisteca was PERFECT",

Though happy hour is limited to the bar area and outdoor couches, Brian the manager was kind enough to let us enjoy happy hour at the tables on the patio since the place was so packed. I wish I could remember the name of our server because she was excellent! The bartenders, Alan and Ashley make excellent drinks and always have a smile on their faces. Living in Vegas I've gotten used to the ubiquitous bratty restaurant managers, servers and bartenders who act like you owe them something - they should take a lesson from the staff at Brio Tivoli Village - they are amazing and I can't wait to go back!",

It was setup very nicely, although I prefer the look and setup in Town Square (Thats just personal preference). The food was delicious as always and the staff was there to service, very friendly!   The staff did seem a little \"on edge\" and checking everything, but that is okay by me! I also think they were like that because it opened very recently, so they are still getting into the routine. Regardless, simply wonderful! I am sure with time this location will be just as popular as the Town Square location.",

I dined at a Brio at a different location, but it had been a few years. We had to wait for a few minutes, but that's expected on a Saturday night. Once we were seated, our server took our drink order and then our food order. The wait wasn't very long and the food was delicious. I had the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. My partner had the lasagne. My meal was absolutely scrumptious. I was hesitant about ordering it, but my server guaranteed me that I would enjoy it. He was right. I tasted the lasagna and it was cheesy and tasty. There was nothing special about the service. It was average. The restaurant was a little louder than I. Ike, but once my meal arrived, I easily forgot about that. I'll definitely go back more often.",

It is probably the longest standing restaurant in Tivola as many others have gone out of business or relocated since Tivoli opened (Petra, Radio City Pizza, etc).  The ambience inside is comfortable.  The service was attentive and helpful.  The food was okay, but could have wowed a bit more.  I had the lamb chops which were inconsistently cooked (some rare, some over), but the flavor was good.  My partner had the beef medallions with asparagus coating.  These were also pretty good, but nothing I would return for.  Overall, I think Brio was a good one time experience for me, but maybe I will try out their happy hour after reading some of the other reviews.",

Picking a place to eat from out of town is a little scary.  We were more than pleased.   They did an amazing job at securing our group in the back with a semi private area yet still part of the restaurant.  50 people sat comfortable.  We had our own table for two in the middle of our  group.  The tables were beautiful.  Everyone raved about the food and choices offered on our preset menus.  We had our own 3 servers and they did a spectacular job.  Thank you for completing our wedding day.",

I sat at the bar this time and Terri was the bartender. If you ever have the chance to interact with her consider yourself lucky. She is so full of energy, fun, and attentive. She became very busy the day I was there but she always checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted. She's funny and all around a good genuine person. Every server that passed by me always asked how I was doing and how my food was. Jessie one of the managers is the cherry on top of amazing service. He is always cool calm and collected and I see him running around with the servers helping them out. He's a genuine guy who cares about the way his restaurant is ran. If you're looking for good food and GREAT service this is the place to be!!!",

Then we busted the bar, and all the bar tenders were friendly. Over all this restaurant is worth the visit. Make reservations if your going on a Saturday.",

It was good, and it was wonderful to not have to worry about being glutened. The waiter was attentive. I like the atmopshere, it was warm enough to be seated out doors.  The only downside is the car entrance to Tivoli being out front, although there was a minimum of distraction from the cars. I will go again.",

    "text": "I have heard good things about Brio, and when my friend asked me to go with her, I was like \"sure, why not? Maybe this will be my new place to go\". but it's not...  When we walked in, I thought the decoration made the place feel so empty, maybe we went at a slow time? But I don't like the decoration at all. The waiter that served us, according to my friend, was a bit annoying. I thought he was okay, definitely not great though.  We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer, I thought that one wasn't bad at all, I actually liked it. My friend and I shared a pasta (I don't remember the name), and I thought it was alright, it wasn't appealing. For dessert, we had creme brulee and tiramisu. The creme brulee was good, unlike most people, I like the filling more than the caramel part, and their creme brulee has more filling than other places, so I was very pleased. On the other hand, the tiramisu wasn't that great, there was a strong rum taste in it. Maybe it's just me, I don't like that having too much rum in the tiramisu, so it was bad to me.  Overall, this place is only a one time thing for me, I don't think I'll go back unless I want to give this place another try.",

The staff is very prompt and friendly.  The food is delicious! My taste buds have never been let down! There are a few things I would change if I could,the volume of the place is always a little loud for my liking for a sit down restaurant,,it's so open and loud it's impossible to be an intimate dining experience.  But  other then that,it's a great place to get some amazing eats! The quatro bruschetta is devine!",

We had several rounds of appetizers (definitely try the shrimp and eggplant dish, the flat bread was popular with the guys).  Everyone appeared very happy with their drink drink selection. Service was good and the bar was very busy. No wonder!  Good job Brio! When will you be in La Jolla, CA?",

(they were busy) I hadn't tried this part of the the menu before and wasn't excited about it but the omlet was just fine. I usually eat the crab cakes at the location at Town Cener. But, the service there has gone downhill. It's like McDonalds Ronalds playland when you sit outside there. It sucks. You try and have a great meal and surrounding you is kids crying and running. Yes, I said running, around you. Nobody seems to notice ? I told the server I wouldn't be back since that was the 2nd dinner I had that experience. Apparently is not just a family restaurant,it's kiddie land....So, stick to the location on Rampart, so far, they haven't gone downhill...",

WIth this being the first day to really feel like summer (well, summer in Ohio, where I'm from) I really enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying the sunshine, the breeze and the passers by (including Carrot Top, who said hi as he ambled by). The atmosphere was fun and casual- I really liked the view of the outdoor section where diners sit separated from the sidewalks of Tivoli Village by an attractively scalloped, metal \"fence.\"  Aluminum-colored heating elements spaced throughout the outdoor area looked sculptural and artsy.  Large umbrellas protected patrons from the bright, hot sun.  Our waiter, Brian, had a great personality and made the experience even more enjoyable..  I had the risotto with chicken and the tossed salad for about $14.00. It was tasty, but I liked my friend's shrimp version better.  The crusty bread served before the meal was quite enjoyable.  A couple of us had the wedge salad, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola and garlic dressing that, in my opinion, was light and not overpowering. My friends loved that it had bacon.  I would definitely come here again and bring family or friends. Now I want to see what it looks like inside!",

    "text": "The staff: Somebody's always smiling, so that's a good sign.  They're cordial and they know their menu.  Most of the servers I've had there have been very friendly, got the time to know us and chat it up a bit.  Sometimes we come when it's busy and we don't see our server much; which is fine, I don't like when people hover anyway, but it would help if we didn't have to wait for them to walk by so we could ask for something.  The goods: Incredible happy hour.  The Brio Burger is probably my favorite thing to get but I've tried just about everything on the HH menu and I can't remember disliking anything.  The basic menu can get a little pricy.  I ordered a salmon salad something or other once, $14.95.  I won't say it wasn't worth the money because, oh my God it WAS.  But, I'm just saying, pricy (at least for me).  I love their dessert display.  We do something similar at the fine dining restaurant I used to work at.  They bring the plate over so you can look at your desserts.  Very good eye-catcher.  I always order the chocolate cake thingy (I should really learn the names...but whenever I order I sort of just point and say, \"I want THAT.  Please and thank you.\")  Their raspberry mascarpone cheesecake is heaven.  It melts in your mouth and the crust is the only thing left to chew.  The atmosphere: I think in all the times I've come here I've only sat inside once.  I love sitting outside watching the shoppers of Tivoli Village.  It always kind of freaks me out though when one of the valet boys starts running for a car.  I have to turn around and see the red uniform before I realize it's not some guy stealing a lady's purse.  Other than that, everything else is great.  The lighting adds a lot to the ambiance, from the restaurant, and other shops alike.  And my friends and I are always listening intently to the music, trying to guess the language and what they're saying.  I think coming to Brio is going to end up being a weekly thing for us.  We're all kind of night owls these days and we've got to start somewhere, best to do it where we can fill our stomachs and prep for the night ahead.",

I would have liked to have told the server that everything was cold but, sadly, she didn't bother to check back to see how everything was.

She kept us laughing and entertained. She mentioned that she was not on the floor that often but that she really enjoyed it. I'll give her credit; she is the best waitress I've ever had anywhere, hands down. She is fabulous.  I really wish I could remember the names of the plates we tried. We had a spicy pasta, pizza, and spinich artichoke dip. The food was fantastic!   The manager came over and apologized profusely for the mishap with the wine. She gave me her card and told me to bring in my dry cleaning receipt and the restaurant would reimburse me. Eh, clothes can easily be replaced. I was not going to let spilled wine ruin my night.  I really appreciate her offer, though, I won't be dry cleaning my jeans. They ended up comping our entire meal!  It was appreciated but definitely not necessary as I wasn't upset at all. We were so incredibly grateful.  Overall, great experience. I would definitely return.",

It gets a little busy on Thursday with their Martini special, but is always a fun time.  Happy hour is only available in the bar area, so get there early to claim your seat!  I highly recommend the cheeseburger and fries (and it's only $2.95!).",

    "text": "Beautiful location!  We have eaten once outside, and twice inside.  The service has been very nice each time.  I've had the Mezza Chicken, Eggplant Pomodoro and the grilled Salmon.  I would order each of them again, very delicious.  The calamari on the other hand was too salty for me, but others in my party enjoyed it.  The Quatro Bruschetta was disappointment.  I did have a bruschetta on the specialty menu with proscuitto and asparagus that was very tasty and I would have again.  I don't recall the names of all the drinks that I have tried; one was a martini with Absolute Raspberry, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice (missing some ingredients).  It was incredible!  The only problem was that it didn't come in a bigger glass, (careful, this one goes down quick).  The other was a strawberry lemonade with fresh strawberries, fresh basil and prosecco.  I know, fresh basil seems strange, but I'm going to try and make this one at home, I loved it so much!",

Our server, Tom, was on his A game. He greeted us and immediately got the drink order. What I appreciate is communication, and he let us know that he'd be right back. While taking our order, I let him know that I had a birthday voucher for Shrimp Scampi and beef medallions and my friend got the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with to Ceasar salads, in addition. The best was when Tom asked me how I wanted the medallions cooked. I asked Tom what the meat was and he said 'cow'. AWSOME! I laughed. The salads came right away and were delicious. Plenty of dressing and parm (the way I like it), with sweet Romain lettuce. Shortly after, came the fresh flat bread and bread basket with butter that tasted like it was homemade. This Brio seems more open and brighter than it's big sister. The food came the second my salad dish was removed and it looked beautiful. It tasted even better. It was an amazing birthday lunch and I am happy with our service from Tom. Thank you, Brio Tivoli!",

It did it twice; the first time we thought someone had flipped sauce on her, and three of us helped her get it out of her hair.  The second time, we looked around and noticed the bird above her head.  The staff was disgustingly unprofessional, insulted us with a 20 dollar gift card after we spent 500 dollars on food (that's not even enough to go back and have the meal paid for!!), the waiters and waitresses laughed, told other guests, swore, and mocked our family.  Your staff implying that a filthy disease ridden animal defecating on guests near the kitchen of your restaurant is out of the company's policy to make things right makes me shudder to think what else you would not help on.  I've had better customer service in every single other restaurant I've ever attended.  To make matters worse, when posting complaints on your Facebook wall, after talking to my sister in law who ever manages that account LIED and said she was fine with how things were handled!  Your customer service is disgusting and as we now see on more than just your one restaurants standard.  We are a family of 20 adults with in laws, 30 grandchildren and have been established in Las Vegas.  Your lack of class and neglegance has lost all of our business and all of extended family and friends business.",

At any rate I really enjoy the Brio at the Town Square location and thought I would give this new spot in Summerlin a try for a casual business dinner. I will save you sometime and just let you know it was a real solid choice. The food came out very quickly and the happy hour specials were priced rather inexpensively. Mid way through our meal the executive chef made his rounds and made sure to say hello to every table and introduce himself.  I have to say thats a rarity and the touch was well received.  I honestly have no problems recommending this place to anyone as the bruschetta choices are all amazing, the Veal Milanese was great, the ravioli were cooked to perfection, and the wine list had some great choices for excellent prices.",

We were very pleased we did not have to wait long at all.  We were impressed with the menu selection and had heard many great things.  This set our expectation high.  The food was good we ordered steak and pasta.  The service however was lacking.  Our water glasses were not checked and we were seated right next to the kitchen.  The manager was on her cell phone in the open kitchen having an emotional conversation and the staff did not appear to help each other out.  One of the waitresses was crying and two appeared to be angry at each other.  We highly value service and on our visit it was lacking.  By the end of the meal we were discussing that we would have enjoyed a meal at Carrabbas more.  It may have just been the evening we decided to go and we have discussed giving Brio another try, it wasn't bad but it was only OK and we were hoping for WOW!",

My husband and I have traveled across U.S. and even out of the country and that's how we learned how to love food. And we love love love fried calamari. The calamari we got was too much breading, tasteless and hard. The worst calamari we ever had that we could not even finish it (and I hate wasting food).

Had the shrimp and crab crepes for brunch.  Scrambled eggs, shrimp, crab, and asparagus rolled up in crepe served with fresh fruit and fried red potatoes.  Sounds awesome.  It was far from it,  To start off the smell of the over ripe melon in the fresh fruit overwhelmed my plate with a horrible smell.  Strike one.  Next I moved to the potatoes, over cooked to the point that  they were black and burnt to a crisp.  Strike two.  Next the crepes, the eggs were over cooked and dry, there was not crab or shrimp in them, the asparagus was flavorless and overcooked, and the hollandaise sauce taste like something out of a box or package.  Strike three.  Sadly they had a fourth strike as well.  Everything on my plate was the same temperature, the crepes and the potatoes were cold, and the fruit was warm.  I try to give everyplace a second chance, but I am not sure this place is worthy of that.",

We ordered the sampler bruschetta, stuffed peppers as an appetizer and split the risotto with roasted chicken for our entree. The bottom-line is the flavors were just not there. I noticed they have a pizza oven, so maybe their bar food is good. But, I would highly NOT recommend this place for dinner.",

    "text": "Five minutes after submitting the below review, I received a call from Jesse the General Manager.  He was very apologetic for our experience, and promised the service would improve.  So, I will be coming back with a follow up review after we visit gain, but I do have to give cud-dos to Jesse for the quick response to my email.  Never again will I visit this location on a busy night with or with out a reservation.  I am so frustrated with the service we received at the Tivoli Village location.  First of all, we had a reservation for 7pm last night which I had made on Open Table.  We arrived at 6:50pm and were told it would just be a few minutes.  We told the hostess we would wait in the bar and we ordered a bottle of wine with the intention of having a glass and taking it to our table.    By 7:30 pm, we went back to the hostess and told her we were still waiting.  She told us that were a couple of people ahead of us still, so we returned back to our seats at the bar.  At 7:40pm, our bartender Jose notified Jennifer (I believe, tall brunette lady working the bar) that we were still waiting.  She immediately contacted a manager (didn't talk to us, did this on her own initiative) who told her (and then she told us) that we would be next.  Finally, a bottle of wine down, we were seated at 7:55pm for our 7pm reservation.    I finally asked for a manager and was greeted by a manger (he didn't introduce his name) and voiced my frustration about the delay.  He told me that \"we are busy today\" and offered an appetizer which neither my date or I were interested in.  Instead, we told him we were ready to order and would like to order a bottle of wine (I made it clear we didn't want a free bottle)  but again had to wait nearly fifteen minutes for a bottle.    Anyhow, the risotto I had tasted hot but tasted as if it had been cooked early in the day and had been reheated several times.  Honestly, the whole experience was rushed and non romantic.  I was treated as number, and not as a customer.  Horrible experience, and the lack of remorse from the management really made this a bad experience that we will not repeat.",

They were so understanding, and when we apologized, told us not to because it was our special day and we shouldn't be sorry for anything. They were so accommodating and gracious. And the food was amazing. The lobster bisque was phenomenal. My best friends husband hates seafood, and even he loved it. I also have a friend who's vegan; they  crafted a dish just for her. My sister-in-law has a shellfish allergy, and they accommodated that without hesitation as well.

The cake was actually warm fudge, the salmon was over cooked, and the calamari was a cheap tasteless imitation of what used to be a really good dish. Extremely disappointing! Maybe the one on the boulevard is better. I'll give that one a try before giving up on them completely,",

Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us must be in a bad mood or in a rush. He did not introduce himself, I asked about their \"craft beer\", he said all they have is in the menu. So we ordered a beer and margherita drink. For dinner we ordered Campanelle Carbonara ,Grilled Chicken Marsala \"Under the Brick, and Caramel Cheesecake for dessert. The food was good not great, but I'm satisfied. The waiter never once checked on us if we needed anything which I was hoping for a glass of water. I wish that they would train all their waiters to be more polite and friendly.",

    "text": "This is another one of those places I've visited a dozen times or more in a variety of locations, but seem to fail to check in most of the time.  The accumulated experiences mandate that it's time for a review.  For a chain, I think it's one of the better ones.  Brio's food is consistently good and most of the time, above average for a chain restaurant.  We find ourselves going there with some frequency lately since this location is just a few miles from the house, in the nearby and still growing Tivoli Village.  Easy to get to, great underground parking (a huge plus in the summertime!), and a nice place to stroll after overeating.  (Yep, it's gonna happen.)  The food:  Two visits ago I had the Pasta Fra Diavalo.  Not my first pasta dish here because they do a great job with not overcooking the pasta.  The flavors were wonderful as alway and the dish was served at just the right temperature.  I don't know if they heat their dishes, but I noticed that the bowl didn't cause the pasta to cool rapidly--something that happens too often at many restaurants.  During my most recent visit I was able to sample a number of new tasty menu items:  a fresh Caprese Salad.  It was especially specially fresh and had just the right amount of dressing to allow the mild tomatoes and mozzarella to shine through.  Next the group of us shared a Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread, cooked well so that the flatbread was at just the right place between soft and too crisp.  Next, Black Pepper Shrimp featuring middle-sized, peeled shrimp served on slices of eggplant and drizzled in a fantastic sauce.  Brio found a great way to combine shrimp and eggplant into what became an instant favorite.  I'll definitely order it again.  I sampled Brio's take on bread pudding for dessert and was pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't normally order bread pudding, but I'm glad I had the chance to try this.  The portion was just right to follow a full meal and the pudding and sauce were delicious.  I'd definitely get it again.  The beverages:  If you're in the mood for a little wine with your dinner, I recommend the White Peach Sangria.  I'm not a fan of sweet wines or drinks, but this was nice and refreshing, and not too sweet to keep me from enjoying it.  The service:  Top notch for this kind of restaurant.  The staff is always there taking care of you, but they're not in the way or hovering.  I also love that they'll always tell you the specials, then make recommendations if you prefer.  I almost always ask and when recommendations come, they seem genuine rather than what might otherwise feel like they were told to push a particular dish that day.  Overall, well done Brio!",

My guest and I were seated right after a supremely difficult woman, the type that just makes a fuss about everything. This made for some interesting dinner conversation, to say the least, and the staff seemed to handle her well. Certainly better than I could have! I came to the conclusion throughout dinner that our waiter was not supposed to be taking care of our section but was just picking up the slack for another waiter or trying to get some extra tables. Even despite this, I am certain I will be back.  First off, the bread is sourdough! Any restaurant that has a default option of sourdough bread, sign me up. I had the lobster and shrimp fettucini and a chopped salad. Other Yelpers don't lie when they praise the chopped salad here! The shrimp and lobster pasta was as good as any I have ever head but still when I come back I think I will order a chopped salad. On the menu it is $5 and comes as a side, so maybe order two and ask them to combine it into a bowl. I am honestly surprised there is no entree option for this salad but I guess most people don't come to an Italian restaurant to have their cheapest salad option. It is that good though, so do yourself a favor and order it!",

The only drink specials I saw were $5 martinis on Thursday's.  Service was friendly and very welcoming and the food at is amazing. I recommend the Pasta Brio, which is rigatoni with a seared mushroom and peppers sauce, the Pasta alla Vodka, homemade pasta filled with ricotta, and the seared shrimp risotto is also delicious. Portions are good for the price and the menu has a lot of choices.  This is my favorite Italian restaurant in town. Everything is a hit in this place and if you haven't tried it yet you should get in your car and drive down there right now.",

I asked to be reseated and the hostess was extremely apologetic and quickly took care of the issue. She had the manager take me to a new table. When I explained what happened to him, he said nothing, but \"Would you like to order off the bar's happy hour menu in the main restaurant?\" While I appreciated that offer, an apology would have been the appropriate action, talking to the offended server would also have been an appropriate action (I doubt this happened). I've eaten there dozens of times and this manager is severely lacking in customer service skills.   5 stars for Jennifer the new server. She was friendly, knowledgeable and turned my dining experience around. Thank you Jennifer and the hostesses. Brio almost lost a neighborhood customer.",

My husbands pasta was lukewarm as was mine.  Mine came with grilled chicken and vegetables - those were hot, but not enough to compensate for the barely warm pasta.  And as for the grilled chicken on my pasta, it had the flavor and consistency of something that came from Sysco or US Foodways.  I'm not saying it was, but it definitely didn't taste like it was freshly cooked in house.  The bread and the butter was delicious.  The wine was excellent.  We'll go again as it's part of our neighborhood restaurant rotation, but I'm not sure I'd order the pasta again unless we were assured it would be hot.",

Drinks were always full.  Bread refilled.  He also brought us a free dessert.  The chocolate mousse was wonderful.  I would not go back",

    "text": "My husband, daughter, and I were checking out the beautiful newly opened Tivoli Village last Thursday, and Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the few restaurants that were 1.) already up and running and 2.) had a wait less than 20 minutes during the lunch peak hours.    The service was FANTASTIC, and that is probably because they just opened and are still in that \"honeymoon\"  phase.  Along with crayons and the kids menu to color, they also brought Pizza dough for my daughter to play with. They even offered to cook it for her when she was done- but she was having too much fun just playing with it.   I have never been to a Brio Tuscan Grille before so I had no expectations.  In fact, I didn't even know it was a chain restaurant at the time. Nonetheless, I am a fan of the food.  I ordered the Fettuccine Rustica and I highly recommend this dish if you like sun dried tomatoes.  I added the Bistecca Ensalata for an additional $3.95 and this salad was a meal in itself.  It was so delicious and so filling- I may just get a whole order of that next time since I am a sucker for gorgonzola cheese and bacon!  My husband ordered the chopped salad to start with and the Shrimp and Crab cakes.  It had only come with 2 average sized cakes, but they were so flavorful and surprisingly quite filling.  We ordered the kids lasagna for my daughter, and for $4.95- this was practically an adult serving.  In fact, the three of us shared it because it was that big, and that delicious!   The dessert display looked too fabulous to pass us, so I ate about 1/4th of my delicious pasta and had the rest packed up to take home.  We ordered the creme brulee and the raspberry cheesecake and both were the perfect way to end such a satisfying lunch.  The total bill for the 3 of us was less than $50. And it was well worth it- the ambiance, the service, the food were all great.",

Each of us ordered the Brio burger and let me tell you, I was impressed that it had great flavor, yet it wasn't heavy like some burgers at restaurants like this. My only compliant was that I ordered it medium, but it was slightly over medium.  However, it was still moist and juicy.   The beef carpaccio was delicious and so was the fried cheese ravioli.  For drinks I had the peach white sangria.  It tasted great and was very refreshing. The prices are the best I've seen yet for happy hour.  I spent about $13 for the burger, carpaccio, and drink.  Not too bad, especially when you're on a budget.  The service was also good. I'll definitely be back.",

The portions were huge for a Happy Hour serving and the service was really good.  I'll go again to try the ravioli or maybe just order off of the regular dinner menu.",

Not sure if he was having a day or was offended we ordered happy hour. Even though we ordered all but one app on the menu and cocktails. Food was so so and service was a complete fail. The 3 stars is for the spin dip and sangria. And the servers name was Clifford. Only knew this because of looking on my check. I'll continue my business at townsquare Brio from now on.",

Our server Justin was very helpful and fun to talk to, and he made our experience that much more enjoyable. I always get the flatbreads and bruschettas whenever I eat at Brio which are all very delicious. Their drinks are great as well, my personal favorite from their happy hour menu is the Santa Rosa. It's basically a rose sangria.",

    "text": "Last night (New Year's Eve) was my first time at Brio, and my friend and I came in for dinner before going out. It was busy, which was expected, but were able to find a perfect little table for two in the bar area. I'm not going to sugar-coat it - once we sat down, we waited for a really long time to get our order taken, to get our wine and bread, and to get our meals. But on busy nights even at good places, things can go wrong - and I'm a firm believer that it is 100% about how staff and management handle themselves. Brio did an excellent job at recovering our experience. Our wine order wasn't put in and we had to flag the manager down after 15 minutes of wondering what was up, but she got our wine to us, and took the glasses off the bill. In fact, while we were having dinner, our server even brought us over two extra glasses. (The wine was delicious, one of their pinot noirs, but I can't remember exactly which one.)  I didn't know what to expect out of our food since I'd never been here, but I was really impressed - the food is so good! I had a hard time deciding between their chicken pesto pomodoro, the pasta alla vodka and the pasta brio, but I decided on the pasta brio (rigatoni, roasted red pepper sauce, mushrooms and grilled chicken) since it's their signature dish and came highly recommended by our server. It was SO delicious and very flavorful - it wasn't spicy but still had the kick I crave! My friend had their chicken pesto over angel hair and didn't really love their pesto- according to our server it isn't True pesto - its base is chicken broth? So maybe that was why. But he ate it and had some of my pasta brio, and we both agreed that dish was incredible.  Coming in on such a busy holiday, I think everyone at Brio handled themselves very well, even when there were mishaps. The atmosphere was really nice - had good lighting and seemed sophisticated but also jovial. And you can't beat the location - Tivoli Village is so pretty. I loved our experience here and can't wait to come back and bring my husband!",

    "text": "Oh Brio's HAPPY HOUR is probably one of my top HH places! You can not beat their $3.95 appetizers and $5 drinks! Well actually before their apps were only $2.95 but hey it's only a $1 increase.. I can handle that! Haha my must haves when I go are the beef carpaccio & spinach artichoke dip! My man and I usually share the burger as well.. The sucky part about this place would be that you can never tell if you're going to be able to get a spot or not.. The best place to sit is inside in one of the booths or outside by the firepit if you have a big group but it can get pretty busy.  ... Boo! But hey what can you do..!?  Tip: It is right in front of the COMPLIMENTARY valet! easy and fast~",

    "text": "Though we live pretty close to Tivoli, this was our first visit to Brio for dinner.  Our last attempt was for Happy Hour a year ago, but we bailed when we were directed to sit on the side of the patio in which every seat was in full sun -- and it was 112 outside!  Happily, though the temp was five degrees hotter tonight, we ate in air-conditioned comfort.  We were with friends who are soon-to-be locals (if the husband ever gets his way), and our waitress, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, was extremely attentive and efficient throughout the meal.  For starters, we ordered the Bruschetta Sampler platter.  None of us realized until we were biting into different tastes that it was made up of all the different bruschettas they offered.  Some had prosciutto, some broiled tomato, and some were heavy on the balsamic (this is a good thing).  We enjoyed it a lot.  We also liked the Spinach and Artichoke dip, with the crunchy triangles of flatbread that accompanied it.    Brio tends to have a Mediterranean flair that tries to up it a notch from straight Italian, but for me this wasn't a plus.  I do love the food at Mediterranean restaurants, and am also a fan of Greek cuisine, but I'm not keen on feta cheese.  While trying to decide on an entree, almost everything I wanted to order had feta.  Happily, I was able to substitute gorgonzola in the Mediterranean Shrimp dish I settled on.  I could have also changed it to parmesan.  Four nicely-broiled shrimp sat atop a delicious melange of orzo, farro, broccoli, and artichokes.  I haven't had farro before (though I have a package of it in my pantry waiting for me to cook), and I liked the nuttiness that it added to the mixture.  If I hadn't already been full from the appetizers, I might have thought that there should have been one more shrimp on the plate.  Then again, it was 14.95, the shrimp were meaty, and I was stuffed before I started.  Two others ordered Chicken Milanese, and the third had Filet Mignon, which came with veggies and his choice of crisply roasted potatoes instead of the mashed it came with.  I didn't taste them, but they looked like a small version of potato skins without all the toppings, and he really liked them.  The Chicken Milanese was covered with mozzarella, which is unusual.  Add some red sauce and they would have had chicken parm.  That was served with a side of linguine in a plain tomato sauce.  The chicken was reported to be tender and perfectly cooked.  We shared a bottle of California Riesling; I think it was Wente, and wasn't overly sweet or dry, just right.  My only nit was the bread, because the dense bread with the hard crust that I love turned out to be sourdough.  I don't like sourdough, but others will disagree with me.  Other than that, it was a very enjoyable meal.  And we'll try Happy Hour again if the heat wave ever breaks.  Like in October  :)",

Brought us back bread and waters. We ordered wine and shortly after, our meals. Our meals came out quickly and hot. It was delicious. He ordered a steak and I ordered a pasta dish. Our server checked on us several times, bringing us more wine, more bread and refilling our waters. After eating, we paid our bill and sat and talked until we noticed a line forming at the door. We felt bad for keeping a table so we moved to the bar area for more wine. The staff there was attentive as well. The bar area is a nice area on the side, I think next time we might try sitting outside by the fires. We'll definitely be back.",

The Cabernet and fresh bread was tempting. Wooded base cab and a Caesar salad helped tempt me for my later entree. Ravioli, sauteed mushrooms with a white sauce helped me enjoy this dining experience. A Samuel Addams helped close the night. Ill sure return for another grace keep evening at Brio's",

We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated. But once we were seated, we were greeted right away by Gus. We ordered: the spaghetti bolognese, beef carpaccio, caprese salad, lobster bisque soup, and calamari.  The spaghetti bolognese was so creamy! It was amazing. The beef carpaccio is ALWAYS on point. So flavorful. The caprese salad was... eh, nothing special. The lobster bisque soup was some of the best soup I have ever had, to be completely honest. And the calamari was nothing short of yum. For dessert we got the chocolate cake with a side of vanilla gelato. It was okay, nothing spectacular. But I'll definitely be back for the beef carpaccio and lobster bisque!",

The spaghetti bolognese took much longer because they messed up by giving what the chef called spaghetti but was actually not. It was wayyy to thin and flat to be spaghetti. They remade it using actual spaghetti when I explained what spaghetti was LOL. (I would know because it's what I order every single time aEverything was very good and the view from Brio was beautiful on a sunny Saturday with the harvest festival going on in Tivoli Village.",

    "text": "Came here for my daughters birthday dinner.  Everyone liked their food, the service was excellent.  My food could have been better but I should have went with other people's recommendation who have eaten here before.  Let's start at the beginning. We ate on a Saturday night using a reservation for a party of 8 (easy breezy).  We were sat very quickly after checking in.  If we didn't have so many people it would have been perfect to sit outside.  After our order, the food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  The portions are generous and you could probably share, in fact if you are craving more than one thing, I would probably suggest having on person order one dish and the other person something else and then sharing.  Especially if you order Chicken Milanese and Lasagna for example.  You get two nice pieces of chicken when you order the Chicken Milanese.  If you order the way Brio normally makes Lasagna it will come out with mostly Alfredo sauce and some Marinara (red) sauce.  Ask for it in all red/Marinara  sauce.  That's they way most of my table had it and they were happy.  I had it with Alfredo, not that it wasn't good, but the creaminess of the Alfredo kind of softened the great taste of a traditional Lasagna.  I would have been better off ordering it the way everyone else did.",

It's an open kitchen and you can see pretty much what happens in there. The chefs, cooks, & servers seem to have a great dynamic -- service is great and food gets out quick.    I've had most things on the menu, but I'm very partial to the Double Cut Porkchop with Gorgonzola crust. Amazing! Also, the cauliflower side is my favorite.   Don't sleep on the Mascarpone Cheesecake as well for dessert. 10/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "Talking about a disaster. I am writing this review immediately after one of the worst services i've experienced ever. I have never been so ticked off by a server in my entire life. The service provided by this server named Monica (as indicated on the receipt) in the outside area was just pathetic.   Our friend arrived at the table early and got a table on the outside. But when we arrived, because we had our dog, we requested a different table where my dog could be better isolated from the rest of the crowd and the two other little puppies near by. The reason for this was that even though my dog is friendly but she loves food too much and she begs other people for food. When we asked for a different table, what we got was a sarcastic response from the host that \"well your server won't be (name).\" nevertheless, she reluctantly left all the menus and left. I was pretty annoyed by that response but decided not to let something like that messes up our perfect morning.   Well that was just the beginning. Our server Monica was just awful. I don't think she knows how to smile. My mother asked if there was any breakfast entree, she snatched the menu from my mom's hands, turned it around and tapped on the menu to show her the two breakfast entree. I almost stood up in my seat to confront her but my mom kept me on my seat. I then said I am not ready to order yet because we just sat down, Monica just turned around and left. There was no \"I will give you guys a minute to decide.\"   The service remained laughably bad throughout. She only gave us two water even though we had a party of 3. I needed a coffee refill; I gotta ask someone else for it. I needed water refill; Glgotta ask someone else for it. I needed a change of your drink because a bug fell in it? I asked politely and she gave me a dirty look, turned around without saying a word. She then came back 5 minutes later with the drink and left it on my table without saying a word and then turned around and left. It was like if I was causing her the biggest trouble in the world. Never once did she come by check how we were doing like the other Brio servers would do normally. Never once did she come by to refill any of the drink we ordered.   The only thing that stopped from me going to a manager just now is because we didn't want to mess up our perfect morning with a friend we haven't seen in awhile. But the more I think about her pathetic service, the angrier I get. Her service was unacceptable.   My family is regular here and they said this was an isolated incident. But still this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I am in disbelief that this type of service is allowed at a Brio resturant. I am reasonable so I will give one star for the good food and the other servers who were great at helping us becuase Monica couldn't. In all honesty, the experience deserved not a single star.",

I had their Brio Sliced Steak Salad - This was SO GOOD and I LOVED it.  The salad had tender slices of steak with a chopped salad that had a delicious balsamic dressing along with tomatoes, gargonzola, mushrooms, spicy pecans and I think there was a bit of creamy horseradish that gave it that perfect BITE with the steak!! Wish they had this dish at home!   We also had the special which was the Seared Scallops with Risotto - I think my hubby pretty much inhaled this dish and the plate licked clean!  Other family members had the Lobster and Risotto!  The TAIL was HUGE - they LOVED it and each of the risottos were paired with wine which went perfectly with each of the dishes!  We were so stuffed we couldn't eat dessert but i have to tell you - the food, service, atmosphere was PERFECT! We sat around and enjoyed our meal and company with water glasses getting filled and just great service all around.  I actually wish we had a Brio Tuscan Grille in the bay area but at least now we know a go to place when in Vegas!!",

Was told 15-20 min, which seems pretty standard at 8pm -- showed up 30 min after order and was told it would be another 10 min.... this was after waiting 5 for someone to show up at the host/hostess desk... I was hoping that the food would taste as good as memory served me and at least be worth the annoyance- unfortunately, quality must have been on the chopping block here... $55 dinner for two ... such a waste - I chose this over the Olive Garden for flavor and over Maggianos due to the fact they get my order right only half the time.  BUYERS REMORSE all the way.  Food was bland and flavorless - tasted like reheated Olive Garden and for 2x the price! Plus the wait I would have had at Maggianos along with the aggravation of being quoted the wrong pick up time and offered empty apologies. Unless you're good with overpaying for a low quality meal, I would recommend elsewhere- there is an Italian place down the street that at least still takes pride in quality food and customer service. Will not be back ever again; a shame - I have had birthdays here, brunches here, date nights here and it was always fairly decent.  It has been about a year since my wife and I had the taste to swing into a Brio - but will not make that mistake again.",

The food it self was for the most part better than last time.  The shrimp and eggplant was way better its was seasoned perfectly the calamari was lightly battered and the margherita flat bread was great.  The lobster bisque was very tasty.

Then showed up the complimentary beef carpaccio from Manager to accommodate for delay. We've had much better service and food. Still love this place. But the service could be better.",

The busser was attentive as well!!  Unfortunately the waiter seemed to not be very interested in taking care of us.  I specifically told him when there were only 3 of us there that I wanted what I ordered to be on a separate check that would be brought to me.  At the end of the evening I asked for my bill only to be told that it was all on one.  He then stated he hadn't heard me.  Did say that he would handle it but then STILL brought a single check.  Had to ask for bread three separate times which was finally brought by the bus boy.  We will be back ONLY because the food was really hood but will hopefully get a different waiter!!",

    "text": "This review is for happy hour in the bar only.  If you are lucky enough to grab a table inside or outside before 630 pm you are definitely set to enjoy a budget friendly happy hour.  It was a Wednesday night about 6pm I was lucky enough to grab a table in the bar area.  It was very busy.  There was some weird guy playing a guitar and singing to keep me and my friend entertained while we waited for the table to be cleared and cleaned.  Not sure if this is a regular thing for brio now providing live entertainment but it was the first I have seen. In any case he was ok, not terrible.  Lol. Our waitress I believe it was Monica K. ( at least that's the name on our receipt) was great!  She ended every sentence with...\"it's my pleasure\".  Even though it was obvious she was slammed, she never lost her cool and never lost her smile.  She came around to let us know last call for happy hour, which was greatly appreciated.  We ended up with three martinis, one spinach and artichoke dip, two brio burgers and one chocolate cake all for $40.87.  What a steal! Especially since the food is great too!  Burgers are juicy. They have a great variety of items on their happy hour food menu.  In addition to a happy hour drink menu, brio offers $5 martinis all day Wednesday's and $5 wines all days Thursday's. Give it a try and check it out. They have a big outdoor patio.  See you there!",

The last time I went to a Brio was the Town Square location, with my wife, on our second date, four years ago. It hasn't improoved in that time.   My chopped dinner salad was a good portion, but very dry and tasteless.  My wife had the \"big\" pork chop. It was big and meaty, but very dry. My daughter in law had a chicken dish worthy of a cheap buffet. I forgot what my son ordered, but I tasted it, and it wasn't very good.  The service was very good. Our bread baket was constantly refilled, our drinks always full, and when my wife complained to the manager about her dry pork, the manager did offer a substitute, but we were already full (mostly of bread).  She did send a comp'd desert as a way of saying \"sorry\".  Even though the service was very good, I would say it was a Rich Man's Bucca Di Peppo, with smaller portions, and an alternative for a High School Date to The Olive Garden.",

My favorite item by far and it was only $7.50! I also had a glass of Sketchbook pinot noir and it was nice with dinner and reasonably priced at $9.00 a glass.  Food: The caprese salad was good quality ingredients and reasonably portioned. My only complaint is it def needed more balsamic. Their balsamic is a good one by the way. We also had the lasagna bolognese. This item was really tastey. Nothing crazy extravagant and certainly nothing to complain about. It was just a great item  The prices were pretty good in my opinion. 10-20 a person without drinks. When we got there we were seated on the patio. The weather was fantastic so that only added to the awesome atmosphere.   My only complaint for the evening was our waitress. She was a total bug a boo. I felt rushed and like she wanted us out of there.  However, the staff was amazing other than her and I can tell she was the only annoying staff member.",

None of the food was that good - I ordered the Balsamic Braised Beef Short Rib which was under-seasoned, bland and absent much flavor (er... saaaay Balsamic vinegar!?); my daughter ordered Pasta Alla Vodka which was slightly better.  Substantial portions, neither was worth taking home as left-overs.  The wine pour was mediocre.  Appitizer of Artichoke Dip was the star of the show; dessert of Dolchino Trio was great.  Server was friendly enough, but service sucked (disappearing for long periods of time; needing to be reminded of our requests numberous times - frankly I think he may have just had too many tables, despite the nearly 7p seating and a 1/3 full restaurant).  Hostess was wonderful, both being on the ball once we arrived; stewarding a late arrival back to our table; offering to charge my phone at the front when I was looking for an oulet.  Bigger price for an Olive Garden experience.",

    "text": "The quality of food at Brio is a pleasant surprise.  The lunch menu has a lot of variety and I probably would have been happy ordering one of 4 or 5 different things, but lasagna wins almost every time, and Brio's version is quite nice.  It comes with your choice of 3 different salads (chopped, Caesar, or house) and I was very happy with the chopped.  Far more than a boring plate of greens, and it isn't drowning in dressing.   The lasagna arrived not long after, and it's made with white sauce, meat, and the usual noodles/cheese/sauce.  I dove in and was a little sad when I took the last bite because for a second, I contemplated ordering another.  It's nicely balanced, has just a teeny tiny amount of burned edges of cheese/noodle.and the meat is moist, like a meatloaf.  Mimosa wasn't anything to get too excited about, but the raspberry gelato (not on the dessert tray) was the perfect amount of dessert.  Allegedly Brio may make its way to California, and I can't wait!  So much better than Olive Garden!",

    "text": "I've been here twice and Brio has done just swell. Start with a decent wine, of which they have many. You don't have to break the bank to get a good one. We found a nice Ruffino that we liked so much, we had a couple bottles. Small groups do great here -- especially in the sharing department. (The bread/cracker basket is dangerous, be forewarned).   Now, should you order the carpaccio appetizer (which I recommend you do), be prepared for a large portion that you'll either share, or have no need for an entree.  Good meat, tangy argula and shaved parm: all good.   This second time, I was set to have a salad but randomly queried if there was anything not on the menu. Gazpacho I was told, and yay to that!  It had excellent flavors, and a pleasant texture, complemented with just enough kick. Mmm. And it was cold, of course. Truly an excellent way to start a meal -- especially since it was, um, 110 degrees outside -- at least!  Despite the weather, we were very comfortable inside. Service flowed effortlessly -- or maybe that was the wine. Still, I enjoyed a very good Filet, cooked to order. This is not a steakhouse, of course. Rather Brio has many things they offer - with a Mediterranean way about them. Entrees are typically served with their mashed potatoes (which I couldn't imagine), but our Server was flexible: she easily swapped the spuds for spinach.   The pastas looked, and I'm told, are good. There was a nice salmon a few folks ordered. Tasted it myself, and it was perfectly fine -- with some memorable flavors that right now I forget. Really, there were no sour notes here. Which leads me to dessert --- always fun with a group. We tried several, and they were all outstanding. Seriously, we must have had three or four we worked on. Top things off with good coffee, or espresso, and you're good.",

I was raised by a real Italian mama and nothing comes close to her sauce, her meatballs, her pasta dishes. I am terribly critical of most Italian restaurants and therefore am very hard to please.   I will say that Brio Tuscan Grille has thoroughly impressed this Italian palate. I avoided it like the plague when it opened at Town Square, but when it opened at Tivoli I decided to give Brio a chance. One chance!  Well it turned out one chance was all it needed because Brio knocked my Italian socks off.   The pasta alla vodka was tremendous, with ricotta stuffed pasta in a cheesy cream sauce. The top was sprinkled with pancetta and basil and the dish was large enough to bring some home for lunch.  A friend ordered the lasagna and it was huge - seriously enough for two people.  On my most recent visit, we decided to hit the bar before heading over for some wine tasting. What a treat we found in that bar....in the form of a $2.95 menu!!! Wow, it was awfully tasty, and with such selections as ravioli caprese, shrimp and eggplant (EXCELLENT) and a gigantic burger. Oh and Wednesday is Martini night - $5 martinis -- yippee!!!!  Good food, good service, good prices. Seriously, what's not to love?",

Of course, our server, Julio, made the night even more special. His professionalism and attention rate him at the top in people skills, making this dining experience an epicurean delight in a most comfortable and relaxed ambiance. Thank you also to Jesse, manager extraordinaire, for his most personable approach and care. Happy hour is very special!! Dinners are divine! Sunday Brunch is a must!! Experienced them al!! Enjoy Brio!!",

I've had everything off the happy hour menu and its extremely fresh and still pretty big portions. The only thing I wish was them having a better beer selection, but I can not complain because their food makes up for it.  So stop by after work and enjoy a nice fresh happy hour meal.  3:30-6:30 is the happy hour time!",

It's True folks, Tivoli- Brio blew me away with their attentiveness and spectacular customer service during my dinner last night.  Greeted by two perky hostesses the (I assume) Manager escorted my date and I to our table.  Before we could even place the cloth napkins on our laps our server was at our table kindly taking our drink orders.    Sifting through the menus placed on the table, wine list, dinner menu, I stumbled upon the GLUTEN FREE menu! Yes, a special menu just for me.. My excitement continued when I browsed the decent list of gluten free options, including pasta.  Fellow allergy sufferers would agree that most restaurants name their basic protein dishes their \"gluten free option's\"..pause while I yawn.. But I digress.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Cesar salad with CRISP, fresh Romain lettuce, dressed to perfection. My taste buds were then taken on a gluten free amazing pasta trip that was out of this world..  Two glasses of wine and a full belly later, this girl was a happy diner.  The manager checked on our table while we dined, bussers were exceptionally attentive clearing plates promptly, and our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive as well.  All in all I give this Brio (2) very solid thumbs up.  I sincerely hope they keep up the above average customer service and delicious gluten free menu options.  West Side, should we meet again and I am in the mood for Italian food, Brio you're at the top of my list!",

Even though our server was very nice and very helpful, you can tell that she was rushed, Not stressed, just rushed. She needed some assistance which I didn't see anybody else helping her. Besides that, I would highly recommended for a very good experience in dining.",

The staff was very attentive the only thing is that it seemed they tried to get too many of us to sit in a too small of space so we were a bit squished. Other than that the food was of course excellent.  We also have been there for brunch. Their breakfast food is not as good as their regular stuff. Love the location. So nice to sit outside in the evenings and look at the surroundings.",

We got there 20 minutes before out 8:45 reservation and were hoping to be seated earlier, but unfortunately it was just super busy and we were seated at res. time. We spent some time looking over the menu and it did take a while to order. My gf ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta which she said was very good if not phenomenal. I ordered the filet only to find a few minutes later that they just ran out. So, I went with the New York Fiorentina which turned out to be quite good as far as New Yorks go (not usually my favorite). Grilled and seasoned very well which is a must for the chewier cut. Overall recommended with friendly and professional service.",

Their servers at this location are OK. The past 2 times I haven't had the best service, and I was actually surprised that the service on a Monday afternoon was terrible. Took quite awhile for everything and the busser decided to take our dessert before we were even done with it.. said he would bring another one because it was his fault, but never returned with another dessert. Oh well. Will always come back to Brio though!",

Would be giving 5 stars but our service was a bit slow. All of us were very thirsty and our server seemed annoyed that I wanted her to take down our visit credit.
