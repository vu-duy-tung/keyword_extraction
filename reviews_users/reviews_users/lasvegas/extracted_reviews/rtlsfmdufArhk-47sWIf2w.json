    "text": "I wish I could give them 6 stars!! The best meal I have had in a while! Started off in the bar with a bottle of wine while waiting for our table. The bartender was so kind, we were talking about Hawaii (he is from there and we just went there). The wine selection is one of the largest I have seen. The bread selection was overwhelming! I wanted to eat them all! Love how the butter is room temp. So many restaurants over look this tiny detail and its so disappointing to have wonderful bread and hard butter.  I started with the escargot (amazing flavor, cooked to perfection, not chewy at all!), my fiancee had the frois gras which was so rich and creamy.   Main course I had the potato encrusted sea bass with pinot reduction. So light and flakey. Fish melted like butter. My fiancee had the butter poached lobster with lobster stuffed tortellini. I can't even describe accurately how fabulous this dish is.  Now on to one of the best parts... dessert! I had the Grande Marnier souffle. For those who said it tasted like straight liqueur are out of their mind! It tasted like sweet oranges to me! Creme Brulee was the best I have ever had. The Tahitian  vanilla makes all the difference.  The service was so hands on and friendly. Considering the type of place this is you would think the servers would be a little up tight. But the were all so nice and accommodating. We chit chatted about football and other common interest. I love the small intimate dining room. We will be returning here on our next visit to Vegas. It is worth every single penny!",

    "text": "I decided to try a decent restaurant during my last trip to Las Vegas, and finally I was able to secure a reservation at this place.  It sits near the famous Bellagio water fountain with an incredible view of the hourly shows.  The restaurant atmosphere is warm and intimate.  It's clear that circus is the theme, a very exquisite circus that is.  Since the Degustation Menu was available with awesome wine pairing selection, we decided to give it a try.  It's a 5 main course meal with goodies in between, and we had a wonderful experience.  First Course: - White Asparagus, Scottish Smoked Salmon, New Potatoes Crusted Farm Egg, Osetra Caviar, Sorrel Puree, Ravigote Vinaigrette  Very good mixture of caviar and salmon.  Everything tasted exceptional well together  - Santa Barbara Sea Urchin \"Ice Cream\", Ginger-Lemon Grass Gelee, Fennel Mousse  Words can't describe how great this dish was.  Uni melts in my mouth and the mousse is amazing!  Remember to dig to the bottom with your spoon, so you can enjoy the layers in one bite!  Second Course:  - Sauteed Sonoma Foie Gras, White Chocolate & Raisin Brioche, Roasted Rhubarb, Cardamom Streusel, Ibiscus & Champagne Gastrique  THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal! Never tasted any Foie Gras that's as good as this!  The wine pairing of a 1929 port is amazing.  The sweetness of the wine really did a wonderful job breaking down the fatty taste of the Foie Gras.  Highly recommended!  The waiter also spent some time intriguing me with the technique French used to preserve grapes that's over 80 years old!   -Risotto in Rhythm with the Season  Solid dish with lots of flavors  Third Course:  -Traditional Seafood Bouillabaisse, Fennel Confit, Purple Vitelottes, Shellfish Fumet, Saffron Rouille  -Chilean Sea Bass, Purple Artichoke, \"Grenaille\" Potatoes, Chanterelles, Tomato Confit, Verbena Sauce  Again, very solid dishes with exceptional taste  Fourth Course:  - Honey Glazed Barbary Duck Magret, Daikon Duck Confit, Spiced Sweet Potato, Bing Cherry au Foie Gras, Ruby Port Sauce   Very well made duck confit.  The mixture of sweet and salty taste is perfect! Duck meat is tender and full of flavor.  - Bucatini Timbale, Kobe Beef Oxtail, Perigord Truffles, Daube Sauce   The presentation is amazing.  At first it looked like a cup made out of noodles, but once I dug in, the juicy beef center flooded out.  Very flavorful!  Beef tasted unique and out of this world!  Fifth Course: (Desserts)  Well dessert is dessert.  They will fill you up if you are still hungry. :)  Overall, the quality of the food is on par with restaurants at this level and service is excellent.  Highly recommended if you are planning to enjoy a wondering dining experience.",

    "text": "Perfect. My boyfriend and I ate at Le Cirque on May 17th for his birthday. We had the degustation menu, we ordered different plates, he had the Premium Wine Pairing and I had the Sommelier to taste as many wines and plates as possible. The food was perfectly prepared, nothing over or undercooked, perfect textures and flavors. I won't go through every dish because I don't feel like writing a novel (I will, please read the whole thing, it's quite funny) but everything was perfect.  The food was perfect, but the wine pairings and the service just brought the experience through the roof. I've had many degustation/tasting menus and wine pairings and have never had such perfect selections for each dish. They elevated everything without taking away from the food. The sommeliers (Tom and Frederick?.. I'm not positive about the names) were really just walking encyclopedias of wine and liquor. The service was absolutely perfect. You never ran out of water, the timing between dishes was perfect, they were attentive without being intrusive and were friendly and personable which is a nice reprieve. My biggest complaint for most \"fancy\" restaurants is that I always felt like if I breathed wrong I would be escorted out and black carded and that the servers were too uptight... simply robots reciting the same thing over and over. The service was perfect and personable.    My only disappointment for the evening is partly my fault because the menu lists a \"dessert fantasy\" and I am um... a uh.. fiend for sweets. I'm a pastry cook. And an oversized child with a paycheck. So when I read \"dessert fantasy\" in my mind I'm thinking the lights go out, the sparklers go off whilst servers dance around me (somehow the floor is now an ice rink and they are in fact ice skating now) placing hundreds of desserts/pastries on my table and each time I take a bite the dessert would morph into a new one, maybe Willy Wonka joins me... but that's my fault. The reality (the worst part of anything) is you get to order a dessert from the dessert menu.. I kind of wish they had an option where you could have a tiny bite of every single one because well.. I wanted to try every single dessert ever. However, dessert was whimsical, delicious and perfect.   I honestly wish I could've tipped 100% for the service and convinced the higher ups to reward them raises, but alas I am without power. /sigh. You will not be disappointed by choosing Le Cirque. If you truly love food and wine (as in, passionate and legit get a little turned on by good food) then you will marry Le Cirque. In fact, you will be smiling/giggling like a complete lunatic the whole time during your dining experience and will probably be smiling the whole evening afterwards. I'm pretty sure anybody that saw us thought we were high on um... not life. But we were high on Le Cirque.  I apologize for abusing the word perfect. IT WAS PERFECT! PEEERFEEECT!!",

What made this place extra special was the friendly and very helpful wait staff.

(What a concept!)  But....if you're the type that doesn't want to talk to the wait staff and just wants to concentrate on the meal....you won't be disappointed!  Each dish was full of intricate favors, and was beautifully presented.  I ordered the wine pairing which made it even better!  I definitely would recommend this place, and want to return soon!",

We finally were able to make time and we were anxiously awaiting the experience. We opted for the Prix Fixe menu and the wine pairing that accompanied it (3 course), $150 pp which is completely reasonable, we thought.    We thought everything was \"good\", but that was the extent of it.  We had the Escargot, Sea-Bass, Chicken and Creme Brulee.  Again, everything was \"good\", but we could not honestly recommend any of these items.  The 3 wine pairings with each meal were different per entree, but none were worth the equivalent of $16 per glass or however the breakdown worked out (3 glasses for $50).  The best thing about the meals were the mini-desserts and \"red box\" treats.  What am I supposed to do with that \"red box\" now???  I have no problem paying $400 for an exceptional meal, unfortunately this was not that type of experience!  Sincerely disappointed!!",

    "text": "We LOVED our dinner at Le Cirque. The atmosphere is quiet and intimate. The decor, with draped canopy on the ceiling, feels romantic. The chairs are comfy. Our server was so attentive he made me nervous (haha). We opted for the pre-theatre menu without wine pairing (although I wish I had). Everything was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  Complementary: One-bite Lobster Cake with Tomato Soup/Sauce - The lobster cake was good, although with just one bite, \"good\" is the only word I can describe it with. The tomato soup/sauce was a little too sour.  Bread & Butter - We both had the rosemary bread and loved it. It was fresh and still hot, there are bacon and some other stuff in there so the bread had flavor as is, but even better with the butter.  Appetizer: Risotto du Marche - Mushroom Risotto. It was delicious, very flavorful, creamy but still with some bite. The nuts in there (macadamia I think?) made the dish more interesting.  Bisque de Homard - I had a couple bites of this from my boyfriend's plate, the soup was smooth and creamy and very flavorful, although boyfriend said it gets salty half way through.  Main Course: Dos de Saumon Ecossais - The salmon was done to perfection, with the center still tender, but a bit too salty for my taste. I LOVED the parmesan gnocchi on the side, I got sad as they disappear on my plate.  Coeur de Filet de Boeuf - The steak too, was done to perfection (boyfriend asked for medium rare). I didn't have any of the side one-bites, but I did had a bite of the steak, and it was so so flavorful.  Dessert: We were served three things: Chocolate Sphere with Praline Mousse, White Chocolate Ice Cream, and Hazelnut Caramel Crunch for me, Young Coconut with Passion Fruit Mousse, Pineapple Compote, and Mango Sorbet for my boyfriend, and a platter of five two-bites for the both of us.  Watching the Chocolate Sphere melt open as they pour hot chocolate sauce on it was as good as eating the sphere itself. The Coconut dessert was so good I stole it from my boyfriend and gave him my sphere. It was foamy on the surface, the sorbet was tangy, and there are real fruits in there.  At the end, we were given a cute little drawer with two chocolates inside to take home. I anticipated trying this place out and we were both glad that we did.",

Tables were not spaced very far apart...I could literally TOUCH the woman sitting at the table next to ours if I reached out and I could clearly overhear the conversations at neighboring tables. I did like how the dining room looked like you were inside a circus tent.  Food portions were smallish, but that is kind of expected for a tasting menu. I actually wasn't completely full after finishing the entire 5-course meal...unfortunately, but it was still filling. The flavors were good in each dish, but nothing really special that blew my mind. Their A4 Kobe beef was the winner of the meal...closely followed by their sauteed foie gras, but beware, the small 2\" by 3\" piece of Kobe beef also came with an additional supplement cost of $65...  Good solid restaurant, however, the ambiance was not very romantic. It honestly felt more like a casual restaurant that served fancier food. Service was was not very personable or friendly. The servers came off aloof and very curt with their descriptions for each dish.  (The other Michelin-starred restaurant at Bellagio offers much larger portions on their tasting menu, more creative flavors, better service, ambiance with more privacy, a superb view of the fountains, but surprisingly at very similar prices).",

    "text": "What an overall beautiful place but the food was way under par especially for a dinner costing $135 per person.  My boyfriend and I went to Le Cirque with great expectations. When we arrived and through the experience the service was phenomenal and that is why they got 2 stars.  Let me get to the major problems we faced. Our main dishes came out at around 11pm when the restaurant closes. Not only was my chicken room temperature at best but my boyfriend's single lamb chop was pretty much raw. We both love very rare meat but when the fat has not been rendered at all and is completely cold and chewy then we have a problem.  We sent the two dishes back and they apologized for the food being cold and not cooked. They said they would remake everything. Well at 1130 and a complete empty restaurant, our entrees were brought out again. At that point we had been there for 2.5 hrs. We asked them to box everything up and that we wanted to leave. The final portion of the tasting menu was the dessert which we didn't even experience. They gave us a box of macarons to take with us as well.  I was pretty shocked to say the least. Not only did they royally mess up the main course but we didn't even have the dessert. They saw we wanted to get out of there so they brought us the bill. Too bad that dinner was so disappointing and for $450 was a waste of money and our time. I'm glad we experienced Le cirque because it's supposedly one of the best restaurants in Vegas but needless to say we will not be back. For that kind of price tag the food better be perfect and you better serve all of it to your customers. Very disappointing how the entire situation was handled by the restaurant.",

I got the salad - I dont remember the name  (maybe that's why I was refused Elite 13 by Yelp - Im a bad yelper) Thus, this salad is the first one in the menu.   On the huge white plate there was a small green salad which looked like a roll with avocado, asparagus all some other green stuff inside and it was covered by a thick slice of cucumber. On the other side of the plate there was a lobster tail (perfectly cooked!) and on the third side there was a piece of the meat from crab claw.  Great combination! Perfect size! the ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and chic. Very elegant ceiling covers and 5 stars view on the belagio lake  - Thus, every half an hour you could see the dance of the fountain. At the end, we received cute little gifts from the restaurant  - So I didnt have to buy a souvenir for my bf. Cute box with 2 candies.",

Ok one complaint... and maybe kinda snobby, but... when you go to a great restaurant like this and take the time to dress up and look nice and they let guys in not a whole lot more than a crummy step up from t-shirts and jeans... well... just sayin...

The decor is amazing, put us in the mood for the quirky french-carnival style O show later that evening.  The staff was so friendly (it had all the opportunity to be pretentious but was never for one moment, not a hint of snobbery)  the \"team\" of servers were amazing!  I have Celiac disease, and the way they accommodated my food allergy from the first moment was so appreciated!  Every course was a delight, it's own form of joy and entertainment.  We chose the \"pre-show\" dinner which includes 5 courses and wine pairings and a souvenir jewelry box of truffles besides the delectable dessert AND petit fours.    Our dishes were expertly crafted, and I told our server at the end I had the greatest desire to march into the kitchen and give them all a standing ovation!  And to have window seating where we had an up close view of the famous Bellagio fountain show!  Of all places we have ever eaten in Vegas on all 4 of our visits now, this was hands down the best experience. Bravo!",

    "text": "this was absolutely the worse fine dining experience i've ever had (and as our host had pointed out, i would know, i'm from SF). not merely because the food wasn't that great, but because the restaurant botched my experience altogether.  i made reservations for a party of 2 on a thursday night for my bf's birthday celebration. i called again the day of to make sure they had that the restaurant knew we were celebrating a birthday and to sit us by the window so we can have a view of the water show. during our dinner, the waiter/servers/host (a group of what? 5-6 people altogether) completely forgot the fact that it was bf's birthday.   fine, ignore my request to sit by the window even though a table was readily available and given to the party of two after us, ok...be oblivious to the fact were celebrating his birthday...including no \"happy birthday\" writing on the dessert, but to hand him the check at the end and thank us for coming...well that was pretty much all i could take. i pretty much burst into tears on the spot.   i don't know how many fanciful restaurant can pride themselves on ruining a perfectly good evening and making a girl cry because of their crappy service, but this one is definitely a winner for ruining a once in life time birthday. after all, how many times do you turn 28? (the answer is once).  oh, we had the 5-course menu. it's not worth the $400 (including 2 glasses of wine and an additional appetizer) i paid since the food was mediocre and unexciting (langostine was overcooked, sea urchin odd flavor combo, fish entress were not good- turbot was dry and fishy/ sea bass was okay, did not give us an option between cheese and sorbet, duck was soggy and plain, wagyu was tough and flavorless, choc soufflee had an odd texture (too much egg white?) and strange watery liquid on the bottom). my unbias opinion about the food is that you should take the $400 and go to Joel Rubuchon or L'Atelier instead if you're looking for french. but in the name of a complete rip off, just avoid this place altogether.  yes, the waiter/servers did try to make it up in the end, after i paid the bill, burst into tears, and told them you completely forgot it's my bf's bday. they came out with a plate of 5 bite sized desserts with the words \"happy birthday\" written on it and offered my bf a treasure chest box that are usually given to the girls. yay. that made it all up. and on the way out, when i asked the hostess what happened? she told me yes, she absolutely got the note and had mentioned it...she had no clue how they missed it. even more reassuring.",

The decor was very colorful, playful and with a touch of classico! The ristorante ospitante seated us at a beautiful table where we can see the waters of the Belaggio dancing to the music of Frank Sinatra and others alike.   We started our meal with a bottle and type of Rosso Sangiovese wine, which was delicate yet crisp.   Then came out our salads...Romaine Lettuce, \"Bagna Cauda\" Dressing, Croutons, Parmesan Cheese (Insalata Romana in Bagna Cauda, Crostoni, Parmigiano Reggiano)--served with assorted Italian breads.   For our main courses, I order the Rack of Lamb Crusted in Pecorino and Thyme, Mamma Egi's Peperonata (Carre di Agnello in Crosta di Pecorino e Timo con la Peperonata di Mamma Egi).  The lamb had a savory aroma, tender and delicious in taste.  While my boyfriend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin, Melted Gorgonzola Cheese, Crushed Yukon Gold Potatoes, Asparagus Wrapped in Prosciutto, Red Wine Garlic Sauce (Filetto di Manzo Grigliato, Gorgonzola Fusa, Salsa di Vino Rosso all'Aglio, Patate Schiacciate, Asparagi in Prosciutto).  This was a master piece of an Italian ambrosial dish!   Circo is definitely an inspired Homestyle Tuscan food that we enjoyed dining and spoiling ourselves for one night. Our fine dining experience was delicious, romantic and expensive.    (*please note that the description of our order was taken from the restaurant's menu, in order to remind myself of the classic taste of this fine restaurant)",

Was absolutely delicious.  Had the lobster salad as an app, my lovely date had the chilean sea bass, I had the rabbit. Exquisite dinner, deceptively filling. With a couple rounds of cocktails, the meals, the food... the bill came to $300 with tip. Cheaper than I thought it would be, so that was a nice surprise.

They have a few menus you can choose from. We went with the safe middle option - 5 courses, which was just the right amount of food. They also have a 10 course option, which in our experience of multi-course tasting menus means - roll us out the door. There was also an additional starter and dessert not on the menu, as well a mini plate of fruit gelees, macarons, and a delicious little pink thing which may or may not have been a marshmallow to finish. A smoked salmon with panna cotta, caviar, and gold leaf on top - and a watermelon granita with lime foam as a refreshing palate cleanser. I absolutely loved the chestnut veloute - the flavors were so intriguing. If he could, I'm sure SO would have licked some of his plates clean. We came purely for the chocolate ball, and it was a great visual experience. All in all, we were very happy and have been inspired to return home and try Le Cirque in New York. Hopefully it will live up to the experience we've had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Since the food in Vegas is marked up a gazillion percent, we decided that one nice meal out was all we could afford while in town. Le Cirque in the Bellagio was a wise choice. It was a perfect blend of fine dining and fun.   I started with the lobster salad which was phe-nom. We were told that people come here from all over JUST for this salad and I could see why. The beef tip that I ordered was good but a little dry... I had mistakenly approved medium well thinking that he had said medium, so that was probably more my fault than anything else. The best part of the meal was the dessert. I am a chocolate lava cake connoisseur and I have to say that the one I had here was the best I've had yet, even surpassing Shadowbrook's in Capitola (which is very hard to do)!   I will also note that I tried my friends truffle risotto, wow....if I had to do it over again I might have passed up the lobster salad and gone for this dish. It seemed almost impossible for something to taste so damn good.   The decor is festive and fun with a colorful circus theme. The service was impeccable and well timed the way it should be. My only complaint was that the server pulled out all the stops to sell this seasonal champagne cocktail that didn't do much for me; it tasted like any other effervescent drink and since he raved about it I expected greatness.   If you're in Vegas and have some money to spend on a nice dinner, this is a great choice.",

ATMOSPHERE: Festive, fun, but very high class and hoitty toitty.  The crowd was very conservative looking and everyone spoke at a whisper.     FOOD: Amazing! The salad was clean-tasting, perfectly seasoned, and the lobster was uber-fresh and perfectly cooked.  The filet mignon with foie gras was melt in your mouth delicious, even though I like my steaks cooked medium-well (I know, but get over it).  Finally, the pear souffle was cooked to perfection and tasted like silk!      PRICE: 98 clams for a three course prix-fixe is not bad considering the quality of the food, the pitch-perfect service and the fact that this is Vegas.  Their wine list was very comprehensive and quite impressive.  For those who don't care to spend $5K on a bottle of DRC, you can get a 750 of Papapietro Perry for about 100 bucks ... not too shabby.     SERVICE: Absolutely perfect! The maitre-d, server, sommelier, and bus-boys were attentive but not over-bearing.  The sommelier shared an interesting story about the paintings on the walls, and when I informed our server that they failed to remove the twine from my filet, they immediately took it back and brought out a re-plated entree.       CONCLUSION:  If you're in Vegas and you want to splurge a bit, I highly recommend Le Cirque.  The food ws great, but what sets this place apart is the impeccable service. Oh, and the little truffles they leave you with (in the cool red boxes) are a really nice touch!",

My aunt turned 90, you know it's a big one, we made a reservation and asked for the special cake(of course we verified the price and everything) they couldn't find a damn cake for a while. I saw a hostess writing it down, \"party of 10 with chocolate bday cake\" when we got there, she asked us back, \"oh did it write it down? Oh we are sorry, we can't find it right now\" what the hell. It was frustrating, they could find the cake for a while. And then the waiter spilt water on my uncle. To top it off, there's no garnish or anything on your food, if you order piece of meat, that's all you are gonna get. And my aunt, she loves lamb, that's why we picked here and we confirmed before that they had lamb, but on her birthday, when we got there, they said there was no lamb that day, it's seasonal item. Again, it's her 90th birthday, how often does that come? That was the whole point, lamb and the cake for her. They really need to do something about their service. We spent more than a grand in there, and they almost ruined my aunts birthday. God what a disaster.",

The staff immediately spoke to me in my native French (as if I was just there the day before) and spoiled me with a little extra of my favorite delicacies (gougeres and toasted brioche). The foie gras au torchon is one of the best I've ever had, the lobster was great and our chocolate souffles were decorated especially for our 1st wedding anniversary.  The fact that the food is perfect is one thing, but it feels amazingly good to go back to such a friendly place. Whenever we are in Vegas, we know that Le Cirque will always be part of the trip.",

Its better than the New York location which is very good as well but Las Vegas takes it up a notch.  Great experience and a must visit for anyone looking for a great restaurant with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  A tough call between this or Guy Savoy for best French in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Hands down the fanciest restaurant I've ever been to.  The quality and freshness of the food is amazing and the service can't be beat.  My favorite dish here is the sea urchin risotto (I've never had anything like it and it's probably one of my favorite dishes of all time).  Do not order it al dente/ask them to cook it a little longer if you're not a fan of pasta on the harder side.  The desserts are delicious (I tried the creme brulee) and they even give the ladies a box of 2 chocolates at the end and some sampler treats.  The bartender was awesome.  Although there was a limited specialty cocktail menu, he went to the kitchen to find fruits to make me a mango mojito which tasted amazing (I saw him taste-test it himself before serving it to me).  The rest of the staff were very knowledgeable (the head waiter told us he spoke 5 languages fluently) and the ambiance is romantic/classy.  The only reason I could not give Le Cirque 5 stars is because of the very high price ($250/couple) and wait time (we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated although we had reservations and there were not that many tables filled... I have a feeling they waited for us to order drinks at the bar before seating us...)",

The food was edible but not great. The tables were too close together, and they sat a large group with very loud guests next to us. The time between courses (tasting menu) was inconsistent, with some long waits. We did not get what we paid for by far. Had we known this going in, we would have gone elsewhere. The best item was the souffle, everything else did not live up to the reputation of Le Cirque. We will never come back. Overpriced and underwhelmed. We would rather have eaten at In-n-Out for our Valentines Day meal.",

    "text": "My most vivid memories of Vegas are as a child. My parents, though not formally diagnosed as compulsive gamblers, liked Las Vegas... a lot. We'd make the 6 hour drive from Salt Lake City to Vegas 4 or 5 times a year.  I've spent some interesting holidays in Vegas as a kid, some highlights off the top of my head:  - Age 14, buying a chocolate milkshake at the Burger King in the food court of the MGM Casino.  I was alone. - Age 10, 12, 15, Thanksgiving dinner at the Stardust Buffet (RIP) - Age 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc... Trolling the midway arcade at Circus Circus with a pocket full o' quarters.  Aaaah, the memories sweep over me like a wave.  God I was pathetic!!! Now that I'm older and have more than a roll of quarters in my pockets (remember, size doesn't matter), my Vegas experience is vastly different.  The main difference is that wifey won't let me go cheap here because she's a wallflowery princess.  In the spirit of living high off the hog, we dine at Nevada's branch of the famous New York institution, Le Cirque.  In short, it's good.  But I have a problem with circus themes, the clowns give me nightmares.  The other problem is that when you tell people you dined at Le Cirque, most assume it's the one in NY.  Definitely less snob-appeal.  But I guess if you're in Vegas, edgy sophistication is pretty much thrown out the door.  Eat the foie, play the slots, and stay away from the creepy clowns!",

    "text": "The atmosphere is fantastic at Le Cirque. The town is such a busy place and when you walk in it is as if you are somewhere else. It's beautiful, quiet, and the staff are incredible. I must admit I am not a veteran of the high dining scene, I have merely dipped my toes a few times. The staff are masters of their craft and the service was polite, informative, genuine, and funny. I cannot applaud them enough.   I went with a couple of friends of mine and I ordered a vodka cocktail and the five course menu. Regrettably I forgot the ingredients of the cocktail but I believe it's name is the Le Solitaire and it was pleasant.   First course was the yellowtail with heart of palm and a nice vinaigrette. The fish was silky, not the slightest bit fishy and in every way exceeded expectations. Obviously the plating was amazing as well.   Second course was foie gras with buckwheat and a st. Germaine sauce. It was decadent and fatty and just hit on all levels.  Between courses the chef sent us a complimentary bite to try. I remember it was incredible but regretfully I only remember some of the ingredients. I believe it was a foam/carrot sort of thing, amazing and appreciated though.   Third course was a scallop with a coconut Thai sauce. I must admit I am not a fan of scallops but I took a risk on this. It was fresh, the sauce was yummy, and the plating was very cool. Overall though I wish I traded it out for something else, the best scallop on earth is simply not for me, and this was a fun way to learn that haha.   Fourth course was the Kobe beef with a nice bordelaise sauce, oxtail in a potato cylinder of sorts and a fine mushroom. best steak I've ever had....best sauce too! The oxtail was also divine.   Then the waiter brought us a palate cleanser. A sort of orb of juice that was very welcome after the heavier dishes.   Last was the chocolate ball desert. A ice cream ball made of chocolate hazelnut that they melt with hot chocolate. Addicting and soooo tasty!   Overall an amazing experience, the staff is flawless, it truly is a top notch resturant that everyone should try.",

The captain had extremely condescending attitude that bordered on being rude.  The sommelier was the worst I have ever experienced and rude to top it off.  As a couple, we enjoy traveling to wine regions around the world and look forward to interacting with professionals in the field.  For my second wine, a Patz and Hall Pinot from Sonoma coast was poured.  I asked if it was from a particular vineyard and with attitude he attempted to educate me that patz and hall WAS the vineyard.  As a frequent consumer of Sonoma coast Pinot I kindly corrected him that patz and hall is the winery and not the vineyard.  The attitude, rudeness, and lack of knowledge was unacceptable.  I'm not sure if it was because we ordered the pre theatre menu but we were very limited on time and thought it would be a good way to try the restaurant.  The amuse Bouche was good.  The first course we both had lobster risotto which was ok but was nothing compared to the lobster risotto at Wynn lakeside.  Second course we had the chicken and sea bass.  Chicken was lukewarm and subpar but due to time limitation we didn't send it back.  Sea bass was supposed to be one of the flagship dishes and I would give it 4/10.  Desserts were excellent as was our waiter but this is not a restaurant we would recommend to any foodie.",

Just irresponsible and want to experience the finer things in life that you can't afford?  Well if any of these is the case, why not enjoy a nice dinner at a Michelin Star rated restaurant in the Bellagio.    As you can imagine, service was over the top fantastic.  We probably had 7 people serving us.  One was an expert on the bread, there's a sommelier for the wine, a food guy, etc.  You get my point.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.    Ok ok, I'll get to the good stuff.....THE FOOD!  We did the chef's tasting menu and EVERYTHING was delicious.  We YOLO'd and added the A5 Kobe Japanese Waygu beef.....BEST DECISION we made in Vegas that weekend.  I've been lucky enough to have it a few times at other places and this was ONE OF THE BEST!   Overall for the quality of the food, taste, and presentation it was worth the price.  Just be careful if you're a drinker, the bill could add up pretty fast (see photos).  Speaking of drinks, they have a great wine selection and really unique and creative cocktails.    PRO TIP: Ask to sit by the window so you can see Bellagio's fountain show.",

They located on first floor in the casino area and once you walked into the restaurant the ambience and the vibe was amazing. I felt like I was being treated very respectful and courteous during the time I was here. Service and food was incredible. I opted for the Degustation 5 course menu and I'm glad I did. Everything was perfectly cooked and once you finished a course you will look forward what comes next! Everything from the bread all the way to dessert were phenomenal. It is an experience I would never forget and would recommend and come back here 100%. Oh and the view to the Bellagio fountain right in front of you was the icing on the cake.",

If you are having dinner here and having one of those tables next to the window, when the fountain in front of Bellagio is on, the view is spectacular. Some of the waiters here have been in Vegas since 50\"s and they have some pretty incredible stories. Everyone is incredibly professional but at the same time really friendly. Truly incredible french cuisine. Every single dish was done to perfection and we had great dinner experience. The best Dover sole I ever had.  Fantastic selection of wines. Definitely one of my favorite French restaurants in Vegas.",

There was someone constantly waiting on us, whether it be filling our wine or adding more bread to the table or talking to us. The decor is simply marvelous. It is a fine dining place but not uptight and snobbish. They have a full bar too in case you have a long wait. It is inside Bellagio and they promptly ask you if you need to be somewhere (e.g. Shows) later. Accordingly they take orders all together etc.  The amuse bouche was salmon tartare on something I don't remember but it was delectable. We chose a Napa Chardonnay and loved it :)  For appetizers we had the avocado and lobster salad, burgundy snails (that were de-shelled), and the yellowtail. Everything was perfect. What I mean when I say perfect is that no flavor was overpowering but it was the right amount!  Three of us took the Colorado lamb that was perfectly made medium rare. The meat was juicy and tender and went beautifully with the lamb jus and buttered vegetables. One of us took the fish (did not get to try, she devoured it and said it was too good to share).  Before we could order dessert our waiter told us he ordered one of each kind from their pastry chef as compliments of the restaurant. The creme brulee was classic and the sugar level was just right. The melting chocolate ball was done perfectly too. The raspberry yogurt something and other stuff was good too. I should have written them all done.  We had an amazing time here and I'm definitely going back!!  He also gave us little souvenirs with truffles in them. I received a thank you email too after a day. Now how many fine restaurants do that :))  A year later I got a card saying congratulations on your anniversary. Very overwhelmed!",

Even if I try to think about anything negative to say ..nothing comes to mind. This is a dining EXPERIENCE. From the drinks at the bar to the service to just everything. The staff will make you feel special from the moment you come in, If you came to Vegas on a Budget ..this may not be for you... but we totally think for the quality of the food and service it was worth every single penny..and really.. not that expensive.  We did the 5 course dinner with the wine pairing. Every single thing I put in my mouth was like an explosion of flavors.   I stared with the Yellowtail.. with such an amazing flavor.. The Risotto was amazing. Then the Mediterranean sea bass... O M G ... the flavors were just an explosion inside my mouth.  The person who brought us the Jidori Chicken after told us that it was going to be the best chicken I would ever have in my life...  I'm telling you.. he was not kidding.  Also... TRUST your sommelier...  Frederic .. he will really surprise you with the choices.  This dinner experience was just an amazing experience ..especially when Rod Stuart is seated on the next table  ... :-)  I was so excited.   Listen.. a Restaurant can have the best food, but when you have the best staff and awesome Management that says a lot. Definitely reflects on the service. We can't wait to come back and enjoy it all over again.  THANK YOU ALL FOR A WONDERFUL DINNER EXPERIENCE.",

    "text": "Traditional New York high-dining in a fabulous Vegas space and a few flashy circus tricks along the way. I had a wonderful dinner when Marc Poidevin was the chef. I had another wonderful dinner with Wilfred Bergerhausen heading the kitchen. Regardless of who is in the kitchen, sticking with the signature Le Cirque dishes ensures a memorable evening.  The specialty cocktails were all martinis in outrageously tall glasses. Like most martinis, they weren't particularly unique like the \"Deja vu\" with Hendrick's gin, muddled cucumbers, and St. Germain which felt like deja vu because I've had this combination before at other bars. Despite the common cocktails, the show began with the amuse of smoked salmon on a smoldering bed of dry ice.  For appetizers, the lightly seared whole foie gras was big and rare. The lightest Thai flavors were creatively used to counter the fatty foie. The frog lollipops starter had cute leg bones used as the lollipop sticks. Acid from the mild bearnaise wisely balanced the fry coating on the frog meat ball. For added decadence, sauteed fiddleheads, whole morels, and white asparagus were added.  For entrees, the \"Rabbit Symphony\" was a duo of tender roulade and braised meat. The fried spaetzle added textural crunch and a buttery sauce tied everything together. The potato crusted fish was an upscale presentation of fish, chips, and slaw. The potato crust was thinner than expected which only made the dish more elegant along with increasing the scale of difficulty because it must be challenging to both cook the potato and fish at the same rate. It was also daring to use a red wine sauce with the moist bass.  The signature \"Chocolate Ball\" dessert was another showy dish as the hot chocolate sauce made the chocolate ball shell vanish. It was more showmanship than tasty as it would have been better with a darker chocolate sauce. Ultimately, it was too much like a chocolate sundae. The raspberry souffle had incredible height and a perfectly browned top. Again, the faultless execution topped the taste.  The wine pairings were on the mark except when both entrees were served with a Bethel Heights, Willamette Valley, Pinot Noir which smelled wonderful, but laid a little flat with the food.  Although jackets are recommended, it's Vegas and they'll seat any True high roller in just about any attire.",

The dining room was smaller that I thought it would be and the space had an intimate feel. It wasn't loud and it was nice to be able to hear each other talk. The atmosphere was more elegant and less flashy than I expected from a Vegas restaurant. We went on a Tuesday night and the guests were anywhere between their 30s to 80s. I was wearing a bit of a Vegas-y dress and there was I moment I wished I had worn something slightly more modest, or at least had thrown a jacket on over my dress. My husband wore a sport coat, button down shirt, and dressy khakis.   I had the lobster avocado salad, the sole (comes with sauteed veggies), an Edelweiss drink, and the chocolate sphere for dessert. I loved all of it. My husband had the lobster avocado salad, the chicken, a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and the chocolate souffle (big serving!) and he also really enjoyed his meal. We were also crazy about their chocolate coffee bread. It was random but so good!   Overall we had a wonderful time and we hope to visit again!",

    "text": "Le Cirque is situated in Bellagio with an excellent view of the famous water fountain.  The restaurant is small, but every aspect of it makes it high class and sophisticated.  Even the servers wear suits and wait on you hand and foot.  When I got up in the middle of the meal, someone automatically directed me towards the restroom without having me ask.  Walking in the restaurant gives you a circus feel.  The colorful fabric on the walls and circus murals create a fun and entertaining ambiance.  The cute monkey plates they give you added a nice touch as well.   So many starter breads to start out with.  Le Cirque never leaves out the details.  Even the butter had a cute design with \"Le Cirque\" stamped on it.  We opted for the 3 course meal.  They start you off with an amuse bouche which consisted of a puffed cheese pastry and some creamy soup.  The pastry was fluffy and buttery.  The soup which tasted like some sort of chowder was a great start to the meal.    For the appetizer, we had the lobster salad and foie gras au torchon.  The lobster salad consisted of a fresh whole lobster tail with house dressing.  The small citric taste of the dressing helped to balance the refreshing greens of the dish.  The foie gras was not the greatest I've had.  It had a stronger taste which didn't balance well with the sweetness of the strawberry compote.  It wasn't as smooth and creamy as some other foie gras I've had.  We had a blanquette de lapin (rabbit) and chilean sea bass for the main course.  Both came highly recommended by the staff.  The rabbit was tender and full of flavor.  The presentation was unique.  The foamed sauce surrounded the rabbit and ravioli.  The sea bass was the best part of the meal.  The best way to describe it was AMAZING!!.  The meat was flaky, but not too bouncy.  Each of the threads of the fish could be separated as it melted in my mouth.  It was accompanied by two citric vinaigrette reductions: orange and lemon, which added a sweet and tangy taste to the fish.  This is a definite must-try for any fish or simply food lover without a deathly allergy reaction to fish.  The meal ended on a sweet sensation.  We had a chocolate sphere and chocolate souffle.  The sphere reminded me of a giant Rocher chocolate .  It comes with a warm chocolate that was poured over the sphere and opened it revealing the rich milk chocolate in the center.  It was a great show. There was even an edible gold foil on top.  This dessert was just chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate!  Great for the chocolate lover like myself.  The warm cream poured on the souffle created a nice contrast to the cold vanilla bean ice cream.  Another must for the chocolate lover.  The portions at first seemed small, but with the added bonuses, I was really full at the end.  After a delectable meal, go see the awesome Cirque du Soleil show: O, which is just next door.  Come here to get a taste of high class Vegas!  This restaurant which with a Michelin star is rightfully earned.",

    "text": "Best dining experience I've ever had.  Granted, I don't frequently enjoy fine dining but have had my share, especially in Vegas.  My previous best meal EVER was at SPAGO Beverly Hills, but this exceeded that in both food and service quality.  Compared to Picasso, Michael Mina, Bradley Ogden (no longer at Caesar's?), Mesa Grill, Fleur, Le Cirque bested them all in food quality, taste, and service.  My wife and I both tried selections from the Degustation Menu (5 courses) and they did not disappoint.  Foie Gras and burgundy escargot were delicious.  Lobster salad was better than Spago's - much more lobster in the salad.  Sea food selections - sea bass and scallop - were dead on delicious.  I had experienced very \"gamey\" venison at other places (Picasso, for one) but this was gratifying.  Since it was the end of the seasonal menu, the chef included black truffles onto my wife's organic chicken, which was super succulent and juicy.  Only problem - we didn't have enough room to finish our desserts.  Chocolate sphere and chocolate souffle.  Both rich and devilishly smooth, but not overly sweet.  We really were treated to the quality of the chocolate, and not a huge sugar-rush taste.  Everyone involved with the service was fantastic, from the lead waiter to the support staff.  They were fun, charming, yet sophisticated while warm.  My wife and I felt like they really wanted you to enjoy the dining experience.",

    "text": "In a word, disappointing.   This should be a one star review for the service, but since the drinks were very nice, they get two (one for each Michelin star...what a joke).  My boyfriend and I were very excited to dine here after having read so many excellent reviews and since we began dining at Michelin star restaurants monthly (a New Year's resolution, of sorts).   I had made a 6:00 reservation and was hoping to order the highly Yelp recommended pre-theatre menu, since we were seeing a 9:00 show. I called to let them know we were running late and we arrived at 6:10. They had us wait five minutes at the bar, even though, when they walked us into the dining room, it was 50% full and seemed laughably overstaffed (so many people standing around with nothing to do, almost in the way).  The decor was nice but it seemed much more extravagant in the pictures. The dining room is surprisingly small, quiet, and brightly lit. We significantly brought down the average age of the diners and I believe we were judged immediately for not being over 60.  We were greeted with menus, 5 minutes after we sat down, and ordered two cocktails. I can't remember the names of the drinks but I believe both had St. Germain in them. I inquired about the pre-theater menu and was told almost immediately that it was no longer available after 6:00*, even though their own menu cites otherwise. At this point, it was 6:25 and I asked our server if it was possible to make an exception since we had a 6:00 reservation and had arrived at 6:10. He told me he'd see what he could do and I was naively optimistic, considering I've worked in fine dining for years and understand that a guest's happiness is the only priority.   Another person promptly came by to tell us that we could not order the pre-theater menu because the kitchen had already packed up all of the items on it. This seemed like a pathetic excuse, considering most of the items on that menu were now on the regular pre-fixe menu for twice as much money.   I was annoyed, to say the least. I informed our server that in lieu of the pre-theater menu no longer being available, we would just take the check for our drinks and dine elsewhere. As we waited for the check, I was told that we could sit at the bar and order off of an a la carte menu. At this point, I was visibly upset and didn't care to give this uppity restaurant our business. We signed the check and I left a tip that I'd normally be embarrassed about, but in this case, it felt deservingly appropriate.   If only we were treated differently, I could be writing a 5 star review like everyone else on Yelp. I'm sure the food is fantastic, but when I go out to eat, the service weighs heavily on my dining experience.   We ended up dining at Fix, also in the Bellagio, and I plan to write an excellent review about their food and service. We ended up spending over $300 at Fix, in case anyone reading this misjudges my disappointment for frugality, in the way that Le Cirque did.   I have no problem paying for great food and even better service. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see either at Le Cirque.  *From Le Cirque: \"The (pre-theatre) menu is available from 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM\"",

It is still quite generous, with choices for each of the three courses. We had to make a request to have this menu delivered in addition to the regular more expensive menu. This is literally the only thing that wasn't done perfectly. What an intimate, beautiful place, looking out on the Bellagio lake. Service was professional and warm. Freddy was all you could ask for in a sommelier, informed and fun to talk to. My risotto and my wife's salad were excellent, as was the wine pairing. We both got sea bass as our main course. I'd never had it prepared this way and I have never had it better. The chocolate ball is a fun dessert, a little sweet for my taste but not for my wife and it was scrumptious. And the port pairing was spot on again. In between were the most clever amuse bouche's, little mouth explosions. The beautiful parting sweets was the final classy touch from this classiest of restaurants. We should have come sooner and we won't miss it on our next trip.",

    "text": "Ah - Le Cirque! So famous yet so cheesy. The decor is hilarious in this upscale delicious place. I'm sorry, but eating in a circus tent with flying colors and crazy rainbow stripes all over the place is a little much. I get it - it's a circus, (for the love of God, themed design AGAIN) but why not use decor that reflects a different aspect of the circus, how about caged animals? I think that might make more sense.   So - the food was fabulous here dahrling....just as you'd expect it to be. The best part of the night? The Sommelier telling us funny stories about high rollers drinking $4k shots of liquor mixed with diet coke and $80 ice cubes. Yes, ask for a special sphere ice cube made with distilled water so it appears completely clear, if you dare....  Don't come here thinking you'll get a bargain, it is pricey and it is tasty as well. I never expect anything less of a place that carries a huge name and following. If you want something less then go somewhere else, you are playing the game when you enter Le Cirque, dress yourself up, suck it up and try to have a good time, this place is memorable and fun - and it's Vegas baby.",

    "text": "So what if Pete Wells demoted the New York original down to one star? Maybe it deserved it. And so what if the Las Vegas outpost has been open for more than a decade? One thing is for sure, this place does not clown around when it comes to fine dining. In what is perhaps one of my best food experiences in this town, Le Cirque combines the elegance and refinement of the Big Apple with the seductive theatricality of Sin City.  We opted for the Degustation Menu with Premium Pairing. At $135 and $88 respectively, the meal is pricier than Picasso but certainly not as much as Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon. With tax and tip, expect to pay around $275 per person.  Dinner started with a cold amuse of New Zealand mussel with Catalan sauce and corn chowder. I typically do not like mussels because I find them too rubbery, but I have to say this was delicious. The sweetness of the corn paired nicely with the peppery tomato sauce.  For my first course I had the Santa Barbara sea urchin. Beautifully served in a ceramic sea urchin, which actually kind of looked like a candle votive (ha!), the urchin was transformed into an \"ice cream\" of sorts and then folded into a fennel puree and a ginger-lemongrass gelee. It was an extraordinary dish, one that presented my palate with flavors I have never tasted before. Paired with a NV Ruinart blanc de blanc, it was epiphanic!  The next course was sauteed Sonoma foie gras, served on a white chocolate and raisin brioche, with a honey glazed apricot, almond and cardamom tarte to the side. It's hard not to enjoy foie gras, especially one prepared as well as this one, but after the sea urchin, I felt I had tasted these flavors before, so I was not as impressed. This was paired with a 1929 Maury Pla del Fount.  The third course was my absolute favorite of the evening. It was a chorizo crusted Alaskan black cod, accompanied by a garlic brandade, piperade basque on the side, and squid ink sauce. Now this is why you come to Le Cirque! The sheer brilliance of this dish is that nearly every component was doubled -- the cod was doubled in the filet and brandade, the chorizo was both on top and inside the filet, and squid ink was used as a sauce and the dye for the brandade. Paired with a beautiful but ripe 2009 Patrice Rion Nuits Saint George, it stands as one of the top three fish dishes I have had in my life!  Our next course was a fascinating dish, one that required two days to make: bucatini timbale, Kobe beef oxtail, Perigord truffles, with daube sauce. When it arrived at the table, it looked like a little beehive, but it was actually a perfectly-lined up spiral of bucatini. It is only when I cut into the \"beehive\" that I saw the oxtail ragu inside. Simply amazing! I was buzzing with glee! And although I enjoyed the 2005 Chateau Rouget on its own, the sweetness of the meat and sauce made the wine taste bitter.  For my dessert I ordered the chocolate sphere, which housed a flurry of praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, and hazelnut caramel crunch, all bathed in chocolate sauce. It was more visually appealing than anything else, but I still enjoyed it. Unfortunately, this last dish was disastrously paired with a 2005 Le Tertre du Lys d'Or Sauternes. The sommelier should have known better than to pair chocolate with Sauternes; Port or Madeira should have been the obvious choice.  But the sheer deliciousness of our entire meal compelled me to overlook this blunder. The food was exquisite, the service was on point, and my experience at Le Cirque was simply outstanding!",

It's a small, cozy, personalized resturant, perfect for our pre-O Cirque Du Soleil Show. The waiters have been their since the resturant opened, are very respectful, caring and were congnisant of our show time. The french food was to die for, each meal coming at a perfect time, perfect portion and delicious options. Presentation is unique and magical. I had a dairy and gluten free preference, which they accommodated for very nicely, especially for a french resturant. The decor is elegant, yet fun upscale circus theme. You can see the Bellagio fountains from the window. We sat in a nice corner booth, and it was very comfortable. There's a fancy bathroom inside the resturant, which is very convenient. Le Cirque is a great romantic resturant or good for couples or small groups. We went for our anniversary and the staff made it very special with a cute little treat. Highly recommended resturant in Las Vegas!",

Drank them all like water.  It was fantastic.  3) Food - we ordered the pre-fix summer meal.  It was amazing.   - Foie Gras: I had it as an appetizer and I sampled my friends dish that had Foie Gras with steak.  I could have ate 5 of them!! - Lamb chop:  this was heaven.  Best tasting lamb chop I ever had, hands down. - Smoked salmon with caviar was wonderful - Yellowtail appetizer was amazingly delightful. - Lost in all of this was the sea bass wrapped in potato.  Amazingly well prepared, light, but yet so flavorful.  - My friend's dishes that were also great were caviar on crab, scallops, and chicken (which was just a bit dry) - Dessert: good, nothing spectacular, but still great presentation and good tasting.

The party next to us commented on all our choices and practically joined us for dinner.

    "text": "Simply.  Amazing.  Le Cirque is one of those culinary institutions with a well-deserved reputation for outstanding food and service.  I've wanted to try the flagship in Manhattan... but when I saw the reviews for the Vegas location, I decided to give it a try.  Located inside the posh & glamorous Bellagio hotel, the dining room at Le Cirque overlooks the famous fountain show.  Every fifteen minutes, the fountains come to life through the windows (set to the low-level ambient music of the restaurant instead of tunes you'd be hearing outside).  The decor is circus-themed but very tasteful and subtle.  No scary grinning clowns on the walls.  The tableware features cute little monkeys.  Even though I had no reservation, they took my name and seated me in the lounge for a pre-dinner cocktail... and then called me by name for the evening.  Very personal touch.  The staff were friendly and humorous, and it was easy to talk to them and ask questions during the meal.  I ordered the Degustation Menu, which was an exercise in dining etiquette.  I took a course several years ago about using the proper silverware during formal meals, but these dishes presented me with a number of challenges with silverware I've never even seen before.  Fortunately, the staff didn't comment when I used my salad fork to eat the oyster course.  Oops.  The courses were each exquisite in appearance and taste.  I started with the tiniest oyster and a dollop of caviar, which was creamy and delicious.  The opening lobster salad \"Le Cirque\" was a well-matched jumble of flavors, piled high in a cucumber shell.  The sauteed foie gras was perfectly cooked and seasoned - I've had foie that's over-salted, but this was amazing and the \"verjus\" sauce was rich and bold with unfamiliar but delicious flavor.  The paired pinot gris was so perfect and sweet that I asked the sommelier to give me the name of it - I will be looking for this wine as a staple at home.  Mmmm.  The paupiette of sea bass was really the dish I was most looking forward to, and it didn't disappoint.  This signature dish was just simply divine.  Sitting in Le Cirque, watching the fountains, sipping the same pinot noir that had been reduced to make the sauce... I just wanted to close my eyes and revel in this moment.  Heaven!  The next course was yuzu-glazed duck, and it was probably my least favorite dish of the menu - but it was still excellent.  This was a dish more traditional in flavor and tone.  Duck with citrus is tried and True, not very exciting, but this was well-executed.  At this point I was quite full (and also quite drunk from the wine pairing), and both anticipating and dreading the arrival of dessert.    The meal ended with pre-dessert (blood orange gelee and foam surrounding a rich pannacotta) and then a huge assortment of desserts.  I can see why they'd call this \"dessert fantasy\" - there were handmade petit fours, a gorgeous souffle with a strawberry cream sauce, and a spoon of tangy and perfect sorbet.  I tasted almost everything but didn't make it very far into the course before I was too full to consider another bite.  This made me sad - I wanted to finish it all!  But the waiter brought me a copy of the menu (so I could know the name of that fabulous pinot gris) and a cute little box with truffles inside.    Everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the staff, the service, the food, everything.  Given the price, I wouldn't want any disappointments.  The full tasting menu is $125... the standard wine pairing is $65... the signature champagne framboise appertif is $22... and the hot tea I requested with dessert is $4.50.  This is, by far, the most expensive meal I've ever eaten.  But I think it was worth every bite.  The experience filled two hours and I stumbled away into the night, happily sated in both body and soul.",

My order was the 2 fix course that offers Escargots as my appetizer and my main entree was scallop with fresh lobster tail layered with butter, pesto, a bit of spice, & more. Oh French cuisine, how you make my stomach twirl with butter so of course I subsided that with a glass of merlot and another.  My friends and I were very comfortable and overjoyed with how etiquette their service was. We were fortunate to have a chance to meet the kitchen crew including the head chief- p.s. they were all fine looking fellows  and men in the kitchen just makes this restaurant my number one rating of 2009.",

    "text": "My husband and I met our two friends from Australia for dinner at LeCirque.  The ambiance and decor are lovely and interesting and the many staff members with whom we interacted were all pleasant and professional.  Then came the food, which also was delicious and well prepared in every respect.  It would seem a 5 star review is in order.  The problem is what we have been dealing with after our visit to LeCirque.  First our friend, now back in AUS, contacted us to say he'd been billed twice on his credit card and asked us to check our bill.  At the restaurant we asked the server to split our check equally onto two credit cards.  Our friend had two charges for approx. $400 on his card and to our surprise our card also had been double billed with another two charges for $400.  Ok, seems easy enough to correct what could have been a simple error.  Not too easy, unfortunately, because multiple email and phone calls to the MGM and to LeCirque have gone  unanswered for one month now.  The only option for both of us was to dispute the charges with the AMEX Centurion desk and answer questions and waste our time.  I'm still wondering, you do so much so well, Le Cirque,  what is going on with your billings?",

They are deserved!! The food was delicious and the place very comfortable knowing that you are on the Strip.  I would have actually give them 5 stars if rating only the food. But the service was mediocre compared to the rest. The waiters were trying too hard to sell you the most expensive part of their menus. And the 2 French waiters were just purely annoying; being pretentious and anything but nice. True French waiters after all (I lived for many decades in France)!!",

Since dining at Le Cirque in October, I have also dined twice at what many people consider the greatest restaurant in the USA---Alinea.  I would rather dine at Le Cirque than Alinea. The service at Le Cirque is more friendly and seemed less rehearsed. The food that Chef Gregory creates is more sophisticated and flavorful. Grant(ed), the dining experience at Alinea is absolutely wonderful and it is almost like attending a theater performance. And there is nothing quite like having a meal at Alinea. As far as the food goes, I just prefer Le Cirque and Chef Gregory. During my dinner last Friday night, I especially loved the Santa Barbara sea urchin \"ice cream\", the bucatini timbale, and also the deconstructed bouillabaisse.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying my review is skewed by my disappointment with my waiter, which I will explain at the end.  Four of us went there for dinner--two couples. The room is nice, not noisy at all. The wait staff is attentive, without hovering all over you.  For starters, my wife and my friend had the lobster and avocado salad--just so-so, not a lot of flavor.  I had the escargot--they were good. My friend's wife had the lobster risotto--it was out of this world.  My friend and his wife had the dover sole; it was good, but definitely not Michael's (South Point), which is the gold standard. My wife had sea bass; it was ok. I had venison; it was outstanding. The three medallions were as tasty as any tenderloin, anywhere.  Three of us had chocolate souffle. It was really good. The chocolate ball was nothing special.  All in all, if you know what to order, you could have a fantastic meal. As for the waiter, I asked the maitre d to make sure I got the bill instead of my friend, and gave him my credit card, and told him to add 20%. When the bill came, it showed a total, nothing on the gratuity line, and nothing totaled. I assumed the tip had not been included and added 20%. When I got home I realized the bill was $525, they added $105 for a tip, for a total of $630. But when they brought the slip for me to sign, the waiter had left the tip space blank. I felt like I was tricked by a sneaky waiter who definitely did not deserve a double tip. I really expected to get a call from the restaurant telling me about the error.  I now feel the waiter knew exactly what he was doing, and intentionally tricked me. I would have given Le Cirque four stars, but feel the waiter's actions cut it in half.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Vegas for a week and wanted to  end our trip on a high note so we decided to come to Le Cirque on our final night. Everything was outstanding from the food, to the service, to the presentation of the meal. It was also our anniversary that week, and the staff really went out of their way to make us feel special.   My husband and I arrived and were warmly greeted by the hostess who said Happy Anniversary. Our waiter promptly came over to our table and also said Happy Anniversary. He was very friendly, helpful and thoughtful. He saw me taking photos of everything and volunteered to take our photo without me having to ask. He answered every question we had about the menu. My husband ordered this delicious drink in a big pineapple shaped copper Moscow mule type mug and it came with a macaroon on top. Someone comes over with 4 different kinds of bread for you to pick from. The coffee chocolate bread was to die for! I had seconds it was so good.   We went with the 3 course prix fixe menu. I ordered the Maryland blue crab with caviar,  the rabbit symphony, and the chocolate molten ball. I was hesitant about getting the crab because it was an extra $65 charge, but the couple next to me talked me into it by saying it was very good. Our waiter asked if I knew there was a supplemental charge before I ordered it, which I knew but I  appreciated it  because sometimes people don't catch everything that is written on the menu. I told my husband he should order the oxtail because it was something we didn't normally have, but he decided against it when our waiter told us it was a supplemental charge. That one I didn't catch, I thought it was only for the ribeye, so I am glad he told us before ordering it. My husband ordered the snails and lamb instead.   All our food was delicious. Our waiter even told us to have our camera ready to take a video of the crab when it came out when they poured the smoke over it, the presentation was amazing. I was expecting caviar to be really fishy but it was surprisingly not at all. It blended really well with the crab and avocado. My rabbit was very tender and flavorful as well. My chocolate mousse ball with hot  chocolate ganache poured over top of it was another great presentation as well that I got on video.   I decided I wanted to switch seats with my husband during the meal because I wanted to sit on the long sofa and not a chair and one of the workers was nice enough to give me a pillow  to sit on cause I was a little short for the table.   We got a copy of the menu signed Happy Anniversary from the executive chef. We also got a complimentary box of truffles and 2 plates of macaroons with some kind of gumdrop.  I also asked our server to take our picture again before we left and he did it without hesitation and until we were satisfied with our photos. Everyone here really went above and beyond to make our day special and we enjoyed the whole experience.",

    "text": "Vegetarian 5-course meal was disgraceful. Complete lack of creativity and taste. If it weren't for the good, meat-centered meals the other two had, I would have rated this restaurant a one. The service was good.  This was my 60th birthday. We were going to go back to Twist, however, I suggested we try another 5 star restaurant. Twist's vegetarian 5 course meal two years ago, was fabulous, as were their traditional meals. I wish I had agreed to go back to Twist.   In addition to the shameful quality and creativity of my meal, typically smaller courses were miniscule compared to the non-vegetarian selections. As expected, plates were removed from the table right away when done.   Most awful, having eaten the tiny amount of my food, I had to sit there with nothing in front of me and my hands in my lap while my brother and brother-in-law were enjoying the good portions of their excellent food. They were very full when we left. I was very hungry, and extremely disappointed.  My brother paid $ 880 for the three of us (including tip). I couldn't bear to tell him how unhappy I was with my 60th birthday dinner, and how hungry I still was.  If it weren't for the great Janet Jackson concert we went to see afterwards, my 60th birthday would have been quite a memorable bust for me.  In summary, if any one in your party chooses to eat a vegetarian meal, go to Twist instead of Le Cirque.",

Witty waiters, and attentive busboys were everywhere. I think we got serviced by 4 different people.   The timing of the courses was excellent. No awkward long waits between each finished course. The kitchen was nice enough to substitute one of the prefixe entree choices with the rabbit.  Presentation and flavors of the foods were on point. Delicious Lobster and corn bisque. I can go on about the food but I'm sure other reviewers can say it better than me. In the meantime, enjoy my pictures.",

    "text": "I finally returned after a nine-year hiatus.  I'd been wondering all this time if a second dinner experience would live up to that magical first time in 2008. To recap, Le Cirque was my first ever Michelin-starred dinner (back when Las Vegas published a guide). Since then, I've experienced others and now have a better point of reference of what should be expected. I'm happy to say that it's still an excellent restaurant despite Michelin's departure.   We were a group of four. I wouldn't initially describe the decor as timeless, but the whimsical and showy look has stood the test of time. Upon checking in, the hostess happily welcomed me back and pointed out to me the many staff members who still worked there.   Once at the table, service began and spotlessly continued throughout. We spoke to the sommelier at length about the type of wines we like and our desired price range. We also mentioned we wanted to learn more about French varietals. As expected, he chose the perfect bottle for us.     WHAT WE TRIED:  Citrus Risotto St- Germain Flambeed Foie Gras Burgundy Snails Potato Crusted Mediterranean Sea-Bass Diver Scallops Colorado Lamb Classic Creme Brulee Chocolate Ball  We all chose items from the 3 Course Prix-Fixe Menu. In addition, Le Cirque provided complimentary courses; started with an amuse bouche (a custard inside an eggshell), received a palate cleanser before dessert (a fun candy shell that popped easily to reveal a sweet liquid interior), and ended with mignardise treats (macarons and marshmallows). I enjoyed every dish I tried. Presentation style varied per dish: some more innovative than others. The highlight dish for me was the foie gras. The tapioca and sesame added an unexpected crispness to the silky yet firm consistency. The sweetness of the St-Germain and elderflower syrup complemented the dish nicely. I loved the presentation of the seabass. A thick layer of potato wrapped around the fish stabilizing it and making it simple to scoop all of the flavorful ingredients in one swift move.   There were a couple of misses. Unfortunately, my girlfriend didn't enjoy her scallops and only ate one of the three served. I can't recall why she didn't mention it while there; I'm sure they would have offered to remedy the situation. Lastly, I thought the creme brulee didn't quite fit in given its dated simplicity (although I did enjoy the cheeky plating). Then again, it IS listed as a \"classic\"...so I suppose we were warned?   Chef Wilfried Bergerhausen brings a skilled hand to Le Cirque. While the menu still lists classic dishes, it's nice to see the newer ones added. The key here is just how flawlessly and successfully both the work together. Overall, I enjoyed my second visit and recommend adding it to your bucket list if you haven't yet tried it.   P.S. The purse holders are still there...and I still have my original one.",

    "text": "Wow. Where do I begin? First and foremost, the reputation this Vegas icon has achieved through the years is more than well-deserved.  My girlfriend and I dined there last week before going to the 7 pm showing of \"O\", and as a result, had to choose between the pre theater and prix fixe menu. Girlfriend liked the pre theater options better, so we decided and off to the races!  To start we had a Myvegas credit for the house champagne, which was delightful and crisp with the appetizers. I got the foie gras, my girlfriend the English pea risotto. While the risotto was creamy, decadent, and delicious, the foie gras stole the show. They used a brandy made from Normandy, France, that really brought the dish around. Every bite was spectacular, and I could easily have done several courses on this alone.  For main dishes we did the beef tenderloin and Chilean sea bass. The sea bass was wrapped in a crisp potato layer that was just the right texture and consistency to not overpower the fish. The beef was simply the best non-wagyu cut of meat I've ever had. (My girlfriend let me try hers). Even the potatoes mousseline that accompanied the beef were to die for. We didn't want to be too drowsy for the show, so we skipped wine pairing and had a cocktail with the desserts, which again were almost too pretty to eat! I thought I was going to be all about the chocolate ball, but the strawberry parfait was so refreshing and sweet after all the rich fare that it took top honors for me.  As for service, there's a reason this place has a Michelin star and Forbes 5 Diamond. Old world service, attentive without being intrusive, non judgemental and no attitude about doing the pre theater menu, no attitude about the free credit, and of course beyond knowledgeable about the menu options. Our table was lead by Daniel, along with a host of servers refilling water, wiping away crumbs, offering more bread, all while feeling invisible, which I found especially impressive given the small size of the restaurant. To top it off, a view of the fountains only to be surpassed by the likes of Lago and Picasso. My heartfelt thanks to Daniel and the Le Cirque team for making even a brief dinner a memorable one.",

    "text": "Made a reservation for myself on 8/4, showed up on time, and ordered the 5-course meal.  Was seated at bar where it was the bartender's first night and spent the entire 3 hours cringing as the poor bartender got non-stop berated and insulted by snobby waiters who refused to show a shred of patience for him adjusting to a new place. What an excruciating experience to blow $250 on.  On top of it, they made the bartender - who was already overwhelmed and knew nothing about the food - serve my dishes. He couldn't explain them and didn't know to notify the kitchen to start the next meal, causing extraordinarily long wait times.  Occasionally the manager and other staff would ask if I'm ok, but the last thing I'm going to do is throw the poor bartender (who's in earshot) under the bus for something that's not his fault. I felt trapped in an unbearable situation as a result of management failing to train staff before putting them on the floor.  Soon, every seat at the bar was taken but there was an awkward silence among the patrons as the waiters continued to verbally harass the bartender. I couldn't wait to leave, but tipped the bartender like crazy.  Music was bland and tacky. Food was passable, but hardly deserving of the price. Only 1 or 2 dishes flirted with that delectable umani found in properly constructed dishes. Combined with the nightmare environment, it's now one of the worst dining experiences of my life.",

The dress code is jacket is recommended for men but not required, but no sport shirts or shorts.  The ambiance is amazing with the cirque ceilings. The servers are very attentive, polite and friendly. Our food was great but the highlight was the foie gras and the braised cheek. You got to take a video for the chocolate ball when they pour the hot choclate over it to melt and also the smoke of the blur crab plate. They actually asked us to take a picture of these stuff, so don't be shy to do it. It is the most expensive restaurant, I have been to. Expect to pay around $500 and up ( food and drink)",

Each member of the staff was attentive to our every need. The small touches, from edible gold on the caviar to the warm chocolate melting the ice cream of the hazelnut ball, made it exceptional. We absolutely recommend Le Cirque for a special night in Las Vegas.",

We had the 10 course Prestige tasting option and every course was over the top good. It's small plates so you don't need to worry about not being able to finish 10 courses. It had everything from lobster to scallops to quail.   The service here is impeccable and the entire staff made me feel very special.

It's like they're all paying attention to you.  This type of customer service should be followed by other restaurants.  Everyone from the Host to the Busboy, are so pleasant and professional.  We came in 3 weeks ago for our anniversary.  They had our table set with the Happy Anniversary note.  It's a little thing but makes one feel special.  We had delicious Martinis but unfortunately, lost my receipt and can't recall the names.  They were both delicious!  The meal began with palette cleansing gelatinous starter.  There were several breads to pick from.  I'm not a bread person but my husband loved bread! Even I loved my bread with bacon and cheese.    We ordered... Lobster Salad Hamachi Salad Rolled Seabass (we both had that) Chocolate ball with Hazelnut middle Red Velvet with creamy cheese  I can't say enough about how fantastic our meal was.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared!  My mouth is watering thinking about the delicious concoctions they prepared.  The plating was beautiful and my dessert was a piece of art!!!  Literal piece of art! Looking forward to coming back on our next trip to Vegas.  In the end, they offered complimentary sweets while we handled the bill.    If you're looking for a great place to celebrate a special occasion or a nice dinner, this is absolutely the place for it!  The restaurant is intimate and the service is amazing!   It's a must try in Vegas!",

The service is the best, and the restaurant is beautiful and colorful. There is a lot to choose from on the menu. Everything is great. The appetizers are so wonderful and all the mains are great. The salads are also lovely, but at the price I would skip them. They have an excellent wine list.  Le Cirque is near the fountains so you may be seated where you can see them, maybe not, but all the seats are very good. It is very expensive so expect to spend over $300.00 for two people. It is worth it. Enjoy.",

    "text": "YUMMY! Does that count as a sufficient review? :-P  Ok probably not right?  Anyway we (ok I ...) decided when were first planning our trip to Las Vegas that I wanted to try Le Cirque.  So we made reservations on OpenTable a few weeks before our trip.  We ended up getting to the Bellagio earlier than I excepted (probably because I decided against walking over from the Venetian in heels) so we stopped by the Hyde (see other review) fro some pre-dinner drinks before heading over to Le Cirque.  Once we arrived we were seated in the lounge/bar area to wait on being seated at our table (again, read: got there early).  We were quickly taken care of and our coats checked so that we weren't carrying them around with us.  After a few minutes of getting my drink in the lounge we were escorted to our table.  Bear in mind if you come here reservations are awesome and the dining area isn't very large - definitely an intimate setting for sure.  (be aware if you are seated near people who speak loud or speak loud people sitting around CAN and likely will eavesdrop).   Service was definitely exceptional - everything was refilled and cleared promptly; nothing was overlooked!  Now for the food...OMG the food...We decided before arriving (maybe more like 2 weeks before...) the DEGUSTATION menu and it was divine.  The courses were 1.  Japanese yellowtail & Parsnip Veloute 2. Carnaroli Risotto 3. Mediterranean Sea Bass 4. Braised Veal Cheeks & Roasted Organic Chicken 5. Grand Mariner Souffle and Chocolate Souffle  Not to mention the amazing bread, amuse bouche, palette cleanser, and the assortment of french macaroons.   Dinner was phenomenal,  everything tasted amazing and my favorite thing by far was the exceptional Grand Mariner Souffle!!  Definitely a great place for date night in Vegas (if you are willing to spend the money)!  A word of warning - it does look like a circus inside (duh! Le Cirque) and that was hard for my man to reconcile with an amazing high end restaurant.",

My main issue was that the supplemental dishes (that cost us 150% more than the original pre-fixe bill) were not great - in some instances, not even good. The crab and caviar was bland. For that kind of money, dont hide the delicate flavor of crab in mayo. It lost its sweetness. The Langoustine was fishy and the sauce was too rich and tasted strange. The Wagyu beef ($100 supplement) was not good at all - tough and flavorless. Our server was outstanding. it's one of those places you might be intimidated to go to, but dont be. Despite the seeming air of pretension, the staff is affable and accessible. They didn't take themselves too seriously. Despite my criticisms, the majority of our food was outstanding.

    "text": "Excellent dining experience at Le Cirque. I ordered the Pre Theater menu ($72) with wine pairing ($40.)   Le Cirque lived up to my expectations. The staff were friendly, swift, courteous, and well informed.  The meal began with an amuse bouche of an acidic lemony foam with, beneath, a savoury carrot puree. The flavors were forcefully challenging yet very well balanced. Excellent way to start the meal with a thougtful bite from the kitchen to get me thinking.  The bread was very good. I've had fresher bread at other fine dining restaurants, but the flavors were nonetheless well balanced and the crumb soft enough. I appreciated the juxtaposition of salted and unsalted butter on the same plate, preferring the salted variety. The choices of bread were varied and consistent with other fine dining restaurants  No surprises for the bread course.  The escargot had a plump bite with just enough chew to give it body and allow mouth time for the sauce flavors to meld in the palate. I found the sauce a bit too bitter and leafy for the relative medium softness of the butter/something bitter in there sauce. The sauce of the dish was a bit gloopy for my tastes and had a bit of a xanthan gum mouthfeel. The chablis wine pairing was crisp and sweet, a complement to the bittery dish.  The potato-crusted black bass over braised leeks was so good. Though the bass seemed a bit dehydrated/overexecuted (cooked maybe to 137f instead of 131f) the dishes flavors were outstanding. The savoury potato and fresh firm fish were lavished by the soft yet complex slight acidity of the leeks and buttery pinot noir sauce. The dish naturally paired well with pinot noir, which was an element lightly accented within the dish.  For dessert I chose the chocolate ball. The waiter pours hot sauce over it at the table which mesmerizingly melts away the chocolate exterior. This dish is bitter and sweet with dark chocolate crust, hazelnut notes, and a crunchy, toffee like crush interspersing smooth ice cream. The port wine paired well with its syrupy deep sweetness and oaky complexity.  The final bites were hazelnut and raspberry macaroons with a Pate de Fruit. All was soft and freshly fruity.  Le Cirque made me feel at home. It took me away from the garish facade that is the Vegas casino. They present an authentic and intelligent fine dining experience amidst the gambling harpies of vegas hotel conglomerates.",

The decor of Le Cirque is intimate and cozy.  Not a big fan of the old circus paintings and the colors personally but you do get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains from here.    Service here is outstanding all-around.  Great stories from the waiters; explanations of all the dishes; constant checks of water to supplies.  No problems.    The menu is a prix-fixe menu of different sorts (most of them are +$100).  A few of the options also have extra costs affixed.  The one I chose was with an appetizer/entree/dessert.  They also have a cocktail menu (and wine/beer) ranging from $16+.  For the cocktail, I received the deja vu which is gin with cucumber flavors - pretty good and love the presentation/cocktail shaker. You also get bread (lots of flavors) and salted/unsalted butter.  We also got a seafood amuse-bouche which was pretty interesting and even had some gold on it.    For the appetizer, I got the risotto which came with lobster.  It was pretty good although the texture was a little strange with the nuts and fruit-like food involved.  I then got the sea bass which came in an egg roll shape.  I thought the presentation was interesting but the taste was fairly not that special here with the salty/vinegar-y sauce and the egg roll style dominating the flavors too much.  Finally, I got the pistachio dessert - the bar which wasn't too shabby with good flavor profiles.  The included buttermilk ice cream though was tasteless in my experience.  We also got some small desserts for free but I was told the flavors weren't that special here.  Most of these dishes had that similar deconstructed feel as well which all looked interesting/cool but the flavors always were a bit all over the [lace.    Le Cirque isn't bad by any means in terms of the quality of service or experience.  Just the food I felt wasn't completely connecting taste-wise with the creativity behind the dishes.",

When you to Le Cirque the food is good the service is great but their is one component  that brings the experience to a whole different dining level...  The sommelier, Fredrick did the most amazing wine service we have ever experienced. Go for the food stay for the wine!   He is a master storyteller, showman and and overall master of ceremony. He brought our dining experience to such a level that the dinner truly became an experience for us.  Skip circus de soleil \"O\" in Bellagio and go to Le Cirque instead, because they put on a show that just as good, but tastier.",

The bus boy and the chef who came to our table to explain our Stages was EXCELLENT and we thoroughly enjoyed him. We spent  $900 for 5 people which I do NOT mind and expected.

    "text": "Le Cirque reminds me of my teenage years, when I had to go to the Bible study retreats. I've never felt so out of place other than those times. I thought to myself afterwards: so this must be what it feels like to be a Democrat in a room full of Republicans...  After months of research and comparison, needless to say, I was exultant over my Christmas day/Anniversary dinner reservation with Le Cirque. I was looking forward to this decadent dinner for months even prior to my arrival to Las Vegas.   When this evening finally arrived, I practically was skipping all the way from my room in Cosmopolitan to Bellagio. Upon arrival, the hostess told us that they're prepping our table for us, I thought to myself: Yes, just like what I requested over the phone, they're seating us at the table with a nice view of the Bellagio fountain (which was suggested to me when I mentioned this will be a third year anniversary dinner with my BF.) After 45 minutes of waiting and two cocktails (during which time we had a fantastic time with the gentleman who was attending the bar,) we were finally seated. Our table was two rows away from the window seats, while there were other empty window seats that were left unoccupied.   Don't get me wrong, the food and the services were beyond amazing. We had the pleasure of ordering out of the entire Christmas Day tasting menu (since there were two options from each category.) Somehow, I still felt strangely awkward. I enjoyed dishes such as Le Cirque's famous lobster & avocado salad, creamy risotto with alba white truffles, Japanese A5 wagyu kobe beef, and of course, the chocolate ball.  It wasn't until I left the restaurant, I realized no one had mentioned anything about my 3-year anniversary with my BF. We didn't get any of those treatments that people raved about when they decided to come to Le Cirque to celebrate their relationships' milestone. My BF on the other hand, had a wonderful experience. I guess in the end that's all it mattered. But, if someone asks: would I go back to Le Cirque again the next time I'm in Vegas? Probably not. I had a better dining experience at Alize and Eiffle Tower.",

Unfortunately I suffered a ruptured Achilles and was in a cast and bound to a knee wheelie post surgery. My wife and I still kept the reservation and made the dinner since it was her birthday. My wife was dressed in a wonderful gown and I had a tie, sweater and dress shorts since I couldn't fit slacks over the thick cast. Much to my surprise the manager rudely turned my wife and I away stating that my shorts were unacceptable.  Mind you other patrons were wearing cargo pants and t shirts.  Hardly attire that I would rank above ours.  This was a clear instance of discrimination.

Surprisingly not too pricy either for such a high rated restaurant. 3 course was $105 a person, 5 course $135 and 10 course $350. We did the 3 course and the food was abundant enough. In addition to the 3 course selections, they also brought out a selection of bread, duck confit, macarons and sweets, and pumpkin ice cream in between each course. Our server was delightful, all who have apparently been there for 20+ years. Martin, who I am assuming to be the show master at Le Cirque, took our orders and held consistent conversations and table touches with each party in the intimate dining room under the colorful carnival themed draperies. He's f****n awesome to say the least. For two people and a gross total of under $440 which includes two alcoholic beverages, two 3-course meals with a Wagyu $100+ add on, two coffees, and gratuity, our Le Cirque experience was indefinitely worth more than what we paid for. I am looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of their menu.",

The servers were total pro's, so gracious, charismatic and attentive without being intrusive.

    "text": "I've dined at least a half dozen times at Le Cirque (it is my favorite LV restaurant).  Nothing, however, could have prepared me for THE most luxurious meal I have ever had. The staff, and especially the GM, Ivo Angelov, have always made sure that when I dine at Le Cirque I am treated like a queen.   When I arrived Tuesday evening, I was again greeted warmly by Ivo. I was led to a corner banquette that would have comfortably seated 4 or 5 people. I told Ivo that I was interested in having some white truffles. I was not given a menu, but started receiving dishes that I would have ordered. Before the parade of luxury, I was presented with a beautiful assortment of breads. I chose the pretzel, the bacon cheddar, and the white chocolate walnut--all were delicious.  My first course was the trio of caviar: smoked salmon rillette wth vodka cream; capellini with poached quail egg, shiso, lemon vinaigrette; kumomoto oyster, Granny Smith Apple, lemon verbena mousse. The dish is presented, and a liquid is poured and smoke rises from the plate (very dramatic!).  Next course was the Fall Salad of baby artichokes, avocado, foie gras snow, jamon iberico, Parmesan, Dijon mustard vinaigrette, and shaved white truffles.  I was thrilled with the next course: gnocchi with white truffles. The best gnocchi anywhere, and with the addition of the white truffles, this dish became my favorite dish of 2014!  Next course was the chilled beet veloute, goat cheese panna cotta, micro greens, and crostini. I'm not a big fan of beets, but this course made me a convert.  This was followed with the seared diver scallop, potato and Apple brunoise, white truffles, celeriac puree, lobster foam, and white chocolate sauce. Didn't think this would all work, but it did beautifully!  My main course was the Japanese A5 Wagyu kobe striploin, bone marrow fondant, spinach puree, beef tendon croquette, royal trumpet mushrooms and bordelaise sauce. Oh yes, more white truffles! I wound up having beef at each of my dinners, but the best was at Le Cirque.  The pre-dessert was a mojito granite with lime foam-very refreshing.  I specifically requested the souffle for dessert since I have long considered the souffle at Le Cirque to be the \"gold standard\". The flavor was raspberry-yuzu; I tasted mostly raspberry, and it was delicious!  A tray of mignardises followed, and I ate everyone of them. The last treat was the jewelry box with 2 truffles. I ate only one of them.  Service was, as always, wonderful! It's great to see many of the same staff. Even those staff members not taking care of my table came over to say hello.  When I requested my check, my captain came back with no check, and said my dinner was with the compliments of Le Cirque. I was blown away by such kindness. I left a very generous gratuity for the staff.  Even if I had paid for the dinner, I would still rank it among my top 5 all-time favorite meals.",

Worth mentioning: Foie gras with kaifer lime and coconut. It sounds a bit odd but the flavor profiles were bold and extremely complimentary to each other. This dish stood out and definitely gives you an idea of the chef's skill at integrating such random ingredients to make such a palatable dish.  White truffle gnocchi.  Who doesn't like truffle with pasta?  This dish was so rich, creamy, and just melt in your mouth delicious.  I highly recommend Le Cirque; its the perfect restaurant for any occasion! ;)",

    "text": "When wining and dining (perhaps even winning?) alongside a spectacular windowsill view of the waterworks fountain show at the Bellagio, overhearing a pair moments before that just proposing, one could not help but take a step back, pinch one's own arm and ask, \"Am I dreaming?\"  But then, I saw there were mushrooms-a-plenty via truffles on the menu, so I knew it was not a dream. While fungi do not float my boat, all would still be fine, because options in Le Cirque's Degustation Prefixed menu with wine pairings permitted me (mostly) to select other more palatable items.  The soup for my Amuse Bouche was flavored like a corn succotash (it tasted similarly in a later dish). Chilled and good.  Next one was already my favorite -- their Osetra Caviar Trio! Included Smoked Salmon Rillette with Vodka Cream; Capellini with Poached Quail Egg, Shiso, Lemon Vinaigrette; Kumamoto Oyster, Granny Smith Apple, Lemon Verbena Mousse. A dramatic liquid nitrogen effect occurred as cold vapors rose through pores under the plate, encompassing the dish for several minutes before dissolving away. The delicate smoked salmon tasted scrumptious!  Here's where the succotash returns from earlier... The Florida Frog Legs included Potato Gnocchi, Corn Succotash, Parmesan, Lardons, Broccolini, Micro Mizuna. My second time trying frog legs ever, this was a much more flavorful version and the only caveat was how quickly it ceased as I consumed this quickly. Frog legs were similar to chicken in texture but distinctive enough to be recognized as their own thing -- try them here, if you get a chance.  Next up was the Atlantic Cod en Croute, Ratatouille, Kalamata Olives, Tomato Confit, Potato Pearls, Baby Octopus, Sauce Vierge. This was an okay item -- I did enjoy it and the octopus appealed to me -- it just didn't engage me like the previous dishes had.  My last main dish was their Organic Roasted Chicken, with Asparagus, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Roasted Baby Potatoes, Sauce Vin Jaune. Here's the one time I couldn't avoid le fungi... But their roasted chicken was quite good. May have been a bit heavy on using potatoes (let alone mushrooms), but it's all a matter of opinions.  Our Palette Cleanser: Lime flavored shaved ice. Very refreshing -- didn't think I could possibly have any room left but it didn't feel heavy to consume.  Le Cirque provided us with extremely knowledgeable service for both food and wine. Ultimately, our reservation coming here was during a quick getaway weekend, and it became the nicest part of a fantastic evening we'll never forget.",

From Ivo, to our server Thomas, to the staff member Javier. The only time I had such service was when we had lunch at the Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tour in Paris, France.  The food, I cannot find the words to describe it. Just imagine a symphony of flavors playing in your mouth and the aromas playing with your senses!!!  The cost for the dinner was well worth it. I think we found our new favorite restaurant in Vegas. We will surely become repeat patrons.",

    "text": "What a wonderful dining experience we had at Le Cirque.  You are taken care of the moment you walk in the door.  The most attentive staff, delicious food, elegant and upscale decor.  My husband and I were quite impressed and would definitely go back for another go at some point in the future.  The meal started off with this delicious amuse bouche - a chilled corn chowder.  I didn't think I'd want to eat a cold soup, but this was divine.  First course was my absolute favorite.  Chose the seasonal risotto, which currently it was topped with shaved white truffle.  HEAVENLY.  The risotto was perfectly creamy, the truffle decadent and rich.  I wanted to eat it all, but knew I had more food coming and most definitely didn't want to get too full too fast.  Sadly I had to give them a 2/3 empty bowl back, and my heart literally broke.  My husband loooooooves foie gras, so I knew before he opened his mouth he was about to order the seared foie gras.  All he kept saying throughout the course was this was how foie gras was supposed to taste.  I'm pretty sure that meant he approved.  Second course was the Maine Lobster.  This came in the form of lobster tail, lobster cake and a couple of lobster claws.  Accompanied by a mushroom and squash side.  I didn't eat much of the side - not because it wasn't good but because it didn't excite me like the lobster did.  You know, saving room and all that.  The lobster cake was like a crab cake and was very savory.  I did like the tail, but I wasn't over the moon with it like I was the risotto.  But let's face it: how hard is it to top a 5-star risotto?  Very.  Hubby got the wagyu beef with bone marrow fondant.  We didn't talk much during this course.  He cleaned his plate.  That's enough evidence for me.  Last course was the roasted pineapple/white chocolate mousse/mango sorbet thing.  It was the perfect ending.  Not too rich - the tart sweetness of the pineapple balanced out the creamy mousse.  An excellent blend of flavors.  My husband had the chocolate Grand Marnier souffle, which he thought was spectacular.  Surprisingly, I didn't make myself miserable with food and walked away regretful that someone in the kitchen was in possession of the rest of my risotto.  Ah well.  It was definitely a meal to remember, that's for sure.",

I think if I may dare say, had the best meal ever at Le Cirque but it may have been the beautiful French accents from our wait staff and the view of the Bellagio fountain right next to me that was doing the trick... From the minute we entered this restaurant, I knew we were up for an amazing experience.  The level of attention you receive from the host, bartender, sommelier, manager, and waiter all at once is overwhelming yet flattering.  I loved their accents...My friend and I honestly couldn't get enough.  We chose the Tasting menu with the premier wine pairings. Amazing combinations, one by one explained to us in detail by the lovely sommerlier.  Some of my favorites of the night was the lobster salad.. a must try! fois gras was the best I've ever had...perfectly done, and the risotto! AMAZING...the sea bass which was paired with a Red surprised me but I later found out that it was because the sea bass is cooked in Pinor Noir sauce...AH.... i wanna go back! The damage was done after having our last course, the Souffle! chocolate souffle!  Had a bite and we were done...not because it wasn't good but our stomachs were maxed out...i think a box of biscottis packed in elegant le cirque boxes were a nice touch!  The bill came out to be just under $800 for the two of us...I know crazy... we did drink alot and besides Bellagio comped for all our meals...can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "We had reservations at 5:30 but were running late as usual so I called them up and asked for it to be changed to 6:30, no problem, but she couldn't secure the window seating for us any longer, not their fault. We arrived a few minutes early and was told to have a seat while they prepare our table. Within minutes we were whisked away to a corner booth. Not the window seats I desired but it would do. I don't understand why they cover up the large windows with panels when the fountains are right in front of them. All 3 of us had the 3 course menu for $98 per person, it comes with an appetizer, main course and dessert. We were still really full from our late lunch. I had the lobster salad, the beef tenderloin with foie gras and the chocolate sphere for desert. The other two with me had the truffle and lobster risotto, seared foie gras, venison, creme brule and crepes. Every single dish was wonderful. My lobster salad surprised me with huge chunks of lobster, they don't skimp out on it here! My beef tenderloin was the most tender beef I have ever had, it melted in my mouth and the foie gras was fatty wonderful goodness. The other two were enjoying their venison until they had a taste of my beef. They didn't want to go back to their plate! I barely put a dent in my food so they packed it up for me and I enjoyed some of it at 3 am. I wish I was hungry enough to eat it all, such a waste of delicous...and expensive food. The bacon bread is also my favorite! My dessert came out as this chocolate ball and than the server poured hot chocolate on it melting the top and exposing all the lusciousness laying inside, very good! The creme brule and crepes were also fantastic. The portions here are fairly large for this type of place. The servers are also very very nice and attentive and not stuck up at all. We will definitely be coming back for round 2, 3, 4....!!!",

    "text": "Our party decided to do the degustation menu. Here is what I think... First course, Lobster salad, there was nothing not to like when it came to the bright clean and refreshing flavor but when you bite into the lobster the only thing that came to mind is chewy and rubbery as if it were boiled/poached way too long.  Next course, the much anticipated foie gras which sadly came cold and rather under cooked with a texture that was flat, lumpy and fleshy. Despite that the paring of the spiced bread and asian pear was terrific and unique. The bass was surprisingly my favorite course, it was everything you want a fish dish to be. Light bursting with delicate flavor yet subtle enough to not over power the fish itself. Although I would have imagined the paupiette to be crisp it was more soggy and soaked through, yet again another dish where taste over ruled texture. My main course the glazed duck came remarkably short of expectation by any standard. Again it came very cold (not even warm) lacking all flavor and texture. There seemed to be no balance in this dish. I was confused on whether or not the skin was supposed to have been crispy but got stale or was just stale. It was most likely cooked to the perfect med-rare and could have been amazing right off the line.  My assumption is because of the lack of enough waitstaff the dish was probably sitting for too long before being served. Here the desserts very much out shone the rest of dinner. If I had to go back I would make this place a stop after dinner just for dessert and drinks in the bar area. The souffle was probably the best I've ever had . It was impossibly airy and light, total perfection! The gigantic chocolate ball reminded me of a ferrero rocher de-ca-dent! On to service... As noted earlier there seemed to be an obvious lack in enough wait staff. They were courteous and not over bearing yet, they seemed unrelaxed and somewhat stressed and frantic. Ambience was interestingly enough a bit disheveled but fun with a circus tent atmosphere. We also did the wine paring which put our bill for two well over $400 making the value to service to food to ambience ratio much lower for a restaurant doting a reputation of such a high calibre. In the end with all the amazing places Las Vegas has to offer its a wonder how they can remain on the forefront of so many \"best-of\" lists. Great place to eat once just to say that you did. Good luck on your dining adventures!",

    "text": "We wish we could recall everyone's name. Daniel was our main \"assistant\" - we've decided to call him this because saying he was our \"waiter\" doesn't do him or his skills justice. He was utterly professional, personable, pleasant, not over-solicitous, and was terribly impressive. The Sommelier was personable, appropriately humorous, informative and very helpful. Everyone was wonderful. The food was not only beautifully and creatively presented but it was just amazing. If we didn't like something not an eye was batted; off it went to be changed. The desserts were outstanding, clever, and generous (as were all the servings). Overall, the best dining experience we've had anywhere, but particularly in Las Vegas. As for price: on average this is a $200-$300 meal for 2.  This isn't something we can do everyday mind you, but it was so worth it! If you want an amazing meal with THE best service you will EVER have, you need to make a reservation here.We were THRILLED to pay what we did for the gourmet delicacies and service we received at Le Cirque, and cannot stress enough how well worth a evening here is - this is not a \"meal\", it is an event.  You simply cannot go wrong with anything on this menu from start to finish, or with any of the staff. Brilliant! We cannot wait to come back, nor can we recommend this work of art and the professionalism of their staff enough. 5 stars.",

    "text": "We just went here for dessert, after dinner at Lavo, but what a spectacular, classy experience it was. They close at 10, I believe, but when we walked in around 11 and asked if they could seat us for dessert, they said, \"Absolutely.\" Walking into the circus themed dining room, with dark wood panels and windows overlooking Lake Bellagio, you almost forget you're in Vegas...that is, until the Bellagio fountains show begins. I can only judge the food from my one dessert and the little dessert sampler they bring out with it, but if all the food is as good as these items, then Le Cirque rightfully deserves to be one of the top 10 restaurants on the Strip. Our dessert (I can't remember the name) was a marvelous creation of strawberries, creme, and streussel in an egg shaped bowl made out of ice and floating on a bowl of pink-colored ice chips. And the dessert sampler they brought out with it (always a classy touch) was just as wonderful. Service here is as fine as anywhere in Vegas - the staff is the definition of restaurant professionalism. When you leave, they give you little boxes to take home with little drawers that pull out, each holding a truffle candy. These small, classy touches, top-notch service, and extraordinary cuisine (from what I can tell by the little we had) truly validate Le Cirque's AAA Five Diamond rating.",

    "text": "Now, I rarely ever write mediocre 3 Star reviews, but in my honest opinion, my tepid experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. With that said, here's the rundown of what transpired on the evening of July 4th... After reading rave reviews from friends and fellow Yelpers, i decided to choose Le Cirque to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The restaurant was bustling when we arrived. We were seated towards the back which was upsetting since I requested a window seat months in advance. A few tables were still vacant by the window, which I found puzzling. Moments later those same seats were filled with other patrons, same number of guests mind you, that came after us. Not a good start so far.   Granted the place was busy, it's no excuse for the waiter to make us feel rushed. He seemed hurried and not warm yet he was quite efficient at taking our orders and whisking away in a flash.  He clumsily scattered our silverware on the table like we were dining at Denny's. Wait, even at Denny's our utensils are placed with more care than this jumbled mess.  We all went with the degustation menu at 135$ per person and the birthday boy went with the 88$ additional wine pairing, as well. With a bottle of French Pinot Gris on the table, we were good to go.  The breads weren't warm, but room temperature and very chewy.  I went with the onion bacon and pretzel. The pretzel was salty and too tough to eat and the onion bacon was hard and practically indelible.   Thankfully, our amuse bouche was a refreshing bite sized cucumber wrapped creme fraiche treat that awakened my palate perfectly.   The first course was incredible.  It was a delicate langoustine osetra caviar carpaccio with crisp sliced green apples that simply made my taste buds pop at first bite. The contrasting textures and flavors went from tart to tangy to sweet and spectacular. A splendid first course.  Here's where it gets bad, again. The time period between the first and second course went from lengthy to uncomfortably long. Luckily I was in good company and we had pleasant conversation that helped pass the time but the extensive wait (30 minutes) was inexcusable. We inquired with our server and he quickly rushed into the kitchen without responding to us. Moments later, our dishes came out from one of the support staff that appeared agitated and rushed, as well. What was going on here? There was plenty of staff standing around, yet the same few guys were running frantically around the small restaurant. Strange.   The scallops were supple, buttery and exhibited an excellent mouthfeel.  The foie gras was magnificent. The combination with the sweet plump cherries was genius.  The fresh black truffle risotto was a huge disappointment, however. The risotto was undercooked and hard, which is not the consistency a good risotto should feel like. The only saving grace were the finely sliced black truffles sprinkled on top, that left a subtle yet heavenly aroma to this mediocre dish. At an additional 40$ supplement to the 135$ per person tasting menu, I expected better. I would have sent it back but refrained in fear of an even longer and more excruciating wait time.  The third courses were far more redeeming with the beautifully crusted cod that tasted like butter in my mouth and the sea bass that was simply heavenly The John Dory was good but paled in comparison to the complex flavor profiles of the other two mind blowing dishes.   The fourth dishes were fantastic, too. Namely the Kobe. It was literally melt in your mouth delicious. It came at an additional 65$ premium but it was well worth it. Divine in every way!  The duck was supple and the flesh was smooth and velvety soft.   The rabbit was tasty but I couldn't help but feel it tasted like chicken.  The pre-dessert was bright and whimsical. A tequila lime sorbet with fresh grapefruit and poprocks was inventive, surprising, refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser  In regards to dessert, don't skip it. You would be making a huge mistake. With that said, you've gotta try the souffles here. They are perfect pillows of paradise in every bite. The chocolate was enticing but the vanilla grand marnier was irresistible! The ice sculpture berry sorbet dessert was inventive and incredibly refreshing, as well.  My friend received a birthday selection of mignardises and the ladies were presented with truffles neatly presented in Cartier inspired jewelry boxes.   Thankfully the night ended on a positive note but in all honesty, for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected far more consistency in service than the inattentive and sloppy half-baked excuse for service we got last night. If it weren't for some of the incredibly amazing dishes, I would have given this place one star for the poor service alone.  If I were you, check out Picasso in the same hotel. They offer beautiful views, delicious five star quality dining coupled with exceptional service.  Happy Eats!",

Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, so we ordered some drinks and took a seat at the bar. Upon entering the dinning room, we could see that the space was small and intimate, overlooking the lake and fountains.   The waiters here are nothing short of exceptional, both friendly and helpful. My wife wasn't too crazy about the choices for one of the 5 courses, so our waiter was able to offer up a different alternative that was agreeable. One of the things that I Truely appreciated was that the waiters took the time as each dish was served to explain what each dish was and how it was plated. Far too often I read a menu description only to be uncertain as to what's on the plate that has been put in front of me.   As for the food - simply mahvelous!  While the portions may be considered small, we both felt completely satisfied with our dinners. The chocolate ball for dessert was a real standout.   Overall, Le Cirque  was an excellent choice to celebrate my milestone birthday. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

And we returned this year, one month before we get married to enjoy another fabulous meal. We tried the 5 course degustation menu with the wine pairings. We each got a different item from the menu to get a taste of everything. Make sure you save room for their amazing desserts! Our server was so nice when we explained we were getting married next month and here celebrating with friends, he brought out a different dessert for each of us to try! If you get a chance to chime to Vegas and you're looking for an amazing place you eat, come visit Le Cirque!!",

    "text": "I was surprised by how bad the experience was at Le Cirque. A lot of the wait staff were very nice, but not quite coordinated and smooth enough to make up for terrible drinks and lackluster food.   My expectations were high based on reviews I'd read and raised by the hostess' confirmation call earlier in the afternoon when she took information about our restrictions, but those notes were not passed on to the wait staff prior to our being seated. For instance, I couldn't eat the amuse-bouche due to my dietary restrictions.  I'm unable to drink alcohol and I usually stick to sparkling water, but I thought that a place like Le Cirque could come up with a creative mocktail (I've had great ones at great restaurants before and Le Cirque advertises their mocktail as \"startle me\" on the menu so they certainly suggest that they can make one). In response to the waiter asking about my drink preferences, I said that I like drinks on the drier side, not too sweet, and I don't like the flavor of licorice. What I got tasted a lot like a tequila sunrise with club soda instead of tequila (aka juice, very sweet!). I didn't drink it and when the waiter next came by he noticed and asked, I explained it was too sweet and he whisked or away to correct it, which I appreciated. But what they brought back was basically the same drink but on the rocks. This one had pineapple juice in it (aka it was sweeter, just cold this time). I didn't drink it again and he comped it on the bill, but needless to say it did not inspire confidence and left a bad taste in my mouth.   The two things I enjoyed during the meal were the lobster avocado salad (delicious, bright and refreshing) and the pre-dessert which was something like cocoa butter balls wrapped around a watermelon and yuzu liquid (they burst against the heat of your tongue and it was a really neat texture and experience).  The bread was forgettable and they kept pushing it throughout the meal, which stuck me as odd for such a high-end place. The lamb entree was ok, but fairly one note (strange considering it was lamb prepared three ways) and very heavy (it needed something other than sorrels on the plate to brighten it up). The desserts were bland and not served well: the creme brulee was too set in texture; the chocolate ball was a huge disappointment (the chocolate poured over it was not hot enough to melt the ball the way it is supposed to and the server, as he was pouring it out, noted that it wasn't having the effect that he liked but didn't do anything about it.. Which I thought was weird. He should have replaced it with a properly prepared dish since he noticed and commented on it). They showered us with macaroons and other little desserts, some of which were good but at that point we both just wanted to get out of there and laugh/cringe over the experience (and oh my god the money! We have no problem paying well for great food but this was not that).   We still had a great night, it's hard not to in Vegas, and laughed a ton during our meal but our first comments upon leaving Le Cirque were in awe of how disappointing it managed to be.",

    "text": "Whimsical, intimate, and vibrant environment and decor. Fun, personable, and knowledgeable wait staff. Exquisite food with lovely wine pairings. These are the reasons why Le Cirque is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. This was our second visit, and although not the best night to sit down for a three course tasting meal (we had just arrived from the East coast and metabolism was at 11 PM in that time zone), we soon forgot it was our bed time.  You can't hep but have fun here. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable, yes. But, what I like is the exuberance and friendliness of this restaurant. I enjoy good food, but an evening is sometimes dampened with too much stuffiness. Not here!   I started with the lobster and avocado salad and followed it with the \"symphony\" of rabbit paired with spatlese on the side. The chef's sauce for this dish had me wanting to lick the bowl. Julia Child would be jealous. The spatlese was a miss for me- not reminiscent of the German kind; it was bland and dry, and it didn't add anything to the rabbit. The wine pairings were wonderful: sauvignon blanc from Loire Valley for the salad, a pinot noir from Oregon, and a nice ice wine for the souffle'.  We ordered chocolate souffles ahead of time for our desserts. Incredible!  Just when you think the evening can't get better, you are handed a lovely small box that looks like a jewelry case. Inside are two perfectly shaped bon bons. We saved these and had them for dessert five nights later after we arrived home. We're still savoring the occasion.  Not an everyday restaurant and I hope they keep it special. I do suggest given the size of the place that they limit the parties they seat to 6-8. Large groups tend to be loud and dominate the service. Still, far better than Piccasso and much more welcoming than Andre's. Go early and request a table by the window overlooking the bellagio fountains.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. This is one of the few restaurants on the Strip that, in my humble opinion, is not overrated. In a nutshell, you will enjoy a fine dining experience with exceptional service. We came here to Bellagio to enjoy a nicer dinner before watching 'O' and I really had my doubts. But as the night rolled along, the high ratings were justified more and more. The food: We had the Prix-Fixe Menu. Started with Steak Tartare, and Japanese Yellowtail. The quail egg added a nice bit of extra flavor to the Tartare, and I love what this place did with Yuzu sauce for the Yellowtail.  For our main dishes, we got the Spring Colorado Lamb, and the Rabbit Symphony. We decided we wanted to try different things, so that's what we got. The Rabbit was exceptional! I'm absolutely sure that there are many people who cannot bring themselves to eat rabbit for whatever reason, but it was absolutely delectable!  Lastly for our desserts, we got the Chocolate Ball, and the Chocolate Souffle. The chocolate ball reminded me of a dessert that I had at Sweets Raku over in Chinatown. Very interesting to watch it melt in front of you.  The Prix-Fixe Menu is about $105 per person.  The service was over the top! We had multiple servers who were all very knowledgeable about the food (especially the alcohol) and they seem to be very passionate about what they are serving. It made the evening extra fun. I personally hate sleepy restaurants, so I definitely enjoyed this type of environment.  So why not a perfect 5 stars? We made reservations for 7:30pm and arrived at 7:10pm. So we were asked to sit at the bar or come back closer to our reservation time. We sat at the bar until 7:30, but still were not seated. It didn't look that busy, but we still kept waiting. We finally sat down around 7:50pm. Of course, this isn't some quick eating place, and we need some time to eat here, but we did feel a little rushed because we had to catch our 9:30 showing of 'O' which we were recommended to arrive by 9:15. We ended up making the show on time, but if we weren't seated 20 minutes late, we would have had plenty of time and not felt rushed to enjoy our delicious dinner. Overall, I highly recommend this place, even if you are a local. Yes, we generally hate going to the Strip, but this is one place to go to especially if you want to take out of town guests someplace nice.",

New executive chef Wilfried Bergerhausen, he's talented, young, handsome and simply awesome. I met him at Michael Mina Bellagio last year. He was nice, genuine and talented. I knew it wouldn't be long before he could be an executive chef of some amazing restaurant.     Chef Bergerhausen was the executive sous chef at Michael Mina at the Bellagio before he came to the Michelin Star Le Cirque. He replaces chef Paul Lee. Chef Bergerhausen worked at Joel Robuchon for almost 5 years, as well as L'Oasis in Mandelieu La Napoule, France. He was an assistant chef at Bocuse D'or, the worldwide cooking competition, with chef  Eric Finon, competed in Paris.       Experience the timeless sensation created by charismatic Restaurateur, Sirio Maccioni. The rarity of Le Cirque's AAA Five Diamond rating speaks eloquently of French cuisine - exquisite, bold, transcendent. Immerse yourself in a jubilant showing of brilliant color adorning this famed lakeside destination designed by Adam D. Tihany. The moment you walk in, you will feel this luxurious feel, elegantly designed, a bit bold, bright, but grande, it feels as I walk in a chateau, I feel royalty, I feel special and the service from the moment we walk in till we left, it was perfect in every single way.       We got lucky the wonderful GM Ivo Angelov got us a corner booth table which is my favorite with the lake view of the Bellagio, priceless, with my client Apple iTunes department, I was here for CES 2015. I couldn't be happier.  - Seafood platter - oysters, hamachi, lobster, stone crab, caviar - umm umm goodness!   - FOIE GRAS, COCONUT FINANCIER, TAPIOCA PEARLS, THAI BASIL , KEFIR LIME SAUCE - Foie Gras for days!   - WINTER SALSIFY AND POTATO SOUP, SOFT POACHED FARM EGG, PERIGORD BLACK TRUFFLES, PAIN DE SEIGLE - I die happy with this soup alone!   - BURGUNDY SNAILS IN GARLIC HERB BUTTER, CROUTONS,CONFIT TOMATO, PARMA PROSCIUTTO - a classic French dish and a must order.  - SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS, POTATO AND APPLE BRUNOISE, ALBA WHITE TRUFFLES, CELERIAC PUREE, LOBSTER FOAM, WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE - perfectly seared to perfection.   - RABBIT SYMPHONY: BRAISED LEG, RAVIOLI, ROASTED LOIN, CRISPY SPATZLE, FAVA BEANS, RIESLING CREAM SAUCE - this was amazing, 3 ways rabbit  - ATLANTIC COD EN CROUTE, RATATOUILLE, KALAMATA OLIVES,TOMATO CONFIT, POTATO PEARLS, BABY OCTOPUS, SAUCE VIERGE  - Le Contre-Filet de Buf Wagyu Japonais JAPANESE A5 WAGYU KOBE BEEF STRIPLOIN, BONE MARROW FONDANT, SPINACH PUREE, BEEF TENDON CROQUETTE, ROYAL TRUMPET MUSHROOMS, BORDELAISE SAUCE - stunningly delicious, melt in your mouth happiness.   - For 2, WHOLE ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCK, CARAMELIZED ENDIVE, FAVA BEAN PUREE,MAITAKE MUSHROOM, FOIE GRAS, DUCK CONFIT AND POTATO GNOCCHI POT-AU-FEU, SAUCE A L'ORANGE - this was perfectly cooked, so generous portion.

My clients were every happy, my best friend loves everything and so did I. The 70 seats Le Cirque was packed every night since chef is on board. This Le Cirque under chef Wilfried is a 2 Michelin Stars in the making. I can't wait to come back.      The wine list is impressive and the sommelier is so wonderful here. He helped us to choose the perfect wines to pair with our dinner. My group was very happy with the choice.      If you want to celebrate your BDAY, anniversary, a promotion, or just because you are loved, Le Cirque Bellagio is a perfect place for you. And tell GM Ivo that you hear this from me :-) You will thank me later :-) Enjoy!",

    "text": "This is my friend's favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. She is the pickiest eater of all time. So if she say's it's her favorite, it really means something.   The night before we dined at Joel Robuchon and Le Cirque was much better. If you have to choose between one and the other, Le Cirque is the way to go.   The staff is first-rate. Everone we encountered was very professional and at the top of their game. Everyone involved with table service had been there since the Las Vegas location opened back in 1974. That says a lot about what a quality place this is.  We ordered off the pre-theater menu. $72 a person. There are ample choices and it's substantially less than the regular menu. It's only available from 5:00pm-5-:45pm.   We ended up ordering off both the pre-theater menu ($72) and the prix-fixe menu ($108). Whatever you order, the courses must match. For instance, everyone at the table must have a three-course dinner, five-course dinner, etc. You can order off different menus, as long as it's the same number of courses for each person.   For starters, they bring over the bread. You must have the chocolate coffee bread.Trust me, it's a must try. I could have just eaten that bread and been perfectly satisfied.   I'm not going to go into great detail about the food. It was all excellent and well presented. I had the Rabbit Symphony. It was very rich and pretty salty. I would almost knock off a star for it, but everything else was so terrific, I'm still sticking with my five stars.  My friend had the potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass. She sent it back because she didn't know the potato was fried. (I told you she's picky!) They allowed her to order the diver scallops off the prix-fixe menu and still only charged us pre-theater price. We didn't ask them to do that, but it was a very nice gesture on their part, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back because of how splendidly they handled the situation. Above and beyond! Bravo Le Cirque!!  For dessert, I had the Petite Boule de Chocolat, Eclats de Noisette Caramelisee, Glace Chocolat Blanc\", which translates to Chocolate Ball. YouTube this one. It's a really fun dessert to watch transform when they pour hot chocolate over it.   If you want a truly memorable fine dining experience, and you like French food, this is a wonderful choice when you are in Las Vegas.    It's a very popular restaurant for good reason, so make your reservations as far ahead of time as you can if you want to be sure and get a table.",

Everyone is friendly and accommodating.  We had a reservation at 7 and a show at 9 and the servers did everything they could to make sure we would be on time.  The people who work here are knowledgeable about every aspect of the service and food so if you have any questions at all they will be happy to help.   A lot of people suggest that you get the chocolate coffee bread as a starter, but I actually liked the rosemary herb bread.  It was delicious and perfect for my salt loving pallet with the butter.    We had the 5 course menu and the food is incredible. I mean everything is just amazing, its hard as I said to put into words. But my favorite thing was the Maryland Blue Crab which is an open crab, topped with caviar and dressed with this beautiful smoke.  It comes out looking like an art piece basically and was rich delicious.  I've never had something so beautiful and honestly never had caviar, but I now understand the appeal.  In other words, yes, its totally worth the $65 up-charge for it.",

    "text": "As a mother's day present, I treated my family to .a fine dining experience at Le Cirque. The night was a series of highs and lows.  The Entry When we arrived, we were escorted to a nice seating area and offered cocktails while our table was prepared. The staff was extremely hospitable and friendly, but still maintained their professionalism. We were then escorted to a table that had a view of the Bellagio fountain. I gave my mother that seat and she was elated. The only negative was there was another family seated next to us wearing jeans and t-shirts despite the restaurant making it clear that formal attire is required. They were a minor eye sore.  The Menu The Menu consisted of four pages. Each page had a different tasting menu. I was debating between the 10 course tasting and 5 course tasting + upgrades. The entire table must participate in these options, which is standard policy to allow the restaurant to coordinate servings. My family convinced me to opt for the 5 course option. Then came the upgrades.   - Of course we added the wine pairing. It would be a crime to not do this when offered and curated by a sommelier.  - We also opted for blue crab with caviar and gold flake (+$50 or $60). - Fois gras was also added (+$35). We'd obviously make this choice. I always wonder why they even ask. It's like when you go to a Mexican restaurant and they ask if you want guacamole. Who ever says no? - next came the A5 Japanese Wagyu Ribeye. This came in at $105 for 3 oz. I had just come back from a trip to Japan where I had plenty of Kobe beef, so I wasn't going to get this option since it was so pricey for a lesser cut (for those who don't know, Kobe is a very specific version of A5 wagyu and is the absolute best). The sommelier overheard us talking about the reason we wouldn't get this upgrade (it's not Kobe), and he interjected that it was, in fact, Kobe. I double checked this with the waiter, who confirmed that it was Kobe. This was puzzling since I knew only a handful of restaurants in the US are certified providers of authentic Kobe beef. The waiter told me how hard they worked to get this certification. Oh man, did this pump me up! I insisted that everyone order this course since I knew what kind of treat they were in for.  The Food/Wine The meal started off very well. The blue crab was exceptional. My stepdad - who never had caviar before - made sure that not a single egg remained. The yellowfin crudo was so we'll balanced. The acid (I think it was yuzu) just raised the bar. Next came the fois gras. They didnt include any vessel to help us shovel it in our mouths, so we had to eat it straight up with a fork and knife. As expected, this was another amazing course. All the food has been marvelous, and the wine matched.  Then came the piece de resistance - the kobe. When it came out, there were two pieces per plate. The cut was way thicker than I was used to, which made it look more like the steaks I make at home (which I love). I know better than to put a big hunk of Kobe in my gullet, so I cut off a small piece and closed my eyes to savor the flavor. Hmm, not much flavor. How is this possible? I break off a bigger piece. It was OK. I had a deep suspicion that I'd been duped and that this isnt Kobe. The table seemed to be ignorant to this fact as they haven't had it before, so I kept my suspicion to myself. The dessert came out next. The chocolate was too sweet for my taste, but it was slightly balanced by the bitter taste of contempt that was forming in my stomach.  The Verdict Overall, the meal and experience was very good. I'd put it at 4.25 stars. But the next day, I investigated my hunch that we didn't eat Kobe beef. I couldn't find any list of certified Kobe beef restaurants in the US which contained Le Cirque. This sort of deception (or ignorance) is just unacceptable when the final bill is over $1,700. I wouldn't go back.",

We did the five course dinner with the wine pairings. I cannot recommend the wine pairing enough.

I am by no means a high roller but do like to have good meals and have visited Le Cirque in the past as well as many other nice restaurants in Las Vegas as I travel there frequently.  First, I'll talk about the food.  I got the Lobster and Avocado salad.  Pretty good especially considering I'm from the east coast and can be a snob when it comes to Lobster.    Then, I got the Wa-gyu rib eye.  It was overcooked...on the far side of medium.  I left more than half on my plate.  Desert chocolate ball.  I liked it a lot.  My friend didn't particularly like it.  Now the service: It did take a long time...even for fine dining standards.    I inquired with my waiter and expressed that the wa-guy was overcooked and he looked put off, dare I say annoyed.  We were in a bit of a hurry and I am not one for returning an entree and then waiting to get it again.  And he never offered to do so.  So, who knows what would happen in the back if I did.  No offer to remove from bill as is customary for an uneaten entree where the customer has expressed displeasure.    I frequent Vegas and was excited to go here and have heard good things.  I just did not have that experience.",

From the moment we stepped in, the service was impeccable. We were seated with a nice card acknowledging our anniversary. Our waiter also congratulated us as well and treated us so kindly throughout the night, giving us some extras. The first extra that came out was an amazing carrot concoction nestled inside an eggshell. I could have eaten 10 of those.   The chocolate coffee bread that everyone has written about is truly amazing. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life (and that's saying a lot). Our waiter not only brought me over extra slices of that chocolate coffee bread but he also wrapped up a few slices and slipped them into a to-go box for me to eat later. I could have married that man!  For our meals, everything was excellent. I started with the Hamachi which tasted so fresh and had a nice yuzu complement. My partner had the lobster and avocado which was also delicious with generous pieces of lobster. For mains, he got the symphony of rabbit and I got the potato wrapped sea bass. That sea bass had the most rich, flavourful sauce. Perfection.  For dessert, he had cheesecake (with a Degas painting printed on top!) and I had the infamous chocolate ball. For chocolate lovers, this was the way to go. Just when you think you're done, we got a tray with macaroni and a little box with chocolate truffles. The waiter also gave us a signed menu from the chef which was a thoughtful souvenir.   I loved every part of our meal, and I didn't want it to end. I could easily imagine coming here again and splurging on the 10 course meal. Maybe for our next anniversary!",

After a quick conversation one of the servers explained me that the whole staff is working there from the moment they opened the restaurant, which can explain it all. First, their bloody marry - I never had it before with mustard or maybe it was a horseradish mustard? I'm not sure...but it was the BEST bloody marry I ever had. For an appetizer I tried the goose liver, it was cooked perfectly, juicy, melting in your mouth. My friend tried the beef tartar with mustard - amazing! For the main course I tried the lamb, one lamb chop and a lamb chunk with a puff pastry baked goodie, I can only say FIVE STARS, it was one of the best lambs I ever had, surprisingly it didn't have that smell that usually lams has. We shared few desserts, the ice cream  was great with a raspberry sauce that was perfectly sweetened. The chocolate souffle was supper fluffy, not too dry not too wet, not too sweet.  I will defiantly be back!",

The meat was so tender it wouldn't even stay on the fork. And the chocolate ball finished the night on a sweet side.  The sea-bass a bit overcooked for my liking.

Our experience with Kobe has been \"hit or miss\", but this was phenomenal.  We don't expect any sort of \"value\" with high-end dining; but considering we dropped $1200 at Joel Robuchon 2 days prior, this seemed (relatively speaking) to be a pretty good deal!!!",

The magnificent sauces they give you are just perfect and every course that follows the appetizers just get better and better.

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT TO YOUR SHOW ON TIME. When we spend over $700 for a fancy French dinner, there is an expectation of extraordinary service. However, altogether they were INCOMPETENT, and as a result, WE WERE LATE FOR OUR SHOW and MISSED THE BEGINNING. We arrived when they opened at 5:30PM, and we were asked at least twice whether we were seeing a show. We had tickets for the 7:30PM show located in the same hotel, and they were aware of this from the beginning. When we were seated we were offered the regular menu, and we had to ask for the pre - theater menu, which made us believe that we could order off of either menu. Some of us ordered from the pre - theater menu, and others ordered off the regular menu. Our main course arrived at around 7PM, and it could have tasted good if we had time to taste it. Instead, we had to eat quickly, so that we could make it to our show on time. We got up to ask for our check at 7:15PM. We thought about getting our desserts boxed to go, but we naively believed that dessert would come shortly. One of the wait staff wished us to enjoy the show, but we had not even received dessert yet. At around 7:25PM, we were stuffing dessert down, and then we rushed to the show. However, we were late and missed the beginning of our show because of their incompetence and lack of care. They should not offer a pre - theater menu if they cannot serve a 3-course meal in a timely fashion. Vegas shows have regular start times, and they should know better. There is no good excuse! This was a special occasion, and it was ruined. Some of the wait staff were friendly, but others snubbed us, probably because we didn't order alcohol or because we were Asian. They didn't even apologize for their slow service and underplayed how late it was, and their lack of acknowledgement of the situation is disrespectful. I would never recommend this restaurant, and I would highly recommend AGAINST it for such poor service.",

    "text": "Probably because I didn't come here as hungry as I would have liked, but the meal fell below my standards. My standards for a meal like this would probably be Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, and Bistro de Paris in Orlando. This isn't to say that Le Cirque wasn't good - I enjoyed my meal, but my expectations were a bit higher than what was delivered to us, because of the service and the food.  The atmosphere is beautiful. You can see the Bellagio water show multiple times through the windows, and the interior is decorated accordingly - like a glamorous circus. I loved the murals, the drapery on the ceiling, and the whole French circus meets designer theme.  Service - I docked a star for this. We were served by many different servers. I was surprised, to say the least; he only time I've ever had that happen is in chain restaurants that I frequent for good happy hour sushi deals. This became a problem when we needed something because we were not sure which server to call over, and they never seemed to come around enough. On top of that, they were polite, prompt, and smooth, but that was it, and at a restaurant of this caliber, I expected much, much more. More description of the dishes, more coming around to check up on us, or maybe introducing your name (oh wait, that would have happened multiple times because we had multiple servers). And no, being French is not an excuse; the other fine French restaurants I've dined at have delivered impeccable, WAY-above-the-bar service, and I have never failed to remember our server's name because they are THAT good.  I got the foie gras saute as an appetizer, le lapin (rabbit) as my main course, and delice de framboise (raspberry sorbert, raspberry milkshake, raspberry gelee) for dessert.  The foie gras was good, but I wish I went with the foie gras au torchon instead; the foie gras was tender and juicy, and the caramel was interesting, though it was not to my liking when the sweet and salty mixed (or rather, clashed) together. The fruit was a great accent and I wish there was more of that flavor to balance out the foie gras, rather than the caramel butterscotch that they used.  The rabbit had nice texture, but was rather heavy. I don't think the roasted loin did anything for the dish in terms of enhancing its flavor, but the ravioli was delicious and new. The flavor was too salty, in my opinion; I kept trying to avoid the riesling sauce whenever I took a bite..  Delice de framboise was near heaven. The sorbet was the perfect texture, and was complemented perfectly by the raspberry milkshake and gelee that it sat upon. Its plating was also gorgeous, in a nestlike bowl atop a pink sugar nest, and with gold flakes and a curved strip of chocolate.  I'm not sure who, but someone definitely escorted us out as we were leaving and cheerily said that they hoped to see us again and that they hoped we enjoyed it and etc., etc. He sounded very friendly, very genuine, and if service had been like that all night, this place would have gotten 4 stars instead of 3 from me.  So, in short, a nice meal with beautiful atmosphere and good food... but service is merely average (not to mention confusing with the multiple servers) and I'm sure that, being in Las Vegas, you could find a finer restaurant that will deliver a finer culinary experience to your taste buds.  Sorry Le Cirque. I wanted to like you so badly, but I was not blown away like I wanted to be (so, so badly). Maybe it was cause I was wearing jeans and a jacket and had no time to change and dress up... but to be fair, my jeans alone cost more than our entire meal (so you can't say I dressed like a cheapass and that's why I got subpar service, haha).",

Amidst the madness of disgusting bug-like creatures, stench of cigarettes, and manifestations of the True circus of the grotesque, we spotted this elegant restaurant. It was calling out to us like Noah's Arc in the middle of Bob Dylan's Dessolation Row.  The Chef's tasting manu was amazing. It was what you would expect, punctuated by premium wines.  The 1929 Maury stood out.  The view of the Bellagio Fountains was a nice bonus.  The service was the True category killer. it rocked.  The number of staff, the knowledge base (ie.William the Som was masterful.), the attention to detail.  They had me at \"hello\".  The best dining experience I had in Vegas, and one of the top 10 ever. Is there more to say?",

Service was great and the sommelier was very laid back and helpful.  The wine list had a wide range of selections and many different price points.  I had really great sweetbread dish with morel mushrooms and thyme.  The duck is excellent and the desserts are fantastic.  My husband has  a poached meringue in vanilla ice cream sauce that was outstanding.    I liked this place better than Alex.    A few of the preparations at Alex were a bit more imaginative, but Alex is higher priced, has way more expensive wine, and is a bit stuffy.   Most of the staff at Le Cirque have been there for many years and were very friendly.  We are local and it is our new favorite place.",

    "text": "First - the food is wonderful.  BUT I had a terrible experience at the restaurant that is unforgiveable.  I was with my mother (86) my aunt (79) and 2 additional friends. I booked our reservation weeks in advance and informed them that we would be attending Cirque de Soleil in the same hotel.   We were seated at 8:20 for our 8pm reservation and then ordered after 8:30.  I informed all the staff (so many come to the table) that we needed to leave by 9:45pm.  They couldn't have cared less!  it isn't my job to know how slow their service is!  I thought that excellent service was one of the benefits of an expensive restaurant. I guess not.   At 9:40, the waiter suggested we order souffle for dessert because it only takes 15 minutes to make it and we would have plenty of time.  What an ASS. By the time we got out of there, we barely made the show and were seated at the very last possible moment.  Le Cirque ruined my dinner and almost my entire evening.  Unless they apologize to me, I would never ever go back.",

    "text": "The waiting area as you come in by the hostess was nice and well decorated. The hostess was welcoming and friendly; sitting at the bar the bartender asked if I wanted a drink and I mentioned about a drink I tried elsewhere to see if he has heard of it. He didnt but offered if I could find the ingredients online he would attempt to make the drink himself. I looked it up on my phone and showed him the ingredients and his version was pretty good as well. Entering the dining area was a surprise as it was a lot smaller then I anticipated. It can make for an intimate dining experience but also falls to increased background noise due to its small size. The table was nice and presented well; the staff seated us and pulled the chairs out as well as placing the napkins on our laps. Dining as a vegetarian for this meal was challenging as the menu did not have many vegetarian choices but the waiter helped out and created vegetarian dishes from what was on the menu. The presentation of all the dishes were good; the food itself was good from the chilled pea soup, to the salad and vegetarian risotto. It just wasnt great; it all tasted good but I was not blown away by it. The desert was probably the best part of the meal as it had a unique presentation and tasted delicious. Overall the dining experience went well, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, good wait staff but I just felt as something was missing that didnt make it a great dining experience.",

We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing and the sommelier did an excellent job of describing the wines as well as the region and vineyard they came from.  It was almost like taking a class.  A ridiculously tasty class with alcohol.  Now to the food.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  From the lobster salad to the white truffle risotto to the Wagyu beef.  Le Cirque is definitely on my \"Come back here soon\" list",

There's nothing that I can say about the food that Michelin hasn't already. We also had a very knowledgeable sommelier who put together a wine flight to accompany our meal. We were very impressed with each wine that he brought us.   What set Le Cirque apart from other restaurants was the fantastic staff. For background, I had just turned 24 and my friend was 23. We were the only people under 30 and the only platonic friends. Usually in a restaurant like this, I expect to be talked down to and ignored. This was not at all the case. Our servers were very respectful and treated us like any other clients and even matched our whimsy at times. It made us feel much more comfortable and less out of place.",

    "text": "This review is for their dessert  Stopped by a little after 10pm exactly one week ago, as the 3rd stop on our Vegas eating spree! They were already closed, but were kind enough to allow us to join them at the bar for dessert.  We were recommended a tasty glass of Moscato D'Asti to accompany our desserts.  Next thing you know, compliments of the pastry chef: tequila lime sorbet with pink grapefruit, grapefruit gelee, and pop rocks (see my photos). What a delightful and refreshing start to dessert!  This was followed by a platter of pre-dessert treats!  And then, our desserts! OUR JAWS DROPPED at the presentation! We immediately captured images of these gorgeously amazing, elaborate creations!  My vanilla poached strawberries with yuzu cream and crunchy streudel arrived in a sculpted bowl of ice, atop a mountain of crushed ice. Good looking, tasty, well-balanced, and a generous portion!  My partner's glossy sugar sphere was filled with lycee cream and dragon fruit cubes (and maybe something else I'm forgetting?). I've never seen anything like it! OMG SO GOOD! That is, after he reluctantly agreed to crack the sugar sphere. You've got to look at the pic of this one!  As if that weren't enough to make me feel like the most spoiled Princess EVER, I was given a jewelry box with secret compartments concealing truffles!!!  The service was excellent! The staff were attentive, gregarious, generous, and welcoming. The presentation of the desserts was out of this world! The desserts and dessert wine were top notch.  We are DEFINITELY coming back to experience a full meal here the next time we're in Vegas!!!!  Merci beaucoup Le Cirque!",

While I was only able to try their excellent chocolate souffle, the chocolate ball looked intense too. For the meal I started with the escargot and went with the butter poached lobster for my main. Both were solid four star dishes, but neither pushed my tastebuds to new heights.

    "text": "Extremely impressed all-around by Le Cirque, which was a pleasant surprise as I was not impressed by the one in NYC when I dined there several years ago. I had a group of friends in town for a couple days and we were so happy with our dining experience here that we immediately booked a second visit during their short trip.  Let's get the decor out of the way, because I rarely if ever comment or care much about the ambiance of restaurants - but I love the decor and layout of the restaurant and ambiance here. It is cozy without being confined, intimate without being too loud, and just overall feels romantic. It's such a lovely place to be.  Service is also top notch in every way. With French restaurants, I am always scared of the staff being pretentious or even condescending. Here, the staff are incredibly well-trained and knowledgeable, and show attention to detail while not at all being overbearing or pretentious. The sommelier was wonderful to talk to about wines all throughout dinner, and engaged us with discussions on the various vineyards and regions that his pairing picks were from.  Finally, the best and most important part - food is great. I would describe Le Cirque as top-notch execution with sufficient innovation to keep things interesting. My personal favorites for appetizers were the yuzu hamachi with avocado, the poached egg ravioli with mushrooms, and the langoustines with caviar. For the big dish, I loved the rabbit tasting, duck, and dover sole.  Don't skip the desserts either. Between our two trips we tried every one on the menu and they were all great. My personal favorite was the yuzu, strawberries, and cream served in an ice bowl. Just decadent in every way.   Le Cirque is now my go-to fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas. Easy 6* if I could.",

    "text": "I had no expectations walking into Le Cirque for dinner, it was just unplanned and pretty much winging it. I was surprised to find a reservation slot at 8pm the morning of, and luckily it wasn't so busy on a Sunday night.   We were seated in the middle of the circus ring, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Too bad my back was turned towards the fountains otherwise I wouldn't be talking to my friends at the table at all. Overall, the setting is very clustered, if you're a bit claustrophobic, good luck.  Like always, our table was probably the youngest ones at the restaurant. Perhaps that might be the case which I felt a bit rushed through during the first half of my dining session. We ended up all getting the degustation menu which consists of amuse bouche, appetizer, another appetizer, fish dish, meat dish, pre dessert, mini tarts, and main dessert. As always, you can describe the meal portions as \"meals for ants\" but really, all those courses can add up, especially with a lot of heavier ingredients for the courses in the middle.   I ended up ordering the uni panna cotta, foie gras, prusciutto wrapped monkfish, veal cheeks, and the vanilla poached strawberry.  Overall, my dishes were absolutely great but not enough to amaze me. Overall, the dishes were not eye opening in terms of originality. I was a bit surprised at how much was influenced by Japanese cuisines. They made all of their ingredients to its perfection. A lot of stuff going on with the textures moreso than flavors. You have a few different types of \"smooth and creamy\" going on in the uni panna cotta, a bit of an differentiating layers in the foie gras, a little bit of the dry and chewy in the prusciutto versus the moist and tender monk fish, different aspects of \"melting in your mouth\" within the creamy polenta and the veal cheeks. Especially my predesert, it was a tequila sorbet with strawberry poprocks and gelee. It was such a fun dish! Hell, it was a fun meal overall. But wait! I haven't even told you how in awe I was with my dessert, the vanilla poached strawberry. Other than my strawberry compote at L'Atelier, this is the only other time I was too shocked about how my dessert came out to be. I had no idea how to begin! My strawberries in yuzu cream were all served in an ice bowl that was stacked on top of these pinkish icy rocks on a silver plate. It looked like an inverse volcano of some sort. I felt like an little kid eating a strawberry sundae. Gorgeous piece! I'm so glad the server refused to let me change my order to the Grand Marnier souffle.   For the food and the atmosphere, this place deserves a 5 star ranking. However, for the service during the first half of the meal, I'm dropping a star. Mainly because I felt unwelcome with most of my meal rushed up, I didn't completely enjoy my dining experience. Luckily when the crowd had died down, our server had carried a few talks with us, gave us this chocolate cabinet (or rather mini cabinet with chocolates). But that was more like second half of the meal, better late than never. Turns out of server was quite humorous, sarcastically humorous, any sort of good conversation is definitely needed over a dinner.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to dine at Le Cirque during a recent trip to Las Vegas. This New York City fine dining outpost is located in the lovely 5-star Bellagio Hotel and Resort, and is one of the cornerstones of the hotel's dining experiences. My expectations for the restaurant were quite high, but both the floor staff and kitchen fully delivered with an amazing meal and a very memorable evening.  My recommendation is to definitely go with the Le Cirque degustation menu rather than ordering a la carte, and certainly do opt for the lovely wine pairings. You will not be disappointed. Unlike some tasting menus, you will have an element of control in the selection of your dishes while still experiencing the full range of what the chef and his staff can create. The exemplary service from the wait staff and sommelier at Le Cirque is professional and attentive without feeling at all intrusive.  Although I ordered the snow crab as my starter, I was surprised when the waiter brought a lovely amuse bouche of uni with lemon grass gelee and a fennel puree. It was sublime, as was my actual starter of snow crab with turnip, apple, avocado and pomegranate.  Sauteed foie gras with pear confit - and a salty caramel sauce - did not disappoint. It was delicate and well balanced. My only complaint is that I could easily have eaten three portions. But with a tasting menu one must be patient and pace ones self.  Although I hail from Alaska, I do like to see how chefs handle our seafood bounty. Alaskan black cod with citrus, shellfish and coconut nage was perfectly cooked and received my vote of confidence. There was a pleasant touch of acidity that perfectly counterbalanced the richness of the fish.  Less successful was the suckling pig tasting with purple potato and a truffle vinaigrette. The bit of pork loin was succulent but other porcine portions of the dish were sadly dry and over-cooked. In hindsight I wished I'd ordered the Kobe beef tenderloin enjoyed by a gent at the next table - it looked delicious, and his murmurs of approval spoke volumes.  Dinner finished with a sweet-savory pre-dessert, a dessert of fluffy chocolate souffle and assorted petit fours, and the evening wrapped up with a lovely gift box of truffles. This was a meal that I did not want to ever see end.  Is dining at Le Cirque it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely, emphatically yes. Don't ask questions ... just do it.",

    "text": "Amazing.   Great way to start off our Vegas vacation. After reading reviews online, we decided to try Le Cirque in the Bellagio. We were seated on time and promptly welcomed by the wait staff.   We both decided to get the Prix Fixe menu ($105/person), which includes an appetizer, entree and any one dessert. The Sommelier assisted us in picking a bottle of wine in a friendly and informative matter.   We were provided an Amuse-bouche of salmon, which was fresh and delicious. The meal only got better. Each course was described to us and was as delicious as they sounded. The escargot was amazing - as well as the lamb.   Save room for dessert as well, the souffle was great, as well as the chocolate sphere.   Definitely would recommend for a nice dinner in Vegas!",

    "text": "***Le Cirque is a French restaurant with a quality similar to La Folie and Gary Danko; the food is decent but because it is in Las Vegas, it (like many other high-end Vegas spots) is not worth the high price tag***  Le Cirque is a well regarded transplant from New York City.  It is a French restaurant, but it is a much less formal dining experience than Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy.  The restaurant's decor is a signature element.  The room is covered in circus murals and even the ceiling is a tent canopy to really create a circus-esque atmosphere (albeit a high end one).  Several menu options are available.  There is a six course tasting menu (where you have some choices) as well as a 3-course a la carte starter, entree and dessert option.  A fast pre-theater menu (of 3 courses) is also available.  I went with the 3-course a la carte menu and added an extra starter.  The meal started with a trio of salmon amuses.  There was salmon tartare with roe, salmon gravlax with honey and dill, and smoked salmon atop a potato waffle.  All of the amuses were good and really showcased the salmon.  There was a wide variety of bread options.  I chose the pretty good bacon baguette.  I also had the French bread, which had a pretty good chew.  I started with the white alba truffle risotto, which was expensive but very good.  The risotto rice was very nicely cooked.  It was al dente with a noticeable bite.  The risotto was creamy and had a good Parmesan flavor (some might find it a tad too strong or salty).   The white truffles were great--very nice flavor and strong aroma.  The truffles were not as good as the ones I had in DC at CityZen, but that could just be because white truffle season is ending. The only thing that could have been better was the presentation.  They should have shaved the truffles tableside.  If you do not want to pay the supplemental charge or are not a fan of truffles, a good lobster risotto is also available.  I also had the sauteed foie gras and it was nowhere near as delicious.  The foie gras was undercooked and it was not the best quality.  It was very broken and there were quite a few strands in it.  It was creamy but not that smooth.  The garnishes were okay.  I liked the crunch and flavor of the almonds.  I also liked the pineapple tart though it was a very small portion.  The quinoa was kind of just bland mush.  You can definitely see the difference between Le Cirque's foie gras (the first link) and Picasso's foie gras (the second link), which is much more refined, simple and clean (Picasso is also located in the Bellagio).  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p8ao29A31ijNwDXuAxQxjA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/picasso-las-vegas?select=GHrwF6JC4xmm5KknR_UHYw#FmNSTUhS4p7qmbufGVNMYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pica...</a>  My entree was a butter poached lobster tail and the lobster itself was nicely cooked.  It was very fresh and was mostly soft (a little tough in parts).  I really liked the garnish of caviar--a generous portion and very fishy, briny and salty.  The base of the lobster was a vanilla emulsion and I did not like it.  The sweetness and the very pronounced flavor of the vanilla kind of ruined the dish.  The garnishes of cauliflower and broccoli were average.  There was also a side dish of pomme puree, mushrooms and lobster meat.  This was messy, but it was good upscale comfort food.  For dessert, I oped for the grand mariner souffle, but I should have ordered the chocolate souffle instead.  The baking of the souffle was very good.  It had a nice lift and it was airy, light and moist.  The flavor of the grand mariner was too strong.  It was a very powerful flavor and the strong punch of alcohol diffused any sweetness this dessert had.  The meal ended with some mignardises including a pretty good cream-filled profiterole (with a hard candy-esque topping), a blueberry financier, a lemon meringue tart (similar to the ones they have at Platine in Culver City), and a caramelized fig tart.  Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  I did feel the service was a little rushed at times; Le Cirque's service just did not have the smooth ease of Bellagio's Picasso.  Prices were high, but that is to be expected given Le Cirque's location.  The food is about in the same price range as Picasso and I think the food at Picasso is much more refined, elegant and exquisite.  Le Cirque is a decent French restaurant.  It reminds me of La Folie and Gary Danko in terms of menu items and quality.  I think you could probably have a satisfying French dinner here, but it will probably not be worth the high price (like most Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip).  Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.",

Multiple menus are available here, but we all partook from the prix-fixe menu.  That evening's amuse bouche was a perfect way to get things rolling.  The appetizer of sauteed foie gras had a perfect flavor and texture, and the rabbit symphony brought things together in a perfect harmony.  And what evening would not be complete without dessert -- mascarpone and chestnut mousse with huckleberry compote and white coffee ice cream.    Is it more expensive than a lot of places?  Sure.

I started with a glass of cab while my friend had vodka with cranberry.  Both drinks were great.  The people next to us had a cheese plate and this dessert where chocolate sauce was poured over chocolate ice cream.  They loved both dishes.  My friend was then in the mood for fries.  They were not on the menu, but they made them for us anyway.  They were some of the best fries I ever had--really makes me wonder how good all of the other food is at Le Cirque.

    "text": "We did the 5-course tasting menu with the wine pairing, and decadent does not begin to describe the night. Ivo, Martin and Frederic took AMAZING care of us from beginning to end. Each man was charming, attentive and absolutely delightful. We felt like honored guests.  The restaurant is in the Bellagio, so you will likely have a view of the water fountain like we did. They pulled out our chairs and immediately got us set up with champagne, and it just got better from there. Each course (white asparagus soup, foie gras, sea bass, veal cheek and chocolate ball) was beautifully plated and incredibly complex in flavor, texture and aroma. Our sommelier Frederic gave us excellent pairings with each course and even humored me and my intermediate French for a couple lovely conversations. He also kept other staff in line and let them know to keep an eye on us in case we needed anything. We also got to try the blue crab dish with avocado, caviar and edible gold and WOW. It was visually stunning and an excellent addition, as was the sorbet before dessert. The menu really shines with the vegetables, as I enjoyed my chilled soup the most and my friend's favorite was the spring risotto. I got up to use the restroom and Martin showed up out of nowhere to show me where the restrooms were. Little piles of chocolates and macarons showed up at the end of the meal as we were paying the bill. Little things like that really make a difference. It was hands down the best meal I have ever had and is a must-have luxury experience in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been here twice for dinner and been happy both times. First off, I had the La Passion cocktail and would highly recommend it. It's fun to just have a cocktail because the atmosphere and ambience is so fun, with the huge drapery mimicking the circus.   Bread was not my favorite but not the worst either-- the chocolate coffee is worth trying. The standout dish here that I will always remember is the truffle tagliatelle. There is truffle in the pasta and a LOT more truffle on top. They just come by and start shaving. So decadent! The lobster avocado salad is also outstanding. For the main course, I had the diver scallops which were solid but I felt the potato-crusted sea bass was the better choice. It's such a classic dish but executed so perfectly and really worth your pick. Finally, you can't go wrong with the souffle for dessert, although I am also a panna cotta fan.  It's a highly recommended choice for a special occasion or a just because. I would be happy to return here again and again!",

A gnat landed on my entree which they immediately took away and replaced which didn't really bother me.  But as the bus boy came to clear out dishes, he reached over the table and spilled on my friend's fancy leather bag that absorbs water and stains very easily.  We brought this to the waiter and manager's attention and the manager apologized and said he would make things right and pay for the cleaning.  Apparently he had no idea how much and when my friend actually tried to pursue the cleaning fee was met with resistance so she had to escalate it to Bellagio.  In the end it all worked out but always protect your items from wait staff spillage--even at these nice restaurants!!",

Fast forward 2018, my wife and I now live in Las Vegas. We decided to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary at Le Cirque. I called and the staff is always the nicest and most accommodating. There are only 3 restaurants in all of Las Vegas with service like this.   I told them I wanted to eat the secret menu Surf and Turf that I had read about in magazines. With 1 months notice they were more than happy to accommodate.  That night the service was amazing, the food was fantastic and the way we were treated makes us know how wonderful and special each and every member of the staff at Le Cirque Las Vegas is. They are impeccable with their anticipation of what you could possibly need or want. They are pristine in the quality of experience they provide. I can not give enough accolades especially to Ivo the general manager and Fredrick the Sommelier along with quite literally every other staff member from waiters to bus staff.",

I had the hamachi, which had a complex combination of light, fresh flavors, followed by the red snapper, probably the best fish I've ever had. The snapper was paired with perfectly cooked vegetables and served with a slightly nutty sauce. My husband got the beef tartar and then the filet, which were both wonderfully flavorful, although less experimental than the fish dishes. The two desserts, the chocolate souffle and a raspberry dish, were both delicious. We had told the server that we were newlyweds, and the desserts came with \"congratulations!\" written in chocolate and four small complimentary tarts -- adorable! The playful old-fashioned circus decor was a nice touch, too. We may have to return for an anniversary!",

There was one point where we had 3 waiters at our table: 1 was filling up our water, 1 was cleaning off the table, and 1 was bringing additional food. Talk about VIP service.   -Amuse Bouche: I honestly don't remember what it was but it was like a corn soup deal (they switch their amuse bouche throughout the night btw) but it was warm, savory and yummy -Foie Gras Special with sangria and a side of cooked date and fig (not on the menu): DELICIOUS! I'm a big fan of foie gras so the sangria gave it a nice oomph to it. Nice way to start off the meal -Chilean Sea Bass: Not the typical kind that I was used to (really oily, delicious and yummy) since this was more fried on the outside. Still good but not exactly what I was hoping it'd be -Rabbit symphony: Very, very rich tasting but worth a try. It's full of flavor but like I said, it's extremely rich so if you're not a fan of that, maybe you shouldn't try this. -Chocolate sphere dessert: Got this whole show going on where you melt hot chocolate onto it and the sphere breaks, revealing the hazelnut goodness inside. THIS was really delicious -Creme Bruelee: Pretty standard but they give you a generous amount   If you're lucky, you can even get a seat next to the window where you can view the water fountain show. The food was good but the service is really what turned this place into a 4. I'm a huge fan of great service and this one was exceptional.",

    "text": "This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! I have been twice, and on my 2nd visit, the waiters/staff all remembered me and remembered where I sat and what I had ordered!  Pretty impressive.   Both times I order the pre-theater menu. It's a great deal and a great way to try their amazing food. During the two visits, I have had the lobster bisque, the risotto (they were even willing to substitute the lobster risotto for the tomato risotto at no extra cost since I don't like tomato!), the sea bass in pinot noir reduction (twice), and the chocolate sphere which has pieces of real edible gold in it. Definitely get it with the wine pairing! The sommelier is very helpful.  Also, the bread selection is wonderful (e.g., rosemary bread, pretzel bread, bacon bread, etc), and they bring both salted and unsalted butter.  Everything is very tasty, and the service is perfection!  The waiters are attentive.  When the waiter noticed that I was picking the peas out of my risotto, he came running back with a spoon to remove them all from my plate for me so that I \"wouldn't have to look at them\". It was really sweet, although unnecessary since it wasn't a big deal to me to have them in there. I also love the little jewelry box of truffles that they give you. When they found out that I was meeting up with a friend after dinner, they offered to give me an extra one to give her. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this place. I plan to come here every time I'm in town.",

    "text": "For a fine dining restaurant, I thought Le Cirque was just okay.  The service was great and it did have a nice view to the Bellagio water show.  The four of us ordered from the \"Pre-Show\" menu which I thought was decently priced.  It was a three-course meal that was just okay, in my opinion.  I started with the risotto.  It was slightly on the salty side and therefore tasted a bit off-balance.  The main course was some fish dish that I thought was decent, but not the best thing I've ever had.  The desserts were AH-MAZING.  Because there were four of us, they offered us four different desserts that we all shared.  The Creme Brulee was HEAVENLY and was definitely my favorite of the bunch.  In addition to the four desserts, they gave us a tray of small chocolates and other delights, and as a good-bye gift, they gave each of us a tiny little gold box of chocolate truffles to enjoy later.",

The oyster amuse bouche was delicious. Even the oyster hater at our table thought it was tasty. The lobster salad was very good, as was the fois gras. One of my dining companions upgraded from the fois gras to the truffle risotto, and in my opinion the upgrade was worth the extra $35.00. I stole a taste, and that risotto was the best I've ever tried.  The sea bass wasn't a hit for me, but everyone else at the table loved it. To me, it tasted as if there was a hint of something moldy in the accompanying vegetables, and I found the pastry wrap a bit greasy.   The duck course was excellent. The desserts were to die for. I tend to be disappointed with the desserts in high end restaurants, but not here. We were served a molten chocolate lava cake, a citrus sorbet served in an ice bowl, and an unbelievable pear souffle. All were fabulous.   The service was attentive and friendly without being overly familiar or intrusive. I enjoyed every moment of my evening, which more than made up for my disappointment with Twist at the Mandarin Oriental the previous night.  I will return to Le Cirque the next time I'm in Vegas.",

If you are in the mood for risotto, then Le Cirque is the place for you. With at least half a dozen offerings daily, including Lobster risotto, you will definitely have your fill. I was suggested the squid ink risotto by the wait staff, but my wife and I were not brave enough.  The lobster salad, their signature dish, is by far the best lobster salad I have had anywhere.   Le Cirque is a great place to kill three hours...especially if the tables in Vegas haven't been so kind!",

    "text": "With Le Cirque's reputation (and many, many fabulous reviews), I had high expectations... and some of my expectations were met. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, the food was beyond disgusting. I consider myself somewhat adventurous when it comes to food, so it's not like I disliked it because of inexperience.   Again, because of the number of raving reviews on the lobster salad, I figured there was no question as to what I was ordering for my appetizer. It was ok. I had a lobster salad at Fleur de Lys the night before that was easily 10 times better.   My husband ordered the quail for his appetizer, which was good... but not anything to write home about. The truffle sauce they served with it, though, was delicious. Also, I'm usually not one to complain about small portions, as some of my favorite restaurants have small portions, but the quail was ridiculous. It was so tiny, it might as well have been an amuse bouche.   I ordered the lobster with king crab ravioli for my entree... this is the reason I am giving one star. If I could give zero stars, I would. The lobster was so incredibly rubbery and tough, I could barely cut through it with my knife. It also had such a horribly fishy taste that I only ate one bite. I decided to take a bite of my ravioli (even though the dough was dyed with squid ink, which I was already nervous about), and it was even worse than the lobster. I couldn't bring myself to swallow it on my first try, so I tried drinking some water with it. It took 4 tries to finally get it down because the taste was so awful. Immediately, I felt a strange pain in my throat and had the urge to throw up right at the table multiple times. I would have much preferred grabbing a big mac and fries from McDonald's. Seriously.   My husband ordered the rabbit. Also just \"good\".   I have been quite sick for ~5 days now and my doctor told me I probably have food poisoning. Needless to say, I will never go to Le Cirque again... even if someone paid me. Fleur de Lys at Mandalay (Huber Keller's restaurant) is a much better choice if you want fine French food in Vegas. In fact, it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. I'll be writing a review for them next.",

This was perfect - the service was not slow, they were silently attentive, only interuppting the conversation for the next course.  The staff was amazing... the food - wow.  I didn't think I'd like escargot - I was wrong.  It was rich, flavorful and decadent.  The fois gras - amazingly sweet in one dish, and savory on a steak.  If you love chocolate - get the chocolate sphere for dessert...   Just absolutely gorgeous interior, views and experience.",

The food was delicious, the ambiance was lovely, the wait staff was very attentive (they asked if we have any food allergies that we should be aware of which not a lot of restaurants do), it was all perfect.  The restaurant is definitely pricey but you definitely get what you pay for.  For the price conscious, they have a pre theater menu for $68 per person from 5:30 to 6:30PM.  I think it was around $95 to $100 if you want it with wine pairing.    One thing you should definitely get is the Beef Tenderloin that comes with the pre-theater menu.  Very tender.  At the end of the meal you get a little gift from the restaurant.    If I ever go back to Vegas, I would definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Minus one star for the slowness of service and the room in general. I get that things need to be cooked to order, but some attentiveness in between or acknowledgment that it had taken over 30 minutes for us to get from the first course to the next one would have been nice.   Also, I felt like I was sitting in the lap of one of the people in the table next to me. We basically had to maneuver our table in order to go to the bahtroom and I'm a small person -- I cannot imagine what someone of normal height would have to do. It's also not as if we were a surprise guest -- I made my reservations well in advance.   Thanks to the food, both of these issues were very much overshadowed.    Our meals began with their squash soup shooter and bread amuse bouche. Both were great. Then came the bread platter. Amazing. Between my boyfriend and I we tried all of them, our favorites being the bacon one (bacon!!!) and the lemon/rosemary one.   For my first course I had their seared foie dish. It was superb. Su-perb. The boy got the fruit de mer bowl and all in all it was good but not impressive since we hail from the land of seafood. The highlight of it though was the tuna in the middle. It melted in your mouth.  My main course was the duck. That was also great. Well seasoned and the confit of some of the leftovers that they gave me was also very good. My boyfriend's rabbit was also very well done. He had never had rabbit before and enjoyed it quite a bit.  By the time dessert arrived, we were both sufficiently stuffed. I ordered the chocolate souffle and it was everything I had hoped for. Rich. Creamy in the middle. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Sphere which was not only rich and tasty but also really cool to watch as they poured the sauce over it.  I really like the petit fours at the end but they seemed a bit overkill given how rich everything else was. The mini jewelry box with truffles was also a nice added touch.",

I specifically came to Le Cirque to try foie gras for the first time so I was excited that it was the very first course. It was amazing!   Appetizer: Sauteed foie gras with this light puff pastry bread with pears. Easily the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth and would return just for that dish. My friend got the lobster risotto which was cooked perfectly and had a bit of spice. Also delicious.   Dinner: Milk fed veal with the crispest asparagus tips I've ever had and black pepper mashed potatoes. I ordered my veal medium rare and my friend ordered hers rare and both came out cooked perfectly. Perfect portion sizes and just delicious.   Dessert:  I had the Tahitian vanilla bean creme brulee. It was easily the best creme brulee I've ever had but the Tahitian vanilla didn't really taste different from any other vanilla. Just my opinion. My friend had some fruit sorbet cream thing that came out in an ice bowl so the presentation was much nicer than the actual taste.   It's a once in a lifetime experience that I highly recommend for everyone who has $300 to throw away on a meal. I'm a total foodie and will remember this meal for the rest of my life.",

We also chose the reserve wine pairing to accompany our meal. The waiters are very knowledgeable about the food and wine. The scallop dish was one of the best we've ever had. My only complaint was with the wine pairing. Even though we chose the reserve pairing and my wife and I had different dishes we got the exact same wine with each dish. This makes me really wonder if they have a pairing for each dish they have on their tasting menu and if we even got the reserve pairing. I would have expected a different type of wine with each dish that was specifically chosen and paired by the sommelier.   The place is colorful and some tables have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains when they go off. The place is pricey as with most high end restaurants in Vegas but not ridiculous like Guy Savoy or Robuchon. I would return here again to dine in the future but will likely try some others before returning.",

My Dad is only happy with steak and baked potato but they were willing to try all the places we had scheduled for this Christmas trip. We had reservations at Gordon Ramsey steak, Le Cirque, Cut, Picasso,  la l'atelier de Joel Robouchon, and Carnevino.  I don't remember much about the food at this place which is why I am making a real effort to do my reviews  the day of the meal. But it also says the food here wasn't that great because I can remember other places were good. I do remember server was mad when I asked to split the check for my Dad and stepmom on one ticket and us on the other.  Beautiful place.",

    "text": "Maybe living in Northern CA close to Napa and Sonoma has spoiled me. But based on the reviews in Yelp, as well as recommendation from a friend,  we made a reservation at Le Cirque. Le Cirque was a huge disappoinment. We had a 9:15 reservation on a Friday night, we were promptly seated and the place was about 3/4 full. The wait staff, was not overtly friendly or energetic, nor very efficent, kind of like our entire experience there. I felt that perhaps the Le Cirque once had her day, but is now worn and in need of an eclectic upgrade (think Gordon Ramsey).  We ordered a bottle of Cakebread Sauv Blanc and it was poured near room temperature, this to me is a fatal error for a high end French eatery, I asked them to bring a bucket of ice to the table which they did without complaint, is was drinkable in about 30 minutes.  We ordered the 4 course tasting menu, eh...just not impressed. The snow crab apettizer was decent, but just as in any good sushi place. The next course was a tiny piece of Foi Gras, which has carmelized and served over crisp bread, perhaps the best part of the meal, as the John Dory was cooked dry, and way under seasoned, think Tilipia. The Rabbit breast was again cooked to sawdust dry, tasteless. My wife had the Duck Breast which I tried, it was much better, but an extremley small portion.  The other thing, and I noticed other Yelper's commnented on it, was the long wait between courses, at times uncomfortably long. Our entire dinning experience was 2 hours and 45 minutes. When they brough the check and couldn't wait to pay and get the hell out of there!",

The veal cheeks alone was almost worth the price of the meal. One of the best bites of red meat that I ever had.  The sea urchin and the foie gras were also perfect. The portion of foie gras was surprisingly large for a tasting menu.  The sea urchin was also the best I ever had, though I have had that many sea urchin before.  The prosciutto wrapped monk fish was the only dish less than perfect. It wasn't bad by any means, but the prosciutto taste kind of over whelms the monk fish taste.  In sum, the veal cheeks alone is worth the trip, sea urchin and foie gras made it a freaking bargain, and everything else were great option on top.",

I was highly anticipating this meal and my Thanksgiving dinner with close friends. To start the minimum per person was $145, so this created high expectations. Sadly I was let down. Some examples of feeling ripped off were:   up charges on choosing one item over another, specifically the $65 dollar upgrade for Kobe rib-eye instead of the Turkey was CRAZY. The turkey was in cube and gross, like really in a cube (vending machine or out of the can). The rip eye was half the size of a hockey puck and flat as a pancake, plus it was $65 dollars more.   DON'T DO IT... Some of the reviews on here are giving 5 stars, I don't get it... HOW? Is there anyone who has eaten here twice? Save yourself, there are better places to eat in Vegas for half the price.",

Constantly refilling water, giving you bread. They asked a million times if we had shows or other time constraints, so they do everything possible to maximize your experience.   The place is kind of small so the tables are close. It was close enough to see what the people next to you were eating but not close enough to hear their conversation clearly. The place is quiet so its great for a romantic dinner. It is located next the bellagio fountains and everything the show started I could hear the pumps go off. Ask for a window seat for the fountain view.  On to the food and wine. I had the tasting menu with the wine paring. I got to say, everything was excellent. Everything from the presentation of the food to the taste and wine was just perfect. The food that stood out the most to me was the foie gras. The flavor and texture was so good and unique that i could still taste it in my mouth now. Other things worth mentioning that I tried are the sea bass and the dessert I got (it was a chocolate ball).   If you have the time and money, you must try this place! The experience was one of a kind. I will definitely come again and recommend this place to anyone looking for fine dining. You will not be disappointed. Service and food is first class.",

Ambiance: Beautiful restaurant but they sure back you in.  Service: Wait staff were amazing. Did their job and explained every dish carefully and were attentive. Although the hostess was an idiot and made us walk back and forth between two restaurants because she was clueless. Maybe that just set the tone for the rest of my dinner...   Food: This is where it got dodgy. The salad was fresh but the scallop smelled \"fishy\" and that was utterly disappointing. The foie grae was mushy and was presented \"flat\" when it was presented. That was a first. The risotto was tasty with the truffles... very generous portions. Venison was solid... so there were some hits and misses... but I expect more from a restaurant where the seating costs over $125 per person.   Price: This place is pretty damn expensive and I'm not really sure it was worth it.   Overall, it was decent but I have had better dining experiences in LV.",

But you'd be remiss to not seek it out for some perfectly prepared classic French cuisine.    The dining room is beautiful, and the colorful tented ceiling paired with the soft lighting makes for a very romantic and cozy setting.  The staff and kitchen are friendly, helpful, and very accommodating.  They begin by offering you a choice of black or white napkin, which is always a good sign.  They had a 3-course option and a 5-course option on the menu, but gladly allowed us to create our own 4-course meal.  One friend asked for a custom cocktail with a strange combination involving Chartreuse, and they kindly obliged with a \"Table 90 Special\" cocktail that he very much enjoyed.  Clearly, they were used to accommodating special requests.  The food was excellent.  We had lobster risotto, hamachi crudo, seared foie gras, duck 2-ways, sole muniere, and a variety of desserts.  All very classic preparations, so nothing new or unique, but all done perfectly.",

    "text": "I don't know where to start!!! I originally planned to get a reservation at Picasso, but they didn't have any open slots left for Friday night, so that's how we ended up at Le Cirque. I like the whole circus concept of the restaurant - classy and unique.  This was my first fine-dining experience - decided to do it for my 21st birthday and left feeling very satisfied.  3 of us decided to go for the Degustation (tasting) menu for $135 and the other 2 ordered a la carte for $98. Oh! I learnt something new - the waiter asked if I would like a black napkin, I just went along with him and said yes but then thought, why do I get a black napkin?Maybe it's because I'm special? since he didn't offer the others black napkins, but then I googled it and realized it was because I wore a black dress and white napkins could leave lint residue on my dress. haha okay back to the food. We ordered quite a variety of dishes, so I got to try a lot that night. Everything was delicieux, so here are some of my favorites: - endive and scallop salad - the scallop was so perfectly cooked and sweet - truffle risotto (extra $40 - it's worth it): didn't know what truffle really tastes like, so I decided to get it and it was very creamy, earthy and truffle-y (don't know how else to describe it) - if you don't want to spend the extra $40 but want something that's worth that extra $40, get the Santa Barbara Sea Urchin - it's to die for. Warm and mixed with king crab and lemongrass  - Mediterranean sea bass - after having eaten the creamy risotto, I decided to go for something lighter and I'm glad I went with our server's recommendation (the Pinot Noir sauce is to die for - I'd take a shot of it over grey goose any day) - honey glazed duck - tres tres bien - got the cheese instead of the pre-dessert sorbet: they carved the cheese into a flower and served it with bread We each ordered their raspberry champagne to go with the food - champagne was light and you can't really taste the alcohol - perfect for someone like me who isn't a fan of any types of alcohol.  The best part for me was the dessert. It was amazing - creativity level 8 - petite boule de chocolat: it's a pretty big ball of chocolate, on which they pour hot chocolate. Once the chocolate sphere melts, you'll find praline, white chocolate ice cream and hazelnut caramel crunch inside If you love chocolate, this is what you should order - I think I died for a bit watching the chocolate sphere melt.  You know how they say it's the company, not the food that makes a dining experience great? I think this is a place where you can go eat alone and still have a great time. Our main server is very amicable and il est francais - got to practice a bit of my french haha  At the end of our meal, the server brought us a plate of petite desserts and the ladies get a small box of chocolates. What a perfect start to a great night!",

The beauty and of Le Cirque's interior will take you on a magic carpet ride away from the stresses and problems that exist on the exterior of our complicated world.   The decor is only the beginning of this extraordinary experience, as the beautiful plate ware and glassware play their part in this superb performance de cuisine.   You'll quickly notice the beauty is not only on the walls (and the ceiling), the food in front of you is a gorgeous work of art. It's been a while since my lady and I dined here, but I remember we were simply taken into a whole new world. Aromas, textures, colors, memories, and emotions explode from every dish. We had an unforgettable experience at Le Cirque.   A large part of this had to do with our server, a charming young man who truly understands his trade. He complemented the both of us immediately on our appearance, very thoughtful. He was perfect at answering any questions we had, providing recommendations when we asked about aperitifs and menu inquiries, and he knew how to treat people of our age (early 20's *at the time*) in this environment.   We've been offended a couple times by pompous and ungrateful attitudes from career servers at high-end establishments. I feel obligated to mention, we're not a complicated pair (with our food that is!) and we don't order light.   Our server, clearly understood this. He was entertaining, humorous, and respectful/appreciative/professional in relation to our total experience. He really made the evening splendid for the both of us. He even gave my girlfriend a Le Cirque purse holder, probably standard, but very cool never the less.   Allow yourself to be taken away by visiting Le Cirque during your stay in Sin City.",

Le Cirque's stellar reputation is well-deserved, as it is a sure treasure not only within the Bellagio hotel but all along the Las Vegas Strip.  Among the many recommended restaurants up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, Le Cirque is not to be missed.    This certainly qualifies as a \"fancy\" restaurant.  Though I don't think tie and jacket are required, diners are certainly NOT in jeans.  The prices are high-er, but honestly compared to many other of the wonderful and even not so wonderful restaurants in Vegas, one really can get quite a bang for his or her buck - items may be ordered a la carte, however Le Cirque offers a large and smaller prixe fixe option so you are able to taste much of what Le Cirque has to offer for a reasonable bill.  As high class as Le Cirque is, I never felt as if we were being looked down upon by any of the staff, who are ALL excited and knowledgable about Le Cirque's offerings.  The staff at a place like this is more than accommodating, and are working there for many reasons other than supporting themselves financially.    So what did we eat?!  We had the signature lobster salad, escargot (possibly best I've ever had), the rabbit, the sea bass, the chocolate boule and the creme brulee.  Oh, and the wonderful bread assortment and confection assortment that accompanied the meal.  I love sea bass and was un-familiar with this preparation of it - it was possibly baked in the potato casing it was wrapped in, or maybe steamed prior to... What really made the dish were the braised leaks and pinot noir reduction sauce the sea bass pocket was placed on top of.  A beautiful combination of tastes. (Not to mention the perfectly paired glass of pinot noir I had alongside the meal...)  Also, the butter the escargot sat in was much more than just melted butter.  If I attempted to describe it I wouldn't be able to do it justice.  Another wonderful array of flavors.      I was encouraged to order the creme brulee, which I was informed has been on the menu for years and is extremely unique.  It had wonderful vanillas flavors and a perfect consistency.  I'm excited to try an assortment of in-house made gelatos and sorbets next time...  Incredible fresh-baked breads.  The bread-server was a little surprised, and then compassionate, when I asked for a sampling of every kind of bread offered!    If you're celebrating or you merely make dining an important part of your life - oh, and if you love Vegas - Le Cirque needs to be put on your must-go list.",

It was just memorable....perfect all the way around.  My boyfriend ordered: The lobster salad and the lamb chop. Again, Oh my God, delicious!  His cousin ordered the Roasted chicken. It was sublime.  Moist, perfectly season and cooked.  It comes with a truffle sauce, she doesn't like truffle, but she wanted to bathe herself with it after the first taste.    For dessert we ordered: Some sort of chocolate filled thing.  When it arrived at the table, we were confused as to how to eat it, (because its a ball, a large ball) then, the waiter pours a chocolate sauce on top of it, and the ball start melting rather quickly, like magic! It was incredible good.  It was expensive, we spent almost $380 (including tip, if I remember correctly, it could be more) for: one glass of champagne, one salad, (lobster salad that is) and three main entrees.   So this place is not suitable for penny pinches!  You will not like it, trust me.  I know you people only like food based on price, so erase this place from your mind. You'll hate it!   But I think there is a pre-fix menu for less than $70 before the 7;30 show.  Don't know how good it is, but I guess, if bargains are your thing, then try it.",

    "text": "My wife and I did Vegas for Christmas last year for the first time. We booked a nice dinner for Christmas day, but decided to wing it on Christmas Eve. As the dinner hour arrived, we wandered over to the Bellagio to check on a couple of options. Our first few choices were booked for the evening, but Le Cirque had a table for two for immediate seating.  We had been to Le Cirque two years earlier for my wife's birthday, and it is by far one of the best meals that we have ever had. She is not afraid to announce Le Cirque as her favorite restaurant.   We were elated to be seated at the same table and to be served by the same server as we had during our last visit. Le Cirque is a fairly intimate setting without feeling crowded or stuffy. The service is timely, but not pushy. The Christmas Eve menu was simple, you could choose from one of two tastings: the Chirstmas tasting, or the Christmas Truffle tasting. Since this was an \"unplanned\" dinner we chose to stick closer to our budget and have the $155.00 standard Christmas tasting as opposed to the $255.00 truffle menu.  I decided against a wine pairing, but had Michael (our server) choose a nice glass of Pinot that arrived for our main course. Everything was sensational. Le Cirque knows how to deliver the complete package. It still ranks at the top of our dining experiences. We will be back.",

The food was good, but compared to other places in Las Vegas, I would not give it 5 stars - more like 4 stars. The ambiance is nice.  The service was not very good for sure. Dining at a place like this with prices like this, I would like to eat in peace. However, we felt quite rushed for some reason - not like we sat down for hours!   Sorry, just can't go above 3 stars here. It's just NOT the experience and food you would expect at a place like this. We will not be back.",

    "text": "Le Cirque is amazing and as best as it can in every way. Food was fantastic, the interior was the most beautiful with a circus element, and it is needless to say how amazing it was to dine while looking out the Bellagio fountain. The service was top class and the waiters were very attentive, working closely to cater to the needs of the diners.   Before I go further on to describe more about the restaurant and my experience, I must say that I was quite impressed with one thing. To keep the story simple, I went to Le Cirque with a group of people and some members do not drink and have never drank wine before, and were demanding for fruity non-alcoholic drinks, which is just about the most embarrassing thing that one can do in a fine dining restaurant particularly French. And most importantly, we were generally quite underdressed, which undoubtedly gave off the impression that we were some locals from California that visited Vegas for the first time. For an upscale French restaurant, this could tilt the waiters to act with more contempt, and one cannot reason why this is happening. To my surprise, and different from my previous experiences in situations like this in a fine dining restaurant, the waiters, including the manager, were totally unpretentious and treated us with great attentiveness. This may not sound like nothing much to anyone else, but this contributed quite largely to my pleasant experience at Le Cirque.  I disagree with many people who mentioned that Le Cirque was surreally, or extremely expensive. If you are in Vegas, most places are extremely overpriced with less than decent food. You are expected to pay more anywhere you go unless you go to fast food restaurants. I would like to say that Le Cirque is not overly priced for what it offers. Given that they serve top class French course meal, with the Bellagio fountain view, and an interior that is arguably the most romantic in Las Vegas, I believe that people are getting just about what they are paying for. Don't forget that this is Vegas, people.   The restaurant itself is quite small, the ambience of the restaurant is warm and intimate. The degustation course that we had was phenomenal and every course was an excitement, a reason to live and die for, and titillating (not a good choice of word here) to the taste buds. I went with the Le Cirque Lobster salad, sauteed Foie Gras with white chocolate & raison brioche, paupiette of Loup de Mer (a sea bass interpreted differently), and Wagyu Kobe beef tenderloin, finished off with Creme Brulee Le Cirque. As you can see in the pictures, they are quite amazing, not only in presentation, but how tasteful and memorable each dish was. Even the plates, utensils were beautiful, making it more pleasing to the eyes. I must say that what amazed me the most was their selection of desserts. Every single one of them is fantastic. Our table ordered every single one, and shared all of them. I'm not gonna lie, it was a party.   I am glad that I had a chance to go to Le Cirque and if I go back to Vegas with my beloved one, I would love to go again. Please be sure to make reservations before you make the trip though. It would be very sad if I had your hopes up and then you found out the restaurant was fully booked week after another.",

When we dined here, I happened to be seated near a window looking out at the Bellagio fountains, which was a lovely view to have, but I would have been equally happy facing the restaurant's interior. The ceiling is exquisitely decorated with colorful fabric, reminiscent of a circus tent (thus the name).   The service was really top-notch, with several different people attending to us during the dinner. Besides our attentive waiter, we had a sommelier, pastry chef, and of course, busser and food runner.   Everything we had for dinner at Le Cirque was amazing. We had a complementary palette-cleansing smoked salmon appetizer, a hamachi/cucumber/ponzu/avocado appetizer, sea bass (and another fish dish) for the main course, and several different dessert items, including a tray of pastries complementary from the chef. I was also given a complementary box of chocolates to take home.  Overall, fantastic experience!",

We had the Degustation Menu for $135pp not including some of the other additional price items so closer to $200 total for the bill. Although there were some great elements in some dishes, others were just OK. I would consider just the pre-fixe menu.  Of the menu, the Japanese yellow tail, and risotto were my top picks. I loved the desserts choices - the souffle was so yummy! My favorite pieces from the entire meal were the complementary ones - the laser cut egg and the little pineapple bursts were delicious.   I was a fan of the overall experience, but more so for a one time thing since there are many other options on the strip.",

It was so full of flavor, rich and creamy with bursts of lemon to cut through the creaminess, it was to die for! I highly highly recommend this dish! We had the deconstructed cheesecake and chocolate sphere for dessert - yes so much food! I don't remember the champagne cocktail that we ordered but we went with the recommendation and weren't disappointed!   The meal ended with petit fours - macaroons, raspberry jelly and marshmallow ! Plus a sweet little present - a truffle box!   The service was excellent - they sure know how to turn your evening into a special one!   Also, try getting the seats next to the window if you are going there for dinner, you will get a view of the Bellagio Fountains!",

Our favorite was the risotto and the boxed chocolates that we received as we left.  However during our dinner, the staff was very distracting with setting up a few large tables behind ours. I watched as they counted table settings and shuffled chairs around; Apparently it was a staff effort to set up large tables. We also noticed that there was no music playing in the background and with a smaller dining area, we were able to hear conversations from the tables next to us.   Overall it was a lovely experience and I would love to bring my husband here the next time I visit.",

The food presentation is wonderful.   My favorite part is the chocolate dessert, they pour melted chocolate on a chocolate ball and it melts and opens up! Must see, must taste!

They treat you with the utmost respect whether you're a high net worth client or an average joe.  Food is 5 star no matter the dish and we weren't disappointed in anything.

The service was outstanding, the food was excellent, cooked to perfection with beautiful presentation. The atmosphere was wonderful, the staff was very friendly & helpful. Le Cirque has a very upscale old-school vibe, though the staff doesn't make it feel stuffy. They're all very friendly & attentive.   The meal began with an array of different pieces of bread. My bf is a gentleman & knows I love Champs so he ordered a bottle (or 2) of Dom. We both tried the 3-course Pre-Fixe. Starting with Amuse Bouche - 2 eggshells beautifully presented with a light airy mousse, which is the only way I can describe it. It was really good. After that my bf had ordered the Burgundy Snails. Although good, not my favorite. (I'm just not a fan of escargot) It had a nice rich, earthy flavor. We also ordered the Black Truffle Risotto, it was so good & full of flavor! We both ordered the potato crusted sea bass with braised leeks & a pinot noir reduction & it was phenomenal!!! Truly a unique experience that I'd highly recommend. For dessert, my love had the Raspberry parfait & I had the Caramel Brulee. Both very delicious!  And if that wasn't enough, they offered complimentary sweets filled with macaroons & other treats while my bf handled the bill.  After we were done they came to the table & presented me with a jewelry box filled with truffles. Truly a class act! I can't say enough about how fantastic our meal was.  We are looking forward to having many more dinners here. 5 stars for this place & all my many compliments to the staff.   If you're looking for a great place to celebrate a special occasion or a nice dinner, this is absolutely the place for it!  The restaurant is intimate & the service is amazing!   Thank you for an amazing experience!",

The service and all of the other courses were definitely 5 star, the food flavourful and expertly prepared and service efficiently delivered.  But it remains incomprehensible that a Michelin starred restaurant would even think of serving, and perhaps even improperly prepare, an oftentimes tough cut of beef to its customers. Why take the risk in serving a relatively inexpensive cut of beef in a restaurant of this renown? It should be acknowledged that the uneaten beef was removed from the cheque.",

    "text": "Disappointed. Sometimes it's not good to have a great expectation of \"supposedly\" one of the finest restaurants in the world. Perhaps the reputation, the history and the awards of the restaurant are blocking the fellow Yelpers perception of the reality. The restaurant is small which is not a bad thing BUT all the tables are positioned so close to each other that there is no privacy and you are getting this feeling of \"too close for comfort\",  rubbing elbows with the diners from the near tables and can't not help hearing their conversations. The decor is posh but too heavy for a small place. The colorful fabric covering the ceiling hanging low creating the effect of a circus tent is claustrophobic,   I understand it's purpose to reflect the ambiance of 18th century era of the French circus but today this decor seems just old, outdated and suffocating . The French windows are dark and too small to enjoy the wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains so don't expect a dinner and a show. The crowd .... no sophisticated foodies to say the least ...  Now the most important part the food. Yes it is good but not to die for, not amazing, not fantastic as it should be for the legendary place they claim to be. And what is with the pre-fix menu and no option a la carte ?  Are they pushing you to spend more $$ because they can't fit enough people in this small crowded space..? The presentation of every dish is impressive  but the service kills it, it is ROBOTIC with no personality. The staff moves around so fast that you feel that they are late for the train that is about to leave the station.  They finish their sentence by the side of another table that was meant for you ! I watched the servers at every table and it seems that are burdened with their job and their fake smiles are easily spotted. Slightly arrogant and slightly condescending... Hello...!  you are servers after all and not The Royal Staff Members or The English Parliament!  Ugh..! Please....!!! They are soooooo many fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas why waste your time here !! It's fine to be expensive but fine has to follow from the beginning to the end if your average dinner is $500 plus !",

    "text": "It took a little effort to convince three friends, married with children, to visit a restaurant that's charging more than a C-note per person for a dinner. But under the guise of it being a special occasion, coupled with the express written consent of their spouses, got them on board.  The $350 menu prestige was a bridge too far for them (and in almost any other circumstance, for me, too), but the 5-course degustation menu was a nice compromise. I won't bother going into details about the individual courses because the menu will change by the time you visit and the cooking is far beyond what I'm capable of judging in and of itself. As you can tell by the recent five-star rating from Forbes Travel Guide and the Michelin star it's held onto from those few years when Michelin was rating Vegas, the food is going to be good. I will note that the courses were pleasantly leaning a little more vegetable-heavy: there were daikon \"noodles\" in the scallop dish and a cauliflower puree instead of a starch under the veal cheek dish. Not only does this lighten the menu a little bit (not making you feel completely stuffed by the end of the night), but I think it also takes more finesse to prepare. Also, although it's primarily considered a French restaurant, there was Japanese, Thai, and Italian influences on the menu, too, which celebrates the globalization of modern American cooking. Finally, while I've had truffles before, this is the first place I've been where they were used to elevate a dish rather than treat the mushroom like an expensive garnish.   The food was amazing, and judging by recent reviews in the New York Times, exceeds the mothership that was a staple of fine dining many years ago. No matter how good the food is, (and no matter how many photos I took and menus saved) I'm going to forget about it eventually. Even recalling the finer details of the courses now, a week after our visit, is difficult. What's not going to fade is the memories I have of spending three hours with friends I haven't seen in years and the experience of sharing this well-paced and rightly-proportioned meal with them. How we were treated with the right amount of formality and with impeccable service. Sitting there at the end of this great meal and with a glass of Pappy Van Winkle in my hand and feeling the afterglow of a special night. That's what I'll remember.   Will Guidara, owner of Eleven Madison Park:  \"If you save up your money for something special, you can buy a nicer stereo system, get a nicer car, go to the theater and sit next to the person that you love and not talk to each other. Or, you can take a few hours of your life and create a memory. That's the business I am in: of creating those moments, of making the impossible possible, at least for a few hours.\"",

While the physical size of the dining area is actually smaller than I expected it's still quirky but chic decor. I made a point to budget and splurge on this place and it was worth it. I did a five course meal plus a wine pairing which tallied to be $250 (before tip). It was worth every penny. The food was not only delicious but beautiful works of art. The server and sommelier we were and charismatic. Even though this is fine/formal dining it was not a cold or stiff reception from the staff. Try the sunchoke soup or leche fruit with gold leaf and cavier if they are on the menu when you go!",

I only had two pieces of criticism:  1) Menu is very truffle-heavy. I didn't opt for the truffle-themed menu, and it still felt like every other course had truffles. The truffles were great, and they belonged in the dishes, but it felt repetitive.  2) For a $400 dinner, I want bigger portions. I know I sound like a pleb saying that, but some dishes are just sparse. The black bass was literally 2\"x1\". Take one bite, decide you like it, take another bite... and it's gone. I'm not looking for gigantic portions, but the entrees border dangerously close to hors d'oeuvres.  I still highly recommend experiencing this place. I give four stars relative to other restaurants in Le Cirque's league. Compared to any everyday dining experience, something this special blows it away.",

The restaurant has a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains, but the interior is so gorgeous and the food is so delicious that you hardly notice them. We started our evening with a creme brulee martini, which was perfect in every way. The amuse bouche was a salmon rillette and it was Heaven. I started with the beef tartare, which absolutely melted in your mouth. My entree was the sea bass, which was fantastic, but I will admit that my dinner date's rabbit was life changing. I finished the evening with the chocolate souffle, which is by far the most amazing dessert I've ever had.   I really wish we had taken the opportunity to return, if only for drinks. It seems like a sin to visit an establishment more than once during a quick trip to Las Vegas, but I could have dined here every day and it wouldn't have been enough.",

    "text": "I took my sister here for her birthday dinner and she was very pleased and so was I. This place is small (about 60-80 max capacity) so make sure you make a reservation. They do not have patio seating bu there are tables near the windows with a view of Paris. It is circus-themed, hence, \"cirque\"...but don't worry, they don't have clowns walking around!  I almost ordered from the degustation menu when  my sister pointed out that my favorite escargot isn't included in that menu. So we both each got an appetizer, entree and dessert instead. My sister wanted to get the sea urchin but their shipment got stuck at the airport due to weather conditions.  Spiced Pumpkin Cappuccino with Warm Gougere: A frothy pumpkin soup with a small cheese pastry. Just a few sips and you're done. Great warm cappuccino and the gougere was tasty. 4/5  Escargots au Beurre d'Ail: Burgundy snails in garlic herb butter with confit tomato, croutons and Parma prosciutto. One of my favorite things is escargot. Generous portion of garlicky buttery and slightly crisp escargot. I was dipping my bread in garlic butter after I was done with the escargot. 5/5  Hamachi: Yellowtail marinated in citrus with avocado, heart of palm, cucumber and orange blossom smoke. The presentation was very nice. Orange blossom smoke coming from the bottom of the plate. The hamachi is fresh. 5/5  Filet de Loup de Mer: Potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass with braised leeks and Pinot Noir reduction. One of Le Cirque's classic dishes. The crust was so light but slightly crisp. The Pinot Noir reduction was amazing with the fish. 5/5  Degustation de Porc Berkshire: Pork chop, soy-glazed pork belly, butternut squash puree, truffled haricots tarbais, marjoram cider cream sauce and chestnut confit. The highlight of this dish was the pork belly - it was tender and melts in your mouth. 5/5  Petite Boule de Chocolate, Eclats de Noisette Caramelisee, Glace Chocolat Blanc: Chocolate ball with praline mousse, hazelnut caramel crunch, white chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce. You get a ball of chocolate with gold leaf on top and your server will pour hot chocolate over the chocolate ball causing it to melt parts of it and exposing the hazelnut crunch and ice cream. 5/5  Foret Noir dans sa Boule de Sucre, Cerises Morello en Kirsch, Cacao Sorbet: Black Forrest crumble in sugar sphere, cocoa sorbet and Morello cherries in Kirsch. This was my sister's choice for dessert since she likes black forest. The presentation was fantastic. You get a red ball made of sugar and inside it is all the goodies. The cherries were a bit too bitter and medicine-like for me so I didn't like this dessert but then again, this was not my choice. If you like black forest then you'd probably like this.  Petit Fours: Chocolate with gold leaf, marshmallow, lemon blueberry and profiteroles. My favorites were the chocolate and the profiteroles. 4/5  We were each given souvenir truffles. Service was good. Bread service includes: pretzels, baguette, rosemary and feta, bacon and cheddar, etc. and they'll give you unsalted and salted butter. Overall, it was a great dining experience.",

Cute dishes with their name on it and the walls of the dining room are adored with circus primates on each screen (monkeys and chimps) with a tent celining.  If you ask for a window view, you can see the Bellagio fountains.  The amuse bouche was this delicious chopped tartare of fish.  Hubby paid extra for the authentic Japan-raised Wagyu beef sold by the oz.  He got 5 oz. We both agreed that's one of the best tasting cuts of meat we've ever tried and they cooked it just perfectly.  The outside was seared and crunchy and the meat was very tender. He thought it practically melted in your mouth. I wouldn't go as far as that to say it melted, but it could easily be consumed by someone without teeth and had to gum it.    I had an appetizer of Yellowtail hamachi, thin slices of fish which was tender and I could've eaten more of it. My entree was a Mediterranean seabass surrounded in a potato crust.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  Dessert was a wonderful milk chocolate souffle'. The souffle' was fluffy and soft served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cream anglaise.    Hubby had a very tender foie gras appetizer.  His dessert of lychee ice cream with raspberry was also very good.  They offered 5 different slices/rolls of bread but we tried 3:  French, a great chedder bacon roll and chocolate/coffee which could've been dessert by itself.   Just really good food and if not for the hefty price tag, I'd eat there every night in Vegas and get really fat.",

    "text": "For my birthday meal I wanted to try some of the food that you always hear about on cooking and travel shows but never want to spend the money.  I found the 5 course meal that had everything I wanted to try at Le Cirque. The price is hefty because in addition to the 135 price the supplement dishes ($35 per ounce on wagyu beef, $40 extra for the black truffle risotto, $60 extra for the caviar).  We decided to skip the caviar but opted for the risotto and wagyu beef and so glad we did.  With drinks and tips the meal came to almost $800 for 2 people.  Definitely the most expensive meal I have ever had to date but well worth the experience.   First, the staff are friendly and professional.  We arrived early and sat at the bar for drinks. Had a pleasant conversation with the bartender while we waited. The hostess that greeted us and the host that took us to the table were polite.  Our server provided exceptional service though out our meal. Pretty much everyone that came up to the table know their job and they do it well.   Second, the food.  Along with the 5 courses you are given different dishes in between to transition from certain dish.  There's a rambutan jelly and salmon mouse amuse bouche that's light and fresh.  1st course yellowtail was visually beautiful and it had so many layers taste and texture. 2nd course my bf got the FOIE GRAS while I got the risotto. Both creamy and flavorful with a great after taste. I especially enjoyed the foie gras and the richness of every bite. 3rd course was the sea bass. A flaky piece of fish wrap in a crispy potato.  Text and taste are both on point.   4th course we both ordered the wagyu beef. It was well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and melt in your mouth.  There was the complementary dessert ball filled with a tasty liquid that tasted like apple pie. Our dessert was visually stunning. The raspberry mousse was light and fruity.  The chocolate ball was rich and decadent and a perfect way to finish off the meal. Just when we thought we were done the server brought out some macaroons and candy jelly to push our meal over the top.   Final review, this is not a place if you are looking to get a heap meal. But you definitely get what you pay for and along with the food you get an experience.   An experience I look forward to doing again.",

There were 5 different menus making the ordering confusing.  We settled on the $105 prix fix with wine pairing.   Bottom line, the food was delicious but the entire service and seating process seemed too mechanical.  We will not return.",

We had a wonderful amuse bouche of wild mushroom soup, which was followed by my least favorite course. As an appetizer I ordered the uni \"sorbet\", which was actually a cross between a mousse and an espuma. There were no textural elements to provide contrast, and it was unappetizing.  Other than that, the service could not have been better, the sommelier was lovely and made wonderful recommendations based on my requests, and the presentation of the food was exceptional.",

Our table was next to the window so we had a great view.  The service is incredible and friendly, but the food, I've had better.   On the menu you will definintely find decadent choices with both appetizers and entrees. They also have an excellent wine list.  After a few questions about the menu we ordered.  Our appetizers arrived. I had the crab salad, which was a lite salad topped with hearts of palm, caviar and spinkled with pomegranate seeds. Nice and fresh tasting. One of the ladies in my party had the fois gras which she said was very good, another - escargot which she said was good. However 2 of us got the lobster and avocado salad, which the lobster was so tough it was hard to cut.  When we mentioned it to our server, two men came back to our table, one remarked it must be our knife. (Really? not the response I expected) Uh.. no it's tough.. Since this is what I ordered for my entree, I asked if I could change my order to the Hamachi, they said no problem.   Our entrees came, two of the ladies did enjoy their sea bass and black bass. However the sea bass presentation could have been better, It was wrapped in potato with a brown sauce.. (brown & white only on a plate, not too appetizing) Another ordered venison, which she said was good, and another had the lobster risotto which she said was great.  The himachi I had was good, it sait on two pieces of avocado which were topped with rock salt, which was a bit much. Again it had heart of palm which was great.   They do say save the best for last and it was with dessert. I didn't order anything but 3 of the women got the chocolate ball, which I tasted. Rich dark chocolate poured over 3 to 4 different decadant chocolates. Beautiful presentation.   Again, the atmosphere nice, the service great, but the food?? For the price, I expected it to be one of the best meals I've ever had. With melt in your mouth food.  Unfortunately, I've had better.",

Not only was the decor lovely and interesting, we enjoyed the dancing fountains every 15 minutes through the windows at the Bellagio Hotel (where the restaurant is located). The staff was abundant and attentive. Even though it was a busy evening, they took time to chat with us about the food, the wine and the environs, along with info about the other locations throughout the world.  Each course was exquisite in its presentation, its combination of interesting food choices, and of course the mix of amazing flavors. Such a delightful evening for the palate and all the senses!  I had the venison which came in two medallions impeccably flavored and presented with savory accompaniments. No gaminess there, as we found out their venison is raised in New Zealand especially for their restaurants and is not the kind of deer you would see wandering around the US.   I could on & on about the food, but it is something you should experience for yourself if you get a chance. Although we dressed nicely, there was a more relaxed dress code than the New York restaurant. The guests around us were also friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time there. All in all, worth every penny - and more - for the wonderful experience.",

Afterwards we bounce around - sharing plates of foie gras, truffled pasta (white or black depending on season,) Kobe beef, scallops, escargot.  So delicious!!!

I ended up doing a different menu as I felt the pre-theater dinner was too restrictive. However, I was disappointed to see that the portions were the same as mine even though I was told they would be smaller on the pre-theater menu.   I had the lobster salad which I had read raves about on here. Truthfully, I thought it was kinda 'meh'... nothing special.  I tasted my friend's lobster bisque from the pre-theater menu and thought that was much better.  I had upgraded to the beef w/fois gras and it was good, but again, nothing special even with fois gras on top --of which there was very little I might add. Even my dessert -- a young cocount with sorbet and pineapples was very lackluster. It looked kinda cool coming out in the coconut but you can't taste the coconut cuz it's hard so it's really just sorbet w/some pineapple chunks. I wouldn't recommend it.   All in all I think it was an okay meal but not of the caliber I expected based on the notoriety of the NYC Le Cirque. With so many good food options in Las Vegas, I doubt I'd ever go back here.",

We had reservations for right after the show. My party of six were dressed in our finest fabric and don't you forget to because this place has a dress code. All the servers were in fine tailored suits. Upon observation that all the servers were male, I asked our ginger server why this was the case, he said that male servers were more aggressive in serving the cliente but that there were two female servers, one on maternity leave and one was cut when the restaurant down sized it staff. He said there were 3 rules to working there:  1) Don't steal 2) Don't make mistakes  3) Don't call in sick  Point taken, I'm hiring all males for my restaurant. ;)  The menu is quite confusing, especially the gustation taste menu. You get many choices and some no choice at all. The items are separated by a maroon & symbol or an \"or\". Regardless, ask for help and clarification...you end up getting a six course meal, given the little oyster bonus they bring out.  The lobster salad was refreshing, the sauteed foie gras rich decadence, the seabass was in excess, I could have done without, the duck was outstanding, and the train desserts were heavenly. We played musical desserts at our table. And they also gave the women in our group parting boxes of chocolate truffles!",

If you're getting married, engaged, or dying, you have an excuse to go here. If you're ridiculously wealthy and out to prove it, you have an excuse to go here. If you're an individualist who wants to rebel against your bank statement, you have an excuse to go here.   If you're out for the food and the ambiance, though, save your money and put it towards a meal at Picasso (if it's open), or any one of the other dozens of very fine restaurants in Vegas.   Regarding my own meal: My Sea bass had very flavorful leeks with it (absolutely delicious), but the fish itself was bland, bland, bland. Wine pairings were all very good, from the Chablis to the Oregon Pinot Noir that the sommelier will go to heaven for choosing. Dessert came in a fountain (6 different desserts for 6 different people) and every single one was absolute bliss.   So I guess if you want to try it out, go for a cocktail and a dessert (if that's allowed). Can't really go wrong with a souffle and Fernet Branca, no matter where you're dining.",

The room is small without seeming to be cramped. There is a delightful view of the fountains from most of the tables. From drinks in the bar to the dessert jewelry box as a parting gift everything was delightful. Their cocktails were delicious and not too expensive. I wish we had come earlier to try a few more. The staff was impeccable. Our waiter was especially amazing. The amouse bouche was a delicious salmon rillette severed on a beautiful platter. The selection of house baked breads was impressive. The coffee one was sinful.  I started with the escargot. They were delicious with an excellent texture contrast with the other ingredients in the dish. I had the Rabbit 3 ways for my main. The ravioli was a delight and the tenderloin was succulent. The pasta was also quite good. For dessert we had the Chocolate Sphere and the Souffle. The sphere was good but the Souffle stole the show. It was paradise. The macaroons and fruit jellies were a delightful tray with the bill. The truffle jewelry box was a beautiful and delicious souvenir of the experience.",

    "text": "Still fresh in my mind from our Valentines dinner.  Been almost 10 years since I've been to Le Cirque, so we decided to come back.  Had one of the later seatings, so the restaurant wouldn't be that busy, and got lucky with a window seat for fountain view.  The restaurant is a bit off to the side and kind of water level, so it isn't a great view; but having see the fountains a million times, whatever... :P  Beautiful dining room though, I had forgotten the ambiance of sitting under a colorful circus tent. :)  Set menus for every one that night, so we just picked an assortment of goodies from the menu.  I'll try to recall them, but some of the things are more memorable than others.  I had dinner with the wine paring, wife got a coke and the kobe addon.  Amuse - foie gras mousse.  Interesting presentation and just enough for a table spoon full of flavor.  Good starter.    Appetizers -  - snow crab salad with turnip and caviar - very tasty.  little pomegranates for extra burst of citrusy flavor.  paired with Ruinart blanc de blanc - not a huge champagne fan, but this glass was excellent.  - deconstructed baked potato - meh.  wife said it was mostly prosciutto and some creme fraiche and a tiny block of potato.  she ate mostly from my plate.   - sea urchin capellini - very yummy noodles, but I think the uni was either bad or something...ULTRA bad fishy taste.  I almost sent it back...but decided to just scrape off the uni and eat the noodles.  paired with Puligny-Montrachet chardonnay; i've never had a chardonnay from outside of California, so this was an eye opener for me.  nice muted pear flavors to go with the noodles.  - pan seared foie gras with pear and roasted almonds.  very yummy.  i tried to steal this from the wife and got some nasty looks. :)  Fishies -  - paupiette of sea bass - very tender and flavorful.  the pinot reduction made this a rockstar dish.  used to sea bass being miso/asian flavored, so this was a good change of pace.  - crispy blackened bass with artichoke sauce.  awesome, awesome dish.  was one of my favorite moments of the night.  nice subtle bass flavored in with a crunchy of the skin and the creamy artichoke sauce.  probably one of the best fish dishes i've ever had.  little odd that it was paired with a light french pinot from Nuits St Georges though...but still yummy!  Main -  - new zealand venison, broccolini, brussels sprout, date beignet.  very tender cuts of venison, no gamey taste to it.  almost like a nice veal, but nothing like the wife's kobe.  paired with chateau giscour.  - a5 kobe, truffle potato puree, shishito pepper.  what is there to say about this dish besides that it's really, really good.  nice cut of beef, well seasoned, perfect with little slivers of shishito pepper.  Desserts - memorable because both of them were in the shape of spheres.  the chocolate ball was melted with cocoa sauce, which made for an amazing presentation.  yuzu ball was also cool looking, but wasn't quite so yummy.  the sauternes also tasted like cheap Albertson's alcohol, so didn't really have much after the first sip.  Over all though, another great experience at Le Cirque, good food, great service, and some funny one-liners from the wine sommelier. :)",

    "text": "Disappointed.  We enjoy a lot of high end restaurants, but were disappointed with our evening at Le Cirque.  Ordered the tasting menu w/ wine pairings.  Food was good, not great.  Wine pairings started off great, but last two were very much misses (maybe because they weren't selected/poured by the somm himself, who was awesome?)  Truly, this is the first bad experience I've had ordering tasting menu w/ pairings from a high end restaurant.  Typically that's the best route to go to allow the chef/somm to show off their best work.  I guess they don't feel they have to prove themselves here anymore?  Service was polished and people were nice.  Lots of guests underdressed, but I guess that's Vegas.",

    "text": "Amazing service and unforgettable decor. Le Cirque is like stepping onto a stage. The walls are painted artistically in dramatic shades of orange, red, and jewel tones. The high ceilings are made of drawn up fabric that looks like you're inside a tent. Each table had plush furniture and there were whimsical painted murals of circus scenery and animals.   The dinner was an experience, one surprise after another. I tried so many new flavors in this one meal, enough to evoke a foodie inkling inside of me. I can't remember exactly what each dish was, but I tried white asparagus appetizer, a shot of some sort of green soup, an apple tartin, raspberry sorbet. I had a sparkling dessert wine and a red wine with my entree of truffle stuffed chicken. A standout was my appetizer, foie gras roasted with blackberries, apricots, and red potatoes. We were also offered complementary petit fors, which were artfully layered and sinfully good. I would recommend for anyone who wants to experience daring French food and likes the finer things in life! It's expensive but I felt it was reasonable for the meal that was delivered.",

    "text": "I'd give it 4.5, but it doesn't quite deserve 5 stars, so I'll settle for 4. We did the Degustation with the premium pairings. I'd like to mention that the service here is some of the most silent, effortless and efficient that I've ever had. The environment is truly over the top circus big top. Very luxe but with a kaleidoscopic hallucinogenic feel. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I can see how it could be seen as just plain gaudy to some. Our courses were all excellent, but the foie stood out and our Sauternes was exceptional, and should be given the pricing on the premium pairings. I'm glad we went with the upgrade. It was our honeymoon so they brought extra desserts and the chef came out to congratulate us. There are other places in vegas I will pick before going back next time, but it was a wonderful experience. I prefer fixed menus where there are no choices except if you wish to have the options and upgrades or not, but this does provide a little bit of control for those who don't like stepping away from the a la carte menu completely. The creme brulee also stood out, and I'm not usually a sweets fan. My wife was in heaven with what ended up being 5 dessert courses including the mignardises and gourmandises. Definitely a treat for those with a sweet tooth.  Highly Recommended at least once.",

    "text": "As I sit down to write this review, the delicate flavors of each dish are clear and emotive, like chords of a favorite ballad.  I found Le Cirque, as most great discoveries go, by complete accident. First, they have amazing service. At 10:10, they re-opened their kitchen to accommodate my late arrival and promptly whisked me off to a well appointed table adorned with fine sliver and roses.  A meticulously paced stream of staff brought my martini and selection of savory breads (the bacon roll and thyme roll really are amazing). Always off the beaten path, I dismissed the prix fix out of hand and set about ordering. I invited a few staff to my table to quietly debate their favorites, what was new, freshly in season and landed on two of their more simple dishes, the signature Lobster Salad and Poulet Roti Contiser a la Truffe Noir (Organic Roasted Chicken, Black Truffle, Macaroni au Foie Gras).   A stocky member of the staff with slicked black hair and the air of self importance shuffled over to my table, declaring himself the sommelier. I shared my order with him and offered that a bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay might be just the thing to pair with both dishes. Casually intrigued, his eyes searched the horizon for a moment then refocused with resolve. He smoothly made a counter recommendation, assessing me with arched brow. I smiled and slowly handed him the wine menu with, \"I am in your hands.\"  The Sauvignon Blanc (Domaine Girard's 2008 Sancerre La Garenne) arrived with the salad, an impeccable combination. The wine's crisp fresh notes and effervescent mouth feel were counterpoints to the richness of the lobster and peppery greens. The Chardonnay (2007 Husic from Napa Valley) had hints of oak and leather that seemed to embolden the seductive tones of the black truffle, sinfully appointed macaroni and lightly broiled chicken.  The off menu dessert recommended by the staff was a triumph of a raspberry candied basket nested with poached peach, creme fraiche, almond slivers and made popping sounds like fireworks. My desert had pop-fizzy candy in it!! That sealed my crush on Le Cirque.  Each dish left me wanting more while feeling completely satisfied and well rewarded for visiting.  Le Cirque, 4 1/2 stars",

    "text": "Oh my what a meal and what a deal. Me and the wife couldn't resist the deal that the pre theater menu presented. $98 with wine pairing for a 3 course prix fixe cannot be beat especially when the food and service is this good.   Atmosphere The circus theme is gorgeous, the lighting dim and pleasant, the music classy and quiet. The seating is very comfortable and the signature plates with the restaurant name on them are a nice touch. The silver ware arrives and removed every course. The napkins are a thick soft fabric and don't have that over washed bleached feel of lesser restaurants. We asked for fountain view seating and although you can see the fountains in this restaurant I would recommend just enjoying Le Cirque. It was nice being able to see a glimpse of the fountains with dinner but at the same time you couldn't hear the music the fountains were performing to so it was just pretty water at that point.  Service Wow, wow, wow, wow, did I say wow? I mean literally I felt like I was the only person in the dining room. While my food was in front of me and I was eating I felt like I was alone in the room. As soon as I had finished and it was apparent I was done eating my plate magically disappeared, my setting cleared, and my water topped off. It was amazing and just down right impressive the level of service provided in this place. It was our anniversary and they made sure to wish us a happy anniversary as well as have it written in chocolate on our dessert plates. Our wait staff was personable and great everyone was just stellar. Not only that but after dinner the manager personally emailed us and thanked us for dining with them. If I could award them a extra star I would without hesitation.   The food  Amuse bouche It was a small glass of tomato gazpacho with fresh veggies and a small butter pastry on the side. What a mouth watering start this was a complex flavored tasty little treat to start us out. The pasty was so soft and buttery it was a True Amuse Bouche in every sense.  First course Risotto Du Marche  Me and the wife both wanted risotto and boy did we make the right choice. It was a mushroom risotto with a blend of gruyere and one other cheese I cannot recall. This dish was hearty, flavorful, and just down right amazing.   The wine pairing was a crisp chardonnay that blended well with the dish and was surprisingly sweet for a chardonnay.   Main course I had the Salmon and my wife selected the Sea Bass.  My salmon was perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the top. I requested mine cooked medium and the kitchen nailed it. The gnocchi and vegetables were amazing and complemented the dish perfectly. The portion was a perfect size and was a much more filling dish then I expected.   My wifes sea bass was a more simple dish with the bass, a bed of simple veggies, and a pinot noir reduction. The reduction was amazing the fish well prepared and she was very pleased with it.   Wine Pairing was a nice pinot noir  it was a lighter pinot noir and was a very good match for our fish as it was not over powering.   Dessert My wife was given the souffle and was given the chocolate sphere. Oh my were these desserts exquisite. They were sweet, decadent, and extremely good. These are very rich desserts and I cannot even begin to embellish how outstanding these were. They also serve a assortment of small chocolates and candies that are outrageously good.   Wine Pairing An amazing moscato was served paired with our dinner and it was so good I am literally searching where to buy it. We love moscato and this was by far one of the best we have tasted.   Simply put if you are in town and want a stunning meal, great service, romantic elegant atmosphere, and even a little view of the fountains this is the place to do it.",

    "text": "How Michelin awarded Le Cirque anything less than 2 stars I'll never know.  While I haven't been to Joel Robuchon (the only 3 star in Vegas), I've been to the other 2 stars and this is at least as good, probably better.  I've been a member of Yelp for quite some time now, and this is my first review.  The meal was so good I felt I needed to share.  The Restaurant A wonderfully intimate, yet whimsical, environment that's puts you in the mood for a fun evening out.  There is a small bar area where you can enjoy a drink while waiting for your table.  I recommend their signature cocktail, the Veuve Framboise (it's like a really good Kir Royale).  Mmmm.  When you arrive at your table, you might even be blessed with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  The Service Le Cirque has mastered the art of constantly checking in on your table from a slight distance to make sure everything is going well.  There is nothing worse than enjoying a great meal with constant bombardment from the staff.  Each member of the staff has certain roles.  For example, only the sommelier refilled our wine glasses.  Nice touch!  Speaking of the sommelier, he suggested a great Bordeaux that was reasonably priced.  The Food No matter how great the decor or service is, the bottom line is the food.  Each dish that came out (we each had an app, entree, and dessert) was better than the last.  I started with risotto that had freshly shaved truffles and champagne.  One of the best risotto dishes I've ever had.  In fairness, this was a fairly expensive supplement to the standard cost but well worth every penny.  This was followed by a duck course that was prepared in about 3 different styles.  I'm craving a return trip just for this dish!  My meal ended with a chocolate souffle.  Shockingly enough, it was great.  ;)  I've been to many of the top restaurants in Las Vegas, and I can say that whenever I get asked for a recommendation for high end dining in the city, Le Cirque will be the first restaurant I mention.",

    "text": "I learned a valuable life lesson in my recent trip to Le Cirque - when venturing into the category of restaurants that go over $100 per person before wine, the return to the dollar diminishes greatly the more you go over that $100.  Don't get me wrong, the food was spectacular, the atmosphere exquisite. The service? Well, we'll get to that.   My husband and I went to Le Cirque for a blow-out meal on our honeymoon. I guess the first sign we were in over our heads was when the maitre'd replaced my white napkin with a black one in order not get get white lint on my black dress. Nice touch, that. My husband started looking at the menu, while I looked at the wine list. To my horror, there was not a single wine by the glass for less than $20. I did not see a bottle for less than $65. This, by the way, was also a bottle of wine I purchase regularly at my podunk backwater town's liquor store for about $18 a bottle. I get that wine gets marked up in restaurants, but come on Le Cirque.   Because it was a special occasion, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The first two courses were dynamite. One was an sea urchin with sea urchin foam on lemongrass gelee that I am still dreaming of. The next was a very lovely foie gras with rhubarb that sent shudders of pleasure down my spine. These were the last courses that I really felt were worth what we were paying.   The following fish and main courses were excellent, truly, and executed to perfection, but they were nothing I could not have accomplished in my own kitchen with enough time and money. (I am, I will concede, a trained chef.) We enjoyed them, and the presentations were lovely (a checkerboard of carrot and spring onion atop a piece of sea bass particularly springs to mind), but I have had more creative menus at far lesser restaurants.   Things got bumpy with the service when they skipped the cheese portion of our tasting menu and went straight to dessert. Once we realized they had forgotten an entire portion of our meal, we had already been served a (decadent and delicious) chocolate souffle and creme brulee. I politely told a waiter (not ours, we hadn't seen our waiter in quite some time) that a course had been skipped, and he did not believe me. My husband had to convince him that, yes, we had indeed ordered the tasting menu and, yes, a course had been skipped.  Now, normally, I would not have made much of a fuss about this. I am a reasonable person, I know how difficult the restaurant industry is, and let's face it, we were pretty stuffed already. However, when I am paying $135 per person _just for the food_ I don't think I am unreasonable in expecting almost perfection. After much hemming and hawing, trying to bring out the cheese after dessert (YUCK!), trying to give us the cheese to go (um, we're staying in a hotel room with no fridge and we're going to a show after this), trying to bring out those little red boxes they bring to everyone like it's something special (sorry, I know we look like hicks, but we're actually pretty sophisticated and won't be fooled that easily), the waiter brought out the maitre 'd who was one of the toughest-looking customers I have ever seen in my entire life. No wonder the waiter didn't want to tell him what had happened - he was probably afraid of him!   After more wrangling and finagling, my husband agreed to a $50 comp to the bill - the cost of our two glasses of wine.   I gave Le Cirque three stars for this. I remember an old review Ruth Reichl wrote of the original Le Cirque in New York where she went to the restaurant twice - once as herself and once as a \"regular Jane\" off the street. Needless to say, her experiences were vastly different. I feel, had my husband and I appeared more moneyed or been someone famous, our treatment would have been entirely different.   I am glad I had this experience. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about a level of establishment I had long coveted. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Le Cirque is just a overall perfect place to dine. As soon as you walk in you know your in for a great experience. It has a warm, dark, and playful room and I was seated at a perfect little table with a great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show as I requested! As soon as I sat down the manager came and introduced himself. Everyone had smiles on there faces and was ready to jump for the smallest request.   As soon as I sat down the bread basket arrived. Bread was nice and warm. It featured many different types such as raisin, wheat, pretzel and white. While most places give 2-3 different types this basket must have had 5 different types all in which were very good! I was then presented with a amuse! It was a Oyster topped with Caviar! This was by far the best Oyster I've had. It was as fresh as they come and the Caviar added a nice smooth salty flavor that was just amazing!  First Course was there famous Lobster Salad. The lobster was dressed with Black Truffle Dressing topped with some greens all wrapped up in a dill pickle. The lobster tasted very fresh and paired well with the dressing and the dill pickle just added the perfect amount of saltiness to it. Overall a great start and a tasteful dish!  Next up was the Foie Gras. Aw the sinful taste of Foie Gras. Some states have already banned it but Las Vegas will most likely always be the place to find Foie Gras and in MANY forms. Le Cirque's version was just awesome in every way. It reminded me much of the dish I had at Craftsteak. Sauteed Foie Gras with White Peach, Blackberries and Micro Greens. While Foie Gras itself is very rich no matter how the Chef prepares it, the White Peach and and Blackberries added a very nice lightness to the dish which I like when it comes to Foie Gras. Overall one of the best Foie Gras I've had.   Course #3! OK so I'm a full blooded Risotto LOVER! This was my favorite dish of the meal. It had LOTS of lobster which was cooked to perfection along with very fresh tasting peas. While risotto can be a hit or miss for me this risotto was the best I've had besides the one at Gordan Ramsay's at the London in NY. Everything was perfect. It was rich of course but not to rich which is why risotto is a hit or miss for me because most make the dish WAY to rich and cheesy. It was just perfect!  Course #4: The Halibut. This was my first time having this fish and after trying it, it will not be my last. It was cooked to perfection! It featured Halibut, Pesto Emulsion, Calamari Popsicle, Borlotti Beans & Tomato. It a had beautiful green color, the Pesto Emulsion, and this was definitely the best fish dish I've ever had. The Halibut melted in your mouth and all the flavors paired perfect with each other. This restaurant knows how to cook seafood and I think its there Strong point!  Course #5: The restaurant is known for there Rabbit. So of course I had to order there signature entree and I've never had Rabbit before so I figured what the hey! The dish is called \"Blanquette\" de Lapin in which they call Rabbit Symphony: Ravioli, Roasted Loin, Braised Leg with Crispy Spaetzles, Riesling Sauce! The Rabbit itself was good but a little dry, it reminded me a lot of pork but with the texture of chicken, the ravioli was good but also felt it to be a little dry as well. No flavors really popped and it was my least favorite dish but still a good dish and it was something new to me which is why I ordered it.   Palate Cleanser: To be honest I lost my notes somewhere during the trip so I'm not sure what the heck it was but all I know it was VERY VERY good, refreshing and light which was perfect before desert! It featured Coconut Sorbet with some kind of peach infusion.  DESERT: Chocolate Souffle! Perfect in every way. Loved it. It was rich and I was only able to eat three bites but it was good! First bite I felt like I was floating on a chocolate cloud with ice cream just slowing pouring over me!!!! And the end of the meal they present you with fabulous plate of petite fours, which I had them wrap to go because I was so full, and a nice little Le Cirque box which had some delectable chocolates in them and was a nice little souvenir!  Overall this was a AWESOME meal and loved every moment of it. The service doesn't get any better and was made to feel very comfortable as a solo diner. The manager came by throughout the meal to make sure everything was to my liking! The only negative I would say is they are to generous with there tasting menu. I hate leaving a restaurant stuffed to the point I can pairly walk. This place doesn't get enough credit and is in the same price range as many of the \"Celebrity Chefs\" restaurants which is why I think many people choose to dine at other restaurants just to say they dined there. If you want to be treated like royalty for a night with a ambiance and food that is just perfect then Le Cirque is the place to go!",

He was this snooty French sommelier who thought he was some hot stuff and gave us such attitude from the moment we walked in. We also brought in a bottle of vintage Dom and a vintage Opus One, which I'm sure he was pissed about because he couldn't oversell any of his wine to us. Beyond that, he didn't even let us taste the wine before he poured all of our glasses. The food was mediocre and the sommelier ruined the experience for all of us. Aside from that, the other servers were delightful but I would highly highly recommend that you think a few times before coming here for a celebratory meal, especially if you're a wine connoisseur and a foodie who values service and proper dining etiquette.",

    "text": "Fantastic food, impeccable service, absolutely brilliant dining experience.   I've sampled several other \"high end\" Vegas dining options in my previous trips but Le Cirque put them all to shame. Le Cirque is certainly expensive but I'd consider it better value for the cost than similarly priced alternatives (Micheal Mina, Picasso, SAGE, Eiffel Restaurant). I'd very much recommend the 6 course Tasting Menu (135) with the wine pairings (68 and 88 I believe). You can't go wrong with either the standard or the premium wines and they really are intended as an integral part of the meal. Some of the pairings are adventurous and wholly surprising (A red wine with the cod; a caramel, almost chocolatey, wine with the creme brulee) and I found these to be the most rewarding of the bunch. Moreover, the food is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing. Foie gras has never looked or tasted as good as when accompanied by apricots and chocolate sauce. However you should be aware that the full tasting menu is quite time consuming (at least 2 hours) but the staff is so precise and the new courses so well timed that it never drags. I realized that quite a few of the costumers preferred that prix-fixe 98 dollar 3 course option where you have the option of mixing and matching just about anything from the menu.   The staff itself is professional and courteous to the fault. Our head server described all the dishes as they were served with the precision of a mathematician while the head sommelier was wonderfully gregarious, telling us the history behind every wine in French (with a native accent, of course). The decor is charming and whimsical yet classy.    Strangely at the end of our meal, the head server for our table offered his assistance in  finding us a car/limo service, club passes, and show tickets. I've personally never been offered concierge service by a French waiter but I suppose a restaurant priding itself on the thoroughness of its service like Le Cirque might potentially offer such services.",

The additional paid for the lobster dish not worth it, lobster a little too rubbery ( having recently returned from a cruise to Maine ) Change of napkins depending on color of clothes ( dark or light), take away chocolate gifts for ladies, nice touches.  I'd probably try other similar restaurants in Vegas before returning.",

I have been to Craftsteak, L'Atelier, Mesa Grill,  Nobhill, and N9NE but Le Cirque outshone them all with their wonderful service and great food.   I felt it was a bit stuffy but our group was lively so we made the restaurant work around our mood. :)   The best part was the fantasy desserts for my friends birthday. The chocolate souffle is a MUST!!!!  Definitely go and you will not be disappointed! :)   Also, they give the ladies a tiny jewelry case and put truffles in it. the coconut one is super delish!",

The staff was incredibly attentive and informative.  Fred served each wine with a story and a laugh!  From the first bite to the last it was a memorable experience.  The yellowtail was touched with a kiss of citrus which is a taste I'll never forget.  The lamb was beautifully cooked.  Dessert was heaven!

Our perfect anniversary dinner was ruined by your incompetent staff:    1.Hostess who didn't ask for my phone number or if we were celebrating a special occasion when I made a reservation (so I had to tell her before she hung up)    2. Snobby server who, for some reason, neglected us the whole night. What did we do to deserve that?!    3. Whoever is responsible for my entree come out 45 min after I was done with my apps.    4. Manager who, after listening to me, said I should have waived him down earlier to resolve the issues with the entrees and our server! Whaaaat?     You guys have those five diamonds hanging on the wall, I shouldn't have to waive anyone down. Besides, i find it extremely rude. So we had $20 of our $400 bill taken care of. Please don't bother next time...Wait,there won't be next time!     By the way, make sure your servers know your menu because that Kobe filet is probably 4oz, not 8oz as I was told.     A good thing I can say about that place is that the sommelier and food runner were amazing, both professional, funny and very attentive. They are the only reason I'm adding a star.    Overall, how would you describe your experience when a very special dinner goes to hell and it still makes you really upset/angry/frustrated two months later?!",

I haven't dined much at French restaurants so to me the food tasted fine. My main entree was the foie gras stuffed chicken and it tasted great.  I called ahead to order a cake for the occasion. They will take the cake order, with your choice from their list of flavors, and the cake will be delivered to the restaurant and ready to serve at the end of your meal. The cake is $48 for 8 inch. It will be added to your bill.   The service was great. We were greeted kindly since the moment we walked in. Our waiter Martin , the only red headed waiter in the restaurant, was super attentive and entertaining.   At the end of your meal, they give each guest a small present to take with them.   The portions are small, but enough for us. Though some may want more food later on at night.",

    "text": "Here's another example of a True 5 star restaurant. Le Cirque deserves every star in every way. If your dowting me here a fact for you. They have had zero turn over since the doors opened. You have to be doing something right to have zero turn over. It turns out our waiter was not only a Broncos fan but a Steelers fan too, so am I.   From the minute we sat down we knew this place was different than any restaurant I have ever been in before. We really felt like we were special. The decor is all circusy and Frenchy. But not in a arrogant kind of way. We were lucky enough o get a table near the windows so we were able to hear and see the fountains of the Bellagio.   I wouldn't normally eat at a place like this cause it's way out of my league. But I have to say I would definitely eat here regularly if I could afford too. Food was truly amazing. Like most restaurants like this the portions aren't the biggest but what lacks in portion size makes up in flavor.  I really ate everything they put in front of us.   We ate almost all the restaurants at the Bellagio and this one was our favorite. They are all 4-5 star at the Bellagio. Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas with the kids so we can take them, it's that good.",

    "text": "Wow.  What an experience!  Was in LV for a \"Girls Weekend\" with my oldest friend.  We had tickets to \"O\" at 7:30, so were walking around the Bellagio looking at what our dinner options would be around Noon-ish.  Walked past Le Cirque and saw they were advertising a \"Pre-Show Menu\".  I immediately got on my iPhone to see if I could swing reservations, fully expecting not a cold chance in hell.  I mean-- it's LE CIRQUE.  But, there they were, was able to get us in at 6.  (Just 2 of us...)  We actually ended up getting there early (you never know how long it'll take to get a cab/get through the strip during rush hour) and they seated us right away.    This was one of the most elegant restaurants I've ever eaten at.  We opted for the Pre-Show dinner with wine pairing, which was an AMAZING deal at $95/each.  I got the Risotto to start and the Sea Bass.  My friend also got the risotto and opted for the Rabbit for her main course.  Everything was phenomenal!!!   Then, for dessert-- they bring us a mini silver tray with Petit Fours and a really large Chocolate Souffle and a small cocounut filled with a coconut-pineapple sorbet-- all for us to share.  OH MY GOD.  Just amazingly decadent.  If you have the chance to eat here-- go, go, go.  And as we left, they handed us the most adorable little keepsake box with truffles inside.    Thanks to the staff at Le Cirque for giving us an amazing dining experience!",

    "text": "Having eaten so many times at Le Cirque, I would say I am a bit of an expert.  I've had everything on the menu, sometimes multiple times, and I can honestly say that they do not serve even a single bad dish.  This is one high-class restaurant that has earned their Five Diamonds.  In fact, their sister location in New York City has been the haunt of many of the cities elite.  Ever since their opening of their Las Vegas location in The Bellagio, they have been a shining star in the Las Vegas dining scene.  The fine french style cuisine is separated into two sections on the menu: Classic and Contemporary.  They have a well prepared prix fixe menu, that I would recommend for the indecisive, but I have always just chosen my own.  One thing I would leave up to the staff would be the wine pairings.  The Sommelier is very accomplished, and knows exactly how to find a perfect match between your personal tastes and the food you are eating.  For those more interested in a liquor or cocktail pairing the Bartender is as seasoned and artful as they come.    Here are my suggestions for the Appetizer and the Entree, both for the Classic and the Contemporary  Appetizer, Classic:  Salade de Homard This lobster and fresh greens salad is in a black truffle oil dressing, and it is their signature appetizer.  It is crisp, fresh, lightly rich, and expertly well balanced.  A perfect prelude to a fine meal.  Appetizer, Contemporary:  Risotto du Marche While the risotto they serve changes once each season, I have yet to have one that wasn't completely decadent.  I believe one of the best I've had was the Wild Mushroom and gruyere.  Entree, Classic:  Cur de Filet de Buf When people ask me my absolute favorite food, this is what I tell them.  A large rare to medium rare tenderloin steak, sauteed foie gras on top, with little potato croquettes and sweet onion compote.  And of course, plenty of the reduction made from the steak.  While fine dining has a stigma of not being filling, this is one large dish that I have only managed to finish once out of the several times I've ordered it.  If you plan on it, get a salad for your entree, and maybe take desert to go.  Entree, Contemporary:  Magret de Canard This dish of Honey Duck Magret uses the natural richness and flavor of the duck to play with the sweet flavors of the Black Mission Fig, Apricot, Daikon Radish, and Cassis Coulis.  This is something that I would not only be surprised to see on Iron Chef America or Top Chef Masters, but even impressed.  With whatever dessert you find most fitting, they also serve a tray several small bites such as a mini-raspberry tart, dark chocolate covered almond slivers, and tiny meringues.  And finally to go, they give each party a tiny chest of drawers, with a chocolate truffle to remind you of your experience.  And believe me, if it is your first time or your thirtieth, you will always be thinking and wishing for the next time you will go.",

I have been to some good restaurants and I would like to give my compliments to Le Cirque, especially for being in Las Vegas. Because of the high tourist traffic many times the quality just isn't there at these fancy Vegas restaurants, not so here.   We had the Degustation Menu, or Chefs Menu.   Amuse-Bouche: Japanese oyster with salmon roe, very different, very good. First course lobster salad. mmm mmm mm. Served with truffle sauce and a few slices of black truffle. Second course foie gras with butterscotch and white chocolate? Are you nuts? It was AMAZINGLY good, hats off. Paupiette Le Sea Bass came next. I heard you can't even order this dish at le cirque new york, luckily its included here. The potato and fish were seared to a perfect crisp. Pinot Noir wine sauce deliciously complex. Second main course consisted of honey glazed duck. Get it medium rare if you like a bit more flavor. Candied pear was a perfect compliment to the fatty duck. Screw the $65 Kobe beef add-on its just a fad.   May I suggest a Lewis Vineyards 2004 Reserve to wash it all down with? This is a fabulous bottle, but you gotta bring it cause its not on the wine list.   Pre dessert was a delicious sorbet. Really cleansed the palate.   For dessert they treated us so well. They brought our table (of 4) four different desserts! So didn't have to.  Molten chocolate cake, yuzu ice cream, peach souffle, and a sort of raspberry sorbet. They served up some petit fours as well.   Everything was amazing and made with the upmost care and complexity. Service was top notch just like a good french restaurant would be. Atmosphere and decor are beautiful. Completely worth the money spent here. Cheers!",

We had a reservation for 6 people, all doing the tasting menu at 8pm. The dining room was half empty. Brett Michaels (yes, that Brett Michaels...) and some ladies walked in and clearly took our table despite not having a reservation. Fine. That sort of thing happens. But then the hostess left us at the bar for 45 minutes past our reservation time- no apology, no acknowledgment that this was incredibly rude and inconsiderate. She would only say that there was nothing she could do when we asked when we would be seated. The entire time we were sitting there looking at empty tables. We wound up making a reservation at Michael Mina from the bar and going there. Absolutely jaw dropping from this sort of restaurant.",

The atmosphere here is incredible. It is fine dining set amid the canopies of a circus tent. The decor of the restaurant is immaculate throughout and a majority of the tables have views of the Bellagio fountains. The service is as exceptional, it will exceed your expectations even for a fine dining restaurant.    Food:  Risotto du Marche: The truffle oil was liberally poured, almost overwhelming, but still really good.  Filet de Loup de Mer (paupiette of sea-bass, crispy potatoes,  braised leeks, Pinot Noir reduction): One of the best fish dishes I've had in my life.  Creme Brulee (Tahitian vanilla bean): The perfect way to end the meal, absolutely delicious.   Le Cirque serves the type of meals you will crave for years to come.",

    "text": "One of my top dining experiences to date! The level of service from the moment we walked in the door until we departed was exceptional. Warm, friendly, incredibly attentive without being intrusive. The decor and ambiance were both classy and whimsical without being pretentious. I ordered the lobster risotto starter and my friend had the pate...both dishes were absolutely exquisite, both in flavor and presentation. For our entrees, we each ordered the potato crusted sea bass, which is one of their specialties (in fact, it was the video on their website of this dish that convinced me to make reservations!) and it did not disappoint. The potato was perfectly browned and lightly crispy, while the fish was tender and moist. The wine reduction was so delicious...truly one of those sauces that you hate to leave even a drop on the plate at the end of the meal. For dessert, we decided to double souffle it, ordering both the banana and chocolate. Perfectly airy, not too sweet, incredibly decadent without being heavy...paired with our cup of espresso, it was a delightful end to a glorious meal!   We had show tickets for that evening, and the staff timed our meal perfectly, without ever making us feel rushed. One of our servers even stopped by to make sure we knew the quickest route to the show. Absolutely top notch service from beginning to end and a party for the taste buds for every single course. The 3-course meal was under $100/person excluding beverages, tax and gratuity, which I thought was more than reasonable. The portion sizes were perfect (and I like to eat!), we left full, but not painfully so, and stayed that way the rest of the evening. This is now on my list of 'must eats' for Vegas and I can't wait to return!  Ivo and his team are masters in the art of service and their passion for their art shows!",

    "text": "This was the best restaurant meal I've ever had, better than anything in my city. I've yet to visit Chicago, NYC, or California though, so I know it's only a temporary place holder. There's that identifying marker of a great restaurant where everything is perfectly balanced, not too salty, sweet, acidic, etc. I can only count a handful of restaurants that fit that bill. When we arrived they had asked us whether we were going to see a show, which we were and we had a 2 hour period before that was an issue. Since they made this a big deal, we assumed they had a system. We ordered the 5 course instead of the 10 course due to time restraints. We were informed this would work out well for our time limit. Everything went fine, everything was great. Then there was a giant lull between the third and the main course. Which was okay, because we had very large drinks and lots of bread and butter to consume. A couple that had arrived there an hour after us started complaining about where their main course was. There was a large 12-15 top there. Then they brought the pre-dessert balls, and we asked where our main course was. He apologized, and out came the main course, quickly after that the pre-dessert, the dessert from the menu and then then a plate of macarons, jellies, etc. In a matter of 5-10 minutes. All of that would have been fine, except the main course was cold. The A5 Wagyu that was $35 an ounce on top of the price of the normal dish itself was suppose to be medium rare, but was well past medium. It was all brown on the inside. It was still tender, but I've had hundreds of pieces of meat better than that. Even the Buffet down the hall's prime rib was better. The croquette was soggy and obviously cold. It became apparent that they had basically forgotten to server our main course, but we didn't have time to worry about it. Probably sat on the pass for a while. I'm assuming due to the larger table. Of course, we were about 10 minutes late to our show, where our friend informed us we missed the beginning that was the best part.",

We ended up going right down the hall to a place that had a better ambiance and wasn't so snooty. This place just wasn't for us. It's also really dark inside; there are places that have just as high quality with better seating, in my opinion.",

    "text": "Le Cirque definitely gives you one of the best dining experiences you can ever get.  Mind you, I said experiences, not just food and not just service because both are phenomenal.  I have also had my fair share of Michelin star restaurants, and this one is a winner in my book.  The first time I had it, I was with a group of 4 and we were enjoying each other's company but what stood out for me was the fact that I never noticed when they had refilled my water.  The second time I came back, we had a very intriguing conversation with the waiter about some of the people who come through the restaurant and we continued conversing with him even more after that.  You definitely will not get any type of service where they can give you so much.  That first part was just about the service alone and that was one of the best experiences, so let me get started on the food.  It is French food with very good combinations of tastes that melt together and complement each other well.  I have had the foie gras twice and have enjoyed it and have enjoyed the scallops.  I have tried many French restaurants outside of Le Cirque and have had the enjoyment of dining in France and Le Cirque is one of the places in the US that makes me reminisce about eating there.  The thing that hit home for me, given my sweet tooth, partially because of innovation and being one of the few places I found it, is the Boule de Chocolat (Ball of Chocolate), where they pour heated milk chocolate to melt a ball of dark chocolate hiding a hazelnut crunch and white chocolate ice cream.  I have come back once after my first visit, and I continue to hope that I will go back a 3rd time.",

    "text": "One of the things about being in business is sometimes you get a free meal and other times you get to pay.  Well I sort of paid for this one.  Went to Le Cirque with 15 other people.  Yes that is correct 15.  They put together 3 or 4 different tables and chairs for our rather large group.  Seating was tight but this is not a huge place so there is a trade off.  1) Salad.  Maine Lobster salad. 2) 2nd course was pate de foie gras 3) 3rd course for me was the duck 4) 4th course was the Kobe beef. 5) Dessert with 15 people there were 15 different desserts.  I did not partake in any but they looked fantastic.  What sounds like a bacchanal of food really was not.  It was very much a taster menu so each course except for dessert was 2 to three bites of food.  Out of all the dishes I had the duck was the best.  Best duck I have ever had or will ever eat.  It was cooked to perfection and the taste was mouth watering delicious.  The other 14 diners had a wine paring with every course.  Since I am a former drinker all I could do was listen to the sommelier tell everyone what a great choice each wine was with the meal.  I believe him after all he was from France and it is a French restaurant so if he does not know know who does.  This of course is a once in a life time meal and Le Cirque gave all 15 of us a once in a life time meal.  Oh yeah after the meal we watched O.  Kind of a slow night for us in Las Vegas....",

The room is small, but decorated like the inside of a (very classy) circus tent. The tables are kind of close together, but the view of the fountains made up for that. I wish the windows were bigger though! If you can, try to request a table next to the windows. The service is amazing, complete with multiple types of French accents.  I had the degustation menu. The amuse-bouche was a trio of salmon - each bite was SO good. For appetizer, I had the snow crab salad, which was served with flying fish roe, turnip, pomegranate, orange, and apple. I never thought these flavors would go well together, but it was absolutely delicious. The next course was the foie gras, served with a cardamom tarte and some kind of foam. This was delicious as well - unexpected flavors that went so well together. Next was the black sea bass, which was light but still had a lot of flavor. The last course was the suckling pig tasting - almost every part of the pig was served, and it was very good too.   I loved loved loved each course. I had some sort of raspberry bellini with Veuve Clicquot to start, and it was delicious as well. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. The degustation menu is $138, and the premium wine pairing is $88. They also give you a cute little box with chocolates as you're leaving. SUCH a good meal and an unforgettable experience!",

That always is a bonus in my book! Each course came out at appropriate times. They did not keep us waiting too long in between. The wait staff was very professional and engaging. One thing that stood out above the other restaurants I've been to is how beautiful it is inside! The colors, decor and lighting were my favorite.

    "text": "I must say, I've eaten at many fine dining restaurants across the world, and after living in Las Vegas for many years now, Le Cirque is definitely THE global standard for upscale French dining.  Yes, it's expensive, but it is definitely worth the money- you can taste the money you're spending, hahahaha, and I mean that in a good way.  First off, the decor is amazing.  I've never seen an establishment pull of a circus-like decor, hence its namesake.  The entire restaurant is eclipsed by a tent-like ceiling made of sheer fabrics of exotic yellows, oranges, and bright vermillions.  The seating is somewhat close to each other, close enough for intimate conversations but not space-invading to the point of intrusion.  From the moment the hostess led us to our table, the front-of-house service ran lack clockwork.  Greeted by the maitre d' and the manager, they were then followed by the sommelier who explained what kind of wine to pick since I was fairly picky about what wine I drink with my food.  Sadly, I don't remember what kind it was- all I know is that it was  Chardonnay.  The busser arrived with fiji water and the server came to explain the menu.  He should've saved his breath- I knew exactly what to order.  So then I ordered from the prix fixe menu.  From the traditional side, I started off with escargot.  I've tasted it before, but I wanted to taste it from a French chef.  It was amazing.  It was like nothing I've ever tasted.  The texted was soft and slightly slimy, but that's because of the juices that the escargot was served with.  My buddy got foie gras (yes, I know, we wanted to go all-out French), and it was also very good.  It didn't taste like typical liver of any sort, but it was definitely a taste that few could appreciate.  For the main course, I got a plate of different sorts of seafood- it had a leg of a crab, scallops, and other crustacean stuff.  It was fairly small- I think the escargot was actually bigger, but no matter- it was still amazing.  I can't remember what dessert I had, probably because it didn't taste like anything special in comparison with the appetizer and the main course, but I did remember the waiter serving us a tray of assorted bon-bons (French word for candy) and a box of truffles for each of us.  The synthetic silk box had two truffles- both very tasty, but the bon-bons was what impressed me.  They were all different; different looking and they tasted different as well.  I asked for another plate of them and they gave it to me in a to-go box!  What amazing service :)  All in all, this is an amazing restaurant.  This will NEVER fail to impress a dinner date, unless she's eaten at somewhere ridiculous like a French restaurant on top of the Pyrenees during springtime with an accordion player playing tableside on the cobblestone street, lavender aromas from the fields nearby grazing your nose while complimenting the taste of your.. bouillabaisse.. straight from the Mediterranean.  So unless you can find that here in Las Vegas, it's best to just stick to the next best thing.",

    "text": "I consider this place a solid 4.. maybe even a 4.5!  Service was fabulous. The restaurant has a unique look to it with fabric draped over the ceiling and circus related paintings on the walls.  It was definitely a nice dressy and quiet restaurant.  Before we sat down, they asked \"are you going to a show after dinner?\" It was to make sure we had enough time but when we said no, they were like.. great! no rush then.  Our waiter had the smoothest voice I swear.  He could run his own 'most interesting man in the world' commercials.   ANYWAY... on to the food!  The bacon/onion bread was tasty as well as the lemon rosemary bread.  DELISH.  The fois grois appetizer I got was good but a bit rich for me. I believe it was served with an Asian pear or fuji apple (can't remember at the moment)  and the dish the combination worked beautifully flavor wise.  It was a bit rich but then again, I had fois the night before at another restaurant so what do I know...    I got the duck entree and that was very tasty.  I expected it to be softer but the flavor was pretty amazing.    My friend had the bass.  OMG that was so good. It was wrapped in what looked like pasta but I believe was actually mashed potato.  I was pretty amazed.   I was ready to steal it from him.  The opera cake and the Creme Brulee were pretty spot on, too.  Portions are what I think they should be for what you pay for.  You walk out of there pretty full with a happy palet.   We got out there for about 100 a person I'd say it was well worth the money spent.  I'll have to come back again the next time I'm out in Vegas.",

The decor was vibrate and colorful, good circus feel. We were a party of 5 celebrating our friend's graduation.  The food was as expected from a classy french restaurant. You will not be disappointed. The Foie Gras Saute was delicious as it slowly melted in the mouth. The \"assorted seafood\" entree was typical, nothing too special. However, the desserts were something else. The presentation was spectacular (Had the strawberry sorbet contained in an iceball) and tasted just a little sweet, but you'll still enjoy it because you are in Vegas.   Overall, everyone in the party agreed that the experience was great, the food was well presented and prepared. Everything will meet your expectations from this swell french restaurant.",

I opted for the Edelweiss, which was pleasantly strong.  Words cannot describe the amazing dishes that followed.  Their simple breads were so delicious.  We started off with a salmon tartare that was presented with smoking stones.  Very good and impressive. The second course was a yellowtail en crudo which had flavors of citrus and avocado, delicately sliced.  The main course was amazing.  I chose the Dover sole which was accompanied by a small silver pot of steamed vegetables with a thin butter sauce.  Lastly, although I'm not a big fan of dessert wines, the Sommelier paired my raspberry souffle which was so delicious, with an equally delicious dessert Chardonnay.  Our friend, who was celebrating his birthday, was showered with a large tray of different flavored macarons and jellied fruits.  And, for the ladies, we were given a small gift of chocolates in their very own Jewelry box.",

From the service 5 star   above and beyond celebrity status service  yes we were paying top dollar for this service but it was fine dining to the fullest of its capabilities!!! The Decor is beyond beautiful. The atmosphere is quaint and not loud with the ringing of the casino in your ears . It is magical . The courses that are served to you are not rushed everything  tastes so exquisite you don't want the bites to end . I was savoring every bite  taking in the company that I was with . No waiter , or waitress , not even the table crumber  would move a muscle to walk into our direction in which made it the most relaxed dining experience I HAVE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!  Their timing was impeccable! The beverages came in the utmost perfect timing and were cold and tasty , our food was seasoned perfectly no need for salt pepper or condiments . If you are looking for a five PLus star restaurant to dine at with multiple courses to enjoy with good company or to impress a business associate to this is the place ! I lived in Vegas for 4 years and frequented the Bellagio often . I refer people there often and highly recommend that hotel and restaurant! The price is worth every Penney !!! Treat yourself !!!",

He seemed professional to other tables, so I'm not sure what his problem was with us. All the other servers were phenomenal, but since Martin was our main one, I felt uncomfortable the entire time. I just can't give Le Cirque higher than two stars because I spent my entire dinner being uncomfortable, and there are too many good restaurants with excellent food and service to have to suffer through bad service.",

My personal favorites was the burgundy escargot, risotto with morels, and the braised beef cheek covered in shaved black truffle.  My fiance ordered scallops with a coconut curry and... damn.

Very classic and elegant service, but their sommelier is very laid back and personable.  We had the 4 course Degustation menu and all the dishes were great.  We went with the crab/caviar upgrade which was pretty good, but didn't like the delivery system (eating caviar out of a blue crab shell was a bit challenging)...However my girlfriend was smitten with the alba truffle risotto.    Classic french food quite nicely done, and excellent service.  Can't go wrong there!",

    "text": "I came in on Christmas Day and had the Christmas Tasting menu.   It was a great experience, especially when it is to celebrate the most important birthday of the year... Jesus. Kidding aside, we were really there for a birthday.   For this holiday, you can only order the tasting menu. There was a choice for each course, even the amuse bouche.   Here is what I had and ordered:  The breads were ok, as they were not warmed and actually tasted stale. We had a late reservation, but that's no excuse in any restaurant.   The amuse bouche was Panko Crusted Farm Egg with Caviar. This was wonderful because I love egg based dishes and how can it not be better with a dollop of caviar. Oh and yes, the egg yolk was nice and slightly runny.   The first course was Maple and Balsamic Glazed Foie Gras. This is a dish that a French restaurant should have perfected and indeed, it was seared wonderfully which made the foie creamy and buttery with a firm outside layer. The addition of the maple glaze and balsamic added the sweetness and the acid to balance the gras.   The second course was the Wild Atlantic Turbot with Truffle Puree, and Black Trumpet mushrooms. This was a good dish albeit petite. The best combination was to put a dab of truffle puree with the fish. With just the fish or the puree by itself, it would have been lacking.   The third course, the main course, was Braised Veal Cheeks. Who knew Veal cheeks were so big? Just kidding, they were a good size and reminded me of braised short rib but more tender. What really took this to the next level was the red wine reduction and black truffles.   For all the dishes thus far, it's not about the main ingredient, it's about how all the ingredients on  the plate pair and compliment each other. There is a harmonious togetherness that each of the dishes had, which a lot of other restaurant have a hard time finding.    Dessert - souffle It's a 5 star French restaurant. They better get this right and right they did. I wonder if they would just let people come in for their souffle.... because I would be there every week. Um, just the souffle, not the tasting ;)  To conclude, if you like the more traditional French Fine dining experience, I highly recommend Le Cirque.   Note: The only downside about the restaurant is that the tables are way too close to one another. You can literally hear the next table's conversation.",

Make sure to block off enough time to really soak in the experience. Our taxi driver did recommend that we request a seat by the window so that we could enjoy a view of the Fountains.   Now onto the difficult part. Amuse bouche was... interesting. Rambutan with roe and gold flakes. I've never eaten gold before..which is fun to say that I have now. It was seasoned with fish sauce? Threw off my taste buds.   For the appetizer, my husband's hamachi was light and fresh. I had the Burgundy Snails (escargot) and...I'm not going to lie, it made my stomach turn. I'm not sure what went wrong. I thought in the moment that it might be too rich.. but I am also the girl that grew up in the south and I know rich/heavy food. I didn't touch much of this dish and tried to let the abdominal pain pass.  Main meal was perfection. Diver Scallops. Unfortunately, my stomach was still not having it and remained offended from the prior dish.  Dessert. The Chocolate Ball is a fun little show. Hazelnut crunch was my favorite part. The Chocolate Souffle was very light. I was very disappointed by the macarons.",

    "text": "One of the better Michelin starred rated restaurant I've ever experienced. I'm surprised it wasn't given a second star because I honestly felt that it ranked up there in quality and the experience. In my opinion, I had a better experience here than in Picasso, which has 2 Michelin stars.  Le Cirque is physically smaller than Picasso, and the theme is different too. Le Cirque has a \"circus\" feel to it with the murals of circus acts and I like the silk drapery that simulates being in a big circus tent. It also has some respectable views of the fountains too, that is if you score a table by the window.  The degustation menu is the only way to go if you have relatively no time constraints (2.5 hours) at Le Cirque. But they also have a smaller pre-theater menu as well. And with 15 somelliers on staff at Bellagio, getting the wine pairing is must.  The wine pairing was the best I've seen. And I only chose the somellier wine pairing. They have the more superior premium wine pairing, but I was already wowed with the cheaper version.  The 5 course menu was carefully and meticulously prepared. My favorite was the dessert. I chose the banana souffle and I would honestly come back, and just sit at the bar, and order 2 of these very decadent dishes. The best souffle I've ever had.  Again, I would rank this up there with restaurants having 2 Michelin stars. The staff was great. They entertained me as I sat there dining by myself. Such great hospitality. I will be back.",

I think our waiter was named Martin--he said most of the staff have worked there for 20+ years!! That tells you about how great it is to be there, and it shows in the way they serve customers.

Some of my favorite dishes are the hamachi, blue crab with avocado and caviar, seared scallop, and the foie gras. Of course, last but not least, you cannot forgot to end your night with the magical chocolate ball. The melted chocolate with hazelnuts and ice cream is truly a delightful experience. I highly recommend dining at Le Cirque, it will be a wonderful dinner. (Try to get the table where you can see the Bellagio water show).",

The Sommelier, our waiter, the bus-staff and the hostess were all incredibly friendly, engaging and professional from start-to-finish. They asked us questions, took our photo and seemed honestly happy to be doing their job... which means none of it felt forced. They didn't up-sell us and took into account our preferences when giving recommendations.  For the meal, I had melt-in-your-mouth foie gras, a hearty rabbit entree and a pear dessert. The chef gives you a little starter (which was a liver mousse) and a pallet cleanser (a little pumpkin ice cream cone) that were both fantastic as well. Our wine glass never went empty and we had plenty rounds of bread.  This was the most expensive meal we've had to date, and I don't feel bad about it for one instant. Absolute perfection.",

The inside of this restaurant is stimulating to say the least :P Such a fun theme.   Boyfie had planned on ordering the Prestige menu (10 course tasting), but it didn't seem at all better than the Degustation menu (5 course tasting) so we opted for that. I really like all the different menu options here along with the ability to pick each dish. Of course, we ordered 5 different things so we can try 10 things :)  We had: x MARYLAND BLUE CRAB  x JAPANESE YELLOWTAIL  x RISOTTO w/ Black Truffles  x SAUTEED FOIE GRAS  x MEDITERRANEAN SEA BASS  x HOKKAIDO SCALLOP  x BRAISED VEAL CHEEKS  x ROASTED ORGANIC JIDORI CHICKEN  x CHOCOLATE BALL  x STRAWBERRY PARFAIT  Favorites of the night were definitely the blue crab, risotto and seabass. Presentation was beautiful and the flavors were amazing. Really, really impressed with the menu here. The only downside to our meal was that our sommelier didn't seem that knowledgable. I was disappointed with this considering Le Cirque is such a nice fine dining establishment. Also, timing of the food was a little off. There were times we were waiting bored out of our mind for the next course...  Not the most upscale fine dining restaurant, but still bougie and fun ;) It felt more casual here, but that could be because of the decor. If I had to rate the fine dining restaurants on the strip I've tried, it would go 1) Joel Robuchon 2) Guy Savoy 3) Le Cirque 4) Picasso. This place is still a 5 star restaurant!",

    "text": "Le Cirque has eight restaurants around the world. Regardless of what one may think this restaurant is and represents, eight locations qualify it as a chain restaurant. There aren't many chain restaurants from which I would order a 5-course tasting menu and, had I thought of this before ordering it, I could have spared myself some disappointment.  As I nibbled on Le Cirque's sublime \"Bacon Cheddar Bread\" after smearing it with the restaurant's sweet, cultured butter, I grew impatient with the initial pacing of my meal. Like a reluctant one-night stand, things started out a bit too slow, and I began wondering to myself \"are we just messing around here, or are we going to do this?\"  My server stopped by with a gorgeous hardcover copy of \"A Table At Le Cirque\" for me to flip through while I waited. This was a coffee table book with photos, recipes, and stories of Le Cirque's history since opening in Manhattan in 1974. One unintended consequence of giving me this book was that it made it obvious to me that this wasn't the restaurant I was dining at. The restaurant I was in was a tribute band memorializing the legend of the original.  Once things got going, I enjoyed the \"Spring White Asparagus,\" and especially its fennel puree and salty lardon vinaigrette which created a sensational creamy hollandaise-like sauce when mixed with the runny yolk of the perfectly-round teardrop-shaped poached egg on the plate. As much as I liked this dish, I disliked the \"Hokkaido Scallop\" dish, which I paid extra to upgrade to, and possessed a strong, piscine taste that nearly triggered my gag reflex. When I alerted the manager, he merely explained how they source their scallops, implying with ill-informed condescension that their freshness was assured, and they could not possibly be compromised. I'll repeat: my scallop tasted fishy and spoiled and Le Cirque did nothing to address the situation.  The \"Carnaroli Risotto\" was lush and velvety due to its high-starch carnaroli rice (\"king of Italian rices\"), and then further enriched with butter before being mixed with spring onion confit and English peas, resulting in a hearty vegetarian dish. Shame that I got so little of it. One of the criticisms of fine dining restaurants by people who don't frequent them is that the miniscule size of the dishes results in a meal that's not filling enough - and this is usually proven to be an ignorant position, as my intestines genuinely ache after a degustation at a Michelin-starred restaurant like Le Cirque. Except that here the portions served are genuinely just way too small.  Nonetheless, there were definitely some delightful aspects to my meal. The \"Braised Veal Cheek\" was my favorite savory course, and maybe more for the mildly spicy kohlrabi than for the soft wine-stewed veal meat. The sumptuous combination of these two with porcini mushrooms nearly made me forget I was supposed to be upset by the spoiled scallop issue. If anything could atone for that gaffe, it may be the \"Chocolate Ball.\" This straightforward but first-rate dessert is finished tableside with a steady pour of hot chocolate sauce that would later mingle with a heavenly inner mixture of praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, and hazelnut caramel crunch.   Prices here are in-line with most other fine dining destinations on the strip. My 5-course tasting had a base cost of $135, which I upgraded from Mediterranean Sea Bass to the aforementioned Scallop for another $19. An $88 wine pairing was offered, but I was in Las Vegas and wanted to drink appropriately later that evening without fear of a breakfast headache, so I stuck with a couple of cocktails. On that, I don't recommend the \"Catcher in the Rye,\" which was 'booze in a glass' that would be satisfactory if I was gulping away my troubles at my local dive bar, but not so much for a $17 tipple at a AAA 5-diamond restaurant.   While service was fine aside from the failure to remediate the scallop issue, perhaps the biggest difference between this Vegas outpost and the similarly garish Manhattan location (in the process of \"re-opening\" yet again) is the conspicuous absence of ringmaster Sirio Maccioni, a celebrated maitre'd reputed to have an irresistible charm cultivated by decades of glad-handing the rich and famous of New York City. Without a personality like Maccioni's, the multi-colored spectacle of a dining room in a circus tent seems outlandish, as the staff here do not have enough volume in their voices or quirky enough dispositions to justify the surroundings. So too did the food have problems rising to the level of the brash, festive ambiance. Chef Alan Mardonovich, previously executive sous chef at Joel Robuchon, has chosen to play things mostly safe here in a contemporary French restaurant concept that begs for the bold and bizarre. I would imagine he's instead trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible. These are chain restaurant challenges.  Food/Decor/Service: 3.8/4.4/3.0",

Having been to Paris earlier this year we thought it would be nice to experience Paris in Las Vegas. This is a Michelin star rating restaurant my friend, with Michelin star prices. The prices range from $350.00 per person for a 10 course meal to $75.00 for the theatre menu which consists of 3 course meal served from 5-5:45. I was first overwhelmed with the prices, then overwhelmed with the outstanding service. The restaurant is very small and intimate with the decor of an old Parisian circus. Martin, Johnny and the rest of the staff have worked together for twenty years. The treated us like we were American royalty. We were so grateful to have had the experience in Las Vegas and hope to make this a part of our Christmas tradition. Cheers and merry Christmas le cirque!",

It is 100 degrees (and, with recent t-storms, 60% humidity) in Las Vegas right now. I live in LA and am here for a couple of days... to be honest, I didn't even bring pants.  Or shoes.  Pants are a fine requirement, if they want to make it so.  But in a place like Las Vegas, in Summer especially, that requirement is not obvious to me.  Even at LeCirque.    The restaurant's handling of our arrival was poor.  The staff fliply suggested I could just go upstairs, change and come back.  That would have been great if I were staying at the Bellagio (vs. the Venetian half a mile away, where my wife's conference was)--and if I had brought pants.  They also suggested that maybe I should try the casual (and empty) sushi restaurant next to LeCirque (because that restaurant apparently doesn't care about people wearing pants).  I've been there.  It's not really in the same ballpark; and I found it a bit insulting.  I am aware that this is a nice restaurant.  I have never been.  But I go to nice restaurants.  In nice cities.  And, if I were going to the original Le Cirque in NYC, I most certainly would have known to wear an appropriate suit (perhaps even with pants).  On the other hand, In 100 degree-60% humidity-Las Vegas--where I spent $700 on dinner for two at Nobu the night before (and wore shorts)--this restaurant owes it to make this requirement clear up front.    In the end, I found these people to be snooty jerks.  And frankly, LeCirque can't credibly \"put on airs\" that \"it's not catering to Vegas tourists\"...  at least to me, it's somewhat \"gauche\" for a restaurant \"of this caliber\" to bait $70 prix fixe dinners to fill the tables.",

I'd label us as \"amateur foodies,\" meaning we don't know everything there is to know about food, but we love trying new things. Dining at a place like this was a first for both of us, and I was a little intimidated. My fears were quickly allayed. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing. Formal, but incredibly warm and welcoming, not to mention humorous at times. They kindly explained how to read the menu when we admitted that we were newbies and a little confused.   We both ordered from the degustation tasting menu, and were told it was best for us to order different items so that we could try more things. We had planned on doing this in the first place, but I was relieved to know that we wouldn't look out of place eating from each other's plates, as this was the point. The food was just out of this world. There were a couple of things that we ate for the first time, and we were beyond impressed.  Our orders were: 1. Tasting of Tomatoes & Japanese Yellowtail with Hearts of Palm 2. Sauteed Foie Gras w/ Peaches & Burgundy Snails 3. Potato Crusted Sea-Bass & Seared Scallops 4. Lamb w/Sauteed Sweetbreads & Kobe Beef  5. Chocolate Ball & Gran Marnier Souffle   I also had the wine pairings, and Frederic, the sommelier, poured and explained each one personally. You can tell Frederic was not only knowledgeable, but really excited about what he did. This just kicked it up to a different level. As a whole, the staff made us feel like VIPs, seriously.  The ambiance is very formal, but also very comfortable, and the space itself is beautiful. As far as dress code, published dress code is dressy and elegant, and jackets are \"recommended but not required.\"  We were dressed up for dinner, and I think they appreciated that and saw it as being respectful of the establishment. One member of the wait staff told a story about a gentleman who showed up for his reservation in shorts. This said to me that they not only notice what you wear, but they remember.   As people who don't do this often, we were both just so blown away by the experience. And that's exactly what this is. An experience. Not just dinner. Yes, it was expensive, but for what we got, it was totally worth it. I would do this every day, if I could. But I'll just have to settle for pining for Le Cirque until I can get back to Las Vegas.",

Every other restaurant we walked in was at least an hour's wait. So we stumbled across Le Cirque. We were at the outlets before and weren't even appropriately dressed but we were too tired and too hungry to go anywhere and didn't care that it was expensive.   We got a table for 7 quickly. We had 3 hungry kids who only wanted pasta and nothing fancy and Martin helped make it happened. His service was excellent, friendly and entertaining and I was very impressed he made the grouchy kids very happy. He knew exactly what they wanted and they ate everything on their plate. My niece and I had the lobster risotto and it was the best I have had. My sister and brother-in-law has Salmon and sea bass and both were excellent too. Martin also recommended Creme Brulee, banana Souffle and Chocolate Sphere for desserts and they were to die for. Honestly, I was just expecting overpriced food with just  great ambience but this has to be one of the best dinner I have had. We also had a platter of complimentary desserts and I have become a dessert snob since.  I particularly want to acknowledge Martin for his excellent service. Everyone, including the kids, had a great time. If I am in Vegas again, I will be back.",

The desserts deserve a special mention - we got the 'circus of desserts' which includes basically all their desserts and you should totally do it if you have a big group - all the deserts were delicious and special (check out the picture of the yuzu cream and strawberry sorbet in a bowl made out of ice!).    Highly, Highly Recommended.  Oh yeah, one more thing.. we all left TOTALLY STUFFED - I know portion size is something people complain about at 'fancy' restaurants but that was NOT the case here.  We were all loosening our belts. :D",

Next to Umi in Pittsburgh (yes, pittsburgh) and the Four Seasons in Florence, I'd have to say that even with being incredibly tired from the 3 all nighters (yes, the bf and i are huge BJ fanatics) we still were  able to appreciate the decadence of this place.  I got the foie gras to start and the lobster with the king crab ravioli. Holy crap. The foie gras was melt in your mouth and was perfectly paired with some tartness so the flavor was amazing (and i didn't get overwhelmed by all that fat!)  The lobster meat was the most delicate lobster meat i have ever had. Tender and perfectly cooked, it paired wonderously with the delicious raviolis. The texture of the ravioli pasta was indescribable...   I went here 2 years ago and I still remember the experience!!! Now that's what I call a memorable experience!  A must-go.",

    "text": "Ok, so this was date night, extraordinaire.  I didn't even take a peek at the menu.  All was ordered for me.  Much to my delight.    The foie gras was to die for.  The fresh pea soup with a hint of mint and a little island of baked meringue *thingie* in the middle was delightful and refreshing between courses.  The sea bass was yummy.    So why four stars and not five?  I thought they could do better on the wine.  And this may be more MY issue than it is theirs but if the man is not ordering wine for himself and it is left up to me to \"try it\" and decide whether it is good or not.......I was uncomfortable saying that it wasn't.    Lastly.......I tried to be dainty.....I really did.  I gently demurred on the matter of dessert...but it was ordered for me anyway.  Creme brulee.  A classic.  Placed right in front of me.....there was not one bit of  will in me left to protest.  Perhaps that is what Mr. Date planned all along.  :)",

The tasting menu was average fare (at these prices, at least), and the wine pairings were downright pedestrian for this quality of restaurant....although the Hungarian sweet wine served with the foie gras was a dynamite choice.  At these prices, there are MUCH better places to dine at in Las Vegas.  Too bad Le Cirque is satisfied floating along on their reputation and not pushing the envelope a bit.  Keep this up and the reputation will suffer too.",

    "text": "Wow, what a disappointment.  My family and I went for Thanksgiving.  The menu was set at $145 for a set five courses meaning that each course was averaging $29.    The first course was a lobster salad which was decent, but nothing to write home about.    The second course was 1.5-2oz of parmesan risotto.  Also good, but nothing spectacular.    Third course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.    Fourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5\"x1.5\" square. When I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.    The only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.    This will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed.",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday tonight, and both the meal and the service were wonderful. There are a couple of tasting menu options, including 3 courses for $105 and 5 courses for $135. However, if you come between 5-5:45pm on most nights (except holidays), you can do their pre-theater menu, which is a more limited 3 course menu for $72. We opted to do the pre-theater menu.   We received the following: Bread basket: amazing. There were lots of delicious types of bread inside, including a white chocolate coffee tea bread (so sweet, almost like dessert!), a bacon roll, and a salted pretzel. The bread also came with salted and unsalted butter. Smoked salmon topped with panna cotta mousse, gold leaf, and caviar amuse bouche: a delicious start to the meal. The smoked salmon was flavorful and the panna cotta was deliciously creamy. The amuse bouche was served on top of rocks with dry ice, which created a cool smoky effect. Steak tartare with quail egg and herb salad appetizer: the steak tartare was fresh and high quality, and I enjoyed being able to pour the raw quail egg whites and yolk out of the tiny shell and onto the steak tartare to give an added creaminess. Lobster and Parmesan risotto appetizer: I liked this a bit less than the steak tartare, but the risotto was well-cooked and had a strong lobster and Parmesan flavor.  Salmon entree with asparagus and potato mouselline: I thought the salmon was a bit overcooked and therefore not as tender. Portion size was generous for an upscale restaurant.  Chicken entree with asparagus, mushrooms, roasted baby potatoes, and sauce vin jaune: the chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauce was thick, dense, and flavorful.  Sea bass with crispy potatoes, braised leeks, and Pinot noir reduction: I didn't try this, but my friends who ordered it said it was the best sea bass they have had, and their favorite entree. The basil and the Pinot noir reduction paired together in an unexpectedly creative but delicious manner.  Chocolate ball dessert with praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, hazelnut caramel crunch, and chocolate sauce: this was an amazing dessert! The chocolate ball is decently sized and the server pours hot chocolate sauce on top, which melts the outer chocolate shell and reveals the ice cream and praline mousse inside. The dessert tastes like a gigantic Ferrero Rocher! Raspberry parfait, champagne gelee, lychee dessert: another amazing dessert. The acidic raspberries paired perfectly with the sweetness of the parfait and the lychee.   Service was amazing. Our waters were constantly refilled and our silverware replaced. At the end of the meal, we were given complimentary macarons and truffles, which were the perfect sweet treat to end the meal. Overall, I was very satisfied with this Michelin star dining experience!",

Tonight I went with my husband, his cousin, and his aunt and we all enjoyed everything we had there. The ambiance is very special and the staff is wonderful. I really am impressed with the service at the Vegas location (nyc was very good as well)!  The portions were large but not overwhelming and of course everything was delicious.   This is what we ordered:  Appetizer: foie gras (2), lobster risotto, lobster and avocado salad.  Main: rabbit, duck for two, and sea bass.  Dessert: raspberry parfait, mascarpone and chestnut mousse, creme brulee, and sesame panna cotta.  I got to try a bite of everyone's food (haha don't judge...) and my favorites were the lobster risotto, duck, and creme brulee.   They even gave us a small platter of mini desserts on the house and small boxes of chocolate for the ladies at the table. So cute!   Excellent... a must try!",

We started off in the bar with some cocktails. They have some fun ones so give it a go.   We had the five course tasting menu. It was just the right amount of food for us. For our first course we had the yellowtail. It was a very fresh dish with crisp flavors and textures. It was beautifully presented and just the right amount for a first course. For the second course we got the risotto. This was a very rich dish so I appreciated that the portion was small for this course. For the third course my husband got the sea bass and I got the scallop. Another great dish. I loved the play on textures with each course. For our fourth course I got the chicken. My husband upgraded his steak to Kobe for an additional charge. It was so worth it. He said it was the best steak he had ever eaten. For dessert we ordered one of each again. I had food envy over my husband's dessert. He ordered the chocolate ball. My raspberry parfait was good, but a little too sweet. The chocolate ball is the way to go for dessert.   At the end of the meal the waiter brought out a few other treats like macaroons. We had just the right amount of food. We were not overstuffed.",

They serve fresh bread in various assorments: french, bacon and cheddar, chocolate coffee, rosemary, and pretzel.   First course I had the pea soup which was very tasty and had beautiful presentation. My boyfriend had the yellowtail sashimi and it had a very bold, citrus flavor that he loved.   Second course was foie gras which was tender and creative use of apples and caramel sauce.   Third course I had sea bass which was so tender and juicy. The wine sauce was amazing and my boyfriend had a scallop which was tender, delicious, and well balanced.   Fourth course I had lamb which was absolutely AMAZING. It was a perfect medium and it was juicy and full of amazing flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken and he thought it was well marinated and he loved the gravy.   The last course was dessert which I had Creme brulee. It was the best I've ever had. The tart was perfect and creamy. My boyfriend had a chocolate ball with ice cream inside and the chocolate ball melted as they poured chocolate over it. Also, they give four small french desserts (macaroons, etc) in a very creative dish filled with brown sugar.   We were also given a small tasting of salmon from the chef, and a souvenir box with bon bons inside. One of my favorite parts was the palatte cleanser. It was a nonalcoholic sangria inside of a bon bon or something and it just pops in your mouth and cleans it all out! It was a lot of fun, and it was an amazing dining experience.   I would highly recommend coming to this restaurant and I hope that I can come here again soon.",

Since it was in the hotel we were staying in. I have remembered being to this place before, LONG time ago with friends.  How can I forget, the stars on the wall right before you open the door to this establishment.    This resto has ONLY pre fix menus. We ordered the 3 course pre fix- appetizer, entree and dessert. I had the Maryland blue crab (which cost extra) He had the Hamachi.  Both were delicious.  Portions are small but savory.   Main course- Sea Bass and he had the 4oz Japanese Wagyu filet (also cost per pound)  OMG, that wagyu just melts in your mouth!!! Like butter! For dessert: creme brulee and ice cream.  The resto gave us macarons on the side.  MY FAVORITE! Pistachio macarons!   Ohhh and the view is great, you get to watch the fountain show right from your seat!   Overall, the food and experience itself was well worth that huge bill! You have to try this place at least once!",

    "text": "Very conflicted about the 5 star rating. We eat at an expensive restaurant one time each year on our anniversary. Kinda hard to keep that \"special occasion\" feeling when a guy at the next table is wearing jeans and a leather jacket. With everyone fawning over him he must be famous. We chose the 5 course meal and the wine pairing. First off, our Sommelier was the best I have ever had, even counting the one at Joel Robuchon. She went into great detail about every single glass, the pairings were perfect every course and the price was reasonable. Our waiter was professional and courteous with out being snobby.   Hits: Risotto (with and without truffles) Scallops Sea Bass Bacon and coffee breads Espresso (Best I have had outside of a coffee shop) Service (Everyone was very friendly)  Misses: Dress code  Veal Cheeks (the burnt looking sauce was a turnoff) Chocolate ball (the waiter poured too much hot sauce and melted the entire ball)   Best Ever: Sommelier Jidori Chicken - I was completely blown away, I have never had chicken melt in my mouth like that before. It was tender without being undercooked, it was moist without tasting as if it was injected with brine. I never thought I would go to a Michelin starred French restaurant for the chicken but I would order this again.   In summation, you can do worse if you have $500 to spend for two people. The only place we have eaten that compares is Joel Robuchon. Their food was presented just a little bit better but their prices are much higher. The snob factor is also higher there.",

Impeccable service. Devine food. Quiet, relaxing ambiance.  My only complaint was that the clientele who chose to dine with us there were uptight. There were a few times during our meal that I laughed a decibel too high (i.e., it could be heard from 5 feet away) and our neighboring patrons shot us nasty glances. Be warned, if you want to speak louder than a whisper, you will be judged by other diners. Oh and they don't validate parking. Bellagio has to be the only hotel on the strip that charges for parking!!!",

Daniel got the lobster risotto and the rabbit entree. As expected, everything was outstanding. Even down to their table bread and butter - so delicious.  I got the chocolate souffle for dessert - I haven't had a souffle executed so perfectly in years. Bravo.   What's fascinating to me is how many people (especially women) were sitting around here eating their food looking completely bored and uninterested. A waiter places a stunning work of art of front of you that a chef has worked so passionately creating, and it doesn't even warrant a reaction (let alone a smile). It truly doesn't matter how many times they've been here: Shame on them for not having the capacity to recognize or appreciate such a special experience that so much work and effort was put into creating.",

    "text": "Expecting to pay outrageous to try this restaurant out. A group of five us came in for dinner. One of the best values. Fancy restaurants usually mean small unfulfilling portions.  Decor runs with the Le Cirque theme on paintings, ceiling, and French style dining area. Visually appealing and harmonious to enjoy while eating.    Staff was friendly, helpful and prompt upon checking in for dinner. Wait staff was congenial and answered any questions about the menu. A good variety on the regular menu and prefix choices on pretheatre for the O. There are choices for the sensitive or dietary restrictions (allergies, vegetarian et).   A drink order was taken and delivered at a good pace with the meals. Water refills were consistent to enjoy the various aspects of our meals. We were fairly quick on our decisions with none of us ordering the same appetizer or salad, main dish or dessert.   Amuse bouche was served to cleanse the pallets. A nice cold soup. Refreshing it was and should be.   Staff returned fairly quick with a large bread basket of all types offered for our party. If you are dining as a couple the bread waiter will circle around the tables a la carte style. Good selections of not common flavor on taste buds.   The appetizers were served at a good pace from here. Amazement to the eyes and tantalizing on the buds. Some appetizer we tried include pomegranate salad, tartar, the seasonal risotto. Nothing was left on these dishes. The salad was sweet, light, and refreshing. The tartar was rare and tender to my enjoyment. Risotto was just scrumptious with the lobster. All good proportion to pair well with our each selected main entrees.  Some of the entrees we ordered include the roasted chicken, salmon, filet, foie gras. The entrees were paired with appropriate seasonal vegetables.  Each of us enjoyed the dishes we ordered. The salmon was cooked as requested. Topped with a nice sauce. Good balance. The chicken fell off of the bone with lots of flavor. The foie gras was so good (tender like a good cut of beef). The filet was cooked to the medium rare desired. Each of us were happy with our choices. The wine paired with the entree ordered was good. Not a bad choice. Healthy sized. Most of us were full at this time. Well portioned for a great entree.   Dessert was short to arrive from there. Each of us again elected to try something different from.   A hazelnut filled dark chocolate, raspberry lemon, and Creme brulee. Desserts each had their delicate nature but big on flavor. Most desserts were large enough for two people to share. As we were celebrating a birthday, a dessert platter of various desserts was also brought up. Little chocolates and truffles. So great on the eyes. The wines paired were distinct in taste.  The check and bill settlement was quick.   Staff was consistently, friendly, helpful, and  efficient. Food was well portioned, seasoned exceptionally, and thoughtfully constructed. Beverages were paired to the meals.   Good: everything.  Bad: nothing.   I would come back with no hesitation",

    "text": "I was incredibly excited to eat here during a recent trip to Las Vegas. We reserved a table for 4 at 7pm, and were seated promptly. The dining room is gorgeous.   We were offered and ordered a pre-meal cocktail.  At that time we met the staff and were asked if we had a show that evening. We said no, that dinner was the highlight of the evening.   Shortly after we ordered our cocktails we placed our orders. I was a bit surprised they did not offer to explain anything on the menu; however we were discussing the Tasting Menu so I assume they knew we already wanted that. We placed our orders and before we could finish our cocktails the first course was at the table. The Sommelier arrived, who was funny and cordial, to describe the first wine. The first course was yellowtail, and delicious, my husband got the crab which was divine. As soon as we finished the food it was cleared and nearly as quickly they brought the glasses for the next course. Again, I was surprised because we all still had half our pre dinner cocktail and at least half of the first glass of wine. The second course came, amazing risotto, and the speediness repeatedly itself again. Finally, my husband asked them to slow down because the course were coming so fast we were barely able finish our previous course and unable to finish our drinks. The waiter apologized and mentioned they were used to getting people to shows. We stated again we didn't have a show. He said he would take cues from my husband. At this point, the service switched, the sommelier came out for 2nd wine, but not the 3rd and despite my husband trying to signal the waiter repeatedly it took 3-4 attempts (understandably he had other tables) to catch his attention so it took almost 3.5 more hours to complete our remaining courses.   Overall the food was wonderful, I particularly loved my potato wrapped sea bass and souffle, but the pace of service was stressful and detracted from the experience.",

We had a wonderful time talking to him about food and wine. We also enjoyed the Sommelier's interesting choices for the wine pairing. I particularly loved the White Burgundy paired with the sublime yellow tail.   I took some lousy photos of most of the courses, I'll post those. I did miss a few because I was so focused on eating the delicious food. The Amuse Bouche was an amazing salmon rillette with a citrus cream topped with an edible flower.   We tried nearly everything on the Degustation menu, we shared all the dishes, which was fun. The foie grass pared with lemon and berry cream and served with a nice Sauternes. . I ordered the veal, which I don't often do, and I was not disappointed. It was stellar. It was served with a celeriac puree and paired with an Italian red that I've forgotten the name of, but it was nice. My husband had the symphony of rabbit with a nice Graves, also delicious.   The chocolate bomb dessert was insane. It was paired with a LBV port from Dow and it was out of this world. The chocolate is molten and there's a subtle crunch of nuts that reminded me of really high end version of Ferraro Rocher candy.  Hubby had some Kracher Beerenauslese dessert wine with the passion fruit dessert. Just fantastic.   I will return.",

In many ways a night like any other, Mr. Angelov only making his departure public that morning, it was with warm greetings in the foyer that diners found their favorite booth waiting, Carte Blanche as always the only correct choice and Le Framboise once again proving its mettle with housemade Raspberry Puree set afloat on brisk bubbles.   Always a mix of old and new, smoked Salmon beneath its creamy cap opening the palate to seven savories that would follow, it was in the form of a Salad that \"Heirloom Tomato Fantasy\" attested to skilled hands and quality sourcing, each bite a little different than the last with the Pickled Quail Egg and Cheese each memorable on their own but more-so for their contribution to the whole     Trying to go easy on Bread, always a challenge when Butter from Bordier is involved, course two featured creamy Rice topped in Pine Nuts and Truffles, Australia not Dordogne Perigord though the aroma is still prominent while a real taste of France arrived next featuring sauteed Foie Gras amidst Wild Strawberries and tangy Meyer Lemons.  Fond of the Liver from a visit in May, the same True of Chef Alan Mardonovich's Langoustine resting in Caviar and Butter, it was traveling back to Daniel Boulud's earliest days in New York that Sea Bass was served, the Pinot Noir Verjus never growing old though a new dish of Dover Sole a la Grenobloise was no slouch itself thanks to finely chopped Ratatouille and velvety Potatoes.    Happy to see Chef Mardonovich arrive tableside, he too departing Le Cirque soon, it was as Authentic Kobe Beef was described that Truffles were shaved, the fleeting aroma soon followed by beautifully marbled Ribeye and Goat Cheese Pudding plus a spoonful of Bordelaise.  Cleansing the palate with Blood Orange Sorbet, two Le Cirque classics and a seasonal Peach Parfait serving as Dessert, it was from an all-new box that Mignardises were selected followed by take-home Chocolates and a \"Bon Voyage\" to two men whose tireless commitment to excellence will surely see them taking their respective new Restaurants to previously unseen heights.",

    "text": "We came here for our four year anniversary and I couldn't be more impressed with the service here. Le Cirque has been lower on my to-try list since the location and theme seemed a bit dated by Vegas standards, but I can now understand why it has endured for the past 21 years.   Meal options include a 10-course prestige menu for $350 per person, a 5-course degustation menu for $135 per person, and a 3-course menu for $105 per person. For the most bang for your buck, I recommend the degustation menu, which is what we ended up choosing. From there, you can choose a number of supplements, of which I highly recommend the sauteed foie gras and the Maryland blue crab with caviar if you have exquisite tastes. Although you might be tempted to fill up on the chocolate-espresso bread and the brioche bun, save room for the actual meal.  Between my wife and I, we got to try a number of dishes on the degustation menu. My favorites included a perfectly sauteed piece of foie gras. Usually, foie gras is very fatty, but the combination of strawberry and Meyer lemon compote had the perfect amount of sweetness to cut the fat. The other must-order dish is the Mediterranean sea-bass, which is the signature dish from Le Cirque. Although, it might not seem like much, a perfectly cooked piece of seabass is wrapped in a paper-thin piece of potato served with braised leeks and a memorable pinot noir reduction.   We ended dinner with a giant chocolate ball melted with chocolate syrup to reveal a white chocolate ice cream with hazelnut caramel crunch. Service here was excellent as our waiters and were charming and humorous. With its charisma, great view of the Bellagio fountains, and great French cuisine, Le Cirque will forever be one of the great Vegas restaurants of all time.",

    "text": "This is probably one of my fave go to classic dining in Vegas. Hubby and I always seem to make it back here for our anniversary celebrations. I typically always get their 3 course and hubby orders their 5 course meals. And the pricing on these pre fixe options are nicely priced.   Their food is very consistent. My faves at this restaurant besides the flavors is their staff. From the hostess to the bartender to the manager, sommelier and the servers... service is top notch.   My fave flavors here are also their classics: hamachi, foie gras, wagyu beef, sea bass and of course their classic souffle. Order the souffle ahead it does take time.   For some reason I always end up being seated in the best seats next to window with the incredible bellagio water show (which reminds me of oceans  eleven - classic film just like this restaurant).   Make sure you taste this Michelin  and Ivo, GM and sommeliers: Sanae and Freddy will take care of you.   One last note - this is classy restaurant dressy and elegant attire is given. Guys please don't wear shorts or open shoes (flip flops and sandals) you will be asked to magically appear in long pants and some closed toe shoes. You have now been informed.",

    "text": "Wow. It was a circus indeed. The food I mean. It really takes you through a delicious journey.  I will start off by saying the dishes are so damn cute. Where can I purchase????  We had read about  Le cirque online and decided to do the 3 course tasking menu; which was also suggested by our server since we had a show to get to.  I was very surprised by that you get many bonus items in addition.  I LOVED the chocolate bread and brioche they give you to start while you wait for your first course. Super fun and just delicious. Seems like no restaurants in Vegas give you bread to start.  All of the dishes were amazing, I ordered the sea bass, but I got to say I wish I had ordered the rabbit like my husband did. While my sea bass was amazing, the rabbit really was a whole other experience and it's the star of the menu, very rich and tender.  A few things happened that was a nice surprise but would of been good to know. I got the Chocolate Ball for desert which is outstanding it's very fresh tasting chocolate and it's plenty to share. However you get 2 bonus deserts! A box of chocolates to go and macaroons. You practically don't need to order desert. I didn't get to try these bonuses since I was so full by the time I finished my whole Chocolate Ball.  also....while Le Cirque deserves 5 stars all the way, for the food, and the service. My husband and I made sure we followed the dress code. It does take away from the dining experience for others when a dress code is not enforced. Might want to think about this, because it kind of feels insulting when we made sure we were up par and others came in in athletic attire and denim.  We are members at a club in our home town and they won't let you walk inside if the dress requirements are not met.   Anyways if your in Vegas GO HERE and get the rabbit.",

It turned out that Le Cirque is definitely and pleasingly an exception.    I decided to celebrate my birthday at Le Cirque for a second time. Similar to my first visit, Le Cirque has maintained their creativity in their menu with remarkable food quality and presentation with exceptional service. Their signature Lobster and Avocado Salad was so refreshing and delightful that I could have been satisfied with an entree portion of this dish for my meal. My entree, though, was a Potato crusted Mediterranean Sea Bass that was prepared equally well and absolutely delicious. And the grand marnier souffle was heavenly for dessert to finish a flawless dinner service.  But wait!! They still served a complimentary selection of macarons after dessert that looked and tasted like they were just flown in from France.   I was happy that Le Cirque was able to make my birthday extra special again and it remains as one of my top 5 best restaurants in the world!!   I will definitely come back again (and again) and would recommend it to anyone looking for a special occasion place to go on the Strip. Kudos to the chef and management team!",

    "text": "Over the last couple of years, we've seen a lot of changes on the Strip, but one thing that remains consistent is the Strip's fine dining experience. This is why I decided to come here to celebrate my birthday with my SO last year (yes, I know this is a very late review).   Ambiance As soon as you walk in, you'll understand why the restaurant is called' Le Cirque'. It made me feel like I'm dining inside a huge beach ball because of the colorful drapes on the ceiling. The space is also much smaller than it seems in pictures, so be forewarned. As many reviews in here states, you might feel slightly crammed, but since the crowd here are not the rowdy/crazy, it didn't bother me that much.  Service Excellent service. As soon as we sat down, I was greeted with a 'semi-personalized' note wishing me happy birthday. I had brought in my own bottle of wine and they were happy to let it breathe before we begin our fabulous foodie adventure!   Food The biggest motivator on why I decided to come here to celebrate my oh-so-important birthday was because of the glorious photo of blue crab with caviar. The moment I saw that photo, I knew I had to come here. So naturally, we proceeded with the $135/pp degustation menu. I was happy to pay the supplement charge for the blue crab + for the foie gras. Both are excellent, but I really thought the blue crab caviar was the most memorable dish for its presentation and for its flavor. Risotto w/ black truffle was also very good.",

The lamb was really good but I messed up and would have liked it a bit more cooked. For desert we got the souffle and chocolate ball. This is truly an experience, in a intimate setting. It's a small place and it fills up fast. It was worth every penny. Although the portions look small, you won't leave hungry. They provide bread and a bunch of extras throughout.",

First course: SAUTEED FOIE GRAS: wild strawberry fragoli compote, meyer lemon, feuilletine paired with a late harvest Sauternes 2015 vintage. The sweet and syrupy nature of the Sauternes compliments the rich and flavorful foie gras. Second course, I chose the COLORADO LAMB CHOP: spring broccoli, white asparagus, aleppo pepper cream sauce: medium rare. This course the sommelier chose a super Tuscany: Le Sughere do Frassinello. The wine is medium bodied dark red with lasting earthy notes of berries. Lamb chops were cooked to perfection, not games at all and paired well with wine that's easily acquired. Last course, I had CREME BRULEE \"LE CIRQUE\": classic tahitian vanilla bean creme brulee; paired with Kracher: 2017 Auslese Cuvee White. Light yellow sweet dessert wine has a crisp and light finish which brings out the vanilla bean flavor.   My friends had different pre-fixe menu courses. We were all very happy with staff and experience.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 8. We all did the Prix-Fixe Menu that was $108 per person. This menu consisted of an appetizer, entree and dessert. They have other menus that are 5-course or even 10-course, but we decided to just go with the 3-course one.   I chose the Lobster and Avocado salad, Seabass and they did a special non-dairy fruit cocktail for me since I don't eat dairy.  Our dinner started out with bread!! They have this white chocolate bread that was sooo good. It wasn't super sweet, just a bit. It was soft and warm. Try this bread!!!  The Lobster and Avocado Salad was really good! It was quite filling too. I liked how this dish was really light and refreshing. I tried my boyfriend's Hamachi appetizer and it was good too, but nothing extraordinary.   My main course was the Seabass. It was cooked really well. However, it didn't blow me away. I've had seabass at other places that were similar if not better. The dish was also really filling and heavy too.   For dessert, I was served a fruit cocktail that consisted of a fruit sorbet and berry compote. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and wasn't heavy or rich at all. Great way to end the meal.   Overall, Le Cirque is a French fine dining restaurant that serves good food. But be ready to spend a lot because it's definitely not cheap!",

    "text": "Le Cirque is a beautiful French restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel with limited views of the Fountain.  With heavy drapery and a narrow portion of the view, the focus inside is instead on the luxurious take on a French circus theme.  There are colorful swooping fabrics draping the ceiling and beautiful murals throughout the restaurant.  The tableware is also whimsical with monkeys on every plate.  The service is exquisite - absolutely first class.  Both our server and the sommelier have been at the restaurant since its inception twenty years ago.  The sommelier is tremendously knowledgeable and had remarkable selections.  Our waiter was jovial and friendly - he made us feel so comfortable.  We came before a show, so we went with the shorter (and more modestly priced) Pre-Theater Menu.  For $72 per person, there were three quarters.  An additional $40 per person entitled us to a wine pairing with each dish.  The starters and the dessert really stole the show - they were both perfectly prepared and absolutely heavenly.  Alas, had I to do it again, I would have skipped the entree.  There was nothing wrong with it but it was so dull.  We had:  Escargots Au Beurre D'Ail: I think that this may have been the best dish of the night.  Eight perfectly tender and cleaned snails were served in a rich and nutty black garlic herb butter and topped with a little anise.  This was served with a fresh and mineraly French Chablis.  The sauce was not to be left behind, and I highly recommend the bacon cheddar ciabatta for finishing it up. It was just the right amount of wrong (whereas the brioche was a little dull and dry and the white chocolate coffee loaf was a little odd with other flavors as it was so sweet).  Foie Gras Poele: thank goodness Nevadians aren't as moronic as Californians (where I am from) and outlawing the most amazing stuff on the planet.  A perfectly cooked piece of foie gras was served whole and topped with a cinnamon and ginger bread crumb.  Alongside were little dollops of truffle jam and green apple puree and a drizzle of calvados reduction as well as some little herbs.  The dish was amazing.  It was served with what is generally a dessert wine - a Royal Tokaji - but the pairing was brilliant with this dish.  For our entrees, we each had the Poulet Roti.  I, for one, just love chicken.  However, this was the most boring and underseasoned preparation that I have ever been served in a fine dining restaurant.  The white meat portion was heading to overcooked territory as well (it wasn't but it was on its way).  It's such a shame, because the accompaniments were perfect.  The asparagus was sweet and crisp tender.  The mushrooms were meaty.  The foie gras sauce was rich (albeit insufficient to liven up the chicken).  I really couldn't believe that they could pull so little flavor out of the chicken.  The wine pairing, on the other hand, made me nervous and ended up being perfect.  A red blend with 50% Sangiovese and equal parts of Merlot and Cabernet was not too bold as to overwhelm the dish but stood up to the aggressive flavors in the accompaniments.  Fortunately, after a most disappointing main dish, the dessert really shined.  The dark chocolate sphere surrounding white chocolate ice cream topped with praline mousse and hazlenuts that was broken by a milk chocolate sauce was heavenly.  It was creamy, nutty and chocolately and all was very fresh and used exquisite quality ingredients.  You could tasted it in the cacao.  The pairing of a jammy and sweet port with bold dark plum flavors was perfect.  A cappuccino at the end (VERY STRONG!) and a box of treats for the road (two macaroons, two candies and two boxes of truffles) was the perfect farewell to a lovely dinner.  I enjoyed my time at Le Cirque.  Next time, I would probably skip the entrees and stick with starters and dessert in the bar.",

The restaurant itself is surprisingly small but quaint.    First warning, tho they offer multiple options as far as 3,5,10,white truffle course menus everyone at the table must order off the same. So one person cant get the 5 course menu and another get a 3 course. So be prepared to collaborate as a group.   Service was like expected at any fine dining establishment, they worked in teams so we never felt neglected.    On to the food...presentation was beautiful on all courses. I enjoyed the foie gras as my 1st course, the sea bass as my 2nd and the beautiful strawberry parfait as my dessert. Another guest with us enjoyed the crab with caviar and souffle.  Everything was delicious only thing i can remember not enjoying was the added sauce placed below the sea bass, too sweet.",

    "text": "If it were based on the service alone this place would get a billion stars. If it was based on the experience alone it would be a 5-star. If I would have paid for it... I probably would not be giving such a high rating to this place.   We did the five course and I was able to try a little bit of my group's food as well.   Sauteed foie gras was an experience that I don't think I ever need to try again. You can taste the pine nuts and the dates that duck was fed. Super tender but there was something about the texture that was not my fave.   Soup with the egg in it was so delightful. I hate egg and that set me off a little bit but as far as flavor this might have been my favorite thing. So savory and creamy.   Veal cheek was good not great, especially considering price. It was tender which was nice, but the flavor was a little off for me.  Chicken was good, but not memorable.   Wagyu beef was definitely not the best I have ever had but it was tender and delicious.  THE VERDICT: For the 14 people that were there, we escaped with a $5,000 check which from what I have heard isn't bad? Be sure you know what supplement means when you order it (and basically everything is supplement) it means they will charge you more than the $125/head. The pineapple drink that they took off the menu is by far the best drink they have and is worth going and trying again. Go for the experience, not the food, and you will not be disappointed.",

I expected a much bigger and intimidating restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by how small and cosy the restaurant is. It felt very comfortable being in there.  The service was top notch...we had a designated waiter but the rest of the staff kept an eye on us and to make sure that all our requests were met and not delayed when our waiter was attending to somebody else. Great teamwork!  The food was amazing as well. I had escargot as my appetizer and my husband had langoustine with the top of caviar. I would go back there just for these two dishes.   I had the turbot and my husband had the lobster. The turbot was good...not exceptional, the lobster was very good.   We had the Grand Marnier  souffle for desert and coffee. The souffle was too sweet for our taste but held its shape and was very nice overall.  I would go back most definitely for their tasting menu given they add escargot and langoustine to it.  If you want a nice romantic evening with your significant other or dinner with friends who appreciate finer things in life then this is your place.",

    "text": "I would give a 3.4-3.5 if I could! Le Cirque is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant--the decorations are basically elegant circus eye candy--with a very nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  The servers are wonderful. They're courteous and want you to have the best dining experience possible. Plus, if you're off to see a show like we were right after dinner, they time the dinner carefully and even give you directions on where to pick up your tickets/see the show.  The food, however, fell a bit short for even the discounted theater prix fixe we were paying. For the price we expected straight A atmosphere, service, and an almost perfect meal. We did love the variety of bread though! The appetizers impressed: my boyfriend loved his escargot, and my risotto was great, although not mind-blowing. The entrees, what was meant to be the star of the meal, was the part that disappointed. My seared salmon was only luke warm, although cooked perfectly, and lacked an interesting flavor profile to lift it from decent to excellent. It may even have been under-seasoned. More of the singular tomato on the dish would have brightened it. My boyfriend can't recall his entree, except that it was \"alright,\" meaning it was not memorable. His father mistakenly ordered a chicken dish thinking it had foie gras in it (it only had foie jus), and was so distraught about it they actually brought out a little plate of foie gras for him. (The service was really above and beyond!) He was very happy about this, but without the little side of foie gras, we all agreed it would have been a very bland chicken dish (even a little dry at times).  As for dessert, we had banana souffle. It was unfortunately slightly undercooked, although the flavor was pleasant and light. They also brought out a nice tray of mignardises at the end, which were fun to try. Still, I wish it had been an overall better food experience!",

I wish I wasn't, so I could have enjoyed the food better.  We ordered the degustation menu which turned out to be a little too much for me since there's four courses. Started with an amuse bouche of foie gras mousse which was excellent, followed by our appetizers, a sauteed foie gras and nantucket bay scallops. Both are delicious but I made a mental note to order foie gras next time I'm here because that's the better one.  For fish we both ordered the paupiette of seabass, crispy potatoes, braised leeks in pinot noir reduction. Good but didn't blow me away.  Here's the winner - the kobe beef. I'm not a beef person and so I didn't order this because I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it at $65 extra. REGRET. Husband ordered this and kobe beef is really something else. The texture and flavor is simply out of this world. I despise my veal after tasting it. You know, when you feel like you married the wrong guy? Could have been savoring that kobe beef instead of the drab boring veal. Maybe if I've never met kobe beef, the veal would have been alright.  Dessert - order the chocolate ball and see the chain effect. The table next to us ordered one and we decided we had to get one. When ours came the new table next to us saw that and decided they had to order one too. It is literally white chocolate icecream encased in a frozen chocolate shell. The server then pours hot melted chocolate over the ball and you watch as the outer shell melt away to reveal the icecream inside. It's such a visual treat. Service, I quote Minners N. - \"impeccable\" and \"genuine\". Not only are the service professionals extremely attentive, they are not pretentious like some other places I've been to.  They don't serve you, they take care of you.  Will I shell out that kind of money to eat here again? Hellya!",

It was hard narrowing it down with so many great choices but after reading several yelp reviews and recommendations from foodies, we made reservations at Le Cirque.   The service here is impeccable.  Everyone made us feel so welcome in such a genuine way.  Our glasses were never empty and the waiters were good about picking up our empty plates when we both were done- as to not rush us as is the case when one person finishes and the waiters take their plate right away.  The sommelier was so nice to us when we wanted a bottle of wine to pair well with both of our dishes.  He did not snub us when we told him our price range or that we weren't too big of a wine drinkers.  He gave us great recommendations and we ended up with a nice Sauvignon Blanc that is now my husband's favorite wine. The waiters seemed very genuine too- made lots of small talk asking where we were from and talking about good eats in Chicago.  We did the tasting menu and every dish was awesome.  Usually when you do a tasting, there's a few dishes that you could do without, but every dish was \"lick your plate clean\" worthy.  Husband and I usually trade plates half-way through the dish, and we both struggled to give up our plates but were glad when we did because the other plate was just as good.  I don't think I could even pick a favorite dish because every dish was great.  One that I was borderline about was the sea urchin ice cream.  The first 2 tastes were really good, but after awhile it was too rich.  Since i traded halfway, it was a good dish that wasn't overpowering.  My husband LOVED the foie gras and duck dishes.    We would definitely visit Le Cirque again any time we're in vegas- might even check out the one in NYC next time we're there.  Best. Dining. Experience. Ever.",

I mean nothing really comes to WOW me, the risotto was good but not the best that i had, the scallops were alright but i live in the Bay Area, nothing special. Foie Grae? I've had it all. So nothing that really wowed me. And Kobe beef? No sir this was not kobe beef and if it was it was trash... I've had kobe beef in Kobe, Tokyo, and elsewhere and this was no better or even close or up to par with Kobe beef. that was an extra $35 i think...   Dessert? Ahhhh this is where they were saved, the creativity of the pastry/dessert Chef is only rivaled by on that i've been to based on creativity and taste that is Atelier Crenn in SF. Wowed and it tasted really good.   Price? Expensive. But thats already known, i just wish that i got more for what we paid.   Overall? Let's say i'd rather have eaten at Picasso for a 3rd time then to eat here for a first (for the $$ spent). But now that i've said i tried it, unless i hear they changed something about it, i don't need to come back. Unless i'm invited to come back and try. So i offer Le Cirque a challenge, come back and show me why your 1 michelin, And change my mind for me.  Tip for \"O\" watchers: The gf almost missed her show because they were running a bit slow. If they say 8PM is alright for the tasting menu to go to the 10PM show? Try making reservations for 7:20.   Stars? 2.5/5 i'll round up.",

I read another review that said the portions are small, I would have to disagree and say they are perfect! We asked for wine pairing with our meal and the choices given to us were also brilliant. To top it all off they gave us a complimentary dessert wine and a small box of chocolates. We were treated like VIP's from start to finish. Definitely the place to go if you want a special evening. Ps the venison is amazing!",

    "text": "For the ambiance, quality of food, and general service....we knew this was going to be an expensive evening.  The 3 bottles of wine didn't help either, not to mention I know that the New York Le Cirque is expensive (which is why I've never been to that one).  I'm not sure if this is their standard dinner, but dinner was a three course pre-fixe meal for $98.  Not bad considering this was Le Cirque, but definitely up there (I mentioned the 3 bottles of wine right?)  Everything on the menu looked fairly good, so it was actually reasonably difficult to pick an entree.  With a table of 8, we all happened to select a good mix of appetizers.  Mine being the escargot, it was very tasty, yet rich.  The dish had ample snails to go around, that I just had to share.  They were that rich I couldn't finish.  The other appetizers on the table looked as pretty as they were delicious according to my dinner party.  The actual entree menu was split into a traditional side and a contemporary side.  Interesting for a table of 8, we had a total of 2 actual entrees.  2 ordered the poached lobster with king crab ravioli, and 6 ordered the chilean sea bass - I ordered the latter, though I wished for the former when they came to the table.  Though cooked nicely, I thought the mushrooms that came underneath the fish were tastier than the actual fish.  Did I mention that before the appetizer and before the entree they gave us a little more food?  Probably adding to the bill, but the 2 additional \"meals\" were yummy - some kind of mushroom soup thing, and the risotto.  The risotto again being very rich, I couldn't even finish it.  What I found interesting was in between the appetizer and the entree wasn't just the risotto, but was a long long long wait.  Too long considering this fancy schmancy restaurant.  I think even they realized they were moving a bit too slow for food service, because as they offered us our entrees, they suggested for the table to just take a sample serving of desserts....to \"save time\".  Although they tried to make it seem like it was saving time for us, me thinks it was saving them some time.  I don't think the table could have complained anyway, as the sample serving of desserts basically involved them bringing us 8 completely different desserts...so we just took a bit and passed them along.  Eventually, we each found a dessert we liked.  Thank goodness no one was allergic to anything.  Overall, I honestly was torn between a 3.5 to 4 star rating.  Honestly it was because of the wait between dishes.  What was their saving grace though was their quality and presentation of their food.  To dine at Le Cirque is truly all about the experience.  Just be prepared to pay for it.",

    "text": "To dine at Le Cirque is to experience authentic French fine dining.  Located in the back of the Bellagio Casino, the atmosphere is amazingly quiet and a bit aristocratic.  The service could not be improved upon; it was truly wonderful.  As one example, a partial table-over-cloth was brought out lest there be a stain in view.  My guest was offered a black cloth napkin to better match her dress; she also received a complimentary jewelry box as a gift.  The menu was fixed - you were required to order a 3 course meal which started at $98.  The food was very good; I had the lobster salad (good, not great), and the duck (again good, not great).  My guest had the beef (which cost an extra $45) which was very good.    The desserts were quite awesome, souffle was delicious, although after two courses, it was hard to find room to enjoy it.  Overall, this place should be reserved for the wealthy or those celebrating a special occasion (or if you really want to impress someone).  It was very expensive, but it was a thoroughly memorable dining experience.",

Filet of Dover Sole Meuniere was phenomenal and a surprisingly large portion. The lobster salad appetizer was full of lobster, they didn't skimp. The assorted breads were amazing and it was a struggle not to fill up on them. The tray of mini desserts was devoured. Service was outstanding. It was surely a once in a lifetime experience. P.S. Unless you are seated directly at a window table you will only see the tip of the fountain show. Walk out after dinner and watch it from the Strip.",

My two favorite ingredients in french cuisine is Foie Gras and Black truffle anything! So I got the Foie Gras appetizer and the black truffle risotto and it was probably one of the most delicious meals of my life. We topped off the meal with an amazing bottle of red and a few desserts because I am very, incredibly, indecisive when I'm not dead set on something. I think we had the poached strawberry, the crepe, and creme brulee. They were all delicious!   Le Cirque is mostly an older more conservative crowd so dress accordingly. My date wore a button down / jacket and I wore a LBD (little black dress). Just don't wear your clubbing skank gear here or you'll definitely look like an escort. hahaha",

    "text": "\"It's not about the food, it's about the experience\". That's probably the best way I can describe my recent visit to Le Cirque but I would say the food was pretty darn good too. We chose this place for our last night in Las Vegas, a pre-cursor to the famous O show at the Bellagio hotel. After catching the spectacular and dazzling water fountain show, we made our way inside. The decor is eclectic, imagine a heavily French circus with cute little monkeys printed on the plates. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly, offering recommendations and even accommodating our dietary needs (no pork or alcohol). Husband ordered off the Degustation Menu (5 course), I order A La Carte (3 course). Honestly between his choices and mine plus the free chestnut soup, amuse bouche and pre desserts, I counted about 10 different courses (example of good service: for every dish where he got one and I didn't they placed an extra plate besides me so we could share!). And the desserts, don't even get me started on the desserts. Pure chocolate heaven. And pre dessert I mentioned? Lemon sorbet with Pop Rocks. Pop Rocks! At a 5 diamond star restaurant. Simply brilliant. They were also really good with timing and mindful of our theatre tickets so everything came out at a good pace. Overall a wonderful experience, yes it's pricey but once in awhile you gotta splurge on yourself. And the view from our table of the water show only added to the ambiance.",

Cheesy with good chunks of lobster. perfect dish, beet flavor a tad mild.  Course 2-  seabass- interesting presentation (quasi fried?)- great dish, but the baked/fried coating was unnecessary. paired with uninspiring side. Paired with nice pinot. Wife- Tenderloin- absolutely cooked to perfection. Essentially melted in your mouth like butter. Paired with a decent but uninspiring cab.  Course 3-  Raspberry sorbet- delicate but beautiful dish. Paired with port that was just not to my liking. Chocolate ball- excellent presentation but uninspiring delivery. paired with Riesling that my wife enjoyed.  Overall- Service was excellent and attentive, bread was great, but overall while everything was good, aside from the tenderloin, nothing left us glad we dropped $300 for 2.",

I was worried we would feel out of place, as we don't usually frequent upscale restaurants, but I could not have felt more comfortable and at ease. The waiter and table staff somehow found the perfect balance between always being there when we needed them but not making us feel like someone is constantly looking over our shoulder.  Lastly, I walked in knowing I would have buyer's remorse the next day (I had never payed $360 for dinner for 2 before - tip included). But everything was so good it felt totally worth it. I am going back in August, though for a smaller menu ;)  Definitely a must try!",

When we sat down and I saw that the menu had no prices I got a little bit nervous. Glad I wasn't paying...  The food was amazing and the service was great as well. The restaurant was pretty quiet which was nice for our group and allowed us to chat with our customers over dinner. If money is no object, you should check this place out next time you're at the Bellagio!",

The food 5 star quality, I would highly suggest their truffle pasta, it was literally a masterpiece in it's simplicity. Plain pasta with the slightest hint of oil, covered in thick generous shavings of truffles. $70? Bargain for this kind of culinary delight! The best thing about this restaurant though? You can literally watch the Bellagio's famous fountain show from your seat while enjoying your meal.  The hungry kitten's tip? Make sure you get a reservation, even on a Thursday night we had trouble. They said they had no tables available, so my partner checked on open table and was able to get a reservation, we walked back in and they actually seated us. Never hurts to try!",

Totally spot-on, without being stuffy formal.  They didn't miss a beat from filling glasses, setting proper cutlery, serving, follow-up...all of it was perfect.  Presentation - while not over the top architectural, it is French Classical cuisine, so presentation is tight and clean.  The dinnerware was lovely and different.  lol  Food - outstanding.  There was a pinot noir butter sauce on the sea bass that I could have drank from a demitasse cup.  Apparently I moaned through every course, as the food was just THAT GOOD.   And, to top it off, they give you a lovely little red jewelry box filled with chocolate truffles to take home.  My only \"complaint\" is that I wish they instituted some kind of dress code.  I know it's Vegas, but the couple next to us was in tee-shirts and sneakers/jeans.  To me, fine dining should require a bit of class from the patrons.  Otherwise, phenomenal, and if you're in Vegas, GO.",

The most memorable for me was always the foie gras, lobster salad, white truffle risotto (depending on season because they sometimes don't have white truffles), and the bass wrapped in crispy potato.  Dinner here isn't cheap, but isn't terribly expensive either for the delicious food and impeccable service.",

The technique alone for the Filet de Loup de Mer Paupiette of Sea-Bass, Crispy Potatoes, Braised Leeks, Pinot Noir Reduction should demostarte caliber of this place. To add truffle risotto, four different deserts... I am in heaven.  Note the menu may be a little confusing so ask for assistance if needed, I did.",

Fred took us on a wine journey - and I'm not embellishing.  The knowledge, the feel, the history, the wisdom that accompanied the wine pairings elevated the food and the experience.  It would not have been the same without him.  Hats off to all the staff who delivered outstanding service worthy of the establishment.  A little bit of the Vegas of our hopes and dreams in 2015.

    "text": "When friends of ours were married at Bellagio we wanted a special celebratory dinner afterward.  From our call to request a reservation through paying the check, the staff at Le Cirque was professional and attentive.  It clearly mattered a great deal to everyone at the restaurant that we have a perfect experience.    We started with drinks in the small lounge because we arrived early.  One of our number described what she liked In a wine, rather than peruse the Wine tome.  Within moments she had a glass of something that was perfect.  In fact we ordered a bottle for the table with dinner.  While we were sitting there a couple arrived not exactly dressed for dinner at Le Cirque (but by no means poorly).  They asked if they could sit in the lounge and have desert.  They were made to feel welcome in the lounge, which struck me as gracious and unpretentious.  We did not feel like we were waiting long for a table, but the staff was clearly concerned about the wait.  As it turned out, they wanted us to be seated at what they considered the best table in the house for this special dinner, and passed on seating us elsewhere.   Mind you, we were not even guests at Belagio.  No VIPs in this group.  The food was amazing, the table was ideal, and every course was just perfect. We all ordered the Prixe Fixe menu.  First though, we were served a complimentary appetizer of smoked salmon with something else I can't recall with a caviar garnish.  Each serving was in a small dish and the server who brought it out asked if we would please consider being certain that all the layers of the dish were present in each bite.  It was very good. Then the actual appetizers came out.  I had the tenderloin carpaccio.  It came accompanied by a tiny raw quail egg, and our waiter explained the custom of pouring the tiny egg on top of the beef and eating it with toast. Another in our group had the cold corn soup, which she reported was indescribably good, and like nothing she had ever had before.  The others selected the lobster salad which garnered many complements.   My entree was the rabbit symphony, and I'm glad I selected it.  Others had the diver scallops and one chose the sea bass which, for lack of a better description, resembled a large egg roll because it was inside a potato crust.  Everyone was pleased with their selection.  The only mistake made by the staff all night was a very happy accident for us.  We ended up with a chocolate souffle for the table in addition to the other desserts. Each one was unique and delicious.  The chocolate ball should not be missed.  It is a perfect sphere of chocolate served in a shallow bowl. The server then pours warm chocolate sauce on top at the table and slowly the ball dissolves to reveal a praline filling.  The decor is unique and beautiful in the cozy dining room overlooking the fountains.  The concept is that you are inside a closed jewelry box.  We were surprised how small the dining room was, but the acoustics are such that conversation is easy.  I don't think there was any music, which I only noticed toward the end, which was well after the advertised closing time.  At no point did we feel like we were overstaying our welcome.  The restaurant was generous to say the least, and when we couldn't possibly eat another bite, a beautiful dish of petit fours appeared.  Naturally, they disappeared.  It is impossible to pass on anything created in this kitchen.  The ladies were then presented with a gift of a miniature jewelry box with two chocolates inside.  We all agreed this was the best dining experience any of us had every had, and we are all...let's say \"experienced\"...diners.  This truly is as good as it gets.  Do not pass on an opportunity to to visit.",

They have a tendency to take you somewhere far away from Vegas through the ambience, the food, the atmosphere.  Le Cirque is a small restaurant that is decorated like the finest circus big top I have ever seen.  They have a monster wine list with a french speaking, well experienced sommolier to match.  It is almost irrelevant in regards to what I had because when you are paying as much as my group paid for the bottles of wine and the food, the staff will do whatever is necessary so you leave satisfied.  My party of three left satisifed having tried a variety of meats with perfectly pair wines to match.  I would say that it is necessary to make reservations.  If you are on a date, don't look at the eye candy that are on the arms of other men.  If you are going to do that bring your own.  The staff is attentive but they also don't want you to waste their time because they are busy.  They are friendly but not indulgent.    The bartender is good for conversation though so if you get there early hang at the bar.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Le Cirque last night, and let's start off by saying that the food was terrific. The service, well, that's a completely different story.  To recount everything that went wrong would go on too long for anyone to bother to read.  It started out with the two of us being seated squeezed between two tables such that I was bumped into a half dozen times by servers for the next table.  We assumed that there was good reason for this initially, but after a while it was clear there was no good reason why they couldn't have seated us somewhere else.  Then, no one came to even ask if we wanted something to drink before asking for our orders.  We were looking forward to a nice meal, and we both decided to have the degustation menu with wine pairings.  Without running through all six courses, there was at least one significant problem with each course: I was brought the wrong dish for one, my wife was brought the wrong wine for another, etc.  And they could never seem to get the timing of the wine down, with respect to the food.  We went from getting the wine for one course 20 minutes before the food arrived to getting the food before the wine got there at all for the next.  Even when they began to sense that we were getting irritated, it seemed that they were too hopelessly disorganized to be able to get to correct the situation.  It would be nice to able to experience the food at Le Cirque under better circumstances, but I can't imagine going back there any time soon, and I certainly could not recommend it to anyone else.  Addendum:  To their credit, the GM of Le Cirque contacted me to apologize for the bad experience and asked for the opportunity to make it up to us.  No telling when we will be back in Vegas, though.",

I had to ask twice for water refill and once for bread refill.  When the waiters come by the table and see an empyt glass of water (we had multiple bottles of wine on the table so maybe they thought that is all I drink?) FILL IT.  Now I feel like lowering to a single star as they should know better.",

The Muscovy duck for two, the foie gras and the lobster and avocado salad were so delicious.  Everything we ate was wonderful and the staff could not have been nicer, making us feel special.    Bellagio is a beautiful hotel and Le Cirque is elegant, yet inviting, with lovely views of the Bellagio fountains.  I love everything about this restaurant and look forward to dining here on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

Me and my date started off with a few martinis. I didn't see beer on the menu. So why not. They waiter brought us over a selection of various fresh bread. Not so fresh but still good.  We first started with a mint pea soup. Cold, and different. But it was very good. Then moved on to the lobster salad. Served cold of course. Not very much flavor. But it did the job. From there my date ordered the foie gras. I had the sea bass. Both dishes were very excellent. Mind you, that was the very first time I tried foie gras. Different yet satisfying.   To finish up the meal. They brought me a vanilla suflet . With a scoop of vanilla ice creme, and vanilla topping. With happy birthday written all over it. I gotta say it was the little things that impressed me with this restaurant. Me and date were sat by the glass windows. Able to view the fountain show. Every time I got up to use the restroom. A fresh napkin was laid out for me. The flaws were far and few. The size of the restaurant is rather small. Not to mention that the waiters are rather slow. But other than that. Everything went smoothly.",

    "text": "The scallop risotto was literally to die for.  TO DIE FOR!  If we weren't in such a nice restaurant, I would have used my finger to scrape every bit of rice and sauce into my eagerly awaiting mouth!  MMMMMMMM!!!  It's four months later, and I can STILL taste it!  We had the tasting menu, so each course wasn't the biggest, but in the end, we were both severely full.  Although I loved our meal, I think next time I'll opt for the full sized risotto, because it was just that amazing!    The chocolate souffle was likewise out of this world!  I've never had one quite so soft, airy, and fluffy.  It was like eating a cloud and put all other souffles I've had to shame.  Actually, in retrospect, I can't say I've ever had a proper souffle, now that I know what they're supposed to be like.  The rest of the meal was very good, but not outstanding.  My duck was a little dry.  The sea bass was nicely done.  I don't remember much else.  On that note, I'd probably rate the food a 4 or a 4.5.  The risotto and souffle were 10's, so that evens out to 5 overall.    Regardless, service was impeccable.  We were waited on hand and foot and made to feel as though we were the only two in the restaurant.  Every dish was explained, from ingredients to eating etiquette, and there was just the perfect amount of personal conversation to make it seem as though we were all friends and that the staff really cared about who we were.  Immaculate!  I've never had such service!  They even matched our dinner napkins to our clothing colors!  So crazy!  It was a lovely (albeit pricey) birthday dinner from the boyfriend!  Le Cirque is a lovely restaurant for a special occasion, and it's perfectly situated for an after-dinner show with Cirque.  :)",

Some of the bread they have here is also available at the belagio buffet which I had the next morning! Every dish is prepared with beautiful presentation and looks like it should be framed.  For starters I had the foie gras which was the best foie gras I have had. It was horribly unfortunate my date didn't want any and had to eat it all myself.  For the entree I had what they called a Rabbit Melody, and a melody it was. It was multiple rabbit preparations on top of each other, including rabbit ravioli, surrounded by spatzle and some amazing sauces.  They have a fabulous wine and desert menu in which I encourage you to try their armagnacs. There simply the best here I have ever had.  The entire meal and experience was fantastic and one I would love to enjoy again.",

After a long day of shopping and shmoozing, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a fancy shmancy dinner.  2 things that stand out here is, the service and atmosphere.  The bar and dining room is decorated like it was a beautiful circus tent.  But, the food did not match.  The Amuse Bouche was a sweet strawberry cream with goat cheese which I thought was too sweet to prepare for us for the next course.  It did not cleanse the palate but instead made us feel we were eating dessert.  This was served after the apps but before the main course.  For apps I had the Escargot which was prepared out of the shell.  The garlic butter sauce was bland and the snails were chewy and overdone.  The croutons were served mixed into the dish which in turn made them mushy.  Had to be the worst preparation of Escargot I've ever eaten.  For my main dish I had the Atlantic Cod.  The fish was fine.... BORING.........  Yes, of course the size of the main course would have left a baby starving but that's not my beef.  It's that it lacked any creativity or flavor.  Same went for dessert.  I had the Chocolate Souffle.  This souffle compared to Bottega Louie's is like comparing Boones Farm to Chateau LaTour.  The service was excellent, yes... but the lack of flavor and creativity made this dinner forgettable.    LA fine dining blows Vegas out of the water.",

    "text": "When I was young, my parents would take me to McDonald's and cheap buffets whenever we went to Vegas. That is why, now that I am  older, I asked my boyfriend to splurge on some fine dining. Well, not only fine dining but AAA 5 diamond dining.   I like ordering prix fixe menus (I splurged on the $145 menu) because it gives me a chance to sample the general style of the restaurant and chef without giving me too much of a headache. I was not disappointed in the least because the food was so tasty, fresh, tender, perfectly cooked to my liking, etc.  The food was excellent. There was nothing that I didn't like. Here is a list of some things that were on the 9-course prix fixe menu for the day I went (it changes daily): -Lobster salad  -Sauteed Fois Gras with Macerated Fruit and Hazelnuts (YUM !!!!) -Colorado rack of Lamb with Tender Vegetables and Lobster Jus  I was feeling adventurous and decided to hone my wine-aficionado tastes by adding wine parings to my meal (an additional $65). The best idea I've had this week. Chateau Gravas Saternes, I have found you as my new love :D  The service was prompt and helpful, yet not as attentive as other places I have been to. There is a spectacular view of the Bellagio water fountain show out of the windows.  The reason why I didn't rate this place a five, however, is that the tables are way too close to others, making it difficult to walk and just noisy in general. There were actually many large groups at this restaurant, and though I was happy that everyone was having a good time, it took away from the classiness of this place. Also, they charge you for water, which just makes you feel like they try to siphon money away with you every chance they get.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to splurge and go for the 'fancy' French restaurant experience.  After some deliberation we decided on Le Cirque and I'm so happy we did.  Everything about this place from the decor, the service staff and the food is exceptional.    We had 7:30 pm reservations on a Tuesday night.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated immediately.  The interior space is smaller than I would've expected.  The setting is intimate but not clausterphobic   The ceiling is covered in fabric making it look like the inside of a circus tent and the walls are covered with old-time circus paintings with matching artwork on the plates and dishes.  The room is relatively well-lit (for a restaurant) and the noise level was low-medium.  A number of the seats have a view of the fountains.  We didn't specify a seating location and were seated on the opposite side of the room.  That was fine with us, but I imagine you can specify a fountain-view table.    The service staff here is simply amazing.  They truly make the meal memorable.  I've eaten in all different kinds of restaurants from the fancy to straight-up shacks.  No matter how many fancy ones I hit, I always wonder if I'm going to feel uncomfortable.  The staff here immediately took away any concerns I had.  They do a wonderful job of being extremely attentive, informative and personal without ever being stuffy or pretentious.  We each had the Degustation Menu with the premium wine pairing.  This tasting menu is unique because it gives you choices for each course.  They started with an Amusee Bouche, a little goat cheese and strawberry parfait thingy.  Very tasty.  Then it was on to courses.  The wife had the langustino, scallop, halibut and the Kobe beef.  I had the king crab, lobster risotto, sea bass and rabbit.  Everything was amazing.  I could go on an on in excruciating detail each course but I'll keep it short and say that it was up to par and I couldn't find a fault with any of it.  That said, I think the winners of the night were the king crab, lobster risotto, halibut and Kobe beef.  The beef is incredible.  It was my first time trying it and it certainly lived up to the hype.  There was an up charge to add it, but since you're eating at Le Cirque and already spending an arm and a leg, what're a few more bucks?  They give a fun little pre-dessert palate cleanser after the main courses.  No spoiler, but let's say it included a childhood candy I was not expecting to see in this restaurant.  There were a number of choices for dessert.  Wifey had the chocolate ball, which has a really cool table presentation and I had pear and caramel ice cream in a merengue.  Both were delicious.  The wine was delicious and I love the idea of having it professionally selected.  Stress-free dining!!  All in all, this was probably the best meal, start to finish, I've ever had.  That said, it was also easily the most expensive meal I've ever had.  So if you're in Vegas looking to splurge on an amazing dining experience, this is the place.",

I have had much, much better food at other restaurants of supposedly similar calibre (yes, including the Eiffel Tower restaurant across at Paris hotel in terms of food quality). I can tell you with 100% certainty the Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef they served was NOT REAL! Foie Gras was grossly undercooked. I have never seen foie gras served like that at a high end French restaurant, let alone a Michelin restaurant. Taste was strange in a bad way. Someone in my party got an upset stomach right after dining here.  If you only care about interior decor and using the finest bone China, then you may try here; although I don't understand why anyone would not care about food when they go to a restaurant.

    "text": "My fiancee and I had the pleasure of eating here for my 29th birthday tonight.  I have always wanted to eat at a Michelin star restaurant, and after reading about other restaurants in Vegas on Yelp, we chose to celebrate at Le Cirque.  We arrived 15 minutes early, and were quickly seated at our table overlooking the Bellagio Water Show.  The dining room was impeccably decorated with a playful circus decor.  Having already perused the menu online before traveling to Vegas, we knew what we wanted to order.  I chose the Degustation Menu (5-course), my fiancee went with the Pre Fixe (3-course), and we both had wine pairings.  Our meal started with an amuse-bouche: a turnip soup for her, and an oyster for myself.  This was followed by a lobster salad, and foie gras terrine for my fiancee.  Both were amazing.  The foie gras terrine was the most beautifully plated dish of the night, accompanied with a date, fruit gelee, fig jam, and a raisin brioche.  My next dish was the sauteed foie gras atop white chocolate brioche, roasted pear, and a butterscotch caramel.  It was the most amazing dish of the night - melted in your mouth like butter, just like good foie gras should.  The wine pairing was a sweet wine that accompanied the caramel/raisin very well.  This was the first time my fiancee had foie gras, and she is definitely now a fan.  My next course was sea bass with a pinot noir reduction (paired with a glass of the same pinot), and was delicious.  Our entrees came out at the same time, which was honey-glazed duck breast and duck confit for me, and the Homard Retour d'Asie for her.  The Homard was composed of Maine Lobster tail and claws, King Crab ravioli, with pureed asparagus.  Yum.  A pre-desert course consisted of a raspberry gelee with pop rocks - a nice palate cleanser.  My fiancee asked for the chocolate sphere, and I was not offered a choice.  When the deserts arrived, she got a chocolate souffle instead, and I had some sort of raspberry sorbet.  We didn't feel the need to complain about the mistake, and were not disappointed with the change - the souffle was awesome.  In addition, they brought by a tray of petit fours which were also very good.  The overall atmosphere was inviting, with a playful circus theme and great views of the Bellagio Fountain show.  The food was top notch and there was no surprise that the restaurant is a 5-diamond AAA and Michelin star recipient.  The food was easily some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.  Being from Miami, we are used to pretty lousy service, so it doesn't take much to impress us in that regard. The sommelier was very knowledgable and provided us with great parings.  There was more than ample wait staff  - it looked like there were sometimes 2 or 3 per table.  The only downside of the entire AMAZING night was the minor mistake with the dessert.  I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Vegas with a sophisticated palate and a few extra dollars - well worth it!",

    "text": "My son & I had dinner reservations for 8pm and arrived promptly. Service from the start was very good, attentive, and somewhat formal. We noticed as we were being seated the ratio of diners to staff was about 3:1, but that being said, there were still a couple of misses in the service, the first and most forgivable, as it was in our favor after all, was the double delivery of the canapes to our table, to which I advised our server that we had already been brought the canapes, the second and the one that really didn't settle well with us was the forgetfulness of the mignardises! This is my favorite and almost the most anticipated part of the meal and the last chance for the chef to leave a good impression.  I of course did not bring this to the attention of the staff, as to save mine and their embarrassment. I just couldn't bring myself to politely bring it up, so I let it be... they brought me the check, and as I paid I sadly watched the other diners tasting their mignardises... that was for me a big miss.  Regarding attire, I will say that we were probably the best dressed people there, so I doubt that had anything to do with it, there was a good amount of people in street clothing, sweats & sneakers...I'm not even joking... it True! Very badly dressed people, I'm sure it wouldn't bother most, but if I am paying that type of $$$$, I don't want to be seeing others in sweats... people should make an effort  ok, on to the food...  Coming from a day and a half of heavy eating, we decided to each go with the a la carte instead of the tasting menu... appetizer, main & dessert, which was plenty.  The bread service was ok, bacon bread was tasty but none of the offerings sampled seemed fresh, they would have really benefited from a light oven warming.  The amuse was a delightful chestnut soup. Regarding the apps ... I had emailed the restaurant 2 weeks prior requesting their Foie Terrine... to which I received no response... I had gotten very busy at work, and really just forgot to follow up, as did they. But being that it was still showing up in their online menu, I didn't really worry.  However, as I perused the menu in the restaurant, I realized there was no Foie Terrine, to which I was informed that it has been replaced with a Foie Gras Parfait... as in mixed with Heavy cream, as in Restaurant Saving $$... half the Foie, twice the profit.  I felt a bit ripped off.  I did end up ordering the Foie Parfit, which was pretty small in comparison to the pictures I've seen of the Terrine, but It was tasty & smooth... but very light in taste (obviously by the heavy cream) I would have loved the terrine, but oh well... it was served with pretty good brioche bread and atop slices of beets, to which I didn't really like... not sweet enough or tangy enough in comparison to say berries or bitter orange marmalade ... that's my fav combination!  My son had the Panko crusted egg which was superbly done, and it didn't hurt that it had a nice little dollop of caviar! I could have that for a decadent brunch anyday! For our mains, my son's Lobster was over cooked and rubbery, a sad dish and if you are going to charge a supplement ($15) you better make sure it's worth it... but it wasn't. I had the good but safe Prosciutto wrapped monkfish. Yummy, but really nothing I couldn't do at home. For dessert, son had the Chocolate Ball and I had the Grand Marnier Souffle to which we both agree were both overly sweet.  There's a word in Spanish \"empalagante\" which doesn't really have a proper translation, but really describes the desserts perfectly... Great taste, but way too sweet.  Overall, we both gave it 7 out of 10... there's plenty of room for improvement. Really want to try Twist next for excitement and Picasso for upscale \"comfort\" food.",

    "text": "I have now dined at all of the Bellagio's fine dining-level restaurants, and Le Cirque is my second favorite behind Prime.  The food was of very high quality, and the service and atmosphere was superb.  I would recommend Le Cirque if you are looking for an enjoyable and intimate dinner among the Bellagio's top notch eateries.  I opted for the a la carte menu to give myself the freedom to splurge on some highlight dishes, though there is a $72 pre-theater menu for those visiting a show afterward or a full $135 tasting menu.  The Langoustine et Caviar was an excellent appetizer--langoustine topped with caviar topped with edible gold leaf.  And unlike the gold leaf, the caviar is not just for show--it complements the langoustine well together with the shellfish champagne sauce base.  This isn't the best langoustine dish on The Strip--that honor goes to Joel Robuchon--but it certainly was no slouch in itself.  My main dish was the Le Filet de Boeuf Wagyu Japonais, which is Kobe beef tenderloin (albeit just five pieces of it) cooked just right at medium rare.  The dish comes with a few very small accompaniments: a spoonful of truffled (and very very buttery) mashed potatoes, a mushroom, and a pepper.  The portioning definitely reminded you that this was not a steakhouse, but this did not at all take away from the experience as a whole.  (I ended up getting a massive dessert, anyway.)  I would personally recommend Prime, though, if you are really looking to enjoy the quality of Japanese-imported Kobe.  Watch out for that pepper!  Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert.  I was surprised that this was offered to me after I finished my entree because the extra preparation time needed for souffles usually required it to be ordered along with the rest of your meal.  I asked about this and was assured that the wait would not be significant.  In this case, however, I was disappointingly in the right.  Once it arrived, however, it was very good--light and fluffy combined with a really good Grand Marnier sauce.  As for the other aspects of Le Cirque, the dining room seemed small (in a good way) compared to the other Bellagio restaurants, and the effect is accentuated by the circus tent canopy ceiling to go along with the circus murals on the walls.  The restaurant has a great view of the Bellagio fountains, though unless you are towards the middle of the room, your view will be obstructed by large window pillars.  The wine list is extensive and intimidating, but the sommelier's light-hearted attitude (\"Hey, it's just grape juice!\") eased the tension.  Then again, when you see the whole page of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti with prices ranging from $1,100 to several tens of thousands of dollars, you know that this is some serious grape juice.  The bread service was pretty good:  The bacon bread comes as close as anyone to the best bacon bread I've ever had (at the Caesar Palace Guy Savoy), and the rosemary bread was also very good.  Service was at a very high level--the waiter substituted a black napkin for a white one, which was the first time I explicitly noticed such a switch at a restaurant.  The final damage for one diner was $350 including tip and two wines by the glass (an excellent Sancerre to start and a robust Cabernet Sauvignon to pair with the beef tenderloin).",

My hubby was hesitant at first but after the dinner, he was blown away. Everything we had was amazing and the presentation is like art work.  I didn't want to eat it because it looked so pretty.  So we decided to go back for the second time tonight.  It was better than the first time.  Martin, our waiter is the best waiter we have ever met in all the years of dining from fast food to fine dining.  He went above and beyond his duty. Told us stories, made us laugh and was an all around an amazing human being.  Of course everyone here is amazing but Martin was an exception.    We look forward to come here everytime we comr to Vegas.  Thank you for making our dinner amazing.",

Great for a date night or special occasion. Some of the tables have a nice view of the Bellagio fountain. Service is great and unpretentious. Everything they do here is truly special. They prepare the foie gras with quinoa and crispy rice, which adds a lovely texture to the dish. It is one of my favorite preparations of foie gras.  They deliver a consistently quality dining experience, so if you need a little assistance in orchestrating a perfect night, Le Cirque is a great bet.  For dessert, skip the chocolate ball, and spring for the vacherin!",

    "text": "\"We'll always have a table for you at Le Cirque\" was the parting words from our fantastic meal.  Honestly, the chocolate coffee bread could have elevated this place to a five out of five stars.  When they offer it to you, take it!  The service was different than any other place I've been to.  It was top notch, but there was an extra factor of personality that you just don't get everywhere.  I feel I have had better service at a few other places, but those establishments had people just standing around scanning the dining room to see where they can assist.  Le Cirque was still very attentive and would be considered some of the best service if they weren't personable.  But they were...  They were all so friendly on a personalized level and I think that elevates this service above anywhere else.  We were asked to have our photo taken with our own camera so many times.  They offered, we didn't have to ask.  That just makes my wife's life so much easier.  She also tested them with this by having five thousand, three hundred and twenty-seven photos taken of us there.  When the artwork that they said was edible food was presented, we were advised to have our video camera out if we want to capture the presentation.    Every single serving of food was explained in great detail.  I heard the sommelier explain the wines to every table.  We talked to the table next to us about the meal and watched as other people ordered amazing dishes.    Lastly, I'm a big fan of ginger, so I love mule drinks.  Their mule drink had so much incredible flavor.  It was the best mule I've ever had.  The drinking vessel was this heavy copper pineapple cup, with a macaron on top of the pineapple lid.    I have only been to Las Vegas a few times, so I would rather try different places than attend the same place again.  It seems unlikely that I would return in my lifetime, but the experience was so extremely positive, that I would highly consider returning on a future visit.  I feel that speaks volumes to the experience we had.    Also, the chef signed the menu for us as an anniversary present.  We were also provided with some takeaway truffles too.  Thank you for such a personalized meal!",

    "text": "If I've ever had a better meal, I honestly don't know what it was. Though I've had meals *as good* (see my review of Kabuto from earlier that week!) but where fine dining is concerned, this one took the blue ribbon. There were a couple of minor disappointments. For example, they were out of souffle which made me very sad and earlier they put my friend's medium steak in front of me and my medium rare in front of her, but everything else was so over the top wonderful, it's easy to overlook those things.  There was one other unpleasant thing but it wasn't their fault. There was a young woman at a table near us who just glared at me the entire time she was there. I was dressed nicely, didn't arrive drunk (though I was pretty loaded by the time we left!) and used my best Emily Post type manners. I finally started making faces back at her, which actually amped up the entertainment value enormously!  I almost got up as she was leaving to thank her for keeping me so entertained.  So, the food. Dear lawd. All four of us ordered from the tasting menu and you'll have to forgive me if I forget a thing or two, but let me tell you, if you can't find food you like on here, just please go to Olive Garden and save the caviar and foie gras for people who can truly enjoy it. Because damn.  If you're a wine drinker, I highly recommend working with the somm to pick out something you'll like in your price range. He left me with the list and I summoned him back over to tell him that I had narrowed it down to two or three California Pinot Noirs. He was completely knowledgeable and helped me choose a fabulous George Vineyard, (Russian River Valley) selection. Only $150. Yes, I know that bottle can be purchased for a third of that but this is how this works. If you don't like it, don't order it.    There was an amuse bouche, with a mojito flavored grenita covered in coconut foam (I think) and decorated with gold. Just lovely.  My first course was Maryland Blue Crab with caviar. Stunning presentation, in the shell and the combination of the sweet crab with the salty caviar made me close my eyes and pray that I get to eat that again some day.  Others had the lobster and avocado salad, which I stole a bite of. Terrific. I wouldn't have traded my crab for it, but I wouldn't have been disappointed if I'd ordered it.  For the next course, two of us ordered the foie, one ordered the rissoto and one ordered the escargot. I got to taste everything and it was all perfection. Our waiter offered us a sweet wine to go with the foie (I wish I could remember what it was) and it was just stellar with that heavy foie. I could have licked the plate. I definitely didn't leave any behind.  For the fish course, I had the sea bass, encrusted in potato. I don't know how they did it and managed to get the potato fully cooked and crispy and have the fish perfectly cooked on the inside, but they did. I could eat this every day.  There were also scallops with caviar at the table for this course and they disappeared in no time - awesome.  We all ordered the wagyu for the beef course and as I said, they delivered the wrong steaks to the wrong ladies, but we're good friends so we just swapped after having taken a bite and discovering they were the wrong doneness. In the end, we could barely finish those anyway. Well, I finished mine, my friend is much smarter than I am and walked away while she could still breathe.  We all wanted souffle for dessert but he came back with bad news...no souffle.  But they brought us chocolate spheres, which were wonderful. I could only fit in a bite or two. But wow, such a presentation and such creamy, chocolatey goodness.  They also sent us off with a tiny box with two drawers in it, each containing a truffle. So sweet.   I think our waiter enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed him, either that or he's just so good at his job he can pretend to like anybody. Either way, props to him for putting up with us and taking such great care of us.  If you have the means to try this place once in your life, do it. I didn't have to pick up the check, but if I had I would have felt just fine, knowing we got the best service and best food of our lifetimes.",

    "text": "Came here trying their $72 Pre-theater 3 course Prix Fixe. I was slightly disappointed with the menu though - the items that I did want to try, for example the foie gras or the prime beef tenderloin, there was additional cost.   They came around serving us bread to start but we got to choose from  a variety - bacon cheese biscuit, coffee chocolate bread, pretzel, etc. Coffee chocolate bread was really good! They came around for seconds, and I of course, had another piece :P They also served us another appetizer on house, which was a panna cotta and salmon topped with caviar and gold flakes. This was really tasty as well.  For starters I ordered the Hamachi, Japanese yellowtail. Essentially it was like Hamachi carpaccio, served with avocado puree, mandarins, cucumbers and yuzu glaze. Not only was the presentation lovely, but the dish itself tasted really good as well, really refreshing. All the ingredients went well with each other, loved all the flavors combined. The quality of the Hamachi fish was really fresh.  For my main I ordered the \"filet de loup de mer\", which was the seabass wrapped with a thinly sliced crispy potato served on top of braised leeks and Pinot Noir verjus. This was really tasty. The seabass was cooked perfectly, the meat was tender and juicy, not dry at all. I was surprised the potato could have been made that thinly sliced to wrap the fish and surprisingly it held up crispy and wasn't soggy at all.   For dessert I ordered the chocolate ball. It was cute how they poured the hot chocolate, which melted the ball devouring it to a praline mousse with white chocolate icecream and hazelnut caramel crunches. I was really surprised that the icecream held up and didn't melt.  After dessert they also served us a dessert tray with candy gummies and macaroons. The macaroons were disappointing. I would have expected something better coming from this restaurant.  Overall the dining experience was great. The service was good, staff were really friendly. Although I didn't get to order the menu items that I originally wanted to try, all the menu items which I did try turned out to be really good.  At the end of the meal they also gave each of us a tiny box which had chocolate inside - this was cute and a nice souvenir.",

    "text": "Aw man. Awwww man. Eating this meal was a delicate balance between 'I don't know how much each bite is but I don't care' and 'This is really good so I really, actually just don't care.' Mom, Uncle, and I stopped in on this petite restaurant on a Tuesday evening in June, but I'm here writing this review because it had to be written.  AMBIENCE If you get seats by the window you have a good view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Paris Eiffel. The lighting and inner decor are reminiscent of an upscale, cozy, inner circus tent. Everything says \"Welcome to our whimsical gastronomic circus, you'll be well taken care of.\"  SERVICE Our meal was hosted by a couple of different maitre ds, one who never introduced the dishes and one who did. I preferred the latter, but other than that service left no room for complaints, perhaps the stray suggestion, and many compliments.  FOOD 5-course meal  1. Lobster Avocado Salad 2. Foie Gras 3. Sea Bass 4. Lamb  5  Panna Cotta  Given the chance between 3-course and 5-course, the three of figured \"Well, you know, we're here already so might as well make the most of it.\" (The following will be in the order that I preferred the dishes, on a scale of impressed to 'I will never forget about this.') Starting out, the salad had giant chunks of lobster, married well with the buttery avocado. Really fresh taste. Main plate, lamb, was a bit underwhelming after the stellar foie gras and sea bass. Uncle ordered the wagyu beef instead of lamb, which I personally feel wasn't worth the extra $100. The sea bass was dense and flaky, but personally I was more interested in how that glossy wine sauce was made. It didn't have that wine dryness at the back of the throat as many wine sauces do; rather, the well-rounded acidity went with the crisp exterior of the fish like Forest and Jenny Gump.  Now. That kaffir lime bay leaf lemongrass tapioca foie gras was crazy. Probably one of the most amusing things to eat -- there were so many different elements that worked together in that dish. So much praise to the creative person who masterminded this dish, because I would have never thought the bright notes of Southeast Asia would complement the richness of foie gras. What easily gets too rich and difficult to eat, I finished in a heartbeat. French tradition with a twist, this creation gave me the greatest impression of Le Cirque.   Everything came out beautifully plated, especially the panna cotta. (Now, I had a long internal discussion on which dessert to get because literally everything sounded amazing. Mom went for their famous chocolate ball, and I couldn't help but go for my favorite dessert.) The milky-white jelly came out with beautiful edible flowers and granita lined along the edges of the plate, reminding me of a beach scene, panna cotta washing up against the floral sands. Texturally, this dessert couldn't be beat -- there was the crunch from the granita, softness from the panna cotta, and florals from the flower petals. Delicate and refreshing dessert!  If you win some moolah at the casinos and want to splurge on a nice dinner, rest assured you'll have a good time here.",

The food is always exquisite at Le Cirque both in New York and Las Vegas but on this particular night what made our experience extra special was the incredible professionalism and attention to detail of Charlyn who was behind the bar.   She knew every nuance of each course like any waiter in the dining room yet she was also managing and preparing every drink being ordered all night.  She was really on the ball but she was also very kind and helpful to people who weren't as familiar with some of the ingredients in each course of their dinner.   She was great. On a related note: a specific challenge to having a very high end restaurant in the middle of a casino is that there's a lot of foot traffic coming in and asking to see the menu or if they serve spaghetti.  Being at the bar I watched it consistently for 3 hours and every time someone came in to make a general inquiry I was stricken by how respectful and nice the Le Cirque people at the front desk were in every instance.  We left beyond ecstatic with the whole experience.",

From the warm greeting by our hostesses to our promenade into the dining room, every step was marked by the distinctive aura of elegance. We were fortunate to be tended to by a superb team of professionals: our server, our sommelier to culinary attendants who seemed to glide through and around the dining room to check up on their guests -- superb! Every detail was intentional, lovely blooms from the botanical gardens within the Bellagio, gentle candlelight so as not to distract from the \"big top circus\" interior and the whimsical tableware. The menu selection was a 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing and every plate and glass of wine was rightfully and incrementally, more delectable than it's predecessor. What made my experience even more pleasant, was the good cheer and humor of the gentlemen that tended to our table and that made all the difference. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this fine restaurant to prospective patrons looking for a formal dining experience who appreciate whimsy and flair.",

    "text": "My dinner experience at Le Cirque was one of those that was so good I'll remember it for years.  The food: They have a tasting menu and an ala carte menu.  We did the ala carte menu.  However, they provided a small appetizer which was a butternut squash soup with mini marshmallows.  It was soooooooo good.  If it was a regular menu item, I would've ordered a gallon of it.    For the main course, I had the Coeur de Filet de Boeuf which was to die for.  The portion was not to big and the foie gras that came on the side was excellent.    For dessert, they gave each table a cute tray with assorted petite fours.  I tried one or two of them and they were excellent.  My boyfriend had the chocolate souffle which was perfect, the level of sweetness was just right.  I had the creme brulee which was perfect, it came with a small scoop of lemon gelato that was topped with edible gold... yes, that's right, edible gold.  Finally, they do give each table a really cool gift box that has two delicious truffles.  The food was excellent and you could tell they put a lot of thought into their dishes.  Service: Truly amazing.  I was a little worried that my boyfriend and I were going to deal with condescending waiters who would label us as young kids who had no business in being in a frou frou restaurant.  This was not the case at all.  Everyone was polite and courteous and we got the same level of service that the other customers got.  Every staff member knew where they had to be and you could see how everything worked like clockwork.  Ambiance:  Its a small restaurant which for me, made me feel special.  It's circus themed with the ceiling looking like a tent top.  Paintings are of circus scenes.  My favorite thing though were the dishes.  They were monkey themed and I am the hugest monkey fan.  The restaurant has a view of the Bellagio fountains.  After my experience, I understand why this restaurant is a 5 star award winner.  While the prices may scare you away, I say its worth going and checking out.  It will definitely be one of your most memorable meals.",

The other signature dishes, the lobster salad, the rabbit stew, and chilean seabass were not outstanding. In fact, the duck and lamb dishes outshined the signature dishes. I would do the $98 Pre-fixe dinner over the tasting menu. The main dining room is stunning, with the view of water show. Be sure to request during reservations or risk being seated outside the main dining room near the entrance. Service was good but they do not fawn over you like in finer restaurants.

    "text": "An upfront warning - these events happened a few years ago. This isn't meant to be a current review, but an overview of the class and integrity of the restaurant and its management.   As gourmands, my wife and I enjoy Las Vegas for it's abundance of high quality restaurants.  The couple we were with are of the same mind, so we visited Le Cirque with high expectations. The decor (circus tent ala Donald Trump), service and food were all that we had hoped for - until my wife noticed her entree wasn't what she ordered.   She had ordered the Sonoma Lamb; when it came, it looked suspiciously like veal.  My wife doesn't eat veal, so we call the waiter over for confirmation.  Sure enough, they had run out of lamb and the chef had substituted (without asking) the veal.  Our waiter said this was SOP for the restaurant - the chef decided what to serve if your order wasn't available.   Naturally my wife was irritated, and sent back the entree for another lamb order.  The rest of us had finished our dinners before hers came back - and it was the sorriest piece of meat I've seen served this side of Denny's.  Since I had initially encouraged her to accept the veal, this became my fault and the evening was ruined.  We ended up paying the bill (a small fortune) and leaving no tip for the waiter.   When we got home I wrote letters of complaint to the Bellagio, Le Cirque Las Vegas, and the original Le Cirque in New York.  Imagine my surprise when I received a response from all three.  New York's response came first, and offered a free lunch whenever we were in town.  Then Las Vegas' letter came in the mail, offering a complimentary dinner the next time we visited.  It was a few months later, but we returned to the Bellagio and took them up on the offer.  My wife got her Sonoma Lamb, I got a Staglin Cellars cab (which I expected to pay for), and we got the dining experience we had hoped for the first time - all comped.  The icing on the cake was that our waiter from the first time was standing in the corner - we called him over and gave him the tip he deserved from the first meal.  A long after the fact review, but I hope it encourages you to visit an establishment that stands behind its reputation.",

I was incredibly fortunate to be invited by some friends to go on a Vegas vacation for a couple days and on our first night, we were treated like spoiled princes and princesses at Le Cirque.   The restaurant is very high class with such an authentic Parisian atmosphere. I've traveled to Paris twice and I can quite honestly say that this little restaurant tucked away in the busy Bellagio casino lives up to its international competition. I was completely blown away by their menu. Our party ordered four different appetizers our waiter so knowledgeably recommended. You can't go to a French restaurant and not order the escargot. And their lobster risotto was just mouth-watering delicious (this was just the appetizer!) Let's not forget the yellowtail hamachi and scallops.....dude this place was unreal.   For entrees, we each ordered something different (our party of 10). I ordered the duck and my GOODNESS I was floored by how tender and flavorful it was. There was a breaded and fried grape (singular) on the side as well. You could probably imagine my surprise when I cut this little fried ball in half to discover a green and sweet center. Seriously, what a delight. I also tried my friend's kobe beef. I LOVE kobe beef and this place just upped it to a whole new level of love.   Dessert. My kryptonite. I shared a chocolate sphere with a friend. If you're ever as lucky as me, I highly HIGHLY recommend the chocolate sphere. The description of the dessert described this as \"hazelnut ice cream with caramel nougat enveloped in a chocolate shell\". Okay yeah, sounds good. But it's very deceiving because when our waiter served the dessert, he made a little joke asking us \"do you like the sphere?\" (it literally came as a chocolate sphere the size of a large fist). Then he proceeds to tell us, \"yeah you like it? well I'm going to destroy it\". I honestly got a little sad when he said this but THEN he pours hot melted chocolate on top of our sphere and the whole chocolate sphere begins to melt all around, revealing the hazelnut ice cream in the center. The effect was never-before-seen. And plus, each girl received a small chocolate box. Like seriously, this place was unbelievably delicious and it was one of the most surreal experiences I've ever been apart of. I owe it all to my friends who made it possible.   I apologize for pulling a Tim Lam (he writes the longest reviews) but this place deserves high praise. In all honesty, this was the best dinners I've ever had at a restaurant (I emphasize \"restaurant\" because my mom cooks like a culinary goddess) and it wasn't even because I had two martinis plus champagne :]   Treat yourself the next time you visit Las Vegas. This place is unforgettable.",

While they do not have San Pelligrino (they serve another type of sparkling water), they offered to go to other restaurants to find San Pelligrino if needed.  They also recognized diners for a few months ago, which I though was very nice.  Anyways, on to the food.  We did the pre-theatre menu. Our amuse bouche was a english pea soup and a croquete of something tasty but I do not recall the details. My husband had the beef tartare and I had the lobster bisque.  Both were perfect.  The beef tartare had a perfect mixture of beef and greens and they were paired perfectly with the lotus chips.  We did not even touch the accompanying toast because we did not need them.  The lobster bisque was lick-your-plate clean good.    For our main courses we had the salmon and beef tenderloin.  The salmon was good, but the beef tenderloin was the star.  It was the best piece of meat we have had in several years.  It was perfectly medium rare.  When I cut it and saw the texture I almost cried from how beautiful it was (just kidding, but I imagine a steak lover somewhere would).  My husband sat around with a goofy grin for the next half hour because he was so happy from eating it.    The dessert was so creative, BUT TASTY.  Some \"fancy\" restaurants make the mistake of being creative and weird tasting (I'm looking at you Le Meurice with your bee pollen dish aka assault on the tastebuds). One was a chocolate ball that came out in a beautiful globe that was promptly melted away by hot fudge to reveal vanilla ice cream and chocolate/hazelnut. As my husband put it \"a giant delicious ferraro rocher.\"  I was presented with a coconut.  When the lid came off, I saw a sea of beautiful white foam.  It was COCONUT FOAM.  If you tasted just the foam itself, it was delicious!  But combined with the pineapple sorbet and the fruit hiding underneath... heavenly.  I like food, and my husband usually just comes along to these \"fancy\" restaurants to appease me, but this time he was also very happy.  yay for you, Le Cirque!",

Our first stop in this over-the-top, circus theme decorated restaurant, was the beautiful semi-circle bar with the inviting striped high chairs.  We ordered and enjoyed our drinks while waiting for our table to be prepared. Once ready, we were whisked away to our table in the intimate dining room with the circus tent above.  Since our dinner here was a few months ago during summer, I can't/won't go into detail on the dishes we had.  But I can tell you that we both ordered the LeCirque Tasting menu, and enjoyed just about every dish that came our way.  We did the wine pairing as well, and the wines were exceptional.  The sommelier provided stories, laughter, and a good education on the wines that were served.  Depending on your table location, you may also have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains through the restaurant windows. We loved the experience, it was just fun.  And I like when a fine dining experience can be fun and not just stuffy.",

It sounded great but the flavors just didn't gel.  Perhaps it's because it was served too cold.  I had the rabbit for my main course and my husband had the duck.  The rabbit dish was very creative and delicious.  The duck was pretty good.  The best course, by far, was the dessert.   Overall, however, the food was forgettable.  For the price, it just wasn't worth it.",

    "text": "My first Le Cirque experience was ephipanal. Between the service, decor and the food, I couldn't have been more beside myself. So, when out of town friends suggested we treat ourselves to dinner, I was only too ready to hit this baby up again.   Sadly, I was disappointed the second time. I decided on the $98 three-course standard (a pretty good deal for an app, entree and dessert at a Michelin star resto). The amuse that started the meal was heavenly....a shot of organic tomato soup and a little crab cake. Delish. The uni risotto, however, left much to be desired. The risotto itself was more than al dente... it wasn't really cooked. The uni sauce in which the risotto sat was incredibly heavy... so heavy, in fact, that it was congealing on the plate. Yuck.  The scallops served atop the risotto were great.. I only wish there were more on the plate. After the risotto, my expectations for the main course were low. Thankfully, the sea bass wrapped in a thin potato skin was great, though the fish was slightly overcooked. Because we were a large group, the 10 of us split a fantasy dessert -- every dessert on the menu. While most of the desserts were ok, the stand out was the grand marnier souffle (the yuzu/passion fruit dessert, however, was a major miss).   But here's the real rub: at some point during the meal, one of the waiter dropped a dollop of a buttery, cream sauce on the back of my husband's silk shirt. When I asked one of the waiters to help with getting club soda, he looked at me like I had two heads! After discussing the matter with the restaurant manager, he graciously adjusted the check by $50. That said, rookie mistakes at this type of resto are really inexcusable.   The star of the show was the fantastic sommalier: Frank. If you're lucky enough to be dining when he's working, ask him to share his thoughts about Vegas with you. He is absolutely fantastic.",

I had the beet risotto with goat cheese which was my favorite dish overall. I also had the sea bass as the entree and the chocolate ball as desert. Both were wonderful! My husband had the rabbit three ways, which was the first time he'd had rabbit and still is not sure if any other rabbit could compare! He had the foie gras for the appetizer which was another first and did not disappoint. The waiter gave us his True opinion about the foie gras and how it might not be for everyone. We appreciated his candidness and interest in our experience. The staff was very nice and polite. I did feel, though, once a certain customer came in, which seemed to be an important person, I felt like our service went down because the focus went to that person. I figured I was paying for a fine dining restaurant also and should have the same amount of attention. Otherwise the food was exemplary and worth the experience.

    "text": "The below is just one person's experience and from the looks of the avg diner, it seems like it's a restaurant worth trying.    Vegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.",

    "text": "This is the most expensive restaurant I've been to so far and I am not really sure if I am expecting too much or too little....my ideal rating for this place would be 3 1/2 stars but I'll round up because they had some \"surprise elements\" (more on this on the bottom) that I wasn't expecting and it was a good touch.  - 1 star for the super slow and unattentive service that almost made us miss our 9:30pm show and we started eating at 6:30! I had to flag them down so many times. I had even told them I had a 9:30 show in the beginning and the waiter assured us that we will make it.  All dishes but 1 was perfect for us (this is what i had wanted to take off the 1/2 star for). My fiancee had ordered escargot for appetizers and it was SO buttery and salty. You couldn't taste much aside from the butter. The portion was generous...but he couldn't finish eating it because it was so salty and buttery.  Everything else was perfectly delightful but the highlights -  Lobster Salad Black Truffle Dressing - Generous portions of lobster, flavorful but light dressing, delicious and so beautifully presented.   Beef Tenderloin, Sauteed Foie Gras, Smoked Serrano Potato Croquette, Sweet Onion Compote Supp. - The foie gras was perfectly cooked with a thin crunchy layer and a very generous portion. A very good \"first time\" with foie gras. My steak is cooked to a perfect medium rare....drooling as I speak...  Napoleon of Melon, Chilled Midori Melon Soup - This is incredibly refreshing! I loved the cantaloupe sorbet atop watermelon. It was both visually pleasing and awesome way to finish up dinner.   The \"surprise elements\" that I mentioned earlier were that we got to do some sampling of some of the chef's new dishes and got a tray of Petite Fours after our dessert and finally a darling little jewelry box with 2 drawers- containing one delicious chocolate truffle in each drawer. A perfect way to end a dinner...if you didn't have to catch a show.",

    "text": "Le Cirque offered me one of the WORST experiences in my life.  We had scoped out Vegas for our wedding dinner, and we were trying different restaurants in the area.  One of them was Le Cirque's sister restaurant, Circo, which is also in the Bellagio.  We contacted the new assistant manager (who was in charge of booking their room for wedding dinners), and she reserved our dinner of 4 at Circo.  My fiancee and I went along with our sister and brother-in-law.  The four of us were completely underwhelmed by the meal.  First, there weren't that many people in the restaurant, which made it a bit depressing.  Second, the service was off - I don't know if the wait staff was preoccupied or what, but they were not attentive.  Third, and most importantly, the food was not great.  It was mediocre.  Pasta that was overcooked, entrees bland, and even down to COLD coffee.    We paid the bill.  And then the new manager came by and asked us what we thought about booking the place for our wedding, and we told her all of our concerns above.  She apologized for Circo's disappointing performance and asked us to come back and try LE CIRQUE.  She said she would set it up and that it would be \"on her,\" i.e., no charge.  We took her up on her offer.  A few nights later, we went back to Le Cirque, but the new manager was not on duty.  No problem, right?  The maitre d' said he had our reservation and that the new manager had told him about us.  Not wanting to be greedy about it, it was just the 2 of us without in-laws.  We sat down and had a pretty good meal, but we noticed the waiters came by and kept pushing add-ons and extras on us.  The sommelier likewise kept passing by and offering us wine after wine.  We wanted to stay sober and judge the food on the merits because this was for our wedding after all.  We had some rabbit ans spaetzel and some other dishes.  HERE'S THE KICKER.  At the end of the meal, the maitre d' came by and put down the folder holding the check.  I thought this was so we could see the total and TIP the waiters.  After all, even though the manager said the meal was \"on her,\" the waiters should still get their tips for serving us.  The waiters were not that great, but we were going to give them 20% anyway.  THE SHOCKER:  We didn't eat that much, but the bill still totaled $430.  I took out $80 for the tip and gave it to the maitre d' and explained again that the manager said the meal was \"on her.\"  He said, \"I don't know anything about that.  You have to pay the bill.\"  That's when I said, \"Not a chance.\"  I told him to call up the manager and confirm.  They made us wait about 10 minutes, and then he returned and said he couldn't find the manager.  The waiter and the maitre d' then attempted to humiliate us in front of everyone else by saying, \"You paid at Circo, right?  So now you pay at Le Cirque.\"  I flat out refused and told them I was NOT paying a penny other than the tip.  They were complete a-holes.  My fiancee was so upset that she told me she was going to pay.  I wouldn't let her.  After another 10 minutes of holding us hostage, the maitre d' finally let us leave with dirty looks.  Like we were escaped convicts or something.  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS POOR TREATMENT ON ANYONE ELSE.  THE EPILOGUE:  We tried e-mailing and calling the manager, and we left her messages telling her what happened and how pissed off we were.  HER RESPONSE:  She sent an e-mail asking if we wanted to book Le Cirque for our wedding dinner.   She's got some nuts, doesn't she?  MY RESPONSE:  GO TO HELL, LE CIRQUE.",

    "text": "The number one thing that makes this restaurant amazing is the service. We aren't talking polite and attentive wait staff, we are talking truly amazing service. They replace your napkin with a fresh, folded one when you get up to go to the bathroom. Your drinks magically meet you at your table from the bar. They pour all your cocktails right in front of you, even at your table. All this in addition to friendly and attentive wait staff that you would expect.  The reason I'm rating this restaurant 4 instead of 5 stars is honestly because of the food. There were things I tried that were out of this world, and then others that were good but not great. We ate at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant the night before and honestly I felt that I enjoyed the food better there. The one part of the meal that was head and shoulders above anything else we had was dessert. Presentation was outstanding, and it wasn't just about the plating. I ordered the chocolate ball, a seemingly solid and perfectly round chocolate dessert topped with gold leaf. My perfect sphere was then bathed in a rich, hot chocolate sauce, melting away the spherical exterior to reveal still frozen white chocolate ice cream and pralines. Truly spectacular to watch and eat.  Overall, the meal was amazing. Obviously you have to expect to pay an arm and a leg here, so don't even bother on commenting about it being overpriced or not. You pay for the service and ambiance (something not found many other places in Vegas) in addition to the quality food. Definitely a great experience.",

Well, this is not off the beaten path and felt the same. Server was very vague about two menus, so much so that I did not realize the only menu he had given me was full of supplemental charges, above the price my sister had already paid. Only one copy of our intended menu was given to us, put aside like an afterthought. I mistakenly chose an entree not on the deal for a $33 upcharge and did not know it. My lobster avocado starter was very good, my lamb was good, otherwise more about presentation than astonishing flavors. My sister's salad was miniscule and her generous portion of chicken was dry and flavorless. No drinks and over a $200 dinner. What a disappointing way to end the trip.",

The restaurant is very small so I definitely recommend reservations, but they do have tables that can accommodate larger groups. The windows look out to the Bellagio fountains so if you're there long enough you'll get a peek at the show.  For starters we had the Escargot and the Risotto. The Risotto was cooked perfectly and the Escargot was a delicious departure from the standard butter and garlic-soaked escargot I've had in the past. Don't get me wrong, I really love garlic and butter and Le Cirque's dish had it's fair share, but with a lovely sophisticated twist.   For mains we had the Filet de Loup de Mer and the Wild Scottish Salmon. Both were beautifully presented and equally as delicious. We had a wonderful selection of desserts, including a banana souffle...I highly recommend ended your meal with one of their souffles, they are fantastic!  Super convenient high-end spot for dinner before catching Cirque de Soleil's \"O\" at the Bellagio! Definitely a place to bring someone you're looking to impress!",

Carl took fantastic care of us along with the rest of the staff.  I ordered the Digestion prix fixe menue with the wine pairing as I did last time.  Expensive, yes, but compared to comparable meals in Vegas for the same money it is still the best bargain for the number of courses and quality of food.   In a nutshell, this is the best fine French meal you will find in Vegas for the money.  You can find several more places in Vegas to spend more (much more!) and maybe they will be better meals and experiences, but as far as I\"m concerned, I'm VERY happy with Le Cirque and will return.  I think you will be too.  Ask for Carl.  He will take great care of you and his personality is great.  Enjoy.",

My husband had a wonderful salad that was unlike others he had ever had and he enjoyed every bit.  For the main course, I selected  the Chilean Sea Bass, with Herb & Ginger, Hon Shimeji Mushrooms, Swiss Chard, Citrus Vinaigrette. It was wonderful.  My husband enjoyed the Wagyu kobe beef that was surely one of the best meals he has ever enjoyed.    Our desserts, a beautiful strawberry mixture served in an ice bowl was beautiful and delicious.  My \"chocolate ball\" was presented beautifully, with hot chocolate poured over it to uncover a delicious ice cream dessert inside, topped with a small piece of gold leaf.  We will return again and again...what a treat!  Our compliments to the chef and the very attentive staff.",

I was impressed the first time and decided I wanted to treat my father to a nice meal for our first time going to Vegas together (father and son time). I made a mistake and accidently called the le cirque in new york when googling the number for le cirque (at that time i assumed there was only one le cirque). When we arrived to dinner (assuming we had reservations), we were involved in a very confusing situation where i thought we had reservations but didn't as i had unknowingly called the one in New York. The manager wasn't very nice about the whole situation (I wish i asked for his name, It was not the French manager he was very polite my last visit) I was polite and was not rude while he was defensive and seemed very agitated. Anyways, the restaurant was full but they offered a table behind the cashier/waiter's station so we took it. As i was seated I investigated the number I called and that's when I realized the mistake I had made and this is where my issues with the restaurant began....   I called the manager over so I can explain the mix up as I thought it was sort of funny and he responded in a condescending way \"Yes I told you, we never make mistakes\" and walked away.   The second thing that happened that night was my father and I were getting a weird vibe from the waiters, us being seated behind their station, we were able to hear them talking about us when we realized that they thought we were a couple. My father and I were embarrassed and he asked the waiter \"Can you take a picture of my son and I\" so the waiters would know we were related. Right after taking the picture he went back a couple feet to his station and told another waiter \"They're father and son\".  I understand that gossip at work is normal and unavoidable, however, I believe it was disrespectful to be gossiping about us feet away where we could hear. And now i wonder what gossiping occurs when seated in the actual dining room.   This service greatly affected our dining experience as we did not enjoy our meal. Which is sad as there are many other restaurants in Las Vegas that would have treated us better. I have been to many great restaurants such as Alinea, The Cut, Wp24, Mastros, etc. and have never experienced such an awful service experience such as this one. I believe service is equally important as the quality of the food, a dining experience can be horrible if either one is poor. Since this experience my family and I have never returned and never plan on returning, they could offer me a free meal and I wouldn't accept it.",

    "text": "Le Cirque gets huge points for being super vegetarian friendly, sort of.  When I was first seated, I asked the waiter what my vegetarian options were.  The only one on the menu was a mixed green salad and there was no way that I would order that for $100 dinner.  So, French-waiter-man rattled off some options and when he got to truffle pasta or truffle risotto my dining companions got all giddy.  I decided on ravioli for a starter and, based on peer pressure, truffle risotto for my main dish.   The ravioli was really good, but the sauce was supposed to be herb-something and instead was butter thickened with butter (much like at Cuistot).   The risotto was a large portion completely covered with truffles.  It was incredibly rich and very good, but I could only eat about 1/3, so I took the rest home.   Some of the dessert options were odd - strawberry soup?  Midori melon something? They do have souffles, which one in my party ordered.  It was fine but nothing fantastic.  The coffee ice cream was fine but nothing fantastic. I had a praline mousse which was also, nothing fantastic.  I think the goal might be to be totally full by the time dessert comes because it wasn't that exciting.  Most of the petit fours received the table's approval except a yucky strawberry-marshmallow-thing. As for the basics, the bread basket is good - rustic white, olive or pretzel bread.  They push water like you wouldn't believe.  If you order sparkling water for a table of four, they automatically bring out two bottles and fill large glasses completely full which is kind of annoying.  Also annoying is how they are constantly fussing over you, pouring a splash of wine because you took one sip.  My least favorite of all fussing is when they fold your napkin/replace your napkin while you are off in the restroom.  SO THEN THE CHECK COMES and there is a $62 surcharge for the truffle risotto.  No one said anything about a surcharge when offering truffle risotto as a vegetarian option.  I get that truffles are expensive, but rice isn't, so the only ingredient that cost any money in my risotto was the truffles.  $170 for ravioli, risotto and mousse, really?  This was the first time ever that I wasn't a cheap date.",

Everyone that attended to us was professional and pleasant with exception of main waiter. He was pleasant, but made some comments one would take as racist. He asks me about fried chicken and being a female of color, I didn't notice it until after he left that he asks about fried chicken from all the foods in the world. When told I was Latina, he got quiet and walked away. Later on, we heard him making comments about another patron in the main room about his breath being bad and that a mint couldn't help or save him. We were shocked at his behavior and words that were not whispered to his fellow co-worker who remained quiet and continued providing excellent service to the patrons. It is an expensive restaurant so be ready to spend for a great meal. I will recommend this restaurant for fine dining and hopefully the waiter keeps his personal thoughts to himself or low enough so nobody eating can hear.",

    "text": "I have always heard of the Le Cirque in NY but haven't gone yet. The one in Vegas was A+! The decor of the dining area was beautiful, the ceiling has pieces of colorful fabric artfully draped on the ceiling, meeting in the center. You have a great view of the water show that goes on every 15 minutes in Lake Bellagio. The food is divine and they give very generous portions. I was full after my lobster salad appetizer. Which was so delicous I inhaled it. I then had to try to dig into my beef tenderloin with foie gras on top but I could only manage to eat half of it. It was good, big piece of meat, I was just too full. But I had to make room for dessert. We all got different items. The best one was the tropical one served in a coconut shell. The flavors in there were just so well married together. It was bursting with flavors and just so pleasing to the palette. I have never tasted anything like it before! We had an exceptional meal here. It was definitely memorable and now I can't wait to go to the one in NY!",

Almost all in my party chose to order from the three-course $105 prix fixe menu (I had our server surprise me with my order: lobster and truffle salad, three preparations of rabbit, and a chocolate cake with bananas foster- all very good, the rabbit a little on the game-y side but still wonderfully prepared), but an adventurous one ordered the $145 tasting menu and I would absolutely order the same next time. If I remember correctly, it started with an oyster topped with caviar, then a smaller preparation of my lobster salad, a risotto covered with a layer of truffle shavings, a generous portion of seared foie gras, a perfectly cooked sea bass, filet mignon, a sorbet, and then a bread pudding type dessert. I was fortunate enough to get a taste of almost everything and the risotto and filet were incredible. The foie gras was really beyond words- incredibly rich and melt-in-your-mouth-y.   I loved the handpainted plates with whimsical illustrations and fresh flowers at every table, perfectly matched with the jewel-toned decor. Vegas (and especially the Bellagio) really takes all dining experiences to another level and that's certainly True at Le Cirque.",

The wait staff had the nerve to talk sh*t about a friend that was having a great (loud) time at our table in French. Little did they know that 2 people including myself spoke French so we became louder and stayed WAY beyond our welcome. I didn't see any other table drop $$$ on Caviar or Magnums so why tell our table to behave? Other than that, the meal was good. My favorite from the tasting menu is the Canard & Foie Gras.

    "text": "While I feel I got reasonable value out my $98 pre-theater menu + wine pairing with respect to Las Vegas extreme pricing, I do not feel I ate at the same restaurant as other reviewers.  The decor was spectacular with the modern circus theme and the backdrop of the Bellagio fountains.  I was placed at a table against a wall, with tables immediately to the left and right of me.  This was a enjoyable spot while those adjacent tables were empty, but when two couples were seated at both sides, I felt like all privacy was lost.  The tables were close together a la NYC, where I felt like I was involved in the surrounding conversations.  The bread course was pretty good. Although I can't remember  specifically the breads I picked, I think these were well formed French breads with a nice crust and crumb.  The amuse bouche was a chilled canteloupe  soup which was very nice and was the standout of of my meal. Complements to the chef.  The rest of the meal becomes a little on the mediocre side, and I feel like I payed for what I got (again relative to Vegas high prices).  The risotto from the pre-theater menu I believe (and I could be mistaken) was a mushroom risotto and not the truffle risotto from the a la carte menu.  It was good enough relative to quality Italian restaurant, but not a standout in the scheme of high end Vegas eateries    The pot-au-feu was not to exciting either.   The rib meat was served in a simple clear beef broth accompanied with a a few slivers of beet, snap peas, and a bone marrow.  The meat was cooked just fine, soft and tender as short ribs should be, but the broth was underwhelming and the vegetables were a bit bland.  I won't comment much on the bone marrow, as I have no experience with bone marrow.  To me, it wasn't as exciting or tasty as what folks on the food channel parlay, but that could just be me.  The chocolate souffle, was good, but again not anything that stands out. If anything, the dessert portion was too big, and I felt sick afterwards.  I would have rather had cheeses, but in general I prefer a savory cheese dish for after the meal than a sweet thing.  The wine pairing was nothing to complain about. For $30, I got nothing spectacular, but complemented classic French/Italian fare just fine.  In summary, I felt like the highlight of the meal was the ambiance, and even that was destroyed at the end of the meal by the emplacement of people at the all too close adjacent tables.  The food was on par with a decent local French restaurant in any major city or suburb, and with the pre-theater pricing, the total bill wasn't much worse than what I would get at that local French restaurant.  I would recommend, but don't expect to be mesmerized by the pre-theater menu. Perhaps the a la carte menu is more of a standout!",

For starters, the service was amazing.  Our server, Martin, was very attentive towards our needs and is quite a conversationalist. He made sure we were comfortable and that we were well taken care of. The food itself was amazing.  We had only ordered entree but they started us off with an appetizer which had names I can't even remember.  I do remember a soup served in a cappuccino cup with a tiny cube of cake next to it. My first thought was \"Great, another tiny french meal.\"  I'm glad they only gave us that tiny cube because it packed quite a punch. Unfortunately, everything was in French and I didn't even try to remember the name.  My entree was a monk fish wrapped in Prosciutto.  I can't believe how well made the fish was.  It also had a side of turnip puree which was great! To finish everything off, they offered us complementary dessert.  Everything about the meal was fantastic. The meal was a little pricey, but it was a good thing that they offered pre-theatre prices.",

We were a group of 10 on a Saturday night, so I was worried that they would not be able to accommodate us. Everything worked out perfectly though! Our somm Fred was very knowledgeable, and our table host was also excellent. I had the citrus risotto, chicken, and chocolate ball from the pre-theater menu. All were excellent - particularly the chicken and chocolate ball - the chocolate tasted high quality, and was appreciated. The one issue that we had was that we were not told we would be charged for water, and would have been happy with tap water if that was offered to us - instead we ended up paying over $70 for water, which seems silly. Overall though, a great experience and would recommend. It was great for a large group, but I imagine would be even better in a small group or as a couple.",

After looking at many many yelp reviews we made reservations here for Saturday night at 8:15pm.  We were seated after a few minutes and we all ordered the 5 course degustation menu.  3 of us had the sommelier wine pairing and one of us had the premium wine pairing.    The amuse bouche was a galette with goat cheese and something crunchy.  It was really delicious and definitely amused my mouth.  We were also offered several types of bread: french, pretzel, bacon, rosemary, and chocolate.  The french bread was standard, the pretzel bread was pretty good, the bacon bread was super bacon-y, and the chocolate was the clear winner.  It had some nuts, which gave it a nice change of texture and the chocolate was subtle.  Very good!  Great start to our meal.  For the first course, one of us got the country egg with caviar (additional $15 charge) and it looked really good! The rest of us got the snow crab.  This was my second favorite course of the night.  The snow crab was wrapped in avocado and was covered in delicious sauce and some roe.  The result was a creamy delicious light crab flavor.  SO GOOD!!  For the second course, most of us ordered the foie gras and one of us ordered the langostine.  After tasting the foie gras, I asked to taste my husband's langostine.  As he looked longingly at my dish, the amazing balance of flavors on his dish overwhelmed me and I quickly said, \"let's switch!\" The boys all really liked the foie gras, but it was a bit too sweet for my tastes.  The langostine tasted beautiful.  It was my favorite dish last night.  The third course: 2 of us got the sea bass wrapped in potato and 2 of us got the barramundi.  The barramundi was the winner of this round.  It was tender and flavorful.  The sea bass was a bit dry and not as flavorful as the barramundi.  For the fourth course, 2 of us got the duck and 2 of us got the pork.  At this point in the meal, we were getting pretty full.  The duck and pork were both alright; the pork was slightly better.  It could have used more seasoning.  For dessert, we had been eyeing other tables and there was this really cool presentation where there was a chocolate ball, they poured chocolate sauce on it and the ball melted.  SO COOL! I definitely had to get that.  Someone else got the banana souffle and another person got the sugar sphere with chocolate and cherries inside.  The chocolate ball was amazing as was the souffle.  The sugar sphere was a very interesting presentation, but the taste was just okay.    Service was incredible throughout the meal.  The dining area is a little bit loud so I had to shout a little bit to our waiter.  The sommelier was so awesome! He would swing by our table to explain the wines, drop some knowledge, and tell us an entertaining story.  Turns out, he lived in the Philippines for 11 years and he spoke Tagalog to me! To hear a Frenchman speak in Tagalog.  That's the dream.  The wine pairings were all incredible and paired well with the food.    OH! Also the greatest  thing ever! They give all female diners a little jewelry box with truffles in them at the end of the meal! I felt so appreciated!   Overall, it was a great dining experience.  The husband and I ended up paying $500, which was definitely a splurge.  However, I liked the food at Providence (in LA) better, but that's just because I'm partial to seafood.  We had a great time and a great, albeit expensive, experience.",

    "text": "Exceptional food and sensational service!  Five diamond restaurant indeed.  My husband and I had only 48 hours in Vegas and the only place we crossed our fingers and toes on getting a reso was for dinner at Le Cirque and lucky us, we got one on the evening before we left the city.  We both chose the 3 course prix fixe menu.  Portions were perfect and all guests were surprised with a beautiful complimentary amuse bouche of a citrus foam inside the shell of an egg atop a slight sweetened carrot puree, cucumber and was it coriander or cilantro? Delicious! Looked intimidating at first as i was expecting a gooey texture but this was the perfect way to start the meal.  Our first courses came:  I had the Japanese yellowtail with hearts of palm, avocado mousse and yuzu vinaigrette.  My better half had the fois gras...omg soooo decadent and delicious!  For mains we had a seabass wrapped on potato on a bed of leeks and also the lamb three ways with thumbelina carrots.  All the plating looked like they used kitchen tweezers and placed every ingredient on there with love.  You can taste the love they put in the food here!  Palette cleanser came in a beautiful gold pineapple with ice and two little spheres that looked like truffles. We popped it in our mouths to experience a refreshing pineapple lavender shot to prepare us for our decadent desserts.  We had a chocolate souffle with a vanilla bean ice cream as well as a chocolate ball with ice cream that tasted like a ferrero rocher...so good.  The service...so refreshing to be in the food industry and not be disappointed with service.  We toasted quietly to our anniversary 'plus one month...plus a couple of days' at the beginning of the meal and when our desserts landed we were blown away.  Our desserts each had a little plaque that said Happy Anniversary, not only that but we were astonished by the waiter wishing us...and i quote 'happy anniversary...plus one month...plus a couple of days!' When he placed the desserts down.  One may call it eavesdropping but i was super impressed.   So impressed i wanted to whisper 'this food is terrible' and see if every wait staff turns around. (But i didnt ofcourse lol)   I also wanted to see if there were any microphones under the table.  Nope!  These gentlemen were the real deal with attention to detail and top notch service.  Thank you to all at Le Cirque for making our anniversary so special!  Coming back for sure!",

I've had better meals for 2 people with wine where the total was $200-$250.  Because of the exorbitant price, I had to drop this rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.  Service was excellent.  The only table with really good views of the Bellagio fountains are 4 tops.  The fois gras was good, but didn't blow my mind.  Langoustine was okay.  Wagyu was excellent, although it had to be sent back because it was initially overcooked.  Duck was unevenly cooked so some slices were perfect while others were tough.  Grand marnier souffle was the best souffle I've ever had.  So light and fluffy.  Appreciated the sugary crust on top.  The chocolate ball was cool, but the flavor of the chocolate was a bit odd to me...   All in all, I won't be back.  But if you have the dough to throw around, give it a try.",

I opted for the chocolate souffle and thought it was a lot heavier than before.   The wine was delicious! Dr. Loosen Riseling.   The only thing to call out was I didn't get a lap napkin. :( I do notice the size of the tasting menu gotten smaller.   The service was nice and served bread a few times. My favorite was the chocolate bread with cranberries! Delicious!  I loved the free gift, but wished they gave one for my bf as well.   All in all, I love this place.

Twist had a mushroom, artichoke and truffle dish which was about as good as food can get, but most of their dishes were disasters. Picasso's food was so bad I forgot it as soon as I took it's picture, but Le Cirque surprised me for coming through with a great dish every time. Le Cirque has been hit and miss in my previous trips here, but this time, no misses at all with the vegetarian menu. The service has always been the standard of what great service should be, but this time it exceeded its almost insurmountable standards.",

    "text": "I've never bothered to review Le Cirque before because, hey, it's Le Cirque.  OF COURSE it's five stars.  You need me to tell you that?  It's one of the finest restaurants in the world.  And, unlike some famous New York restaurants, the Las Vegas outpost of Le Cirque is not just a namesake.  It is simply fantastic.  I have recently found myself compelled to give less than stellar ratings to a couple of other Bellagio restaurants.  So, in the interest of fairness, I wanted to say something nice about a Bellagio dining experience.  Yelp defines five stars as \"Woohoo!  As good as gets!\"  Le Cirque is that.  If I had to quibble about something (and believe me, that's not easy here) I would mention that I might like a menu that is less \"bundled.\"  I'm not a big dessert fan, so I would be happy with a menu that allowed more of an a la carte selection, and didn't require me to order a multi-course meal with dessert.  But, you know, if I have to choke down a Creme Brulee or a  Souffle - well, as they say, c'es la vie.",

This is certainly an elegant place and everything from the decoration, to the service and the French servers, oh and the prices and meals are evidence to it.  Me and the missus aren't exactly fancy folk, so we felt a bit out of place once we were seated and were trying to figure out how the menu worked. But we asked Maurice and it was smooth sailing from there on out. I can see how some people that aren't used to this type of venue, much like myself, can be intimidated by it. Just ask, you won't be the first or the last. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Much to my surprise it was all pre-fix, so there was no way of leaving this place without spending at least$105 per person. Granted, this includes appetizer, entree and dessert, and the quality of the food and service is phenomenal.Once we got over the initial sticker shock (we should've done or homework) we had a great time. Each dish was better than the one before. Between the two of us we had the foie gras, risotto, rabbit, lamb, chocolate souffle, and chocolate ball. And everything was remarkable.",

    "text": "I had a tough decision on booking Le Cirque for dinner, a few hours before Le Reve at Wynn.  The restaurant has been around 18 years, virtually day one since Bellagio opened.  Very good Yelp reviews (though none among my Yelp friends), a Michelin Star, and top rankings from various local \"best Vegas restaurants\" lists and blogs.  The first red flag was my coworker buddy who ate here a week before who commented meh - French food that does not compare to Le Pigeon in Portland.  Nonetheless, I took the gamble and booked here anyways.  Overall I felt the dinner was good, but not excellent. I liked the small, intimate restaurant next to the Bellagio fountains, and the cute circus-themed art and colorful decorations.  Service was excellent along with the wine glasses suggested by our sommelier.  It was the execution of the 5-course tasting menu that was slightly uneven and the quality-to-price ratio that drove me to the 3-star rating overall.  The 5-course menu gives you more dishes, but portions seem smaller than going ala carte or many even the 3-course menu.  Plus they have several dishes with price supplements that can easily increase the price!  Excellent aspects: + The bread service.  Wow the coffee-chocolate bread sounds like dessert and is borderline sweet, but man did that taste good.  Next is the bacon roll!  + Australian Truffle Risotto.  Superb, creamy, and surprisingly not to rich.  Several generous pieces of shaved black truffle but expect to pay a whopping $40 supplement.  + Foie Gras of course, and it works so well with cherries and cherry amaretto sauce.  + Service from the waitstaff and sommelier were definitely friendly and Michelin-worthy.  Good aspects: + Potato stuffed sea bass was a small portion, so perhaps that is why it seemed slightly overcooked and you really need to eat it with the wine reduction.  Excellent leeks!  + Diver scallop was perfectly cooked and served in a shell with lobster bisque.  Its just one for a $19 supplement, so a bit pricey.  + Colorado lamb - Meaty and cooked well.  I liked the veggie sides and the sauce.    + Chilled Corn Soup - Interesting and colorful, and has some crunch from the buckwheat popcorn and some sweetness from vanilla snow.  + The raspberry parfait dessert was nice, with lychees and raspberries adding a nice surprise.  Mediocre aspects: + 3-oz A5 Wagyu Beef - At a $105 supplement we were hoping to be blown away, but sadly while some portions were indeed juicy and soft, the ends seemed drier and overcooked.  The A5 we had at Carmel's Aubergine (a 4 oz) literally melted in our mouth, while the Le Cirque version required some chewing.  Flavors were good, but the execution on texture didn't seem up to par.  + Panna Cotta - presentation was beautiful, and the custard was good.  Somehow biting into the pears in the dish gave me the feeling that they felt canned, but that may be just me.  Overall, I think Le Cirque is good, but for the price I think L'Atelier is a far better option.  With all the supplements, our 5-course tasting menu with 2 glasses wine, 1 coffee, and tax and tip came to about $600 for two.  The 10-course tasting menu at L'Atelier was less than that and there every course was awesome.",

Overall good food and good taste, but wasn't exactly what I expected from a fine dining experience.",

    "text": "What a fabulous restaurant! I've walked by this establishment who knows how many times. Luckily my bestie was in charge of the food and made restaurants before we got to Vegas. I would recommend that because it's an imitate place.   The location was great. The restaurant is located right on the lake. We were able to watch the fountains through dinner.   The restaurant is circus themed, just like the name. It's absolutely beautiful. I was a little afraid that my girlfriend and I had to be on our best behavior, however we were able to be our silly, crazy selves! Benjamin was our server, he was absolutely amazing! He was one of the highlights of our experience.   On to the food...WOW! Happy belly! I started off with the lobster and avocado salad. My girlfriend got the yellowtail hamachi. Our next course included the sea bass and the chicken. Dessert.... omg... dessert.... amazing!!! What didn't we have... I know I'm going to miss something. We had a raspberry sorbet with mochi, chocolate souffle, chocolate ball, and macaroons. Of course we had drinks as well. I had the la passion.   I love the pre fixe menu options. Letting the staff help you through the process really allowed us to have an absolutely amazing dinner. The experience was priceless.   Hands down recommend this restaurant.",

Small and comfortable with a wonderful bartender who has been here since this location first opened. In fact most of the staff have been here since day one. Dining here is an experience and I would have to say the staff is what distinguishes Le Cirque as a truly fine dining experiences. Always friendly and never a hint of an attitude. Extremely professional and they strive to make the occasion a memorable one. I even had to call this year to inquire about a bill question that I missed as we were leaving to catch a show. The hostess remembered me from the night before and answered my question to my satisfaction. There was no mistake but I just wanted to be sure the wagyu beef charge was correct. It was. I have entertained major clients here for years and each dinner has been a great experience.",

    "text": "Everything was exceptional from the service to the food. The service really put the cherry on top and I apologize but I never got that waiter's name. I'll just give him a quick shout out, he gel his hair up and he had blond/brown hair and possibly in his late 30s to 40? Idk this review is a bit overdue now so the memories aren't as fresh anymore but I had thought I had to give Le Cirque a 5 star review when I left the restaurant.   We all got the set meal(Prix-fixe menu for $105, I will simply go through what I got because they review will get too long if I write about my two friends got too haha) and although the price was a bit step hence the four $$$$ sign, I think it's definitely worth the money(possibly for special occasions like birthdays and such). I had their beef/steak tartare which was on par with Craftsteak's steak tartare and stand out possibly even a bit more simply because they give you fried beef tendon instead of crostini. Their fried beef tendon was exceptional(a bit too oily but it was the best tasting fried beef tendon I've had) and it worked so well with the steak tartare.   Among that amazing steak tartare, this is also a must and I'm not kidding. If this is your first time at Le Cirque, I recommend everybody to try their potato crusted Mediterranean Sea bass. From the sauce, to the potato crust, to their beautiful sea bass...everything was exquisite and unique. The potato crust was lightly crispy while having a juicy and perfectly cook sea bass. This potato crust is so different from any other place that I just have to recommend this to any first timer before you try anything else. I won't forget you...potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass :).   What stand out more is when you have a fix menu, I feel like I always get disappointed on the dessert. Le Cirque exceed expectations and gave me one of the best chocolate Souffle I've had. It wasn't only the best souffle or one of the best souffle I've had, but it was a big souffle that really puts you in the right spot after your appetizers and entree. The entree kinda leave you a little to be desire in terms of being full and this really hit the spot in terms of hitting the flavors and making you happy. There are no ways to describe this fluffy hot souffle that hit every level of excellence and that's all I'll say.   I'll give another shout out to the excellent waiter who also exceed all expectations just like the dinner had. The waiter makes jokes with us, took time to talk to us even though they're busy, let us see the recipe book(which they have at the restaurant), and gave us other desserts(but you'll probably be too full to eat after that wonderful souffle). I wish I had got your name but just know you did an excellent job just like the food had satisfied me in every way.   Hope to be back sooner than later Le Cirque, you were absolutely wonderful.",

I wanted to experience the satisfaction of watching delicious, warm chocolate being poured over a chocolate ball covering ice cream. We had dinner reservations at CUT at 10 and Le Cirque was closing at 11 so we knew there was no way we could have dessert after dinner. My boyfriend, who so kindly supports my food adventures, agreed to run around Vegas so I can get my dessert before dinner.   We got to Bellagio at 9:00 PM, ran to the restaurant and asked for a seat at the bar (highly recommended). The bartender (who's name I can't seem to remember) was a sweet, feisty woman with a lot of character. She was entertaining and welcoming and completely understood my visit to the restaurant for the chocolate ball (no judgement). She first gave us these little cold fruity dessert balls which explode in your mouth. Then I finally got to try my chocolate ball! And yes it was satisfying. She also gave us truffles in a keepsake box which was so sweet! I felt so excited! Like a little kid at Toys'R us (if you read this review years from now, Toys'R us was the store amazon ran out of business.   Needless to say, I want to go back for dinner on my next trip to Vegas.  :)",

Upon entering, you have a sense of traditional, upscale feel where everyone is nicely dressed and the white linen table cloths are laid out.  However, upon closer examination, you realize that the room is somewhat colorful and the fine china has subtle hints of circus decor.  The walls are colorful but not loud and have subtle pictures of the circus as well.  The ceilings and floor but high class but mirthful as well.   The staff are excellent and professional without any sense of condescension. The hostess greet you with a smile and the servers are fun and attentive.  They check on you frequently but not excessively.     Le Cirque's highlight is the high quality food that they serve.  There is a 3 course menu for $135 and a 5 course menu for $350 but frankly, the 3 course menu is more than enough to explore all the wonderful flavors this restaurant has to offer.  To start the Yellowtail was amazingly fresh and went down softly.  Flavors were strong but not too much to overwhelm the fish.  The Mediterranean Seabass was incredible, wrapped in a thin layer of potato and packed full of flavors.  Small yet filling.  Finally, the Strawberry Parfait was perfectly sweet without any annoying tinge of tartness.  An excellent dessert well worth a visit to the restaurant on it's own.    Le Cirque is one of the best restaurants on the Strip, if not all of Vegas.  Good service, eclectic but upscale environment and food that is exceptionally above most!",

Its a good place to have a quiet, intense conversation where the only thing you really want to remember from the meal is the conversation.  We came here as a party of 3 to try various dishes.  We all thought the meal was fairly forgettable outside of some pretty instagram pictures.  The presentation was 5 star. The taste was 3. The cost, we felt, was inflated by the yelp reviews and its michelin namesake from NYC.  If you're inside Bellagio, would recommend booking Michael Mina instead (which, though not french, has a ton of hudson valley foie gras).  If you're yearning for french food, try Bardot at the Aria.",

It is slow roasted for 2 days and it literally melts in your mouth. Every course had a spectacular presentation and there's wasn't one course that was a disappointment. Our sommelier was knowledgeable and fun. He taught us interesting facts about the wines we selected and was constantly checking in on us and our choices. This was a True first class experience.

But mostly I leave here more enamores because of the service that one receives when they come to Las Vegas Le Cirque. It must be mentioned that all or at least most of the waitstaff are originally foundational stuff meaning they been there for some 20 years. It is professional,  a career and carried out with such aplomb and such attention to detail  towards making the evening a delightfully pleasant one, though not pretentious by any means. Our servers that evening were Tom and Javier and course there are visits to the table by other dignitaries who offer amuse bouche and other delights courtesy of the chef along with your 3,5 or 10 course delight. I will not go into detail of the amazing libations and delightful morsels to experience here, suffice it to say it is a spectacle to behold. Tell them Daniella sends her love",

From a fresh and light Japanese yellowtail to beautiful vegetable/legume/edible flower combinations to crab with delicious Russian caviar to an impeccable foie gras and the list goes on! We chose to do wine pairing which we were very happy about as the wines were outstanding. This is where you come to dine if you appreciate fresh ingredients and incredible combinations creating dishes that deserve accolades. Their executive chef, Wilfried Bergerhausen, is easily at the same level, if not better, than the iron chefs. His creations are worthy of appreciative palates and foodies that appreciate the finest in exquisite gastronomy.  The restaurant is beautiful and inviting. The service is impeccable: attentive, friendly, and it is clear that they love being there.  It is on the expensive side yet well worth it for those that love the best in elite food. I will say that when speaking of the best restaurants, this restaurant is way better than a high end restaurant of an 'esteemed' chef at the MGM Grand hotel. It is more affordable and the food is way better and deserving of its awards.  This is a restaurant that is ideal for special occasions and just for amazing food! Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning. In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow.  I don't know how I had never been here.  It's been here since Bellagio opened.  I think it's my favorite French restaurant in Vegas.  And I really enjoyed it, and I don't love Frensh restaurants.  It's 5 star service, with 5 star food, overall just a 5 star experience!  It's tiny inside so make reservations and don't expect a huge interior.  All the tables are very close together.  ALBA WHITE TRUFFLE MENU: wow.  Incredible.  You can choose from 3 courses up to 8+ courses, and the price varies based on that.  My favorite was the Tagliatelle with truffles.  Simple and well done.  All of the courses are small but since they are all rich, 3 courses feels like plenty.  The quail was also incredible - super tender and rich.  The foie was a little much but hey why not.  The veal was very tender and tasty too.  The rabbit is their signature but honestly it was a little too heavy for me by the end.  I wish the rabbit dish was a little lighter but it was nonetheless tasty.    CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: incredible.  perfectly cooked. heavenly.  Maybe my favorite chocolate souffle I've had in a while.  And also I was so happy they had a chocolate souffle.  So many places are trying all these flavored souffles but really, it's a souffle.  Keep it classy Souffles!  Fresh juices: Ok, you probably don't come here to drink fresh juices but they make an incredible passion fruit and mango juice cocktail.  A piece of paradise in a french restaurant sitting in Vegas.  If you want something served to you that doesn't look like what you expect, try the tartare and beef tendon \"souffle\".  It will not be what you think.  It is one of the most interesting presentations of what someone nicknamed \"chips and dip\"...  Service is incredible.  Super friendly, with a dry French humor, and seems super authentic.  All our services spoke French I think.  Windows look out at the fountains and at Paris' Eiffel Tower.  They have their own bathrooms inside of the restaurant so you don't have to go into the casino!  People dress up but you don't have to if you didn't bring a suit or coat to Vegas, or if you just don't want to carry your coat after dinner...  The entrance is closer to the North Valet entrance, so if you're coming from somewhere else, get dropped off there and head in so you can avoid the crowd of the main entrance and having to walk all through the casino.",

    "text": "My wife and I had reservations at Le Cirque for 5pm last night so we could dine before the 7pm show at O.   This is a 5 star French dining experience. Jacket recommended but not required.   We arrived a few minutes before 5 and the door was still locked. Promptly at 5pm they opened the doors and we were seated at a nice table with a view of the famous Bellagio fountains. The restaurant is very small and intimate. Beautifully decorated.   We decided to have the special pre-show 3 course meal which proved to be plenty of food. I chose the escargot, the hanger steak, and the chocolate ball. My wife had the organic greens salad, the sea bass, and the chocolate ball. We also chose the wine pairing for an additional $40. So for roughly $115 a head we were all set. Not cheap but that is not why you go here. But actually that a quite a deal for what you get. There were several other menu options at a variety of price points up to $375 a head for a 10 course tasting.  I won't get into the details of every dish. All I need to say is that everything was presented beautifully, was extremely well prepared, and delicious. The hanger steak I will say was nothing amazing, but the burgundy sauce for it was, and the potato side was awesome.   The wine pairing was perfect. Frederic the sommelier personally delivered and described each wine pairing and he nailed each one.   This is a special occasion restaurant for most people, certainly myself included. For a pre-show dinner at Vegas, you won't be disappointed.",

Le Cirque at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino (1-Star Michelin) is an excellent dining experience at a fraction of the price of the 2- and 3-Star Michelin restaurants in Vegas. Enjoy!!",

    "text": "One of the worst dining experience we had.  We made a reservation a few months ago online to this restaurant, and my family were very excited about the experience. We arrived right on time (or probably 1 minute earlier), but it took at least 10 minutes for the crews to prepare a table for us. The attendance had to run back and forth several times to \"create\" a table. After 10 minutes, they found us a table and got us seated.   So at first we didn't feel like they were prepared for their customers.   What's worse? They gave us a table right at the location that all waiters would have to pass. We understood that the restaurant was fully booked so we were ok with it. The thing is, everyone who walked by us would hit our chairs. Literally, everyone.   We tried to move our entire table away from the walkway at least a foot, unfortunately our seats were still got bumped all night long, plus the person on the other side got a smaller space.   My parents still keep complaining about this experience after several days, that's a really bad experience for us.   The food themselves are just fine.   At the end of the meal, it's time to pay. Be careful with the tip they calculated -- it is calculated after tax, which means 18% is actually 24%, 20% is actually 28%, you get the idea. Unfortunately we didn't calculate, so we paid the tips after tax.   One more thing to mention -- they messed up the order of the main course. We had to pass the dishes to each other for the entire table.   As a Michelin standard, I don't think this restaurant's service deserve any stars.",

The primary reason why I docked 2 points was because I felt like the servers paid more attention to those who ordered wine or champagne. We had one server who enthusiastically explained some of the dishes but there were times where our table was unattended for long periods of time.  I had the hamachi for the first course and the dish was very bright, citrusy and fresh. The vegetables and the mandarin orange sauce provided the right fresh flavor and crispy textures to complement the fish.  Our group was served salmon with creme fraiche before the first meal, which looked better than it tasted. I couldnt taste anything special in the creme fraiche.   The seabass fried in potato was delicious. The seabass was consistently tender but the presentation was a bit lacking. At best the dish looked like an egg roll resting on pinot noir sauce. It wouldve been nice if the dish had some more elements because i felt something was missing.",

The rest of the night made us forget about this odd comment.   We went with the Daegustation menu. The food was incredible. It's not too often when we go to a restaurant and experience food that it so complex and intrinsic where we find new flavors and combinations that are mind-blowing.

    "text": "While this is the first time posting a review here, this was not the first time dining here.  This past weekend was able to enjoy a wonderful meal at Le Cirque.  Our normal approach is to go for the prix fixe menu but this time we decided to go with the truffle menu.  Wife choose 3 savory courses while I did 4.  The meal started with the amuse bouche which was smoked salmon topped with creme fraiche and caviar.  Excellent start, could really taste the smokiness of the salmon.  My first course was the sunchoke veloutte while the wife had the scrambled eggs.  Both complimented the truffles so well.  There was richness in each of the courses.  From here my wife then had the sunchoke soup while I had the tagliatelle.  The tagliatelle was one of the best past courses I have ever had that wasn't in Italy.  It was perfect cooked pasta with a nice sauce that paired pefectly with the truffles.  This will be a regular choice for me in the future as long as it is on the menu.  We then both had the quail stuffed with foie gras.  This course was good but I think we both went into this dish expecting on of the best things we ever will have eaten.  The quail was cooked pefectly, nice combination of flavors.  It was missing something to put it over the top.  Will say that it was plated with such care.  My final savory course was the rabbit symphony.  This was also amazing.  It was by far the largest sized dish on the truffle menu.  You get multiple pieces of the rabbit so you can see how the chef is able to master a delicate meat.  Not the first time I have gotten this dish nor the last.  Desserts were very good with lots of options.  Wife did a chocolate souffle while I went with the red velvet cake.    The truffle menu was really good.  All the dishes were in the very good to excellent range.  The amount of truffle you get with each dish is not all that generous so don't expect this to be completely covered with shavings.  That is not surprising given the price isn't that high for this option and it was alba while truffles which are the most expensive truffles in the world.",

Martin our server was so attentive and absolutely made our experience so memorable.  He was incredible.  The fact they only have one Michelin Star shocks me.  They definitely should have 3.  I can't recommend them more highly . Make reservations a few weeks in advance and you'll want to adhere to their dress code.  Their wine pairings and sommelier were spot on.  Vegas has many restaurants but do not miss this one. The best of the best.  Ask for Martin to be your server to make your evening  Perfect.",

Imagine my surprise when Misuzu appears mid-show of the performance of \"O\", with my wife's lost bracelet in hand !   My wife did not know it was lost. Armed with only my name on my credit card, she tracked us down to our seats during the performance.  The following evening we learned that she also had figured out that we were staying at the Delano and had tried to reach us there as well.  I wish she worked at the Mandalay Bay where I lost my eye glasses.  Misuzu is truly an amazing person and Le Cirque is very lucky to have found her.  She is a tribute to the professionalism,  integrity and values of the establishment, quite possibly the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  I hope to meet her again...I will be back.

There were no screaming kids nor really young people.   The three of us had the 5 course meal which came with a complimentary amuse bouche. That course started at $135/person. We also picked the scallop which I think was $19 more. Two of us also chose the 4 oz wagu beef for the entree which was an additional $35 per ounce. The beef was good but for me the 4 oz was just a bit too much richness that I had to share.   The bread options were wonderful - try the white chocolate bread! Between us, we also had the foie gras, the lamb, the gazpacho, snails, yellow tail, souffle, creme brulee, & ice cream. We had drinks and bottled water.   Overall, the service was great, we had a good meal, & it was an experience. I know that it won't be something I will do again unless I won lots of money at the casino as it ended up being a pricey dinner!",

The Maitre D presented us with one of the best table, overlooking the Bellagio fountain (and Paris across the street).

The place feels old school upscale though the staff don't make it feel stuffy. They are all very friendly and attentive. The sommelier was really good at chatting with the group and not being overbearing but still being really engaging. He was super generous with the pours and even gave extra when we were sharing some tastes.  We tried both the theater pre-fixe menu and the regular 3 course pre-fixe. The walnut bread is amazing -- couldn't get enough. For the theater menu, we got the steak tartare which had a tad more mustardy taste than I'd like but was beautifully presented and was delicious. The potato encrusted sea bass was phenomenal -- truly a unique experience that I'd highly recommend. The chocolate ball was also amazing presentation and filling. For the regular pre-fixe, the foie gras was excellent and a generous size. The bouillabaisse was elegant though only good (especially compared to the sea bass). The souffle was good but not great compared to the chocolate ball.   All in all I thought the theater pre-fixe was an amazing deal. I'd come back here again without any hesitation.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a very enjoyable Valentine's evening dinner.  We chose this place based on the reviews and the fact we hadn't dined at Bellagio in quite a while.  With so many great eats popping up everywhere on the strip, you almost take for granted such great resorts like this.  I made the reservation about a month beforehand and only had a choice of 5:45 or earlier or 8pm on.  8pm it was.  The really cool decor is what strikes you upon entering along with a single rose given to the wife.  It's classy and cool with some bright colors thrown in.  We didn't get to have a cocktail at the bar as we were seated within seconds of looking at the drink menu.    Service was impeccable and the 5 course dinner was unique and delicious.  The standout dishes included the Santa Barbara sea urchin with king crab.  My wife doesn't even like urchin and she finished it pretty quick.  Foie gras was awesome as expected.    I took a shot on the \"Ris de Veau\" which I had never had before.  It's essentially veal guts that may or may not have contained the throat, pancreas, heart, belly etc.  I think the majority of it was stomach.  It was interesting to say the least, almost tasted like high-end cow brain.  Glad I tried it but I would go with my wife's terrific beef dish if I could do it again.  I finished it like a good boy :)  The desserts were very cool.  I'd never seen anything like the chocolate cigar with passion fruit sorbet which came in it's own ashtray.  I posted a pic of it.  My wife went with the sugar sphere with yuzu and raspberry.  That came in a clear hardshell sugar ball filled with the fruit inside.  You simply had to tap the top of the ball for it to crack and enjoy.  They also brought out some extra bite sized sweets and presented my wife with some extra chocolates as we were leaving.    So why 4 stars?  I've had better dining experiences in Vegas.  Not just around town but at Bellagio itself.  I would rather do Picasso for the price.  And while the decor was nice, the tables were a bit cramped which didn't make Le Cirque as romantic as it could be.  You were able to listen to everyone else's conversations at all the tables nearby.  One couple two tables down kept going on and on about their kids and how they own 3 doughnut shops in Canada to some couple just trying to enjoy their own company.  Maybe it's just me.",

    "text": "This was one of the top dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional with two small nit picks. I found the service to be excellent.   I had a reservation for opening at 5:30.  I wanted to have a slow meal with time left over to get from the Bellagio to a show at the Venetian at 9 PM.  I was seated promptly.  I was immediately given menus and asked if I had a show or other time constraint.  Explaining my need to be at the Venetian by 8:30 to get my tickets, my server and I agreed I had lots of time for an unhurried meal.  (I should note for one of my Yelp friends--I was offered a darker napkin option from white as I was wearing dark pants.  I kept the white.)  They had four options.  There were two degustation menus--a regular one and a black truffle one.  They also have three course pre-theatre dinners and a la carte selections.  I ordered and iced tea which was quickly brought.  I looked at the truffle menu, but I had already decided on the regular degustation from looking at their online menu.  There were some changes to the menu.  I ordered and the delightful dining began.  Bread service consisted of several kinds of rolls.  I chose an onion and bacon roll.  I really appreciated the butter.  It was in two sections--one unsalted and one salted.  I am not a fan of unsalted butter.  The butter was shaped in the Le Cirque logo and was thin in depth so it became soft quickly which is another plus for me.  I hate fighting with near-frozen unsalted butter.  An amuse-blouche of a soup with a quail egg on top started the evening.  There were a couple of pieces of Iberico ham referred to as bacon truffle in the liquid.  It was very good.  There was a thin toast round on top of the glass and it was suggested I take the spoon and pierce though to the egg and goodness below.  I wish I had noted the soup on which the quail sat but I was more intent on getting a photo and then eating.  Course one was New Zealand langoustine topped with some osetra caviar and edible gold leaf.  The plate was adorned with some tapioca, passion fruit, and apple and vodka gelee.  I liked the langoustine, but the adornments were more for that than for a taste point of view.  It was beautiful plating and pleasing to the eye.    Course two was Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Royale with king crab and a lemon grass emulsion.  It was served in a white cup that would remind you of a sea animal.  Great plating idea and very tasty.  The sea urchin and crab were superb!  Course three was wild Atlantic turbot with roasted sunchokes, chanterelles, a celeriac puree, artichoke chips, and Barigoule sauce.  The fish was very good.  Course four was different from what I had planned.  The online menu has not been updated.  I was going to get their venison, but the menu had rotated and they hadn't changed the online version yet.  Instead, I got duck with a port wine reduction with a potato puff.  The duck was so moist and tasty and the duck jus was excellent!  The potato puff was so good I wanted to get another.  It was like you puffed a french fry after removing the potato from inside its out wrapping.  The reduction had solidified on the plate and was one point where I wondered why it was done.  A little nit pick.  Maybe it was a plating reason.  At this point, you have a choice of cheese or pre-dessert.  When I found out the pre-dessert was sorbet, I ordered the cheese.  It was a cows milk cheese from Switzerland served with some candied walnuts and two raisin bread rounds.  The cheese was delicately sculptured and the cheese course was very good.  The cheese was just a tiny bit on the way to sharp.  There were several desserts for the finishing touches.  I had ordered coconut souffle.  They also had chocolate and Grand Marnier souffles but he had me as soon as he said coconut.  With the souffle was a spoon of mango sorbet and a container of chopped mango and pineapple.  The spoon of sorbet was kept in place on the plate with some brown sugar so when you picked up the spoon to have some sorbet, you also got some sugar sweetness.  Very clever and tasty!  Accompanying the souffle, as if this wasn't enough dessert, were four mignardises--a lemon merengue tart, a raspberry tart, a caramel puff, and a dark, unsweetened chocolate goodness.  I felt guilty eating all these sweet things--well 2 seconds of guilt, that's all!  Service was impeccable except for my other nit pick.  As soon as you finished a course, a young man was there almost immediately to remove the plate so you didn't sit with a dirty dish.  The one time, he was almost too quick to remove the plate.  I was still eating a piece of bread when he removed the plate.  It wasn't to hurry me.  It was simply so you had a clean table in front of you.   He brought me a new glass of iced tea when my first one was almost empty.    I'm running out of review space.  This was a superb dining experience!",

I usually don't smell the \"greens\" of the vegetables but I did that day. The dessert was nicely executed, the chocolate ball melted as the waiter poured the hot chocolate in my plate.

    "text": "Michelin Star #40  Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good.   It's really not fair to Le Cirque that this was our dinner the night after a magical time at Guy Savoy (GS), but that's how the cookie crumbled.   The gaudy interior took me back to Joel Robuchon and made me long for the clean and modern space of GS:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#Pz6MCvMoqe20cjiEN61ICA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  We elected the full Degustation Menu and each got different things to maximize the number of dished to try. At $135pp plus $88 to share a wine pairing, Le Cirque really sticks it to you, which I'm fine with if the food is great.   In short, we were not impressed by much and some of the food was just bad. The service was stuffy, borderline arrogant at times, and without stealth. Pretty much the opposite of GS.   It wasn't all bad though, the poached egg with caviar ($15 extra) was very nice. The veggies were cooked right and the paprika crostini was a delight; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#HSFKfMYBwPd6Ti0H4rkfjA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  The uni and yuzu gelee panna cotta was also a very nice and refreshing treat.

I couldn't believe how sub-par this dish was; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#dVF_SYM3fhMsoCVWu4o9gA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  The potato wrapped bass was another let down, just lacking any seasoning and of course a place like this doesn't have salt and pepper on the table; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YRbileTLomHKFQSDkN4F_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  The $65 supplement for the A4 wagyu was a complete waste. The meat had little marbeling left and was pretty chewy throughout. This was nothing like the beef you'd get in Japan; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#9zwWrrYAV2cQ0ZMv7HHA2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  The duck was the worst offender of the night, with un-rendered fat, chewy skin, and meat so raw it couldn't be cut with their dull knives, we ate two pieces and left the rest; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#nL9yA-rNByjeeK6Z64c7Hg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  Dessert however was great, the souffle was amazing; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YnVOCWLwVeNzAsTT_p71KQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  And the sugar sphere thingy was beautiful and contained a delicious center; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#uTC99JJzT08_T21tppclug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a>  Overall it was a big letdown and not worth the effort to give a more detailed breakdown of each dish.",

    "text": "What an amazing treat for our 10 year anniversary. We opted for the 3-course prix fixe dinner.  Maurice and the staff were warm, friendly and funny.   We both ordered the Hamachi Yellowtail salad with mini radishes and mandarin oranges, hearts of palm curls, avocado puree in a ponzu fish sauce. It was just out of this world. I would have this dish everyday if I could! The fish was clean and sweet and the sauce was citrusy and fresh.   I had the lamb trio for the entree. There was a lamb chop, lamb meatball, and sweetbread (thymus gland). It was accompanied by mini spring veggies, golden raisin, and a mustard au jus sauce. The standout of the plate was the sweetbread, with its creamy flavor and dense texture, as well as the golden raisins, which packed a sweet and tart punch that reset my palate for the next bite of lamb.   My husband had the Dover Sole with the beurre blanc sauce and glazed string beans. The fish was breaded and fried and with the sauce literally painted on with some green veggies (which was later then doused on!!), with was a piece of art both visually and taste wise.   For dessert, I had the panna cotta with blood orange gelee and honeycomb. It was quite a large portion. It was light and refreshing, and the honeycomb was so fun and yummy. Where has honeycomb been all my life?!?   My husband had the chocolate ball. Upon serving, melted chocolate was poured over the chocolate ball to revel the malt center with hazelnut center and vanilla ice cream.  It tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher candy.   The wine pairing was perfect and we left with grand plans to come back at our next special occasion.  All the hype and great reviews are spot on. It's a magical dining experience.",

    "text": "This is the second time that I have been here (the first being at their signature NYC establishment), and I have to admit that this was an amazing experience compared to the first. Set against the back drop of the famous Bellagio water fountain, they managed to convert the circus decor into something rather elegant. That, for me, was an amazing achievement since I am still haunted by that crazy clown from Stephen King's book/movie IT. Admittedly though, the quarters were slightly cramped more than I had hoped, so much that I felt as if I was participating in the neighboring table's conversation. But at least everyone tries to speak in a slightly hushed tone. Furthermore, the restaurant claims that a tie and jacket are required. I have to be honest - the only people that were wearing the preferred attire were the waiters and me. Everyone else was in the jeans and a button up (maybe a few khakis).  Now, moving on to the more important affair of that evening, the food. I ordered the Prix Fixe plus the wine pairing. Although I cannot recall the menu course for course, I will tell you that the food was fantastic. The wines matched the food perfectly, and the food was well balanced and not too heavy. Since we had gone for an anniversary/birthday, they even wrote Happy Birthday and Anniversary on the dessert plates (except I think most any restaurant will do that). 2 hours later, I was happily drunk and plump. This definitely ranked high amongst my dining experiences and I think it's a great place to go for any special occasion.   Summary: 1) Slightly cramped quarters 2) Good service - not the best. We had a friendly waiter who was not a supercilious snob. But I have had weird yet great experiences where the help goes so far to open the bathroom doors for you. 3) French accents = Fake? 4) Fantastic food 5) Great view of the Bellagio fountain",

Two years ago, it had vanished so I dined on some fine turbot and wondrous vodka + granny smith atoms gelee though the gold plated langoustines they accompanied I had to send back because they were too fishy. They didn't mind, and didn't charge me. This trip, I was persuaded to try Le Cirque again and indeed their monkfish sounded intriguing. I've only had monkfish once before, at Le Bernardin  in 2010 and figured that was as high a standard as a dish could get. Le Cirque hit it out of the park. Better than Le Bernardin, considered by people who do such considerings, the best seafood restaurant in the world? Yes. They also gave me a liquid egg. I loathe liquid eggs. I love hard boiled eggs, omelets, quiches and other such concoctions but fried, poached or otherwise liquidized eggs are the enemy of my palate. But Le Cirque somehow made it palatable. Maybe the best service I have experienced, in a city full of great service. Wine pairing was serviceable, nothing of genius. Great food, wondrous service and serviceable booze- nobody bat's 1.000, even in Vegas.",

    "text": "The restaurant is non smoking, but it is right next to the Casino.  They don't close their doors until ~9 or so, and until then, it is NOT a non smoking experience.  Be warned.  Service was terrific and prompt.  Table next to us had a wedding proposal and a show to go to, and they accommodated all of those needs.  Atmosphere has a circus/happy monkey theme.   I liked it; some may not.  Some of the views oversee the fountains.  We had the tasting menu.   Overall, very good, not totally out of this world, but very good.  Some great stuff - Risotto with truffle, foie gras.  The cut of beef was  a little gristly.  The desserts (they brought one for each tasting) was terrific without being too experimental and the pre-dessert palate cleanser (raspberry sorbet with grapefruit?) was really terrific.  Petit fours that came with the check were high quality. They give truffles at the end, but in a little cardboard chest drawer - pretty neat.   I almost enjoyed the desserts the most.  Kind of expensive.  Just be sure the smoke isn't too strong for you before you go.  Michael Mina and Picasso (in the same hotel) are further away from the Casino and more smoke free.",

    "text": "For openers, perhaps one of the finest dining experience I have ever experienced.  Too often heavily starred restaurants have let me down.  Not because of any particular failure, but because the hype was just a little too much.  Stephanie Izzard's GNG comes to mind.  Being the flagship restaurant at the Bellagio, I did expect a \"wow factor\" but I have been let down on The Strip before.  Vegas teems with overachievers trying to do it bigger and better than the original.  Well, bigger and brighter is not always better.  Places like Daniel, Emeril, and Per Se cannot be improved upon.  Le Cirque did not try to dazzle, rather, it just succeeded in providing an elegant, warm, and earnest dining experience.  We all had the degustation menu.  My personal favorite was the sauteed foie over white chocolate and raisin brioche garnished with candied blackberries, asian pear & caramel (definitely a must for my \"death row\" meal).  My least favorite was the sea bass.  It was \"nice\" but a bit boring next to the rest of the menu.  I added escargot to the degustation menu and they were superb.  The deserts were fabulous and generous.  During our pre-desert, we encountered a strange deja-vu -- only to learn that the sweet rhubarb and ginger ice cream had been infused with strawberry Pop Rocks!  A nice whimsy touch to an otherwise serious menu.  I cannot wait to get back to Vegas and Le Cirque.  To date, my best meal in Vegas, bar none.",

The decor was charmingly romantic with soft pastel circus murals on the walls.  Even the whimsical dinnerware was unique and interesting.  And the food was simply wonderful.  Our meal began with a peanut soup which was followed by escargot that were tender and perfectly seasoned.  We selected breads , warm and flavorful,  from a tray brought to our table often.  Our entree of Sea Bass with potato crust was amazing.   I had a Grand Marnier souffle and my husband had the banana souffle.  The were puffy and light and tasted heavenly.   Every course was served with perfect timing so that there were no delays in the meal.  Finally we enjoyed a plate of small chocolates and were even given a tiny box with two truffles to take with us.  If you want a really special dinner try Le Cirque.",

We made reservations online and it was as easy as clicking some buttons, even for a long-weekend Saturday night (which we did, maybe a few weeks prior to our trip to Vegas). I believe there are two general seating times. Be sure to book the 6-6:30 pm reservation, if you have theatre plans afterwards. Oh, and most importantly, be sure to request for the fountain view. There are only three table against the French doors with max seating for four people per. On the day of our reservation, we accidentally walked into Circo. However, the sister restaurant was quick to point us in the right direction when the saw us walking in slightly overdressed for their venue. Le Cirque is tucked away next door... hehe. The hostess asked us if we needed to check in our coats or if we desired a cocktail in the bar before proceeding to dinner. We asked to have our cocktails at the dinner table, which was fine. During the course of the entire experience, the staff was very attentive. The FOOD... oh, the food. It was a SPLENDID tasting! Oh, and the wine pairing is a must have. (Who needs to pound their head trying to figure out what wine should go best with what's on the menu when the sommelier has done it for you?!)  They lavish their courses with truffles.  Perhaps, that was a low blow to get my vote, but it worked.",

The ambiance was nice as well, the dining room was small and well lit, and had the feeling of being in a circus tent. We enjoyed the whimsical artwork on the wall and even on the plates. The food also did not disappoint. From our amuse bouche to our desserts, all the items we tasted were delicious with amazing flavors. My favorite dish was my first course. It was a soup presented in what looked like a fish bowl and designed to mimic a forest in France. I didn't recognize this forest, but if the forest is anything like my soup tasted, it must have been a magic forest. So many flavors in each little spoonful. After our desserts we were presented with an assortment of sweets and my wife was given a small box of truffles. A great end to a delicious dinner!",

    "text": "We were pretty disappointed with what we were hoping was going to be a memorable dinner and ended up feeling like pretty poor value for the money.  Let me begin with the good: we each had a curious George cocktail, and it was the be best cocktail we ever had.  They yellowtail was also exquisite - fresh and buttery. The breads, the butter, the little details were all great.  Now for the bad: first, the degustation menu ($138 per person for 5 courses) does not allow for a couple to order a separate dish for each course without at least one person having to pay a \"supplement,\" which is anywhere from $40-$70 dollars.  For us, this meant that we had to order two of the same plates for two courses, but we ended up paying for one supplement, just to try something different.  This took a lot of the fun out of the menu, because it suddenly shot up to $200 for one person for one different small dish.  Second, the seared foie gras was simply worse than any foie gras I have ever had - it had a strong, musty smell, and was cold and curdled in the middle.  The main course (we were stuck with chicken because the other option besides the sea bass - which we had already ordered -- required a big $$ supplement), was really mediocre.  It was a lump of tepid chicken breast with gooey skin and gravy on top.  There was nothing spectacular about it, and it was so overdone that it could not compare to a good roast chicken salted early at a home kitchen.  The service was good, but the waiters would zoom by and say, \"\"how is everything, delicious?\" and when we would not answer, they would zoom away.  Not sure what they could have done, but the food just was not as good as it should have been for the amount of $$, nor was it particularly interesting.  $500 for this meal felt like a pretty serious rip off when compared to some of the other restaurants we enjoyed in Vegas for a quarter of the price.",

    "text": "Writing this review may be pointless, it may be silly to even bother (certainly feels that way), and it may get lost in the mix of the hundreds of reviews, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in anyway, despite the fact AAA has rated this restaurant as Five Diamond and I'm just another voice sounding off, ha!  This was my first time in such a highly regarded restaurant. Even though I've been to many fine restaurants, I definitely felt intimidated knowing this was Five Diamonds (you know, the highest rating from a respected institution short of the chefs having Michelin Stars!). What I learned? There was no reason to feel that way- the staff was so warm and accommodating, they made us feel right at home. I really appreciated the fact that they helped us make decisions and were really honest about everything. The waiter even offered to pay for our entrees if we felt disappointed in our choices! Surely he meant \"comp,\" but, regardless, it was nice to know I wouldn't suffer Buyer's Remorse on such an expensive dinner choice!   One thing I found remarkable, and perhaps this helps achieve their high rating, was that a member of our party requested a (fairly common) sparkling water which they did not have. The waiter actually had someone from the bar leave the restaurant and acquire some for her. Woh. That right there was mind-blowing to me.   Their wine list was particularly impressive, but asininely expensive. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars for modest bottles of wine. I'm fairly certain I even saw a bottle listed at around $30,000! I'm sure it was a Lafite Rothschild or something. The sommelier (read: a REAL sommelier) actually complimented my two choices! If that was genuine or not, I don't care. The words \"excellent choices, sir\" actually came out of his mouth. Brownie. Points. Mister.   Now to the food: everything was excellent. I mean, it was just...excellent! I don't even know what to say beyond that except that my dessert was a ball of ice cream in a spherical shell of chocolate topped with gold leaf (I ate gold!) and had a hot ganache poured over it, thus revealing the dairy insides.   The decor was so much fun, the restaurant is small and intimate, and if you get the table in the corner on the left when you first enter the dining room, you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from your table!  If you're willing to spend the money, you will not be disappointed in your experience her. It was True Vegas decadence and I loved every minute of it.",

    "text": "Le Cirque in the Bellagio has the formula for a perfect restaurant figured out -- gorgeous ambiance and Michelin-grade cuisine, coupled with a fun vibe and none of the stuffiness or pretentiousness that I typically associate with Vegas fine dining.  I was flying solo on a Friday night, so I dropped by Le Cirque since I had read on Yelp that it was very solo-diner-friendly.  Even though I had made a reservation just to be safe, I found it to be unnecessary since I was able to settle into the cozy bar and enjoy the full dinner service there.  It was also a good vantage point from which to enjoy the vintage-circus-themed murals and carnival tent decor.    The whole night, I was taken care of by the bartender, Gene.  He started me off with a \"deja vu\" cocktail (gin, St. Germain, cucumber puree), and a few slices of complementary (and dangerously addictive) walnut chocolate bread.  It was served in a stunning long-stemmed martini glass and tasted delicious.  Gene was friendly and chatty, and made me feel very comfortable and welcome as a solo diner.  I'm a believer in \"go big or go home\", so I opted for Le Cirque's multi-course degustation menu.   Although Le Cirque bills itself as French restaurant, the dishes feature flavors culled from all over the place.  Here's the list of what I tasted:  AMUSE BOUCHE -- minced cucumber with hibiscus foam.  COURSE #1 -- Scottish salmon gravlax with quail egg, pickled onion, baby radish, blini, lemon creme fraiche, and salmon caviar  COURSE #2 -- sauteed foie gras, kumquats, baby turnips, and pomegranate reduction  COURSE #3 -- potato-crusted Mediterranean sea bass with braised leeks and Pinot noir wine reduction  COURSE #4 -- espelette-crusted Colorado lamb chop with couscous, baby zucchini, turnips, tomato confit, and navarin  PRE-DESSERT -- tequila sorbet with grapefruit shaved ice and Pop Rocks  DESSERT --  chocolate ball with praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, and hazelnut caramel  PETIT FOURS -- an assortment of four small pastries  Every bite of this meal was perfection.  Picking out a favorite or best would be impossible.  I loved it all.  In terms of sheer visual appeal, the gravlax was a work of art on a plate.  In terms of indulgence, the foie gras wins hands down.  In terms of elevating a simple concept into something extraordinary, the winner would be the sea bass and leeks.  In terms of dinner-as-performance, the chocolate ball deserves kudos, since it's an incredible sight to behold to watch the a perfect chocolate sphere dissolve in front of your very eyes, revealing the ice cream inside.  An unexpected treat was receiving a small gilded box with two additional petit fours as a goodbye gift.  Another nice touch was receiving an email from the G.M. the next day thanking me for my patronage.  Just reminiscing about my evening at Le Cirque puts a smile on my face.  It was a 5-star experience in all possible ways.",

    "text": "My first thought is that I would never go back to this establishment given all of the choices in this price range, Picasso just downstairs is far superior.  We started with drinks at the bar, the bartender was friendly and we thought we were going to have a great evening.    The decor is fabulous and so much fun, too bad the wait staff seemed grumpy and put out to be there.  Our table was small and on a crowded wall, it felt more like a bistro table than a fine dining experience.  I don't know why they sat 3 couples in a row on this wall given that there were other open tables that were never filled while were dined.    We opted for the full tasting menu and the highlights were the amuse bouche and the cheese plate.  Nothing stood out and I was most disappointed by the signature sea bass, it was kind of dry.  While I don't expect to love everything on a tasting menu I expect at least one standout dish that blows my mind.  Not a single standout.  The service was terrible, don't know if we just got the B team or what but it was just off, here are some examples:  - waiters calling out to each other across the room - the servers standing at our table waiting to put down our dishes because no one came around with new silverware - a lovely fork with bent prongs  I've never had such cold service in my life and I do a lot of fine dining.  I'm sticking with Michael Mina and Picasso next time I'm at the Bellagio.",

Note that rib-eye arrives pre-sliced, which was a bit of a surprise and may have made it a bit less juicy than expected.  Nevertheless, wonderful.  We closed it out with two wonderful grand mariner souffles.  For the wine, we had a Nuits Saint Georges, suggested by the sommelier Frederic, who was wonderful as well.  Topping off the great service was the wonderful interior, which is really beautiful.",

It looks like, you know, a circus... tent and all!   The service was amazing.  Again, my first fine dining experience so I had never experienced having multiple waiters tend to our every needs. The food presentation was stellar and I especially liked the fact that each serving was brought by a single waiter who, while carefully placing it in front of us, would whisper in our ear a description of what we were about to enjoy.    Every bite was enjoyable and the desserts were just as good.  We ordered a bottle of wine and simply enjoyed a stellar meal.  My wife will tell you that one of the highlights was when they brought her a purse holder clip with \"Le Cirque\" written in rhinestones... of course her favorite part of the story is when they gifted it to her at the end of the meal.  She uses it everywhere we go now.  Can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "It's absolute craziness that this place has only 4 stars.  I have had fine dining all over the US and many of the great international dining destinations, and I must say that this is probably one of the top 10 meals I have ever had.  The wine list is rather good, especially if you are interested in library and iconic wines. It is focused a little more on the classically reputable producers, and the major regions, as I suppose that is what the clientele demands. There are some great gems there, and the sommelier is rather gracious in helping you seek them out. It is a little odd that they would serve Veuve by the glass... with such a refined cuisine, it might be more appropriate to serve a wine that is not mass produced to such a high level (but again, that might just be what the clientele demands).   The thing that impressed me the most about this place is how well thought out all of the dishes were. All of the flavors of each and every item that came out were perfectly balanced. It created a situation where the whole was truly greater than the sum of its parts. The sea bass was perfect.   the front end staff did such a phenomenal job.... their standard of service was one of the best I have ever encountered.   oh, and the souffle... my goodness. We had the chocolate and grand marnier.... both were great, but the grand marnier was phenomenal. Order the souffles when you first sit because they do run out. The table next to us tried to order towards the end of their meal, and they only had the strawberry souffle left to order (which was great, I'm sure, but still). It felt a little odd when our souffles came out as they were paying their bill haha.",

He asked if I was a guest at Bellagio (so he could bill my room, at a guess), I replied that I was staying at Caesar's. He then (jokingly I hope) said that if I left he'd have to chase after me and it wouldn't be a good look for either of us.  This is a \"jacket recommended\" kind of place, and I arrived in a 2-piece suit. At no point did I give the impression of not belonging, unlike the party next to me that arrived in Bermuda shirts and shorts. If the waiter was joking, it was in extremely poor taste. If not, even worse. Really soured what was otherwise an immaculate dining experience. From my observation, every single other member of the front of house was pristine and fantastic, which made his behavior all the more ridiculous.",

    "text": "I went to Le Cirque with insane expectations.  Being only my second dinner at the Bellagio, the previous one at the amazing Picasso, I had anticipated this dinner quite a bit.  In the end, I was disappointed.  We went in a party of 7.  When we sat down, menus were provided, but we knew immediately we were doing the tasting menu.  We raised some special needs with our waiter, and he provided several possible substitutions for certain dishes that did not fit the constraints.   He suggested a truffle rosotto over the scallop and mushroom.  Instead of john dory, how about rabbit, or chicken (really?), or filet?    With the menu decided, bread was served.  The bread was excellent.  There were three or four different breads in each basket.  The highlight was something I've never seen before: fat, soft pretzel bread.  It was like having a soft pretzel in bread form.  It was great.  The first course was a lobster salad, but I don't eat shellfish.  Instead, I was given a nicely presented traditional salad.  It was okay.  Nothing very exciting, though the tomatoes were excellent.  The second course was a sauteed foie gras with dried fruits and hazelnut.  A classic combination, again, tried but True. This was excellent, though I think I've had enough foie gras for a couple years from this one dish alone -- it was not lacking in quantity.    The next course was the risotto.  Again, the menu called for a scallop and mushroom, but I opted for a truffle risotto.  Boy, did it have truffles.  The entire mini sauce pan in which it was served was covered with large flakes of truffle.  I've never seen that much in one place.  The risotto was good.  The truffle tasted like nothing.  Yes, there was enough truffle to take many bites of just truffle.  I simply didn't understand it.  I suppose truffle is best appreciated through the nose. Other members of my party who ordered the scallop rosotto preferred theirs over the one with truffle.   The next dish was the jon dorry.  It was fine.  Interestingly, it was served with a red wine sauce, which I do need to give the chef props for.  That was unique to my experience.  Then, the lamb.  I am having a hard time remembering it, again.  The waiter did not ask for our temperature preference, and as such everyone's came our medium/medium well.  That alone was not so impressive.  I do recall that it was the cleanest frenching I've ever seen on a chop, though.  With all the courses over, our waiter asked us if we'd like dessert.  We say yes, order some coffees, and by the time the coffee is served, the waiters all come out with 7 different desserts prepared, one for each person (a surprise!).  We played a game of Pass the Dessert and got to try them all.  Each was quite large.  The best was probably a coconut/mango ice cream served in a coconut.  Other offerings included two souffles, a strawberry shortcake, and others.  On top, we were provided petit fours.  Again, nothing truly amazing.  In all, I found the food pretty generic.  It was solid, no doubt, but not creative.  Nothing elicited a \"wow\" except, perhaps, some of the portions.  I feel like the kitchen was playing it safe with this menu.  I must compare this restaurant to Picasso.  The experience pales in comparison.  Add on top of that that the menu is $145 per person ($40-$50 more than Picasso) and then another $14 per person for the truffle substitution (and for what, exactly?), and one wonders what the value proposition here is.    Perhaps my anticipation got the better of me, but in all, I can't fully recommend this restaurant.  I think there are better choices out there.",

    "text": "My foie gras was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  But long after I forget the taste, I will remember the path I took eating it.  You see, as the gentleman seated at the table next to us explains, the food at this restaurant is absolutely wonderful, but not the best in Vegas---you pay the  approx $110 per plate because of the presentation and the service.  Well said, my friend.    Our path begins wandering through the strip trying to find a place to eat that suits our mood.  Unaware that we found a world class restaurant, we stumble into Le Cirque and ask if we could be seated.  \"In the parlor\" she says with her pleasantly but assertive French accent.  I am tempted to fall for the accent, but my mom is French, and I naturally rebel to that sound.  No merci, I say, we will try something else.  Mon dieu! a table for two somehow opened in the main restaurant.  I am not offended. Rather a bit proud, as if I passed a test..why must the French always test??    The restaurant is aptly named.  The Bellagio fountains shooting off every now and then seen through the window are only background to the real show.  Under the tent is a hub-bub of activity with servers hustling here and there drawing laughs, suggesting wines, shaking hands, catering to whims..... You might suspect it to be noisy, but you are incorrect.  The decor is themed and consists pleasantly of soft orange and yellow and browns.     There must be a busy and jolly impressionist painting somewhere that is the inspiration.          Back to the foie gras.  You start with the first bite, it melts.  As you make you way through the dish, each bite exposes a new series of tasty gems---oils , raisins, cranberries, nuts and different oils.  The fresh finish is a small tumble of clover.    The wine, chosen by our server because we really have no idea how to choose from the hundred or so wines that range from $80 to several thousand dollars, smelled like roses. Oh no! we realize that we have not given ourselves enough time to fully enjoy this experience and make it to the 10:30 show.  \"Monsieur, I regret to inform you that I have some unpleasant news.. you see, we have tickets.\"  \"Oui, of course, I will make it work, I promise.\"  With a clap our new advocate chastises the nearest of the many staffers milling about---\"where is their food---they have been waiting...  Do not worry my friends,\"  Within minutes it is here.. my canard is in rich and flavorful medallions.  Not quite the foie gras, but excellent.   After two aperitifs each supplied, gratis, by you know who, the question of desert is our top issue.  One choice for something with chocolate and another for coconut.  She has made reference to the chocolate at least five times since we were there two days ago.  Mine was a fluffy creamy thing presented in a shell and provided a sweet surprise at the bottom.     We paid (ouch) and somehow made it to the show just as the music began!    I suggest that your path finds its way to Le Cirque. It is not only a restaurant but a journey.",

I couldn't have been more wrong.  The service staff (and there are a lot of staff) was so friendly and welcoming that from the first moment we walked in it was like we had always been customers.  They also let me order a starter from the vegetarian menu and then a meat from the regular menu.  English pea soup (warm) was fantastic and had a lot of depth, maybe from the addition of the mushrooms.  Then we had duck a l'orange.  I was afraid of something kind of \"sappy\" but the fat was perfectly rendered to the crispy skin while the meat was medium rare with a savory reduction underneath that was to die for.  Wow.  Followed by the highest, lightest souffle I've ever eaten (and I've had many).  The somm was very down-to-earth and didn't jump to the most expensive wine on the list, but instead steered us toward a wine that perfectly suited our taste.  This place will set you back some cash but it will be well worth the splurge.",

I was just too happy for anything at Le Cirque to annoy me, but in retrospect there were a couple of things. The waiters were extremely friendly, which was wonderful, but a little slow for a place of that caliber. For example, my wine glass stayed completely empty for about five minutes, until finally my boyfriend refilled it for me. Our server turned around at that moment and looked on in horror, then rushed to our table to see if there was anything else we needed.   The pate was okay, but not great. The rabbit was so salty I was chugging water. I guess the server noticed and came to ask me if everything was all right. I apologized profusely, then told him what the problem was. He also apologized, joking that \"the chef is from Alsace\" (which he is). He offered me something else off the menu, but it wouldn't have arrived on time so we skipped to dessert. My souffle came with a candle melted to the plate, which was a really nice touch. They have their own customized plates that are adorable. I forgot to ask whether they were available for purchase.  In all, the experience was wonderful, and even the mistakes the restaurant made were duly corrected. I loved the tastefully accomplished circus theme of the place. We were seated close enough to the window to be able to see the water show as well.  I don't think I will go there again (unless I happen to see 'O' a third time), but I would certainly recommend Le Cirque for a pre-show meal. I will be heading to New York soon, and hope to try their tasting menu over there.",

    "text": "Some friends wanted to try this restaurant and as an enthusiastic food adventurer we agreed to go along and see what all the fuss was about. There were 5 in out group and after a short wait we were seated.  To start with we were served an amuse-bouche of pureed peas with what looked to be a bit of mash mellow, this we all agreed was delightful. Next came the appetizer. I had the escargot and it was very good as well and I believe that everyone at the table enjoyed their choices as also. I have a weird restaurant theory that appetizers are usually the best things on the menu and my theory was mostly proven correct again. I think that the only person that really enjoyed their entree was my friend that ordered the the steak with the red wine reduction, this came at an additional cost of $ 45.00 which seemed like a lot considering that each of us paid $ 98.00 for our 3 course meals. I ordered the Black Cod and as a former fisherman in Canada and Alaska I know what great fish tastes like and this was not great fish!......my fault I guess, as I already know that fish should never be ordered unless you can see the ocean. My lovely girlfriend ordered the veal and it was not at all to our liking so consider yourself warned. Desert for the table was great for some and only OK for others. I had the creme brulee which was fine but certainly not outstanding. The wait staff was great! Our waiter was a tall thin gentleman who had the perfect combination of tact, attentiveness and a friendly attitude. He as well as the other staff were very nice and accommodating.  I would love to give this place a better rating but I just don't think we got our money's worth. Dinner for each of us ended up costing on average about $ 150 and that is a lot in my book......on the other hand it made me appreciate the great food that I get to enjoy at home ( Walla Walla WA) that cost significantly less and on most accounts is much better. I foolishly didn't look before hand on YELP to see how others had rated Le Cirque......you've been advised!",

I do not mind spending a lot of money on food if it is amazing. I and the rest of our party was disappointed. The food just was not amazing. Everything was good but it was not, as my friend put it memorable. I felt everything could use salt for one thing but this place is so uber fancy that I could not bring myself to ask for it. The restaurant is really pretty, the service was good but I still want my $500 back. It was a set menu for $145 per person for a 5 course meal. There were only two choices for each course and the second choice had an up charge of any were from $15 to $65 per course, Lame. When the food came out everything was eehh. The only thing that blew my mind was the dessert. The dessert was amazing! My husband paid $65 up charge for the kobe beef and when it came out it was literally the size of a gulf ball. I was joking saying \"were is the beef\"? I know this is a french restaurant and they are known for small portions but $100 for a piece of steak the size of a quarter? I will never go again. If you have money to burn this may be a good place for you. For me our bill was $500 per couple with no booze. The food was not amazing so it was not worth it.",

Try asking four times before it finally comes.  The food was very expensive and definitely not worth it.  The attitude from the staff appeared to be that you were putting them out.  This restaurant must survive on reputation (NY) and the place to be seen.  I was not impressed and encourage you to look elsewhere.",

Just like what I saw on tv, the restaurant was vibrantly and colorfully decorated and I was taking it all in.  We went for dinner at 7:30pm and advised the staff that we had a cirque du soleil show at 10:30pm. They told us delightedly that it will not be a problem, and that they have done the tasting menu for someone in 45 mins before!!  We were seated a little away from the window but still had the view out the window for the Fountain Show. All the wait staff were nice and efficient. We had the tasting menu.  Everything tasted as wonderful as they looked, from the oyster on half shell amuse bouche to the sauteed foie gras, to the seafood and the red meat courses. All the portion were appropriate.   They even had a surprise b-day trio dessert plated for me!!   Very yummie!! We were done with dinner by 9- 9:30pm.   Overall, I have no complains about the food at Le Cirque, they were all well cooked and great tasting. I guess the little minor detail was the service could be worked on, not that they weren't good but I didn't get the down to earth genuine feel...",

The food is very good, the bill was a solid $300 for 2 people.  I honestly have had better french food for about half the price at numerous places in the US, not to mention in Paris for probably 1/4 the price.    I'd honestly hit up Andre's or Bouchon before I did Le Cirque again.    (They drowned my maine lobster in cream and I couldn't even really taste it).",

    "text": "We came here for my birthday and had a wonderful time. The staff was friendly and helpful. I'm allergic to onions, which as you can imagine is a bit of a challenge when it comes to dining out in general, but especially for french cuisine. But they handled my request with grace and as a result, I had a fantastic dinner, albeit without a few sauces. But I didn't miss the sauces because the food was so well prepared. Oh, how I wish I could get their fresh bread selection. The white chocolate bread is unusual, but delicious. The bacon bread was... oh, how I want a loaf to take home. I could put tomatoes, lettuce and mayo and have delicious BLT. Anyway, back tot Le Cirque. The restaurant it pleasantly lit, not too bright, not too dark. The ambient sound is soothing and conducive to conversation. We enjoyed the five course Degustation menu, which had a bonus round at the beginning for soup, a tiny thimble full of... well, my husband had a corn chowder, but they served me a lovely beet soup to accommodate my no-onion diet. I also had the fall salad, foie gras (served with dragon heart plums, which I'd never heard of, but provided a wonderful tart counter to the buttery liver), scallops (perfectly prepared with a lobster foam), lamb chop. My husband had the sea bass which came encased in a pastry-like blanket of potato, and the chicken which was crispy and moist and well seasoned. One unusual touch was the pre-dessert, which was a sorbet with grapefruit and Pop Rocks. Yes, those fizzy candy things from your childhood. My dessert was the Creme brulee, while my husband had the Meyer lemon sorbet, which was a bit too tart. There were served with lovely micro pastries, including a tiny morsel of crust with a tiny pile of minced granny smith. I couldn't think of a lovelier meal.",

    "text": "Really, this place gets a lower rating because the service was awful.  Maybe it was that two of us ordered the degustation menu and two only an appetizer and entree but, when we hadn't gotten our entrees after 2 1/2 hours, we were less than happy.  When we told the waiter that we were full and wanted to leave and could you please box up the rest of the food, we waited another twenty minutes at which point he brought out our entrees.    I can't really fault the food.  Most of it was really delicious.  I really liked the duck that I got for my entree and would have really liked it later except the waiter threw it away and then tried to pretend that he didn't hear me say I wanted it boxed up.  To be fair, we spoke with the manager who comped an entire degustation meal but, even then, we spent $300.  I don't know if they were having an off night but the couple beside us and another table near us waited as long or longer and were also not very happy.  I'm pretty sure the large party near us also complained.  I might go back but probably only for the pre-theater menu.  It's too bad their service is so awful because the food is really good.  As a side note, the only thing I didn't like was the sea bass.  It had an odd flavor and seemed overcooked.",

I would definitely going for a date dinner, prices are a tad high but you get what you pay for.  The food was excellently prepared in that they don't serve your next course even though your not finished wit the previous course.  I don't think there are many a la carte entrees, so everything is either a 3 or 5 course meal.  The highlight of the meal was the dessert! Their desserts are really fancy in that they use ice bowls for ice desserts or the souffle's are really puffy until you break it open to add some ice cream.    Overall the dining experience is pretty amazing, and the portions aren't that small, I was left with a full stomach but a lighter wallet",
