It was just a regular sized hot dog... it tasted like store bought hot dog. The fries were ok... they were the skinny fries.  My boyfriend had the steak burger and he liked it, he also like their fries.  We went through the drive-thru and there was a long line but I think it's because they just opened a few weeks ago.  I don't know if I'll be returning but if I do I'll try one of their burgers instead.",

What WAS good though....the Vienna all beef hot dog on a butter toasted bun + fries! Sitting on a delicious Raising-Canes-like butter toast...The bread was so good and the hotdog full of flavor, that I didn't even put condiments on it! It's good enough completely plain jane!

It comes with lettuce, tomatoe, cheese, onions, and fry sauce by default which is nice n simple but if ur feeling adventurous Try the veggie burger with grilled onions, jalepeno cheese sauce, and fry sauce (or whatever condiments you want, they have a LOT to choose from). The fries r good but only fresh so i don't reccomend getting them to go..they will be cold and lifeless by the time u get them home. If ur a vegetarian or just love ice cream go go to freddys, u wont regret it.",

This wasn't a great first impression of their food after waiting about five minutes at the drive through window. Luckily, I planned on eating in the car and noticed before I got home. I headed back inside and approached the presumed manager (wearing a polo shirt), and he was friendly and apologetic.  Once he bunned me, I went back to the car and tried my double steakburger, California style. California style comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, raw sliced onions, and the typical thousand island-style special sauce. The burger is smashed and crispy, Steak 'n Shake style. It was tasty, but I felt it was a little small for the $4.69 price.  Despite the bad first impression, I will probably give Freddy's another try. The chili cheese fries are calling me...",

I love the nice thin burgers- and I love the flavor they have. If you are someone who likes more meat- then add a patty.  I actually cannot believe someone said they had a better burger at Jack in the Box- gross! I love that my burger actually tastes like beef. One thing that does suck- they close at 10 on a weekday.

But their main thing is still their burgers.  The Freddy's Original double with cheese is pretty good.  They do thin and bigger patties.  The flavor is standard and not too oily, nothing special in my opinion but a solid burger.  The fries are the thin type, which I like and they have fry seasoning you can add after too which is nice.  The new Philly cheesesteak is a bit dry for my taste and could use a bit more meat.  The cheese sauce on top is pretty good and helps make the sandwich.    The turtle custard is yummy, a nice way to top off the meal!",

The atmosphere reminded me of an In-N-Out with a mix of Five Guys service and a Steak N' Steak diner feel. Anyways, my boyfriend and I shared the #6 combo- double cheeseburger California style combo with the Chicago style hot dog. The burger had a piece of hair on my bf's hamburger patty! The meat tasted plain and dry. The fries were shoe string fries but had too much salt!!! The Chicago style hot dog was wrapped in a butter toasted bread with an all beef frank, peppers, onions, and some celery salt. The hot dog was overpriced for a small piece of meat, same size as your typical grocery store hot dog. If you take a bite of the hot dog itself, it is very salty...Overall, while the concept they were trying to create was cool, the food itself needs to work out some major kinks. Try this place out and you might get a different experience then we did!",

The burger tasted exactly like Steak n'Shake- which is not a problem, I love that place. If you are looking for a thick burger, this is not the place. These are thin steak burgers so maybe get a double. All in all, very clean and good customer service.",

I ordered the #6 California burger meal. It's a double cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The burger was very tasty and to me very similar to in n' out. My wife mentioned that this place reminded her of steak and shake. Same vibe and the food taste similar. There fries weren't bad and you get a huge amount per meal. Good size drinks but stay away from the brewed ice teas. I couldn't taste the tea, it was just water really. This will be another one of our go to places. They also have a drive thru which is a big plus. I almost forgot to mention that most of the staff is very friendly.",

The paddy's are thin, so if you are hungry I would start with a double at least.  The fries were well-seasoned and the onion rings were crispy.  The prices are very reasonable and you will definitely leave satisfied with the main course.  And then...  there is the frozen custard.  Be advised that your eyes will be bigger than your stomach here.  The small is probably plenty for most and too much for others.  The selection is great as well.  So far, I've had the Turtle and the PBB&C sundae, both were delicious and are highly recommended.  This is probably my favorite burger place in town and is a must try.",

Since I thought double would be too much I requested it be made a single. (Because no single patty burgers were options on the menu.) the patty had a great grilled burger taste and not greasy. BUT their patties are super thin and flat...hence why everything on the menu is advertised as DOUBLE. Which had I known I would not have requested for a single pattie burger. I know now... double burgers are not big!! Also they have show string fries which were tasty, but al the ones we got were tiny fry bits. Possibly because it was in the evening and those were the dry leftovers? To say those came up a little short, literally, the overall quality and food was good!",

So far I've only had the Patty Melt (no onions) and it is really good. The sign is a little misleading. It kind mashes you think you are getting a double burger, but the steak burger patties are quite thin. Still very flavorful and it ended up being enough for me, but I'll need to double up if ever ordering for the bf.   The girl St the drive thru was great. She informed me of what came on the burger, basically allowing. We to customize (remove onions, please) I ordered a combo with chili cheese fries because why not? And she also reminded me that they came with onions. This place lives their onions!   Small issue, when I received my order the chili cheese fries still had the onions on them... Luckily I was planning to devour them on the Way home, so I was able to easily go back through drive thru. The girl was very good about making me a brand new order. She insisted that I keep the other order. All and all pretty good meal/experience... I'll definitely be back for some of that drive thru tea!",

After going to the Victorville, CA location...and then finding out that this one is owned by the same person, I had really high expectations, that were not met.  The good: The staff is SUPER polite, and very helpful:  welcoming us when we walked in, wishing us a good day when we left, etc.  The fries were FRESH, and hot, and delicious.    The not so great:  Comparing to our visit last weekend to the Victorville location, the burgers were REALLY underseasoned.  They weren't bad, but it was definitely noticeable.    They messed up my fella's order...a lot. He ordered the original double steakburger, adding ketchup, lettuce, and tomato.   He got a single steakburger, California style, including thousand island...and he hates mayo based sauces.   He wasn't thrilled with it initially, noticing that it was a lot smaller than it should have been, but about halfway through the burger, noticed the thousand island, pulled the burger apart and saw why it was so small...  Now, we didn't send it back...mostly because he was already halfway through it, but he was super disappointed.    I'll attribute this to maybe being an off day, and would still gladly go back...but I don't know that I'd drive out of my way to eat there.",

Both were very tasty and well seasoned, but  the patties could be a little thicker.   I love their skinny mini fries. they were all perfectly cooked and a generous portion too. Give the Chili-Cheese Fries extra love by hitting them with some Cholula action...The staff and service is great here, and another cool thing is you can order dessert with your meal and put it on hold. When you're ready for dessert, go up and hand a cashier your receipt, or one of the staff will be nice enough to get it for you after bussing your table.  We shared the Turtle and PBC & B(Peanut Butter Cup and Banana) Sundaes. They were good, and the consistency of the custard was smooth and creamy.

    "text": "Yum! Ok, this burger hit the spot, and well worth the drive.   Decided to drive to this location because of the many awesome reviews, even though the one in Henderson is much closer.  Walked in, and it was SO BUSY! Of course, we chose to go on a Saturday around 1pm. I could barely hear the cashier, it was so loud. We had already decided on a double cheeseburger for my husband (thanks to all of the previous reviews talking about how thin the patties are), and a single for me. The cheeseburger comes with onion, pickles, and mustard. I just asked for ketchup and mustard on mine. For the double, we got a meal. For $.50 more, we changed the fries to onion rings.   So glad we did that. The onion rings were some of the best we've had in ages. The burgers were really good. They had that nice flat grilled, juicy taste. Their pickles are sliced lengthwise. Love that! The single was perfect sized for me, as I didn't feel ridiculously full after I finished it. The double was similar to a decently sized regular burger elsewhere.   I didn't care for their fry sauce, as it was kind of tangy. I like that they had both ketchup and mustard dispensers by the soda machine. This place was very clean, and all of the dispensers were full. Nice staff.   We were very pleased with this place, and were surprised that we have not really heard more about this place. We are for sure coming back, and we also need to check out their custard. I fell in love with frozen custard while living in the Midwest, and am looking forward to finding a place as good as Kopp's.",

The dining area is pretty spacious,airy,open ceilings. There is also a drive thru, didnt see any cars go thru during my visit. So FYI there is drive-thru service Yelpers. BTW the address is listed wrong..should be 9809 (see my photo)   Service - Hard workers!!! Minute you walk into the place you are greeted by smiling faces eager to help you. In fact one of the employees saw us walking up from the parking lot and opened the door and greeted us. For being so new it was nice to see staff was confident when giving descriptions of their menu items. You place, pay and pick up your order at the counter when your number is called. Our wait time was less than 3 minutes.  Tables were cleaned up pretty quick.  Eagle eyed workers also came around and continuely cleared our table as soon as dirty napkin,empty straw wrapper hit the table...no kidding!   Food -  Ordered their Orig Freddy's Dbl Steakburger which was their plain burger just pickles are on it..cheese was xtra.   If you want the lettuce, tomatoes whole bit upgrade to the Cali Burger . We also got Chili Cheese fries  to share and the Mr. got the Triple burger + a hot dog combo.  Our order came to $20 for all  food and drinks!   Everything was cooked to order,  so food was still hot when we sat down to eat.  The burger patties are pretty lean, no greasy oozing out mess here. They are smashed thin so the texture of the edges were pretty  brown & crisp on the outer part and cooked well done inside.  They're evenly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic.(that's what my tastes buds detected)  The bun was buttered and toasted. If you're a big eater the portions might be small for you, but it was perfect for me, it satisfied my red meat craving and  I didnt feel guilty \"super sizing\" it to a double burger.  The fries were the shoestring variety, still hot and still crisp with all the chili and velveta like cheese poured on it.  Their chili is a tad salty for my taste.  Mr. B said the hot dog was okay, I thought the buttered Texas toast was a different and cool take for a hot dog bun.    The custard I ordered was a Vanilla concrete, similar to DQBlizzard. I dont get why it's called a \"concrete\" though, I was thinking it was going to be served up as brick..lol  The custard concrete is like a real thick ice cream but more dense, creamier..and felt very  rich & fattening ..the mixin I chose was caramel.  The custard was good but I only had a few spoonfuls since I was stuffed as it was.(so note.. order it to go next time) .    Overall we enjoyed our meal, food was good, service great! I will probably choose this place over 5G's for my go to fast food burger joint when in the area because the prices are more reasonable and Freddy's got the custard!!",

When your team member can't hear what your customer is ordering through the drive thru, please don't tell them to say,\"you need to speak up!\" That to me comes off really rude and disruptive, especially when they're shouting back at you.  I'd prefer a more calmer and pleasant approach like, \"I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Can you please repeat that?\" And maybe we'll raise our voice just a little so you can hear us better. If your intercom can not pick up normal talking decibels, then maybe that is what need improvements.",

I'm usually hard on drive through because usual drive through employees are lousy and  a bit prude, but NOT FREDDYS.  Fast and 100% customer service even through drive through.  EXPERIENCE:  Drove up and was greeted right away with a friendly and welcoming voice.  I told the girl that it's my first time and I asked her which was better, the number 1 or number 7? She told me number 6 with bacon. She did not hesitate to tell me what and enjoyed and to be honest I'm glad she told the truth!   I also ordered a mini chocolate milk shake and OH MY GOSH, best Chocolate shake I ever had!!!  Got my order quick and they greeted me goodbye! Definitely coming back!  THEIR STEAKBURGERS ARE THE BEST AND THEIR FOOD IS NOT OILY AT ALL.  No regrets. I'll be back for great service!",

I think Freddy's is better (but shhh I secretly don't want to admit it). I don't know why people compare In-N-Out to the likes of shake shack, five guys, etc. I think those are unfair comparisons because In-N-Out is much cheaper than those places. However, I truly believe that Freddy's is the best direct comparison because of the price point of the burgers and the staff is just as friendly.  As for food, I usually get the California style single steakburger with grilled onions and fries or upgrade to onion rings for a little bit more. The burger is as good as in-n-out or better, but the fries are hands down better! The onion rings are really good too (and that's not something In-N-Out has)!  Also, if you have room or want to share dessert with someone, the concretes are also delicious!",

The burgers are small, kinda smashed thin and a little greasy.  All of which I like.  They remind me of an old school burger at the frosty I would get as a kid.  They are similar to Steak n Shake and In n Out.  The custard is good too, tons of flavors/options to customize your concrete or sundae.  I don't crave burgers often but when I do it is usually Freddy's.",

There are several large groups with sporting uniforms, the place is a buzz with noisy chatter.  They finally call our number and the burgers arrive.  The bun is fresh, butter roasted on the flat top, the burger moist and has great flavor, they call them steak burgers and they are cooked when ordered.   The skinny french fries are golden brown and crispy.  Overall, a good burger meal.    Once finished, we decided on the custard.  I got a chocolate brownie delight.  The brownie was a bit hard and at the bottom of the cup.  The custard, whip cream and nuts on top made it difficult to get a bite of brownie, but I managed.",

If you ever feel like torturing someone ... let them have a little taste and then eat the rest in front of them. Gitmo tactics wouldn't hold a candle to that.

Graciously a Korean War veteran purchased our lunch for us. As a service member myself I'm so grateful. Later during our meal another Marine Corp veteran paid us for our service and our meals. The Freddy's clientele is always amazing and never lacks the welcoming feeling. I'll be back for my Oreo cookie sundae!",

    "text": "First time at Freddy's, not sure if I'll return mainly because of price point.  Went through drive-thru, and you know what they say about drive-thru.  Oops.  They almost got it right - just the California burger was opposite of what we ordered (everything, no onion).  Darn!  They read the order back correctly too, so I had such high hopes.  The patty melt was good, and I enjoyed the super skinny fries.  Ice tea seemed fresh as well.  Kids ordered a mini sundae and concrete.  My husband kept announcing the price with surprise each time we added another item - it really was quite funny.  In the end, after three hamburger meals, a chicken tender meal (regular), and two mini desserts we spent $43.  I guess that's a bit higher than most other fast food joints.  What surprised me was the price of the mini desserts ($3.50 each) - guess I don't get out much.  All in all, not bad but not great.  Have to say I do like being able to get a patty melt in the drive-thru.  Ok, maybe I'll go back for another patty melt someday.",

Spoke to one of the owners last night (Curtis) what a great guy. Also Asha, the gal at the register who helped us pick out some new items to try (yummy - chili cheese fries), so warm and friendly. Great job Curtis and Asha. Thanks to you two (and other great staff there as well) We will keep coming back and recommending this place to all we know!!!!!!!!",

Truth be told, I overate tonight. I wanted to stop midway through my meal, but it was too damned good.  I love all kinds of burgers! Sliders, turkey burgers, green chile burgers, and of course steak burgers. Freddy's has perfected the steak burger-sorry Steak n' Shake. I chose the Double Steakburger (California Style), which consisted of 2 patties,cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a thousand island sauce on a soft delicious bun ($7.29 for the combo). Wow! The burger was so juicy and tasty on it's own, I didn't even need anything else to go with it.   However, the burger came with a pile of shoestring french fries that were seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.I never eat all of my fries as I usually save my room for the burger and soft drink. Until now! I put those things down and took it as personal challenge to finish every last one.   Then, my wife had to mention dessert. Hah? No way! Oh, OK! Did someone say PBC & B sundae? Vanilla custard , Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, banana, whipped cream & cherry-sounds good right? My wife and I split the mini sundae ($3.59), and it was plenty. But then again, I was full long before the sundae arrived.",

I had their cheese burger which was good, but not anything special necessarily. Reminded me of In-n-out because they also have their own sauce. If someone I'm with wants to eat there I'd have no problem with that, but I don't think I'll necessarily go back just for myself.  Something to note if you do go: they have a horrible line area.  We got lucky and seemed to go during a lull, but about 3 minutes after we got there the line got incredibly long and it was uncomfortable because people didn't know where to stand, it was kind of funny.  Also, there are WAAAYYY too many workers walking around and standing idly.  It made it super awkward when my family and I were trying to eat and every few minutes someone asked us how our meal is..not gonna lie but in 3 minutes nothing is going to change from our answer haha And at that point we were kind of wondering if they're going to have that many workers why don't they bring us our food instead of calling numbers and we go up and get it? Just a thought.",

Unfortunately the last time I visited her, we had so many other places to try and never got to Freddy's. I mean, when faced with the choice of a puffy taco in TX or a burger in TX, the taco will win every time.   So I brought my family here a few months ago and we all enjoyed our food immensely. As my poetic husband wrote in his review (Ray L.), it was \"fat pants\" worthy. The meat in the burger is not like the other places around here. It just screams \"Hey! someone made me on a real flat top grill and I'm hella good!\". With the yumminess of the burger, the deliciousness of the fries, what else can a girl ask for? Dessert...Oh Yeah!  I get the PBC&B every time. I want to try the brownie sundae but can't get myself to switch. My fam and I always leave this place feeling overstuffed and super satisfied. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh, and prices a right.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to take a big bite of heaven disguised as a burger.",

Smashburger's burgers and fries are better than Freddy's, and they have a better menu selection (chicken as well as vegetarian options).

I was skeptical at first being the hard core Chicagoan I am.( hot dogs are a big deal to me!) that skepticism melted away with the yummy toasty goodness that accompanied that first bite. They've made a mistake or 2 in the drive thru so always double check. Even with the mistakes they're very good at making sure customers leave happy.  I recently tried their hatch chili burger and it doesn't disappoint on flavor. They dice the chili peppers and mix them with grilled onions so it's an even distribution unlike Carl's Jr.'s whole seeded pepper.",

In between ditching classes and playing Halo: Combat Evolved on our super rad LAN parties in the dorm rooms, we would eat (because most humans require food to operate and we required food to operate our Xbox controllers.) The choices in the small town weren't plentiful, we had the choice of the student union, chick-fil-a, Wendy's or a little place called Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers. You see, chicken sandwiches and square patties got old after a thousand times, but something about Freddy's steak burgers and their thin patties hit the spot in a way the other chains couldn't. I'd like to say that many a study sessions were fueled by these delicious burgers, but I didn't study, studying is for nerds.   Long story short, Freddy's on Eastern is everything I remember from college and is a welcome addition to the Vegas fast food scene.",

    "text": "This location seems to have taken a dive downhill. It's still a-ok, but it's sloppier and less good.   The best part is the concretes. You now have to specifically ask for whip cream and only the first topping is free. And on my last trip, they didn't even mix it up. There was a bunch of heath toffee at the bottom with a bunch of vanilla custard sitting on top of it. Poor form. But at least they do have a slew of toppings and mix-ins to choose from. And the custard is tasty.  The Chicago hot dog is fine. It tastes like a hot dog. Nothing special. But it's a safe bet.  The fries are shoestring fries, which are enjoyable. They are usually always cooked just right too.  The burgers are ok. Kinda meh. I ordered a double California. The toppings were of poor quality. Wilting lettuce. Can pickles go bad? I think these were bad. Why is the tomato and onion so icky? Something went wrong here. And the California burger was supposed to include 1000 island dressing. There was absolutely none on the burger. There were, though, two sauce cups of some sort of bleh ketchup and mayo combo. So was that the 1000 island dressing? Or was it fry sauce? Was it both? Either way, it was a rip off.  So, in sum, the concretes are usually worth it (perhaps you now need to request they mix-in the mix-in?). But the non-dessert items aren't really worth it. And it's way overpriced. I spent $15 on a combo meal (burger, fries, and small drink) and small concrete. Not worth it.",

They are perfect.  Next the burgers is fresh nicely crispey edges. I am Amazed at the flavor and the freshness. Everything about this burger was AMAZING!!

We shared a concrete but have decided to never share again. We each want our own!  After talking to many friends and neighbors, we have found that most people agree about this. Steak burgers aren't that great but custard and milkshakes are fantastic.",

And when I tried to bring this to their attention the woman just molested my burger saying there's lettuce underneath. Obviously but I asked for extra and was charged and you didn't put 'extra' on there. This has been an on going battle with them. While I've liked their food I'm kind of over this place and the comprehension of what extra lettuce is when being charged. The last straw was the woman molesting my burger. I was out done then.

I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!",

    "text": "Im glad I didnt have high expectations based on the 4 star average rating. I ordered the Double California Steak Burger Combo. It came with shoestring fries and a drink. The burger itself was not as big as I thought since there were two patties. It's about the same size as an In n Out Double Double, only In n Out's has a little more veggies. The patties themselves were a bit salty and just a tad overcooked. The fries were your average shoe string. The Freddy's sauce and special seasoning is what probably allowed me to finish the fries.  What is making me give them 3 stars instead of 2 is the dessert they are known for! Frozen Custard! From their menu you can have it either as a Sundae or Concrete (milkshake form). I ordered the PBC n B Sundae. Comes in mini, medium, or large. Im glad I got the mini cuz I could not finish it! The PBC n B consists of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Sliced Bananas, Frozen Vanilla Custard, Whipped Cream, and a single Cherry on top. (refer to my pic!) They have other tantalizing flavors as well which is probably the only saving grace in coming back here.  Service is friendly as evidenced by the smiles and attention I received at the counter. Prices average about 7 to 8 bucks if you want a decent meal to fill you up. The overall size of the place is very spacious with enough tables and booths. The bathrooms are a nice size and is actually pretty clean.  Overall, its an ok burger place. For you peeps with a sweet tooth, the desserts will always hit the spot here. If anything, make this place as your go to dessert place after having dinner somewhere else.",

Was I imagining my whole Freddy's experience?  Anyways I am a fan of their good.  It seems like more of these amazing burger spots are coming here.   Their burgers were mighty tasty.  You can order singles, doubles, and triples.  As originals (pickles, onion, cheese and mustard), in California style (onion, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and thousand island sauce), or however which way you wanted it.  Just expect it to be a little messy when you eat it.  I've had the Double Steakburger California style and the Original Double Patty Melt both very very delicious.  Not a fan of shoestring fries but they were well made.  It should be more of a topping added to the burger and piled with fry sauce that's at least how I do it.  It gets incredibly packed during lunch, good luck finding a seat.  A bunch of us from work came here and we ended up seating at random table that freed up.  We probably sat at 4 different tables scattered throughout the dining area.  There are a lot of seats but it just gets busy.  They do have a drive thru. I don't like their booths they are long and can fit a bunch of people but everyone has to get out for if the person closest to the wall needs to get out.  Because it gets busy during lunch, this one time they must have mopped but didn't place those caution signs and I slipped but didn't fall.  I was holding the food tray and my food was sliding freely on my tray.  Try balancing your food on a tray while not falling on but sliding all over the place on a slippery surface.  Would've been one hell of a mess.  I still have to go back for their custards and milkshakes but it is getting warmer so maybe tomorrow.",

The reason why I came here is because they have a sign that says shakes, malts and floats. Cashier tells me they don't have coke but they got Pepsi...ok...so can I have a Pepsi float then? Geez! They should change the sign to just root beer float then. And when I received my regular size coke float that cost $4.59 it was such a rip off! Cup was only filled half way.

On the first trip I had the double California and it was very good, my wife had a single steak-burger. The patty, although slightly thin,  has some nice char which we both really enjoyed. My son had a hot dog and he said it was better than Nathans. He gave it 5 stars.The bun is loaf style, buttered and toasted. The thin-cut fries were excellent, and we used the special sauce for dipping which was far better than the usual ketchup. The meal ended with a shared Turtle Sundae which was first-rate and very tasty.  The second trip called for a Patty Melt, it was delicious. The onions were perfectly grilled and tasty, the bread toasted and buttered. A nice meat to bread ratio. I added some of the Freddy Sauce and it made the sandwich even better. The meal ended again with a Turtle sundae.  The price is reasonable along with an ample menu selection to warrant future return visits. I would not say that Freddy;s is better than Two Guys, Smashburger, In-n-out, they are all on the burger radar, but Freddy's offers a great alternative and excellent custard creations for dessert.The dining room is large and has a welcome ambiance, the self-serve drink station, Freddy's Sauce & Ketchup dispenser are a welcome change to tearing open 10-15 small packets plus the amenities are well-done. The staff is helpful and friendly plus eager to answer any questions.  The only reason to go to Micky D's is if you only have a dollar in your pocket.",

Let me start out by saying that I DO NOT LIKE SNS AT ALL. So I would never compare Freddy's to them. Would you compare a watermelon to a grape?   No. In short we LOVED Freddy's! Service? Fantastic. Speed of service? Lightening. Food? OUT-EFFING-STANDING! I like Five Guys and In-n-Out, actually, I love In-n-Out. But here is what Freddy's does that Five Guys doesn't have or In-n-Out doesn't do...charge extra for a shake instead of a soda. A beverage is a beverage, end of story.  For those who gave Freddy's a less than exuberant review, I implore you to try them again! This doula will be feeding on Freddy's frequently! YUMMO,",

Another thing about the concrete's are that they are huge. The few times we've been there I've needed to share the smallest size because it is too much custard.  The unfortunate side to Freddy's in my opinion is that their chili tastes canned (I know it's from a can, but not everywhere tastes like straight up Hormel chili from a can, which is nasty), the fries suck and are flavorless, unless greasy is the flavor you are going for, and if you order the chili cheese fries they come standard with a gross cheese sauce and in order to get real cheese you have to psychically know that real cheese is an option that you can ask for.   Honestly this place is ok, not great, but definitely better than the other steak burger and shake place near it.",

    "text": "When I was sitting in Freddy's enjoying my burger, I heard some criticism from nearby tables.  I think the overarching criticism of Freddy's - the thin, almost crunchy burgers - merely indicates that people seemed confused about what a steakburger IS.  A steakburger is MEANT to be thin and crunchy.  That's the whole point.  I guess people in this region just don't \"get it\" yet.  If you want your burger thick and juicy, you're at the wrong place.  In that case, I recommend Badger Cafe on Tropicana.    However, if you're like me and just LOVE a steakburger, you've come to the right place.  I'm originally from the Midwest and went to college down the street from a Steak 'N Shake, the king of the steakburger (disclaimer: the Steak 'N Shake in Southpoint is NOT representative of what a Midwest steakburger is...they don't seem to know how to do it right).  I was SHOCKED to find that Freddy's does the steakburger BETTER than Steak 'N Shake!  The meat is flavorful, the cheese is very melty (sorta like In 'N Out), and the bun is light and buttery.  The fry sauce goes well on both the burgers and the fries.  Speaking of fries... I think the fries are the most notable difference between Freddy's and Steak 'N Shake.  Both chains are known for their shoestring fries.  However, Freddy's fries are fried to golden perfection and seasoned with this incredible seasoning salt blend.  SNS is known for undercooked, underseasoned, cold fries that I only find palatable if drenched in piping-hot cheese sauce.    I haven't tried the custard.  I don't eat custard, but I'm curious.  I might make my fiance order it next time so I can live vicariously through him.  Five stars for exactly what it is - a delicious, high-quality STEAKBURGER.  It isn't fair to rate it any other way.  If it isn't your cup of tea... fine!  Great!  More for me!",

Even though the place was quite busy, we were greeted immediately within seconds of going thru the door(literally!). I've got to say that for a fast food place, I was very impressed with the service recieved here. Everyone was rediculously nice and friendly.  After reading the reviews, I had somewhat lowered expectations. Alot of the reviews compare Freddy's to Steak N Shake, which is fair to a certain degree. Living near South Point, I've been to SNS many times, and Freddy's burgers are definately a notch better. The burgers I had last night had a lot more flavor than the burgers I get at SNS, but than again, you will pay a bit more here too. The prices aren't as bad as I had heard, but for 3.19 for a single patty and 4.29 for a double, they aren't exactly cheap either.  Still, though, I really like this place. The great customer service really goes a long way with me. I will definately be back.  4 stars.",

This is a burger has a much thinner patty, is a bit crispy (on the outside), has great toppings, and in all honesty, is one of the better fast food burgers I've had. Decided to go with ol' #1 - because if a #1 can't be done right in a fast food restaurant then they can't do anything right. Burger included two patties, 2 slices of cheese, onion, pickle, and decided to have them substitute the mustard for Freddy's sauce. Excellent choice if I do say so myself. The burger was cooked perfect, crispy outside, not overcooked inside. The Freddy's sauce made the burger & fries spectacular. My order was to go, but I was happy to see that they had Freddy's seasoning salts right at the to go counter available to use prior to leaving the restaurant. Great service, got the food quickly, and I definitely plan on going back.  The decor inside the restaurant is great, very 50's looking - and more importantly it's CLEAN. How often do you walk into a fast food chain restaurant and see tables that look like a flock of 4yo's dominated a smorgasbord?   I can't wait to go back and try some of their custard. If they taste half as good as the pictures look I may be checking back in with a 5 star rating.",

The thing that makes this fast food restaurant different is the atmosphere and friendliness of the crew members! Everyone appears happy and wanting to help clients. The establishment was fairly busy but it maintained clean for the most part. Will definitely be back mostly due to the great customer service we received from the crew! Thanks for an awesome first experience.",

    "text": "I got my hair cut at Roosters, and those folks told about this place because the owners at Freddy's were smart to invite the neighboring business around them a day before this open to a free event.    To business owners, this is a very smart idea, because you have a attentive client who listening to them for at least half hour....but just remember to win them over, which Freddy did.  Freddy's got it right with their name, and it's all about Custard, and Steakburger.    I forgot to bring my carb blockers, but doubled up on fat trappers to tackle the #7 combo of a double steak burger with Bacon.     Ordering was painless, but watching the them put together a Hawaiian blended custard was painful...it's looked pretty killer!      My order was done in four minutes, and I was very happy with the appearance of my burger.   It had a caramelized finish like the old snoop burgers ( I really miss that place)   but I was not too happy with the old bacon, but what the heck, the burger was done right.    These folks nicely season their burger while it's cooking, and this what separates them from Steak n Shake.    The manager does take his rounds in the dining room, and checks on how your doing,    I always feel this what makes or breaks a new business, and listening to your customers feedback is going to be your biggest tool for success.    Good luck Freddys,  you're on the right track.",

    "text": "Cool new place. It's a lot like Steak and Shake except without the shakes. It's like Steak and Custard. (badum bum) We ordered the traditional California burger, the chili cheese fries, and a turttle custard concrete.   The California burger is what you would expect a traditional California steakburger to be (it tastes just like the steak and shake california burger). It's got the thinnly sliced steak burger with the all the California burger fixings.  Now, I do love their chili cheese fries! I'm not a big fan of chili cheese fries only because it's so filling and I get full off it so fast. It's got the steak burger chunks in it with nacho cheese and mini cubes of onion on it. The french fries are also those thinly cut fries which makes it all the more better. You taste more of the chili cheese than the thickness of the fries which I loved.  Now, the turtle custard concrete. DELISH! The custard was nice and thick and super solid! It was rich and creamy. It had all the fixing of a turtle any thing. So the pecans, caramel, and chocolate just made that custard taste so good. If you prefer it premixed and you want to just sip on it, get the concrete. If you dig the helpings on top where you can eat the best of the best first, get the sundae.",

    "text": "Yeah Freddy's!  This is a nice place for a burger and with the kids!  I have to say this is a nice place to try for Burgers and good place to come back to many times.  To me, it is a definite notch above the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's type of places and near quality of Inn and Out.  1.  Ambiance - 5 star - Nice amount of room, people always cleaning and keeping it up.  Even the toilet is very clean and fresh.  I say one of the best when it comes to overall appearance and ambiance.  2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here, from the manager to the staff is top notch.  Helpful, friendly, open to giving suggestions and ideas.  I find them all to be very, very pleasant and makes coming here even better.  You know how some of these fast food places, they get what they pay for.  Here at Freddy's top class!  3.  Food - 3.5 star - The food is pretty good overall.  a.  Fries - 4 star - Best thin fries ever.  Great sauce near the cash register just for the fries and of course the huge ketchup dispenser with small paper cups to douse your fries in.  Very crispy, lightly fried taste, and you will want to grab a bunch. They give you a bunch.  Not like Five Guys, yet certainly plenty.  b.  Steak Burger - 3 star.  Actually enjoyable, easy to palm in your hand and eat, compared to some of the ones at Inn and Out or Five Guys where it is so huge that you have to create a logistics plan on how to eat it.  The taste is nice, nothing spectacular in my book, however, tasty overall.  c.  Hot Dogs - 3 star -  Actually I do like the lightly toasted bun they put it in, so that is a plus.  It is a hot dog and we did not get the chili dog or anything. However, I find that the hot dogs at Costco, in those amazing soft delicate buns are freakiin awesome and something like 1.50 with a drink, so compared to that, it is a good hot dog..... just not mind blowing.    d.  Variations - 4 star - they have plenty of variations, doubles and plenty of your basic condiments. Not over the top and confusing, so that makes it nice for your all around all american burger and dogs.  e.  desserts - 4 star - Oh my, oh my.  you have to leave room for the desserts.  The Turgle, PBC & B, and Chocolate Brownie Delight are great whether as a Sundae or as a Concrete, which is custord mixed in like a shake with all the other ingredients.  Tasty for sure!  I really like this place, professional, tasty , easy to get in, easy to park, easy seating, quality, and nice for family, teens, adults.  Nice!",

It is because I am in love with that burger and I can't let it go. =) My favorite at this joint is the number #6 combo, double steakburger california style (you can request grilled onion and with or without cheese) with drink and fries. The steakburger is tasty and juicy. The fries are thin sliced and crispy, perfect way to eat it. The drink that I always get is the passion fruit iced tea, I like the flavor and taste of the passion fruit. The only negative about this iced tea is that it's warm, I had to put a lot of ice just to drink it and a little sugar to add a little sweetness to it.",

They were thin cut and cooked crispy with a remarkable seasoning.  The fry sauce seems to be a thousand island blend.  THE BAD: The Chophouse was a mess. The buns were soggy and the burger was over seasoned. I wasn't impressed. The patty melt was equally a mess. The melt was not even properly on the bun with barely any cheese  in it.

Single is big enough to look like a double-- the patty is bigger than the bun. I didn't get onions on my burger but didn't realize  that it doesn't come with LT either.. just huge slices of pickle.   Half a burger is big enough to fill you with a few fries. I love the charred flavor of the meat (although it was a little salty). Bun was pretty good too. The fries though.. the fries and sauce. YUMMMM.  What I've licked of my Turtle concrete so far is delish.. only qualm is that it melted so quick on the 3 min drive from Freddy's to my office.  Service is nice and quick!",

    "text": "After trying lots of burgers in Las Vegas it's clear that  Freddy's stands out above the rest in the QSR category. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love In-N-Out, which has great burgers and fries that I've devoured with regularity for over thirty years. And I enjoy the outstanding burgers at Smashburger as much as In-N-Out, equally as good but very different.   When it comes to Freddy's Original Double burger, it arrives seasoned and cooked to perfection every time, so juicy and flavorful with a crisp ring of meat candy around the outer edge. There is nothing like it in the burger world. The fries are mediocre but forgotten with each bite of the burger!   Here is my ultimate testament. I only allow myself one visit per week to any single restaurant, especially burger joints. I do this to keep from getting tired of my favorites and also to avoid packing on unwanted poundage. You can usually find me at Freddy's on Monday because I just can't wait any longer.",

I ordered a Double Cheeseburger and Fries. After receiving my order, I went to eat a couple of fries and they were already lukewarm. They also tasted bland and tasteless.  Once I got home, I tried to warm the fries and they did not taste any better.. even with the fry sauce. The burger did not taste as good as the other location.  I would've expected hot and delicious food for the 15-20 minute wait and am so disappointed that this location isn't following in the footsteps of the Decatur location.",

    "text": "I know it's been a while since my last review, but I finally managed to snag some time to write for you guys! I went here with some friends and I was surprised it was so close to me lol.  If you guys are anything like me, you probably thought this was more of a dessert place because of the word custard in their name, but I can assure you that they also sell yummy American food like hamburgers and hot dogs!  I ordered the number 7 combo on the menu which came with a burger (2 thin patties, bacon, 2 slices of cheese, tomato, lettuce, and onions), fries, and a drink. The burger was alright overall, but the best part was the taste of the patties. The buns were kind of flat and flavorless and the raw onion taste wasn't very appealing to me. Also, the bacon slices were all clustered in one area so it was hard to get an even ratio of bacon with each burger bite. Honestly, I think In and Out still has the best burgers, but this place was a nice change of pace. I do have to say that their fries are skinny, crispy, and just delicious. Soggy fries are never a good thing and I'm glad I didn't have this experience here. They also have a fry sauce which you guys have to try, but I think it is just basically thousand island sauce lol.   I also got the PBC and C sundae which was basically vanilla ice cream topped with pieces of reese's peanut butter cups, banana slices, whipped cream, and a cherry. One thing to note, you can get your dessert in two forms: concrete or sundae. Concrete basically means they will blend in the toppings with the ice cream which makes it easier to eat in terms of cleanliness. It does make the dessert look kind of sad though because it just looks like they used a bunch of ice cream and not as much toppings. The sundae form is messier, but you get to see and TASTE the toppings which I enjoyed when eating the reese's peanut butter cups.   Overall, I'd say this place was decent and is nice to try out if you have never been here. If you really want delicious, cheap burgers, In and Out is still the place to go.",

I walked in to place my to go order of two cheeseburgers and one order of fries, and waited for what I thought was a little too long. (I was mumbling to myself a little as I was tired and ready to go home). When the manager handed me the bag of food, she also handed me 2 complimentary coupons for 2 future combos and apologized for the delay. I was impressed. That's not all. I got all the way home, only to find that I had two grilled cheese sandwiches in my bag instead of cheeseburgers.  I called the store, and came back to make the exchange. The same manager, her name is 'Heaven', was clearly mortified of this second error, not to mention the people who got my cheeseburgers won't be happy either. By the time I got back to make the exchange, Heaven had  refunded the entire amount back to my card, apologized, and thanked me for being so kind.  Did they make a couple of mistakes and give the drive thru people my order and vice-versa? Yes.  Did they do everything they could to make it right? Absolutely. I'll definitely be back. And besides, their food is delicious! Kudos to Heaven for making a potentially angry situation into a happy customer!",

    "text": "I love burgers and this place is awesome! I don't know why it has taken me so long to try it. Every time I'm in the area I see the long line at the drive-thru here so when that many people line up, you know it must be good.   This is my new go-to pre-movie quick dinner before hitting the Colonnade for a film. Freddy's is FAST. I mean, order and you'll get your fresh and hot order in 5 minutes or less. I don't know how they do it. I also don't know how they can have such low prices. Seriously! My husband and I had a soda, cheese fries, double bacon burger and a triple cheeseburger and our total, with tax, was around $16.00. Now you can't beat that for a meal of this quality!  If you are watching your carbohydrate intake or are an Atkins / low-carb eater, Freddy's is wonderfully accommodating! They will wrap your burger in lettuce or just give you the meat with a fork and knife. They don't act weird and employees actually understand that you want a lettuce wrap.   The burgers are very small and thin but they are super flavorful with a nice little \"crust\" around the edge. I would compare them to a cross between Smashburger and In-N-Out. There are lots of free toppings you can add to your meal as well as reasonably priced premium add-ons like chili and bacon. If you are extra hungry, I'd recommend the triple patty burger. That's what I normally order and it's a good size and will take the wrinkles out of your belly (I don't eat fries or bread so I NEED that extra meet and cheese)!   The chili here is kind of gross. I wouldn't recommend it. And if you order the cheese fries, beware that it's not real cheese. They are covered in squirt day-glo fake cheese (like Cheez-Whiz). Yuck. The cheese slices on the burgers are nice and melty however. Don't miss the fry sauce (much loved in Utah) available at the counter. I like to slather it on my cheeseburger (it's basically thousand island dressing).   The menu is simple and straightforward -- burgers, fries, frozen custard and hot dogs. Be sure to ask about any special promotions so you won't miss out on a tasty bbq bacon burger with onion rings!   I've never had the frozen custard here but the desserts and sundaes look super delicious. If you have a kid under 12, buy them a Freddy's t-shirt for $5 and each time they wear it to the restaurant and buy a kid's meal, they'll get free frozen custard. Luckily they don't have a promotion like this for adults or I'd weigh about 400 pounds.  The soda fountain has Pepsi products and Diet Dr. Pepper! The interior dining room has a red and white vintage vibe and is spotlessly clean. Ample seating and friendly employees. I love this place and I am fast on my way to becoming a regular.",

My wife was in the mood for a burger so we were on the way to Red Robin when we saw Freddys across the street. Good time to try the place. She got the double burger and I opted for the chicken breast. This is really a fast food place (along the lines of a McDonalds) rather than a sit down (like Red Robin). The double burger had two really thin paddies (where's the beef??) and a bland bun. Very unexciting. She got onion rings with it. Now those were tasty. My chicken breast sandwich was OK. Big piece of chicken, very bland bun. Came with a big side of fries. The fries were really good. Skinny fries, crispy, and not too salty. Yummm. Since custard is in the name, I wasn't gonna leave without trying one. Got a cup of concrete. Now that was really good. I'm not running back for a burger or a chicken sandwich, but I will certainly return for a custard dessert!",

Upon entering on one of their \"Grand Opening\" days I was pretty impressed with the atmosphere.  However, the service there was not impressive. ---I'm not impressed :T  I came up to the register ordered a patty melt & a hot dog.   So, when i went to pay my order and made a comment on how there was a lot of workers/trainees; the girl that was helping me gave me a snide response back (whoa! ok lady calm down.)  When we received our orders and tasted it: the patty melt was just plain and gross. A The hot dog was okay, but i'd rather go to costco & i would get a bigger hotdog for a cheaper price. The quality of the food and for the price we paid at Freddys, wasnt a place we wanted to go back to. However, we did go back since our friends told us to  go try their steakburger & not some patty melt.   Part 2:  I suppose the service was better this time around, but the food was sighs, ewww. We ordered the steakburger and the significant other said, \"it tastes like a mcdonalds burger\" LOL. oh geez, i guess he wasnt impressed, either.  The steakburger didn't taste like anything and all i can taste was the bun.    Sorry, Freddy's but you lost this time.",

    "text": "Vegas gets another new burger joint. I really was never going to go out of my way to eat at Freddy's, but because I happened to be on the side of town where it is located getting my nails done with my sister we decided to go here. I just so happened to see it when we were driving around.  The inside reminds me of an Inn N Out with obnoxiously nice employees. I know, how can employees be so nice they are obnoxious? When while in the course of being there for about 30 minutes and we are asked how everything is about 4 times. Okay, I'm complaining for nothing... I concede to the fact. But I am assuming the niceties will only last for so long, until Freddy's is just the 2nd Steak & Shake in Vegas.  Okay food - I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a soda, the combo. My sister ordered a hot dog and a water. We shared the fries - it's a good thing we did. The fry portions are massive, which basically does not surprise me anymore. They are shoestring fries though, kind of refreshing... as far as french fries goes.  My sister said her \"Chicago\" dog was tasty and good. My burger was good too. Now I've had the whole \"Steakburger\" thing. I don't know... is it better than other burgers? I just can't decide. I mean, it was good, but... uuuhhh, I just don't know. I'm just not really impressed.  Would I go back? Isn't that what it comes down to? When I go get my nails done and on that day I feel like a burger, perhaps I'll stop by Freddy's. But to go out of my way to come here? Nah.   PS - They have fry sauce. Obvi everyone knows this is ketchup and mayo, but yea, still... FRY SAUCE.",

What I found was an amazingly fresh burger (cooked to order). The pickles were a nice touch (long, bun length) and the bun was toasted just right! My only knock is that the bacon was just ok and you need to add some sauce to the burger as mustard was the only thing on there. But, Im sure if you play around with it you'll find your perfect way. First impression thought is that It still lacks in the signature taste department compared to In N Out, but this is the best #2 I've found... And that's saying a lot!   The custard was to die for! Tried a turtle sundae and I wasn't disappointed at all. I think next time it will be the Hawaiian one... Actually, it will be up to the wife to choose the next one so who knows!

I got a patty melt to go with my fries that tasted nothing like potato.  The bread was very buttery which is awesome.  The onions were thoroughly grilled.  Cheese was nice and melted.  The patty was unimpressive though.  Beef was super thin and then smashed even thinner for good measure.  Similar to how you can't taste the potato in shoestring fries, you can't taste the meat in the super thin smashed over cooked patty.  Ice Cream looked good, but I didn't have a chance to try.  Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly.  It's a bit more expensive, but Five Guys is still the king of trendy burger joints.  They have real french fries and juicy patties.  Also, Red Robin is quite excellent (AYCE steak fries!) if you are okay with being non-trendy and can deal with the annoying kids running around.",

So  my burger was kind like the protein burger from In and Out.  The only problem was, the patties were under seasoned.  I think this may have been the first time ever I had to salt my burger.  The patties were smashed so they're flat kinda like smash burgers' patties.  I was a bit disappointed about how, the only difference between my burger and whatever it is my husband ordered was that, mine had tomatoes.

They had a minimum 2 people doing nothing but cleaning up in the dining room. It was impressive. McDonalds, BK, Wendy's take a lesson in customer service from these people. They do everything but park your car for you. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Today was Veterans day. The cashier asked if I was a Veteran. Said yes, she shook my hand and thanked me for my service.

The patties are very thin, smashed down and well done. So get a double. It's not messy at all (darn) and dry. You have to pay extra for lettuce and tomato- I was like whaaaat. The \"butter toasted\" buns didn't have that satisfying buttery taste I expected. We also ordered the patty melt. The bread on the melt was some herbed variety that I found more jarring than harmonious. The fries are shoestring fries dusted in seasoning. It was a generous amount of fries. They did give me ranch without having me pay for it, but it was warm from a box. Good thing it was loaded with preservatives.  I know people have a cult mentality for this chain, but it didn't feel it. I'd return to try a concrete. I guess I imagined a messy drippy burger.",

It's hard to describe them, I would say the best way is if you took a steak, chopped it up very fine with a knife, and somehow were able to put it back all together. It's not the greatest description so you will have to go there and find out for yourself. The meat itself could have used a tad more seasoning. Shoestring fries were perfectly cooked. Thin and crispy, again, just a little bit more seasoning. All the employees were very friendly and even the manager came out to see if everything was OK, I liked that. Those milkshakes looked amazing, gonna have to try some next time.",

The fries are skinny - don't like that and the custard is watery - don't like that either. We had to return the chicken fingers cause it was fried too long so it was to hard to eat. The employees were all attentive and I was given a free meal comp. for the next time .The special sauce for the fries is good but nothing else really does it for me at all. I had a chocolate brownie sundae concrete which surprisingly wasn't very chocolatey at all and the other time I had a vanilla concrete with banana's and marshmallows - I didn't tast any marshmallows and the banana's were minimal.My daughter loves the free WIFI - but all in all I honestly have no desire to come back.",

No grilled onions, on sourdough, and with fry sauce and bacon.  Yes, that is my main attraction - FRY SAUCE! Love the stuff. I agree with the Yelpers that say it is like Steak N Shake, also with the Yelpers who say the burgers are a bit dry. Since I dunk every bite in the FRY SAUCE, I really don't care. Their onion rings have been outstanding. (Dipped in FRY SAUCE), perfectly golden brown and crunchy just the right size for soaking in...yeah, you got it, and beautifully crunchy. Personally I love the shoestring fries as well.....need I say what ladens each crunchy bite?   Kudos on having more than one diet drink, though I wish it were Diet Mountain Dew rather than Diet Dr. Pepper.   Haven't had any of the custards since my combo lasts me at least two meals. The combos were all a little strange, but I will try a cone or dish sometime.  Overall, Freddy's is a welcome change from the prior Fazoli's and I will probably be back for, at least, the onion rings and......FRY SAUCE!",

He was upbeat and very friendly while he explained the concept and different menu offerings. I opted for the California burger with cheese fries. The burger was very bland. The cheese on the fries was the cheap melted cheddar cheese that reminded me of old high school cafeteria lunch cheese. I wouldn't opt for this place again. The price was higher than average burger joint like In N Out. The stars are mainly for the friendly employee and clean/spacious restaurant.",

The employees wouldn't even let us throw away our own trash! lol  The burgers were fresh and delicious.  I may like this place better than five guys for quick burgers!  The fries are shoestring and very tasty.  Especially with some of their seasoning.  The custard is smooth, creamy, and delicious.  And the prices are so reasonable.  I think of getting a frozen treat at a place like cold stone and, although it's like comparing apples and oranges, I enjoy custard SO much more and it's usually so much cheaper!

I ate it and loved every sinful bite of it. I did it for America and for Thanksgiving really. Now on that special day in November instead of sitting around a table with my family pretending to LOVE that kind of food I get to be home, alone grubbing on Thai takeout which I enjoy so much more. I might even eat it in my bed, and not shower and drink my Thanksgiving away. This will lead to several explicit drunk texts I will knowingly regret the next day, but my friends will be entertained. Yup, that's how I will give thanks.   Back to the hotel...I mean the concrete. Charlie Brown would even agree it's the Great Pumpkin.  If you dig pumpkin pie at all they shove the whole shabang in there including the soft crust, pumpkin filling, nutmeg, whipped cream and crop dust it all with cinnamon. You don't have to wait until November to give thanks. Do it for your country and sweet tooth today and grub on this goodness!

McDonalds started with the fish sandwich many years ago and others have followed suit. Without commenting on any other fish sandwiches, Freddy's fish sandwich is among the top of the list. Crispy, hot and full of flavor, this sandwich is two pieces of fish in a fried batter, served on a toasted white bun with a slice of cheese and a \"Freddy's\" sauce (tasted like 1000 island).  On this day, I chose the sandwich and the fish and chips. I hope these two items become part of the regular menu. Both are worth the money and a great addition to the already amazing menu. If I were to give one piece of criticism, it would be the pricing for the hot dogs. The dogs are pretty spendy. Although they a delicious, there is just no value for the hot dogs. If you're going to eat at a fast food restaurant, skip the chain places and go to Freddy's. Simple food done well, good pricing, and some of the friendliest employees in Las Vegas. Keep up the good work Freddy's.",

Customer service is great!  Everyone is friendly, and they'll even clean your table for you.  I know some fast food places are picking up on that and it's a cool feature.  This place reminds me a lot of Steak 'n' Shake, but seeing as I lived in Texas for several years I do like SnS better.  However, Freddy's is certainly nothing to shake a stick at.  Easier location to get to and plenty of seating for all!  Their prices are higher than SnS but they also have a drive-thru (huge plus).  Taste-wise, I enjoy it.  I've had the fries, fries sauce, and burgers.  Those three are pretty darn tasty.  I definitely could NOT eat here every day because the meals are heavy (I ate around 2:30 pm and now 6 and some change hours later I still feel it in my tummy), but it's great to relax and get a bite with a friend.  Want to try their chili cheese fries... Perhaps next time.  Mmm I love chili cheese fries.",

You all know by now that I'm a Chicago transplant, so when I saw a sign advertising \"Chicago style Hotdogs\" while driving down Eastern in search of feed... I immediately thought, \"Oh no. This is dangerous. If they screw this up I'm going to have go on Yelp and TEAR em' apart! Don't me do this!\" and I'll do it... I've done it!    But, thankfully, this didn't have to happen.  :-)  I'll say flat out that the hotdog wasn't \"Gene & Judes good\", but it was definitely good. As soon as I took the first bite, a memory swept across my mind... leaving Hot Doug's on California, hooking a right on Addison, I was heading home again! The right toppings, which of course includes pretty much everything but ketchup (don't you dare), a nice buttered up bun and most importantly... the right kind of dog. You have to hear the \"break\"... and you do! Real Chicago Hotdog lovers know exactly what I mean by \"hearing the break\".  The fries were just alright. I tend to like a thicker french fry so I'm not going to dock them for that as it's a matter of personal preference. I will definitely be back for the dogs and I will be trying the steakburger and frozen custard next time.   Regards, CFC",

    "text": "Came here for the first time by recommendation by a coworker. We couldn't think of what to eat and he came up with this place. Located right across from Krispy Kreme in the huge Target Plaza on Silverado Ranch & Eastern, next to Freed's Bakery.   They offer a drive-thru option, which was what i picked. The idea of steakburgers reminds me of Steak & Shake in South Point Casino & Hotel. Thin, flat-topped cooked burger patties and shoestring fries. Made my car smell very yummy !   The fries, you actually get quite the bit. Both orders were full to the brim and falling out into the bag. Lightly seasoned and salted. Pretty yummy ! Quite similar to what you'd get from Steak & Shake, but much more in quantity  They don't have a lot of burger options but they are fairly simple burgers, without all the fluff. No chili cheese or guacamole or BBQ sauce. Only simple original single/double/triple, bacon and cheese, California style, and patty melt  We had ordered a Double Steakburger California Style which includes two steakburger patties, cheese, full slice of onion, Freddy's sauce, lettuce, and tomato served on a toasted bun.   Overall a fairly simple burger with the normal fixings. Lettuce was chopped up vs the usual leaf of lettuce you'd usually see. A full slice of onion is not a ring or two of onion, but literally a centimeter cross section of an onion with all the rings it inside. Patties are pressed quite flat with cheese in between. Not sure what Freddy's sauce is as I couldn't really taste where/what it was.   Can't compare to the nearby places like Red Robin or In-n-Out or Shake Steak. Completely different. Closest thing is Steak & Shake and i find it quite comparable to each other. Great to have another place that offers steakburgers outside of South Point. Much more easily accessible. It is a pretty decent size burger in comparison to what you'd get in Steak & Shake. Prices are comparable, if not better pricing than Steak & Shake.",

Every single time I've ate here it's been excellent. The burgers freshly made, and the fries still nice and warm. I love how they don't add seasoning to fries, and you could add to your taste. To top it off, Freddy's dipping sauce hmmmm goes so well with the burger and fries. Oh and can't forget they have custards too and they are a must try.",

I should've kept the other patty because what they give you is a joke. I got cheese fries which were ok probably because i was still hungry after eating my bread sandwich. What a waste of money.

That mind you, is comming from someone born and raised in Wisconsin which is know for their shakes/malts and custard, thinlk Leon's and Copp's in Milwaukee. I usually like to try the vanilla shake because vanilla is kind of a litmus test.  If the vanilla they serve is good all the other flavors will inevidebelty be good. I got a mino choc shake which was as good as anything you will find in wisconsin. Also tried the oreo concrete which isn't quite as good as dairyqueens blizzard, but still very good.     So now on to the food lol, I had the chilli cheese fries and a single steakburger w/ onoins ketchup and mmustard.  The burgers are very good the best part of it is the nice thin pattie which is crispy and kind of burnt on the edges which I really like. Reminds me of 5 guys patties. The bun isn't exaclty my fave, I prefer True german thin hard rolls.  But regardless the bun is stil fresh and good.  The chilli cheese fries are great, more or less shoestring(really really thing) fries with a cheese sauce which is pretty good and not artificial tasting at all likke a lot of cheesse fries from other places tend to be. All the other toppings seemed to be of good quality and tasted good.  Overall, I have found a new fave joint to go to 3 or 4 times a month.  I really like it that much.  Of and also they really have increible service and get your food out crazy quick.",

Our favorite is the turtle but with chocolate iced cream...big chunks of pecans and bunches of carmel you need a very fat straw.  A friendly place with great food and great service. It's a winner every time.",

I decided to go inside, we were the only ones in the place.  Didn't get that overly welcome feeling I always get when I come here.  I got the Turtle concrete and hubby got the M&M concrete.  When we came home, it was hardly blended at all!  The yummy chocolatety goodness, pecans on mine were at the bottom, same for the M&M's in hubby's concrete.  I told the cashier it was to go, but we got the overflowing cup and had to ask for a lid.  Not cool at all.  But, since it is tasty, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to an off night.",

There is nothing that comes close to the richness and creamy texture of their frozen treats. The shakes come with with a straw big enough to launch a cashew through (when you are done drinking).  PLUS, they have hot dogs and Philly steak sandwiches too.  If you order a burger, make sure to get a double or triple.  The single patty burgers are great for the little ones.  Did I mention that the frozen custard alone is worth the trip??? If you have a soft serve ice cream fetish, this is your place! Caution! This place IS addictive.",

You can keep it simple with one topping or go crazy and choose a specialty concrete with lots of toppings.  I keep it simple and just add good 'ol Oreo cookies with vanilla custard. Delicious and way better than stupid McDonald's McFrankenstein-Flurry. I've also had a taste of the chocolate concrete with peanut butter added in and it was delicious! Way less sweet than if Reese's peanut butter cups were added in, but that's just me.   Someday I'll have to try a steakburger. It smells pretty darn good inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "Freddy's burgers and fries hit the spot.  Always.  The concept and food is very similar to Steak n Shake - but I think the burgers might be better here!    In a twist of burger irony, we tried to eat at In-N-Out burger on Easter Sunday night  around 6pm, but they were closed. So we headed for Freddy's because burgers and fries were calling our name.  The California burger has a sauce similar to thousand island dressing - which is my favorite burger.  The fries are shoestring style.    If you don't want too many fries, then share a plate.  Each burger comes with a gazillion fries - you can easily save money by sharing one order. The kids meals also come with a gazillion fries, so skip the kids meal and just order a  solo burger and share your fries with the kiddos!    For my 3-year old and myself, we walked out feeling very full for a mere $12.  Freddy's is a very family friendly place.  The staff is always super nice!",

    "text": "After spending 10 hours moving in 112 degree heat yesterday I was craving a burger. Thanks to Yelp I found out that Freddy's is about a five minute drive from my new place so I had to check it out!  Before I get into the food I want to mention the awesome customer service I experienced in the drive through last night.  I hate customizing orders, especially in a drive thru, because I never want to be THAT person. Unfortunately none of their burgers were exactly what I was craving which meant I had to customize a little bit. I took a deep breath before ordering, fully expecting it to be a headache for me and the person taking my order. I ordered my boyfriends food first because his was a normal order, and was happy to be greeted by a friendly employee. She took my order with enthusiasm and happily repeated my entire order back to me, customizations and all. She was just as friendly at the window when she handed me my food. I checked my order and everything was there. She also put in a lot of ketchup just like I asked her to. It seems really minor, but most fast food places either forget the sauces all together, or give me one ketchup packet. It's not very often I leave a fast food place happier than I came there in! Everything food wise was fantastic. I got a double steak burger california style with pickles. The burger patties were thin and flavorful. All of the veggies added the right amount of crispness and coolness to offset the grease.  I loved that the fries were shoestring fries. I also ordered a chocolate concrete which was amazing. I couldn't eat it all so it's dessert for after another long day of moving. All in all, super glad I moved close to a tasty burger place with great customer service. I will definitely be back again soon!",

I took a little break to digest then had to order a vanilla custard in a waffle cone.   It was smooth, rich and absolutely delicious.   It was like whoever Freddy is went to Culvers, Steak & Shake and Smashburger and combined the best of each into one place.   My advice:  Go. Go right now. You won't regret it.   My only complaint:  why aren't there more of these?",

I love the fact that they sale bottles of Freddy's fry seasoning and fry sauce. so much so that I bought a couple of bottles to take home... Gotta luv that fry sauce",

We opted to eat in and glad we did the restaurant was very lively atmosphere. We needed to be around people . Freddy's friendly staff and customers and welcoming place hit the spot.  I ordered the Freddy's number one which was Freddy's original and it was fantastic. The price of the combo is around 8.00 but it is well worth it in the quality of the beef and cheese. The bread they use is just the right soft and for American food Freddy's is an original.",

These are the type of burger places you see in all the good 80s/90s movies.   Now let's get to the meaty stuff, food details.   Love the chili cheese hot dog! The chili is always flavorful and it's not like chili beans, it's more liquid and meaty combination perfect for a beef dog.   The patty melt is delicious. The sauce they put on it has a unique kick. Reminds me of the secret sauce on McDonald's Big Macs. I'm sure this one is healthier though.   Chicken strips on the kids menu are thick and fill you up. My daughter couldn't even finish them all. French fried are skinny fries, crispy too.   Desserts are rich, thick, and the custard doesn't taste too eggy sweet. More vanilla then anything.   Customer service is amazing. I've even told them when I wanted to make my own weird dessert custard combination and they made it happen!   Happy fat girl, happy yelp review!",

So after checking out their menue I decided to order the same thing I ordered last time. The number 4 and the girl taking my order asked me if I wanted to make that a combo? I asked if the number 4 was just a patty melt for $8.99? If so I was going to walk out and go to the in n out burger right down the street.   At that point the manager stepped in and said that the number 4 included a fry and a drink for $8.99 so I asked if she wants to know if I want an additional fry and drink with my combo? The manager told the girl to step aside and let her take this order.  The manager says one number 4 combo. That will be $8.99 Plus tax.   Now I see why I only come here once every couple of years especially when in n out is right down the street from here.  On the plus side they do serve diet Dr pepper.",

My boyfriend and I had placed an order for a veggie burger and a hatch Chile steakburger meal. The food was out within 3-4 minutes of us ordering! Amazing! The fries were like matchsticks and so delicious. Like I said, the veggie burger was so tasty and filling. My boyfriend loved his pepper burger and the fry sauce that they have. We were both pretty stuffed, and by that I mean STUFFED, but we really wanted to try their frozen custard. We decided to share a mini pbc&c which is a peanut butter cup and banana (with cherry) concrete... A weird name for a really thick shake. :)  It was so amazing but I really wanted to barf by the end of it. Completely my fault for having no self control, but I blame them for having such good food.  The only thing that makes me sad about this place is how far it is from me. The completely opposite side of town but it is totally worth it.   For my veggie burger and my boyfriend's meal together, the total only came to $12. Add that mini concrete and it came to $16. So worth it for the gorging and wanting to barf (aka me not being able to control myself with their delicious food right in front of me). We'll definitely be coming back!",

Their supposedly \"addictive\" fry sauce is an over hyped 1000 Island dressing, that should be slathered on all their burgers if it's that special. The shoestring fries were good and generous portion. The restaurant itself had a Diner type feel. Looking at the diners will tell you that if you've seen the inside of a gym lately, you shouldn't be eating at Freddy's. Last night was about rebelling a little,  but given the quality and taste of the food,  I could have made a more satisfying choice of places to indulge. Their service was very friendly, leading me to think they hired a good group and/or Freddy's treats their employees right.",

The fries are of the shoe string style- a little bit bigger maybe, but nothing to go back for.  I would probably hit the In N Out next time, but this wasn't bad.

Bigger building than I thought, and very quick at taking your orders, I went at a lunch time and only had about 4 people ahead of me which was a 5 min wait. Upon getting my hot dog \"a chili cheese with onions hot dog\" and string fries, I went over to the condiment station.  I recommend the fry sauce next to where you pick up your order, it's a wonderful blend of mayo and ketchup (well that's what it tasted like to me) but it goes great with the hot fries. The hot dog was perfect, no way you can eat it with your hands you have to use a knife and fork, but the pop you get from the hot dog when you bite into it was great and the chili was beefy and very tasty it was not spicy but with the melted cheese and fresh white onions it went great with the dog. I will be going back to try their Steakburger as they looked great as well. If your in the area I would highly recommend this place for a good quality meal for very few $$$$$$",

I do have a friend who enjoys coming here, but I can't comprehend why...it is family friendly. It's another steak and shake to me, which also have me a stomach ache and made for a regretful evening.   Bottom line: not worth the calories when there are so many better options within a 1/2 mike radius.",

Their whole environment was pretty nice! clean bathrooms (yay!) and a well kept up parking lot! I was surprised to see a drive-thru! then again... this is Vegas! how awesome is that!  but I'm not lazy, I like to take my time when I can and enjoy what I paid for! lol!!!  As far as the food went:  YUM-O!  I love the lil fries and to top it off that crazy sauce!!! lol  the fries had MY right amount of salt! (I'm downing lots of water tonight! lol)  so, if you don't like too much salt, hey! mention it!!  you'll get fresh fries I bet! the steak burger single was what I ordered. it was just right for me, but now I know when I come back hungry: double it plz!!  I got all but the onions... usually I don't do the pickles... but I figured, why not!  and boy did that make a yummy difference! it was snappy!  I like the clean counter access of big humongous over size foster family size ketchup to top my burger any which way possible!!! :-)  lol!!    I like the variety a lot! Since I am cutting back on my splurging, I didn't try the custard... but! that means another reason to go back!  momma always said, ice cream never goes bad in the winter, I'm assuming that goes for Custard!    so, when winter comes, I will be swinging by!  hopefully, they'll be playing some 50's rock n roll to change the mood!  thumbs up!",

    "text": "Shame on you Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers! I went in yesterday for lunch with my brother. We both wanted to try the \"Original Double Patty Melt\". So you would think that when they say a burger or a patty melt is a \"double\", it's going to look like what you would find at In & Out Burger or Tommy's or Wendy's, etc, etc. You expect to see 2 burger patty's! So I get my order and look at it. I look at my brother and ask if what I had ordered was in fact a \"Double Patty Melt\". He assured me I had. I looked at my receipt and that's what I paid for. But I see a paper-thin poor excuse of a beef patty (Oh my god! You could see through the fucking thing!) laying inside 2 slices of bread smothered in grilled onions. Confused, I went to the counter and advised the cashier that they had given me the wrong order. She puts on rubber gloves and proceeds to \"finger my patty melt\" in order to show me that there are 2 beef patty's under in between the 2 slices of bread. Get this, they cut the sandwich right down the middle so that you have a patty on each half. But they make sure that the ends that are cut have the patty's over-lapping each other by maybe an inch. So as long as those ends overlap, they can call it a \"Double Patty Melt\". I'm thinking out loud \"Well that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. The sandwich isn't big enough to justify cutting it down the middle.\" So, it's not really a \"Double\". It's just two incredibly small and paper-thin beef patty's set side-by-side on even smaller slices of bread. Never again Freddy's! Very misleading. Oh and by the way... NEVER EVER PUT RUBBER GLOVES ON AND DISMANTLE YOUR PATRONS FOOD IN FRONT OF THEM AND EXPECT THEM TO EAT IT AFTERWARD! DISGUSTING!",

The (Hawaiian Delight) frozen custard sundae was so good, my husband and I came back the following day and brought along my in-laws along to try it!  I did knock a star off for the patty melt and chili cheese fries that I had tried on our first visit which I thought were just \"meh-okay tasting,\" but like I said the frozen custard is so good it didn't stop us from coming back.   Our kids enjoyed the Dirt 'N Worms sundaes (vanilla custard, Oreo crumbles, gummy worms, whipped cream and a cherry) and Chocolate Shakes.   The Hawaiian Delight sundae consisted of yummy vanilla custard, pineapple, strawberry, coconut, macadamia nuts, whipped cream and a cherry. I also tried the PBC & B sundae (vanilla custard, Reese's peanut butter cup pieces, bananas, whipped cream and a cherry) which was tasty as well but not as great as the Hawaiian Delight.",

I LOVE THIS PLACE.   Thin steak burgers with a crispy edge.... assembled with care (unlike the Wendy's stuff that looks like a big girl just sat on it). Pickles were fresh and plentiful, placed with care across the entire burger. I stress \"with care.\" They do apparently and it makes all the difference in the world.  The shoe-string french fries are the best! Thin, so they get crispy (unlike the crap they serve and Raisin Cains... great chicken and bread but sorry guys, your \"steak fries\" suck). I LOVE FREDDY'S FRIES!  The service was fast and friendly. The young senorita at the drive through had a smile that made me happy to be there and her eyes sparkled like the Nile. Bless that nice young lady.   These burgers and fries are good enough that they could eventually bring world peace.   Great job guys! You're my new favorite eat spot for the blessed American burger.",

I was sorely disappointed. The sheer amount of salt used on these fries rendered them inedible. My little girl is a french fry fanatic and barely touched hers. They were almost painful to eat. I was approached by a server and asked if I would like to try the fry salt. Um, no. I feel like I'm already dipping chunks of a salt lick in ketchup. The concretes and other goodies looked yummy, maybe next time we'll just go for treats and not lunch. The staff seemed very friendly and the service was good.",

I got home and to my surprise my order was wrong because they were to busy wanting to close up and go home to get my order right. I understand how it feels for a customer to come at the last minute when you're ready to go home, but that doesn't mean you just don't do your job the way it's supposed to be done. The girl in the drive through had an attitude and clearly didn't want to waste her last few minutes at work helping a customer that was the first thing that made my experience not so great, and then to have to correct them on one part of my order only to get home and see my order was made wrong made this experience pretty terrible. I still love the food at Freddy's and I normally have great costumer service when I go, but clearly you can't go right before they close or you'll be treated as though your business isn't wanted or needed.

And then after all that which was a great experience ....the manager gave me a comp chocolate custard...which was delish! ...crazy cool fast food joint.

The burger was actually really good with a soft bun and the burger itself was cooked perfect and very good. You get skinny fries which are good and the cheese on top since I ordered cheese fries made them great.  I also order the traditional Turtle Sunday.  It was super delicious with nice just the right amount of hot fudge and caramel with nice big walnuts. Will defiantly return when I want a good burger fast and easy. They have a drive thru.",

It's up there next  to In n Out lol  First lets start with the customer service since they are always so nice and cheerful when I walk in like they missed me or something. On our first visit there they gave us a free custard and they come around and take your trash, it's the little things that matter.   Second the steak burger is quite amazing I leave it original and love my fries crispy. The fries my just be my favorite they are thin and crispy and not greasy. I also like their hot dogs they are amazing I can't even describe.   Then finally their custards are like little cups of heaven. Something like ice cream but smoother and with tons of extra toppings.   Overall a great place to eat and take the family.",

Have one with hatch chills and your toes curl. Don't let em talk you into a special. Why? Because the classic Freddie's double classic is perfect. Have you ever had a burger so good, it's lacey? That's what smashburger dreams of. It's what in n out has forgotten.  But Freddy's has perfected it. Truly.   Trust me. And this is just about a burger.  Totally the most underrated burger in Vegas.  In America.  Way better than Shake Shack if you're want validation.  Look. My first shake shack was great. Mind blowing,  my second a let down. Freddie's was perfect the first time, and has never disappointed. And it continues to be crave-worthy.     Fries are thin, crispy, they're good. Only complaint is you have to eat them in the parking lot because they're cold before you can get them home.   Onion rings! Frozen custard?  I love those things but the burger and friy combo is so good and so many calories, I can't allow myself to indulge in more.  But you should.  And let me know.",

The steak burgers are thin in patties and cheese w/ onions make it extra tasty. The fries are crips and thin.

My one tip is to maybe ask if there are any vegetarian options or dairy free, I didn't and I have my doubts about whether they do. That or don't bring that person you know who doesn't eat meat. As for the service. I've definitely had better service, I would like to blame it on our coming in two hours before closing, but not really though. There were plenty of other guests in the diner and drive thru, and I didn't really didn't feel welcome in their cafe.  As for the food, if you're looking for an alternative to in n out, I recommend giving them a shot; they aren't better, but they are comparable.",

Honestly I was blown away by the service we received upon entering we were greeted by various people. Once getting up to the register we were helped by a guy named Aaron. He provided service with a smile and answered all our questions about the menu, not only did he have tons of patience but he also made sure we got the best deal possible. After we were all rung up he realized we had never tried their custard and brought us some samples of the different flavors. They were all DELICIOUS . My Mother and Daughter loved the vanilla custard and my son and I were big fans of the chocolate. For our meals my Mom got a Patty Melt which I took a bite of and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious their burger patties were. I got myself a Chicago dog to try. It was so good not only was the flavor combo awesome the hot dog bun was cooked to perfection. Both my kids also enjoyed their kids meals which came with tons of fries. I would of gone back to this place just for the service alone but now I plan to come back to enjoy some more yummy food and next time I plan to save room for dessert.",

    "text": "My Freddy's experiences are like high school dating. The first time out was awesome. It was like she could do no wrong and everything was good. But the second date, or in this case a visit is the one where you quickly learn she's not a keeper and she's got some real annoyances that makes you glad when she gets out of the car and you can drive away. I like Freddy's...the hamburgers are flavorful and the service is fast, but things are not quite as they should be. The California steakburgers sound good but beyond the steakburger itself it's just lacking flavor. Perhaps changing the toppings might help. And the onion rings this time were hard to chew, and in one case didn't seem to be quite fully cooked as if the staff was rushing the orders.   But as I write this I have to call out their concrete as a failure. When I think of a concrete for dessert my mind instantly compares it with one of America's standardbearers, Ted Drewes frozen custard off Historic Route 66 in St. Louis, Missouri. They offer a simple test for a concrete. Turn the cup upside down. If it stays put it's legit. If it starts to run and drip it's a pretender. My Freddy's cup maybe got to 120 degrees of rotation before failing miserably. And while the Hawaiian was supposed to have pineapple and macadamia nuts and other goodies in it, this concrete was boring. So much so that I dumped it in the trash.   Will I go back? Yeah, but In-N-Out will likely see my car in their drivethrough ordering Animal style before Freddy's does.   3 Stars. Sorry but it's the best I can give.",

Not! They were packed inside! A parking lof full of customers pulling in to enjoy some goodness... I'm a mom on the run running errands with a toddler in the backseat since 7:00 am.. So  picking up lunch and enjoying it at home is always the best choice for me.   The drive thru cashier was soo sweet. She never said anything when i added more things to my order as we waited for our food in the drive-thru. I considered ordering a shake and opted out when she took my order at the speaker...Then, as we waited i changed my mind. You only live once right?   I get home and we dig in.. The best chicken fingers i have had in my life. Not greasy nor stale like other joints. Just simply crispy and hot all the way through the very last one. (This was 15mins after i left the drive-thru). I ordered the large order (6pcs) for about $7. It was well worth it. I would go back just for those.   Their apple pie shake is to die for. That was gone by the time i was halfway home. Every spoonful had pie crust and filling along with creamy vanilla custard. Your tastebuds would go nuts with this one.   I'm not a fan of their shoe string fries, those were cold and hard by the time I got home. But my son loved them. He gave them a 5/5 as he dipped them in ketchup.  The single burger was delicious. Like the ones dad used to make on the grill growing up. Delicious and well-done.   Thumbs up for Freddy's, they are doing burgers right over there.",

    "text": "Some pretty tasty burgers right here! I had a steak burger w/cheese. When I 1st looked at it I'm like \"that's kinda on the thin side for the patties\" but I soon realized (I think) that it was because it was pressed down like that when they cooked it. You would think that because it was cooked like that, that it would be dry, but that wasn't the case. As matter of fact there was still enough pink in the middle. I also enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and the little char taste of it. I appreciate how the onions weren't overdone in content like some places, so I didn't have to make a mess picking it off. I also liked the how they used long pickle slices that were not overly sour. I ate the skinny fries on the way home, which is my M.O. when ordering drive-thru and they were perfectly crisp with just the right saltiness. I don't know if I was trippin' or not, but I thought i tasted a hint of garlic in the background? @the drive thru, I saw an advertisement for a drink called the \"pumpkin pie concrete\" but decided to be cheap and passed it up, but by the time I got to the window,  it was more than enough time for me to contemplate and ordered a regular :) good thing I did because it well worth it! It had nice chunks of pie crust and the spice was an excellent compliment. If you're a burger connesiur and have found yourself in a rut, then this is the change of pace that you've been looking for!  Tip: whatever you're about to overspend on steaks n shakes @southpoint save it for Freddy's and while at Freddy's, eat the fries while still warm.   P.S. thanks to bro. Bong for his recommendation to this place.",

My patty melt at Freddy's came sliced thinly with cheese and caramelized onions with the bread being a little burnt on the edges.    We also ordered a strawberry funnel cake, this place's definite saving grace.   I would go back when I have a funnel cake craving.  Little things about the service also detract a star from me.  For example, along with the kid's meal chicken nuggets, we clearly specified to have ranch dressing.  When we pick up our food, no sauce whatsoever.    I'll definitely give this place another try sometime.   Due to their extensive types of burgers on the menu.",

Oh, and a regular burger is a double- be warned. For those of you who aren't feelin that-, they have a California burger. More classic style with a fry sauce, lettuce and tomatoes.  You can tell everything is fresh, and they use a good quality beef. The also offer hot dogs, shakes, malts, and fries.  Usually I don't even review fast food- but this is one place I can go when I don't want fast food, but I still want cheap and convenient.  I have seen them do specials too, like a green chile burger. And they will customize, want grilled onions, just ask.  This is how fast food should be. Why people still eat Mcdonalds when there is Freddys, baffles me!",

The dining area was clean and they have wifi for the guests, also my phones gps is odd but I was able to hit up the freeds pokestop wile munching on shoestring fries (all the reviews say they're legit, it's True) so was even able to set up a lute and caught a charmander.

    "text": "3.5 stars.  Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is apparently known for their burgers and custard, but I haven't tried either! The first visit I only ordered fries because I'm not into burgers and wasn't too hungry. I also hit up the drive-thru on my first visit so I still wasn't sure what Freddy' s was all about and since hubby was in the mood for a burger I suggested we go back and try this place again. Since Freddy' s promotes Chicago dogs outside their building and the fact that they use vienna all beef hot dogs, I figured they were based out of Chicago. Nope! Freddy' s started in Wichita, KS. The burgers are fresh, never frozen and grilled to order. Custard is churned fresh daily at each location. I will try the custard on the next visit!  This visit though, I ordered a \"Chili Cheese Dog\" priced at $3.89 and \"Chili Cheese Fries\" priced at $3.59. The hot dog, all beef, was topped with chili, cheese and onions. I enjoyed it! The chili cheese fries were much bigger then I expected. The fries are shoestring and covered in chili, cheese and onions. I liked that nacho cheese sauce was used and I love shoestring fries, but the fries were soggy from not being hearty enough to hold all of the toppings. I'm a fan of onions rings so I ordered some priced at $2.29 and found them to be pretty good. The onion rings weren't as thick as I would like, but they were big round-wise and cooked just right. Hubby ordered a double \"Hatch Green Chili Burger\" priced at $5.49 and he enjoyed it.   The inside was clean and the employees friendly.",

The burger tasted pretty good. The grilled chilies and onions tasted nice together. My wife had a chili cheese dog and we split an order of chili cheese fries. I took a bite of the chili dog and liked it. The chili cheese fries were just okay, it was more like chili and cheese soup with a few fries floating in it.

The \"dirt' is crushed oreo cookies and the \"worms\" are gummy worms. I was driving and didn't want the mess of a sundae so I chose a concrete. A concrete is a sundae, but blended. For a small, it was a little over $5!! Ouch. I was really disappointed with what I received. There was hardly any \"dirt\", and only a few worms. The custard was vanilla and it was okay.

Looking up reviews prior, it seemed that the hatch green chili burger and the California were the most popular. So I ordered the California as is without onions. California - Tomato, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, double steak patty. The fries were shoe string style and cooked to perfection! A little on the salty side (no need for extra salt seasoning) the steak burger was super flavorful! Melt in your mouth goodness. For dessert we ordered the Concrete (Sundae turned into a shake) vanilla and caramel w/pecans. So delicious!! I'm so happy we don't live in Henderson because I would easily be here once a week. I don't need the extra calories. Haha. Nonetheless we will def be coming back!!",

We finally settled on a regular sundae and a concrete one. When we received our sundaes one of our order was incorrect, the young lady apologized and very quickly was able to make up a new one. The sizes were perfect and flavors were great. Great place for some ice cream your way.

Not at all a good compliment to an otherwise great tasting medley of meat and cheese. I would suggest that you convert the fries to chilli fries. The price is great, fries aside, so I don't feel cheated by the complete lack of effort in the fry department.",

This one is located on eastern in the same parking lot as office depot and krispy cream right in the center.  Can't miss it!  We went the drive thru option and ordered a double cheeseburger and single cheeseburger for me and shared a chili cheese fries.  The man was nice enough to tell us that we could have it with the  mean instead of having 2 fries.  Super fast, super friendly so I'm guessing the other yelpers just got unlucky or was also giving an attitude. As for the food,  OMG super good chili cheese fries with a great portion size.  And they distributed it evenly through the fries.  I hate when people rush and make my food lopsided. The steak burgers was an interesting style since they ate squished flat to cook faster and we order the original not the California style. It didn't taste like those fake McDonald patties which I can't stand.  I'll try it the other way next time.  Overall,  I will return for the chili cheese fries soon.",

I had a mini hot fudge sundae and I believe it came to 3.39 and it was quite enough for me. It was a good size and DELICIOUS !

The fries are thin cut. The appearance of the meal gives Freddy's a unique characteristic to remember it by.  The frozen custards come with a large variety of toppings, which is the main draw. However, if you are just looking for frozen custard and not the burgers, I would recommend venturing down the street to Nielson's for some frozen custard that will make your taste buds explode.",

Freddy's is delicious but the burgers need to be just a bit thicker as sometimes you can see through the meat patties. The flavor is addicting though and their bacon is thick and crispy and tasty. I like the tiny fries but they get cold too quick. The fry sauce and seasoning is a must on the fries. The portion is good for the price. I pay about $7 for a single bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink and sometimes I pay another $.80 to add a green chile. They don't charge extra to grill your onions either. The staff is always very friendly and the service is fast. They will come by and bus your table for you as well.",

Much as I love Fat Boy's pineapple-packing Hawaiian burger, or a good Fatburger on the char (always order on the char), Freddy's hits the sweet spot for me in price, distance, consistency, and drink selection (I like Wild Cherry Pepsi; your own mileage may vary). I can say that some days are better than others, but overall it gets my highest marks. I very much love the maillard crusting along the skirt of the thin double patties; it's good proof that you don't need a flame grill to make a great burger.",

Hot, crispy and I could eat a basket of these alone.  Our order came to just over eleven dollars for the combos and that includes medium refillable drinks.  Had to try the custard, so ordered the turtle sundae.  The small cup looked a little well, small, at the counter but is very adequate.  The turtle comes with caramel, pecans, hot fudge and the richest creamiest custard I've had.    Definitely worth a trip back.  The burgers are good, not great but good.  The custard is outstanding.

Ordered a single to split which is what I do everywhere and the meat was reminiscent of \"where's the beef\"  I could see through the supposed steak burger.  The frys were great and staff was very good and it was clean ant eh milkshake was to die for but to have to order another single to split was something I do not do anywhere else, they need to uses more meat and not require the purchase of a double.  Also MSG sends me up the wall and by 9pm I was UP THE WALL so I am assuming they use a lot.  And with so very many people allergic to nuts and tree nuts why not have a separate area and frying bin for them because it eliminates those people from going there.  If they are that successful that they do not have to worry about the allergens I wish them luck , my daughter is highly allergic to tree nuts and I texted from there to stay away, which means where she cant go I don't go. Amazing, people worry more about gluten than a death causing allergin.  Shame on you.",

Their vanilla custard tastes like McDonald's ice cream. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE McDonald's ice cream, but I think I still prefer Mr. D's frozen custard.

We got my daughter a grilled cheese.  The order came out pretty quick.  The service was great.  the dining room was pretty clean for this place being so packed all the time.  I was bummed out that it was a Pepsi establishment, but that just my individual complaint.  They do have Dr. Pepper though.  Overall the burgers were good.  It didn't blow me away.  I think there are better burger places out there in the same price range.  This is definitely worth checking out for lunch.  The fries did disappoint by themselves.  I ended up eating some of my wife's chili cheese fries.  If you get the fries don't get them without toppings.  Cheers!",

    "text": "my review is more like a 3.5. My attempt to find the best burger in Las Vegas continues. I am still at heart, an in-n-out fan, with Five guys coming in at a close 2nd. Freddy's has only one location in the entire Las Vegas. It just happens to be down the street from my dentist. I got the #7. which is a double steakburger with bacon. unlike Five guys, in-n-out or even smashburger, their burgers are pressed, flattened sort to speak.  It was good, but i prefer my burgers thick and meaty.the flavors were right and overall it was a good burger. The service was fast, the place was really nice. It was busy, i dont know if it is because this was the only location in town, or because the area is just really busy. They serve shoe string fries, really thin, with very light seasoning. different, but good.. but nothing amazing. The highlight was probably  their custard. Again, not too sweet, and they had fry sauce. which was basically a thousand island with a little less zing, not bland, but mild. I would go again, but only if i am on that side of town,  I wouldn't drive that far, for a burger.",

    "text": "I love this place. My girl and I went on a Saturday night and to our surprise the drive thru was empty. I ordered a classic Freddy's double steakburger combo w/fries and a drink, and a pbc frozen custard. My preggo lady had a bowl of chili, a chocolate shake and a large fries( sounds like a pregnant cocktail to me). Came out to $19.30, kinda pricey but it was worth it. Their burgers are juicy and all the toppings including the classic burger bun were fresh to def. they gave us a lot of fries and we both ordered regular size. The fries were probably the best fast food fries I EVER had. Yeah I said the best I EVER had. The frozen custard was great as well, I'm not a big fan of FC but they made it amazing. The PBC had bits of choc. Chips and peanut butter and real banana in it. My girl couldn't eat the chili, it was to much for her, but she said it was great and I agree with what I tasted. Real homemade chili not any processed meat or sauce. I'll be back to Freddy's to try the Cali burger. Also ask for fry sauce, there's is amazing, homemade! And the service was fast and friendly. If You have a love for steakburgers, you will come here. Great place and personally I think in n out has some competition.",

    "text": "First off we were 5 guys fans. Good food but overpriced. Freddys is fantastic. The burgers are very flavorful. Also they do have shoestring fries which are good but wish they were a tad bigger. You get a pile of fries an they are great but they are small. The Fry Sauce is fantastic. It even tastes great on the burgers.  The customer service is great. They come around to all the tables an check on you, take your trash and make sure you dont need anything.  My wifes had the Patty melt and Ive had several different burgers and all have been very good.   Now on to the Dessert. I have had several of the sundaes. All were very good. I am not a huge fan of the concrete as all the flavors are mixed together an find it hard to have the satisfaction of tasting different flavors separate. But it is very tasty nonetheless.  This is a great place to eat.  The food is always hot an very good. The custard is fresh and tasty. Customer service is great. I would definitely tell you to stop by and try some food. Its Good!  The prices are normal for this type of fast food. Comparable to In n Out but less than 5 guys.",
