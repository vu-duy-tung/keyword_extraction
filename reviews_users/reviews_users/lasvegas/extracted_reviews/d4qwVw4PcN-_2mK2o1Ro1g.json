Pink taco is a laid back restaurant (no dress code) showing sports on the flat screens all over.

The complimentary chips and dip were among the best I've ever had.  And out of all the Meximerican we've all had, that's saying something.  The service is hard to overlook in a dinning experience. And the experience here was among the worst.  Despite not being too busy our food took an hour to arrive.  Not cool man.  When it did get there it was on the colder side of lukewarm. If you're in the hard rock check out either places like culinary dropout.  Much better choice",

Not only the food was less than good, the service was horrible.  The guacamole tasted ok, the ceviche was fishy and too sour. We ordered 2 margaritas and a mojito. One of the margaritas wasn't good so my friend returned it. The waitress was slow and never around. We asked her for more chips and she just literally dropped the new basket into the old empty one, also, nobody was clearing the table from dirty plates, when the food runner came to drop our entrees he left me holding the dirty plates! He looked at me holding them with no more room on the table to put them down and just walked away!  At the end of our dinner we asked to talk to a manager, so this woman (manager) comes to our table not being very nice, we told her about everything that happened and she just said, \"ok I'll talk to my staff, thank you\". Well now you see why I'm probably never coming back. Management sucks! And food is not the same anymore, very disappointed.",

Anyways when we finally got seat the food took forever to arrive and wasn't that great just average, the service was extremely slow though I understand it was busy but the waitstaff could have kept on checking back to make sure everything was going fine instead of disappearing until our bill arrived (which we had to wait and ask for).  Btw my boyfriend and I ordered fish tacos, guacamole, and salmon  My boyfriend mentioned the salmon was bland and overcooked while I though the tacos should have been better because the name is Pink Taco in the first place. Guac was the only highlight of our lunch.  Next time I'm in town or staying at the HRH again  I won't be eating here instead going to mr.lucky 24/7 located in the hotel for a better deal and time.",

The house margaritas were not too weak, nor too sweet, and one pitcher ($45) refilled four of us at least once before we ordered another round. Everything that arrived at our table was positively scrumptious- as evidenced by a table-full of plates scraped clean by the meal's end. Before our respective dinners were heartily demolished, they were: fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and veggie burritos adorned with perfectly soft avocado slices.   I would comment on the added delight of the world's best people-watching, especially as more and more patrons cycled in from Rehab throughout the evening, but this is not an honor exclusively reserved for Pink Taco. Acting surprised that any Vegas establishment contains unusual and noteworthy strangers is about as redundant as commenting on the number of Red Sox hats on Yawkey Way.   We also went here for breakfast and sat at the poolside patio to avoid the aggressively chilly AC. The service was a bit slow the second time, but we were still provided with a way to treat our bodies to generous helpings of tasty food before starting to drink in the daytime. Also, the parfait was completely on point.",

Weaker than weak. What a bummer - because you need to get a buzz going to at least tolerate the tacos which were too soggy to stomach (if they were able to make it into the mouth before falling apart into a pathetic pile of questionable ingredients). Flavors were unspectacular and as my father said \"like an expensive version of Chilis.\" Save yourselves the frustration of a costly letdown.",

The food isn't spectacular, but their signature dishes are innovative and good, although a little pricey.  There are certain menu items you can't get anywhere else.    Try the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) which is made with chicken.   You have to order the Pink Taco Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.    Usually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.  For some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.  And it's not because we're in Vegas and we're already having a good time, but the quality of the food and especially the drinks are better.  I know this because I've ordered the same drinks from this location and the one in Hollywood and Vegas wins!  The atmosphere here is fun and the patio is right by the pool.   This place is for lounging: eat, drink, converse and be merry without a sense of time.",

Dinner was awful, house made tortillas weren't even good- they were rubbery and oily. They knew I wasn't happy with my dinner and made no adjustments or efforts. $46 for a crappy dinner for two. On par with the rest of the Hard Rock property. We won't be back. Wish I could make the rating less than 1 star.",

Save your money, try another restaurant at the hard rock.",

The only thing that saved these so called fries was that I used the salsa to cover them. They were in no way shape or form crispy so the salsa did not make them soggy. The salsa was good.",

My gf & I ordered two meals & two margaritas that came up to the total of $45!! REALLY   The margaritas were fruity & not strong at all/food was bland/atmosphere were four dudes drinking at the bar & two other tables with 40 yr olds at them not talking very much   The waitress/staff was cool & explained to me how to \"comp\" my bill since I was staying at HRH other than that my experience there was let's eat this overpriced food & get out of here to go get real drinks.  Food came fast & was hot but totally not worth the price   The chips/salsa were good & tasted really fresh they also gave you three types of salsa to go with it but the salsa wasn't too good either. Maybe it's me but I just don't get this place or the hype   Would I eat here again? NO  Would I drink here again? HECK NO",

I'm lucky enough to have friends that are locals and can share some of their favorite places with me =)   I had dinner here this past Monday...started off the meal with a pitcher of Mango Margaritas (3 people had 2 glasses each). Then we ordered the Sampler platter - one order can easily feed 2 people. It was a great selection of the beef kabob, chicken skewer, tacitos, quesadillas and sweet corn tamales. And let's not forget the Mexican corn...holey moley, guacamole! This corn was OFF THE HOOK! I've never had Mexican corn before...grilled, with a slathering of Mexican cheese, butter and some other creamy concotion...wow...a little salty, but delicious all the same!   While waiting for our food...we snacked on homemade tortillas and a trio of salsas and gazed upon the funky decor of pimped out bicycles and funky art that gave the atmosphere a fun and comfortable vibe.  We finished off the meal with some flan...honestly...I've eaten MANY flans before and I always say that my mom's is better. This was the first time (Honest to God) that I said, it was nearly as good, if not the same, as my mom's recipe. That's telling you right there how authentic this was!   Kudos to Pink Taco!!!!  Another thoroughly enjoyable meal...thank you!!!",

The tortillas were freshly made right when you enter the restaurant, that's what got me to order the tacos. This place is not expensive like most restaurants out here either. They sell pink taco shirts, shorts, tanks, shot glasses etc. I noticed too they have a 2 chair table that has a sign \"worse table to sit at 10%off\" lol its by the kitchen if you sit there you get 10% off your bill.

    "text": "DO NOT GO TO PINK TACO! I filed a formal complaint on behalf of our group of 12 girls, 7 of which got sick with severe food poisoning, including vomiting and diarrhea. The waitress was very nice and gave us great service. Unfortunately, that is where the good service for the restaurant ended. No more than 3 hours later while we were at the Magic Mike show many of us started to feel very ill. Some of us had to leave the show early to go vomit.  The list of items that we ate that night and got sick from were as follows: Shrimp fajitas, gringo tacos, three orders of pink tacos, fish tacos, two orders of steak fajitas, carne asada plate and mushroom tacos. We originally called the restaurant to express our concern for future guests that night and warn the restaurant manager about the high chance of something being served that causes severe food poisoning. Instead of receiving any condolences or expressing concern, we were immediately barraged by questions of whether we could have been sick by other means (ie alcohol) and that the only way to make a confirmed diagnosis would be to go to the ER. We are all trained medical doctors and we explained to the woman the diagnosis procedure for food poisoning. She still did not offer any consideration for future guests and for our own unfortunate dining experience.   Then after filling out the formal complaint to the general manager of the Hard Rock Hotel and emailing multiple times the \"Risk Manager\" we heard no response for days. That is what is prompting this one-star review. Not only was the food not fit for human consumption, the managerial staff of the restaurant and hotel has been completely negligent and refusing to discuss with us any potential refund or apology! So again, there are many other food options in Las Vegas. Do your stomach a favor and CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

We got a pitcher for $48 and let me tell you there is nowhere near enough alcohol for that price. Everything else tasted pretty great. My boyfriend and I shared the gringo tacos which were just traditional crunchy tacos with lettuce, cheese, tomato, and onion. And then we shared the fajitas which had all red peppers which I like since green peppers are normally served and they are pretty irritative on the stomach. Honestly this place is definitely 3 stars to me but the server was nice and attentive enough for how busy she was, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead. Food and drinks are a solid 3 though.",

This time I got the jalapeno popper appetizer.  Filled with cheese, wrapped in bacon, and fried.  Uh, yeah, you can't go wrong with that.  The jalapeno was not too spicy.  Chile Verde - EXCELLENT.  I would recommend getting this.",

We were immediately brought chips and salsa. So delicious! Our server was pretty cool and gave us great service. They have some good lunch specials. If they don't give you a lunch menu, just ask for one. I had the lunch size pink tacos (so good) that came with rice and beans and the husband had a chicken bowl. We both had a house margarita to wash it down with. Excellent margaritas! Don't forget to order the Churros for desert- you won't regret it!",

    "text": "For years, Pink Taco has been one of my go-to happy hour spots, with cheap eats and two-for-one drinks. But when my brother came to town recently, my husband and I decided to splurge and hit the PT for dinner. (It helped that I had $100 comp to use!)  We started with a pitcher of sangria and an order of bacon-wrapped jalapenos. For our entrees, my husband had the carnitas; I had the chopped salad; and my brother had six street tacos (one each of several varieties). The pitcher was pricey at $48, but everything else was $1 off when we used my player's card.  I LOVE that chopped salad, a nice blend of lettuce, turkey, hominy, and pepitas. I always thought they used jicama as well, but when I read the menu more closely, I saw that it was apple. A weird choice, but tasty! My husband loved his carnitas as well. He asked for no cilantro, so they brought his big chunks of pork with onions, tomatoes, and guac on the side. This let him create his own soft tacos with delicious cilantro-free toppings. (There was a LOT of meat there, too, so he had a nice leftover meal.) My brother was not too impressed with his tacos, however. Didn't care for the tortillas (too thick) and was not a fan of the fillings (although he ate all of the fillings and left the tortillas behind).  The salsa, as usual, was pretty bland, and the sangria seemed a lot sweeter than in years past. But my husband and I both enjoyed our food. And the price was right! After using our $100 comp, we owed less than $2 (pre-tip)!  I will still return for happy hour, but it's nice to know that other items on the menu are just as tasty as the cheaper offerings. Just a little more expensive ...",

The three hostesses at the stand were less than friendly, but they seated me right away. 10 minutes later a server finally comes, but she was nice. I ordered a Michelada, and it was GROSS.   My friend showed up so we ordered ceviche and fajitas. The ceviche tasted like the shrimp was already cooked and then mixed in with lime juice, which it's supposed to be cooked BY the lime juice, or something like that. It just didn't taste right. The fajitas were okay, but the tortillas became crispy as soon as they cooled down within a few minutes. I had one and was done.  I switched up my drink for a margarita, and that too didn't taste right. It was sickly sweet. I couldn't even finish my tiny margarita. The bill was almost $100. I'm glad my friend offered to pay or I would've felt extremely cheated and maybe would've given just 1 star.  Definitely NOT my cup of tea.",

There seemed to be no Grand Mariner in the Cadillac mix either.   We ordered their Queso Fundido ($10) which should have been just melted cheese and chorizo (as the menu said) but the dish they served us was mostly some gross enchilada sauce they poured into the dish to dilute the cheese with.

When we arrived they were not prepared for us and we still waited for 5 minutes to be seated, even though they were not busy and most of the tables were empty.   Never received 2nd cocktail that was ordered. They couldn't break up the tickets for our group (less than 12 people) and that created an entire new set of issues when trying to check out. Couldn't see our own tickets to check for accuracy. Basically I ended up doubling the tip without knowing it because I NEVER SAW the actual ticket and didn't realize the gratuity was already added on.   Waitress asked if we wanted both rice and beans and everyone ordered them, however it did NOT come with the tacos so it was actually an extra charge. I have never been to a place where rice and or beans did not come with a taco platter so I was a bit disappointed that we would be offered something that it typical comes with and then charged for it. (And no, I don't know how much they were as I couldn't see my ticket at the register)   The chips that were provided and the chips in the Nachos were the stalest chips I have ever had a restaurant in my entire life. There is honestly NO excuse for stale chips. None. I had fried shrimp tacos and they were OK. Nothing special or memorable and the tamale was the same way.   Side note about the restroom and this does not effect the review (in the hotel - but right by the restaurant). Ladies...beware. There is a reflection on the floor and you can see any neighboring person in their stall via the the reflection on the floor. It was a little shocking to say the least.....

Overall place is alright looking wise and the vibe, its OK! giving this place 3 stars, and i think its plenty.  Btw service wasent the best mainly why 3 stars is what I'm giving.",

    "text": "After checking into the Hard Rock, and making our way to the pool area.  We thought, lets grab a bite, so we made our way back into the Pink Taco.  We waited to get sat in the outside area connected to the pool,  After about 10 minutes we were sat (there were several tables open out there, and I hate when you have to wait to be seated when there are plenty of open tables.)  We decided on the appetizer platter for the two of us, and it had a couple of things to snack on, to hold us over for dinner.  Sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole.    The guacamole was a very small portion.  The cheese quesadillas had NO FLAVOR.  The chicken skewers were over seasoned and dry.  The sweet corn tamales were good, and something I really enjoyed.  The taquitos were ok.  Overall I would say pass on this place after the meal we had.    You get free chips and 3 types of salsa when you get seated, and that was the best part of the meal for both my wife and myself.  The service was OK, but I would never expect that much from a chain place like that.  Overall, I would have rather ate at Taco Bell.  It is way cheaper, and has better overall food, in my opinion.",

Our waitress came by and was different, not sure what was her deal but she couldn't hear anything we said. We ordered a margarita and a mojito. Margarita came and no mojito. Five minutes later she came by and I asked about the mojito. Apparently, she didn't hear my order and didn't apologize just walked away. The wait for the mojito was not worth it, it had Malibu rum in it and tasted like sun tan lotion. My mistake for not reading the ingredients. I ordered ahi tuna tacos, they were great minus the sweet fruit salsa on top. My bf ordered shrimp enchiladas and was brought shrimp tacos, oh well he ate them anyway and they were good. We didn't complain just wanted our check and to go somewhere else without our awkward waitress. If she would of asked if we wanted more to drink, we probably would have but she was too busy getting others orders wrong probably. Food was ok, service not so much.",

    "text": "I recently had my first experience at Pink Taco and I was completely satisfied.  The Mexican-American restaurant is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  The restaurant is within walking distance from the famous Rehab pool and gives you an opportunity to get away from loud party and get a bite to eat.  The dimly lit cantina has a nice Mexican aesthetic to it and is very warm and welcoming.  I needed to get away from the XFANZ Expo and was wanting a bite to eat, so I headed towards the restaurant and bar.  I opted to try an appetizer and I went for the house made guacamole and chips.  I accompanied the guacamole with an ice cold Corona, which only seemed appropriate.  Within a few minutes, my fresh guacamole and chips were delivered.   My initial reaction was that the guacamole was good, but not great.  However, I added a splash of their house salsa into the guac and it really kicked it up a notch and made it much more flavorful and delicious. The three house salsas were mouthwatering and varied from a non-spicy salsa to a lightly spiced salsa and lastly a spicy salsa.  Two Coronas later and the guacamole in my stomach and I was a happy customer.  I highly suggest checking out Pink Taco if you're at the Hard Rock; I'll definitely be back to try other items from their menu.",

The Guac....eh.  We left most of it : (  some sort of weird flavor we couldn't put our finger on.  The Chips are always awesome & they still were.  The salsa was a little different, but still good.  Although, they continue to serve them in tiny ramekins & the only way to have them replenished is by almost tackling a server to get their attention....which sometimes you just don't have the energy to do (sunday morning.....) so you just sit there with empty salsa ramekins....hungry-eyed, hoping they'll bring something else soon.  The Queso dip was the most disappointing thing I've ever tasted : (  It's usually so cheesy, with a bean accent.  this one was mostly bean dip with a lump of non-melted cheese blobbed in the center.  We tried to keep it mixed up, but the cheese kept blobbing with itself and turning hard as it cooled off.  It was just sad, b/c that's the main thing we come for!   .......It was impossible to get the attention of our server so we just ate it as is and felt pouty.  The Chicken Enchiladas w/ green sauce were great as usual - They're definitely a safe bet at Pink Taco.  haven't let me down yet.  All in all, the lacking service along w/ the clumpy cheese dip are reasons I will probably try another Mex restaurant out next time.   I'm sure I'll be back to Pink Taco.... unless I find another place in the meantime.",

Expect a line to get in, it's worth it. Loud rock music of course. Skulls and cherub angels is a bit strange for decor, but the vibe was fun. The service was great with multiple servers taking good care of us. They are serious about their food. This is no Mexican dive. There is indoor/outdoor seating and it borders the pool area. So the food - I had the Pink Taco Combo, which was yummy even though the enchilada was white cheese and I don't know what sauce. The pink taco was delish and yes they really are pink. Someone is making fresh tortillas in the window at the front of the restaurant. They also served a great presentation including a rib kabob thing that i was too full to try. My hubby had the street tacos which was not too much food and very good. Our friend had the chicken fajitas and she thought it was great. I would definitely go back, just park valet. The history of rock museum everywhere in the lobby is very entertaining, especially if you are as old as we are and remember buying the albums and going to concerts back then.",

My favorite item here is definitely the shrimp tacos. Over the years they have scaled back a bit on the quantity of the tacos (which is why I'm only giving 4 stars). 10 years ago, they would serve 4 shrimp tacos along with beans and Spanish rice. About 6 years ago, they scaled the dish back to 3 tacos, which was still enough food, but was a slight disappointment. Now they have scaled down to only 2 tacos on the dish, with the other half of the plate consisting of beans and rice. The tacos are still just as delicious, and the amount of food was just  right to fill you up.  Our waitress, Cristal, was very attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend requesting to be seated in her area.",

It was a warm Sunday evening and since we are both smokers, we opted for patio dining.    The Rehab party was in full swing at the pool, which borders the Pink Taco patio, so conversation at normal decibles was not an option, but the people watching was pretty good.  Lots of hard-bodies strutting their tats and designer sunglasses. But I digress.  Back to the chow ...  I had the carne asada platter and it was good - steak was tender and flavorful. My friend had the carnitas, which was disappointingly dry. The freshly made tortillas were mucho goodo, and the trio of salsas that they deliver with the chips are quite tasty!  The rice and beans were ho-hum, but it is pretty hard to make those jump off of any plate.  Margaritas were yummy, but overpriced, although this IS Vegas and we WERE at the Hard Rock, so it was expected.   Service was average.  I did appreciate the waitress giving me a heads up to check the seat cushion before I sat down, since \"Rehab\"-ers sit on the patio a lot and the cushions can become damp from moist booty.  I will probably return in the future, just because it is one of the few restaurants in town that has outdoor seating where the tobacco-inclined are welcomed.",

As an appetizer we ordered the guacamole with raw veggies, chips and salsa come standard here. And as entree we ordered the veggie fajitas in lettuce cups, prepared vegan. I appreciate that they offer alternatives like veggies to chips and tortilla wraps. Everything came out very quick and hot... and just as ordered. We were both impressed with the speed and accuracy. It tasted flavorful and The veggies all had the right amount of crunch. The entree came with beans and rice. It was definitely enough for two, so be aware of that when ordering. Everything was also extremely fairly priced for being located in a casino... which was also rather surprising.   The service was friendly, quick, and accurate. Make sure to tip accordingly, they work hard and deserve it. I would definitely recommend stopping by here if after the pool... or before a show.",

Not terrible, just not great either. -The seared tuna appetizer came with a sauce that just doesn't go with it. Like ketchup on pizza.  -The Cubana michelada was just all lime. No spice or flavor to it. -The Cadillac margarita was good, standard, but came in a small jar which sucked as other restaurants will serve a bigger size for the same price.  -The asada burrito's meat was crunchy, hard, and even cold. Lacking flavor.  Again, nothing you'll hate, nothing you'll love. No real spice to flavor  to anything. But the place is cool and the staff was nice.",

    "text": "I'm wondering if the restaurant is under new management.  I used to frequent Pink Taco quite often and bring out-of-town guests on occasion as well.  The food used to be much better than it is now, and especially disappointing is the chips and salsa, which I used to order to go because they were so good.  Not any more, they are bland and taste like they came out of a bag.  They used to be really thick and crunchy, and tasted homemade.  Nope.  Also disappointing was the taquito appetizer, which was not worth the price they charge for the portion size.  Overall, I'm disappointed in the decline I've seen since my last visit.  With all of the good restaurants in town, I probably won't be back to the Pink Taco.",

    "text": "Ah, the Pink Taco.  The party doesn't stop just because you want to eat. This Mexican-inspired restaurant / tourist trap with a clever name will do its best to give you a little breather, allow you to refuel and gather yourself and then get you back out into the thick of things.  Among some things that stood out were the margaritas and specialty drinks. Just because you're not out in the party doesn't mean you have to stop the party and these drinks are a good way to keep everything loose. If you're feeling a little wild you can test your luck with the tequila / Mezcal menu.   Beerwise it looks like the venue has a contract with InBev. Besides Budweiser products, Goose Island, Shock Top, Landshark and south of the border beers Corona, Modelo and Dos Equis were available on tap or by bottle.   They do serve food and it's okay. Your standard Mexican-inspired dishes are available and while I will say that my meal didn't knock my socks off, it was filling and did its job. Like I said above, the party doesn't stop and I almost feel like the food is a little bit of an after thought in the restaurant's mission statement, which is a bit disappointing since you're paying Las Vegas prices.  One quick parting thought... this place is really really loud. I sat at the bar and I had to stand on my chair and lean across to order from the bartender. It's definitely part of the atmosphere, but please keep it in mind if you're wanting to talk to who you're dining with.",

The food was neither good nor bad it was just average , I would have done a three star for the food but my main  issue was the service.   Our waitress had a general disinterest in even being around us , I'm really not sure if she may have been having a bad day or what but it seemed it was with all the staff. They were just .....there .....  I asked for napkins 5 times I had to get up and get some from the bar area after I had to get up she finally brought some to the table. She talked over everybody at the table and cut us off which at least at that point we had her attention she spent most the time ignoring us . My best friend asked for hot water for his utensils , she never brought it so he just wiped them down , after we were done eating she said oh I forgot your hot water do you still need it ... no booboo we are done lol.   And we didn't get any refills on our water or soda the whole meal so half my taco was still in the back of my throat after we finished and on my ride home.  I don't think I would recommend-",

    "text": "If you stay at the Hard Rock and don't feel like going far from the hotel I would recommend Pink Taco. In the beginning I thought Pink Taco was a strip club but they actually have a taco served with a pink tortilla. Yes, my mind was in the gutter. I can't help it, I'm in Las Vegas. Anyways, the prices for the tacos are a bit high but it is expected especially in a hotel in Las Vegas. The hostess and waitress were very friendly on our visit. We were seated right away and our waitress took our orders in a timely manner. She also came by frequently to check on our table.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and the queso bean dip which was delicious with the house tortilla chips. The tacos were a bit small but did taste fresh. If you glance over by the front entrance you can see one of the staffs preparing fresh tortillas. The average price per meal with a beverage is around $25-$30. We were pretty pleased with the experience and we actually came back a second night. I should've stuck with the tacos but instead I ventured out and ordered the tamales. The sauce on it was very salty. The side of rice and beans wasn't that impressive either.   The restaurant is worth trying if you're staying at the Hard Rock or if you're near by. I can't say it is a restaurant that I will go out of my way to try out.",

Why would you advertise inside the hotel by the guest elevator only to deny guests the same access as \"locals\".   Considering it is advertised on a Tuesday - being off peak for Vegas and the hotel has such limited dining options already, this should be an incentive offered to IN HOUSE guests for staying mid week.  Bad marketing management by pink taco and the hotel for allowing this practise.  I feel this is discriminatory practise by both restaurant and hotel.",

    "text": "This place has some pretty good Mexican food. They have a wide variety of tacos, enchiladas, soups and entrees. We were in the restaurant for about 15 minutes before seated and this was around 8 PM. Probably not the best time to have dinner since a bunch of large groups were coming in before their night out. Considering the larger parties at that time, we were seated pretty quickly.   When we got to our seat, just like other reviews, we too were not approached by a server until 10 minutes of sitting (could have been longer!) That's a long time when you're hungry. Even though it was our first impression of our server we gave her the benefit of the doubt. After she takes our drink order our free chips and salsa arrive. So delicious and the salsa was bomb!   Ok so after our chips and salsa arrived she brings us a round of waters and then a party of 8 gets sat right next to us. Honestly it was probably another 10 minutes until our main drinks came back to our table. She obviously saw this party when she dropped off our waters and she still hadn't approached her new table. Look, I used to be a server and I know how to manage my time wisely. It's obvious she was not doing that. I started to keep a close eye on her. She had one more table that we saw her taking care of who already had their food down.  I did see her across the bar a few times gossiping to another server/employee. Apparently this employee is more important than the people she is supposed to be attentive to.   Idk what she did, but she disappeared in the back somewhere and then some time later she finally came back to take our order. I would totally understand if she came back out with some food or possibly helping out another server but no!  she took our order and then greeted her new party of 8. Not only did we get delayed service but so did this other party which could have easily been avoided by not gossiping on the clock.   Whatever, anyways.. food was great but this place could improve on their hospitality.",

Glowing tequila bottles, hand-painted skull murals, Mexican folk art, vintage low-rider bikes and hanging star lamps are just a few of the eclectic design accents at Pink Taco. There's a nice selection of margaritas, mojitos and speciality cocktails, which you can order by the glass or pitcher.   We ordered the namesake pink tacos, shrimp tacos, fried ice cream dessert and some mint mojitos. The standouts were the fried ice cream and the pink tacos. One of our servers claimed the fried ice cream was one of the best fried ice creams out there. She was right--it definitely something memorable. A large scoop of vanilla ice cream cloaked with crushed Frosted Flakes and then deep fried to a golden brown finish. It is then drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces and laid in a fried tortilla shell. The pink tacos are a fun selection. These pink-hued handmade tortillas are stuffed with grilled chicken, pickled pink onions, black beans, salsa and fresh avocado slices. The perfect Rehab diet food. I wasn't too keen on the side of rice. I love fresh and fluffy Spanish rice and there's tasted like something straight from a box. All and all, a solid plate.   In the warmer months you can relax on their outdoor patio, which looks out onto the famous Hard Rock pool.   Pink Taco is a fun Vegas hotspot. Come for the creative drinks, funky decor and plenty of eye candy.",

As I'm not a fan of tortillas, I only tasted it and thought it was as bland and tasteless as can be.   Ceviche - dry, overly acidic, bland. Tasted like old fish. Cutting back on the lime juice on this item would do it some good.   Baja fish tacos - once again, way to go Pink Tacos. You're awesome at serving smelly dry tasting fish.   The only good item throughout the whole night was the guacamole.   Don't waste your money eating here.",

    "text": "So I bet your thinking \"What is different about Pink Taco from all of the other great Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas you have to choose from\"? EVERYTHING! The margaritas, ceviche, nachos, dessert and the amazing service all play a role in what sets it apart from everyone else!   Located inside The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Pink Taco offers some of the best margaritas! My favorite is called the Kinky Bitch Margarita. It's Patron Silver, Kinky Liqueur, with hints of lime juice and sweet and sour. The first sip I took I thought to myself \"Pitcher Please\"!   Make sure to start with an appetizer called the Ceviche Duo. You get two different types of ceviche: One with shrimp and one with fresh red snapper. I liked the red snapper ceviche a little more than the shrimp ceviche because it was different and had a little bit of a different taste than the shrimp. Both were delicious and you got big portions of each.   For dinner I mean you really can't go wrong with their Steak Nachos! They I include chipotle queso, frijoles roasted peppers, and are topped with a cilantro & avocado crema! Hello party on your mouth! Super tasty and you get enough to feed any army!   Not if but WHEN you order dessert (because who really questions if they should get dessert or not) you have to order the Molcajete (Mega Sampler). It's made of warm molten chocolate cake with fried ice cream, chocolate or caramel filled churros, sopapillas honey and ancho raspberry sauces. You got the best of all dessert worlds rolled into one dish! And again they were more than generous with their dessert portion as well!   One thing I can't forget to mention is the quality of  service! Our drinks were never empty and the food was delivered quick! If you get a chance to visit the bar make sure to ask for my favorite bartender Jessica! She will take good care of you! She makes the best Margarita's in town!

    "text": "okay this place is called pink tacos, if you were expecting authentic you must be trippin'.  PINK TACOS.. PINK FREAKIN TACOS.. TACOS OF PINK COLOR.. What part of that makes you think, ooooh authentic mexican flare? UHH nothing...   It's a large restaurant located in the hard rock that has decent tasting food.  I ordered the pink tacos, after all you always eat something they name the restaurant after right?? To be honest they weren't half bad.. Had a nice flavor, far from authentic, but certainly edible. :)  Servers were on it and my friend said his margarita was DELISH!  Let's be real, i wasn't about to start my drinking at 11 am when i stayed up till 5 am the night before.. NOT HAPPENING!!!  The best part of this place is the massive amounts of chips and salsa.. I gnoshed on that all throughout the meal..   This may be the perfect spot when they open up the deck to the pool area.  I can see this place bustling during the spring and summer just because theres a bar and food right by the pool..   For gosh sake, this place is called pink taco, for that reason alone you should give it a shot. Just don't expect truly authentic mexican food.. Jus' sayin'.

That is the #1 reason why I always try to grab a meal here while in Vegas.   This trip around I was in town for a staff retreat and our group would be anywhere from 8 to 16 people. Instead of making a reservation through their corporate dining contact I just set up 2 separate 8 person reservations via OpenTable. (Good tip for anyone in the same situation)  When I was the first person to arrive and explained to the hostess that we only needed 1 reservation of 10 she easily deleted the outstanding reservations and quickly had us seated in an appropriate sized table.  How nice not to be waiting forever and how efficient for the hostess ladies to just roll with our request instead of making a big deal out of it. The women all working the hostess desk were phenomenal and instantly I knew our visit would be a great one.   We were sat and service was extremely quick.  Our waitress--whose name I did not get unfortunately--was friendly and personable. Drinks came quickly and so did our food. Everyone loved their meal and we all left full and satisfied.   PT has a great atmosphere, is not too pricey and has a great cocktail menu.  The food is tasty and the fact that it is set inside such a great, party place like Hard Rock is a huge plus.  I look forward to coming back on my next trip.",

But we had awesome service from our waitress, Lahaina. She was able to answer questions about the menu and was very attentive.   The best part about PT are the drinks.

Sounds good right???? it was OK, carne asada fries shoild never and I mean NEVER be made w/ potato wedges - Knock it off  Sangria: to me, very water down  Chip & Salas: subpar salsa, and stale chips  Super OVERpriced for mediocre food, and that's me being nice about it.

For me I've been here twice now and I really just feel like this place is a sorry excuse for Mexican food! It has no flavor and the tacos are bland as all hell. Want to talk about inflation of price? I clearly don't mind paying for what I get and of course things will be over expensive in a casino restaurant but you are almost at like $20 for 3 small tacos.. The nachos are probably the best thing on the menu. I just recently was here and ordered the burrito meal which comes with black beans and again for $15 this burrito should be much more tasteful! I could go get two carne asada burritos from Roberto's or 2 bigger burritos from chipotle for the price and have it to much well worth it!",

However, because of all the Mexican food I've eaten since being in LA, I'm feeling more and more confident about my ability to judge the cuisine.  For a chain, this place is not half bad. I had the carne asada taco plate with comes with rice and beans. I have to say, I enjoyed the tacos. The meat was flavored well and topped with some nice pico de gallo. The rice and beans were another matter. The beans were downright gross and obviously mushed up canned beans. Blech. No thanks. The rice was also dry and bland. I'd stick to just eating the tacos.   Another good thing? The drinks. Lots and lots of options and they do have a particularly delicious selection of margaritas.   The bad thing? The prices. They are ridiculously overpriced for Mexican food. My taco plate was like $13 for three tacos and crap beans and rice. There is barely anything that costs less than that and nothing is that good that it's worth paying more.   My advice? Drink the beer, drink the margaritas, and maybe have an appetizer but otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere (perhaps on a \"Pink Taco\" t-shirt that you can giggle at? Ha...)",

It was near the end of the service and they happily served us, w/o rush or attitude. That's always much appreciated. We got our food and drink quickly but were not rushed.   The food itself wasn't great. We just wanted a nibble so the 3 of us ordered the appetizer platter. It came with chicken skewers, beef skewers, sweet corn tamales, taquitos, and quesadilla w/ guacamole. The sweet corn tamales are good is you like that sort of thing but have a bit too much of a vanilla flavor. The skewers had decent flavor, but I was not a fan of the texture of the meats, as both were a bit dry. The taquitos are cheese and were ok. The quesadilla was really good actually with a bit of smokey flavor and seemed to be a bit more then just cheddar and/or monterey jack. The chips and salsas are good and  plentiful. The sangria wasn't strong but tasted yummy and was really refreshing after the long hot concert.",

Pink Taco, however, lived up to the hype in my head.  Salient pink and funky decor set the vibe in this place. The three salsas that come with your chips slap you silly as you decide what to order. The taco menu is what I came for. I was happy to see some variety. I ended up going for the fish tacos. I asked for no rice and beans and our server offered to substitute vegetables. A kind gesture--but they were a little greasy and odd tasting. Upset stomach problems were imminent.  The fish tacos are a subtle masterpiece. Nothing about the description prepared me for their goodness. I was expecting a disappointment. The place was too cool, the salsa too good, but every dog has his day. I think it's Pink's serrano-cilantro sauce that helps make this an outstanding taco. The batter on the fish is also quite tasty. I wanted to slap the chef the tacos were so good.   Thus far I've only found one other fish taco worth jabbering about on my taco journey and this one has supplanted Berryhill's in Houston's fish taco. In fact, it has buried it.",

I would give it 2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since the guac was spot on. The chips were good, and the tortillas are made in house. But everything went downhill from there. We ordered the fajitas, and they were a serious disappointment. Still trying to figure out why my chicken came out so greasy and red? And I also didn't get the beans. Were they aiming for the refried taste? I won't be back. The name of the restaurant is more appealing than the food.",

I would've been better off going to a local joint such as Fausto's for a more authentic dish and for a great price.  I had a chicken dish with chimchurri sauce. It was supposed to be the best  pick off the menu. The chicken beaten to a thin strip was ok. The rice was stale. The salsa was a bit too salty if you can believe.  This place may be better if you're drunk and don;t notice the taste is the bottom line.",

We arrived at 10:58 to find unlocked doors and staff walking around inside. We believed that it was open so we entered. After standing inside waiting to be seated, an employee and supervisor came in from the outside and rudely asked us to leave. I would have no problem with this if they used at least some sort of common respect and tact while asking us to get out 2 minutes before they opened.  The server on the other hand was very helpful and displayed sincere professionalism. The food was pretty good and came in amounts that matched the price - something rare in Vegas. I had the carne asada and was very pleased with it. My girlfriend had a chicken quesadilla and let me tell you, it was STUFFED with chicken. Pretty good. My other 3 friends were content with their meals as well.  An overall good experience with the exception of those two staff members. Maybe it's just me, but as a customer who is about to spend my hard earned money on a meal I expect some form of respect or at the very least common politeness.  If you're staying at the Hard Rock stop by, if not it's nothing special so I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

They offer these three salsas with the chips you get when you sit down and my wife and I used to destroy them all. The last time we went in (about a month ago) was because my wife was jonesin' for some good chips and salsa and we couldn't be more disappointed. The salsas were bland, watery and lacked any unique taste. We asked the server and she said about six or seven months ago that they changed the recipe. I've always been a fan of the sabano de pollo. It was extremely rich but extremely juicy and flavorful. I used to think this is how a fat kid with a cake on his birthday feels. It was good this time around, and it may have been as good as in times past but I just couldn't get over the betrayal of the cheapening of the ingredients.  House margaritas are solid, and service is good.",

Last September the service was awful and the food wasn't even something we finished because it was so bad. We decided to give it another shot last night. Carlos, our server, took a ridiculous amount of time to so much as acknowledge us. We're a very, very easy going, happy friendly, high tipping party of 3, and didn't expect much, but to be ignored wasn't prime. Finally almost an hour later, our food shows up. The others food was \"edible\" as they said, and mine was flat out wrong.  I'd have sent it back, but Carlos failed to ever return.  I scraped out a few bites of whatever it was they brought me.  The $60 bill was dropped off at the table and suddenly Carlos was ready to help us....help us get out the door.  Taking with other hotel guests about our experience, sounds like this is common practice.   I gave Pink Taco another shot because of how well LA does....I will absolutely never return again.",

(never again) I was told this place would be \"really tasty\", and I have to say it was a little bit of a let down. Really, really average \"mexican\" food at best. I think I had some sort of lackluster enchilada plate with a creamy cilantro sauce. (the sauce was actually pretty good) Also, I remember having corn on the cob and it being DELICIOUS--it had some sort of garlic/mayo coating on it--sounds gross, but I assure you it wasn't! (NO idea why they served corn on the cob, btw) Honestly, this place earns 3 stars solely for the deelish corn and the margaritas.

My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Vegas where we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel (our first mistake) and of course wanted to try the infamous Pink Taco. The concept of the Pink Taco is fun and amusing but I couldn't get over how salty the beans and rice were! I ordered the carnitas tacos were decent but the beans and rice were disgusting! How do you screw up something so simple?? Chips and Salsa were pretty tasty. The house margarita that our water suggested wasn't as good as I had hoped and didn't even give me a buzz leading me to believe that there wasn't enough alcohol in it. Our server was very friendly and fast so that made the experience a decent one but I just couldn't get over the salt factor to give the Pink Taco a better rating. I did however indulge in a pair of Pink Taco boy shorts...as I could not resist. : )  Check it out if you must but if you forget to stop by you are not missing much.",

Service is very good, and the food is fabulous for such reasonable prices.  One bit of advice, if  you sit outside, they have some overhead heaters that radiate warm heat downwards.  Maybe it's okay on a super cold day, but I didn't like it.  Not all the tables have the heater, just ask to be moved if it bothers you (which they did no problem).  They also have some nice souveniers at the entrance.",

Chips were ok, but only one of the three salsas they brought was tasty.  It seemed like they were trying to be original with their unique salsas, but something just went wrong and they weren't good.  I had the Baja fish tacos, which were the worst I've ever had.  The fish was ok, but bland.  The tortillas were pasty, like they were undercooked.  The rice could have been Rice-a-Roni, but it wasn't even that good.  The beans were the one thing I ate most of.  My friend had fajitas, and the meat was tough.  They brought her tortillas wrapped up in a cloth napkin, that kept them warm for about two minutes.  All that combined with weird lighting, which gave the place a cool atmosphere but made the food look even less appetizing (a green light right above the table?) just made the entire experience bad.  I won't try this place again.",

Convienance is #1 especially after the concert was over. We both had way too many drinks at the show and were starving. So we guided by the crowd into the PT and found 2 open seats at the bar. I had water since for the last 3 hours, I was fighting to keep my drink down. I normally don't drink that much at concerts for fear of fumbling my lunch. So we order green chicken enchilada's and 7ups. These were the best I ever had. No Joke. My Abuelita was replaced in about 45 minutes of feasting on these bad boys. Beans and rice was as authentic as I ever had in East LA or at home. Sure, I was drunk off my ass but the favor was on! Mucho Saludos a los cocineros. There may be better \"Mexican\" food places, but if your catching a show at the Hard Rock. Stop by and have a plate of \"the best I ever had\" green chicken enchilladas. Next time, we are staying at the HRC since we stayed at MGM. That was a long ass walk but the things you do when you got \"LONG ISLAND ICED TEA BALLS\". If you don't agree, I will meet you at the 10fry & Soto St and throw down for my honor! hahahha Keep on yelping.",

Our waitress (who finally decided to bless us with her presence) explained that happy hour was 2 for 1 drinks.  Great, the wife and I said, and we ordered 2 margaritas.  She shows up with 4.  What's this, I asked.  It's 2 for 1, she explains, you order 1 and we bring you 2.  If I wanted 2 each I would have fucking asked for FOUR!!!  When I told her I didn't want 2 each she looked so put off (is this REALLY the first time this has ever come up sweetheart?!?) but did take away the extra 2 margaritas.  We had a few more beers and a lackluster appetizer sampler and bounced. Fuck the Pink Taco.",

The pickled onions were plentiful on the tacos which I wasn't crazy about. I think I would only go back for their happy hour which is only on weekdays. The cheapest margarita pitcher was really good. The chips and salsa were soo good. My friend got the shrimp tacos which she said was amazing. The prices are not cheap by any means but its vegas hello. The rice and beans were only ok which I am glad I stuffed myself on chips. The other girls liked their tacos but 12 bucks for three small tacos is a bit disappointing.  Our server Erin was on top of everything she was cool honest and helpful.",

Apparently the hotel and restaurant were sold and you can tell the new owners really couldn't care about quality and service anymore.  What used to be a hopping, full-of-fun and life restaurant is merely a shell of its former self.   Food - if one could call it that - was awful. Stale, dry meat as part of the tacos and burritos. Rice and beans were like straight out of the can. All in all, it was pretty much disgusting.  Service? Well, our waitress did try. I think she was happy that we were drowning our hunger in booze.",

The food is pretty good for out of California Mexican food....I like the chicken tostada salad, it would be better if it was steak...but, we can't have everything we want... They freshly make their tortillas, which I guess is pretty standard now, but still a plus in my mind.  The one really unique thing is the tequila pina colada....it was pretty good, and if you are doing tequila shots, being able to order a frozen drinks without mixing rum and tequila is amazing.",

Haven't been to HR in several months - a frickin' nightmare trying to figure out where to park ( finally opted for valet )  after a few hours of craps and poker ( wtf is the deal with paying a $1 to change out one of your hole cards ?!?! ), we opt on some din-din at Pink Taco.  I seem to recall eating at a pink taco in Scottsdale, i assume related.  order a hornitos margie on the rocks ( $9.50 ) carnitas platter ( i believe $15 ) guacamole ($7 ).  roomie gets the shrimp taco platter $12.75  the chips with the 2 salsas - decent.  the guac - ehhh, a little strong on onion but ok.  The carnitas were good - i prefer carnitas that is simply the salty  roasted pork  variety with no sauce and then i'll add the salsa when i rolled it up in the tortilla.  this had a sauce and the pork was in chunks as opposed to shredded.  it was still tasty.  the shrimp tacos - very average.  coated shrimp, a little too greasy.  overall, i liked the place.  if i'm in the HR and want a quick bite, this place is worth a visit.  total bill ( incl 2 margies and a virgin strawberry daiquiri for the roomie )   $61",

I'm really picky about nachos and these werent alllll that only because I don't like smoky meat flavor in my nachos but my bf devoured them! The tamales on the other hand were the BOMB! Its rare to get good sweet tamales and I grew up eating these things. I also rarely eat sweet tamales because I never like them! So I'm actually surprised at how much I loved them.  The combination of the tamale with sour cream and salsa was perfect. Luckily I found out there is a Pink Taco in L.A so I will be visiting this place for my little  fix of sweet corn tamale.",

What is weird is that the food is really reasonably priced, but the drinks are some of the most expensive I have ever seen.  Our food bill was well below our drink bill, and all we ordered was a pitcher of sangria. The highlights were the salsas that came with the chips.  My husband said the roasted tomato salsa was the best he's had.

I split the sweet corn tamales as an app as well, which were incredible. The fresh sweet corn kernels were outstanding and the masa was good.   I was torn as to what I should order. I was feeling like something flavorful but not spicy, which isn't what I normally go for (the not spicy part). So, I ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas with a tomatillo cream sauce (served with rice and beans). The beans were smokey and not my favorite, but the rice hit the spot as did the enchiladas. The sauce really made the dish for me...I can't pass up tomatillo sauce.   Our service was quick and so was our food. Our table of seven sat, served and ate in just over an hour. Granted, we were there on a Wednesday night in January, but I would definitely go back again.",

The waitress are friendly, they just need more people to serve their customers.",

    "text": "And to think I was pretty excited to go here. So many dining choices and we drive off the strip to come here. At least it wasn't full at all, really thought there would be a wait, but we were there pretty early for dinner. Happy hour only at the bar which we could not sit at with a kid, so we were off to paying double as everyone else there as we were the only ones at a table, they could have really made an exception. Tried to talk my husband into ordering the 3 lb $25 burrito, he went with the $18 regular instead. I had the fish tacos ($14), my son the quesadilla ($11) The prices are INSANE for what you get! The $18 burrito smaller than any other that you can get for a third that price, grizzly meat, served with black beans and salad, not rice and refried as stated in the menu. Unhappy camper. The quesadilla a sorry presentation, very lackluster in taste, $11 they should really be ashamed!!!!! Just cheese, no sides, no garnish, I was pissed! My fishtacos, 2 for $14 were ok, the second time. FIrst time they brought  me cold fried fish on corn shells when I ordered grilled on flour. Servers mistake, he brought someone else's plate that had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile. By the time my order came out the guys were done eating, so they sat and stared while I ate,  not fun. Fish tacos were fine, not stellar, neither was rice and beans. $60 for something I would have paid around $10 for in SoCal and didn't even taste good, very disappointed Pink Taco!",

I may find something else while there that I develop a strong connection too (LOL) but, I  have found nothing, as of yet, that could take the place of that guacamole! It's always the main dish for me. It is the best guacamole that I've ever had! Tonight, I tried their signature..and very literal...PINK Street Tacos! They're actually pink. Haha. And they were delicious!! My drink of choice was their \"Panty Dropper\" Martini with raspberries, peaches and cotton candy. I must say, it was fricken delicious. They have so many different choices when it comes to their cocktails. I seriously can not wait to go back and try them all. If you guys haven't been to the Pink Taco inside The Hard Rock, and haven't tried their crazy drinks or their delicious guacamole, y'all are missin' out!! It is definitely not to be missed. For me, is was another successful trip to The Pink Taco!!",

    "text": "This review is for their weekend brunch menu.  The Skinny: although there is large variety of dishes (we tried alot of them), there were only 2 dishes I thought I would ever want again (2.5) service: prompt/friendly and helpful(4) value: love the brunch tapas concept and the service - if only the food was as good (3).  We were intrigued by the new brunch being offered by Pink Taco so we decided to hit the joint with 2 pals in tow. For $24.99 you can order anything food item off their brunch menu and it comes to the table, tapas style. The whole table must get this because of the way they serve their brunch. The food is cooked a la minute which is great - no brunch items underneath heating lamps and warmed trays! Drinks are not included in this price. They do have all-you-can-drink specials of bottomless mimosa or \"donkey punch\" for $9.99.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was helpful in suggesting which dishes to try. As we were waiting for the last of our party to come, they brought out a nice little bread basket with warm fry bread in it and a small bowl of fruit sprinkled with coconut.  It is hard to give a full description of all the food we ordered because we tried at least 15 small plates amongst the four of us. To be honest, I would not order the majority of the things we tried again.  The highlights:  Cold dishes The ceviche was rather bland and the seafood was texturally tough. The tequila salmon gravlax was cut very thickly (again bland) and served with tortilla chips which didn't really make sense to me.  Hot dishes The mushroom churros did not taste at all like mushrooms - if you approached it as a plan ol' churro, it tasted okay. The spiced maple pork belly was a little too fatty  but tasted alright. The lobster quesadilla was really skimpy on the lobster and was bland. Chicken and waffles were texturally soggy and not good at all. The blue corn pancakes were really ho-hum. Bacon jalapenos were okay. The chicken tortas were underseasoned. Sweet corn tamales were too firm for my tastes although it tasted fine. Angry dogs were not so angry - the bread was too firm and the chorizo was relatively boring. Signature pink taco was okay but nothing to  call home about. The carnitas hash was okay but nothing special.  The best two dishes were the carne asadas and the plantain french toast. The carne asadas were nice and tender while the plantain/coconut hash really complimented the dish. The plantain french toast was really wonderful - loved the softness of the bread with the crispy surface.  The ingredients/presentation of our dishes were good - if only the execution matched it. If I were to go again, I would probably save myself some money and stick to the carne asadas or the french toast. I definitely do not feel the need to do the $24.99 brunch menu special again. It's with a heavy heart I give this joint a 3-starred review.",

I got there around 3, was seated wayyyyy in the back of a virtually empty restaurant, a lady took my drink order & brought it over, another guy brought chips & said a server would be with me shortly, but now my neck hurts from looking all over the place for said server.  Happy hour started at 4, and at 3:45, my food order had STILL not been taken, so I moved to the bar to take advantage of the specials and possibly get someone's attention. If I hadn't been waiting for another person the whole time, I would've waltzed right on out. Nothing worse than inattentive staff when a joint is slow. Moral of the story: Check on your customers frequently. Most of them are pretty hungry if they've walked into your restaurant.  The hot pink margarita was just as wonderful as I expected from my last time having it at a Magic Mike event, and the food was also pretty decent when it finally came. Shame that I more than likely won't be back due to the lackluster service flow. Pink Taco is in a casino, so inflation is a thing, but for close to $40 on okay \"mexican\", I'm not interested in being ignored in a corner ever again.",

The hostess told me it would be about 20 mins...but quickly returned about 5 mins later telling me the food was ready. I could tell by the smell emanating from the bag that this wasn't going to be great, but I was tired so I headed back to my room.  As suspected, the tacos were old. Not sure if they had accidentally prepped them for another order and left them out or what. The fish was cold to the touch, which probably wasn't safe to eat. As I said, I was tired, so they ended up in the trash - not worth the walk back down there. The black beans and rice were hot and decent. I definitely won't be back when I return for work next week.",

I saw the sign for Pink Taco and I was totally sold as I love the Los Angeles location. It wasn't crazy busy so we were easily seated and our waitress sorted our food out pretty quickly. I ordered the Guacamole, a Wet Steak Burrito and also one of their Jalapeno cocktails. The guac was tasty but I was mildly disappointed with my burrito, it seemed to lack the flavour of the ones I've had at the Los Angeles location. My cocktail was super tasty and very strong so it lasted me a while.  Definitely enjoyed the meal but probably wouldn't order the burrito again, I'll explore the menu a little next time.",

Needless to say, we enjoyed the atmosphere and all of the funny merchandise they have for sale.  My girlfriend got a very reasonably pried shot glass.  Our meal was very nice and our server, Carrie, was great, too. My girlfriend had the famous pink taco (what else) and I had three tacos-- the fish, carne aside, and chicken.  They were all good, but the carne asada was the winner. Nice and juicy.  Everything was very filling and I chowed down on the free chips, too.  I found the salsa to be too spicy, which is why I took a star off.   This is a very relaxed and tasty option for a quick meal in Vegas.  We were in and out in 30-45 min on a Sunday afternoon.  Pink Taco also has a happy hour and if you sit at the worst table near the kitchen, you get 10% off your food. Funny!   Estos tacos son muy delicioso (I think that's pretty good Spanish, my professor would be horrified).",

I had already had a few drinks so it didn't occur to me that a person who worked at the hotel might be biased opinion towards the hotels restaurant. Naturally I went to the Pink Taco with high hopes.  I had the taco sampler. It consisted of three tacos that you got to pick. I chose 3 different and wasn't really impressed with any of them. They weren't terrible but they really weren't good at all. First of they were almost cold. It felt like the meat had been prepared hours ago. The thing that bothered me most was that the corn tortillas were so thick they overwhelmed the flavor to the point you really felt like that was all you were eating.   The set up and decor was nice. I liked the feel of the patio despite being sat at a table that leaned harder than me at 3am after 3 of those tall icy alcoholic drinks. The service was also pretty good but at the end of the day I couldn't get past me that taste of the bland, almost cold tacos. It shouldn't be tough to get those right and for that I can only give 2 stars.",

The chips n' salsa weren't bad at all, nothing special (again this review is coming from someone who KNOWS good Mexican food, but hey its all opinion right?) but they did give you three salsas to dip from.  We had chicken quesadillas as an appetizer (you have to be a moron to screw up heating two flour tortillas together with cheese and chicken, luckily they weren't).  These were good and I have no complaints.  For dinner I ordered the Mojado Burrito.  The waiter told me this was the most food I could get (hey, I'm 6'7'' and I was dang hungry aight?).  It was smothered in some sort of red sauce.  You could order the burrito with chicken, steak, carnitas (pork), or vegetarian.  I ordered it with pork and my friend ordered it with chicken.  The burrito was very tasty, I ate every last bight.  Overall the food was pretty tasty and actually better than what I expected, the three stars was for the service.  Our waiter was awful.  Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal.  Looking around the restaurant I noticed the same thing.  \"I'll be right back with some more water\" means \"Hey, I'm going to go chill in the corner for 10 minutes and then remember to give you a refill.\"  Most people have given this place 4 stars for the food, you have to remember I'm a New Mexican and I know good Mexican food when I taste it =).    Prices were about $10-15 per plate.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock Casino I would definitely go give this place a try.  This place was a little noisy though and I found it hard to hear my friend talking to me, other than that go get your fix of some pink taco!",

If you're recovering all day from the night before and you're finally able to hold down food, but all of a sudden you can't because your fish tacos taste like someone walked around with them balled up in their fist outside in the Vegas sun for an hour, you'd be disappointed too.  From other reviews it sounds like they have a lot of other good food on the menu and I'm sure they do but I won't be wasting my money on their fish tacos again.  They were bland and soggy, two things fish tacos should never be.

There I said it... coagulated. not good texture for melty cheese!  The food came out and it was so flavorful and good that I almost made myself SICK eating .   Definitely want to go back -",

    "text": "I don't like pink tacos, but I do like Pink Taco. Sure it's a little cheesy and the initial draw is the borderline inappropriate name of the restaurant, but you'll be surprised to find that the food and drinks here are legitimately good and strong. Big margaritas and delicious carnitas plus a comfortable dining atmosphere and nice servers. To top it all off, the prices don't make you want to head immediately to the casino afterwards to win it all back.  Sadly, yes, there is now more than one. However this location is better to go to than the LA one. Strangely, this one is less flashy and I think the food and service is better, no slashies (waiter/model/actor/singer) 'serving' you. Been here with both the bf and also with my fam - it's appropriate in both instances. Only downside is it's so far off the strip. I'd recommend going here after shopping at the mall/outlets or maybe before or after a day at Rehab.",

This time we were pleasantly surprised by our attentive and professional server, Dena (sp) and the food to be very good. I would even considering staying here on our next visit based on our positive meal.   I ordered the chicken tostada salad which was flavorful and well prepared. The portion was extremely large and could have been shared. My son ordered a specialty burrito which was equally large and tasty. We were there during happy hour and ate at the bar and enjoyed 2 for 1 beers. So our meal was also a great value.",

The people who worked here were friendly, it wasn't too busy, prices were reasonable (especially for Vegas), and the food was okay.'  As soon as we sat down we were serves chips and three different types of salsa which were all surprisingly good. I ordered the house margarita which was delish and we got an appetizer sampler to split between three girls. The server was also nice enough to inform us that for $2 or $3 more we can get three of each of the appetizers, instead of two of each on our sampler, so that all of us can have one of each appetizer. The appetizer was okay though, nothing too special, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a hotel restaurant.  Service was good, our server was very friendly and informative, but I was really peeved that I had to ask for a water refill (TWICE). It was a Sunday afternoon in Vegas. Hellooooo, I'm obviously hungover and in desperate need of water.",

She took forever to get the order, i know I was waiting on my friend but I told her I would like to order please :)  Then I got no water, even after I asked for it, twice.  Mind you, she did not have many tables to serve. If you like Sangria and you had REAL one before, DO NOT order this one. Its unfortuantely really yucky. The retirementhome waitress took it back, which was nice. The frozen margarita tasted as any other typical frozen machine crappy one they serve tourists that dont know better.

Another great thing is the chips and the three different kinds of salsas which I could eat by itself.   Only thing that sucked was the kids cup sized margarita for $10.00. I was like \"come on\"-- \"Seriously.\" If you get a choice sit outside it was nice.   P.s. Guacamole is not chunky but had alot of onion in it which I think is good.",

It comes with three different salsa options and the tortilla chips are made fresh. For an app, the sweet corn tamales are amazing, I absolutely love the chicken tostada salad and get it every time. Also greatly recommend the drinks, the pina colada is my favorite.  Service has always been great, all the staff is very friendly. Ambiance is nice with fun decor. Definitely a little loud though but it's a great place for happy hour and catching a football game.  The only downside is there is always a line out the door, and I don't think you can make reservations. So get there early!",

I used to come here often, because I was so lucky to live 2 mins away.  They  have OK drinks, that is why they don't get 5 stars. I had a bloody mary here, and although I enjoyed it, it could have been way better! Advice: stronger and less diluted please!

    "text": "I liked this place so much, I ate here twice during my stay.   Meal #1: pink taco plate. This was really good. I wish I could remember what was in it, though. Honestly, someone just said I should order it, so I did. It comes with 3 tacos, which are a bit like glorified street tacos. I want to say they were chicken. A special sauce may or may not have been involved, but if it was I didn't notice and I normally dislike copious amounts of any sauce. I like that they give you 3 good-sized tacos. Those, with your typical rice & beans, managed to fill me up.   Meal #2: 1/2 chicken in a mole sauce. One thing I love about getting a 1/2 chicken is that I'm guaranteed (usually) a nice, full, plump breast. Which I got here. Slathered in their viscous mole sauce, it was absolutely fantastic,. The thing I don't like is that the rest of the meat you have to pick off isn't as good, and you now have to contend with things like fat and little bones. I actually do all of that scavenging first, delaying the gratification of eating the coveted breast. I do weird stuff when I eat, what can I say?   It came on a bed of  - you guessed it - rice & beans. Still as good as they were the other night.   The staff is very dependent on how good they can predict your tip will be. Meaning, when they learn my gf and I won't be having appetizers or over-priced drinks, they tend to pay a little less attention. I understand they work on tips, but it shouldn't be my fault I don't want more than I ordered. It's obvious to me as a customer, and pretty annoying. But the food rocks, so I'll be sure to come back.",

    "text": "While I honestly ate here primarily for the jokes to tell later, and for the fun responses to the check-in here on Yelp, my service was some of the best on my most recent trip to Las Vegas.  Eric behind the bar made sure I knew all my options when ordering a plate of tacos and was quick with the beers, chips and salsa and even the check when I was done.  My food came out ridiculously fast and when I commented about it to Eric, he just smiled and said that what I ordered is so easy for them to make.   Still, give them credit for how there was basically no wait for my entree considering the place was about 75% full at dinnertime.  They were soft tacos (one chicken, one steak, one pork) with rice and beans and all the ingredients were hot and fresh.  Wish I had been a little hungrier to try an appetizer or some of that fried ice cream, but there's always a next time. I will not hesitate to come back since I always seem to visit Hard Rock Hotel as they always offer great drink specials in the sports book bar and self-parking is among the easiest of any casino.  While my first choice for Mexican food in Las Vegas continues to be Javier's at Aria, Pink Taco is a good spot and I was very impressed with the service.  Besides, where else will you find employees wearing T-Shirts that actually say, \"Eating out never tasted so good.\"",

When I eat here, I order the three small corn tortilla chicken tacos with cheese, and a chipotle chicken tamale. The tamales are to die for and I CRAVE them from time to time!  The chips and salsa are also really yummy.   Sometimes the service is a little slow when it's not busy, and we had to ask for silverware last time. But that's understandable from time to time as long as the food is delicious.

I was coveting that look before I even saw it there!  The only negative is that it is EXTREMELY loud in there.  Our service was good.  For some reason, my husband did not think our service was very good, but I thought our server was attentive even though she had a lot of tables kind of spread all over.  We ordered the corn fritters and they were tasty.  Loved the sauce they came with.  For my meal I went with the app nachos.  I was going to get the Diablo nachos, but our server warned that they were insanely spicy, so I just went with the regular.  They were good, but the chicken on them was a little salty for me.  Still very enjoyable with both sour cream and guacamole and a cheese sauce and melted cheese.  Good stuff.  The husband ordered the signature Pink Tacos and he said he really liked them.  They came with Chicken and were served with Rice and Beans.  He must have liked it all because it was all gone!  The prices are reasonable for Vegas standards and we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate, so it was quite affordable.

    "text": "I ate at a lot of places during vacation but this was one of the worst! Service was okay which is the ONLY reason this is getting two stars.  The food is worth maybe 1 1/2 stars.  Started with nachos which were okay.. Nothing to write home about. Standard. Greasy. Needed heat. For my drink I chose a horchata which tasted like a cheap premade mix which was disappointing for a $15 drink. It was also supposed to be rimmed with cinnamon sugar.. It came out without the rimmed glass so I asked about it and the waitress said it was on the glass.. Which is wasn't at all.  Then the horrible meal- breakfast burrito. Was supposed to have beans and peppers and onions.. When it came out it was a mush burrito with eggs and beans only. Literally felt like I was having baby food. Again with the inconsistency in the menu. Two ingredients were just missing from my burrito. Unfortunately, it was inedible and I sent it back. Manager was pretty friendly about it and explained that they were going through a menu change so maybe that's why all the variations from the menu? I don't know. There are WAY better places than here! Take the time to look and save yourself some aggravation.. Unless you like ordering one thing and getting something different!",

The hostess was very lackadaisical and also did not ask us where we would prefer to sit as well if we wanted a high or low table although we saw that they asked everyone after us where they would prefer to sit.  My girlfriend ordered their pink tacos but was disappointed when they brought her out standard flour tacos although she specifically requested the pink corn tortillas.  I ordered the al pastor tacos with the pineapple salsa and I was very satisfied with my order.  The waitress we had was very attentive so the bad review is of no fault of hers.    Overall I was satisfied with the food, I would suggest that the hostesses give each patron the same welcoming experience as everyone else.  Also, if the restaurant is not that busy, there really should be no reason for orders to be wrong.",

    "text": "I have read some of the reviews here and was curious to try the food here.  It is located on the ground floor of the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel.  It has a full bar along with indoor and outdoor seating.  I decided to get the Mocajete Platter!  Wow is all I have to say.  Think fajitas served in a stone, and extremely hot, mocajete bowl filled with Mexican rice, grilled peppers and onions, grilled shrimp, beef fajita, and chicken fajita, topped with a whole charred jalapeno on the top.  It comes with four of their freshly made flour tortillas.  This is a meal in itself and will easily feed two hungry people.  I was warned about it's size beforehand, so I decided to go light on the complementary warm and truly flavorful chips and medium hot salsa.  I was stuffed and still had enough to make two large burritos to take with me.  The ingredients are high quality and just the tiny things like the large grained rice and the peppers they use are noticeable.  The rice grains were plump and well seasoned.  The grilled peppers they use are not your typical bell peppers, rather they use dark mild green chilis, perhaps Serrano or poblano, I'm not sure, but over the top of what you would expect.  The manager came by to ask how everything was, as well did the waitress.  It was a nice experience and I was finally glad to stuff myself with some fine Northern Mexican style food.  All the other dishes I saw being delivered looked great.  When in Las Vegas, I will definitely drop in to feed my craving.  By the way, If you have a players card with Hard Rock, there is a nice discount which is also reflected on the menu prices.",

After a long hot day at the pool we were all really hungry. We decided to stop at Pink Taco on the way in from the pool. We were all dressed in causal type pool clothing. (Shorts, t-shirts, sandals) we had no problems getting in. Pink Taco has a cool cantina vibe with fun art work and decor. Our waiter was at our table very quickly with chips and Salsa and took our drink order. Everyone at our table got something a little different. 3 of us shared the Zonkey Nachos with Carne Asada. The nachos came on a large plate and were piled high with Black beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole , jalapenos, Carne Asada and a delicious sauce over the top of them. We all loved the nachos, in fact everyone at our table did (we ended up sharing because everyone wanted some) Some of our family and friends had tacos and they all said they were great as well. We will for sure go back to Pink Taco when we visit Las Vegas again. The food was excellent and the service was very good.",

All the appetizers are spot on & delicious. For entrees we all shared the mushroom tacos, shrimp tacos and the pork chili verde. Again all dishes were excellent. Claudia was our server and she was very attentive & friendly.   I would recommend Pink Taco to any one. food is always great, service is right up their as well. Love this place!!",

Hubby and I went to Vegas for our anniversary and stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Pink taco was one of the highlights to our stay there. We ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner lol.  The service is amazing! You can eat inside or outside and we chose outside every time. We love the view of the trees and the shade from the pink umbrellas.  They give you complimentary nacho chips and dip before your meal and the salsa that comes with that taste amazing.   One of the best items on the menu has to be the turkey burger. Not your average turkey burger. This one is in a pita with a special sauce and cheese. Trust me you won't regret it. Thank me later!   The prices are great and the next time we come, even if we don't stay at the hard rock, we are definitely coming to Pink Taco!",

It is bright and full of mexican folk art. they even have a mini zonkey at the door to take pics with! The patio has awesome murals all over it. it also has an amazing view of the pool area because in case you don't know this restaurant is located in the hard rock hotel. the souvenirs here at pink taco are super cool, too. Unfortunately, the food and service are just mediocre. The chips were stale the beverages were not refilled. my husbands carnitas were just a small portion though flavorful. props on the homemade tortillas, however. My chile relleno was large and fresh, not canned chile pepper wrapped in breading. in conclusion folks come here for a tank or a magnet skip the so- so food.",

We were driving past the Hard Rock Hotel and since I have had Pink Taco on my list of places to eat, we decided to give them a try. The place is very trendy and since all the costumers in there looked like rock musicians I felt a little out of place. The wait staff was very friendly though.   They have a late night menu with about a dozen item on it. The corn tamales and taquitos were vegetarian friendly so we gave them a try. The tamales were amazing. The taquitos were ok.   Parking is the same as for the hotel and casino. Valet is the easiest if you don't mind waiting for your car.   We may come back again but not for just Pink Taco. We were tired and wanted to head back to our room on the Strip, so we did not get to see all the great music memorabilia at the Hard Rock. Another trip and better planning.",

Since I have had nothing but great experiences at both the Sunset and Century City locations in LA, I assumed the same would go for Vegas. Wrong.  For just 2 people, it didn't take long for us to be seated as there weren't many people inside. Our waitress Melisa, however, was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude. She didn't come check on us one time, and passed us to walk through several times. When asked how big the burritos were, she just shrugged and acted like it's not her job to know the menu at the restaurant she works at.   She only was waiting on 2 other tables while we were there, and she couldn't even bring us out our food or refill our waters.   As for the food, I got the CHicken Tostada Salad and I have absolutely no complaints., thus the one star. My friend ordered the Burrito Mojado and the rice and beans that came with it were terrible. Runny beans and hard rice don't go well with anything.   Besides the extremely terrible service, when she brought us the check, she charged us 3 bucks for sour cream, which came on my salad but I asked for it on the side. After waiting about 10 minutes and us asking to speak to her manager, she said we could just go up to the cashier and ask.   The cashier was apparently the host and greeter all in one, so it took a while for us to even notice we were there. She did end up taking off the charge after our explanation.  I planned on complaining about the waitress but the manager was busy getting a complaint from someone else in the restaurant so I settled for leaving Melisa no tip :)  Lesson learned, I'll just stick to LA!",

It's faster and you don't have to deal with the forgetfulness and slow pace of the servers.  When I sat here to eat, the server forgot about our waters, brought out food separately, and didn't acknowledge that she was messing up. It was not even as busy as I've seen this place get.  I'll probably come back before or after I hit up Rehab again but definitely ordering to go like the first time I came here. It was quick and they got the order right.",

And their chicken enchiladas are a big fav of mine. Everything has a nice spice to it. It's a tad overpriced for what you get. But, hey, it's inside the Hard Rock - by definition, everything there is overpriced. The staff are usually friendly and attentive. The bar area is nice for solo dining. There's video poker at the bar. It's kinda cool to be able to watch them make tortillas. It's rarely too crowded. And the menu has lots of options. So, all in all, this is a pretty good spot for faux Mexican fare.",

As the food got to the table you are just over the whole thing, now again the food is not bad but over priced which is ok certainly that's not the first place but with expensive food comes great service to me and that is just not the case.

But, as the locations have slowly closed around the western US, this location is my least favorite.  Not sure why they don't carry the best thing: BRISKET TACOS -- the other locations had it, and the Century City location still carries it.  OMG - it's the best!  I've been 5-6 times to this location at the Hard Rock.  The food is just okay, nothing great.  They do have great chips & salsa, delicious margaritas, but food - eh.  This is a great hangout, though.  Always good to pop into before/after a concert or a night out with friends.  Rumor has it, their website states, that a sunset strip location in Hollywood is coming soon!  Bring it, and bring it soon with the Brisket tacos!  Other locations may be San Diego and Miami.",

For two people, it was $54. The food was good and it was discounted for gamblers, but if I had to pay over $50 for the quality I would be upset. Definetly people should come here and try it out, just know the quality isn't worth the price.",

But I expected that when I came in here. Its Vegas after all.   Anyways. It was midday and we were here for \"breakfast\" It wasn't crowded. Got seated almost immediately.  It is VERY pink in there. Pink tinted lights and what not.   Had the Queso Fundido. My mouth still waters thinking about this stuff. Its like a super creamy cheesy bean dip.   I had the burrito and it was good. I liked it. I do not remember what my girlfriend had. I think it was the Nachos. I am pretty sure that it is the Nachos. They were good I seem to remember.   Chips and salsa were good as well.   Overall we were very pleased with our experience here.   Oh and the selection of Tequila was very good. I didn't have a drink here, but I saw that they did have a good selection.    Every time we talk about Vegas, we talk about the Pink Taco and how we cant wait to go back the next time we are there.",

The server was the best part she understood we were hungry and brought us food and drinks as fast as she could.  It's not her fault the music was loud and horrible, and that our food was greasy and gross. Left her a good tip even though our ears were ringing and our stomachs hurt when we left.",

The food on the other hand was delicious which bumps my rating up to 4 stars. The Carne Asada Fries were delicious and you can't beat $6 at happy hour.

I seriously don't know how these people can listen to the same techno dance music over and over again.   But, other than that, I loved their food. I ordered a chicken tostada salad which was very fresh and had pretty good amounts of chicken. Their guac is so delish. I couldn't stop eating it. It had a little kick!!   Service was bleh. Not that great but not that bad either. We needed refills on our drinks and when they dropped off our food for a table of 8 they bolted and didn't ask us if we needed anything. Super annoying.  I probably won't be back only because of jersey shore douches that like to come here.",

    "text": "Pink Taco is ok. Our server was really nice and helpful! Always filled our glass without us asking. Only thing I have to whine about is the quality of the food, and pricing. Obviously to me, I feel that there is some sort of unwritten rule that says \"the ratio of good quality food must be equivalent to the price\". I feel that this ratio is a bit off where it leans more towards a high price/ low grade food quality ratio.  We got a $12 pomegranate Margarita which was of course had that big round house tequila kick to the face! But that's a given...its a margarita.  $5.99 Fried Fried Ice Cream- Don't be fooled. It a big scoop of ice cream in a generic, but fancy looking ice cream cone cup. I mean I'd be sold on it if it had some sugar and cinnamon \"churro\" like seasoning to it, but it was plain. Then the choco syrup had some weird taste to it. Like it was spiked with alchy. I'm all for spiked drinks, but spiked syrup? Nay..  $12.99 Baja Fish Tacos- SUPER SMALL PORTIONS! The fish slices WERE SMALL! I felt like they must have gone through some serious cut backs since the BP oil spill. I mean it's like they killed their pet goldfish and served it to me in a tortilla (poor goldfsh!!!!!)  $8.99 Chicken Skewers- Thumbs up to tenderness...but my sister wasn't too happy to find  nicely redish pink center to it. SMH.  Service is nice. The restaurant decor is fun and festive, but food is just not worth it. Thankfully the awesome Yelpers on here knows where the REAL tacos are!!",

    "text": "Oh, Vegas. You're such a sleaze. The sleaze knees. You know how to make everything sound raunchier than it really is.  Like tacos. Pink taco..now if that isn't a graphic innuendo, I don't know what is.  One might take it the wrong way. As in...is this a \"lesbi-honest\" kind of restaurant...or is it open to all orientations?  One might also upset a family from Idaho if you pass them in the halls while talking on your iPhone saying \"I SO want to eat a pink taco. Or maybe THREE!! Damn, I've been craving them ALL WEEK!!\"  Settle down, people, it's a tex-mex taco joint. Take away the sleazy name, and all you've got is your standard mexican fare, where the only thing that's gonna get you hot and bothered is the hot sauce. :)  Anyway, so I order the pink tacos, because I rationalize that if they're going to name the entire restaurant on one entree, it must be the fucking bomb. Well, it was 'aight. I think it tasted better than it really was, because I was in town for a work convention and I was surviving off protein bars and almonds the majority of the time. You could probably just serve me refried beans in the shape of a taco, and I would have thought that was the best meal on earth at that very moment.   But hey, I'm not complaining. It was way more affordable and much tastier than the convention center food. Not saying it's so good I want to come back kind of good, but it does the job, the servers are nice, and the place had a chill vibe.",

    "text": "I wrote my original review about 5 years ago. I haven't been back until last week. I gamble at the Hard Rock Hotel and because I do so HRH sends promotional literature in the mail. Pink Taco was having an all you can eat special for Taco Tuesday. SOLD!   I actually came in to Pink Taco twice that same week. Once because of the Taco Tuesday special and second because I had a voucher to use.   Upon my return, I sat at the bar at lunch time during the week. No one was at the bar other than myself and the bartenders. I was greeted by the bartender and within minutes I had a beer and 3 tacos in hand.   Al pastor - ROASTED PORK, PINEAPPLE SALSA Shrimp -  RED CABBAGE SLAW, CHIPOTLE CREMA, AVOCADO Carne Asada - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE  I asked for no cheese on my carne asada taco. Everything came out fast AND correct. And each taco was SO good. The asada I would love to taste w/ a different choice of sauce or even salsa. It needed a bit more flavor than just pico de gallo. The bartender was a sweetheart. Couldn't have asked for better service. 5 stars on this day.  When I returned again that week, I was hungry for some of tasty tacos I had earlier in the week. Like last time I sat at the bar. Again, like last time no one was at the bar. And much like last time I arrived when the place wasn't busy, noon. Baffled both times I came in and it wasn't jam packed for lunch.   I ordered the all you can eat tacos for Taco Tuesday.   Gringo - CRISPY CORN TORTILLA, GROUND BEEF, CHEDDAR CHEESE, PICO DE GALLO, SHREDDED LETTUCE, SOUR CREAM Al Carbon Chicken - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE Al Pastor - PICO DE GALLO, COTIJA CHEESE  Like last time I asked for no cheese on my tacos. When the food came out, guess what was on it? CHEESE! Not a huge deal, as I can eat cheese, but on this day I just didn't want cheese. I ate the food as is and just like last time, the food was spot on. It was a bummer when the food came out incorrectly. The bartender who greeted me was very enthusiastic and friendly, started out strong until this happened. There was nobody else at the bar, but he was distracted by another employee and game going on.   Pink Taco has certainly stepped up their customer service since the last time I was here. Still could use some work, but has grown.   My tastebuds approve this message!",

    "text": "First impressions:  housed in the back of the hard rock, on the way to the paradise tower, is a brightly lit pink taco.  On the inside it feels like an adobe cantina that is decorated with low riders and other flashy trinkets.  I initially went in to get breakfast, but the hostess let me know that they only serve breakfast Friday and Saturday. She was nice enough to suggest a few other restaurants that did serve breakfast, but I still wanted to give this place a try.  Food:  Chips and salsa (free): My wife and I are very big on the free chips and salsa as it is usually an indicator on how the meal will be. I was very happy with this dish!  Just because it is free doesn't mean it doesn't represent the food at your establishment,  and this didn't disappoint.  I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spice but it had the perfect bite for me.  Chicken tacos ($12):  The chicken tacos were loaded with ingredients and flavor.  I wanted something light that could fill my breakfast craving, and also fill my belly. It was very tasty!  I chose flower tortilla and it was fresh and warm. The waitress brought me some Tapatio, they are hot sauce of choice.  Honestly, I didn't need it but I enjoyed it!  I added the rice and beans for four dollars, I just wanted to see what it tasted like, and it was fine.  It tasted like a standard refried beans and rice, but I appreciate that. I'd rather something standard but solid rather than inventive and bad.  Bloody Mary ($11):  I didn't care what vodka, so they used Svedka.  This was another example of standard bloody Mary ingredients tasting great! People go crazy with their bloody Mary's, and it can become too much or overwhelming. This was a classic and it held up.  Service:  Claudia was my waitress, and I usually don't put names in my reviews but this experience was outstanding! She was very familiar with the menu and gave great suggestions, brought me my hot sauce, and reminded me to use my players card when checking out.  I had no complaints about this experience, and it gets a five-star for me! Would come back!",

    "text": "You can't really NOT go to a restaurant with a provocative name like \"Pink Taco\", so we gave it a shot. And I wasn't super impressed.  We made a reservation for six people at 8:30PM. We got there right at 8:30PM and were told it would be just a couple minutes as they set up the table. There were empty six-seater tables everywhere, so that was a bit annoying to hear. At 8:45PM, we were starting to get a bit frustrated and that is when the hostess told us \"They're just clearing off the table, it'll be a few mins.\" What is the point of a reservation if y'all aren't going to have it ready at the actual time? Reservations seem to be more of a \"guideline\" here.   We were seated once the table was ready and it was moderately busy at this point. We made it a point to select our food/drinks and order them all at once since it took a while for our waitress to show up. The waitress just didn't seem to be super charismatic which I think I understand - she probably gets pummeled with drunk assholes all day/night and maybe assumed we were another. But...we were not. Just trying to enjoy some grub.   Speaking of grub, we were not disappointed here! Boyfriend and I had the steak fajitas. I felt they were a bit pricey but you are in Vegas, so this is expected. They were $19. They had plenty of beans/rice/guac and handmade tortillas for the fajitas. They also asked how we wanted the fajita steak done which I was super excited about. I've only ever had chewy and gross fajita meat, and it was nice to have something medium-rare. The veggies were perfectly grilled, too...having been used to soggy veggies this was refreshing! Green sauce was tasty, and guac was good too.   We got the tequila flight for $15, where you can pick one from each style of tequila. It was definitely interesting. With a 20% tip, the meal was about $70 dollars. Seems like a lot for some Mexican food, especially when you can get some dank Mexican food elsewhere in LV.   Although the food was good, the service was not - on all fronts. Waitress, hostess, etc. On those grounds, I probably wouldn't come back to Pink Taco unless somebody really wanted to go in the group I'm with.",

The kind who lets your glass go dry and makes you wait for ever even while your eating. The kind who isn't very helpful when your trying to figure out what to order.   I ate here two years ago and loved it. Tonight I went with the pink taco which was good but ordinary. Last time what ever I had was amazing just couldn't remember think it might have been quesadillas because they make fresh homemade tortillas so my guess is I might have gone that route because there are few things better than fresh made flour tortillas in my opinion.   I remembered they had an amazing very hot salsa and it took a few minutes to drill it out of the server. Well worth the dollar upgrade fee in my opinion.   My other guess is I probably had guacamole last time because that's generally one of my favorites. But this server took the order and ran off before I had the chance to add it to my order.   I still enjoyed my meal. Diet Coke and chips with no green stuff. I'll take pink any day. Even with an annoying server this place is pretty good. And I'm someone who is very particular with my Mexican food",

I tried 3 and the best was definitely the Specialty Pink Taco (with chicken). I love the pickled onion on it. The crispy fish taco was not very crispy and actually tasted very fishy. The spicy mayo on it help cover up the poor quality fish a little. I also tried the ground beef taco which comes in a crispy shell and this one honestly reminded me of a Taco Bell taco. My friend ordered the Heavos Rancheros off the brunch menu and that was pretty good. If you are at the hard rock I think a better choice of places to eat would be Culinary Dropout or FU kitchen.",

    "text": "I'd describe it as fine, but hardly the best option you have for the money, at $15-20 per entree.  My girlfriend and I shared a few $7 appetizers. She had the grilled octopus herself and loved it. We shared the chicken taquitos and vampiro chicken tacos. The taquitos were average. I wish they were crispier.  The chicken taquitos were pretty good though. They were very flavorful, but definitely on the salty and fatty side, and lacking a complementary flavor. I thought it tasted way better once I squeezed some lime on it.   The tortilla chips were below average. Our first batch wasn't warm. The second batch was only slightly warm. And both weren't crunchy or flavorful at all. It felt like they weren't the freshest either.  The service was fine, but not great. We sat at the bar. They did a good job of keeping the tortilla chips coming without us asking for more, which I personally appreciated, although I could see others not liking more food being shoved in their face without asking for it. They weren't very friendly though. I liked the vampiro chicken tacos but forgot what we ordered, so I asked one of the bartenders if he could remind me what is in this and he just said \"chicken\" and walked away. I thought that was a little cold.  I ended up feeling sick afterwards. My girlfriend didn't, and I initially figured it was just me. But then I was talking to my girlfriends mom after and when I mentioned that we just ate at Pink Taco, she mentioned that she doesn't like it there and got sick when she ate there. So idk, maybe somethings up.",

    "text": "Deliciously flavorful Mexican food !  I have a very discerning palate when it comes Mexican food and Pink Tacos definitely hit the mark.  The chips and salsa are super tasty, as the salsa has a smoked flavor to it, it's not just tomatoes, onions, and cilantro thrown together.   My party had the street tacos, chicken enchiladas, nachos, fried chicken burrito, and my vegetarian wife had the chicken tortilla soup, minus the chicken.  Everything had flavor, meaning each ingredient had a flavor, it wasn't just a bunch of ingredients thrown together and then seasoned.  I would highly recommend Pink Tacos and will be back again soon!  They also have great happy hour specials.",

Only thing I didn't not like was I walked in and the place was kind of empty and it took about 5 minutes before anyone knew we were standing there , once seated mostly everything was good , just that the server did not refill our drinks ,5 stars for good food",

The salsa had lots of flavor that put you right there.   This place was good and fast. If you want something easy to grab, tastes good, with good service - go here.",

    "text": "Located in the Hard Rock hotel. Decent Mexican food, quality server, decent prices for Vegas. Unfortunately they only offer red or white wine one choice of each and don't offer a corkage fee/option. That's my drink of choice so a little unaccommodating. My only real complaint is they don't tell you that if you are going to the concert, right next door, you can't bring in your leftovers. I understand no outside food, but it's literally 10 steps away. They won't store or hold it for you either. If that's the policy, the server should mention before you order so you can plan accordingly.  Tequila sampler was fun and reasonable.  Would rate a 4 if not for the wine selection and leftover frustration.",

Please check out my revised happy hour menu as it has recently changed (as of Jan 2018)  Overall I feel like if you can make the time, happy hour is a great value. We had a $30 food credit to burn between me and my husband and we put it to good use. We got to try a lot of different things:  Steak skewers - These were fantastic. We liked them so much we got a second order.   Grilled octopus - pretty good. Not a huge portion but I'm a fan of octopus and it ain't usually cheap so I thought this was a good value.   Vampiro chicken tacos - Eh I wasn't crazy about these. I'd skip them next time. They were fun to try.   I also wanted a salad but didn't want to pay a lot, so you can actually order a half salad which was perfect because it was just enough for me.   My husband also liked the 2 for 1 beer special going on.   All in all a solid choice for happy hour to try some fun stuff. We will have to come back for a regular meal although it won't be as cheap.",

We walked into Pink Taco on Saturday night, it was pretty packed but our group of four was sat right away. My friends got the fajitas, tamales, tacos and I got the burrito. The plates were really big serving and they had to take boxes home, I finished my burrito there. It was really good.   We also ordered the guacamole for the table as an appetizer, yum! It was gone lightning fast. Service was good, not exceptional or poor. Prices inflated because its Vegas but on par with everything else on the Strip.",

You get a view of the pool area so during summer you can see all the action aka drunk people lol.   So I always tend to get the regular tacos because their tortillas are freshly made all day long. I can admit I think the flower tortillas were just way better then the corn but that's my opinion. I tried the pink taco for the first time and it was really good they have pickled onions on top. But to be honest it's the deep fried ice cream that always gets me. For some reason this time around maybe because of the holidays they gave us 3 different kinds of deep fried ice cream. 1 regular which I think is corn flakes around it, the other fruity pebbles and the last coco pebbles omg it was to die for. Trust me you won't be let down trying this spot out. I mean who doesn't love tacos and alcohol lol.",

First the portions got smaller with an attempt at \"gourmet plating, then regular size portions were brought back but the quality of the food was not as good as the first time.  I use to love eating their carne asada tacos, but no more. On this last visit, the meat was so over cooked it tasted like very dry and old beef jerky! They no longer use real guacamole! Instead, they squirt avocado crema which is very nasty! It is a pale green color hue with a mayo aftertaste! Gross!!  The margaritas were a little too sweat and I recall them tasting way better in the past. Not too sweet and you could  taste the fresh squeezed lime.  My friend had the grilled fish tacos and she said her fish was not fresh and was dry!  The chips n salsa are good, the service is fine and they have a great bar to gamble and watch sports. I miss the old Pink Taco menu. Please bring it back Harry Morton!!!",

Chips and salsa are generic, salsa lacks any sort of kick. Not sure why each table gets two bowls of the same salsa either, unless someone made a mistake. Speaking of service, it was also very basic- barely saw my waitress, was never asked how the food was, only got a smile out of her when we got the bill.  I had high hopes for the ahi tacos, but the fish, though fresh, is not marinated or seasoned in any way- rendering the order bland, basic, and boring. For $16, even downtown, it should have some sort of flavor.  Subtracted an additional star for lying about happy hour- HR website says it's 3-7PM, Mon-Fri. Waitress says they don't have one, when I mention the site she states it's at the bar only, and there is no food on it.

It's right behind the pool party located at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.   The chicken tacos were the best. Well seasoned and had a good amount of sauce. On the other hand, the shrimp tacos were lackluster. They didn't have any sauce ( I used some from my chicken tacos) and the fish was fried. I was hoping it was fresh shrimp and instead it tasted like it was previously frozen. Please, make the shrimp tacos with all the same fixings as the chicken and they'd be much better.   All-in-all, a cute place with cute decor and good tacos!",

We saw that they had a happy hour unless there was an event at The Joint ( which for a Friday night that is almost a guarantee). When we got there, we told them we didn't have as many in our party that we reserved, so she asked us to wait while she pulled the tables apart. Mind you there were only maybe six people in there.  We chose the bench when we booked, which is pretty hard. We asked about the happy hour. When I told her what we saw online, she told me that it had changed the beginning of the year. The times shrunk by two hours, it is only happy hour at the bar, but she did ask the manager to accommodate us and make an exception. For being a pescitarian and not being able to eat flour, there wasn't much on there for me. So, our waitress helped me choose something.  The employees were really nice. The food was good and the drinks were great. My first time have white sangria, and I really liked it. It looked like they also have out door seating, but not completely sure. I have wanted to try this place for a while, and I am glad I finally got the chance.",

The idea of a party of ten clearly freaked out the hostess even though the place was a quarter full. Then they tried to seat us outside where its 106 degrees out not quite understanding we're in business clothes and not bathing suits. Not the best training here for the FOH it seems. Once we were seated the service was fine.  The food is white people Mexican, so that's what to expect. Most people love that shit so go nuts. My veggie burrito was OK, although the sauce on top was pretty bitter and no one seemed too stoked on their food. Once again, what do you expect.  The worst part is the name. I'm a pretty crass person, but the idea of a business meeting full of foul business bros coming up with this idea for a vagina innuendo and then probably hi fiving about it gives me the fucking creeps.   I'm going to open up a competing place called the \"Salty Pickle\"...maybe it'll serve \"Cock-tales\". Hi five bro!",

There were several guests standing with me waiting to be seated, and several staff 3 feet away, but none of them acknowledged us, no one told us someone would be there to seat us shortly, not even eye contact or a smile. So totally unacceptable given they really were not that busy. When my food was delivered it was lukewarm and really only average taste. Recommend avoiding this place.",

In addition they had fresh avocado and a spicy mayo sauce thati was just fantastic.   They always have cold beer and rock on the radio.

I came here for lunch once and had to get a seat at the bar because there was a lunch wait for a table - that's definitely different.  Unfortunately, the wait is more a reflection of the 'hey, who wants to eat at Pink Taco (giggle, giggle)' mentality than of the food.  I've had better Mexican food at a Chevy's for chrissake.  There's just nothing fun or different about it.  The restaurant itself is visually interesting and there's balcony seating by the pool, so that's nice.  Nice just kinda sums up the entire place.

They serve white rice mixed with canned vegetables. The salsa is also not freshly made. The nearest taco shop has better salsa. I ordered  a combination plate which came with a Chile relleno, a veggie taco and a rajas tamal. The veggie taco was the most edible thing on my plate. It cost $18. Maybe I am being harsh because I am Mexican and I know what Mexican food should be like. I also ordered a guacamole appetizer and that was a 3.5 out 5 stars. In all, this place is way over priced for the quality of food they serve. Good luck if you come here.",

We were seated right away, but it took the server a good 10-15 minutes to bring us water, or ask us if we are ready to order food. This was pre-lunch rush, so I don't understand what took them so long. Especially because they seemed well-staffed...actually a tad over-staffed??? Many employees were hanging out doing nothing, and it was a bit aggravating to wait for someone to really notice your group.  I ordered an appetizer (which was decent, but small portions) and the Pink Taco Platter (chicken, beans, picked onions, avocado). Honestly, the food was terrible. Chicken was sorta cold, the beans were mushy, the picked onions didn't do much and the taco shell was oily as hell. My colleague was a bit underwhelmed with the service delay, and how we were practically full before our main order was even taken (Due to the abundance of complimentary tortilla chips being served by our non-waiter).  On the drive back, all of us mutually agreed that this was a very underwhelming dining experience. I wouldn't mind going back to this place for the drinks, but when you have a place called Pink Taco that serves shitty tacos...its game over!",

I don't know it if was my selection or if they have just simple fell off, but the joy I typically have eating there just was not there. The portion size was good, the prices average and the service was what you typically expect, but the food itself was just not that good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos and it lacked something (aka flavor). I had to added so much hot sauce to make it taste an ounce of what it should & steak naturally has a bit a flavor so I am not quite sure why that was. And although they use fresh corn tortillas, it still could not save the taste of these tacos. On the other hand, the chips and salsa were pretty good, but I hardly expect that free chips and salsa can make up for mediocre food you actually pay for.",

Nothing really special about this place.... kinda what you expect from a Vegas-hotel mexican place.",

We had time to kill so we ate at pink taco. I ordered the chimichanga meal. Around 12 bucks at the time but man it was awesome . Had some chipotle sauce and free chips and salsa with guac.... Awesome. And usually coronas taste a bit burnt and bitter but not here. I mean they taste really fresh and heavenly. This place is legit!",

But, they do serve a nice portion of free tortilla chips with 3 different salsas which was very nice. I bought a cheese and chicken enchillada meal which was decent, but like I said Mexican food to me is just bleh. We sat outside and they have outdoor heaters, sadly the heaters get way too hot and the temperature can't be adjusted--either it's too hot or you just leave the thing off cause it feels like you're getting sunburned sitting under it. Once the meal was over, they give these fortune cookie-like pink tacos. Honestly, they taste like shit. Everyone at the table took one bit and put it back down. Ick. Anyway, it's a good place for groups and service wasn't bad.",

When we were planning our Concert day, I looked Pick Taco up to see what kind of food was served there. Two of us wanted to go there and two others wanted to go to Johnny Smalls. But when we got to the Hardrock we decided on Pink Taco because it was closer to the joint and because it just looked cute. We were taken to a table as soon as we got there. The atmosphere was great, and the service couldn't be better. The waiter was fun, and made us laugh. He checked on us a lot, as did other waiters. I really didn't know what to choose out of the menu and the waiter suggested the \"Sabana de pollo con chimichurri\". It was amazing, and had so much flavor. It was also afordable. All of my friends chose different dishes, and at the end they all loved the service and the food. Awesome, I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "Dear Pink Taco,  I so wanted to love you ever since my mom came to a catered event her several years ago. When I was picking out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificates, I just knew I had to have you in my life. I love \"upscale\" Mexican food, and was hoping you could deliver. Sadly, you did not.   Your hostesses sat us very quickly and I applaud the quick chip and salsa delivery. I didn't realize how hungry I was until your delicious salsas were in my face and your warm chips were breaking all over the table in my impatience. Little did I know this was to be the best of the meal.   Your server took approximately a year to even take our drink order. Then, throughout the meal, he proceeded to commit two cardinal sins in a restaurant: asking if we were doing okay with his hands full and his back 3/4 turned away from us, as though we were an afterthought, and the second, putting the check down before asking if we wanted anything else. Pink Taco, this server did not earn his included 18%.   On to your strange food choices. I ordered your famed Pink Tacos, which had little flavor until I added the aforementioned salsas. The tortillas were good, the pickled onions too, but the chicken and black bean paste were dull. I so wanted to like your taquitos, our chosen appetizer, but the flavor was strange and by only receiving 3 tiny taquitos for $7.50, I sighed for those who would pay full price for them.    The bottom line, dear sweet Pink Taco, is that you have all the potential for a great awesome upscale Mexican food reinvention--great decor, interesting menu items, and a provocative (albeit silly) name.  Somehow, you missed the mark and I hope we can be together again under better circumstances.   Love,  Molly T.",

The Pink Taco is generally pricey so I usually save lunch there for a special occasion and was willing to pay extra because of the quality of the food.  What have they done to this place?  First, they changed the menu and my favorite meal was not on the menu.  SO ok. . . I will try something else. . . The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.  The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.  The meat seemed frozen and old.  The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.    The taquitos were burned, served with a lump of so so guacamole.  I tried mixing the guacamole with the tasteless chipolte ranch sause to try to get something that tasted good and had a good texture.  This didn't work.  The margarita which was $12 tasted like a cheap glass of lemonade. . .Come on people. . .at least get the margurita right!    The manager did comp the chicken wings. . .We noticed that the people sitting next to us were less than thrilled with their meal as well. . .Whoever is in charge of this place now should be ashamed for taking a place where you could count on good atmosphere and good food into a gastronomic nightmare.    It will be a long long time before I go there again, if ever!",

The four of us order steak burritos which were good so that's why I gave them two stars. My overall experience was not good here and I will never go back to this restaurant.

The waiter said that margaritas were buy one get one, but when the check was presented it us later we had been charged for both margaritas to find out that it's only the HOUSE margarita that is buy one get one free. That wasn't explained to us at all and pretty much ruined the chances of my ever coming back here again.   Ordered the tortilla soup (which was not a happy hour offering) which was pretty delicious and filling. We also got the appetizer platter and out of all the things on the platter I only like the sweet corn tamales.   Overall I would never come back here again and would just walk out of the hotel to get my meal fix. One suggestion for Pink Taco would be to have a clearly designated menu for just Happy Hour drinks and food - a lot of people would get screwed over less this way.",

It seemed like the food was on our table within minutes of actually ordering it.    My hypothesis is that they have figured out how to manipulate the time-space continuum and are using this knowledge to gain that much needed edge in the restaurant business.  I could be wrong.  But, I digress; my girlfriend had come here before and loved their chili relleno.  So much so that she got it again!  Being from San Diego, it will be hard to please my appetite for Mexican, but Pink Taco made a valiant attempt.  I would not feel right giving this place a 4-star rating just because my dish would not hold up to some of the spots I'm used to in SD.    I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Hard Rock.",

If you wanna try a particular tequila, this is a good place to try ones you may not of heard of. My particular favs would be Tequila Corralejo and Casa Noble. The Mi Casa margarita on the rocks is a great starter.   My main food order is usually the tacos. Either the carne asada, carnitas or the fish. The salsa is really good to with tortialla chips which are a bit on the thicker side so it has a nice crunch to it.",

    "text": "Hmm I wonder what the proprietors could possible mean by \"PINK TACO\" :) Appropriately named for Vegas ,this place fits the bill for a good place to start for a night of debauchery. Happy hour from 4-7pm means you can get nice and inebriated before the night even begins... and being a little drunk might help to make the food more palatable. There may be many iron chefs, top chefs, and michelin rated restaurants in vegas, but pink taco is clearly not harboring any of those chefs or accolades.            the first time i ate here was many years ago for my bachelorette party- the meal was a blur of tequila shots- many many tequila shots-ughh i feel sick... the food itself- no recollection....               this time around we started out with the guac, margaritas and the corn tamales. guac and corn tamales- yum!!! we were off to a good start!! The corn tamales had a nice corn sweetness which went really well with the masa. The guac was just delic. The margaritas were where things started to fall apart. Definitely made with sweet and sour mix with a little too much mix thrown in- gross!           for dinner I ordered the fish tacos- huge mistake- BIG... Yeah i know they're fish tacos, but being overwhelmed by a fishy smell is not how I like my fish tacos. simply put the fish was less than fresh. I'm giving this place a three for the awesome apps, but unless you're looking for a fantastic place to start a bachelorette/bachelor night of drunken mayhem, I would avoid this place....",

The chips ans salsa were great and I love the different varities of salsas :) We sat at the outside patio, so we had a lil view of the pool area where Rehab is. Overall the service was pretty good ( better the 2nd time) and the food was great :)",

That's what I get for being on weight watchers.  That even after only two my body was revolting on Saturday morning.  The music was a little loud, perhaps.  The waiter was a bit too happy, perhaps.  But this IS Vegas.  And the cheesy chicken thing I had was delicious.  I believe that if I cared more about seeing and being seen, I'd like this place a little more. But I could care less and really just want good drinks, good food, and good service.  So, I'd say that Pink Taco adequately fills the bill.",

The tacos did not disappoint at all. Our waitress was a total doll and was super sweet. I didn't like my margarita and she quickly got me a beer. The only bummer was that we asked to change the television to the Dallas/Miami game and it took them our entire meal to do so. Besides that, it was a really pleasant and delicious experience, and I look forward to going back for their yummy tacos.",

This may be because we had a larger party, but there was no reason for the way we were treated. When we walked out we heard one of the hostesses whisper \"bi***\" to my Stepmother. Not ok. I guess i would have understood a little bit if my Stepmother was actually being rude, but that just wasn't the case.   Another thing is the food. I got chicken skewers, which were supposed to be really good, but apparently they had changed the recipe or something. They tasted like something i had never tasted before, and that is not a good thing. The mashed potato taquitos could maybe feed a mouse, if it was small. not worth the money by any means at all. The only good things about this place were the chips, and the tortillas.   there are so many other places in Vegas that will treat you the way you should be treated, and have food that actually tastes good. Don't waste your time or money, and go somewhere else. We would  have had a better Mexican food experience by going to Taco Bell.",

Got 2 pitchers of sangria sing me and my loved one enjoy it everywhere else but didnt get into a second cup of the second pitcher, WAY TOO MUCH Stuff in the drink to even drink it though a straw.  Good place for a snack but a waste of time and money for a meal",

If you live in L.A., S.D., AZ or TX, you probably know what is good and what is not.  If you taste the salsa, the guacamole, or the margaritas, you will be very disappointed.  A very gimmicky, 'plastic' Mexican restaurant with little flavor, no variety, and nothing unique.  Most of the (young) people eating here are loaded drunk from the bar and pool scene, hence the great reviews....the ONLY explanation.  Don't waste your time or $$$ here when there are tons of better quality food options in Vegas that are comparable in price, hire top-rated chefs and taste much better.  Don't be fooled by the 'rock and roll' image this place sells from the outside....it's basically a Mexican 'Hooters.'  A great alternative for dinner is the buffet at the Wynn Hotel.....hands down the best buffet I've ever been to....Everything is fresh, high-quality food, and every variety of foods you can imagine, including desserts!  Pastas, meats, salads, soups, seafood (endless, and popular, crab legs and lobster), etc.  Has been awarded top buffet in Vegas for a reason!  You won't be disappointed.  Always crowded (for good reason) so reservations are a must!  The various steakhouses around town are also a good option.  Vegas has all the top name steakhouse names in the country.",

However I really wish I paid more attention to the verbal reviews I received that warned me against eating here.  For, despite enjoying the flavor of the carnitas tacos while I ate them, the price I paid for the next 36 hours of gastro-intestinal misery was far from worth the few moments of guacamole deliciousness.    Normally, I would just attribute my digestion issues to residual side effects from drinking a yards worth of margarita composed of the absolute best of the bottom shelf alcohols, but when everyone else in my party started canceling their plans for their last night in Vegas in exchange for a bed/bathroom/pepto/alka-seltzer combination, my powers of deduction left me no other choice than to blame pink taco.  I don't think I'll eat here again.  Las Vegas has too many other amazingly fantastic places to eat. FIN",

It was rather bland.  I ended up pouring salsa from the chips and salsa on the tacos so they'd have some flavor.   Anyway, it took longer to get some service than to get my food.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad.  The food is good if you like Mexican stuff but don't want it to be spicy.  I'd heard about this place before which is why I didn't get up and walk away when I got no service from the bartender.

I have a Rock Star card at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, so they were supposed give us this deal where you got 99 cent tacos and margaritas for Happy Hour. He said he'd take care of us and he'd be right back with our food. 15 Minutes later, he came back and said he couldn't offer us the deal for some reason, because it wasn't the right time, or something but because he messed up, he'd give us a few tacos for the 99 cent offer. The guy literally took 45 mins to get us our food and drinks!! Definitely a bad experience and I was not too pleased at all.   Second time (2 Weeks Ago) -- It was awesome!! Waiter was real friendly and gave us good recommendations. The quesadillas and the enchilada platter were awesome! My only complaint was the margarita, while tasting great, was kinda small since it was like $12 and I finished it pretty quickly. Otherwise, the place had great food, a good selection of modern mexican food, and great service.   Overall, if I had a great experience both times I was there, I would probably give the place a 4, possible 5!",

Is it a ploy by the Hard Rock?  The people behind Rehab in the pool?  Is it a cruel joke for the local cuisine in Tijuana?  Nonetheless, people love getting their picture taken here for laughs and future giggles for dirty minds everywhere.  What most people didn't know is that it actually serves decent and expensive Mexican food.  Modeled closely after the neon lights beyond the border towns (.i.e La Frontera!) like Tijuana, this hip joint is bright, busy, and can get intensely crowded.  Like every place here at the Hard Rock, its super trendy and that may be a turn off for some die hard Mexican food lovers.  But environment only has so much to do with the food, as the tacos themselves take the top priority.  Don't expect taco stand prices here, as an appetizer may run you for a cool $16.  The tacos themselves are expertly prepared and look like they're out of a cooking magazine as they're so pretty.  I would even go as far as to say I had one of the best fish tacos here outside of Mexico and San Diego, all right here at this glamorized Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "Partying hard and hitting the tables at the Hard Rock last night got me in the mood for a taco. Having the Pink Taco on site was a perfect remedy. Collected my chips from the blackjack table as the sounds of Jimi Hendrix roared overhead and headed for the restaurant.   Entering the place you can't help but notice the cool custom made low rider bicycles hanging from the ceiling, the funky star shaped lights draped over the bar area, and the modern Mexican - meets retro chic decor with all types of knick knacks, old radios, and items strategically strewn about. As the place was packed I went for seat at the bar and immediately ordered an ice cold Negra Modelo. What is terrific is that you get a free metal bucket of crunchy crispy tortilla chips with three different salsa's to dip into. This stuff is like crack when you are hungry and have been drinking! Lakers vs Spurs was playing on the bar tv's and rock music was blaring throughout. Yes, this is a man's paradise!  Started with the sweet corn tamales with pico and sour cream. Three tamales came on this plate and it was actually a good amount of food. Sweet and buttery corn flavored. Ordered the fish tacos baha style. Fish battered and lightly fried with serrano-cilantro salsa, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Refried beans and rice accompanied the meal. The fish tacos were very good, not the best I have ever had as I still have had better in NYC and CA, but tasty with just the right amount of batter and not over fried. I love refried beans too, and these were smooth goodness.  My one complaint is that they brought out my main plate a minute after I got the appetizer. I literally had to eat both at the same time. I hate when restaurants do that. Time management people in the kitchen! Learn it!   Otherwise, a great place to go for a fun atmosphere and decent Tex-Mex food options. Rock On!",

Food was great, we both had fajitas and the portion sizes were huge (we couldn't finish even though we did not eat much for lunch) and the complimentary chips were tasty as well (we liked the occasional pink chips ;) ). The restaurant was nicely decorated and we enjoyed our visit.  The food itself was very tasty. Having lived in California for two years I would not call it authentic Mexican but still super tasty American Mexican (still more authentic than Chipotle) ;)  If you can, sit inside (outside seating is just next to the pool and music can get very loud)",

WARNING: Pink Taco is NOT authentic Mexican food. So if that's what you are looking for, you will leave feeling disappointed. I mean, they don't even have Horchata or anything. What Mexican restaurant doesn't have Horchata? haha  I ordered two carne asada tacos & one fish taco. The carne asada tacos were good, but I've had MUCH MUCH better fish tacos at other places. The rice was a little hard for my taste, but the beans were pretty good. The Lemonade kinda sucked.  The service wasn't great but it wasn't bad.   Overall, I thought it was okay. I don't mind trying different versions of Mexican food. I wouldn't really MIND coming back here.",

The beer menu was fairly good, they have all the crappy normal beers but also some good local-ish beers.

Our food came and we started eating- I WAS EATING when I noticed a weird spot on my rice - then I looked closer and it was some kind of BUG!  It was super small (still a BUG) and had tiny wings.  It was like pale greyish brown.  I was shocked!!  It was freaky, I couldn't figure out what it was!    Inside the panic and adrenaline was running!  I frantically looked around - cant everyone is this restaurant see this?!  It took a few LONG minutes to flag the waitress down - then I showed her.  She looked at me, looked at the food and said very loudly \"SHUT-UP\" (not rudely - but in an OMG - you have got to be kidding me)  she snatched up the plate and went toward the kitchen.  Im watching her like.. now what?  Finally I got up and went to go find her - where she was still lingering by the kitchen window - and i swear they were all smiling and getting a good chuckle out of this.  I told her we were leaving.  I double checked to make sure it was ok that we didn't have to pay for our meals or drinks - and she shrugged her shoulders and said it was fine.  When there is a living bug on your food - there are hundreds in the kitchen!  ADIOS Pink Taco.",

Service could be a little better. We came here before clubbing at Body English since it's located in the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel and Casino too. I was surprised how good it was. Once you walk in they have an authentic Mexican lady making tortillas behind a glass wall (typical Vegas show). They serve fresh, hot chips with 3 very deliciously fresh distinctive salsas. All three are different yet good in their own tastes. I ordered the tostada salad thing. It was the right amount of food before a night of clubbing. The lettuce was fresh, and light, and nothing was overpowering the other. I really, really enjoyed it. The decor and atmosphere is pretty good and fun! I would give this place 4 out of 5 stars because I think my coworkers whom I came here didn't really like what they ordered (taquitos were a bit starchy). Personally I give it a 5! Not a bad place, I'd go back again, if there weren't so many nice places.",

They bring you chips with 3 different salsas to try... the avocado one is the best!  The corn tamales are a must; the cream that comes with it is OMG sooo goood!...  I think it's sour cream and butter mixed together.   OH, and if you add the two together... the avocado salsa and the cream...  OH WOW!!  I put on everything I ate...mmmmmm.

Chips are decent w/the trio of Salsas they offer which are pretty good. Service was fast and definitely not a problem. The drinks are super pricy though- so just eat and get your free drinks on the casino floor. Plate of tacos(3 tacos+ rice+beans) and a corona was ~$16. Just a little in the \"ouch\" department on the budget!",

I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican by ANY means, but this place sure delivered on taste.  First off, they bring out various salsas and chips. All were very delicious and flavorful.  I had the chicken enchiladas for my entree. Not much to say but it was tasty enough that I didn't leave a drop on my plate. That and all the other entrees were fairly reasonable also-$10-12 a pop. However, one thing stands out the most about this place is the oh-so-strong margaritas! I definitely recommend getting them and hey, if you don't finish yours, you can always take it to go! I love Las Vegas liquor laws!  One minus-it's located inside the Hard Rock hotel off the strip, making it difficult to get to without driving to it.",

Since I was in Vegas for work and didn't have time to f*ck around getting grub, I ate here twice during my Vegas work week since I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel (where this PT is located).  On my first visit the service sucked... I had to wait forever to get a menu and I was only able to order because a waitress who wasn't assigned to my area was nice enough to deal with me.  I ordered the Baja fish tacos (natch) and they were rather light on the fish.  Pink Taco ain't no Rubio's, but at least even they couldn't f*ck up a Corona.  The second time I ate there the service was better.. My co-workers and I happened to venture in during Happy Hour, which meant 2-for-1 beers and appetizers.  Not bad... I once again ordered the Baja fish tacos and they were still rather light on the fish.. but since we were paying via an expense account they did the job.  Pink Taco is like the chicks you see in Vegas:  Attractive in that slutty, tramp stamp way that makes a Motley Crue song relevant, but not something I'd pay for with my own money at home.",

Half off select apps and 2 for 1 margaritas (rocks, not blended, hollerrrr!)... after sight-seeing all day with a couple drinks in hand, nibbles and tequila ALWAYS sound like a hit to me. The love and I shared things like the appetizer platter (sweet corn tamales, chicken and steak skewers, cheese quesadilla and taquitos), the chicken nachos (my absolute fave) and the queso bean dip (don't judge us, we were drunk and starving!). The chips and three different types of salsa were always welcomed with open arms... I could probably be happy eating just those. The bartenders were friendly and on it with the refills (which is a MUST for happy hour, otherwise that's a not-so-happy hour for me). Is this somewhere I would pick to eat while sober or not staying at the hotel? Probably not. Was it a lifesaver while staying at the Hard Rock? Undeniably. Hence, four stars. Should I stay at the Hard Rock again, I can see me sitting up at the bar, playing that video blackjack with a margarita in hand and chips sticking out of my mouth. (there may or may not be a picture in existence that holds True to that imagery....)",

Friend has never been to Pink Taco so OBVI we HAVE to go here! Chicken Tostada Salad is on my mind! We order. Of course I get the salad and I believe he ordered the PINK TACOS and we also got some chips and salsa and guacamole!  The guacamole and the salsa were SO ON POINT!! I LOOOOVED the salsa! I could have drank it!  Of course my tostada salad was just as amazing as I remember it from years ago and his pink tacos were AIIGHT.  Friend did enjoy the place though and agreed that it was DELICIOUS! Especially the tostada salad!! NOM FREAKIN' NOM!!",

It wasn't very crowded, so we were able to get seated right away.  The chips and salsa were good. They were warm and not too greasy. I enjoyed their salsa. It was a pico with a medium spice. Suitable for any tolerance level.  For my main course I went with the lobster tacos. I think this should just be called lobster with some tortillas. I was expecting actual tacos, but instead I got a lobster tail with beans and rice. The tail itself was a pretty good portion, but there was little flavor to anything else. I did like the fluffiness of their house made tortillas, but again, not worth the $18 price tag and I was still hungry afterwards.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their enchilada dishes, maybe I should have gone that route. But even from looking at them, I don't think they were worth the $12-$15 price tags.  Service was good. We had someone filling up our drinks and checking in on us constantly. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I think are better and worth the money, so I probably wont be back.",

I sat on the patio by the pool.  Nice murals on the walls and pillars. It was nice under the covering with the rain coming down.   After looking at their menu. I ordered water with lemon to drink. Two pink tacos and one crunchy shrimp taco with an order of the zonked fries. I told Bianca that I don't like onions or tomatoes. She made sure that I didn't have any pico. She was awesome! She forgot my lemon though. :(  Ok so I wish I could say the same about the food. On my pink tacos the only part that had a faint touch of dirty pink was the edges. Both of my pink tacos fell apart so I was had to eat the guts with a fork. Even with the salsa the tacos lacked flavor. The crispy shrimp tacos weren't crispy and were a huge disappointment. The fries aren't fries it's huge wedges of slightly undercooked potatoes covered with some cheese, sauce and some carne asada. I wasn't impressed especially when I got to the under done wedge.  The potatoes are too big to enjoy the other flavors of everything.   If you want the fun ambiance this is a good spot. The food needs some work.",

I had a chicken sandwich which I saw on the video monitor outside, and it did not disappoint; it was full of flavor; you can taste the lime in every bite; very rich and flavorful.

Just was not that good. I ordered three tacos. Those did taste good. One of our friends ordered a burrito with the avocado crema sauce. He said there was not any creama on his burrito.

When attempts were made to report the multiple cases of food poisoning in our party, we were met with rudeness and zero sympathy. The manager did not seem to care or be worried about other customers getting sick. Instead, we were told that have to go to the hospital to prove that we had food poisoning, when multiple people in the group are physicians and know how to diagnosis food poisoning. DO NOT GO HERE.

The Rock Hard margarita was reallllllly sweet, a little too sweet for me but probably good if you're into that. It even came with a garnish of rock candy. My friends and I ordered the pitcher and it definitely could have been stronger. The chips and salsa were good. I ordered the Pink Tacos and although this place is pricy, I left full. It came with 3 tacos, rice and beans. The chicken had a nice flavor to it but the tortillas were a little soggy. One of my friends swears by the shrimp tacos here and another ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas which were tasty and flavorful but did not come out sizzling as fajitas should.   Overall I'm not sure I would make this a regular stop on my Vegas trips because of the prices but I'm glad I tried it.",

I had a feeling we were in trouble when the hostess gave us the regular menu instead of the Brunch menu. When we asked our waitress about it, she acted like we were putting her out.  We ended up ordering off the regular menu, which might have been our mistake.   The Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Peppers were the first and only good thing we had. They were Crispy, Salty, Cheesy, Crunchy and slightly Spicy. A good sign for the start of our meal. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. We also ordered at least one of each of their tacos. I can't tell you much about them because they all tasted the same.  In a word...bland! It's pretty bad when we couldn't tell the difference between Al Pastor, Al Carbon, Garden and even their namesake Pink Taco. Even the Tortillas were bland and doughy. The Shrimp and fish tacos were identifiable, but not much more. The Rice and Beans and Chips and Salsa jumped right on the same Bland Bandwagon.   Even our Margaritas missed the mark. My Cadillac had an off, bitter taste and Diane's Kinky B*tch tasted like A shot of the liqueur by itself. Needless to say, there was nothing about our visit to Pink Taco that would make us want to return.",

Casual and neon lights. After our flight we were starving and decided to have lunch here. I love street tacos and the sight of the pink tortillas was a big draw for me. We ordered Zonkey Fries, and numerous tacos.   The Zonkey fries were steak fries topped with carne asada and cheese and pico. Very good was to start our meal off! The tacos come in orders of 3, 6 or 9. The pink tacos are their specialty consisting of black beans, grilled chicken, salsa arbol, pickled onion and avocado inside their signature pink corn tortilla. They tasted very good, I love seeing something so pretty before I eat it and that was what it was. The flavor was good, but the visual was more appealing. Recommend it! We also had an order of the Al Pastor tacos, which was rotisserie pork topped with pineapple salsa in a regular corn tortilla. This was also a good choice for us. Tasty! Recommend it if you are in the Hard Rock Hotel!",

The chips and salsa were delicious and I almost killed myself eating them. Everyone ordered tacos but me. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito. It was really good but I would get the taco plate next time.   It's a cool casual atmosphere and I'm looking forward to trying what they are known for next time, tacos of course.",

    "text": "We ate at Pink Taco more than once during our stay in the Hard Rock Hotel. I love their Margaritas, but I wouldn't call their food authentic Mexican food. It's too Americanized for me. Their Pink Taco was good. The Beef Fajitas was okay. They all lack the spiciness I prefer, but I guess one can add more hot sauce or spicy salsa in each dish. Still, the place got jammed with patrons, and the line was way outside the waiting area. Out of the 1,400 attendees to our convention, we definitely brought a lot of foot traffic here because we all love Mexican food. In fact, it's a place that grows on you. It surely did on me, because I kept coming back for more chips and salsa. HaHa! The service is great: attentive and courteous. You should visit and try them if you haven't been. Not sure if they will be around after the hotel gets a big renovation. Hopefully, the people working there will still get hired with new management.",

I asked for black beans because I can't have pork and they brought out refried beans. I expressed my concern and a new bowl of black beans were brought out. Didn't offer to remake anything. You guys should take dietary restrictions more seriously. The pink chips in the chips and salsa were cute. I probably wouldn't come back.",

I advise against sitting right near the patio indoors as you will alertnate from hot to cold every 2 minutes or so.  The place has a nice vibe and has a cool open kitchen where you can watch the tortillas being made.  I ate at Pink Taco twice on a recent visit to the Hard Rock.  First time for happy hour and again for a team lunch.  The food was much better when we ordered off the menu - it was fresh and tasty.  The lunch was a little less refined and presentation was a little on the sloppy side.  Tacos are small so order a few.  The beans and rice were a let down - I'd try a salad next time.  The guac and salsa were both pretty good and make for a great snack if you are just getting drinks.  Prices weren't terrible and were certainly cheaper than resorts on the strip.  If you have a hankering for Mexican and are at the Hard Rock then check this place out.",

Then when asked for the bill to be split up, she responded with \"Well they asked for it all together\" (referring to the other two people in our party), then walked away. We had to flag her down again and she approached us saying \"So how do you want the check\",  I had simply asked for it to be separate, then she responded to me saying \"Well I'm asking them\" (referring to the other two people in my party) and rolled her eyes. I have never received service poorer or ruder than the service I received tonight. I am extremely disappointed that Pink Taco would allow employees to be that rude to their customers!",

Service was friendly and quick without any chance of missing the show.  Of course they bring out complimentary chips and salsa for the table, but we still had to try their Zonkey Nachos.  Wonderful coverage of toppings that include guajillo sauce, queso, black beans, jalapenos, guac, sour cream and pico.  You can add chicken or carne asada but we opted out.  These nachos are great on their own and easily sharable. Nacho lovers like myself enjoyed these immensely.    Since there were 3 of us, their Street Tacos include 3! Perfect.  Plus you can order different options for the tacos.  My friends opted to try the famous Pink Taco as I opted for the Carne Asada.  All of us enjoyed our choices.  My taco had great flavor with the pico and cojita cheese.  Next time I will try the Pink Taco I promise.    Since it was my birthday, the waitress brought out a birthday surprise of their churros with ice cream on top.  So happy I was able to enjoy this tasty treat.  I would order these over and over again.    I plan on returning without hesitation.",

Not sure if it's that pink pickled onion or the pink tortilla, or the beer next to it, but they go down great!

    "text": "The wife and I went to Pink Taco for dinner before heading to the Wednesday night Nine Inch Nails show at the Joint.  With the exception of Nobu and Mr. Lucky's, Pink Taco is likely the longest running restaurant in the Hard Rock.  Unfortunately, the food, the drinks, and the overall experience have seemingly been untouched by the passage of time.  I had the Pork Chili Verde ($14) and the wife had the Chicken Tinga Enchiladas ($13).  I liked my entree, a tasty if otherwise unremarkable braised pork in a flavorful green chile sauce, better than she did hers.  There was a small service slip as a food runner delivered my wife's correct entree, but with refried beans instead of her requested black beans.  The error was corrected promptly by our server.  We both had margaritas.  I had the Golden Cadillac and the wife had the Pink Cadillac.  Our drinks were fine, but nothing noteworthy other than their price.  Surprisingly (or perhaps not surprising at all), our drinks were more expensive than our food ($15 and $14, respectively).  In my opinion, though, they were a little overpriced even by Vegas standards.  On the whole, the food and drink was pretty standard Tex-Mex with a Vegas resort markup.  Pink Taco wasn't bad nor was it exceptional.  It was pretty much exactly what it has been since its inception.  As such, it has gone a bit stagnant, stale, and easily forgettable.  There are plenty of other places in town doing the essentially the same food and drink, but doing it better and at a better price.",

I love the flavor of the salsa that comes with the complimentary chips to start the meal. The Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos are delicious. It's hard to go wrong with bacon, loads of cheese, and jalapenos. The Zonkey Nachos are huge and were more than enough for three of us to share as an appetizer. We all loved the flavor of the sauce on the nachos and that the toppings were evenly covering the nachos. I could make a meal of just the nachos.  On my first visit the tacos didn't wow me. They weren't bad, but not the best tacos I've ever had. On my most recent visit I had Our Famous Pink Taco and thought it was delicious. The taco was a little on the greasy side, but everything in the taco worked well together. Our waitress said tacos could be mixed and matched. I'd recommend getting this as one of three tacos since it's on the heavy side.   The Churro dessert was so yummy! It was served as churro bites filled with caramel and topped with a nice scoop of ice cream. Our waitress overheard us talking about my friend's birthday and later appeared with a complimentary and delicious dessert. Nice touch!",

    "text": "When a restaurant is \"cleverly\" named the \"Pink Taco\", I'm kind of expecting the lowest common denominator when it comes to food....so color me pleasantly surprised on the visit I had here. I went to the Hard Rock to visit my old Army bud who was in town and at the last minute he tells me he wants to go to Echo & Rig. Yeah on a Friday that's not going to happen without resos so we stayed in house and went to the Pink Taco.  There was a short line to get in but another set of friends got here before we did and secured us a table so in we went. We sat down and got two baskets of chips and salsa. My biggest weakness at Mexican restaurants are freshly fried casera chips and salsa. The ones at the Pink Taco are top shelf. The salsa was outstanding.  Minor annoyance. We arrived for happy hour but according to their policy on a day there is a concert at the Hard Rock, well, there's no happy hour. Interesting. Plus our waitress failed to tell us this before our friends went to the bar for drinks so they came back to the table not happy.  For my entree order I got the Zonkey Burrito wet with al pastor. I was shocked by how good it was. Now, the al pastor was tough enough that I would have mistaken it for carne asada but man it was overall flavorful and delicious. Inside the burrito was meaty with some pico and the red sauce was outstanding. I would definitely get this again. Our server was very cool even though someone in our party was a bit intoxicated and needed an extra bit of patience. Overall, other than the happy hour snafu I've got nothing bad to say about the Pink Taco. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was fun and the service was good. I'd go again which is the highest compliment I can give a place.",

The pink chips are a cute touch.  + PORK TAMALES ($14): Even though you can get a whole bag of tamales that taste just like these from Costco for about the same price, this plate is probably the best bang for your buck. Two tamales with a side of rice and beans really hit the spot, and it was so comforting.   + GUACAMOLE ($9): Jesus, did they use cruelty-free, free range avocados to have it cost so much?? I didn't order this, but my friend was totally caught off guard once the bill came in. The serving is not that big, and it does taste good, but...$9 for that?  = S E R V I C E = Service was excellent! Our waitress was friendly, and answered all my questions.

The inside decor reminds me of when you mistakenly walk into a bar on a tourist trap street. If you squint really really hard, hey you're in Mexico!  The tacos were good, nothing fancy.

I had the carne asada tacos and I tried one of the shrimp tacos, both were very tasty. I'd definitely go back if I'm craving some Mexican food.

Even more unique is that although it is a soft taco, the shell has a slightly crispy exterior.  It's hard to describe, the lightly crisp exterior adds a great texture to the overall flavor of the taco, but it is nothing like a standard taco shell.  The chicken in the taco is balanced out with the flavor of the pickled red onion.  I never thought pickled red onion would be in a taco, but I'm glad it is.  What a fabulous flavor!  By the way, you do get 3 tacos per order.  You can get refried beans and spanish rice added to your order for another $4.  Free chips and salsa are good as well, but you will enjoy the pink tacos.",

I ate here twice while working on a production at The Joint in the Hard Rock.    The items I do actually like a lot: the salsa, the ceviche, the guacamole, and the fruit salad.  Those are all worth snacking on if you're there for a few drinks and light food.   The tuna tacos are okay but a little bland, and the fish tacospretty flavorless too.  Mostly the rest of the food is bland.  When I say \"bland\", I don't mean salt-free; I mean just cardboard-flavor-like.  The refried beans taste canned, and the rice is just run-of-the-mill \"blah\".  None of the entrees really tasted that great, and other than a fun atmosphere and snacking, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again for the prices they're charging vs. the quality.   Honestly, I'd rather eat at Mr. Lucky's inside the Hard Rock any time over Pink Taco.",

The meat had no taste to it whatsoever!! No seasonings. It was completely unflavorful! I didn't even eat all 3 tacos. My boyfriends chicken was covered with a bunch of leaves. Maybe to try and hide how bad the chicken lacked in flavoring? Maybe it was a bad night. I don't know. But for $58, worst meal I've had in Vegas.  My stomach is still paying the price for it this morning. I gave 2 stars cuz the chicken taquitos at least we're good!",

Their nachos are ok but a bit of a rip off considering the price.  $4 extra if you want steak or chicken on them.  Their burrito is alright but there isn't really anything in it besides steak, beans, and rice.  They put this weird sour cream on top and put the lettuce on top as well.  It's a bit bland and tasteless really.  Their chips and salsa are alright but also a bit bland.  The salsa is too watered down.  I had an interview here as well and the manager only hires girls to be servers.  Every girl that would go up to be interviewed he had some creepy smile on his face.  Then again, what else do you really expect in Vegas?  Anyway, the food is a rip off considering its Mexican food which is extremely cheap to make in a restaurant but that's just Vegas prices.  I don't know if there is a trick here with their sides or extras like at Lucky's.  I haven't been here in a few weeks because it's so overpriced.",

First things first, its a little dark in here which is fine.....BUT, they had black menu's with tiny white writing so it was difficult to read. We started off with the chips and salsa (it was free). The chips could have been much better and so could the salse. They bring out 3 different warm salsa's. We didn't like any of them and decided to order regular pico de gallo w/ guac. The guac was really good. I asked for a lemon to add a little more of a zing to it and it was yummo!!  I had the chicken taco plate. The chicken had a weird flavor, like a hint of chocolate or something...my tortillas were soggy underneath, I couldn't pick up my taco without it ripping and falling through. The rice and beans were very salty, and I love salt....so that should say it all.   I wasn't happy with my meal at all. So I called the manager and told her my frustrations. She told me that \"the tortillas get soggy because they are kept in a warmer then put on the glass plate, causing steam... in the end softening the tortilla\" She took the combo off the tab.  So basically, for a soda, guac and salsa.....I Paid 13.87  I wouldn't recommed...",

The nachos were good, but everything else was blah. The location also isn't pretty as the LA one. The Nachos and customer service earned three star because everything else sucked.",

    "text": "I'd just like to start off by saying I came to Vegas celebrating my birthday with a large group of family this past weekend. We had heard great things about this restaurant and since we were staying at the Hard Rock hotel, we figured, why not? Arriving to the hotel from a long drive, my group and I were beyond hungry. As expected at a restaurant on a Friday night, we did expect a wait to get seated and for the food to take some time. First off, we had waited about forty-five minutes to more than an hour to receive our food. But before receiving any plates on the table, we had asked our waitress how much longer we had before our food came out. No reply or acknowledgment. The waitress ignored at least three of my cousins who asked and walked away. We kept waiting with our growling tummies until another cousin of mine walked in to ask another waitress. That same waitress spoke to her manager and from reading the manager's lips, he said \"fuck it.\" Whatever that meant, it confused some of us. Soon after, another waitress who apparently was a manager herself barged in to our sitting area to check out what the issue was. We told her and responded with, \"Smile, youre in Vegas.... bitch.\" Regardless whether you're in Vegas, New York City or Los Angeles, there is no need to wait over an hour for mediocre food. Or to even receive that type of attitude/service. Mind you, when the food was finally sent out, it tasted as if they warmed it up in the microwave. End of story, horrible service, mediocre food, poor management. Pink taco needs to step it up, \"you're in Vegas!\"",

Along with the free chips and salsa, 2 people will be stuffed for slightly over what you'd pay at Taco Bell.  If you want to splurge, get 2 for 1 margaritas, and now you're stuffed and drunk.

The service is always terribly slow to get helped by a waiter, so expect to be waiting awhile.  Once you order though, the food is up almost instantly.

I chose a standard blended margarita at a ridiculous 13 bucks.  It was like a ten oz slushy with not much alcohol served in a standard bar glass.  For a 13 dollar margarita, I guess I was expecting something bigger, maybe presented in a cool way.  I ordered grilled fish tacos and they were fishy tasting and mushy.  Not even tasty, another disappointment.  My Bf ordered chile verde.  They brought him a cereal bowl sized portion of it which was cold to the touch.  It was obviously something meant to be microwaved, because it definitely was not freshly prepared.  The waiter apologized and disappeared and brought the same bowl back ten minutes later.  It had obviously been warmed again in the microwave because now it was too hot to touch.    The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal, as they were frequently replenished.    Our meal was nearly 200 bucks for the 6 of of......NOT WORTH IT!",

The tacos were ok nothing great. I am from california and we have some killer mexican food. The theme \"pink taco\" was entertaining but that was really not that entertaining. The wait staff was rude and not very attentive.",

They were warm & had a soft crunch. I am not a salsa eater, so have no opinion on that.  We shared the sampler appetizer. Overall it was fine, although the chicken was cold. I sure did like the little sweet tamales! The appetizer was just enough food to not weigh us down, so we could move on to the next destination.",

Doing something like this anywhere can get expensive quick - doing this in Las Vegas can break the freakin' bank in no time flat. This is one of the best venues I found. The food is not mind blowing but it is good. The restaurant is located inside the Hard Rock hotel which is fun and very close to the strip. So all and all this is a fun bar that serves decent food at reasonable prices. Great for groups. Good services and great party planning services.",

We also take a little stroll around the casino after we eat and see some of the cool memorabilia. Anyway, Pink Taco...I love the decorations and the vibe and the food is awesome. Tonight my husband had the carnitas and said it was the best he'd ever had. I had the Pink Tacos (without chicken since I'm a vegetarian) and a cheese enchilada. It was hands down the very best enchilada I have ever had. I don't know why or how but it was just off the charts good. The pickled onions on the pink taco are reason alone to go there. Everything we have had there is highly craveable. The chips are super fresh and the tortillas are made in house. Tonight the Adult Entertainment Expo is at the Hard Rock so it also made for some excellent porn star people watching. Yay Pink Taco!!!",

My sister got the Blue Ballz margarita, which she loved, despite the super strange name that you don't really feel like saying aloud to your server.   Hot chips & salsa were delivered to our table almost immediately, and they were delicious. We both got taco trios a la carte, and I got the corn as well, which was BOMB. They were out of the corn on the cob so they offered me corn off the cob with the same toppings, which was actually better - consider asking for it that way! Less messy!  My favorite taco was the al carbon with steak. The al pastor with pineapple salsa was good, and the pink taco was yummy but I was too full to finish it.   This + Culinary Dropout are the best restaurants in the hotel if you're looking to stay casual and just relax. And by \"stay casual\" I mean we showed up in our sweats and only felt a tiny bit judged.",

There are a number of beers, margaritas, sangria, shots and other decent (Jack) well drinks available for $5 and a few foodstuffs for $5-9. Running from 3-7pm M-F, there's sufficient time to get tequila crazy in this joint. Even with the cold(er) weather outside and the large doors that lead to the pool closed, the vibe is still fun and will lead to an extended session of getting sauced.   From the menu, I tasted the honey-chipotle wings (a nice sweet glaze with smokey ranch. Make sure you tell them to cook the wings to a crispy well done), the Diablo nachos (not as spicy as you would expect, but still good) and some guacamole (solid). Sure, you can't really go wrong with these orders, but they were perfect for the occasion.    All in all, my party of three stayed for 2+ hours and left full (and dirty drunk) for $150 including tax and tip. Not a bad outing.",

While eating dinner at Pink Taco, my husband was verbally attacked by a drunk patron at the gaming area in the bar & the restaurant manager did not call security, which forced us to get up & leave. We also informed hotel management who did nothing.   It is very unlikely we will stay here again, unless something is done by HRH to earn our business back. We flew in for this weekend away & it was very disappointing that you allow good customers & gaming players to be treated in this manner.",

Quality meat.  Salsa: I'm a lightweight and like Gringo salsa, not too spicy, not HOT.   Burrito was excellent. Good sauce. Full of meat. Cheesy goodness.   My husband loved the fajitas at PT. I thought they were pretty good too. Lots of veggies not spicy and the chicken was  moist and not over grilled.  Service was good.  One star minus for over priced margaritas. I know its Vegas though. ...  In conclusion a good place with good food. Not sure I like pink  food coloring though.",

I have had not so great service at times and at other times really great service. I love their outdoor patio seating, with a view of the pool, provides a nice atmosphere with the palm trees and is great for people watching!   I have tried a many things here, and have narrowed it down to a few favorites.... the chicken nachos are great, they have real cheese and cheese sauce....YUMM! (the diablo nachos are good as well, but beware- they are spicy!) The taquitos are very good- I prefer the shredded chicken over the beef, and the bacon wrapped jalapenos are great- definitely give them a try!",

My husband ordered the Zonkey Nachos and I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The homemade tortillas served with my fajitas were absolutely amazing! My shrimp was sweet and Smokey and perfectly spicy. All the fajita ingredients were seasoned and cooked perfectly and we both enjoyed all of our food.   I ordered a virgin pina colada just for fun and it was very delicious. It was served with fresh blueberries on top with complimented the creamy drink very well. We will happily return to this restaurant!",

    "text": "My, what a few years and different chefs can do!!  I was here for Restaurant Week in 2011.  Pink Taco remains one of the original restaurants at the Hard Rock.  Chefs Bradley Manchester and Mickey Hardin have created a number of new dishes with others that have been on the menu before.  Four of us tried:  House made chips and salsa Churro brioche filled with dulce de leche Chorizo cornbread Tres leches cinnamon roll Avocado mollete Albondiga with chorizo and beef Aguachiles with shrimp, octopus, Serrano chiles, avocado, cucumber and onions Cinnamon sugar doughnuts with chocolate mousse Garlic shrimp with tortillas Tres leches pancakes Chilaquiles Pork chile verde Benedict Mole tots with cilantro Chocolate flan Pineapple cake with horchata ice cream  My standouts were the brioche, cornbread, aguachiles, garlic shrimp, pork chile verde Benedict and the two desserts.  The brioche is so sweet with the dulce de leche that you can't resist it!  What a great flavor!  The chorizo cornbread with jalapenos, zucchini, and cotija cheese is fantastic.  The aguachiles is a very flavorful mix of shrimp and octopus with chiles and vegetables that is a great ceviche. Of course for me, the two desserts finishing our meal were very good.  I'm not sure how long Pink Taco will be open as the Hard Rock transitions to the Virgin name.  I hope it styas as good as it is right now!",

    "text": "Although Bradley Manchester has been hard at work with the transition to Virgin Hotels, that has not stopped he and Mickey Harden from coming up with some new ideas across the building currently called Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, and at Pink Taco on Saturday morning several items made their debut alongside some old favorites.  A part of Las Vegas for nearly twenty-five years, the California import now old enough to be considered iconic, Pink Taco resides just steps from The Joint and is the only Restaurant besides Nobu that remains since the property on Paradise opened, its self-applied description as a \"hipster Mexican Cantina\" underselling what is actually a space that doesn't take itself too seriously despite turning out bold and frequently authentic flavors.   Large in size, and best during warm months when the party spills over onto an outdoor patio, it is after making way past a Tortilla stone, kitchen and bar that guest find themselves immersed in Mexican folk-art, everything from skeletons to cherubs surrounding while music plays overhead at a reasonable volume.  The rare place still serving complimentary Chips and Salsa, both housemade and setting a high standard, fans of Tequila will likely find themselves drawn to Cocktails with risque names and pronounced sweetness, the \"Horchata Colada\" taking an alternative approach with Cinnamon Rum and performing beautifully alongside Pastry Chef Harden's new Churro Brioche with a creamy Dulce de Leche core.  Acting as a sounding board for much of the meal, the reservation not accidentally made on a day when Chefs Harden and Manchester were both present to assist Pink Taco's Chef de Cuisine with new plates soon to join Brunch or Happy Hour, guests not counting carbohydrates will be excited to know that Mickey quietly continues to prove himself as one of Sin City's best Pastry Chefs with two additional Appetizers, Cornbread hot from a skillet riddled with Chorizo plus added moisture from Zucchini, and a Cinnamon Roll topped in Cream, Cajeta and Berries riffs on the flavor of Tres Leches Cake without the sogginess that many find off-putting.  Not ignoring patrons seeking healthier fare, all three Chefs currently pursuing their own fitness goals, guests who cannot get enough Avocado Toast should strongly consider the new vegetarian Mollete additionally featuring Refried Beans and housemade Salsa while those following keto can find big flavors and nothing off-limits in tender Meatballs topped in smoky Sauce or Aguachiles indistinguishable from what one might find south of the border save for their slightly lower spot on the Scoville scale.  Back to Mickey for a moment, his Cinnamon-Sugar Donuts with Abuelita Mousse toying with the idea of Mexican Hot Chocolate and outperforming the fresh-made rounds one will find at Fractured Prune or even Delmonico Steakhouse, it is through considerable effort that Pink Taco's most impressive new plate delivers boldly flavored Shrimp cooked in Butter fortified by Shells and Garlic, each bite dazzling from the fork and even better when nestled in a Corn Tortilla hot off the stone.  Impressed by the veracity of flavors from Veracruz to the Yucatan, Chef Manchester's affinity for the area no secret to those who follow him on Social Media, another new plate delivers slowly braised Pork as a Benedict, the English Muffin perhaps better replaced by Bolillo or Sopes as they do at Broken Yolk Cafe, while Chilaquiles served wet and Tater Tots topped in housemade Mole plus fried Peanuts each offer textural rollercoasters that are best shared given their substantial portion-sizes.  Not afraid to both start and finish sweet, though prices lower than portions or quality might suggest already had several diners over-sated, it should go without saying that Pink Taco's buttery Tres Leches Pancakes topped with Fried Ice Cream are a must while new items including Choco-Flan and Pineapple Cake that eats like a Financier amidst the flavors of a Pina Colada are each \"works in progress\" that already best other Mexican Desserts served throughout town.  FIVE STARS:  Intentionally inauthentic, but simultaneously embracing flavors and techniques that continue to please guests from a variety of backgrounds, Pink Taco has been doing things the right way ever since Bradley Manchester took over as Hard Rock Hotel & Casino's Executive Chef and the new menu shows he, Mickey Harden and the current kitchen staff have no intention of pumping the breaks until Hard Rock temporarily shutters in 2020 to make way for Virgin.",

    "text": "Aside from the colorful decor with a festive feel, the rest of our experience here was quite disappointing. We are staying at a hotel across the street from Hard Rock, and after the long drive, getting back in the car didn't have great appeal.  We walked over, found the restaurant, and got seated in short order.  I'd read that they have some seating out by the pool.  Wrong. The hostess said they are doing renovations out there, so no al fresco dining.  Strike one.  The bus boy brought a basket of fresh chips and a bowl of salsa.  That happened quickly, but he wasn't in charge of bringing waters, evidently. That had to wait for our server.  She came after a while. We ordered our beverages and our entrees at the same time.  Drinks came reasonably quickly.  My virgin lime margarita looked great, but was enough to cause a sugar OD.  I ended up cutting it with water several times.  At $5, it was an okay value, just too cloyingly sweet. Our nephew ordered lemonade, which looked like it came from a fountain.  Not freshly squeezed here. Strike two.  Worst of all - the food was very mediocre.  Dear Hubby ordered fish tacos.  He said they were okay; a little bland, but a good texture.  He didn't realize when the server offered rice and beans that it was an upsell - they don't come automatically.  At $4, it wasn't a great deal, on top of paying for the tacos.  My nephew and I split an order of fajitas.  I've never had fajitas arrive at the table that weren't sizzling before.  I can attest - if they're not emitting steam and making the signature sound of warm food meeting hot skillet, they won't be at their peak. These weren't at a peak of flavor or temperature. There were only 2 tortillas offered; very chintzy!  Strike three.  The waitress never came back to ask how are food was / did we need anything else. Had she, I probably would have sent the meal back for a re-do.  Also, no spoons were on the table, nor came with the meal.  That made it awkward to serve up the ingredients. If strike four was a thing, they reached it.  Overall, quite disappointing. I would recommend trying other options for Mexican food.  Not the fun start to our two days in Vegas that we'd hoped for, sadly.",

Not enough tortillas for my liking. 3 big ones, I'd prefer a few smaller ones. For the mains we had the Pink Tacos and the chicken enchiladas mole. Pink tacos were full and very tasty. Enchiladas were awesome, mole sauce had a nice chocolate flavor without it being overpowering. Service was good, quick and efficient. Place has a nice vibe, had a really good time.

I had the shrimp enchiladas they were great.  The suiza sauce had great flavor.  The rice was tasty.  The beans a little dry.  Did the value outweigh the cost? That's a close and tough call considering how expensive food is as of late.  The menu was old as in aged, and some of the writing was smeared off from wear.  It had seen better days. New menus would enhance the experience.  The bartender...I didn't catch his name was a cool cat who recommended the shrimp enchiladas, he was a great server.  He refilled my Sprite numerous times and prepared me a Sprite \"To Go\" in a plastic cup with ice and a damn paper straw.  I think I posted a couple pics.  If not I'll see if I can soon.",

We decided to eat in house.  Atmosphere - Typical Mexican restaurant.  Things that stood out was the kitchen was open, and in the corner was a lady making fresh tortillas.  Food   Drink - Pacifico Clara, a Mexican beer.  I wish they had some craft Mexican beer.    Dinner - A burrito and you can get it wet for not additional coast.  I had the pork burrito and the thing was huge.  I did order the burrito wet, Christmas style.  So half was covered in red sauce and green.  The red was a great chipotle style while the green was fresh and zesty.  The burrito was stuffed with a ton of pork and the fillers was minimal.  Service - What you need from a waitress.  Future - Yes.",

They tasted good and crunchy but I needed some salt on them and there wasn't any at the table. I guess I didn't need it I just wanted it - so it's better that way no need for extra water retention on vacation.   We chose to sit outside on their patio and I enjoyed the ambiance very much. It was relaxed and people were having a good time.  The decor is day of the dead and outside it was under pink lighting (hence the not too great pics) It was only slightly chilly on this November night in Vegas, but they had heaters outside that kept us perfectly comfortable.   I ordered a carne Asada quesadilla and my husband had a fried pork burrito. They were both satisfying and the price was about $30.00 with no drinks which is about average for a not fine dining Vegas dinner with no drinks.  My quesadilla had perfect cheese to meat ratio.  Service was good friendly and attentive.   We would like to go back to try happy hour while we are here :)",

For dinner, I ordered the pink tacos which were decent, but I've had better tacos. Given this is a  hotel restaurant though they weren't half bad.   I'm docking stars solely based on the service and not really the food. The waitress was extremely slow - took her almost 15 min to bring our drinks after we ordered them. We also sat for another 15 min after we finished eating for her to bring the bill. I'm typically not one to complain about service either, but she was just so slow!",

Asada was dry and rice and beans were very bland so I took my own advice and this time ordered the fajitas! Our waitress, Angie, was great!!! She told us we could do half chicken and half steak for the fajitas!! (When she came to take our order we couldn't decide at first) The fajitas were SO FLAVORFUL!!!! They come with a little side or rice and beans topped with guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes. They may have changed their rice and beans because this time they were definitely not bland! They tasted super good!!! We also ordered churros for dessert! They were the perfect amount of sweet for my sweet tooth!!! And the almond toffee pieces provided a great crunch! The creme anglaise had the perfect texture!! So glad we ordered it and so glad we came back! Thanks Pink Taco!!",

    "text": "Mmm pink taco. Wait a second.... What a disgusting name. You know a MAN started this business!  Anywho, after a long morning of drinking at the beautiful Hard Rock pools, one needs to recharge and refuel themselves for the obnoxious amount of drinking that will occur later that evening. Pink Taco is a fun place to run into for lunch for a decent meal. With a name like Pink Taco, you know that everything is going to be just a little hyper sexualized.... Oh and the menus are pink and glittery. Sold.  I'm a huge fan of the Chicken Tostada Salad... Crispy romaine lettuce with grilled chicken, avocado chunks, black beans and some really good chipotle dressing. I've also tasted a few of the other dishes my friends got. I like my salad more but it was still tasty... or maybe I was just too tipsy to really care. Look it's obviously not going to be authentic Mexican food so don't harp on that. Many things in Vegas are not authentic. You would know this if you took a look at some of the \"women\" on the outskirts of the strip... yeah, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  Overall I think Pink Taco is a fun place for lunch in the hotel that isn't that overpriced! I've never been for dinner or happy hour but whenever I walk by at night it looks like a wild party inside. Oh and keep a look out for coupons or specials online. The last time I was there these two guys gave us their coupon so we got our meal at 50% off! Woot woot.",

The service was great, waitress came over almost immediately for our drink order and was quick to bring them back, along with the hot chips and salsa.  We had the steak quesadilla appetizer to start. I opted for the taco trio, 2 were the Pink tacos and I tried one crispy shrimp (which was my favorite).  They look small, but I could barely finish all 3 so don't be turned off by the size. My husband did the trio as well, the Al Carbon with steak. He's not normally a Mexican food fan, but he enjoyed his  as well and added the rice and beans.  Overall the service was great, wasn't to pricey, and the food was definitely good.  My only reason for 4 stars was the table was very small and cramped, my legs were touching the bottom and I was afraid my husband wouldn't even be able to sit there. I also would have liked to have seen a better beer selection, a few craft options would haven been nice. These weren't deal breakers however, if we ever go back, we will wait for a larger table and perhaps drink some margaritas instead!",

We got chips and salsa. They didn't have pico de gallo, but they did have 3 different sauces to try. It was mediocre, would've been better with pico de gallo though.   We wanted to have room left over for dessert so we decided to split the appetizer platter which included sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole. It was more than enough for both of us and it was all really tasty.   After our food, we ordered fried ice cream and Churros  dusted with cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate cream. Both were to die for!  I had a nice time here. I'd love to come back.",

    "text": "Part of the reason I was going to Vegas was to go on Foursquare badge hunts. These hunts proved to be more difficult than what I wanted and Steven grew more annoyed with me as I did my badge chasing. I found out about Pink Taco off of the Foursquare website as a valid check in to getting the Hard Rock Hotel badge. Not only were we staying right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel but the idea that they might be serving pink tacos peaked my interest. One thing I simply love about Las Vegas is that it truly is a city that never sleeps and stores and restaurants are open to the farthest reaches of the night. Pink Taco is no exception. The night we went it was just about to get busy and lengthy waits for a table were about to ensue. We squeezed in just the nick of time.  Once we got seated we had some pretty delicious chips and salsa to eat. At times it seemed like the waiter was spread too thin and there were about two times when we were wondering if we would ever see him again. He forgot our silverware as well but once we were able to get him he seemed eager to please and cheery about his work. I mentioned that the chips were good and indeed they were! I of course had to order the pink tacos. The tacos were chicken tacos that had a purposeful pink hue to them. They were tasty but not by any means really authentic. Not bad eats though. Out of the casino restaurants that we hit on this trip I would have to say that Pink Taco was the best one I went to on this trip!",

We chose to go for lunch and it was pretty quiet when we went in (on a Friday afternoon). They had a ton of staff on and everyone seemed really friendly and like they enjoyed their jobs. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a frozen mango margarita. It was the best mango margarita I have ever had. They gave us tortilla chips and a plate of three dips (two salsas and a guacamole). The guacamole was smooth and creamy and the salsas had SO much flavor. They were delish!!  My husband ordered the chicken and cheese enchilada with green and red sauce and I ordered the chicken burrito. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and it was a nice break from the chain Mexican restaurants we often frequent back home. We also ordered the churros for dessert and those didn't disappoint as well!  The atmosphere was great and we loved the decor of the restaurant. We definitely recommend checking out Pink Taco if you take a trip to Vegas! :)",

Although I have seen kids in there, I probably wouldn't take my kids only because the music is so loud and the environment is made more for the adults.",

    "text": "It gives me great regret to have to write this review but after being a loyal patron for over a decade, the last experience for the food was not that great so I'm hoping this review lands in the right hands for a major makeover in the kitchen and get it back to what it once was.  We can only judge by the last performance. Guilty that I didn't rave about this place with positive reviews over the past decade but it is what it is. Our last experience (after several experiences of it going consistently downhill) just screams to review negatively on the quality of the food to hopefully save this place. Pink Taco has been my place to go at least a couple of times a month for the past several years.  The front line Staff is outstanding. 5 stars for the staff. No complaints there when it comes to this. \"Shank\" the bartender is outstanding if you eat at the bar. Definitely 5 stars for this guy. Last two trips on orders being wrong or the food being burnt, he took care of it and made it right.   So... let's get into the food for the last visit which was not that great. Happy Hour $6 menu which is appealing to order multiple things when it's more then one person to do the whole sharing thing.  -- Chicken Tacquitos --- Burnt to a crisp. Shank took these back and got a decent order back. Still tasted worse then what I could buy in the grocery store for $2.00 and throw in the microwave. Fact of the matter is though, they let the first order come out burnt to a crisp which should tell you everything about the kitchen staff.   -- Grilled Chicken Skewers -- I'm thinking there is going to be some veggies on these skewers like real skewers but nope. Dry, no seasoning and pathetic. For the Happy Hour price, Del Taco is FAR MORE TASTY for a third of the price.  -- Tortas -- This was like mystery meat. We have no idea what that meat was but it was pretty disgusting. Pretty sure the stomach aches that followed this recent trip were because of whatever meat that it was. I've been all over the world and have had street meat in foreign countries (could have been pigeon, dog, cat or rat meat) that was far tastier. I would highly advise to stay away from these.  -- Cerviches --The fish was certainly tasting fishy. Maybe that's what made our stomachs upset after this meal because the fish certainly was not fresh.  Big Plus -- Mi Casa Margarita was pretty tasty. Not as good as the top shelf margarita (which is awesome there) but not bad for $6.    All in all... Happy Hour Menu for $6 isn't a good deal. Del Taco is far better for far less so I have to advise to stay far away from it. Main menu has much better things and I really have to RAVE about Pink Taco having the BEST Chile Relleno's in town.   I feel bad for the great staff there because the kitchen has gone downhill when it comes to the quality of the food there. Bartenders are awesome there -- absolutely fantastic. However, the kitchen needs a TON of help. I mean really, who in the heck who has any pride in their food would send out food burnt to a crisp???   So hopefully... this review catches the attention of the right people and they clean out that kitchen problem so I come back and give this very cool place a great review. The front line staff is fantastic but the kitchen needs some serious help.",

Drinks were brought out right away.  Chips and salsa followed.  The Salsa was very good.  I ended up pouring that on my tacos.  I opted for the Taco al Carbon (steak).  The plate came out with 3 small tacos, beans, and rice.  The flavor was pretty straight forward.  Nothing spectacular at all.  I have had better taco from the \"taco lady\" that we have had come to our parties to cater.  The other people in our group opted for the steak enchilada and fish tacos.  No one really raved about the food at all.  So not sure what the hype is all about.  Would probably not bother to try it again.",

Drinks are descent and happy hour is a good time to check it all out. It's one of the only spots at the Hard Rock that has any draw for me. I'd put it just above MR. Luckys 24/7 but far below Culinary Dropout or Nobu. (and I'd rather go CDO than Nobu anytime :)   Given the limited choices at HRH it's usually between Pink Taco or Culinary Dropout. I only go to Mr. Luckys for their Fire Roasted Nachos.. Things have changed over there...   Anyway, drop into Pink Taco if you need a \"Mexican\" style food fix :) Happy Eating!",

The tacos are a lot smaller than the usual... but at 1 buck each... buy a whole butt load of them!  All meals come with free chips and 3 different salsa/sauces.. chipotle is definitely the best... save some of that for your taco's too.

I liked the tamal de elote appetizer the best but I've still had better. I had part of a cheese quesadilla which was bland and tasteless and then skipped the other appetizers because they just didn't look so hot.  I had a steak burrito for the main course and again, just not good. It's very rare that I stop eating altogether but I gave up after a few bites. I tried to salvage the beef but even that wasn't that great.  I give it two stars since the service was pretty good and patient considering the size of our group but I'd advise skipping this place.",

I went there for lunch today, I split a Chicken Tostada Salad with my co-worker and we both tried the Chicken Tortilla soup. The salad was just OK, but I will give the soup some props! It was perfectly made, with the right amount of ingredients to broth. Sometimes they put so much crap in soups trying to make it better and I think it ruins it, I didn't order chili I ordered soup! Their chips are also amazing, they make them there!  Other than wishing I could have had a Margarita on my lunch break today, I would go back for lunch or dinner, but more for the experience of being at the Hard Rock Hotel and enjoying good company, not so much for the food.",

Nice flavors as far as the items we tried.",

They have a brunch with like 5 to 10 items on it & I thought 'is that all I get'?  During this visit, we sat up at the bar, there was like 6 people in the restaurant, and the bartender looked as if we were boring her to death. And the service was pretty lousy in general.  We went today. Ordered a fajita. it was just OK as well. Chicken was over seasoned and by the time it came out to me there was no more sizzle to the fajita. It was hot, but it definitely was not sizzling or smoking with wholesome goodness as one would expect. I didn't finish most of it.  Co-worker got the fried shrimp tacos, he picked the shrimp out of the 2nd one, didn't finish most of it.   Other co-worker got a salad, she picked the salad part off the top of the tostada, didn't finish most of it.   Chips need more salt and the salsa is lackluster.  If you're staying at the hotel and it's there, go ahead and try it, but I wouldn't drive to this hotel to eat here.  Also, thought was a little expensive.  My ice tea was $3 and by the end of the meal lunch had cost me $29...meh",

I'm going to at least try to get some free guac next time I'm down there...  The good: Portions are good sized, even for a fatty-fat-fat accountant who is eating to escape reality.  The pink tacos, fish tacos, burritos, and etc have great portion sizes.  The carne asada and canitas plates are both awesome, but a tad bit expensive.  The steak tonight was amazing.  No sh*t.  Service is pretty spot on.    The critiques: You might want to avoid this place if you're going out on a first date on a Friday night.  It can get pretty loud.  The scenery is decent.  Nothing visually appealing enough to write home about.  I'll be back.  Hell, I'll probably be back later this week since it's uber convenient.",

Price wise, was about average for most casino restaurants, but not outrageous by any means. I ordered the enchiladas and thought they were very good, possibly some of the best that I've had from a restaurant.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving some good mexican food. My only complaint is that I was not particularly impressed with their breakfast menu (hence only 4 stars).",

We were sitting at the bar and the staff was very friendly, chatty and attentive.

You have to pay extra for salsa with heat as well. Also we sat on the patio which was not a good idea. The table had bird poo and ants on it so we had to move.

We had their Cadillac Margarita and Jalapeno Margarita which were both great. Not too tart and not over powered with sour mix. For dinner we had the Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and a selection of 6 different Street Tacos. All of which were very good but the Pork Tacos...Awesome! Great scenery, good food and great staff made our dining experience fun and looking forward to visiting again in the future.",

The shrimp taco was the only one I enjoyed out of the sampler I ordered, and the signature taco was kind of embarrassing. Drinks were tasty, but I'd save that taco money for the slots.",

    "text": "I was not impressed with place at all. Came here on Cinco de Mayo After a concert at the Joint. It was around 11pm and we were a group of 6. It was not busy at all and we were seated almost immediately which was nice. The waitress came by quickly to take our orders. She was visibly disappointed that we did not want to order alcoholic beverages and kept trying to convince us to get Margarita's. We politely declined. As we had already had 4 rounds inside the Joint and a few prior to that and were trying to sober up to drive home. She finally gave up on drinks and took our orders. I ordered the Posole. 1 friend ordered a burrito and the rest ordered a variety of tacos. When the food came, the I got my soup and the others had plates of tacos placed in front of them. My friend picked up his plate handing it back and said he'd ordered the burrito, she took it, put it back down in front of him and said nope, you got tacos. To which his wife replied \"No, Miss, he did order a burrito I heard him\" and again she said no. She said \"I heard tacos so here's your tacos\" and walked away.  My husband wanted to call the manager but friend said no, he'd just eat the tacos and he didn't want to make a fuss. As for the food, he did enjoy those tacos, his wife loved her fish tacos, my husband did not like his tacos at all. He had the chicken, shrimp & Al pastor. He said all lacked flavor. Our other 2 friends said their tacos were just alright. My Posole. Man I was looking forward to Posole. This Posole was not good. It was super salty. I only ate half of my small bowl, took the rest home. Next day woke up with my tongue swollen (which is what always happens to me when I consume too much salt) I thought I'd heat up the left overs and let my son try it and he said same, way too salty. I don't think I'd go back here.",

There is not meal that I haven't tried and didn't like .. really wish that I could give this place 5 stars but My only complaint is that some of the bartenders aren't talkative, have ZERO sense of hospitality. When we 1st started coming here in 2012 they used to be super friendly and always made you feel welcomed to be there (not weird & awkward) ... I don't know if there has a been a decline in the quality of people or what but whom ever is in charge of hiring bartenders should really seek people with positive up beat energy.  When people go on vacation to get away from the bullshit of their real lives at home they don't want to deal with or be served by someone whom acts as if you are a burden to them, or better yet as if they loathe their job.",

The margaritas were pretty strong and sugary at the same time, but I think that's what they are going for.  Service was good, fast and accommodating.  Cons were I could smell the cig smoke bellowing in from the open doors to the patio and pool area. It's the Hard Rock though, it's no preschool.  There are other Mexican restaurants I prefer over Pink Taco, even if it's name is so demure.",

I tried the lobster taco, grilled lobster tail with fruit salsa, rice and beans, the lobster was so tender and yummy, tasted even better with hot sauce! Hubby tried steak tacos, flavorful steak pieces, very delicious. The churros were as good as always. Both of us enjoyed our lunch food so much, Pink taco never disappoints!

Atmosphere: Great theme throughout the restaurant.  Not a quiet place, but what do you expect from the Hard Rock.  It's more of a party spot where you can mingle at the bar or just enjoy good food.  There also always swarms of eye candy here as well...so enjoy.  Service: I've never had bad service here.  Everyone is always on point.  Food: My most favorite item is the sweet corn enchiladas.

    "text": "Pink Taco is famous? I assumed so since many of my group members really wanted to come here. I expected something a little more spectacular or unique with their quality of food. The chips and dips were GREAT. They offer 3 different dips (guac, cilantro chili and a red one ....yeah not very descriptive but best I can do!) and the chips were fresh. I just got full of of that. The sangria was okay as well. It tastes better the longer you leave it out and have the ice mix in. Maybe a little too strong for my taste. We ordered the PINK TACO dish. It's their signature dish right?!? Well, everything was a little too salty. The chicken was marinated well, but I was so thirsty after. They gave a generous amount of chicken with some tomatoes and lettuce on a freshly-made flour tortilla. A corn tortilla may have been better. The rice and beans on the side were salty as well but still tasty. The fish tacos were good as well, but the fish was a little small. I guess it fits the small tortilla.  In the end, it's really filling and you will need to.....release some of it after! It was a pleasant meal but does not live up to its reputation.  Pink Taco, youz a salty taco!",

That being said, the first couple of bites were phenomenal - and really only because we went here after one of the EDC nights. Basically, we got back to our rooms at the Hard Rock around 7am...I showered/cleaned up, because there's just no way I can bring myself to sleep without taking a shower after EDC, then we all woke up around 10, cleaned up, checked out, then headed to Pink Tacos around 12:30. The last meal I'd had was breakfast...the previous day (don't judge! who has time to eat or sleep in Vegas anyways??!!?!).",

Cal Mex style food w/ good margaritas and a Vegas style staff. Quick in and out, decent prices and delicious margaritas. We have been to the Los Angeles location before but we enjoyed the food and environment here a little more. Perfect if you want to escape the pool sun for a little while.",

They could have served dog food and we probably would have liked it given Natalie's personality and the great service she provided.   I actually had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate from here. It was a $25 certificate that I paid a whole $2 for. With five us including sodas (no alcohol) our bill came to a whole $50 including tax and tip (after the $25 discount). Not bad at all given the location.   Now for the food.. I loved that they served fresh chips with three salsas including one green salsa that was heavy with cilantro. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken tostadas and they were very good. The dressing they were served with was sort of sweet and just made the dish. The only thing that bothered me was that the avocados on my salad were a little brown. Coming from CA, I think I'm just spoiled with beautiful avocados so most probably wouldn't have noticed this. My daughter ordered the same thing and she liked it as well. My oldest ordered a steak burrito that I think she felt was average. She did like that they had black beans. My parents ordered enchiladas and they were pleased.   If not for Natalie, I might have been tempted to give a three star review, but she was just great and I wish her all the best with her baby.",

We were given a bill just after we finished our food which was 1 entree/1 drink each.  I noticed the bottom of the receipt was torn off but figured maybe they had just changed out the tape.  We decided to order a second round of drinks and received a second bill also with the bottom torn off.  At this point I was suspicious.  We both added up our tabs (1 entree, 2 drinks) and figured them to be about $30.  We gave our debit cards and both got CC receipts only (the itemized receipt mysteriously disappeared) for about $45 each.  I asked if the tip was already included and she got really nervous.  We sent her away and asked the waitress from the next table to get a manager.  We had the manager sit down and asked her to estimate our bill based on the menu prices.  We explained the torn/missing receipts and she immediately took care of everything.  We had to wait quite a few minutes for the issue to be resolved and noticed that our waitress had been missing for at least 15 minutes and other people were helping her tables.  I assume she was fired on the spot - and even though the manger did everything right, the food just wasn't good enough to return here especially with so many other better Mexican food options in town.",

So we drove out in the 115-degree weather, and landed at the Hard Rock Hotel's Pink Taco.    Upon entering the restaurant, you're not only greeted with the retro-looking swinging bulbs (made of empty half-beer bottles), but smothered by a whif of fresh corn tortillas on a hot-grill.  Thank goodness there was a piece of glass between myself and the lady making the fresh corn tortillas, because I would have been the first to reach over and grab a freshly made tortilla from the grill.    Once seated, the server brings this trio of salsas.  I was not properly introduced to this trio by names, so I created my own: Smokey, Green one, and Spicy.  All three had their unique flavors that targeted all different levels of heat on my flavor-chart.  My only complaint: they should have buckets instead of ramekins.  Perhaps a straw too?   It was like speed-dating, when the next item decided to steal my attention - why hello, carne asada tacos.  The chopped onions and bits of cilantro nestled so cozily in between the chunks of steak, all basking with such glory on the fresh corn tortillas.  I almost didn't see the rice blending-in with the orange fiesta-style plate, perhaps because the creamy black beans were crowding their space.  Everything had so much flavor and presence, one fork was not utensil-enough to assist in this meal.  But really, please bring a bucket of the salsa trio, as I would like each of the three tacos to be accompanied by even more flavor-goodness.   Four stars for the flavor, price, and speed of service.  When you're in Vegas, you want good food (that booze from last night isn't sitting so well right now is it?), at a good price (because the rest of the money was left at the tables), and fast service (so you can get back to the tables and claim what's yours to begin with!)",

    "text": "Ya ready for the review? O right so here it goooooesss:  Pink taco at the Hard rock hotel casino.  This place is okay.  As in A-OK.  it aint nothing special.  I mean overall i give it an average review.  I kinda put this type of establishment in the bucket of restaurants located in hotels.  Usually they are average tasting food to me.  But what do you really expect from a restaurant that serves mexican food in a hotel/casino.  Not much.  The food I ordered.  Shrimp tacos, Ceviche, and Guac.  They were good.  Not the best.  Definitely had better mexican before.    I've scanned some of the more highly rated reviews by other yelpers for pink tacos and have to wonder if they've ever had really good mexican food before.  Some of the reviewers are blown away by the awesome guacamole and tacos.   Great for them if they've experienced some of the best mexican here but I don't think they know.   They just don't know.  its' all good.  You should give it a shot if you've never been though.  You' can't beat it down unless you give it a taste here.   We were seated outside facing rehab so that was the only highlight of our meal here.  Foodwise, a-okay.  Bla bla blah no more review here, just typing nonsense for the final sentence if you are reading still you can stop now. bye.",

Thank goodness I had a full beer in hand to pass the food down.  Anyway, I'll still go to Pink Taco's if I ever step a foot inside HRH again.",

Ahi tacos were a nice surprise with 4 on the plate. Just a little bummed that prices are inevitably climbing.",

They had this awesome yogurt and fruit parfait with fresh coconut  and this fantastic granola.  I wanted to try the breakfast burrito, but we did not have time to do the breakfast again.  The issue I had was the service. They were very understaffed and could not keep up.  I felt bad for the staff because they were so busy, but it was just very slow.  The bar tender was not very nice and acted like she could not help us.  The food was good, but service was definitely lacking!  I will be back because I like it and I love the HRH!!",

Although I'll have to say when we did have her she was very polite. We ordered the quest fundido which was fantastic! I ordered the al pastor street tacos which were really good but if you ask me extremely over priced. These were 3 mini tacos with no rice or beans for 12 bucks. My husband ordered two tamales the chicken with tomatillo and the queso tamale. Here where it gets weird..... The chicken tamale had a piece of black plastic in side of it!!!! I almost was embarrassed to mention it to our waitress and felt like she thought I planted it in the food lol. She was apologetic and offered to get us another tamale which we decided to do without. So she comped us the tamale which was good.  I love this place, the atmosphere and the decor is great! I feel like they are a bit over priced and feel like they can do better with their prices. They have always had great food until this incident with the plastic mystery piece in our tamale. Not sure if we will eat here again but I'm hoping it was just a bad day for them. This place would have easily gotten 4 stars had there not been a foreign object in our food.",

Boyfriend and I both got margaritas. They were good, pretty strong. To eat, he got the ahi tuna tostadas and I got the sopes. I know happy hour plates are supposed to be small, but geez.  His tostadas were literally 3 chips with a couple pieces of tuna on top. Super small!  My sopes were GOOD. Like soo good. But again, so so tiny. I could probably fit two in the palm of my hand, and the plate only comes with 3 -.-  Anyways, the food was good. Just wish there was a littttle more. Luckily they give you chips and salsa, which were bangin. Probably the best chips and salsa I've ever had. I'm always weary to try salsas because I'm a huge baby with anything spicy but this was delicious and smoky and perfect.  Very well done, Pink Taco.",

During my stay at the HRH I dined and maybe stumbled into Pink Taco a few times, entrance conveniently located via casino or pool deck.  The ambiance is kickback, the decor is funky, food and drinks decent and the service rocks!  Food is over-priced, but can't complain when food is comped.  After a few \"Pink Panties\" the Sabana de Pollo with Chimichurri couldn't have tasted better.  The Paper thin seared chicken breast came with beans, cheese, grilled onions and serrano chile, accompanied with rice and pico de gallo salsa hit the spot!   The trademark \"Pink Taco\" -or- Panuchos is a must try, made with homemade corn tortillas stuffed with black beans, topped with grilled chicken, salsa roja, pickled onions and avocado.  A table favorite was dessert, the warm Chocolate Brownie - served with vanilla bean ice cream, cajeta and hot fudge.  Warning: Pink Taco can get loud, suiting for those sitting at the watering hole!",

However, the Pink Taco was FANTASTIC. We were seated immediately and our server came to greet us in under a minute. It was kind of busy for an afternoon so our pitchers of margaritas were brough over by the manager, Christian, who was super friendly and chatted with us. We immediately started to consider how this restaurant was run compared to what we were used to, but everyone working seemed extremely conscientious. In between taking the time to chat with us -- Christian did his rounds and seemed to happily greet every table. Our food came out promptly and the shrimp tacos and salad were to die for. The margartia pitchers never seemed to go empty and we overall had such a great time that we went back again a couple days later. Everything lived up to our expectations for a second time around and Christian and the hostess even remembered us. Overall, probably the best experience we had at a restaurant in vegas -- we were certainly suprised that no other places lived up to our high standards!",

It's pretty standard Americanized Mexican, but I think they dropped the ball in a few key areas.  First off was the chips and salsa.  The chips were A+, some of the best restaurant chips I've ever had.  But the salsa...D-.  They gave us 3 different kinds: tomato-based, dark green, light green.  Each one tasted pretty much the same and had ZERO spice to them.  I ordered the chicken tacos which came with rice and beans and also tried the chicken skewers.  The tacos were basically chicken and pico de gallo on a tortilla.  All ingredients were good, but how about a little cheese and seasoning to the chicken!  The chicken skewers had a little spice to them (finally!).  The service was quick and everything came out correctly, but the waitress was clearly not in a mood to be friendly with a group of 16 guys who tip well.  Her loss I suppose.",

The potatoes came out cold and were under cooked (they had that crispy rawness to them). The cold potatoes were accompanied by cold, non-buttered wheat toast. And, I got cold cold butter when I asked for butter for my toast. No excuse - It's breakfast people and the restaurant wasn't even busy.   We visited Pink Taco a second time to have drinks with friends who were eating. They had the burritos and were also underwhelmed with the food.

Nope.  In desperate search of something to fill our bellies before exploring the F&F Ball on Halloween eve, the We Don't Hate Fun club sauntered into a half-empty Pink Taco. Snow White, a pirate, the Green Hornet and Cato all got escorted straight to a table, where they were later joined by a boxer, a bumblebee, and Dexter.  The first four of us needed something in our bellies before the debauchery of the evening began, so we started off with chips and some VERY watery types of salsa.  Three of us ordered shrimp tacos and one ordered fish tacos.  A round of margaritas and beers completed our check.  The later addition to our party just got some cocktails and a bucket of beers.  Small serving of mystery rice, some decent-tasting but generic beans, and two meh-looking eh-sized soft tacos.  Shrimp was cooked in a batter that felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time, the accompanying \"sauce\" in it only served the purpose of cooling it down unnecessarily (along with too much cabbage), and there wasn't enough shrimp or fish tucked away inside to justify paying as much as we did per plate.  The True highlight of the meal was the delicious tortilla, but even toward the end of our meal that started getting a bit chewy.  To add insult to injury, our waitress was more of the \"two-minute differential\" if you know what I mean.  She was lovely, and nice, but it took her about 120 seconds to process anything that she was told.  It definitely made for a great beginning to the rest of the tripped out evening.  Drinks were meh, service was meh (although our waters were always filled, thanks guys!), ambience was meh, food was meh, generally speaking it was all meh.  I've for sure experienced better.",

I had been to the Pink Taco  in Scottsdale, AZ, prior to it's closing, a few times, so I knew the menu a bit, and love the pink tacos. We ordered those , the queso and a sampler appetizer plate. The appetizer plate was full of appetizer...a quesadilla, carne asada skewers, chicken tikki skewers, taquitos (which are so different here I LOVE!!).. the queso bean dip was too much and lacking in spice for us.. We kept adding hot sauce to it.. as well as the salsa that comes with the chips. BUT this is a great happy hour with 2 for 1 beers.. we even came back again during our stay.

    "text": "It gets two stars because our waitress was awesome. The bartender was unfriendly and made our drinks wrong. The hostess was also quite unfriendly.   April 28th we had just checked in to the hotel and met at the Pink Taco for a quick bite and cocktails. We saw a sign that said $.99 margaritas and inquired with the bartender. He mentioned we had to get a players card to get the deal. Well we only had 15 more minutes on the Happy Hour clock to even benefit from it and we were ready to just get started. The last thing we wanted to do at that moment was wait in line for a players card. Not going to lie, the sign is what got us in to the restaurant. Seemed convenient and then turned out to be inconvenient. If it's too good to be True...   I decided to ask what the price range was for margaritas on a normal menu and as he walked away in irritation he said $9 - $100 and then didn't ask if I wanted anything or offer me a menu.   We were hungry and we were there so we decided to stay and get a table. The hostess didn't do anything memorable to be lame, she just was disinterested an unfriendly.   The Pink Taco was a terrible first stop after checking in. It's like they both hated their job and were taking it out on us.   The waitress was awesome. Thank goodness. She was friendly, positive and accommodating. We had a couple special order tacos. There's always one in the group that has to be different :)   No matter how friendly our waitress was it still didn't make up for the fact that the bartender made our drinks wrong. We order straight from the menu. It was something like a Spicy Michelada. Well they added tomato juice and that was not on the menu!!! So gross. She returned with drinks made the right way but we couldn't get past the initial tomato juiced beer we were originally handed. We never asked her to do it, she just took it off the bill on her own.   It was just a crappy way to start the trip. The rest of the Hard Rock experience was great. The Paradise Tower is awesome. This review is simply a reflection on our experience at The Pink Taco.",

What I did not expect when I walked into this Hard Rock hotel establishment was the abundance of tequila they had...and the prices per shot were not too bad (considering it's Vegas).   I had a glass of the Milagro Reserve Anejo and El Tesoro Anniversary Tequila. Both were great...as the staff takes pride in their liquid refreshment. If you are in the mood for good tequila, served without salt and lime, then make sure to head to Pink Taco at the Hard Rock!!!",

It was delicious though and the free chips and salsa definitely helped their case. They were good and our server was very attentive to keep refilling them. My boyfriend for the loaded nachos with the hottest fire sauce on the side, it was really good! Overall, the name draws you in and the food and service are good but they should rethink their prices. The portion for the nachos was good but I think the tacos should've been cheaper.",

The food is good & fresh and the portions are large, but nothing you would not find in many other mexican restaurants.

If you are looking for a casual diner  of tacos, nachos, & burritos   before hitting the the Hard Rock then this is a good choice",

She finally came by and took our order and left we waited another 15min and no chips or salsa. Meanwhile tables were getting seated next to us and recieveing chips and salsa as well as water.  Asked the server if we were going to get chips and salsa and she said \"i think so\".  We tried to give her some slack bc she had quite a few tables and that is just poor management skills.  She responded in attitude with \"Its nothing new\". We recieved our FOOD before our drinks and the chips and salsa when we were finished with our food? Finally we had to get our check and she told us if we wanted it taken care ofwe should do it at the hostess station which is where we asked for the manager.   He was some young little condisending boy who had no idea what he was doing and just comped our drinks? Really when the service is that bad thats all you're going to do? He didn't care because they were busy... but I will Never coming back here again.",

Cool points for being inside the Hard Rock Hotel and maintaining the rocker vibe while still having a mexican restaurant feel.  I love the open air patio that overlooks the pool, and how the doors are open so there is a breeze inside the restaurant. More cool points for making fresh tortillas for everyone to see.  The chips and salsa comes with 3 types of salsa ... and they are all pretty good.  My chicken fajitas were very good at $15, but the portion was kinda small.  But hey, lets face it...  don't we all want to try out a place called \"pink taco\" ?  Good job with the name, marketing people.  Their pink taco clothing is pretty popular too - I noticed a lot of people coming in to purchase their apparel.  *final cool points for seeing Carey Hart and Joel Madden while we were there*  If I say \"cool\" one more time in this review I am going to make myself sick.

    "text": "Quick Look: First time returning to the Pink Taco in 5 years and much like the rest of the property, the Pink Taco might \"hold up\" but it is starting to look, feel and taste \"tired.\"   In Depth Review: As locals we used to go to the Pink Taco for a good meal, tasty drinks & high energy atmosphere that made it a great spot for people watching. Wife and I went to the HRH this past Friday, May 9th (2014) and walked into a casino that was as dead as I have ever seen in the city for a wknd night. Music was quiet, the circle bar empty, what happened to the energy and atmosphere of the Hard Rock? Made our way past the death metal fans there for an OTEP concert and got to the Pink Taco check-in at 9pm. Had to wait a few minutes to be acknowledged and brought to our upper level inside table. The restaurant was empty and maybe a dozen tables sat, I counted 4 people at the bar. Strange vibe. Not the typical atmosphere we remembered in this restaurant in the past.   Chips and spicy salsa sauce was delivered to the table right away. The salsa dip was delicious. No water was delivered and the spicy salsa was a bit too much as we had to sit for 10 minutes before our waiter made it to our table to introduce himself. He did stop at the table next to us first that was sat 5-6 minutes after us. We ordered drinks and the Taquitos appetizer. They were a little too chewy and hard to cut in half. My wife enjoyed them though. For our entrees we ordered the chicken Enchilada and the Carnitas Platter. Timing was OK between the appetizer and the main entrees as we waited to order the entrees until after the appetizer was served.   The chicken enchiladas were tasty, a little messy and fell apart, but certainly tasted good! The Carnitas sampler was all over the place, the beans, rice, tortilla and grilled tomatoes were just fine. The carnitas meat was a bit hard and dried out. Some pieces were chewy and tasted like they had been cooked earlier and sat under a heat light. Not sure what that was all about?   Wife loved her Margarita. So that is important to note. The poor girl at the bar looked beyond bored. The entire experience was all overt the board. May have just been an \"off\" night and weekend. Staff looked bored and we saw a few of them eating dinner in the back of the restaurant behind us.   Was a bit shocked at how quiet the entire property was. Hope this is a rare exception and not the new rule over there. Mothers Day Wknd may have played into the property being slower than usual, who knows? Will we go back? Sure, but we are not going to go out of our way to go there as there is too much competition in the Mexican food department in Vegas - and I feel the Pink Taco may have lost it's edge?!  To sum it up - it was an OK visit at best.",

I ordered the carnitas which were $14, but they were seasoned very well. The rice and beans were typical and wouldn't say their stellar, but then again they're staples of any tex-mex style joint.   I asked for more tortillas for my meal as I was only given 2. I found out later that they charge for extra tortillas. When I'm already paying $14 I should be given extra tortillas or if you're going to charge me then at least give me more than 2.  The server was nice until near the end. She was upset that we asked for separate checks. We had a group of 8 of us and of course we wanted separate checks. They even had an auto-gratuity on there and she couldn't do that for us? She was really annoyed but did it anyways.  Overall, the food was pretty good but overpriced and the service at the end sucked and we had to hunt her down to even get refills on water when it was hot as hell in there.",

We were all pretty hungry and sat down to delicious and complimentary chips and salsa that we munched down within minutes. To our surprise, they refilled them for us 3 more times!  Most of us ordered the 3 taco dinner.  I had the fish, shrimp and pork.  The pork was my least favorite (relish was too sweet); however, all the ingredients were fresh and I was full on just 3 tacos - no rice or beans.  One person in our group ordered a pink taco and wasn't impressed.  A little pricey (but typical for Vegas) and slower to get our meals but otherwise no complaints.  I'd go back!",

I added a side of guac ($1) and lots of salsa and hot sauce. The dish came with a side of something (maybe jicama?) that was crispy and fresh and had a sweet heat to it. No homefries, but I stole some from my friends so can attest that they were crispy and flavourful!  We drank coffee because it was morning(ish) and the costs of the cocktails here were a little extreme. They were big comforting mugs of coffee that kept coming, so that was nice. We sat on the patio by the pool and watched three different kinds of birds go insane stealing all the leftover tortilla chips (complimentary) from tables as soon as people got up. They swooped so low they almost hit us each in the face at least once. It was quite entertaining. The pigeons in Vegas make the ones back home in Toronto look like doves. And I have never seen our sparrows behave in such a scavengeresque manner. Vegas really does bring out the worst in everybody doesn't it? haha.   Anyway, I love the dirty, dry humour of this place. Staying in Hard Rock, I was greeted to the inappropriate but welcome messaging each day. A fave said, \"Where pink tacos are not just a phase in college!\" Do it up. Get your pink tacos. You're in Vegas after all!",

I've had Pink Taco in LA and felt like it was so much better. In vegas, the lines go out the door but there were so many empty tables so either they need to have more kitchen and table staff or they just need to get people seated more quickly! We just walked right in for the open bar seating instead which was plentiful and way quicker.   Ordered the enchiladas with the poblano sauce which was pretty good! Had some guacamole on the side but it was just okay.   Overall the place would be nicer if service was better since the food was pretty okay.",

    "text": "The name is Pink Taco and you can actually order Pink Tacos?!?  I loved so much about this place. The ambiance was so cute and so well themed especially for Vegas. Things can get a bit overwhelming or over the top when it comes to Vegas, but they nailed it. I would say a \"Day of the Dead\" type of theme. Awesome.  Now the food tho..  THE CHIPS AND SALSA! I am picky with my salsa and they nailed it. Best I've had in a long time, and they were not stingy with the portions. I would say the Tacos were a slight disappointment after those chips and salsa. I ordered the Taco Trio which included the house Pink Taco, the pork Taco with pineapple, and the Chicken Taco. Mainly, I thought they were a little plain and I could only tell the difference between the one pork and not the other 2 Tacos.  The trio did not come with any sides, and ended up with a $18 bill with a Dr Pepper and my meal. Kinda pricey but that's Vegas for you!",

I had the famous pink taco and my husband had the carne asada entree.  both were on point! To drink I had Sancho's mojito. The food is great but the service was horrible.  for one, we never got our appetizer and it took about half hour for our food. The server was short and inattentive and only checked on us once. Plus it wasn't even that busy to begin with. Sunday early evening and tables were empty around us. Maybe it was just our luck... sigh. What a bad first impression.",

I would expect to have more food for what I paid. On too of that the meat was ridiculously salty (the chef must smoke) My husband ordered regular tacos and was sick the rest of the night. The corn tortillas were dripping in grease and even he thought it was over salted. The margarita I ordered was watered down and overly sweet. I did order some guacamole with veggies and that was okay, but that's pretty hard to screw up. The environment is really fun and I like the decor, but ultimately I'm not impressed. Left a bad first impression on the restaurants in the Hard Rock",

It does give you something to look around at. At HRH, the whole place isn't busy, even on a holiday Saturday night, we had no wait to be seated. Waitress was nice enough, she checked on us several times, didn't speak Spanish though. We tried the Pink tacos. My wife, who's from northern Mexico, says that these type are from the south. I'm not sure how to describe them other than, they're not your typical street tacos that we know here in the states. I was thinking they were some fusion thing. The food plates seemed more upscale than how I described the barrio decor feeling. The chefs took more care in the presentation. After being at Tacos El Gordo earlier, this was a totally different feel. Chips and salsa were good. The cost- a typical sit down restaurant meal $55 for two with tip. Just have the tacos and water- $35.",

I also ordered a side of flour tortillas, yum!  Right when you walk into the restaurant there is an area that is used to make homemade tortillas. This is always fun to watch. Overall the environment is comfortable and colorful. There is a lot to look at. You can also sit out on the patio with a view of the pool. We enjoy sitting outside when it's a bit cooler.

It was so unique and the cheese was oozing out and a little bit of a kick from the jalapeno. The chicken tacos were a little more ordinary. The wings were also very good - juicy and flavorful. They were fast in their service and so nice. They also had unlimited chips and salsa and they were delicious. In total, our bill was about $21 for 3 people which is pretty crazy!",

My friend is vegan so we ordered the mushroom tacos with a side of rice and beans. The tacos were beautiful but the smokey flavor of the mushrooms were overwhelming and did not make me want to go back for another bite. My friend and I each ordered our own plate (which came with 3 tacos) and we both only are one of our tacos. The rice and the beans on the other hand were amazing and we both finished them! I also ordered one of my new favorite drinks! It's called \"The Panty Dropper\". Very fruity and yummy! Lots of sugar but so worth it! I wish I would have taken a picture.. they serve it with a martini glass full of cotton candy and you pour your drink into the glass! So fun :) If I was rating just based off the drink it would be four stars, but I think this place needs to either add more vegan options, or revamp the one they have!",

Oh, my margarita was good, not enough fresh limey flavor tho, seemed like mainly ice & tequila & it was $12 **update~~~we've been here 2 times since this review, not enough servers both times. We sat at our table both times for 5-10 mins before someone asked us what we wanted to drink or brought us chips. Also the food was not hot when it arrived & it was just ok.

Chips were very crunchy and tasted recently made. Salsa was good and had a nice kick to it. We ordered two drinks to start. I had the michelada and my wife had a Margareta.   Pink taco combo - it comes with the pink taco special that's a tortilla stuffed with black beans, grilled chicken, pickled onions, avocado and salsa de arbol. Accompanied by a cheese enchilada and pork Ribs. The taco was just ok. When you try to eat it, it falls apart and I'm. It a fan of things falling apart. The enchilada was good and cheese and the ribs were nice and tasty.    My wife had the street tacos. 3 tacos on home made corn tortillas. She had the crispy shrimp taco with red cabbage slaw chipotle cream and avocado.  The Baja that came with fish, cabbage slaw, chipotle crema and Pico de gallo. The last taco she had was the al pastor that's rotisserie pork and roasted pineapple salsa. Oh can't forget the side of beans. She really enjoyed the street tacos and her favorite was the crispy shrimp taco.   If staying in the hard rock or around the area give this place a shot. You will like the decor, ambiance and the food.",

Good happy hour (M-F 3-7pm) at the bar with $6 specials including margaritas, sangria, and 2 for 1 beers. Food specials too with items like grilled skewers and flautas. I had the ceviche and it was bright and citrusy with just a little heat. The fish was fresh and flavorful. In addition, the house made chips are served hot and they are so addictive. It's honestly very hard to stop dipping those warm chips into salsa. So good.   Friendly bartenders and overall cool vibe makes this a great spot to pregame before heading out. They also have lunch specials under $10 too.",

I couldn't finish it. Instead I just asked for more chips and salsa.   I hate that there isn't much else I can say about this place. I would love to come back another time to explore the menu. I've read other reviews where people love their food! If I happen to make another trip out to Vegas, I will give this place another shot!

To start,  I used Open Table to make the reservation and received an email from Open Table that I was a no show meaning the hostess didn't know how to log my visit.  The food was ok, but the traditional Pink Taco dish is now presented as a shared dish instead of an individual meal.  The service was ok and felt that I was always one step ahead of the service.  I'm a local so with all the restaurants in town I'll probably pass on re-visiting Pink Taco in the near future.  Kind of sad as it was one of my favorites.",

    "text": "Okay yes....who doesn't really think of YOU KNOW WHAT when they hear Pink Taco??  Anywho, my friends and I stopped in for dinner as we were staying at Hard Rock.  Our waiter was great and very courteous to do 3 separate checks for our party of 5.    I was tempted to get their signature item, the little Pink Tacos, but opted for the carnitas plate instead ($14).  The chips they served were pretty good, the salsa was standard and more on the watery side.  Our food didn't take too long to come out and boy were there lots of chunks of pork on my plate.  I couldn't finish all the food, it was also served with spanish rice on the side and tomatoes and guacamole.  The pork though flavorful enough was a little on the hard side.  We all know that carnitas is supposed to be super tender.  Definitely would have been a 4 star rating if the pork was tender, but it wasn't bad at all and it was served with a couple flour tortillas.  The fajitas also smelled and looked delicious as well.    I'd say that Pink Taco is a decent and affordable place to get lunch or dinner at if you're staying in the hotel.",

There are many places just like this throughout Vegas where you can get the exact same food for 75% of the price.  The only differentiation was the guacamole, salsa, and queso trio they offered for their tortilla chips which was quite good.  The main meals were lackluster beyond that.  They had lunch specials but there was nothing exceptionally special about them in terms of price or intrigue.  Unless you are simply craving Mexican, there are many better restaurants in the Hard Rock alone that are better options for lunch.",

We got here about 10 minutes before breakfast closed but they said we could still get it. We were sat and after about 5 minutes no one had come to talk to us. The place was almost empty so it seemed ridiculous that we had to wait. After about 10 minutes my boyfriend asked the hostess if we could order our breakfast. She then had a conference with our server who came over to the table and made a really big deal out of our ordering breakfast. I got French toast and he got carne and eggs. My French toast was ok, luke warm. His food was just ok too but the portion was small for the price. The server never checked on us the entire time we ate. It took a long time to get the bill too! The only great part of our experience was the decor. If you decide to eat at the Hard Rock, do yourself a favor, go to Fuel. The breakfast sandwiches are awesome and the staff are super friendly, hardworking and awesome!",

I was here with a huge party of friends, expecting to have a wild night of margaritas followed by some serious fun at the slot machines. I even gave up my romantic reservation for two at the Paris to share some laughs with the group. Sadly, we all left this craptastic place tired and angry and headed back to our hotels. Thanks for ruining my night, Pink Taco.  My friends asked me to make up some terrible puns to express how horrendous our experience was at this place. Here goes...  *Hairful* what you order. Need I say more?  It was no *enlightening* experience. In fact, we were left *in the dark* about the whole thing. Literally. In the dark on the patio. We had to use the light of our phones to aim our forks in the right direction. Nothing more intimate than eating to the light of an iPhone.  The darkness was a real *buzz*kill. The useless battery-operated candles they gave us lasted about 3 minutes before they set off a high-pitched buzzing noise and then died (except for the ones we threw into the bushes first).  We got a *flush*, but not playing poker... In the bushes next to us, a sudden loud sound of water running was very suspicious. Since we couldn't see anything, theories ranged from someone peeing a heavy stream in the trees to a toilet flushing nearby.  We were the *butt* of someone's joke when they dropped their lit cigarette onto our table from above.  In conclusion, my puns may be awful, but our dining experience was even worse.   They gave us a couple of pitchers of margaritas we didn't ask for and then claimed they \"comped our drinks.\" Uh-huh.  I forgot to mention the food was meh. I didn't get halfway into my chile relleno before a friend pulled a long hair out of his mouth. Aaaaand I'm done.",

    "text": "Sure, Pink Taco is a west coast Mexican food chain, but it sure does taste better than 99% of the shit in New York. So it tasted wonderful to me.   We went for Happy Hour (4PM-7PM) on a Friday. 2 for 1 beers and discounted appetizers.   The Pink Taco Sampler Platter: Chicken Skewers, Carne Asada Skewers, Corn Tamales, Quesadillas, and Shrimp & Ribs.   Verdict: PROPER  Tachos Nachos: Pretty good. Couldn't even finish the platter with 4 dudes.   Verdict: What you say Hammer? PROPER  Taquitos: Fine, it tasted like Taquitos from Costco, but whatever. I'm on vacation in Vegas and these joints are dipping well with the guacamole son. Pleeze believe it.   Total Bill: about $47 bucks with 4 dudes, over 12 beers, and 3 large appetizers. Jigga what? Jigga who?   I'd def. come back to their happy hour.   p.s. - we saw a drunk girl fall off her bar stool and pass out on the floor. quite entertaining. they had to get a medic. it was only 5PM too.",

Good thing we were hungry !!  Sure, it is not an \"authentic\" Mexican place, but ummm, you are in Las Vegas right? Show me one thing here that is authentic and I will hand you that fist full of dollars I showed up with !!  I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here. Chips and salsa showed up promptly, the drink order was a close second and the guacamole was very good. I enjoyed the shrimp tacos (friend shrimp) and my buddies enjoyed their meals as well. Everything served had a very solid showing and the prices were reasonable.  Why 4 stars?  We sat in the open air patio in the back and enjoyed the oasis away from the mob scene found just outside in the casino. What a great way to catch up with some old friends and I am pretty sure one of them will know how to get to Sapphires anyway.",

    "text": "Pink Taco is definitely all you think about when dining here on a Sunday.  The Hard Rock Hotel's big pool party Rehab is on Sundays, and one could get super distracted by all the beefcakes and silicone filled ladies prancing around in their little tiny suits, some with the camel toe that gets your imagination working, and the name of the restaurant then holding some personal meaning.  I did not actually have the pink taco, I ordered the shrimp tacos, and they were delightful.  The chips were home made, fried in the kitchen,  and the salsa was of three varieties, so i could mix and match to make my taste buds curious.  Pitchers of margaritas flowed into the glasses, and one of them even poured onto the table.  The waitress was so kind that when she saw a certain yelpers clumsiness with her pour, she actually replaced the spilled margarita, without us asking.  Our table for 12 was set us super fast, and I'm pretty sure everyone was satisfied with their meals, as well as with the distractions of the scantily clad diners.  This was the least expensive meal I had in Vegas, but never felt like it was a \"cheap\" meal.  I forgot to buy my \"I love Pink Taco\" underwear, but maybe I'll pick up a pair the next time.  I would definitely return here.  Maybe they will open a sister restaurant somewhere in Vegas called the Roast Beef Curtain.... they could specialize in sandwiches, and not pseudo-Mexican food.  Just an idea.",

    "text": "Think Hooters meets Chilis, and you will get a sense of Pink Taco.   This is a formula restaurant that try's to appeal to young men who drink a lot and like Mexican food, and the young woman who are GFs, wives, or looking to be either that follow the men here. Just like hooters is an Owl, Pink Taco is an actual taco dish and not a sexual innuendo. (Yeah, right!)   This is the first location, inside the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel, established in 1999, followed by Scottsdale, AZ and this year in Los Angeles, CA. They are planning to open in San Diego and Huntington Beach in the near future, but had problems with the name  in trying to open up a second Scottsdale location. (They should have tried Tempe!)   The food isn't bad, actually, and the all female hostess/wait staff doesn't wear pink shorts and t-shirts like you would find in Hooters.  The food is better than Hooters, which isn't saying a lot. I tried the chicken and cheese enchiladas, which came with finely shredded chicken stuffed into 3 enchiladas, and covered with half green and half red sauce (my choice) and covered with baked cheese. Rice and beans came on a side plate, all for $12.50 during lunch. Chicken Tostada was $10.75, and the Steak Burrito was $12.25. Soft drinks were $3.00   This could be a fun place to go with your friends when a little drinking and humor are perhaps more important than the food you eat. My buddies come here to sit on the patio and see the hottie and groupie wannabees in their bikinis sun bathing by the pool, while thinking of eating a Pink Taco.",

I was placing an order for take out and the girl at the counter was so rude. She acted as though I was really bothering her and that I was stupid. This is completely unacceptable.  The food at Pink Taco was alright. Not terrible, not that good either. I had the Baja Fish tacos. The plate included three street sized tacos, rice, and beans.  The tacos tasted fine, but the fish inside was measly. Also, the texture on one was totally overcooked and tough.  If you can, skip this place. There are better options at Hard Rock (e.g. Culinary Dropout, Nobu) and much much better options at other hotels.",

There's three different salsas that they bring out with the chips. I personally wasn't a big fan of the salsas, but the chips were fresh and good.  I then ordered the chicken taco which was fair. Definitely nothing special or memorable in my opinion. It was about as basic as tacos could be. It lacked any special flavor and felt more like take out.  This is the type of place you come to after a day of drinking or maybe to grab a quick bite before you start drinking. But it's nothing amazing by any stretch. Food is good, but not that good.",

Instead of selling Vodka soaked Watermelon for $9, beer for $8 and Ant-Man sized tacos for $3....They should have sold beer for $1 and Vodka drenched watermelon for $3 to get you drunk enough to actually enjoy those $3 tacos.",

So Hard Rock Casino recently went gluten free friendly, and almost all of their restaurants offer clearly listed gluten free options. We stayed there recently (family was in town), and I was able to eat plenty of food at each of their restaurants.  Pink Taco's service is great, and I love their outdoor patio seating at the pool. Yes, it's loud because Rehab is a noisy mess of fun, but that's to be expected at one of the best pools in Las Vegas.   Even though I could have eaten everything on their menu, I decided to try their carnitas platter with corn tortillas. Now, carnitas can easily become greasy and overcooked, but the platter at Pink Taco was superb. The portion size was perfect, but I probably could have eaten another half portion because it was so good. Everyone at my table who ordered the carnitas (4 out of 6 people)ate every little last morsel of their carnitas platter and continually said, \"That was the best carnitas I've ever eaten before in my life.\" I agree with them in every way.  What's even better is that they have a huge gluten free friendly menu complete with lobster tacos. ahi tuna and shrimp tacos, salad, nachos and queso fundido. There is nothing on that gluten free menu that I would not want to devour quickly, and we will surely be back to Pink Taco soon.",

A burrito will cost you fifteen or sixteen dollars, just make sure to obtain the backstage pass from the casino, it's free and everything on the menu will be a dollar less. I ordered the supreme burrito challenge not so much for the challenge as that it seemed to be a good deal for $24 (with backstage pass). If you have a couple friends do suggest this dish for a crowd. Cheap for the amount.",

Not much in the way of large menu, so if you're relatively picky (like me), you'll have to spend some time figuring out which item you perceive will be the least altered (and, therefore, frustrating the wait/kitchen staff to accommodate your order).  Food was great, however.  Like most things in a casino/resort, it's about two bucks more than your average Mexican joint, so be aware of that in advance.  Will stop in again.",

The salsa and chips were VERY old, greasy and chewy:(. The chicken nachos (that used to be my personal fave), were thrown at us, barely fitting the plate on the bar, almost falling in our laps, were out in 5 mins, undone, cheese not even melted and stale-unrecognizable really... My friend went to seek the manager-who promptly came over and wanted to \"discuss our experience , while stepping 'outside'\"...and we didn't even have words...We just walked out and left everything.....And they want $7.50 for a Corona and $16 for a bottom-shelf margarita in addition?

They no longer offer the appetizer sampler which was always a favorite among my friends, family & clients.  The homemade chips have been replaced with stale hard chips and 3 different salsa sides have been reduced to just one.  Some of the decor has changed. They have removed some of the overhead lighting with corny track lighting along the wall. The prices have also increased yet portions are much smaller. Margarita glasses are now served in a water glass rather than usual margarita glass.  I'm hoping things will return to how they used to be...Stat!",

Service was fine both times and the chips and salsa were very good too. If you're daring with salsa, ask for their \"diablo\" or their hot salsa. It's pretty spicy and my personal taste prefers an in-between Diablo or something in their second hottest salsa. I like spicy stuff and have been complimented by Asians and Mexicans alike. It's probably because my parents weren't into spicy food and I love it. Heck I can probably drink shots of tabasco sauce but that's another story.  We enjoyed their food.. had a quesadilla, guacamole and of course the margaritas. If we are at HRH again, we'll hit this place again!",

    "text": "I think this is my new favorite Happy hour place in Vegas!  The Pink Taco is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel.  We got a great deal for $40 a night the last time we were in Vegas.  $40!  Can you believe it?  Anyways, let's get down to the review of this place!  We checked into the Hard Rock at around 3 pm and our group met up in the Hard Rock lobby at 5 pm.  While walking to the front desk, we noticed that there was a Pink Taco, so that is where we decided to go for Happy Hour.  4.5 hour drives and 90+ degree weather definitely had us craving for some discounted alcohol.  We were immediately seated at the bar.  Service was good!  I wouldn't say all that attentive, but they get you in and out without too much delay.  Between Andrew D. and I, we spent about $30 ish.  And boy did we get a BUTTload of food!  We were full for the rest of the day!  Happy Hour Items: 1.  Chicken Nachos (This would have been enough for the both of us to share.  We didn't know how big the portions were until they came out, but it's a BIG plate of nachos!  You'll love it! Hot and cheesy and crunchy with lots of toppings! You NEED to get this if you come to Happy Hour and it's SO cheap...$5-$6 i believe)  2.  Steak Quesadilla (This is a pretty big portion as well!  It came with a generous side of guacamole and sour cream)  3.  4 beers!!  They had this happy hour deal where you can buy 1 beer and get the second free.  4.  3 fish Tacos (We ordered this from the regular menu because we weren't sure how big the portions for the machos and quesadillas were.  This came with 3 yummy fish tacos with beans and rice- big boy sized plate as well).  So you see??? All those items for $30 ish!  It was a GREAT deal!  They also serve you tortilla chips and give you 3 little sauces to dip your chips in and they are DELICIOUS!  We all definitely left that place jolly and full!    Is there a Pink Taco located on this strip?  It's too bad it's located so far away, but other than that; I would definitely come back for their great happy hour deal! :)",

After a day of non-stop gambling and drinking at the Hard Rock what could sound better than a monstrous burrito and Corona. First off, the hostess, servers, waiters, etc... all recognize the average customer is at least half-in-the-bag and they keep a fun and lively atmosphere going as a result, so it's a fun place. The food is also served in enormous portions and it's pretty damn good... especially when all your body needs is some carbs and grease to get right back on track. If you're a guest at the Hard Rock and need a quick pick me up after a hard day of partying, don't put too much drunk thought into it, just roll into Pink Taco and enjoy.",

I had the namesake Pink Taco (Panuchos) which has black beans, avacado, pickled onions, grilled chicken and salsa roja.
