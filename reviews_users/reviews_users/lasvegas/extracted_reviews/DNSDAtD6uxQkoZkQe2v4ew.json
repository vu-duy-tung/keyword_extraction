I've tried a number of dishes both for lunch and dinner and everything has been great. However, you must try the lamb shank - this is the best ever. Hats off to chef Ritesh Patel for this dish. The other good news is that the restaurant has a full bar and nice wine selection. The staff is international and very friendly. You can find American, Indian and European servers joining forces together to provide an excellent customer service.",

Went alone for lunch and had the saag aloo, the chana  masala, the vegan roti and  rice. .... and STILL spent less than $20 w tax! The food was very mild to \"no hot\" spices just like I liked it. I could actually taste the freshness and the flavors and not struggle to do so. Amazing hands down! It's tucked away in an unlikely shopping center so be sure to keep your eyes open when trying to find it. But honey chile  get you some of this....every table around me is complementing the food. Of course, I'm coming back to make sure it ain't a one time fluke lol. Great romantic spot too....bring your boo thing on date night!! And  thank me later ha ha ha!",

    "text": "For starters, we were quite impressed with the decor, a mixture of traditional and modern.  Great lighting, too. It has a large patio, not quite set up yet, but it was way too hot to eat outside anyway.    I asked about a wine list, and our waiter, Navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds (along with a few beers).  I'm a white wine drinker, but can't handle either of the two, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.  They honestly get me sick.  He offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything I wanted.  I was going to skip the wine (horrors!), but the owner came out.  He explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  Though I posted a pic of the current list, I'm going to remove it.  I don't think it's fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.  The owner, Ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  We thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  He insisted that Navi go get the wine I wanted, so I acquiesced. I was a happy camper.  The menu is so atypical of the usual Indian restaurant.  It's very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  Ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  He will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.  We started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  I don't think I've ever seen corn in an Indian restaurant before.  They were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual Chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  I'm not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  The creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.  For our mains we shared a Saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  We ordered both of our dishes medium-spicy, and that's how it was.  Along with that we got Baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of Saag. The garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced FRESH garlic. Last time we had it, at a different place, I couldn't even see or taste garlic.  As it was, I could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling Samosas, but then, I'm not a very big eater.  We'll have my very favorite meal - leftovers - tonight.  As if the great food and phenomenal service weren't enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  Our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast Herb for his birthday.  He said \"Oh, is it your birthday?\"  I told him it had actually been two days before.  But when we finished packing up the leftovers, Navi and Ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share - their beautiful Kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.  Even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and I wish Curry Leaf a long and prosperous life.",

I took the food home, then I realized there was no utensils given with the food. I thought maybe it's because I was eating 'indian' food, and it's their tradition, but they could have asked me at least. Well I still had forks at home, so I managed to eat it.  The food itself was alright. It was decent tasting, but it was very oily. By the end of my food, all I had left was oil. I might try another indian food next time.",

    "text": "It won't take a psychic to see more Indian dinners in my future now that there's a quality spot around these parts.  I was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside \"spot\" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.  My wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish \"hot\" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.     The $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entree.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.  I am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "Flavors are on point here at Curry Leaf. No buffet, just a la carte entrees, apps, sides, and desserts. I stuck to some fairly safe favorite dishes and found them all to be of great quality with deep, complex flavors. Ambiance is going for an upscale feel but pricing is reasonable.  SAAG PANEER: Pure vegetarian Indian comfort, with unusually creamy and plentiful paneer. Pairs fabulously with the garlic naan (which was deliciously fragrant and beautifully blistered), this is my preferred meal. ROGAN JOSH: BF's pick, ordered medium, with a spicy and flavorful sauce. Lamb was in large, plentiful chunks but could have been more tender. Both main dishes included rice. BAINGAN BHARTA: Side of tandoori-smoked eggplant mash was contender for my favorite dish, with great smoky flavor and good texture. A bargain at $6/side. KULFI TRIO: We couldn't resist dessert, and the house-made ice creams fulfilled out sweets craving with a bright mango flavor, sweet raspberry, and nutty pistachio. Couldn't pick a favorite as they were all good, with great creamy consistency.   Interior is upscale with modern (but slightly uncomfortable) chairs and a large bar area (but no alcohol license?), makes for an intimate date-night dinner spot. Unclear whether they plan to expand seating into the adjacent patio area. Service was attentive and polite throughout.   This is one of those places I would come back and get the exact same meal, rather than trying more on the menu. They do the classic dishes extremely well and the portions were generous. Great option for a vegetarian meal.",

And on asking the server about it, he said it's easy and tried to cut it a couple of times where it slipped sideways, at which point I don't know if his intention was to stab someone. But, kudos! He succeeded. I commend his perseverance, but am not fond of the idea of ingesting a brick.",

    "text": "Owned and operated by the dedicated Chef Ritesh Patel, this establishment hits home runs on all 3 major fronts. Quality, Service & Ambiance. Must mention that the presentation of the dishes was appetizing as well. This is a well run restaurant with knowledgeable and engaging staff.  Melica, it was a delight having ongoing food related discussions with you. You are a lot of fun and that helped make our visit very comfortable.  Lamb Seekh Kebabs - Had this dish as an appetizer and, at first bite, we knew that the chef had the control over the Tandoor oven and preparation of its dishes. Kebabs were spiced to our liking and paired really well with the Merlot.  Roghan Josh - Prepared and spiced just right. It's creamy texture balanced with succulent cubes of lamb was overwhelmingly delicious. Portion was generous and we fought to share at the table. It made the Merlot's day.  Chicken Tandoori - This dish at one time, used to be the pride of the Indian Cuisine. The advent of Buffets and the dish's inclusion in it by unskilled chefs has diluted its value over time. This is my all time favorite Indian dish and CURRY LEAF absolutely delighted me with its flavors and tenderness. This dish was finger licking good. The Merlot saw its last drops vanish.  Gulab Jamun w/ Vanilla Ice Cream - Nice combination. Perfectly satisfied the sweet tooth in me. A dessert item that closes the entire experience very well.  NOTE: Curry Leaf Flavors of India is away from the Las Vegas Strip. It's approximately 13 miles or 20 minutes in the Spring Valley area of Las Vegas. Uber/Lyft can get you there for about $20 one-way from the Las Vegas Strip. It is worth the trip. Now, if you live in the Spring Valley / Summerlin area then you are already near this gem.",

We were looking for a place for dinner today, and finally landed on this piece of culinary heaven. We ordered the somosas, the (free) onion appetizer you get for checking in, and the chicken korma. By the way, if you've never strayed from the regular Indian curry dishes (tikka masala, butter chicken), I highly recommend you get the Korma. It is creamy, and slightly nutty. Every bite of the evening was an explosion of flavor that left me wanting more.   I will definitely be visiting this spot again, SOON!",

I'm primarily a vegetarian, but I will occasionally eat a little meat and had to try some of his chicken dishes.  I'll start with the appetizers:  Chili Panner: Think of chunks of smooth cheese, almost cheese-curd like, in a sauce similar to Kung Pao, but obviously more complex.  DELICIOUS!  This will become a regular item for me  Chicken 65:  Chunks of fried chicken in a thick tikka masala-like sauce.  Need I say more?   Naan:  Solid good ol' garlic naan  Entrees...  He had the Chicken Tikka Masala which is of course a fairly common dish for us Caucasians, but it was above average.  Huge chunks of white meat chicken in an aromatic fragrant sauce.    I had the Dal Makhani which is sort of like an Indian Chili with lentils and red beans.  MIND BLOWN!  This was soooooo amazing.  I ate almost the whole portion which can be dangerous if you eat a large amount of Lentils lol, but I couldn't stop.    I badly wanted to try the Choco Naan, but there just wasn't any room, so next time.",

Others in our group had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chili Chicken. We also ordered sweet naan and garlic naan for the table. Everything was really great and flavorful. The waiter's suggestions on how spicy we should order were on point. The only reason this place isn't 5 stars is because the Chicken Tikka Masala tasted very different from what we had tried in London and we didn't like it as much. I would definitely still come back though!",

When you walk inside the place is beautiful, spotless and the decor is really nice. Nothing like any Indian place in town.   The food is excellent in taste and quality. I had a Cucumber salad to start us off and it was so tasty because of the dressing. They took time to cut up the vegetables and it was presented beautifully.   Chicken Vindaloo curry and chicken tikka masala curry medium were so full of flavor we were both surprised. If chunks of white meat chicken as well. Plain rice came with both and we ordered a side of lemon rice. First time ever I have had a side rice that actually tasted of what they said it was. Light and fluffy yellow and tasted of lemon. Not over powering but you knew.   Two beers and a glass of wine with garlic naan bread that was awesome and it was 60 dollars, a really good deal for a lot of food.   Smaller menu than any Indian place we have seen which is nice. Too many places have ten page menus and there is no way you can make that many dishes well. Smaller menu means quality and it showed.   If you like Indian food you have to try this place.   We need to support our local owned restaurants. Chains are a dime a dozen and places like this are so nice to have you wont be disappointed.",

Came here with my boyfriend to try something new and saw good reviews on here. Unfortunately I have Celiac so can't have any gluten. We called ahead and asked, the dude on the phone said no gluten - no problem. So we went.  And we are both blown away.  After letting the (super sweet and attentive) waiter know I'm gluten free, we started with the chili paneer. When it came out we noticed it was breaded so I got scared for a second; then out of the blue the Chef and owner Ritesh comes to the table, introduces himself and says 'Don't worry about the breading, I used rice and chickpea flour for you so it would be gluten free.' WOW! Such dedication to great service.  The chili paneer was absolutely unbelievable and so were our entrees (Chicken Tikka Marsala, Paneer Vindaloo, and sides of yellow Dal and eggplant).  We will definitely be back and I cannot recommend this place enough. Whether you're gluten free or not, the food here is so fantastic and the staff and owner are so amazing that you're missing out if you don't give it a try!!",

I personally went to dozens of Indian restaurant in different state but I like the food of this restaurant the most.   Their kadaai paneer is best. We also tried samosa and paneer chilly in starter and they are fabulous. They also have bar and if you are mojito lover then you should try it over here. It was great.  So if you are hungry and want some Indian food and this restaurant is 2 hour far from you then also you should go for it, because its worth it.",

    "text": "Experience:  my friend Lance (check out his review on here) tried this place an raved about the food. So he invited a few friends to come try it out. We came around 7:00 for dinner.   Facility: beautiful!  This is a very upscale, modern decor with heavy Indian influence. So beautifully done!!! They have tables and chairs, bar seating, and some booths. They have some outside seating coming soon too!  I loved being able to look around and having some things to look at...from the Ballywood-esque mural, to the beautiful window treatments. I have to mention the seats were pretty comfortable too, which is rare in a restaurant.   Service:  This is the only reason, I'm marking them down. Otherwise they would have a 5 star from me. They are very polite servers; however, the first thing we ordered, was my cheese naan and the eggplant. This was my main meal. The cheese naan was the last thing that came out, after asking 4 times for it.  I was actually full eating other folks food by the time I got it. One waitress I questioned on the status said they didn't even have cheese naan, although it was on the menu. Then she brought another Garlic naan instead. When they finally brought my naan, they said the extra garlic naan they brought by mistake was on them.  Of course!  How about comping my cheese naan instead!  They also took forever to bring out another friends Chicken Marsala. Hopefully they get it together soon. I do love how personable the staff was, and the owner even came out to greet and talk to us.  Food:  A-maz-ing!  I love Indian food and this did not disappoint.  Everything we had was good...honestly, there was nothing I disliked. We ordered a lot, so I will try to remember all we ordered. We asked for everything very hot on the spicy scale.  Cheese naan - 5/5 so good and cheesy!!! Garlic naan - 5/5 hot and fresh! Basmati rice - we had order rice to go along with our meals, as it's not included. It was cooked perfectly.  Chili Paneer - 6/5 yep, that good!  It had a great chili sauce it was tossed in, and was crispy outside, with a creamy, cheesy middle. Yum!!! Murgh Tikka Trio - 4/5 every piece of chicken was spiced well and still juicy in the middle. I did find myself adding more sauce though.  Samosa - 4/5 loved, but the cheese corn was not my fav.  I loved the potato the most and then the pea. They were all crispy, hot and good! Baingan Bharta - the eggplant dish I ordered - 5/5 so yum with a nice texture from the pop of the peas. I loved the flavor and this went well with the naan  Chicken Saag - 5/5 great flavors, tender chicken.  Madras - 5/5 we ordered the lamb for this one...it was my favorite. It was creamy and loaded with flavor. Loved to dip my naan in the sauce too!!! Chicken Tikka Marasala - 5/5 this was the spiciest of our dishes with an amazing flavor *I also wished they offered something complimentary, such as naan with a full meal or even the rice with a big order such as ours.  I hate when places make you order every piece of the meal to make it a meal.   Overall: I do realize, they are brand new and still working on their groove, so I'm definitely willing to come back in a month or so, and hope they got it all together, so I can bump to a 5. Because the food is already there!!!!! Come try it out!  It's delicious!!!",

A real shame, lol.  Unfortunately, it seems I'm 15 minutes away from any Indian restaurant. Of three top contenders, I ended up siding with curry leaf.  I called in to make my order of lamb Tikka masala with basmati rice and garlic naan - the classic. It only had a 15 minute wait, just about the time it would take to drive there.  It was easy to park and there was no fuss to pick up my order - very smooth. After what seemed like a very long drive back home smelling tantalizing aromas, I finally got to dig in.  First off, they did a good job packing everything. No spillage or anything like that. Taste was excellent. Lamb was very tender, and the curry was flavorful. I ordered medium, and it was at the appropriate heat level. Rice did its job soaking up curry, and garlic naan cleaned up well too.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would order again.",

The staff was very nice and the atmosphere is casual and very relaxing. India food can be very good or very bad. There has not been a time where it hit kinda in the middle for me. This place was excellent, traditional and fresh. Spice levels felt True to description and everything was balanced. I would have like my rice to just a little warmer but my Lamb Korma was really hot so it did not make a big difference. After we were settling the check I checked in on yelp and I received a notification for a free rice pudding. The waiter was very nice and asked if I wanted it to go. A few hours later I lifted the lid off my little yelp Curry Leaf present and it was topped with sprinkles which I love almost as much as glitter. The rice pudding was delicious. Creamy and tender rice with toasted cardamom pods. Spicy, Creamy, Sweet!!! It was a Lovely way to end my work day.",

I came here during lunch with friends and we each got something to share. We got the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Fish Curry and Saag and all were absolutely delicious! There was lots of flavor in each dish. Spice levels were on point (I only get 2-3 because I can't handle spicy). Prices were reasonable and I look forward to coming back here. If you're looking for good Indian food, this is the place to check out!",

Good service; birthday girl waitress informed us she will be leaving for the night but the others can assist. No delay in any wait. Water glasses filled without asking.  Chana masala was okay. The chickpeas were whole.  Decent serving bowl size. Seems best to eat it with naan. Flavor spice was 3 that tasted more like 1. Weren't sure with the spice level here as other places seem to vary with what is considered spicy.   Lamb tikka masala extremely excellent! Could boost up the spice level in this one too. Nicely paired with mushroom rice. Would definitely order this again and highly recommend this dish. With the sauce left over makes perfect for naan scooping. This holds the highest rank of what we ordered for dinner.  Mushroom rice... really good. Seemed a little moist than expected, but rice wasn't stuck together. Rice has several choices other than mushroom to include in ordering rice.  Garlic naan was semi burnt. The puffy parts of the bread looked like burnt bubbles. Still finished it since the bottom was edible and garlic flavor was still present on the taste buds.  Indian flavor score 4.5****. Was thinking how much more better fresh cooked food tasted than the ready mades I usually purchase for my easy lunches. Yeah this place gets my vote for a return visit.",

My knowledge of Indian food was limited to the curries, but I have never been much of a curry fan - so I skipped over Indian food in general.  I saw Curry Leaf on Instagram and they had some lamb dishes that intrigued me. So my husband and I went!  We told our server we had never had Indian food and our server was great and gave us some suggestions and seemed excited to share with us. That made us feel a lot more comfortable, so if you don't know what to get - don't feel awkward asking!  One of the other servers who was refilling our drinks was also amazing, we mentioned it being our first experience and he was so passionate sharing his favorites. It made us excited to come back and try more dishes.  We started with the fried cauliflower (gobi manchurian) and my husband got Dum biryani with lamb, which was a rice dish in a small pot with a Naan like cover . I got Lamb Nihari (lamb shank). They had a lamb chop appetizer that pictures look amazing of - and I should have gotten that too. I wish it was a dinner option. We got Gulab Jamun for dessert which might have been the best thing ever. It is a must have.  We will definitely be back",

I was excited to try this place. The wine isn't worth your money it's cheap brand so skip that but the food is DELICIOUS! The garlic naan was perfect. My boyfriend and I split the Madras Lamb and Chicken Tikka Massala. We LOVE spicy foods but we're not accustomed to Indian spice. We ordered it medium and that had barely any spice at all, they were still flavorful and delicious but if you like spice order it hot.  We were disappointed in the lack of spice even in the middle spice range.  I'll come back 100% I highly recommend this place. The chicken was tender and juicy, not dry at all and the flavor was there but lacking spice.. ( have I said that enough ? Haha)   My only reason besides the spice for a 4:5 instead of 5/5 is my napkin was stained with grease and that's really off putting.  Please toss any greasy stained napkins that even through the wash won't be clean again...  I WILL be back and I love it already. Just toss bad napkins and when I come back and order spicy I bet this will be a five star rating... The customer service was wonderful, nicest staff I've seen in a long time. They make you happy and comfortable thank you for the great food and service!",

Answered all of our questions and was very detailed when explaining things. I'm super picky when it comes to Indian food, but I'm so happy we tried this location. Also they can make any dish vegetarian or vegan!!! Which is something I look for in a restaurant. I am definitely coming back!!!!",

    "text": "This is a great place. Second time visiting.   First time we tried the samosas. They have the appetizer set up so you can sample three different kinds of samosas. Girlfriend  and I enjoyed all three.   Shrimp was really good! Perfect spice, really great sauce. Get spicy #6!!!!  Chicken Tikka masala is alright. I think the chicken was a bit overcooked on my serving, but sauce was good. Tastes good when you combine it with yogurt and garlic naan.   Dessert is gulab Jaman as we always get. They are dough balls drenched in cardamom  syrup. The syrup isn't too sweet like some other Indian places we go to. No wonder she likes them  jk.jk..lol    Now for service. Our server was ok. She seemed new so I gave her a break. She needs to be more aware placement of the plates while she cleared the table. Also should watch water glass more closely. Had to wait for water from after I finished appetizers to after I finished main course . It's ok though because they are a nice staff.   Overall, definitely coming back to this place For a third time",

This was actually an order for just two people, with a little bit of left overs.  My boyfriend wanted to stand up and applaud every time he took a Gobi bite.  Regarding the SERVICE... Our waiter Elmer was OUTSTANDING!  We asked questions about the menu and he was very knowledgeable and attentive while taking our order.  Sometimes waiters make you feel rushed but Elmer was on point!  I know service can throw a review off but don't get it twisted... the food was amazing!!  We all know service can be a crap shoot sometimes but if you're willing to gamble in exchange for good food... COME HERE!",

    "text": "Based off all the good yelp reviews I thought this place must be amazing...  I was wrong... and my husband and i left very disappointed with stomach pains.    1- MEAL WAS FLAVORLESS:   I'm not exaggerating when i say our food was bland / completely flavorless. Our order (Saag Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala) was the worst I've ever had.   2 - CHEF TOOK HIS LUNCH BREAK DURING OUR MEAL:   Overall Service was terrible, the chef decided to take his lunch break during our meal! My husband and I are big fans of Indian cuisine and knew exactly what we wanted when our waiter arrived. We placed our order and ordered rice pudding for dessert all at the same time and requested that the waiter bring dessert at the end of the meal.   After forcing ourselves to finish the flavorless main dishes we informed the waiter to bring dessert. That's when he casually says he \"can't\" and \"sorry\" because the chef took a break and is over at the bar eating... right in front of us! Terrible!   3- WE GOT SICK:   The last and most important part of our experience ...  Shortly into the meal I began having stomach cramps but didn't say anything to my husband about it because i didn't want to put that in the air. Once we left he gets to the car and says he has bad stomach pains!   We both ended up having stomach aches overnight, highly unusual.   I DONT RECCOMEND :   This place provided us with our worst dining experience ever and I don't know how so many people rated it highly.   My husband and I love Indian Cuisine and have dined at some amazing places around the country so we know what flavor and quality to expect. We've been in Las Vegas for 9 months now and hadn't gone to an Indian restaurant yet , so that was our 1st Indian food experience in Las Vegas.   Disappointed but not discouraged, we'll try again elsewhere.",

It was my first time here, I noticed the outside looked simple and when I walked in, I was 'Wowed' by the ambiance, it was very modern and beautiful.   The hostess wanted to seat me at a table and I requested a booth. She wasn't happy and says something like 'just for 1 person..?!!' As I walked closer I noticed the booths were quite big and sits 4 people. I did felt bad that I asked for a booth but I never had a problem asking for a booth before in other places.   Anyways, I asked if they had Goat curry, she said they don't. Most Indian restaurants would cook it even though not listed on the menu. But that's ok. I was going to get Korma with Lamb. She recommended Rogan Josh.  The food came out in 15 mins, not too bad on the wait. The dish came with a small bowl of rice and they were ok. I have had better. I thought it was pricey being $16 the portion was small compared to other restaurants. I do really like Rose Lassi.  The restaurant were really nice but the restrooms needs work, some nooks and corners looked run down and the latch to the door almost didn't open for me. For a moment, I thought I was locked in LOL!  The manager checked up on me and is very nice. I had a quick dinner like 30 mins and left.",

Servers did not tell us what they were setting down on our table, mind you this was our first time eating here. Took a while for my boyfriend to receive his entree and when the server came to put down our entrees he told us that I ate food that was not mine and gave me my actual curry bowl. The way he said it made me feel bad for eating it, when I didn't even know what it was because no one said what the dishes were. We never received our sides nor did we see any effort in receiving it. We asked all Front of the house employees for our bill and waited for 20 minutes to actually receive it.   Rice must be cooked to order because we never got it for our actual entrees. We took a couple bites of our Curry's and they were one dimensional. There's better Indian food spots out there that know how to cook the cuisine.",

    "text": "Wow...this has to be one of my worst dining experiences.   Service was awful. The waiter barely checked on us. As someone who works at a very busy restaurant, I understand how stressful things can be on a server. But to not check on us until we have been finished for over 20mins is unacceptable.  Upon being seated, we had another server, who made a weird face upon greeting us...probably because we had a faint smell of herb. I'm guessing he didn't want to serve African Americans that smelled of herb (he most likely made some general stereotypes about us). So instead of following through with us, he decided we were a waste of his time. So he sent another server to assist us instead.   This other amateur server immediately came out of character after taking our order. He wasn't professional as he was with all of his other Caucasian tables. He even said \"fuck\" a few times while conversing with us. Also very unacceptable.   Chicken Tikka wasn't authentic at all. When I asked for a side of the Tikka masala sauce it was bland and not spicy at all (level 5).   By the looks of it this is NOT an authentic Indian place. I saw no Indian staff members. This is place probably where white people go to enjoy Indian food in the comfort of their own kind.   Save yourself a trip and don't go!!",

I wish I would have ordered a lot spicier the 5 had no kick. It honestly felt very mild. The salmon was excellent other then me wishing for more spice. The chicken wasn't soft like I'm used to from other Indian places. It was honestly very chewy and tough. However, the flavor to the tikka masala was on point. I was again disappointed with the 5 spice level but that's my fault so no blame there. I know next time to order spicier. My last reasoning for the 3 star rating is the naan was burnt.  it was so amazing other then the fact it was a touch over cooked. I know they have potential to be amazing. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best experience for me. Maybe it'll be better next time.",

My favorite here is the lentil soup made with curry powder.. best lentil soup in town. I visit this place every few months.  The curry bowls here are very tasty. I tried the Aloo Gobi, Madras, and Kofta. The Aloo Gobi is very flavorful and I loved it. I also tried the vindaloo and marasala here on previous visits but didn't like it so much, there are local spots that does it better in my opinion.  One thing I'd say is that the portion size is very small. For around 16 bucks you order a meat vindaloo dish and you get a small bowl of curry and rice. Wouldn't stop me from coming back for the Aloo Gobi and Lentil Soup though.",

The food was refreshing and the spice was just right. The food was colorful and unique.  Service wise was not bad, food took long to come but it was worth the wait. The service made you feel welcome. I'll definitely be more open to Indian dish. Everything they had were made from fresh ingredients, and you can definitely taste it.",

Haven't eaten Indian since for about 3 yrs. always wanted to try it again and I'm glad I did and this was the place.  Walked in and had a seat right away. It was 5pm. Our server was attentive the whole time. Made really great suggestions like the  Chili Paneer shrimp is was so tasty And chicken tikki was just really flavorful for not being spicy at all. We requested mild. The garlic naan is always perfect with curry dishes.  Highly recommend this place for great food and awesome service",

The drinks were 10% off so of course, we had to try something! I got the guava margarita and it was delicious! The sweetness and the amount of tequila was perfect. We ordered the trio of samosas that comes with two types of sauces. The size of the samosas were smaller than other places I've been too but all 3 types were good. For our main dishes we got chicken tikka masala, lamb korma and garlic naan. Both came with basmati rice. The portions were a good size and both were delicious! Naan was crispy and very flavorful.   My only complaint was their service. It took a little over 30 minutes just to get our appetizer out and maybe another 20 for our main dishes. It took another 20 minutes just to flag someone down to give us our checks. One waitress was very nice and apologized and explained they were short staffed because of the holidays but everyone was doing the best they could.",

I think overall the food gets 4 but had to knock it down to a 3 as the Tiki Masala was so dry I had to steal some of the curry sauce from my wife's sea bass to moisten it enough to eat. The service was extremely slow, it took 45 minutes to get our food. Maybe Indian cuisine takes longer to prepare? Price was fair and the host was pleasant. I do not think we will return as my wife was less impressed than myself. I find myself a fair critic of food but the overall experience and lack of service deserve 3 stars at most. My advice is skip this joint and opt for the Thai place up the street for a better experience.",

I called late in the afternoon for pick up after their dinner opening time.  I ordered the trio of samosas called Samosa Teen Tarike.  One was filled with green peas, one with potato, and one with paneer and corn.  The pastry was light and fried perfectly and the fillings were very tasty.  I really didn't need the sauces that were packed with them--a mint sauce and a tamarind sauce.  Both were good.  For mains, I ordered chicken tikka masala for my wife--spice level mild--and I got the Madras curry with chicken and spice level hot.  Both were well done and the sauces were mild and hot as we both wanted.  We got two containers of basmati rice with the curries.  I got a double order of garlic naan and it was as good as the first time I was here.  The order was packed perfectly for the short ride home and everything was hot when I opened the containers.  A word about service.  Navi took my payment and offered me a glass of water at the bar while I waited.  Mr. Patel, the owner, came out to speak with me as he had done when I was there before.  He is a very genial man and he lets his passion for his restaurant and the quality of the food he serves come out.  We chatted a bit about the patio being opened soon as the weather is cooling. I'll be returning often.  Again, I say I'm glad they're a short drive from home and I'll be back.",

I ordered aloo matter which is not on the menu but the cooked it anyway - no hassle.  Were it not for price I'd give them five stars. Still we continue to go because there's not much competition. Only other comment - it's very fresh which I think impacts the flavor. It actually tastes better the next day so buy extra and bring it home!",

Everything was so amazing that I've been back 4 more times and I've introduced 3 other friends to Curry Leaf.  It's kind of hidden in a small collection of stores across the street from the Walmart super center. I can't imagine how busy they would be if they had more exposure. The interior has a fun Indian vibe. The menu is kind of small but oh so good. I've tried a few other Indian restaurants in Vegas and absolutely hated them so I'm glad Curry Leaf broke the bad streak.  With most meals they offer Nan bread and I always choose the Garlic Nan. It is so good that I could eat a whole meal of just Nan. Dip that Nan in your Lamb or chicken dish and it's even better.  They offer some unique beers that you won't find at other establishments as well as wine and non alcoholic beverages.  They ask you how hot you would like your dish when you order and if it's not hot enough you can always get some hot sauce or pepper on the side.  Just talking about Curry leaf makes me want to go there tomorrow.",

For dessert I had a rice pudding and my husband had Gulab jamun wig vanilla ice cream, which is fried milk cakes soaked in saffron and cardamom syrup. Which were both delicious desserts. Our server recommended our entrees and desserts. She was so helpful asking us questions about we we liked, so she suggested to us the curry entrees. She also mentioned we could have it as spicy as we wanted or no spice. She was so sweet very helpful. We will definitely go back there again for dinner.",

I explained to him that I was vegan and he quickly made sure I was aware of any item I could and couldn't have. My boyfriend ordered naan for himself but Elmer made sure to remind me that it wasn't vegan. While waiting for our meal, Elmer came out with a second order of naan saying that he had a special Vegan order of naan made for me to enjoy.  I thought this was such a sweet and over the top gesture. Being someone with high dietary restrictions, it brings so much joy to my day when someone actually cares and is concerned with your needs in a meal. He constantly checked in with us to make sure we enjoyed and allowed me to add in garbanzo beans to my korma for extra protein. The food was incredible and the service was superb. So happy I finally found a go to Indian restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "Uh where do I start. I don't know how this place has so many high stars. Unfortunately our experience was not pleasant when we attended. I really wanted this place to work out & was looking forward to having an Indian food restaurant so close to work. I made a reservation ahead of time since we were a group of 8. Upon arrival there is no hostess & it's an awkward entry as you have to round the corner & look for staff to direct you. As another Yelper wrote there is a huge language barrier with one of the waitresses. On the evening I was there it was only her & a male employee (acting as mgr) working. There was one other table with 5 people (that came in far after us but got their food 1st) & a couple of booths with 2 people each. I had explained to the waitress that we would be doing separate checks & that was not a problem per the waitress (or the reservation taker). We waited for all in our party to arrive. The waitress started to take the orders & by the time she took about 4 of the orders we could tell she didn't understand what separate checks meant as she was writing everything down on one piece of paper mixing appetizers with entrees of separate diners. I tried to explain to her again that we wanted separate checks & in the middle of me explaining she ran off. So only part of our table had our orders in. We waited thinking she'd be right back but soon came to realize that she was just ignoring us. She started taking orders out for other tables. We literally waited 15 minutes for her to come back to the table to continue our orders. She wouldn't make eye contact & neither would the male waiter. We really should have left at that point but we really wanted to try this place. We finally got her back to the table & got all the other orders in. From the time we started ordering to the time we got it completed it was 30 minutes (I looked at my watch it was 6:21pm when we started & 6:51pm when we were finished.) A couple of our diners ordered beers in which it took her over 20 minutes to get. She was looking through the cooler trying to figure out what a blue moon was. One of our diners that ordered the beer went to the bar to ask her what the hold up was. At that time it became a joke at the table as to how long it would take to get beers meanwhile the other beer sat out on the counter getting warm for our other diner. It took her forever to key in the orders (like she didn't know how to use the p.o.s.) After we finally got the beers & were waiting & waiting for the food to come out we called over the male server who was \"acting manager\" for the evening & explained to him what was going on asked where our food was since it had been a long time. He tried to tell us that it was taking so long because we had ordered separate checks & that they make all their food from scratch. I literally said back to him \"well I would hope you would make your food from scratch.\" He was trying to argue with us about the situation instead of trying to smooth it over. I told him that we understand that separate checks to take longer but not this long. Again - he was just argumentative. He asked if we would like the food to come all at once or as it was ready. Are you kidding me? So if we decided to say all at once so we could all eat together then some of us would have our food sitting under warmers while others were hot off the stove. We opted to have the dishes arrive as they were ready hoping they would be all hot (but they weren't.) We were all starving & we asked if we could at least get some naan while we waited. It never came out but instead came when people's meals started arriving. And we were charged for it on top of all the horrible service we received. We tried all 3 of the naans as well as the stuffed naan & they were not worth the $. The garlic naan has no garlic flavor. (Mint Indian Bistro or Taj Palace have far better garlic naan.) The kitchen isn't on their game when it comes to the spiciness level of their foods. Some people ordered their dishes mild but they had great kick while others dishes were bland & no taste when ordered mild. Another diner ordered his medium & it was horribly spicy. No one was impressed with their dishes. Price point to the size of dish is too high in my opinion compared to other Indian restaurants. None of us will ever be back. As I stated I really had high hopes for this place because I love Indian food & it was close to work. Unfortunately it fell completely short.",

We ordered the samosas and the chili paneer for apps. The samosas were good but not anything overly exciting. The chili paneer, however, was delicious! I mean, it's hard to go wrong with fried cheese smothered in chili sauce. The sauce, by the way, was pure magic. Our entrees were perfectly spiced. I was told the chef that night was \"timid\" with spice so I ordered my lentil soup and vegetarian dish spicy. It definitely had quite a kick but not so much that I couldn't taste my food. If the less timid chef is working I would probably stick to medium spice level. We also had a lamb dish- rogan josh, I believe, and korma with shrimp. Both entrees had complex and wonderful flavor and the lamb was so tender it was falling apart. The service was a bit slow and lacking but I'm not knocking them for it because there were only 2 servers and they were  swamped. They were hustling for sure.   Prices were about average and the atmosphere was cozy. Was this authentic Indian food? To be honest, I wouldn't know. Was it delicious?  Yes. Yes it was. Better than any place we have tried back home in San Diego. Glad to see Vegas isn't all corporate chains and mediocre food!",

    "text": "Good Indian food is difficult to find. It is often Americanized, made spicy, rather than with a mix of wonderful spices. Well, if Curry Leaf is as good as what I had tonight, there is at least one go to spot for Indian food. I had the traditional Murgh Makhani. Since I am lactose intolerant, I asked to make it without dairy. The waiter returned with the good news that the chef would accommodate. Man did he ever. The chicken was cooked perfectly. In the red sauce I tasted, new flavors as each second passed. The waiter said be prepared to have your mind blown. He was not kidding. This was the best tasting Indian dish, I have ever eaten. I also had Jeera Aloo, which are roasted potatoes made with many different spices. This was less successful, although still extremely tasty and well worth trying. The rice was also cooked perfectly. I am not a fan of bread, so I can not comment on the roti.  The atmosphere exuded calm. The colors simple but felt at home, perfect for a modern Indian restaurant. I look forward to sampling all that Curry Leaf has to offer. The food is extraordinary. The only knock is it is a bit pricey. But if you want Indian food at its finest, you will not mind paying the few extra dollars",

    "text": "It's been nearly impossible to find a good Indian place in Las Vegas, but I think I finally found it!  I stopped in for my lunch break because I work nearby and have been meaning to try it since I saw it open recently.  I sat at the bar and the wait staff was spectacularly attentive.  They even gave me some fried crisps w/ dip while I waited for my food.  My ice water came promptly.  I have a gluten sensitivity and they have a naan substitute for that, which the waitress recommended.  So nice to hear, since usually wait staff are indifferent to your dietary needs.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, which came with rice and my g-free naan.  The masala sauce and chicken was refreshingly good - not too filling, not too spicy (i ordered medium spice) and had an herbal aftertaste that was really nice. And the chicken was all white meat cooked to perfection (I hate dark, chewy meat, which Indian restaurants sometimes use in their tikka dishes - ew.)  The g-free naan was a bit salty and the consistency was more of a fried cracker, but I appreciate them having it on hand and recommending it for me. Dipped in the masala sauce, it was still okay.  Chicken Tikka Masala with GF substitute lunch came out to $14, and I took half home for dinner tonight.  Overall, I can't commend the wait staff enough.  They were fabulous, friendly, attentive (but not overbearing). The atmosphere of the restaurant is clean, modern, and upscale yet casual enough for lunch.  There isn't an overpowering \"Indian food\" smell when you first walk in.  I'd definitely recommend it for a date spot too.  I'll be back, Curry Leaf! :)",

For appetizers we ordered the Gobi Manchurian; which was breaded and fried cauliflower with Indian spices and sauce. They had me at this dish. It was so savory and flavorful, with some good heat to it but just enough that you could enjoy it without sweating all the spices out.   For entrees we got the Korma and Rogan Josh (lamb). The only complaint was that we were too full to order more! Again, so flavorful and savory. We mopped everything up with our paneer stuffed naan. Soooo good!!  We topped everything off with the Gulab Jamin for dessert. Hard to explain but it was like cake soaked in sweet milk, breaded, fried and then served with ice cream garnished with cardamom and honey. Orgasmic.   Can't say enough good things about this place!! Our server was MJ and she was awesome. She took the time to answer all of our questions and was so attentive throughout. The decor and atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the music adds a nice touch to the ambience. Definitely give this place a try!!!",

    "text": "So I love Indian food just not in Las Vegas. The flavors of so many dishes taste too similar here. Not once have I thought wow this is so True to Indian food. So after seeing a five star reviewed location I have to admit I had high hopes. We got there first on a Saturday and ordered two very different Indian Curry dishes. It took a while to get the food which didn't bother me. I don't mind waiting for good food. The food came out looking unappetizing  but I still had hope. Good food isn't always pretty. A tiny thing of rice and no bread. I mentioned it and the waiter said it would be right out. A table sat behind us and after they ordered their bread came out. So I'm stunned watching my food get cold because there's no bread to eat it. A few minutes pass and I get up from my seat to inquire about my bread. He looks at me and says oh it must have gone to the wrong table. There are ONLY two tables. To just be clear I got a very bland\"oh sorry\" and then they avoided our table after. Finally get to try this curry and I'm finally relaxing. Guess what they taste exactly the same. Not sure what happened in the kitchen but the slight variation in flavor doesn't constitute a different dish. So an angry non naan filled lunch later I can say there is nothing special about this place. It explains all the single reviewers five star reviews. You can buy ratings but you can't buy flavor here. As always happy hunting",

I usually get the Korma and although I gave this a 5 star, the only down side is that they are not consistent with spice. Even our server (which we have come to know by name from going so often) told us that it depends on who is cooking that day. I usually order a 3 and sometimes I get no heat, other days I cannot even tolerate it. It's a minor thing really but I would imagine this is more of an issue if you are getting something really spicy.   Naan is great and I often ordered the samosas. The atmosphere is colorful and hardly ever crowded which is surprising. I have converted most of my office to this place as well.",

I ordered vegetarian items and all was fresh and well spiced (I asked for spicy and they made it spicy).   I usually get the aloo gobby and paneer saag. Both were excellent.  Service: I remember very clearly how I ordered take out and dessert that I ordered took FOREVER to be prepared although I told them that I am in a rush and they said it will only be a few minutes. It's fine if it takes long, but the waitress was incredibly rude to me. I eventually just asked for the whole order to be cancelled and walked out. I believe the owner at the time noticed this and sent someone to run the food to my car as I was walking out. The waitress probably doesn't even work there anymore, but I must mention it.",

The meat inside was pretty flavorless and served over a bed of under-cooked onions. The second entree was quite a bit better; the vegetable dish \"Aloo Gobi\". The sauce was flavorful, seasoned correctly and a good meal for the price point.   Would I go here again? Maybe, but not for awhile. Cooking meat correctly is pretty basic and in a place like Las Vegas with so many restaurant options, it's an absolute must to get my repeat business.",

    "text": "I'm honestly surprised to read many of the positive reviews here, but standards for Indian food in Vegas are very low, and many of the people writing these reviews have never had truly good Indian cuisine before. This leads to many reviews of Indian restaurants that lack perspective.  Curry Leaf is at best a mediocre Indian restaurant. My wife and I dined there for dinner recently. We can start with the fact that there were zero Indian customers in the restaurant (a very bad sign). Their \"tandoori\" dishes came out on a sizzling hot plate (fajita style), suggesting that they don't even have a tandoor. After all, if you had a tandoor, why would you not cook the meat on skewers in the tandoor instead of cooking it on a sizzling hot plate?  Even if you disregard everything I've outlined up to this point, we can just focus on the fact that the food is not very good. The chicken tikka masala was below average. The gobi Manchurian was also below average. The aforementioned \"tandoori\" mixed grill was terrible, with the lamb being by far the worst of it. The rice pudding was among the worst I've had. Only the garlic naan was even average here.  If you're Indian, don't waste your time! If you're a person who believes that every Indian restaurant in Vegas is great, you may be fine with Curry Leaf Flavors. Just know that you're not eating good Indian food there.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews, I was very eager to try Curry Leaf. Compared to most Indian restaurants in town, the decor was very bright and cheery. I was really feeling the ambiance!   My friends and I arrived for lunch. Most lunch entrees average $10 and include rice and naan - total bargain! My friends felt that the lunch menu was a bit limited, so they ordered from the dinner menu.   Here's what we tried: Gobi Manchurian   A Lentil Soup   A+ Saag   C Lamb Biryani   C Vegetable Biryani   N/A Roti    A Garlic Naan    A+  The dishes that were good...were really good. The others were approaching the mark. One issue that we encountered was our server forgot to order the vegetable biryani, which happens from time to time. The problem was that he did not own up to his mistake. Instead, he told my friend that he felt she did not need the vegetable biryani. It was too much food. When did servers become the portion control police?   Needless to say, I won't be returning here anytime soon.",

It smells like curry and incense. Lots of bright colors and the room is slightly dim so it's not overpowering.",

Ranged between $10-$12 they have a gold selection from chicken tikka masala, lamb, paneer, saag (spinach). Each lunch special is served with choice of plain/butter/garlic naan and a side of basmati rice. Our favorites are panner tikka masala, lamb rogan josh and chicken tikka masala. They have a happy hour in the afternoon followed by a big selection of ala carte menu for dinner. Highly recommend their dum biryani (rice dish) and malai kofta. They have a full bar and some cool cocktails with Indian twist.",

Manish the manager might just make the most superb drinks and offer the most irreplaceable service possible.... And he's got a great sense of humor.  navi our server was incredibly attentive and the group of them together perfectly compliment. They even brought us an off the menu dessert for my sisters birthday that was incredible (see picture!) I'm in love with this place from every stand point. Will be a regular.  Try the lentil soup, the garlic shrimp and the chicken tikka masala.",

    "text": "Very excited to have this amazing Indian restaurant close to where I live, work, and play. The restaurant is simply beautiful, the food is top notch, and the service was excellent.  We started with the garlic Naan bread and Baingan Bharta, which is Tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. It comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. The flavors were extraordinary.  This was followed by two curry entree's, each served with long grain white rice. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo at a medium spice level. The Tikka Masala has marinated chicken chunks with an onion-tomato tandoor sauce. The Vindaloo has a distinctive onion, garlic, red chili & vinegar sauce flavor. They were both mouth-watering!  - but, literally, the Vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the Tikka Masala due to the red chili's. Of course, the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.  I can't wait to try more items on the menu.   The only downside: The restaurant has a \"suggested\" gratuity on the check that is between 15-20% of the grand total including tax. Gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20%.",

So far I've tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Tandoori Chicken, the Murgh Makani, and Lamb Vindaloo. All were excellent from the meat down to the flavorful sauces that I soaked up with their naan bread. Speaking of which, their butter and garlic naan breads were fresh, warm, and delicious. We tried their Rice Pudding and Gulab Jamun w/ vanilla ice cream and they were both great ways to conclude our meal.   Service was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. They immediately remembered us after our first visit, which is always nice. The restaurant is clean and the decor of the dining area is appealing.   I'm so glad that Curry Leaf opened up nearby where I live as I've always wanted a good Indian restaurant close by. My brother is new to Indian cuisine so I took him here one time for lunch when he was in town. He raved about it so much that he even left a review here on Yelp long before I did.  My review is actually only for 4 1/2 Stars (I rounded up) because I really wish that they had a AYCE lunch buffet special. If they ever did, that would give it a solid 5* in my book easily.",

They let you order spice level 1-10 and we did 8 and found it slightly spicier than we would like but nothing too bad. We ordered five items ranging from dal to biryani and everything was spot on. Overall experience was great and will definitely visit the place when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Overall this was a disappointing experience - everything fell a little flat. There are better indian places in Vegas.   Decor: Fantastic. I really liked the layout and ambiance. The furniture was modern and the decorators did a nice job of making this look like an indian bistro. Great photos on the walls and the wine rack over the bar on the wall was nice.   Service: Meh... Attentiveness was fine, she didn't communicate well any answers to questions we asked.   Cocktails: This is where the majority of points were lost. First of all, don't have any of the cocktails. The server lost points for not being able to describe in greater detail a drink I got that had a masala seasoning to it with tequila. I asked if it was served up or on the rocks and she said on the rocks. Out came what could be described as salty, room temperature, tequila masala broth (with no tequila taste) with two floating frozen cat testicles for ice cubes. Not sure what they were supposed to be, but this drink was absolutely horrid. Usually, I lower my gaze and bite the bullet on something I order, but this one was a for sure send back. My alternate drink was a Jameson and Ginger ale -- they had no ginger ale. *le sigh* My dining partner got a mojito with curry leaf -- rum, curry leaf, and soda -- no flavor whatsoever. The waitress was cool with taking my drink off the menu, but we pushed through the mojito and just stuck to nothing unique for the rest of the meal.  FOOD: Average. Plating was nice, portions were good, everything was just a little less good than I've had in several other Indian venues in Vegas. Appetizer was a three skewered chicken dish - great for two people. A little inconsistent on the cook of the meat, but nothing raw. Lamb Saag and Chicken Tikka Masala were the entrees with Jeera Aloo and Garlic Naan. Everything was edible but just flat; not good enough to return.   We came based on the reviews and won't return instead choosing one of three other places that do everything except decor better.",

    "text": "Sweet Mother of Karma Sutra, how I love thee.... Curry Leaf has earned my love & devotion. I grew up in Nor Cal, in a small farming town, Yuba City with the largest concentration of Sikh's in the U.S. I tell you this because as a white girl, I've been eating Indian food since I was very young. I've been to Indian weddings, countless restaurants, home cooked meals etc... I know my Indian & let me tell you, this amazing little restaurant is a True gem. I'm not going to tell you what we ordered because I don't think it matters- everything is beyond anything I've ever tasted. Mount Everest had been the best in town (still pretty weak), this place is better than ANYWHERE I've ever had!!! My friend & I went for lunch & while we were there, there were 5 other tables of people dinning solo. What that tells me is that these people have been there before & couldn't get Curry Leaf out of their head. It's like crack. I'm going back today & then this time I'm getting their pick-up menu. If you've never had Indian & come here first, I feel bad for you, it'll be like Brad Pitt being your first boyfriend, all the following will pail in comparison. However, if you have had Indian before, this will feel like finding your soul mate for the first time. So go forth & fall in love, it'll feel so good!",

We arrived early (at about 5:15 pm) and there were about four tables already seated. We had the Meen Moilee (Sea bass), chicken tikka masala (medium spice) and Stuffed Naan (which is REALLY good, so we ordered another). As we were leaving , the chef inquired about our dining experience and we told him it was excellent and that we'd be back. If you like Indian food, you'll love the Curry Leaf!",

I was amazed at how nicely decorated the inside was!  A nice small bar, and the manager (Navjot) greeted me in his great Indian accent. I explained I was there on a class assignment and would he help me select a totally vegan meal. He helped me pick out and appetizer, main dish, side dish and vegan bread.   Then the chef Ritesh Patel (Also the Owner) came out and answered the many questions I needed for my class assignment regarding main ingredient, herbs, spices.  He even explained Garamma salsa to me! Both shared about the food and eating customs in various regions in India...  Then the food came out and it was amazing!  Chef  Ritesh said 'any plate on the menu he can made vegan upon request all 'all' the food is prepared fresh\".    I have my school assignment to thank for this wonderful food and meeting these wonderful people, but on my own I will be back and recommend this to my friends...vegan and non-vegan!    Ps. Chef Ritesh said, call me if you have any questions or need help when you are preparing your school project!  Such a beautiful atmosphere, clean, professional, with a family attitude!   Thank you Retesh & Navjot for helping me with my class project!!!  EXCELLENT and authentically Indian!!!",

It's enough for both of us to share with an order of naan. We tried the garlic shrimp the last time as our appetizer and wow-wee!! It was GOOD! The only thing is we'll do mild next time. We get everything medium-spice here but the garlic shrimp was too hot on the medium scale for us.   This place is just beyond perfect",

Dishes we have tried are the lentil soup, the trio of samosas, my favorite - saag paneer (spinach with cheese cubes), chicken tikka masala, lamb shank, mango and rose lassi and their gulab jamin.   The staff are all relatively nice, the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and the food comes relatively quickly.  I go early around 5:30 for dinners in case it fills up because this place has caught on.",

Their manager has great customer service. Everyone makes sure that they check on you regularly.   The place has a homelike yet sophisticated atmosphere. Their menu has a wide variety of options were one can adjust the level of spiciness between mild, medium and hot. Most of the options come with a bowl of rice. The lamb nihari is one of my faves. The meat is so tender and flavorful. The lamb tikka masala is a curry with onion tomato sauce. We also had choco naan for dessert which is a naan with chocolate and coconut stuffing with vanilla ice cream on top. Will definitely come back.   YELP 100 CHALLENGE: #12",

Shame, it WAS a great eatery...below is my original 5 star review.  Mumbai is famous for its seafood so the fish curry here has to be amazing, and it is. Try a Mumbai Mule to wash it down too.  In South Asian cuisine the simple things are the determining factors to successful restaurants and you can tell by the amount of south asians that frequent the place that the food is second to none.   Samosas are amazing, naan is good, lunch specials are great. I love the decor and atmosphere. I've been for casual dining and held business dinners here and no one has left disappointed.  What makes it contemporary, I suppose, is the small plates. I have a Pakistani friend that doesn't like tapas because he isn't full unless he has a curry, so we were able to keep everyone happy here.   Love the place.",

First of a, let me say that this is INDIAN FOOD.  Not American-spiced food of questionably Indian origin.  When you order mild, it will burn the hair out of your nostrils.  When you order medium, you will breathe fire.  No one at my table was brave enough to order full spice.  With that being said, the flavors are luxuriant to the point of feeling pampered.  Their seasonal vegetable korma - I confess, korma is my go-to dish - is creamy, full-flavored and robust.  A pleasant surprise was the paneer contained within!  It had the texture of a really tender chicken breast, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mistake!  No mistake, though - just perfectly cooked meat substitutes, the quality of which could make the culinary gods shed a proud tear.  And their unusual cocktails are awesome, too!  I tried the guava margarita, and I would have gladly put them away until my family had to drag me from A to B if it weren't for my budget.  Sigh - next time.",

During lunch they offer a small lunch menu so if you want tandoori or anything crazy you need to come for dinner.  For lunch: Samosa Trio The trio means that there are stuffed with different delights. All 3 of them were delicious!!   Lamb Rogan Josh Chicken Tikka Masala  Both curry dishes were very thick, rich and chocked full of meat unlike the lunch AYCE places and at the same price. Be warned that they are a little heavy on the spice so you may want to order a little lower than normal. We got medium and man it made me break a sweat while I was eating. The garlic naan was phenomenal!!! I know it sounds silly to rave over a starch but man it was truly one of the best naan that I've had in Vegas. They were perfection topped with garlic!!  Quality food man...  The only dim spots on our visit was the mango lassi which was almost milkshake consistency and was very sour. Aside from the lassi, your experience was top notch.   We still need to make it for dinner to try the tandoori and other dishes but I can still say:  Eat with confidence   -P",

I imagine they are more busy during the week and for dinner.   The place was intimate with deep rich colors that matched the robustness of the flavors in their food. Service was very friendly. We ordered a trio of samosas to start and were suggested to try one of their top dishes, Korma, and we also ordered Butter chicken along with Garlic Naan. It was super tasty and fresh. To end our meal we were treated with a refreshing mango smoothie with fruit dessert which was a nice surprise. I can't wait to come back!!",

We came in at about 2pm and the place was completely empty, which I thought was....unusual. Well it was 45 minutes before they close before dinner service so hey, I'm not leaving so there's that.  For an appetizer we went with the vegetarian samosa trio. They were absolutely phenomenal. One was filled with peas, one with potatoes and the third had paneer cheese and corn. I probably could have had three orders of that and been perfectly happy. I'm a huge fan of Chicken Tikka Masala so it was an easy choice for me. Again, I was absolutely not disappointed. Large tasty chunks of chicken in a rich sauce. The basmati rice was perfectly cooked. The garlic naan was perfect. Little bit of crunch on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside and a whole lot of addictive. Definitely getting a double order next time. Service was fast and friendly.   Not going to lie, I'll be going to Vegas more often in the coming years and I've definitely found an incredible spot for Indian food. I definitely can't wait to try more of the menu and get outside of my Tikka Masala comfort zone. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Date Night good eats! We found this gem researching Indian cuisine on Yelp and with a 4.5 star rating after 416 reviews we had to see if it lived up to the Yelpers' Hype!  Once you enter it is liked you are transported from the west side of Las Vegas to Mumbai. Lots of interesting decor and a full bar once you enter the restaurant. As I noticed on the wall from the Las Vegas Review Journal \"Curry Leaf's colorful atmosphere shows attention to detail...\" I truly concur.  We were quickly seated by a window and if the weather permitted, they have patio seating available. We looked over the drink menu and decided on the Mojito Mumtaj 4/5, dangerous as it tastes mostly like fruit juice and The Himalayan 5/5, very strong and served in a goblet. we started with some garlic naan bread and dipped in the sauces. For entree's we shared the madras paneer with veggies 4/5, would get more spicy than medium next time and the vindaloo chicken spicy 5/5, nice flavor and even better to clean up the last bit of sauce with another garlic naan bread ;-)  For dessert they had a Yelp check in offer for a free rice pudding dessert! Served nice and warm, you can't beat F-R-E-E! Overall a great date night meal and under $60 without gratuity. We will definitely be back to try other menu items. ~NAMASTE~",

The house wine is $8/glass. I got a 3oz pour..!!!! I had to stop my husband from complaining. To add insult to injury, they charged me $10! Back to the food. The samosas have changed. They had the potato one, but the second was some corn kernels and the third was smashed peas. The worst part was the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was old, dried up tandoori chicken in a thin red sauce. Not the normal creamy sauce and melt in your mouth chicken.  We won't be returning.",

The lamb was so tender, the sauce was a bit spicy for me but still very good. When I asked the server if we could have some yogurt because it was spicy she immediately insisted they remake it with less spice, I assured her that wasn't necessary. She then mention two types of yogurt and asked which one I wanted, I wasn't sure so I asked which was better and she said the vegetable yogurt, and she was right it was so excellent and a great complement to the dish. We also had the yellow lentil soup which was very good also. They always filled our glasses with water and was very attentive, service was excellent! There is a Indian restaurant across the street from my house but I will never go there anymore and take the extra time to drive to Curry leaf!",

I had only had decent Indian food once in town and that was many years ago. I went to the Curry Leaf again more recently and I have to say that it is amazing. The atmosphere is very nice and the employees are pleasant. The food is amazingly delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, it is so flavorful. The Garlic Naan is delicious also. My girlfriend ordered the Lamb Tikka Masala. I don't like lamb but i tried hers and it was surpisingly good considering I'm not a fan of Lamb.  We tried a dessert this time and the waitress Dee suggested an authentic favorite in India, Gulab Jamun with Vanilla Ice Cream. It was so very good. Just the rite amount and not to sweet. I highly recommend The Curry Leaf if you are looking for Authentic, delicious, Indian food.",

    "text": "I have now been to curry leaf about 4 separate times. However, last night the service was so slow and one of my typically favorite dishes was so flavorless, the group I was with had to ask if it had changed owners. Although our servers were very friendly, we had to repeatedly ask for water, and during the first hour and a half our group only managed to get our appetizers (we had a party of 4 and there were maybe three other tables). When we asked why the food was taking so long, we were told the kitchen was understaffed and there were a lot of to-go orders. While I understand a kitchen being understaffed it would have been nice for the server to forewarn us that the food was taking longer than usual and perhaps bring us some naan before our dishes. Also, to-go orders shouldn't take priority over customers sitting at their table in the restaurant! That being said, I have loved it here previously. The chicken 65 and the fried shrimp in soy/garlic appetizers are delicious and different. The tikka masala, and paneer korma, along with the saag (with chicken or paneer) are also each delicious. Don't miss out on the lemon rice, or the bullet stuffed naan, or a side of lentils (normally).  I really hope that the next time the service and the lentils, which for some reason this time came out flavorless and watery, improve. If not, I'll just be getting my food to go.",

Each time, the person that has taken down my order has been short and grumpy.   My experience tonight prompted this review. Tonight, I called to place a to go order and was placed on hold, but I could still hear everything. Right after I was placed on hold, the woman started to take down a huge walk in take out order. After 10 mins, and the order was placed and paid for, nobody came back to the phone to take my order (it's like they set the phone down and walked away). I called back numerous times for the next 30 mins and the line was busy. I finally got through and placed my to go order (an entree, extra rice and plain naan). When I finished, the woman said \"that's all you want?\" How rude. I said yes and she told me, \"well if that's all your ordering it will be 50 mins before it will be ready. I'm busy and just got a big order.\" I told her I know I heard the order while I was on hold for 10 mins. She said \"oh yeah, well I have a full house now and if that's all you're going to order it will be at least 50 mins.\" I hung up after that. I got the impression that if I ordered more food and spent more money it wouldn't be such a hassle. What poor communication and customer service skills.   If you're ordering a lot of food $$$ then you'll probably have a different experience here. I never felt my business was important to them or that they cared if I came back. So, I'm going elsewhere.",

Curry Leaf opened a few years ago & is just down the street from my house, but every time I went by I was on my way somewhere & never had the time. What a terrible waste of eating opportunities!!!! The moment we walked through the door we were welcomed by the most delicious smells, & our eyes were filled with beautiful saris in every floor-to-ceiling window. It was a breath-taking effect.  For starters we ordered the samosa trio appetiser, one each of potato, pea & corn, and the garlic shrimp and they were so darn good!!! I could have eaten a dozen samosa myself they were so tasty, but had to save  room for chicken korma & naan.  The chicken korma was so tender & flavourful, the sauce the perfect accompaniment to the fragrant rice & the naan - we got both butter & garlic varieties. The cucumber raita was one of the very best I've ever had.  I also got a takeaway order of Tandoor chicken & garlic naan, & even though I was still stuffed from lunch, I checked out the chicken later in the evening & OMG!!! Absolutely delicious -- tender, juicy & I cannot wait til dinner tomorrow to have this!!!   I am so thankful that Janice chose Indian as our lunch, & I am thrilled that I finally tried Curry Leaf. Our lovely waiter gave me the names of the food delivery services they use, & even though it makes me sound like a wee piggy, I'm already planning my next meal from Curry Leaf Indian restaurant.   Whether you live in the southwest corner of the valley or not, Curry Leaf is so very worth your time. Beautiful decor, great traditional music at the perfect level, friendly & helpful wait staff, & absolutely delicious food!!!!!",

One thing to be aware of is that if you order a dish with paneer that could also be ordered with veggies (like korma), they'll give you only paneer and no veggies.",

The guava margarita was made with fresh juices, no generic bar mix here. The onion Bhaji are crispy curry coated fritters that come with two delicious dipping sauces. They were a bit spicy but that is what you would expect. The Korma Curry bowl is a delicious, spicy and creamy delight. This restaurant has some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Definitely recommended!",

They were hot, delicious and filled with a variety of flavors. One was filled with seasoned potatoes, one with corn, and the third one was filled with green stuff.... I don't remember what it waa, but I do remember it just melted in my mouth. I got the chicken korma which is a coconut based curry. It was creany, slightly sweet, and full of large chunks of chicken. On the side comes an order of long rice and naan bread. Make sure you get the garlic naan, it's amazing.  It also comes with a pair of chutneys which are lovely on the naan brrad and also on the samosas. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items!",

Even though we arrived there an hour before closing on Labor Day, the flavors were definitely not compromised! We ordered:   Mixed Grill w/spice level 8-which was cooked to perfection and just the perfect amount of spiciness. I recommend ordering a side of Naan and a vegetable dish to go along with it. All the meat was very tender and juicy. It also came with a sweet sauce and a cilantro-lime yogurt sauce which were both delightful.  Madras Lamb (spice:8) again cooked to perfection! The lamb was so tender and the sauce was spicy and delicious!!   Baingan Bharta- a beautiful Smokey eggplant dish! So delicious :))  We also got two orders of garlic Naan which were very light, buttery, and toasty, and a free (Yelp check-in) Cardamom rice pudding which reminded me of my mother's rice pudding just with the added cardamom.   The service was good and they were very friendly, however, I would suggest getting there at least an hour and a half or two before closing as they begin cleaning up about an hour before closing. It did seem as if they were a tad rushed and/or stressed at the time we arrived but they were still attentive and very nice! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and they do play Indian music which is a plus for me! I love being able to listen to music related to the cuisine you're enjoying :) The portions are on the smaller side, but is definitely worth the price for the quality and flavors. Overall we spent about $60 with tip. I only wish they had a buffet! I will definitely be back soon!",

It also felt like fine dining but at more casual prices as the environment was very clean, and silverware and plates were fancy.   I got both gluten free options for the naan which were both amazing, with my entree being the chicken tikka masala. As I said before the food was amazing and I don't have any complaints.   I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars because the service was a little slow. We had to wait for water a few times and we were the only diners there at the moment.   Regardless, the food was 5/5. I enjoyed it so much I plan on taking my parents here when they visit next.",

Exterior may look small but interiors wouldn't disappoint. What about food? No doubt this place would exceed your expectations. Food is so heavenly that i placed a take out for evening snack. I was searching for a good lunch spots and bang on this place was it. Starter: Cauliflower Manchurian  Taste buds are blessed with the aroma and flvours of indian spices in this indo-chinese fusion snack. 5/5  Main Course: Parda Biryani (Biryani pot covered with baked flat bread) Holy moly this is the best biryani i had tasted after  an year in united states. Every spoon you taste drools you into the heavenly flavors of the authentic indian spices. Raita was extremely soft and perfect combination with the rice. 5/5 Dessert: Rice kheer (rice pudding) How come a person go wrong at making dessert when the chef is excellent at main course and starters. Absolutely not, dessert was perfect finish for the day.  5/5 How is the service? Excellent, no other words 5/5 All the above mentioned items were perfect for two people with average built  Best aspects include the food presentation too.  Overall 5/5 and thumbs up",

Everything is a la carte but they do have lunch specials, which is exactly why we went today!  We went in at around 130 PM and they seated us right away. There were maybe 2-3 other tables aside from us so they weren't very busy so the service was quick!  They have several options for their lunch specials and I decided to go for their chicken tikka masala. It comes with rice and naan (regular, garlic, or butter), which I chose garlic. For spice level, you're able to choose 1 to 10 and I decided to go for a 10. The server did pause, gave me a look, but wrote it down anyways.   The food is pretty tasty! Their chicken tikka masala isn't the best one I've had in Vegas but it's still good! Level 10 spice was a good kick -- it wasn't too spicy at all. If you've had Archi's Thai, their level 10 spice is WAY spicier. I would say that Curry Leaf's spice level 10 is maybe comparable to a spice level 5-6 at Archi's.   They kept our waters filled all the time, which is great!   Overall, great flavors and great place to go if you don't want a buffet!",

I even told that NO SPICE for the Mix tandoori but it was super spicy. I gave them 4 stars because of the food quality ( to be fair ) since I ate it even its too spicy for my taste. I am not sure if I will order here again.",

I got 2 curries- Rogan Josh and a Meen Moilee, one garlic naan and a stuffed naan for $47.   For the price I paid, I expected to get much more quantity of food. The Meen Moilee didn't even fill a third of the bowl it came in and there was Very little sauce below the sea bass which was disappointing since it was my favorite. The Josh Rogan was filled about halfway in the bowl and the actual lamb meat was pretty tough. Compared to some of the other local Indian places, this one is roughly on par with quality but the quantity is definitely lacking.",

Today when we went there around 2:30 pm, it was dead. Only 2 other tables besides us. The food came out quickly and was HOT when it came out (just how i like it) and the service/staff was friendly.   Food i get: the mushroom veggie dish, garlic naan and white rice.   Pros: great food/flavors, of course lots of vegetarian options, service   Cons: the bathroom toilet under construction!

It's quite far from the strip but well worth the time, reached around 8:40 for dinner the restaurant was fairly empty as they close at 9:00. I wasn't sure how the food would be since the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes but the food turned out great. Interiors are nicely done modern and minimal.  ~ Butter Roti $3 ~ Garlic prawns $10 ~ Chili chicken $8 ~ Aloo jeera $6 ~ Chicken biriyani $14 ~ Rice pudding (free with yelp)  Every dish was full of flavor but my personal favorite was the garlic prawns and least favorite was the biriyani but hey I'm not complaining. The portions are great and service was fast. Prices are reasonable.  Definitely coming back to check out other items on the menu.  Cheers!",

We were craving Indian food in Vegas when we came across this place and decided to stop by without any plans and it was such a good decision. The chicken was juicy and spicy af (just the way I like it) and I ordered everything 10/10 on the spice scale. This was a little too spicy for me in the way that I wish the spice was cooked into more instead of it being just added in towards the end (yes, I can taste the difference). They got plus points from me for having *real* tandoori chicken and not just chicken with red dye and amazing service. I also ordered a guava margarita but I would ask for extra guava nectar next time. If you're in Vegas, solid Indian restaurant for sure.",

Vegetable Samosas ($6) - perfectly fried golden pockets of goodness Lamb Tikka Massala ($16) - good mix of spicy and savory, with chunks of lamb that blend seamlessly with the sauce Murgh Makhani ($16) -  Perfectly cooked and the spices were just right.   Rogan Josh ($16) - So much flavor. And it had a good subtle heat. Malai Kofta ($13) - The perfect combination of sweet and spicy  Garlic Naan ($3) - Perfectly chewy and soft in the middle.. a great side add-on for either of the choices above!  Everything was delicious. The service was quick and the staff friendly.  We will be back.",

I've heard from numerous people and fellow foodies, including Yelp God Philip T., that Curry Leaf is the best for Indian in Vegas, but I've never mustered up the desire to go until recently. Gdamn, I've been missing out!  My wife and I started off with the garlic shrimp, and it had this wonderful combination of sweet, sour, and salty! It had a bit of a Chinese influence to it. I loved it, and I'm gonna order two next time! The chicken tikka masala was good, very creamy and flavorful. My only knock was that the chicken itself was a little stale.  The highlight dish was definitely the lamb Rogan Josh. The dish was super aromatic, and the lamb was melt-in-yo-mouth tender! I would get it a tad bit spicier, but overall, I was very impressed with this dish!  Our server recommended the Kadai so we tried it with chicken. It was very tomato-y, but it had a good amount of flavor, and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  I would skip on the mixed Tandoori grill. It was served on a sizzling skillet (dope presentation), but the meats and shrimp were really dry and lacked flavor.  We also tried the Meen Moilee which is pan seared sea bass in a coconut ginger sauce. It was the thinnest piece of sea bass I've ever seen, but the sauce was really good and sweet! We had to get the garlic naan, and it was very addicting, super buttery and fluffy! We ordered another round.   The food is about 4 stars, but the attentive service is what made me bump them up to 4.5.  Overall, you can't go wrong here at Curry Leaf if you're looking for some solid Indian food.",

    "text": "I love Indian food, especially when it does not involve a buffet!! My husband and I recently enjoyed an amazing meal at Curry Leaf!! Our server Milica was very passionate about the cuisine here, and helped us decide what to order. Started off the right way- a bottle of Justin Cab. Following that came the Onion Bhaji appetizer, very tasty and surprisingly light. Korma came next with chicken, it was seriously complex in flavor and we ate so slowly to savor every little bite. Had the Mushroom Poriyal side dish which complimented the dish very nicely. Also enjoyed a salmon curry dish which was so delicious! No room for dessert this trip. Before we left, Milica introduced us to the owner and head chef, Ritesh! He was so nice and down to earth, had a very nice chat with him! If you love good Indian food- this is the place to dine! Very nice decor and ambience, and it's quiet. You can hear your friends talk!!",

Everything we've tried is excellent. Trust your server on spice level. Different chefs on different nights makes a big difference. No frills but fab !",

    "text": "this is my 3rd time there now, I've got some mixed feeling about this place but overall it's good.  The pro: 1. food is delicious!!! from Nan to entree, they are all so good, their lamb is super tender as well as the chicken, I don't think I will ever go back to another indian buffet restaurant now because when your food is made to order, it just simply taste better that way. 2. Interior is very pretty, clean and inviting! waiter and waitress are all very polite and nice!  The Con: 1. service is ok....a bit slow sometimes especially when it's busy, if they are not busy, the service is slightly faster 2. Watch out on the tip suggestion on their receipt, you should NEVER tip on the 8.1% tax, ONLY tip on the original food price, but the tip suggestion they give you also include the percentage on the tax part, I do not like that at all, and hope they will fix this soon. 3. If you go, I strongly suggest you go during lunch time, it's much cheaper and you get nan for free, they told me dinner portion is bigger, but it comes in the same bowl they serve me during lunch, and you will have to pay extra for Nan as well....maybe they did give me a little more, but it's not anything significant to where I can tell...(honestly I can't tell at all that dinner is bigger....)",

It was a soothing quiet tone atmosphere with soft music playing overhead. There was one waiter working four tables so my boyfriend and I were not timing him on how fast he helped us. We were indecisive for a long time anyways. Lol. We were given water immediately which tasted like faucet water so we ordered Ginger Ale instead. We ordered garlic naan with onions as the app, Lamb Tikka Masala, and Lamb Saag that all came with butter naan and rice. The wait was reasonable and plates were brought out right before the food. This is the BEST Indian food I have ever had. And Im a Serious Foodie. My boyfriend and I were breathless and couldn't talk about anything else but the food and the spices. Our ginger ale stayed more than half full and we were checked on while dining. There's so much more we want to try so we will definitely be back. There was enough food to save for lunch the next day too. I very much recommend this place.",

The restaurant is tucked back into the corner of the center, so you have to go hunting for it, but once you find it, it is well worth the search.   My portions were a little small, I'm a big guy and like to eat a lot, especially good Indian food. I did go during lunch and so my portion was most likely a smaller, lunch, portion. I plan on going again during dinner to eat again, and hope I'll get more of this delicious food.",

I did have an instance where my server (blonde haired lady) was behind the bar chatting with other servers, looked at me and laughed rudely. I could not hear what was said but it did make me uncomfortable. Another server I believe Indian herself, was on top of her game making sure we had our drinks, plates were taken and had an actual conversation with us to make us feel welcome. I will of course go back because it was so tasty and the ambiance was amazing. I just hope they make everyone feel welcomed.",

The food, oh my goodness, the food! It was very delicious & flavorful. We had the samosas as an appetizer, the pastry was light & crispy, the filling was very delicious. The dipping sauces were also wonderful, it came with a mint sauce & I don't know the name of the other sauce, it was sweet but yummy. We then had the tikka masala, saag & rogan josh. Zero complaints about any of it. Also got some naan bread & peshwari naan, very delicious as well. If you are craving Indian food & your near the Tropicana & Fort Apache area do yourself a favor and stop in for dinner. You won't regret it!",

The service and the environment were perfect and pleasant, the food itself had almost no flavor at all, tasted like the the stuff you get from the store. It all looked great but disappointingly the chicken korma and vindaloo I had tasted like nothing. If you're looking for real AUTHENTIC Indian food go to Mount Everest, it's all family owned and the flavors there are real Indian flavors and pack the spice punch you're expecting.",

Our waitress seemed like she was in a hurry and started walking away before we even finished telling her what we wanted.  That always strikes a nerve in me. You should say, \"was there anything else?\" before you walk away from a table.  The lady that was helping her out was much more kind and welcoming.   We ordered:  Chicken Tikka Masala Lamb Rogan Josh Saag Shrimp  Overall, it was okay. It was good, but for some reason, some of the curry seemed powdery? It's a weird texture/consistency to me. But, you know. Whatever. Maybe I don't know anything.   I've been to so many places around town for Indian food. And a couple of places, I've found this odd texture.   So, I doubt we'll be back. I was somewhat disappointed due to the high reviews.",

So we quickly ordered 1. Dhal Makahini, 2. Paneer Saag, 3. Veg biryani 4. Egg plant & two Idls for the kids.  Food came out super quick, and boy it was off the mark totally - not one dish seemed to made fresh - all reheat and serve. Indian food especially when reheated changes flavours - all dishes here were below par, nowhere close to any level of classic Indian food as so many Yelpers have rated this spot -  Most of us left of food and did not bother to take out . Poor experience on all levels DO not go here late, maybe their service and food is better during the early hours.  Keen to know",

There are only 4 scraps of meat and all watery soup. Called and spoke to the manager Elmer and informed him of the quality of food. I asked for a replacement or a change of order because I wasn't expecting a soupy dish and the portion wasn't satisfying.   I asked for a dinner portion instead and an order of naan bread and I'll will pay for the difference. The Manager told me not to worry about it and to come pick it up in 10 mins.   Apparently, the manager has inability to listen to customer's need as two lunch specials were made instead of the order of dinner portion. I came back in once again and told him this is not what I asked for over the phone. He said the chef just want to make the same exact thing I ordered in the beginning. Since when does the chef decision overrule the customers' want ?  Seriously? How cheap can you be? I have told them that I will pay for the difference if needed but saving that nickle and dime is more important to them than customers' want.   I told him that I don't the lunch special and I would like to have a dinner portion instead. He grabbed my lunch portion and said he will put it in one container. Really ???   Wow. This manager needs to be fired. He does not listen, has poor attitude and bad customer service. I told him that I don't feel comfortable with him taking the food away from my view and doing stuff at the back which I can't see. His attitude continue to worsen.  At this point in time, it's useless to even try to talk to him. I walked out and told the lady server that it's a shame to have him ruin the establishment. I have been coming here for a while and they rather lose a regular customer and save that nickle and dime than to make things right.   Ritesh, if you are the actual owner and reading this, my advice to you is that don't lose your customer over nickel and dime. You need to fire Elmer and retrain your staff to listen to customers' want. Do not say one thing and do another.",

The flavors were very good and authentic. The portion sizes were reasonable and great for sharing.  The decor of the restaurant was modern, but at the same time had a good Indian touch. I was also very satisfied with the service. The employees appeared to enjoy their job. Overall, a great restaurant to come back if you are craving some indian food.",

I also ordered one of their house cocktails, the curry mojito. Appetizers came out quick as well as the drinks. The cocktail was a little disappointing. I was expecting the curry flavor to be more present but the flavor of the drink was flat. Definitely enjoyed the trio. Our main entrees came out as soon as we finished our appetizers. I fairly enjoyed my vindaloo while my girlfriend enjoyed her masala. Probably just a preference in food types. Definitely a good place for lunch and portions weren't too big.

First off, try the grilled spicy shrimp appetizer. Amazing. The texture is at least as good as the flavor. It's a bit crispy and the shrimp is done to perfection. Also got samosas. Three different fillings to try and all good.  For the main course, went with a staple of chicken tikka masala and the lamb rogan josh. I liked the chicken tikka more but the rogan josh had more spice. Paired those up with nan bread and a vegetable raita. Take my advice here, get the raita with whatever you order! It's a yogurt dish that pairs with everything.  OK, now it's off to home and an amazing food coma!",

We ordered the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and the lamb biryani at a medium level spice for both meat dishes. Each dish was equally delicious, well prepared and generous in portions. We are small eaters and have enough leftovers for two more meals for the two of us. We'd definitely encourage Las Vegas natives and visitors alike to try this place out and soon!  They just opened three weeks ago and we personally think they should be very successful. We will definitely be back to try the saag and the rogan josh.",

I had the tandoori salmon which was just melt in my mouth A-MAZING! Chicken 65 was probably the best chicken I've ever had. Their ice cream and rice pudding were spectacular, as was their Nan. Everything was just full of flavor! The waiter was a little soft spoken for me to hear all the time, but I'm not saying it was a bad thing. They were absolutely Wonderful. Family friendly, they had a high chair immediately when we walked in. I can't say enough amazing things about this place. Highly recommended!",

After trying again last week it was obvious that whatever change has transpired over this last year, it was not a good one. The food was bland and tasteless. Will never return, do not recommend.",

The menu was not even opened yet, and she made no attempt to make any recommendations so we just ordered water, I did not see their cocktail menu on the table had my favorite mojitos until afterwards but I already lost the mood to order a drink with my dinner.  Once again, no recommendations on appetizers or entrees. Server just walks up and said \"ready to order some appetizers?\" I had to ask for recommendations and suggestions.  Also, we tried to take advantage of the Yelp offer for free naan by checking in but was told it was only available by ordering the chef's special. It felt like deceptive advertising. All this before my food was even served. The host was polite and the food runner that just brought my food was very nice. Lets hope the food makes up for the service. Update after dinner: Food was wonderful! Milica was the name of the server listed on the check, she never introduced herself.",

We had 3 apps 4 entrees and 1 dessert. I normally don't prefer Indian food. This place has changed my perspective. I will and want to return So as to support such great business in my hood.

Also the music is low if it is not busy so it is good place to chatting and dating, once it gets crowded they raise up the volume of music which obviously is an Indian  music .

It had a perfect crust on the outside and the spices (we ordered it mild) were just right.   My wife had Papad (she can't have gluten) and I had the garlic Naan bread and both were good and the sauces they came with were delicious. For the mains, my wife had the Lamb Nihari and I had the Murgh Makhani (chicken thighs). The sauces that they came in.....out of this world!! (I could have licked both plates clean!)  We would order these again without hesitation, but next time we go (and it will be soon), we would try their other dishes.   The staff was friendly and the prices were not out of line.  Easily 5 stars.    We cannot wait to come back!!",

Wait staff and service was helpful and friendly, nice clean restaurant but the food does not have us dying to return. Chicken Tikka Masala is my go to dish so if you can't do this well...hell I can even whip a tasty version at home. We shared it so we ordered it at medium heat. It was very tomatoey tasting, not enough spice, very underwhelming. Chicken was pretty dry as well. The Cheese Naan we got was really good, it helped flavor the dish. We also got The Samosa appetizer, the traditional potato filled one was good but tasted like the frozen ones I've purchased from the grocery store, the other 2 flavors I just didn't like and Doug wasn't willing to try them if I didn't like them. I'll probably go back and give it another try since its so close to home but I won't be dreaming of it.",

I always used to pass by this place on my way to grab a quick lunch at work but boy was I glad we came for dinner. The food is exceptional! I would definitely recommend for those wanting to try something different. We had the garlic shrimp, lamb visaloo, chicken tandoori, and of course garlic naan. I haven't had Indian food since 2012 and I don't know why I stopped eating it. I'm just so happy to have found this place because food is my happiness and this food made me ecstatic.",

The long unsatisfied craving for Indian food would now be extinguished under waves of masala chai - and their masala chai here is delicious! Served by awesome hosts in the finest silver from India (the manager told me). The decor and ambience of this place is inviting and relaxing. Not too bright and not too dark. We were greeted by the friendliest host. We couldn't decide what to order because we hadn't had Indian food in so long. We finally decided on the Samosa appetizer, garlic naan, Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag, and Tandoori Chicken. All were prepared fresh and in reasonable time. Presentation was amazing, but I didn't care because I knew was going to demolish these dishes. Every dish was more amazing than the next. The chicken Tikka masala was rich and flavorful! The vegetarian Saag was perfect. The tandoori chicken hit the spot - grilled, marinated and lots of meat. The garlic naan was amazing! Light, flaky, and delicious. I would have ordered more, but a certain Monty Python scene came to mind. I knew another wafer would make me explode. The dining experience was perfect. The place was pretty busy for a Monday night. We definitely found a great restaurant. The bill total was reasonable but definitely reflected our appetites. Like shopping when your hungry! We cannot wait to return!",

I was craving Tandoori Chicken, and opted for the Tandoor Chicken Tikka. It came out on a sizzling plate, accompanied by three of the most delicious sauces I have ever had. The spicy sauce was perfect, the lime yogurt sauce was tart and balanced, and the tamarind sauce was the best I've ever had. I can't wait to keep coming back here and discovering all the incredible hidden gems this menu has to offer. The service was another major plus! The staff was very friendly and attentive. One of my prior Indian food spots had service which made the delicious food not even worth going to the restaurant to get. Curry Leaf's service is on point, as if the delicious food weren't enough to keep me coming back for more.",

I have enjoyed the lentil soup, which is flavored with curry. I make my own at home, but this style is so delicious and still worthy of ordering.I love the naan bread and have also ordered the lentil chips, which are gluten free.  I do not understand some of the recent reviews, as I think this is one of the classiest Indian restaurants I have been to. Yes, we go to buffets in town, but when we want a relaxing, special lunch, we will go here and ordered from the lunch specials.",

This was my first time ordering from here, and I ordered what I typically get: butter chicken, and saag with lamb (where I can get it). I also got a side order of butter and garlic naan and because I checked in through Yelp, I got a free rice pudding.  I was at first a little disappointed because my lamb saag came in a pretty small container, but then I realized I had ordered a small, and that was user error! The saag was the smoothest, creamiest, most flavorful and delicious (sauce?) that I had ever had. Literally. I've never had a more delicious serving of lamb saag than this and I've eaten Indian cuisine all over this country! The meat was well seasoned and prepared within the creamy sauce, and all in all, it was just a bit of heaven. The butter chicken was just as smooth and creamy, buttery, and just a tiny bit sweet, and pretty perfect. Both naan's were equally delicious, but I think I'll probably go for the butter naan going forward. I haven't tried the rice pudding because I'm simply too full at this point, but I'm certain that I'll be back, and this place has earned a spot in my all time favorite restaurant category. I'm hoping this wasn't just a first timers good luck, because I want to come back to this place time and time again!",

    "text": "Pretty sure this is \"Indian\" food not done by Indian people. It took a while for someone to seat me, because no one was working the front area despite there being next to no people in the restaurant. The music they played was loud, vulgar club music, though they switched to Indian music for a little while when a father and his young son came in. Then they switched back when they left.  The food was mediocre. The paneer tikka was about 50% overpriced (I initially misread the menu and thought it was $10 when I ordered, which would've been a more reasonable price point); four pieces of tikka with some out-of-place veggies accompanying it (broccoli, carrots, cherry tomatoes). The flavor of the sauce was too sweet, not complex or sophisticated, and underspiced, though the latter is a general trend in Indian restaurants not overwhelmingly patronized by people who really know the food.  They focus a lot on their alcohol, and it feels like a place for Americans to come and have a few drinks and eat something somewhat resembling real Indian food, like a non-chain \"Indian\" version of P.F. Chang. No thanks.  I reserve 1 star for the insultingly bad--stuff that makes me sick, or service that offends me, etc. This doesn't sink to that level. But I was deeply, deeply disappointed and given that there are other, better Indian options fairly close by, I can't imagine ever returning to this one.  EDIT: the same person who has responded to other negative reviews messaged me that I \"should've known that paneer is flavorless\", a rather odd response given that my critique was of the sauce, not the paneer itself. The paneer was fine. The sauce was not. It wasn't a matter of it being flavorless, it was a matter of it being too sweet, and not complex. It's no wonder their operations are not good, they don't even understand customer feedback.",

Now, you may be thinking, \"butter chicken is fairly standard in Indian cuisine, can't really mess that up.\" I'd beg to differ.   Additionally, I recall the portions were a filling size and the very very good value for the cost. The lunch special afforded me and a friend the same dish and desert for under $30.

Cauliflower - Words cannot describe. This dish is amazing.  Chili Chicken - Mix between Chinese/Indian. So good!!  Chicken 65 - Unique flavor. Very good!!  Garlic Shrimp - Very good!!  Appetizer off the lunch menu - Had Chickpeas in it. This thing is awesome. Ask for it if at dinner.  Chicken Tikka Masala - So good. My favorite masala anywhere. Great flavor of sauce.  Lamb Korma - bomb!!   Lamb Rogen Josh - So good!  Chicken Tikka - Huge pieces of meat  Garlic Naan - Fire!  Chicken Biryani - Sooo good! Comes served with doughy naan.  This place has the best flavor by far. The only drawback is on the curries - you don't get much meat.",

    "text": "It's really odd Feng Shui when you walk in - a long empty granite countertop strewn with beaded trinkets and no sign of a hostess, and a longish hallway reminiscent of a nouveau spa entrance from the 1990s. There doesn't appear to be a restaurant here. Welcome to Curry Leaf Flavors of India!  I might get flamed for this (do people even say that anymore?) but I feel pretty strongly about this: unless you're utterly desperate to have Indian food for dinner, avoid having dinner at an a la carte Indian restaurant. It's just a terrible value compared to the ubiquitous (and inexpensive) Indian lunch buffets available all over the world.  Curry Leaf is no exception. It's all a la carte, and the good stuff on the menu is $13-$15 a portion. The portion size is disappointingly small-to-medium. There are $7-$9 \"side dishes\" of things like baingan bharta (good but annoyingly small portion) and dal, and after you add in the naan ($4+) and biryani ($13) you're looking at least $30/person and you might still be hungry when you're done. There is no way that the parties of 8 that I saw dining got enough to eat. Ask for extra white rice and you will be dinged $3-$5 depending on how much more you want. That's pretty telltale.  The Paneer Tikka Masala ($15) was served lukewarm and it was a stingy portion, as was the side dish of baingan bharta ($7). A 22oz. Taj beer was $9. Again, *all the money* for a strip-mall Indian joint that would be impossible to find if it weren't' for Yelp.  Aside from the general bad value, dinner was pretty tasty, but it all came out *way* too fast to be entirely made-to-order. My guess is the curries are all pre-made the day before and added to the proteins you order. I'd bet a lunch buffet on it.  2 hours later, my stomach is growling from hunger. Not even kidding.",

I don't really know Indian food too well so, the BF did all the ordering. Based on Yelp photos, I did know that I wanted the fried cauliflower appetizer.  Also ordered the samosas, cheese naan, mixed tandoori plate, and lemon rice.   Can I just tell you that the cauliflower app was the most amazing thing we ordered tonight! Hello, it's fried cauliflower covered in some sauce that reminds me of BBQ sauce but WAY BETTER! I've come to really love cauliflower apps lately, it's like the new broccoli.   Samosas were super bomb. Flakey but, thick. If that makes sense. I loved that it wasn't meat samosas, all veggies. Corn, garbanzo beans, and some green thing/veggie.   Mixed tandoori came with chicken, shrimp, beef. Lots of protein on grilled onions and peppers. Didn't care for the chicken too much cuz it tasted dry. Nothing a little mint chutney sauce can't fix tho!   Lemon rice was good and they gave a lot. Didn't realize it was that much in one order.   Cheese naan is best describe like a fluffy quesadilla! Super bomb! I wanna try the cheese with garlic next time. Cheese garlic naan = mind blown!!!!   All in all great meal. Nice service! And all close to home. Can't wait to come back for more cauliflower.   Next time I wanna try the garlic shrimp!",

    "text": "So, I'm writing this review at 3:24 am on the toilet feeling absolutely disgusted by this horrific meal we ate here.  Ok, back story, I live in N. Las Vegas, Aliante area, my gf used to think this was her favorite restaurant in the world and she wanted to take me. We travel all the way there (it's a 35min drive). My meal comes out a good 4-5min before my gf. This puts us both awkward situation and I try to share. Because she is treating me I don't want to seem rude and I completely force down my meal, I'm not complaining, I'm just thinking to myself: \"next time she wants to come here avoid and ask her to make it a girls night.\" Truly, if just myself didn't like the meal I would've never spent this time to warn you, but... it wasn't just me!!!  My Gf as she was eating her meal looked horrible; I asked what's wrong and she said: \"eat this chicken?\" I tried to, I really did, but what I was chewing was like horrible old frozen hard meat with the freezer burns and everything not even dethawed and forced cooked to where it was so rubbery it almost made me sick I had to spit it out in the napkin.   The only good thing(s) I can say about our meal was our server was AWESOME, kind and hard working (I tipped him $9 on a $32 tab because I felt so bad he worked at such a horrible food location) and the ambiance was beautiful. But as far as the food...   I study under a Swami from India who cooks amazing food when he's in the states. I legit, love, immensely Indian food. This my dear friends reading is not Indian food.   Every place has its bad nights; this place was definitely sharing theirs as a fellow diner family next to us was so disgusted by their meal they were complaining as well.  All in all, unless you want to be on the porcelain toilet at now 3:35am hating your life's decision to go here; please avoid this catastrophe at all costs.  Yes, my gf was also so disgusted by her meal she did say: \"never, ever, again will I go here.\" Glad I don't have to voice my disgust to her and after this review and the hours it'll take to pass sitting on the toilet, afterwards, I'll forget this place and only will be reminded while scrolling through my reviews. (I tend to block tragically bad memories intentionally, this meal, Curry Leaf was a tragically bad memory)",

We've tried many of the curry dishes and a few of the appetizers. Korma is my husband's favorite and now that I've tried the malai kofta, I never order anything else. The gobi manchurian appetizer is beautiful, from the lightness to the flavors. The samosas are good. The naan is airy and warm, just wonderfully made.  You can tell that the chef is an artist and takes pride in the food. Four stars because food is slightly overpriced for the amount you're served.",

    "text": "This is a review on take-out. We had Tandoori Mix Grill, Lamb Rogan Josh, Aloo Gobi, Tadka Dal, naan (garlic and plain) and Gulab Jamun.   The Mixed Grill was less than stellar. The reshmi chicken was dry and quite bland. The tandoori chicken was well cooked but the rub remained pasty and almost chalky. Like they cooked the chicken first then threw on the rub. The jumbo shrimp were delicious. The star of this entree was the lamb kabob. SO GOOD! So moist and juicy.   A craving for Rojan Josh was what made me want to try Curry Leaf. And the dish did not disappoint. The sauce was exactly like I remember having as a young kid. The lamb seemed a but overdone but the sauce made up for it.   Tadka Dal and Aloo Gobi were both out of this freakin world. I ordered this dal thinking it would be mild so the kids could eat it. It was on the spicy side which is how I like it. The kids, not so much. But that's their loss. The cauliflower and potatoes soaked up the spices yet the cauliflower remained crunchy and the potatoes tender. This was probably my favorite dish.  Naans were both soggy which could have been because this was takeout and condensation settled in the foil which held the naan so it's not entirely fair to hold this one against them. The garlic naan was very garlicky and very yummy. BUT the plain naan, one corner was entirely raw. It made up about a quarter of the serving size so this was a real disappointment.   Finally, the Gulab Jamun, I'd suggest making each ball larger so you get more of the soft, syrup soaked yummy center. And maybe up the honey/rose water in the syrup. It was so-so. Be warned though, with a takeout Gulab Jamun order, you don't get the ice-cream. Boo.  So there were some hits, some misses with Curry Leaf. Would I go back? Yes. But I'd steer clear of the Tandoori Mixed Grill and probably explore the vegetarian dishes more as that's where I got most flavor and authenticity.",

One of my own personal pet peeves about eating out is when spicy food is too spicy- even after I implore the server to please make as mild as possible. Never fear... They have a 1-10 scale, and I had to have a 1 ( not because I want to, but because I have to) ... And I was still worried- but not to worry, ha, it was almost too mild for me (which is near impossible).  But the flavors were absolutely SPOT ON, the textures, and colors and the entire presentation - just brilliant and beautiful!  And this was merely lunch!  The decor is so tranquil and cooling ( greens, with spice colors for accents and flowing silks in gorgeous, cascading hues ) and the open space is not cold, but lets you breathe. It was hot today, but it was perfect here on so many levels.    I cannot wait to go for dinner...",

After being seated, it took almost 15 minutes for our server, an incredibly curt, rude guy who said his name was Jackson, to bring us water and take our order. After that, he literally never stopped by again. After 30 minutes, my boyfriend politely flagged him down and he refilled our water and we asked how much longer the food might be. He responded \"I really don't know\" and started walking off, so we asked if he could give us an estimate. He looked irritated and said \"I don't know-5 or 10 minutes?\" at which point he disappeared again for 15 minutes. We kept looking around in disbelief as almost no one else in the restaurant had food and people had been waiting even longer than we had. Eventually we were able to flag him down again, and asked for a serious estimate as 10 minutes had come and gone and we had plans later tonight, & he sighed again & said \"I don't know-5 or 10 minutes?\" EXACTLY as he had before. I understand that restaurants have bad days where they get too busy or a server calls out, but there is NO excuse for a server 100% neglecting people and being actively rude to customers like that. Anywhere else, the server would check in on you, come by and refill your water, maybe offer some complimentary bread, give you a real time estimate, etc. But I witnessed Jackson blow off and be rude to a number of other patrons and he was such an epic jackass to us, I was just stunned. We eventually left after waiting for 50 minutes and never getting our food.",

    "text": "We finally have a great Indian restaurant on our side of town.  Took my parents and brother from out of town there for a belated Father's Day dinner.  My parents' previous experience with Indian food was sparse and bad.  My father said he thought Indian food was gross and my mom said she got the runs the only time she ate it.  But, my reputation for picking good places to eat is deservedly awesome so they went with it.  I ordered lamb saag and chicken tikki masala with garlic and butter naan on the side.  Samosas for appetizer.  Pretty standard but I wanted to go with popular dishes and maximize the likelihood they'd enjoy it.  I shouldn't have worried...the food was really excellent.  Flavorful and beautiful.  The samosas were nice and crispy on the outside and no toughness to the pastry at all.  It just shattered in your mouth like it should.  Fillings and sauces were delicious.  The saag and tikki masala were excellent.  Excellent with rice, excellent with the naans, and excellent eaten all by themselves.  I ordered them mild because of the parents but I think a little heat would have made them even better.  I'll do that next time.  Our dessert was absolutely fantastic as well.  We normally don't get dessert since Chinese usually just eat fruit or weird sweet soups but I ordered us the milk cake with vanilla ice cream to share.  Fantastic buttery note on the cakes finish and the ice cream was fantastic.  Nice contrast of hot cake and cold ice cream.  It really was the best dessert I've had in a long time and at $5 it was a steal.  If you ordered that on the strip it's $12 easily.  Hope everyone checks this place out.  The chef told me they've been busy but when I went it was near empty.  We NEED this place to thrive.  It's exactly the kind of neighborhood restaurant that deserves to be a huge success.  Decor was beautiful and the service was excellent.  Waitress and bartender were beautiful and that never hurts either.  ;)  Highly recommended.",

Reasonably priced wine & cocktails, their signature Mai tai was very good & when I requested an extra shot of rum, as I like a strong drink , it appeared instantly & at no charge!  We had the Samosa, Tikka Masala, Korma, garlic naan & the Tandori roasted eggplant mash. We will definitely be back!",

And food was not at all spicy. They prepared food fast . But I my self a good cook so this food was not for me. Good for ppl who like non spicy Indian food.",

Realistically though, as long as the food is great, you can overcome bad service.  The service wasn't really bad, it was just really slow.  For apps we had the Lamb Seekh Kebab, Samosa Teen Tarike Se & Garlic Shrimp.  All really good but Garlic Shrimp was on a level all on its own.  For entrees, we had the Tandoori Salmon, Lamb Vindaloo & Chicken Tikka Masala.  Again, all really excellent!  Asked for mild to accommodate the child in the party and my wife that likes it a little less spicy than myself.  All arrived with good portions and mild.  Still tons of flavor and dipping the Garlic Naan in the sauce is always a must.  We also had the side Kuchumber Salad.  Again, excellent.  We were so stuffed we had to pass on dessert and had some leftovers to enjoy for lunch.  We will definitely be back.  It's now on the rotation for pickup on the way home after a long day.  I recommend it highly!!!",

I haven't had Indian cuisine in quite some time due to the lack of good restaurant offerings -now don't get me wrong there are plenty of Indian food restaurants in Las Vegas however I find most are too oily or include ingredients that leave you with terrible lingering heartburn.  Curry Leaf Flavors of India offers just that, delicious clean flavors you can savor. My first experience included the samosa appetizer. A samosa trio with two dipping sauces. The green sauce gave the samosa a creamy mint compliment while the other sauce added a sweet and slight tang flavor -both delicious and I found myself double dipping!  For lunch, we shared the Chicken Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan. The flavors were superb with just the perfect amount of spicy kick and flavor -you can request your comfort in spice level. I am eager for my next visit and to explore more of their menu, if today was a taste of what this restaurant offers then I have just found my new favorite Indian cuisine location.",
