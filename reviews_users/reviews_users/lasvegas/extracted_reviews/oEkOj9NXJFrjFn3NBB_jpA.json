    "text": "Rhythm Kitchen exceeded all of my expectations. I made a reservation for 2 on Open Table (great app for reservations), we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time and we were seated immediately. Our server came over and introduced himself (the music was loud, so I didn't catch his name) and brought us water. We asked for a moment to look at both the libation & food menu. Once water came and drinks were ordered , we concentrated on food. The menu is absolutely Southern with a Louisiana flair. They have alligator & frogs legs. I chose charbroiled oysters as an appetizer and the hubby get the baby back ribs. OMG!! The ribs literally fell off the bone and the oysters were like nothing I have ever had. For my main course I got surf n turf, lobster & a petite filet. Both were cooked to perfection. Hubby got the jambalaya. Also amazing. Save room for desert!!! Our server made mine tableside!! Strawberries Madagascar!! Trust me. Order it. You won't be disappointed. We will absolutely be back here again! Yes it's spendy. Worth every penny and you'll have food to take home. Win win.",

The server Jolie had always checked on us to ensure we satisfied every single course.  The server assistants offered great team work with her to provide excellent table service. The Tomahawk and Lobster was a bomb ! Enjoy this place , thanks Jolie !",

When we got there, they tried to put us in a booth which is really not comfortable for six people especially since I'm a larger guy.   They were accommodating and sat us in the lounge until they could get a table ready.    Had the Rib Eye steak blackened, YUM!  Had their version of oysters Rockefeller and they were great.    More upscale than I thought it was but well worth the money. Try it out!",

I reserved a table for 6 over the phone, and with the addition of 3 more guests I called the restaurant to change my reservations to 9 people. I also received an email to confirm reservations for 9. Upon arrival there was no table for 9 people, but a table for 6. They scrambled to try to fix it, and after a 15 minutes wait they seated us at a table set for 8. I told them that was not going to work as I had an additional guest on their way. They proceeded to add a table that was shorter in height to our table. My son, and his girlfriend was good sports to sit at the kiddie table. They were almost in the kitchen with doors constantly opening. I never had a manager apologize to us for the failure to accommodate my party of 9 in a comfortable fashion. I will never return after 3 Thanksgiving Day dinners at this restaurant. A very nice African American woman was the only one who offered an apology. Oh yes my check in drink for BOGO was not honored too. I suggest take your larger parties elsewhere as it was complete chaos on a major holiday.",

    "text": "Came here for my best friends birthday dinner. Place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be on a Friday night. So I guss reservations weren't necessary.  Eric was our waiter. He was super nice and funny. We asked about the check in special and free dinner entree birthday coupon... he had to go ask about it but in the end we were able to use them  After all our drinks came... they brought us the bread and hush puppy basket. bread was soft, fluffy and warm. Hush puppies were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. They had a little kick to them which I liked. I wish they were a little bigger though. The one small suggestion I will make is trading the unsalted butter for salted. The roll was good but the unsalted butter just made it pasty... a little salt would have brought out the slight sweetness of the bread.  We ordered the calamari, $12, as an appetizer. It was pretty tasty. Perfectly seasoned and not overcooked. I wish the sauce was a little thicker though. It had good flavor but it ran all over the plate when poured.  Dinner entrees can be served with soup or salad in full or half. We all ordered half a caesar, $4. Croutons were yummy...not break your teeth hard but crispy. One of my friends didnt care for the dressing... l thought it was.good...My friends ordered the pasta special $27... I believe it was shrimp and half of a lobster tail over linguine in a tomato, white wine, shallot and garlic sauce or something like that. Came with a breadstick which one of my friends was a little burnt on th bottom. They said the pasta was pretty spicy but they enjoyed it. I ordered the 14 oz ribeye with red beans and rice and it came with brussell sprouts, $26. steak was a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly. Nice grill char on the outside. It was tender and juicy. Red beans and rice were perfectly seasoned with a slight kick of spiciness and not watery or over cooked. Sauteed brusell sprouts were tasty, slightly buttery and sweet and not over seasoned.   We were too full to order dessert but the selection looked good. They did bring out a sundae for my friends birthday.  Over all.. we had a pretty nice dinner. Some minor adjustments and this would have been a five star night. Service was great. The staff was super nice and friendly. Food was really tasty. I would definitely come back again. They have happy hour every day and every weeknight they is some kind of special. The prices are reasonable compared to the portion size you get.",

Crescent City Pasta, 19  for $15.05 (Used the $25 Groupon valued at $50)  - Nicely situated off the 215/decatur exit. Amazingly large building  - Can't use Yelp Check-in for free drinks. \"Only one coupon at a time, now.\" HAHA. Taiga Modern Groupon hooked it up THO!  - You can use Groupon for AYCE! \"Camera watching, can't share.\" haha, meaning both have to get the AYCE Crab, $32. Figured that's a similar price as a Bellagio/Bacchannal so we passed.  - Free bread basket. 2 Dinner rolls/6 Hush puppies. Hot but stale. Butter tasted like whipped cream.  - Appetizer: Spinach and artichokes topped with BBQ crawfish and mozzarella cheese. I enjoyed the crawfish with the dip, but compared to Red Lobster it didn't have the same rich consistency as theirs. Some chips were stale others were crispy. Somewhat of a hit/miss.  - Jambalaya: Andouille sausage sauteed with onion and peppers in a spicy canjun sauce. Topped with rice and served with shrimp. 8 shrimp. Too dry and not spicy. For tasty Cajun Jambalaya go to Costa del Sol. That packs a True punch in flavor.  - Crescent city pasta: Linguini tossed with crawfish, shrimp, scallops, mushrooms and spinach in a Cajun lemon herb garlic butter. 4 Shrimp. Excellent taste! Loved the amount of crawfish. High recommendation!   - 18% gratuity added if Groupon used.  -  Lighting too dim for my taste. haha. Dim red... - Fast service! We were in and out in about 30min! Impressive! No time wasted. Waiter packed our own food.   - I think this place would be great for group meetings or big events, but for great tasting Cajun style, I'd opt for Costa del Sol for the same price.",

Sometimes I get a really soft tender one and sometimes its a bit tuff. It must depend on the location in the smoker and how long it has been smoked. So, send it back if it is tough and they will fix without question.  The beignets are yummy.  I order these first as otherwise I won't have room.  The wait staff is friendly and responsive.   This is a really nice fancy place.  They have been fine that we show up in shorts and t-shirts, but it may make you feel uncomfortable to be in such a nice place dressed that way.  They have a nice bar and a party space upstairs.  Groups are easily accommodated and I've been here for a birthday party too.  No problems serving the group.  This is also a great place to impress a date.  Dress nice and look classy to impress.",

James was our waiter and let me tell you...by far the best waiter I have had in this town. He was as attentive and took care of everything. There was a change to the crab cakes that has thrown me off. They are more like crab balls now instead however the flavor is still there. But then my creole came out and it was liquidated a tad more than normal but still good flavor. James noticed that I only had a few bites and asked me if the dish was good or not. I said it was good but it is not what it normally is, he then said he would send over the manager Alfonzo, I told him that wasn't necessary go ahead and box it up I would still take it with me. James then proceeded to comp my desserts and Alfonzo came over and told me he comped my meal and my appetizer of the crab-cakes. This is just a shining example of why this is my favorite restaurant they like feedback! They listen and take care of their customers especially the regulars! If you're ever in town and are looking for a place to go, please go see them, do not let my review discourage you! this is still one of the most amazing restaurants in town and the food is full of flavorand totally brag worthy!  And ask for James you won't regret it!",

We tried a variety of things - My 2 favorites were the Alligator and the Frog Legs; Both were delicious and they really do taste like chicken. We also tried their shrimp, oysters, scallops and catfish all prepared in different ways... so awesome! And for desert, the restaurant manager Chris came out & prepared for us the Strawberry Madagascar. Its a Strawberry Flambe and it was to die for! All in all our dining experience there was phenomenal right along with the food & we can't wait to go back!",

The Sazerac was watered down but the charbroiled oyster appetizer was good. The Caeser salad was to be expected and a good portion for a half salad. Next up was the Atchaya half catfish-half crawfish etouffee which was delicious and flavorful which left me bitter about eating the worst jambalaya of my life. It tasted like they dumped the box out and didn't mix the spices since I managed to get them all in one big powdered bite. I ordered it with chicken and shrimp but it came without shrimp and the worst andouille sausage ever, seriously it tasted like a ballpark hot dog with spices. Tried to finish it off on a high note with banana fosters but they used little to no (betting it was none) Myers rum to caramelize the bananas which were obviously green as they had absolutely no sweetness to it. Service was fine, no issues other than slightly slow.",

The place is very large and attractive, but virtually empty at noon this Sunday.  We were given the choice of the bar. dining room or upstairs and we initially chose upstairs, because there were more people up there which would possibly make it more fun.  But upstairs they had a HUGE TV screen with a football game on and a few noisy men drinking beer and cheering on their team.  Decided the dining room was more conducive to a nice Sunday brunch.  After looking at the fairly extensive menu of mostly cajun and creole selections, I chose French Toast with Bananas Foster, and my husband got shrimp creole.  I also opted for the $18 all you can drink mimosas, and definitely got my moneys worth there!  A side of potatoes came with my french toast (?) and while I didn't want them, my husband saId he would have them hash browned.  The food came on my third mimosa, and was very well presented.  My french toast was just delicious, altho way more than I could eat.  My husband said his shrimp creole was very good too.  Not spicy hot, but well seasoned.  I tried a bite of the hash browns and they were great.  Very crispy and seasoned perfectly.  After my fifth mimosa, I asked them to please cut me off.  That might sound like a lot, but even now a couple of hours later, I have only the slightest of buzzes, so not a lot of champagne was wasted on them.  But they were still very good!  A few more people came in as we were eating, and a bridal shower party of about 10 young women came in as well.  I was very surprised that there were so few people there with as good as the food was, at least what we tried.   Our bill before discount was $55 plus the fixed gratuity of 18%, and we ended up paying $39.55 after the coupon was deducted.  I would say that we will try the place again, probably with another coupon.  It is on the other side of the world from where we live so not convenient to visit regularly.  But we definitely enjoyed it!",

We were seated after a short wait, as their dining room is small. Our server, Robert, was attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful on giving suggestions on drinks, entrees, and apps. My honey ordered an Abita hefe style beer that Robert recommended and liked it. We ordered a cup of gumbo for an app that my honey would not recommend. We shared the salmon and rack of  ribs and both were delicious. The ribs fell off the bone. The ambiance was lovely and i highly enjoyed the piano player. He even encouraged me to sing along to my favorite tunes that I requested. Key lime pie was for dessert and it was ok. Next time, we will probably try the brownie sundae, as my honey was torn between the two. Looking forward to the next time we make it to RK.",

I made reservations a month from the event and when we got there, we have to wait 20 minutes because they have to set up a table when it's supposed to be ready right away. Anyway, I requested a table closest to the balcony but they sat us as far as possible from the balcony and facing the freaking wall! It took another 20 minutes before the waiter came to us. Their menu that day is pre made already. My boyfriend doesn't eat seafood so I had a concern because some food that was included were seafood like the crab cakes and lobster so I called the day before to ask if we can exchange the seafood into something like chicken. The host said it's ok. When we got thee the waiter said, the menu is already set up for that day and can't be changed. So I got upset because I was told something else. My bf was upset and wanted to leave! So finally he's willing to change the seafood menu . The food was great but will never come back ever again. 95% of the crowd are old people too!!!! View from the balcony is pretty though.",

There was ample food for the price, however I wasn't impressed with the sauce. I felt it was too tomato pastey and kind of bland. It needed more flavor and spice for my taste.   We love Creole/Cajun food and we are always on the prowl for a dining experience in Las Vegas that will satisfy. Unfortunately this was not the place.

I heard a few personal reviews at work, and they were all good, so, I decided to give them a try.  Went in on a Friday night just in time to beat the rush.  There were many open tables when we arrived, but the place was packed when we left.  We tried the crawfish and alligator tail appetizer, which was very good, and they provided complimentary bread and hush puppies.  The hush puppies had a little bite (possibly jalapeno), but were good.  My hubbie had the n'awlins seafood delight, which was catfish that was smothered in what seemed like a spin on an alfredo sauce, they call it alfredeaux with green onions, tomatoes, and veggies on the side.  I do not like catfish, but it was very good.  I had the crescent city pasta, which was linguini with scallops, crawfish and shrimp, in a tasty lemon herb butter sauce.  It was very good as well.  I am not a wine drinker, but I tried the bayou belle, and believe me they do not skimp on the alcohol.  I had one drink, and by the middle of my meal, I was wondering how I was going to walk out of the restaurant amongst the crowd..lol.  My boys had the cat fish and the shrimp children's meals, and they enjoyed their food as well.  The ambiance is nice-soft jazz music, candle light, and even when crowded, it wasn't overly noisy.  My only complaint, the tables are too small.  With the candle light, sauces, plates, salt and pepper shakers, drinks, etc.  we needed a bigger table.  Overall though, a great find.",

A random waiter told us the lounge was open since 4p, but the kids couldn't go into the lounge due to licensing. He explained that the dining room didn't open until 5p. He leaves, doesn't take our name or anything. A party of 4 walks in as the male host walks up. He greets them & takes their name, also explains to them that the lounge opens at 4p, but the dining room opens at 5p. A lady in the party says that she saw online that they opened at 4p. I stand up & tell the host that when you search on Google, it does say that the restaurant opens at 5p. He looks at me & says, \"That's Google that's not us.\" The lady leaves her name & leaves. The host says nothing to us, doesn't ask if we've been waiting, if we'd like to place our name, nothing.  He's on the phone taking reservations for awhile, then a female host shows up & he instructs her on where to put the dinner napkins that are laying on the host counter. 10 min later, they both return, he explains that the party of 4 is their first seating & that we (the party of 6) are the next party & are waiting in the lobby. WRONG, we were there first! But since no one else was there, we didn't make a big deal of it. The hostess seats us at 4:45p & then our dinner service was pretty ok. Appetizers came out quickly & were good. We really liked the friend calamari & slightly, spicy hush puppies. My hubby said the salmon was ok, same with the seafood pasta dish that I had. My kids both liked their kid's meals, but it was nothing spectacular. Everyone really liked the iced & sweet tea, but the winner was the strawberry lemonade. The biggest let-down was the beignets & it was the reason we found this place. My daughter had been craving beignets, since we ate the Mickey Mouse beignets at Disneyland. I searched beignets in Las Vegas & this place came up. Unfortunately, they tasted EXACTLY like toaster strudels, just without the filling. Beignets shouldn't have filling, but they definitely shouldn't taste like that, especially not when you are paying & 9 for 3 of them!  They made the ones at Disney seem like a delicacy. The service overall was pretty good, the entrees took a while to come out, probably because the appetizers came so quickly. They did get really busy, though. Our waiter was nice, but not super friendly. As we walked out, I had to say goodbye to the host.",

I was so tired of getting ripped off on the strip that I decided to pay this place a visit and it was fantastic. You walk in and you feel like you're in a southern city. I really like the location because it's in a quiet location away from all the noise but you can still look and see all the Vegas lights.   We were immediately seated and greeted warmly by the hostess. Our server was very warm and accommodating. As an extra treat we got a coupon for buy one drink and get the other free.  We started with a salad and crab cakes for appetizers. The salad was good but I still have dreams about those crab cakes. DELICIOUS. Perfect seasoning and was cooked to perfection. My main dish was a seafood pasta that was pretty good.   Overall I had a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back as soon as I get back to Vegas.   Thanks Rhythm Kitchen for the good time!",

See Tuesday night's are crab night all you can eat.  Now I am allergic  to shellfish so when we go I order the rib eye (Yes I am also very picky on what I will eat) so it worked out perfectly for us. Now they changed it to a sea food buffet upstairs from the main dinning room, They are charging 39.95 per person, I asked them what they had on the buffet to see if there was ANYTHING I would eat. Well there isn't! I asked if I could order off the main menu and pay for what I ordered ( I wasn't going near that buffet) to which I was told, \" you would have to pay the 39.95 to sit up there and the additional money for any thing I ordered off the menu\"! The other option was to sit downstairs but the crab legs wouldn't be all you can eat,!  So we would get screwed either way!  How can an establishment expect people to do that??? I guess they don't care what customers they lose! Remember I have a seafood allergy could you imagine what cross condemnation you could get on that buffet??? Well we will never go back there nor will I ever recommend it to anyone ever again!  Beware they don't care about their customers if they could do that!",

We did discuss with staff who advised that do to them trying to get more crab out sooner they did not soak the crap to remove salt. We also overheard other patrons complaining about it as well. We spoke with Jesse as well as Lewis who attempted to write the wrong. They even tasted it and agreed that it was quite salty.  I have  been coming here for years and Jesse has Always provided quality aervice...but we're told by the manager Chris who felt that he needed to push crab out faster for the demand of the patrons as opposed to giving quality he was more concerned with quantity.  I must say I was not happy at all with the outcome. We received apologies for the quality of food... However, we will most likely never come again as much as I like the servers and bartenders... To top it off on our way out the  female at the register was \"packing\" her cigarettes... Very unprofessional. As we we were leaving we were verbally assaulted be a patron that Chris was attempting to eject from the restaurant .

Since when is gratuity included for a party of 3? Actually when the bill came we were charged for 2 of our kids who are 1 and 4 years old. They barely ate and the server said under 5 is free. Why charge for kids who are clearly below the age limit or not even ask to be sure. So the Included gratuity is higher? For 3 people? For a buffet? No where does it state in the fine print for this gratuity included on your website. Just would have liked to have been aware. Is this a usual practice here? We dine here regularly and have never been automatically charged for 3. The meal offerings certainly did not surpass my anticipations. Catfish was all breaded, a couple of pieces had actual fish. Turkey sitting out, reminded me of employee dining room food. For a dining establishment that has been our go to for many years, let us down. Our Thanksgiving holiday meal.",

My family traveled all the way from North Las Vegas to this restaurant only to be very disappointed with the service that was provided. They asked me to fill out a comment card, but I opted to wait or else it would have been a very nasty one.  Our night started out well. We were seated within minutes on entering. But our issue started when it took about more than 15 minutes to get our sweet tea drinks. Not only did we have to wait till AFTER we received our appetizer to get our drinks, it still took 3 different requests to get it & they delivered it to the table behind us! We also didn't get any bread & hush puppies till right before the appetizer was delivered. Everything was CONSTANTLY being delivered to the table behind us. Now keep in mind there were maybe 5 tables & 3 different waiters available.   No deserts were ordered because I was so frustrated I needed to leave. You're better off doing take out than to eat in.

I have ordered the crescent city pasta as an entree while the bf ordered the jambalaya w/ shrimps. The pasta is soooo good especially the scallops!!! The scallops is really one of the best scallops I've had:) and they don't skimp on the seafood either. The jambalaya that the bf ordered is a little too tomatoey/saucey for me but he likes it. This is a good spot for a romantic dinner / date. Also I had gotten really good service. The nice blonde waitress (I think it's Erica... I forgot) was really personable and kept on top of things.

Mothers Day is suppose to be a special day, thanks to Rhythm Kitchen and it's poor service and lack of planning it turned out to be the worst experience my group of 5 mothers and the rest of us have ever had.  Reservation for 5:45 for which I may add you could only make with a Credit Card, and yet not seated until close till 7:00 pm.  Then had to flag down waiter just to get in a drink order then wait another 15 minutes of so just to have our order taken.. Food was not brought out until about 8:15 or so, and then it was cold at that.  Best of all, is all the G.M. and the waiter did was apologize.  No offer of discount, free desert, nothing.  Not that I was looking for one, but most food establishments in town do this at minimal. They ran out of Lobster, ran out of baked potatoes.......Really on Mothers Day, you didn't see this coming?  All I can say is wow.  Horrible, Horrible experience. I will never again go to this establishment and I will make sure I tell all of what a poor dining experience I had.  Shame on you for overbooking and poor planning, shame on you, Mr. Scott, and it would be wise of you to instruct you staff on how to better handle customer complaints.",

The odd thing was that the gentleman who seated us turned out to be our server and I saw him walk through the dining room multiple times before he even came to take a drink order.  We ordered the shrimp Jambalaya which was OK and an appetizer platter.  The appetizer platter had 2 kinds of baked oysters - very small in size but somewhat tasty, a scallop skewer - also just OK and a shrimp brochette which was shrimp wrapped in bacon. This was the worst part of the dish because although the shrimp was cooked the bacon was basically raw.  I doubt I would return for another try since there was nothing good or great that really stood out during our visit.",

    "text": "So, we went there on a Tues night for their AYCE Crab leg special, we've been there before for this, never had a problem. So, last night, we were greeted by a red haired hostess, who asked us to wait just a moment, which stretched into like five, while she flipped through menus and stacked them while we stood there, then greeted another couple and walked them to the bar and left us standing there....ok, so another blonde hostess walks up, they discuss where to seat us, she walks us to our table, seats us and then promptly gives us a etiquette lesson on how \"Tuesday is their busiest night\" and she \"would highly recommend making reservations next time\" I'm a grown adult, I don't need lessons on reservations. If they don't want walk-in customers on Crab nights, maybe they should state \"reservations only\" somewhere instead of having your hostess chastise your customers.   So we get seated and were promptly greeted w/bread and water and Chris our server, whom we've had before. He was excellent as always, took our order, which included a salad and crab. Out comes the crab and the salad like 10 minutes later....and no bucket for the crab shells. We had to ask Chris for a bucket, we noticed every other table w/crab had a bucket. No biggie except we had crab shells everywhere until Chris got us a bucket after we asked. We did notice that several other customers got the \"reservation lecture\" from the Hostess. Had we not had a Groupon, we would definitely had gone somewhere else, besides the service from Chris, I can't really say there was anything spectacular enough to bring us back, especially not the lecture.   I've worked as a Hostess before, and they are the first point of contact for customers in the restaurant, the two girls working at Rhythm Kitchen last night were neither friendly or welcoming and would seriously be a deterrent to us coming back, especially if coming back w/o a reservation involves a lecture everytime. C'mon, this is Vegas, who makes reservations except for large parties or special occasions?",

This place blew my mind yesterday and here is why....  I arrived at rhythm kitchen with the sole purpose of getting gumbo. It was a craving. Well, when I arrived and was ready to order the waitress (Emily) informed me that they were out of gumbo. Needless to say I was thrown off and a little upset because what kind of Cajun place doesn't have gumbo? So instead of ordering something else, I was just going to stick with the appetizer and grab something to go later. Emily and her manager (I forgot his name) were so great and so phenomenal that they spoke to the kitchen and made me my own personal batch of the best gumbo I've had to date. I'm not sure if the management has changed or improved but all in all, I have yet to have an experience in Vegas quite like the one yesterday. Everyone should go try it! :)",

Run not walk to this beautiful establishment and enjoy some good cajun cooking.

Main reason for one star (the food was acceptable) was the horrendous service.  Poor women customers at the next table received the wrong order, never did get the correct order sent out, and the manager refused to come to their table!  I have never seen a manager refuse to talk to a customer.  Another table appeared to be having issues also.  Finally, the waitress told us my groupon (which I already purchased) was changed to reflect rising menu price increases!!  I couldn't believe it.  Maybe Yelp should institute a zero rating.",

Upon arrival, I asked the server if we would be able to use two Living Social coupons in one sitting and he told us we could so we decided to order up to $80 worth of food.  My dad was interested in a glass of wine and the server offered us a special that was half off the bottle so my dad decided to order that since it was a great deal.  The food was delicious.  We had the spinach and artichoke with crawfish dip and the sampler as our appetizer.  They were sooo good!  Even the butter for the dinner rolls were to die for!!!  And as for our entrees, I wanted the prime rib but they were out so the server suggested the rib eye steak and I am glad I ordered it because it was really yummy.  We were having a great time until the bill came and the server told us we could not combine the coupons with the half off bottle deal so we thought that was okay so we decided to just take the coupons.  Then the server came back again and said he could only take one coupon and not two.  That was when we asked to see the manager because if the server had not told us in the first place that we could use both coupons or even suggested the half off bottle of wine, we would not have ordered all that!  When the manager (his name is Scott) came, he just pointed at the coupon's restrictions at the bottom and we totally understood that (we only asked if we could use both in the first place because even though the restrictions state that we cannot combine coupons in a single transaction, some places were able to take more than one in a transaction) but as a manager, what he did next was completely unprofessional.  He just said \"Okay, let me ask him (the server) if he would be willing to pay for part of your wine\" and then he just disappeared into the kitchen before we could say anything else.  What kind of manager asks his worker to pay for part of the bill even if it was their fault for misleading the customer?  The server came back out and the manager was never to be seen again.  Hm, figures.  The server told us he was willing to pay for part of the wine because he knew it was his fault and he took full responsibility of it but we told him we did not want HIM to pay for anything.  In the end we just paid our bill and still left him a good tip because at least he was nice, sincerely apologetic, and he was a good server.  He just needs to get his information straight.  But because of poor management, we will not be returning to this place again, even if we have a second unused coupon.",

Wide selection of wines available could be seen though the glass to the full bar. I had the blackened catfish and red beans and rice which was good and some fried oysters which were average.

In spite of there being only two other tables occupied, it took our waiter over 15 minutes to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to bring us our drinks.  So we sat at a table in a nearly empty restaurant for nearly 1/2 an hour before we even got a drink.  The bread basket our waiter said he was going to bring right out, didn't materialize until after we received our appetizers and only after we asked for it from another server.  So even though the service sucked, it may have given more stars in my rating of the food had been good, but it wasn't.  The jambalaya was spicy, but the consistency was terrible and the chicken in it tasted as if it had freezer burn.  My friend ordered the day's special of barramundi fish over coconut risotto.  The fish was old and the risotto was a big clumpy mess.  Even worse was my friend got sick after eating it with what were the symptoms of food poisoning.  Bottom line, is if you want good cajun/creole food, DO NOT go to this place",

    "text": "This experience was so bad I made an account just to state it.  My fiance and I went to Rythym Kitchen for a wedding dinner. We arrived around 745 only to wait what felt an eternity to get a basket of undercook dinner rolls and hush puppies. The majority of the party was already in attendance when we arrived. The party was 15+ at one point until hungry guests began to leave. If it had not been for the bride and groom, my fiance and I would have went across the street to eat at Subway. This notion would have led to a much better evening had we seized the opportunity. Instead we stuck it out only to spit up undercooked dinner rolls and wait until after 900 pm to be served our appetizers.   At one point my fiance asked our server why was it taking so long for our food to be served. She responded that she put the orders in as soon as we gave them to her. The thing is no one ever walked around and asked if we were ready to order. Meanwhile all the menus were laying down as everyone knew what they were ordering. This whole time the manager was waking around with his nose up in the air not even thinking to ask how everyone was doing. My fiance called him over and explained the lack of service and the disgust of his hungry patrons. All he had to say was \" I'm sorry you feel that way.\" and some other b.s. about all our party not arriving at the same time. We were the last 2 people to arrive and this is where the waiting began. They could have taken orders from the rest of the group and we would have had plenty of time to decide. This manager was not apologetic whatsoever. He did not say he was sorry for the inconvenience nor that he would see to it the rest of the evening would go smoother. He stayed away from our section after this encounter.  The food finally arrived with some dishes meeting the expectations of the guests and others not so much. The ribs were burnt, the fried oysters were all breading, blackened salmon meant burnt instead of seasoned,  and steaks were overcooked. We had to ask for more rolls, requesting they be fully cooked this time. Drinks were staying empty for 10 minutes. One guest got water poured into her glass of Sprite. I could understand the slow service if the place was having a dinner rush, but aside from our group there might have been three other small parties in attendance.  All party members were disgusted to see a 20% gratuity added to our bills because of the size of our party. Most were asking to have the service be removed for the lack of service. The father of the bride was able to get his burnt ribs removed from his bill after speaking with the manager. This manager never apologized to the group.  Everyone in the group was in consensus that the service was bad, the manager was rude and the food was okay at best. Not one single person in the group would have stayed in the restaurant if it wasn't for the bride and groom. I almost did not pay for the gratuity fee as we left the restaurant, but I walked back in to put the rest of the bill in. On my way back out I expressed my disgust with the manager and told him I was never going to dine at Rythym Kitchen again.   If you do decide to eat at Rythym Kitchen, I hope your experience is much better than ours.  Reading other reviews on here I can see a consensus with large groups having bad experiences, while small groups have good ones. I will not give this place another experience as I do not feel it is worth my time or money. No groupon will have me walking back in this disgraceful restaurant.",

However after the topic of conversation sparked today about our experience last night I thought I would come write a review. The establishment is beautiful and they seem to get the people through the door. However maybe to many people we could tell that out server was way to busy but she handled it well we could see she had a party in the separate dining room along with a full station in the big diningroom. Also my boyfriend said when he went to the restroom he stopped to check out the bar and she was taking an order in the bar. How many places can one person really be?!?! Our food was fantastic we loved the crescent city pasta but our cocktails came after our appetizer. What really made me want to write a review was how well our server handled the table next to us they started out upset about the drinks not coming out fast enough from there on out she couldn't do anything right she explained the bar was backed up to every table but this one took it to heart. Every time she addressed the table after they were short and rude as if they wanted her to bage to take the order and eat there they saw how busy things were and they throw a hiccup on the flow of everything. Goes to show if you feel you aren't getting good service look around and see if it's because your server is in over there heads or just lazy. I have to say none of the servers at rhythm kitchen were lazy all great employees but could use an extra set of hands. I highly recommend this place the food is made with heart and the staff busts there butts.",

Drinks and food all arrived in a timely manner, the food was fresh and hot. LOVED the Alligator bites to start off with. The pastas were all tasty and spicy.  The prices are on the high side, but fortunately we used a Groupon.",

They definitely are going for southern food style and since I've never been to the south, I don't know if it's authentic or not but flavors were good. Lots of fried food... Service was decent. We really loved the live piano music, that was very nice! I would probably come here again..",

The lounge is towards the back and if you go in thru the front the girl at the front isn't very helpful, nice but seemed a little clueless on making sure you were heading in the right direction or not. We ended up dinning at the bar because there was a party with a lot of older people upstairs and my friend and I are in our late 20's. Our bartender was a sweetheart, from Mississippi and she chatted it up with us for a bit, which was nice because she wasn't annoying. We had a couple dirty martinis, which were perfect... bartenders nowadays forget what \"dirty\" means and you always have to ask for it extra, extra dirty to just get a thimble of olive juice... this wasn't too dirty but seriously perfect. We ordered clam chowder, jambalaya, fried pickles, pork sliders and pizza... We thought they'd come out in norm portions (small) and we would have a titch left over... NO! We were totally wrong. Everything was huge! Our waitress said to us, \"We feed ya here!\" No shit! ha ha It all tasted great and we had tons of it. The only thing I wish was different, is that they were out of green tomatoes because they had all ripened. All in all, I'm going back and they better have green tomatoes this time!",

They didn't have any source of heat for the food only a heat light that didn't heat anything. The snow crab was unseasoned and cold. The fish was Room temp. It was way overpriced, the dessert was horrible. They had cookies and whip cream to spray on it. I seen the add on Fox News so I wanted to try it. They said the seafood would be hot but that was a lie. Charged $50 person when really it should of been a 20$buffet. On top of that they ran my credit card at a price of $91 but on my receipt I complained about how horrible the food was so they dropped it down to $81 but when I checked my account next day they charged it for the original price of $91 I had To Call The Lady the Next Day and she Did refund the amount But the hassle I had to go through Rather Go To The WYNN Or Cesar Place and spend the Extra 20$ To Get What We Pay For... Dirty bastards...#STAYAWAYSTAYAWAY#",

Guess Sysco food, shrimp over cooked.  Served hurricanes in plastic cups! Waiter nice guy. This place is a disappointment, probably why they aren't open on regular basis. Spend the extra hit the strip, Emeril would not be happy.  Overall this place sucked.  Go elsewhere.  Other reviews must be relatives. If you can't get it right on Fat Tuesday forget about it.

Lobster was like a rubber, we complained about it but we didnt want another one because the wait was too long and yet it didnt come out of the check, $25 lobster tail, waste of money.

Fried alligator was still good but quantity was like 9 small pieces, didnt understand that,  1st time was like a calamari dish where there was a lot. Ceasar salad...too salty,  and to top it off, baby back ribs was a big portion but was DRY... wanted to try the beignet but this nights experience was poor. But server Louie was good..he did great at the beginning and wish he  asked during dinner if ribs was ok but he was slammed with at least 4 to 6 tables with parties of 3 to 8 seaters ....but I guess I'll just go to chili's for ribs",

There really is two floors.  I only stayed on the first floor.  Not sure what's on the second floor.  I tried my first alligator here.  They come out both grilled and fried.  Tasted like chicken.  It was good.  I would have it again.  Alligator is a must if you're going to go to a cajun/creole restaurant.    The shrimp gumbo was a little too salty.  I like salty, but this was really salty.    The lights are really dim in this place.  Still a good place to take a first date.  I would just tell them to add less salt if you decide to order the gumbo.",

We ordered the clam chowder which was good, but probably won't get again, a dozen oysters which were a 3/5, the steak which is like top 3 best steaks ever, lobster tail (I cried literally as I was eating it, it was like sex in my mouth), and lastly the ribs which I was sad because I don't eat pork.... When I took a bite I felt guilty but it was really good even though I don't support pork.   Our waiter was awesome and very friendly and attentive. He honored my free glass of house wine with a yelp check in and made sure me and hubby were good to go.  The setting is very odd kind of like fine dining which is weird for a southern food place. It is very upscale and glamorous. I absolutely loved it! I will be back :)",

First they stuck us in the corner because we were \"underdressed\" for their establishment.  We just came from my daughter's tourney at Majestic Park AND it was hotter than hades out...what did they expect.  Plus it said CASUAL on yelp, so we came as we were.  I started with the server's recommendation of the Marti Gras Punch.  It was super sweet and undrinkable.  What a waste of $9.  I told the server several times that it was too sweet but she did not take it off our bill or offer me another drink.  IMO that is poor customer service.  She asked me if I like the drink and I told her it was too sweet and I could not drink it, and she did not do anything to remedy the situation.    My food wasn't any better.  The gumbo was so salty I gagged trying to eat it.  I wondered if they did that to balance out to overly sweet cocktail.  I mostly ate the bread bowl and my daughter shared her Lemon Pepper Peel and Eat Shrimp which was not bad.  My son and husband both enjoyed their dishes...but you can't really screw up fried.  Their desserts looked good but after being so disappointed with both my drink and my gumbo, I didn't want to risk it with dessert.  This place was a one and done for us.",

The waiter came took our drink order and dissappeared.. we finally flagged him down and asked if we could at least get bread, he took our orders and then got the bread.. once the drinks came out he forgot to put in two.. so finally after 10 minutes the last 2 drinks apps and bread came out.  The clam chowder was good and the drinks i was told were good also. But once it hut 8 i was getting fed up with the slow service and decided to leave.. the server who didnt seem to care before saw the frustration and became very apologetic. I asked for the manager and he got him right away.. i let the manager know how mediocre the service was as well as how we were waiting since 545 and that it was too late to wait for food.. all he gave were excuses, its the busiest day, the kitchen is backed up so i let him know i didnt want excuses.. so he said your right its  fault its all my fault.. let me remove your items and you can go.. very snarky and could care less i was upset because they were busy.. why over book and continue to take walk ins if you dont have the space.. it's a real shame because out of the party of 10 after an hour of waiting everyone said let's go and I was the one said no let's wait. Thanks for the great Mother's Day experience that my wife mother mother-in-law aunt and all the other ladies received by dining in at your restaurant.  Add on.. my grandmother said that when she was walking to the back for the restroom she heard the staff complaining with the manager about how unreasonable the guests were and that we should just leave if we dont like it. Ridiculous im glad you appreciate the people that help pay your paychecks.",

Finally, I ordered table side shortcake and I was a bit disappointed. Strawberries are out of season and these were completely sour! The cinnamon was too strong and they could have used a better thicker pound cake other than Angels Food cake to absorb all that liquid ;( not worth $13!!

Elegantly decorated- once inside you will forget that you are in Las Vegas. Service was prompt, friendly, and very professional. The menu offered a wide variety of items with a Cajun flare. I ordered the scallop kabob and my guest ordered ribs. We had sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. After dinner we had the brownie dessert and creme brulee. The bill was 80$ and that is when I just didn't feel the wow factor that I was hoping for when I made the reservation. Food was good, just not amazing. I didn't leave thinking about when I might return. I didn't want to tell my friends all about it. I can't put my finger on what was negative or how I would suggest that RK could improve. As the Yelp rating states-- it was just A-Ok. So with that, I say give it a try and decide for yourself.",

I ordered cup of clam chowder, served a large bowl, husband ordered Shrimp Creole with Pasta served Shrimp Scampi, Oysters half shell, dinner salad, and crab cakes ALL CAME AT THE SAME TIME.  Had to send the Shrimp Scampi back, then it came back with  rice. Had to send it back again. Asked the waiter to please put the crab cakes and the Shrimp Creole under the heat lamp while we eat the Oysters, salad, and clam chowder so it does not get cold. The waiter never came around to refresh our water or our wine.This turned into a 2 hour long very un-pleasant dining experience.  We have been customers since this restaurant opened and really miss  the good waiters and waitress that you used to have there.  Very questionable if we will return.",

It's like being transported somewhere in the south. You have to see to believe it :)  The ambience was cozy, romantic. Perfect for date night. Our waiter was very friendly, helpful and accommodating.  We had spinach and artichoke dip with crawfish to start with and it was amazing! It was served with chips but I ended up just spooning the dip in my mouth. It's that good.! For my main dish, I had the crawfish etouffee, the hubby had the sirloin steak special and our little one had mac n cheese. My etoufee was so good. Spicy but not too much. A serving could feed 2 people. The steak was supposed to be okay, nothing special according to the hubby. The mac n cheese, my daughter refused to touch it after the first bite. It had a gasoline taste to it. Our waiter kindly replaced it with baby back ribs which was ok. For dessert, I excitedly ordered beignets. To my surprise, they were not the little pillowy things I was expecting. They were giant pillows. They were kind of tough too, unfortunately. I took the leftovers  home just to see how it can be fixed. Heated it up the next day and they tasted better and the texture was better too.   We liked the place. I just think it was a little overpriced. Might go back again to try their shrimp and grits.",

    "text": "The only reason I'm giving 2 the second star is because the food is actually good, that being said this place is the worst.  I made the mistake of having my wedding reception here based on a recommendation from the culinary school that my husband and I both attended. Through the entire planning process and the actual wedding day we had to deal with (in my opinion) the downfall of this whole place, CW (Chris Washington). He was rude from the start and made us feel like we were an inconvenience to him.  I could get into crazy details but I'll just go over the main points.  The day prior to the wedding my bridal party and I went to set up the room, CW strolls in telling us that he was in the middle of a movie so if we could make it quick because it's his day off that would be great. He disappeared as soon as he showed, so when we were having issues we couldn't track him down for help. After we set up we had a small pile of trash in a box that was from the decorations, I asked where I could throw it out, he informed me to leave it in the main stage and he would take care of it. Not only was it there the next day when the whole wedding arrived, but it stayed there the entire reception and it is in our pictures looking tacky.  Issue number two with what was supposed to be a stress-less beautiful day is that we prepaid $2000 for the venue and food for our reception from 4-8. We had TONS of food out for our guests. I was so busy being a bride that I barely ate, at around 7 I realized how hungry I was only to look over at the buffet table ---which was completely empty. I went up to Chris to ask about it and he told me \"we threw it all away, health code regulations\". MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO CULINARY SCHOOL! We know good and well the health codes, the food was not only perfectly fine but it wasn't his decision to make, we paid for that food and if I wanted 20 Togo boxes then I should've had the option. The food was only out for three hours, and when I asked to see the food in the trash he said it already went to the dumpster.... I know you and your employees ate our food! Crooks!!!!!  Finally, after the wedding we accidentally left a few things behind, a sign on the door, a bag of party favors, and a gift bag that we missed when packing the gifts. When I called to inquire about them I was told nothing was found and sorry.......   Worst experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",

We arrived at 5:00, and we're pleased at how quickly our meal came. We ordered two emtrees and shared everything. We ordered the Crab Cakes Elaine and the Shrimp Brochette and gave both dishes 5 stars!   The Shrimp Brochette featured skewers of bacon wrapped shrimp, peppers and onions. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked...the shrimp were plump and tender and the creamy rice that accompanied  it was amazing (it was a creamy beurre blanc!)  We really enjoyed the flavor of the Crab cakes! They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and smothered in a delicious shrimp etouffe! The etouffe sauce was very rich and flavorful, with a hint of spice, but not too much, and also came with rice.   Both dishes came with sauteed squash and zucchini, which was perfectly cooked al dente and had a hint of garlic taste.  The service was quick and personable...Eric was our server and was very attentive.  In the past we have also enjoyed the Jambalaya and the Catfish with Shrimp Creole, and agreed that Rhythm Kitchen served us one of the top 3 filet mignon we have had at a restaurant!  We came here for Thanksgiving dinner a couple of years ago and it was delicious! We did not have the buffet. We ordered the dinner and we loved the fried turkey!  All of the sides were flavorful and the pies were scrumptious!  We love to keep our eyes out for the $50 Groupon deals (for $25) that are offered from time to time. A good discount always makes the experience more enjoyable!",

My husband had Jambalaya and I had the blackened chicken with pasta and both dishes were meh.

    "text": "We had a Groupon to Rhythm Kitchen that was about to expire, so we made the drive.  Very glad we did, and we will 100% return.  The bread basket is gratis and contains a roll and some hush puppies.  These were fine, not the best bread basket we've had, but it was good.  To start, we had the alligator, 1/2 and 1/2, which is both fried and blackened.  The meat was cooked well, the breading was crispy and light and the blackening seasoning was very flavorful.  I hadn't eaten alligator in many years, and this was exactly how I remembered it.  This was a winner.  We also tried the clam chowder, which had some great flavor and lots of ingredients (clam, potatoes, etc), but the base was a little thin for my taste.  The soup goes very well with the hot sauce on the table.  To eat, I had the N'awlins Seafood Delight, which is 3 good sized pieces of blackened catfish over rice served with shrimp and a Cajun alfredo sauce.  This was serviceable, but I could have used a lot more heat given that it's a Cajun dish.  The sauteed vegetables were good, and you get quite a large side.  I didn't dislike my entree, but I doubt I order it again.  My wife had the filet blackened with stuffed lobster.  You get to choose any side, and she selected macaroni and cheese.  This is made with truffle oil, and I think the chef is a little heavy handed with the truffle.  It was overpowering and pushed the cheese flavor to the background.  It's a good sized dish with a nice crust on top, but the truffle oil overpowered it.  The steak was cooked to a perfect rare, and it was FANTASTIC.  The combination of the blackened seasoning with the steak was a homerun.  I am not a filet guy (I prefer ribeyes) but I had several bites of this steak.  It was juicy despite the lack of fat in filets and it was seasoned perfectly.  It was blackened but not burnt in any spots.  It's in the running for best filet I've ever eaten, as well as best steak I've had off the Strip.  I cannot wait to return to try the 22 ounce bone in ribeye with blackened seasoning.    The stuffed lobster was good, but the crab cake was a little sweet for us.  The lobster was cooked very well and it's a large tail for the price.  We would order the lobster again, but I doubt we get it stuffed next time.  Service was excellent, refills were brought quickly and trips to the bar were also very short.  Lana, our server, was attentive without being overbearing, and had some great suggestions for us.  Very friendly and she allowed us to relax instead of hurrying us out the door.    We will definitely return, it may be a few miles from us in Henderson, but it's easy on and off the 215.  Next time, the blackened ribeye....",

Once we got there we were told that the website does not update correctly into their new system so although we requested the upstairs venue, we had to sit downstairs. We were left to sit and wait with a hostess who talked ENTIRELY to much for another 30 minutes. She constantly interrupted the seating to answer the phone. With her each phone call lasted at least 5 minutes due to her being overly wordy. By the time we were seated there was no where to sit. Once seated it took the waitress another 30 minutes to take our order and another hour to be served. It seems as if Rhythm Kitchen may be under new ownership or management. This visit was far different from our last year experience and other times that we visited.",

Our waiter also seemed quite occupied with other tables as we waited a significant time to get the bill. The food was generally good but, something I could have prepared at home. I was absolutely shocked at how rare my friend's steak was and that the waiter insisted that the food wasn't to my friend's liking. It was outright raw, soft and red. Instead of presenting a new steak that was prepared to my friend's liking, they cooked one sent back till it was well done. My friend wanted a medium rare steak. The sea bass that accompanied the steak was charred, dry and lacked seasoning. We also had to wait an additional 30 minutes for another person's entree. After their entree was screwed up and remade, we noticed we were charged twice for said entree and had to wait an additional 5 minutes for the adjusted bill. Overall, I wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend. You're better off going to a place on the Strip.",

    "text": "Sometimes you need to go back to a place, again and again, before you can really change your first impression.   This is definitely been True with Rhythm Kitchen.  From the very beginning I have wanted to like this place, I crave great cajun cuisine quite often and it helps to have a place you can rely on. Like BBQ, Cajun / Creole restaurants in the Valley mostly fall drastically short of mediocre.  I have been back several times since my first review, and I have to say, I am starting to warm to this place.   Their jambalaya is not great, but it is good enough to get a 3 stars from me.   The rest of the food still lingers around the 3 star range, the service is 3 star for sure these days, up form a dismal 1 star, but it is in the high 3 star range so I go with an overall 3 star review.  Way to go Rhythm Kitchen - keep up the good work.",

He said no I have more change that I was leaving you she waited for it and grabbed his drink that was not empty and walked away. No thank you or sorry for the rude remark after the generous tip. He is normally very cool and calm but he was pissed about this. Not his first bad experience there either",

The reason I gave it 2 stars: to make a long story short, we had went for dinner one evening with a reservation. We were early and still ended up waiting close to an hour. Every person that came in AFTER us in that timeframe was seated within 10-15 mins. We were completely ignored, the hostess never even checked in with us. We ended up walking out without ever being seated or acknowledged after check in. What's most upsetting is that I had reached out to them via website and let them know what happened and how bad our experience was and never even got a response let alone an apology. We used to frequent the establishment at least once a month, but because of this we will not be going back. It's a shame because the food is amazing and it's very affordable.",

We walked in maybe a minute before 6 pm (our scheduled time) and had to wait a good 10-15 minuets for them to get our table ready. Our waiter was horrible. I think we were there nearly three hours. We saw three different parties go through the tables surrounding us. The food was okay, but nothing special. I have definitely had better steak and lobster at more mediocre restaurants. Our waiter was so all over the place he badly burnt the live bananas foster and had to do it again. Would not come back here.",

Well about 3 mins later I get a steak that was a charred mess.  It did not resemble a steak in any way, shape, or form. I touched the end and it crumbled off.  Yes, crumbled. The worst steak ever.  I didn't ask for a new one since I was in a group.  But I will say this. I will never, ever, go to this place and pay for a meal..Undoubtedly the worst ever.  The rest of the food was fairly decent.  But this place should NEVER advertise itself with the word steak in the title.  I wish I would have kept the jumbalaya. At least it looked edible.  And to be fair, it looked like the person next to me who ordered the steak had a decent one.  I think it was unfortunate that I was the one that got the steak that most likely was sent back from a different customer.",

    "text": "Stumbled onto this place on a Friday night at 6pm.  We walked in and liked the decor, which was unique by Vegas standards (i.e. not in a casino or strip mall).  There was a live piano player, table cloths, etc. - fancy but not stuffy. We had the kids with us, and they brought a kids menu with crayons. It was early, and the place was about 25% full. Upon our questioning of the menu, the waitress smiled and admitted it was her second day.  She was really good though.  I appreciate her honesty rather than trying to BS us to upsale the check. I had the Atchafalaya Crawfish Delight.  The blackened catfish was great, as was the cajun rice.  The \"seasonal vegetable medley\" turned out to be green beans.  These were clearly frozen green beans that were heated.  I gave them to my kid who is used to eating such veggie delights so it was cool, but I expected more.  That being said, the crawfish-etouffee-covered-blackened-catfish was good enough for me to get over it. My husband had the Rhythm Kitchen Platter.  We all (kids included) had a frog's leg, which was fun.  Other than that, it very good. He had the greens as a side - lots of shredded pork included without being too salty as greens sometimes are. Kids shared a pepperoni pizza, which was better than expected since we were at a cajun seafood place.   Good place.  Sure we'll be back.",

I love the laid back atmosphere and the aroma. I was there for an event upstairs. There was no air conditioning, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I didn't want to experience the humidity of Baton Rouge in August, but all the rest of the two-story-plantation-like ambiance I wanted! As a rule I NEVER stay for dinner at networking events. Well, I did last night and I'm glad I did. The service and the food were excellent. The char-grilled chicken with the rice and veggies were so delish! My companion had blackened chicken that was also very good. The hush puppies and rolls were to frick frackin die for. I had to control myself or I wouldn't have enough room for din din. Being Italian-Lebanese I am a huge bread eater. Our server Robert was attentive, knowledgeable and a plethora of information on just about anything we asked. I had a very good time! But I was MELTING. Fix the air!! If I don't have a good hair day and I am sweating like a ho in church...... it's not good. Would I go again? Absolutely! When the air is on....",

For dinner, again great atmosphere and great service.  I am kind of a wimp when it comes to spice, so I was not brave enough to try any of their specialties and stuck with what I know.  I started with a house salad and then got a filet which was phenomenal.  I sampled tastes from my family Filet Oscar (OMG yum!) and French onion soup (delicious).  My dad loved the jambalaya and he's hard to please with new food choices.  Great wine list too!  Sadly, it's far from where I live and a little out of my price range (but very comparable for similar restaurants of this type) as a place to go frequently, but we'll be back for more special occasions.",

Otherwise, this place is generally dead when it comes to the social atmosphere.

    "text": "We had reservations since it was a Friday night and we were seated right away.  Our waitress was really great, thus the two stars.  She, however, could not make up for the horrible, inedible food that was served to us.  Starting with the breadbasket, the meal was a disaster.  The hush puppies were little balls on greasy, undercooked hush puppies.  We had two appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and the crab cakes.  The green tomatoes were the worst I have ever had and the same can be said for the crab cakes.  The breading on the tomatoes was under spiced.  The crab cakes were under spiced and we were questioning if there was any crab there at all.  I ordered the jambalaya, and the only explanation for it was that it had been made a couple of days before.  The shrimp and chicken were so over cooke they were inedible.  Not to mention the base which was mush.  I complained about it and it was taken off the bill in the end.  My sister ordered the fried oysters dinner, and it was almost inedible.  The oysters had the same breading as the green tomatoes, which has way too much cornmeal in it, and the oysters were way over cooked.  My niece ordered appetizer size of ribs and a side order of broccoli, which she said were good.  We thought, how could they mess up dessert?  So we decided to try the beignets and bread pudding to share.  The beignets had uncooked dough in the middle.  The bread pudding was the worst I have had, ever.  And I love bread pudding and have eaten all over the world.  The bread pudding was like day old bread with a little milk poured over it, served in a large square, that was cold, with a hot bourbon sauce poured over it.  Inside of the large square was dry hunks of bread.  They took that off of our bill as well.  But even with the two items taken off the bill, it was very expensive, especially for the bad quality of food served.   I have been to New Orleans and have eaten great creole food.  This is not even close.  I will never go back.",

Jane was our server again and she was tops!  The pianist played everything from the usual fare to classical...and he actually enjoys doing it!  Great atmosphere and Friday night had quite a few of the Las Vegas Who's Who there!   This place is 100's of times better than the typical Las Vegas \"long wait to be seated\" places!!  We highly recommend!!!  Thank you, Rhythm for bringing class and great food to the neighborhood!  Btw- the artichoke dip appetizer is Out of This World!  :)",

    "text": "This was my first time going to the Rhythm Kitchen.  We ordered the Broiled Oysters, Etouffe with Crawfish, Cobb salad, Gumbo, and Strawbery Shortcake for dessert.  The waiter was very slow in bringing out our food, however, he was very knowledgeable about all of the menu items.  I must say that we were extremely dissappointed with the Broiled Oysters.  It was $11 for 6 oysters.  Ok, no problem.  But the oysters were really small (almost as of they cut an oyster into 4 pieces and placed 1 piece into the shell when serving).  It was covered in sauce so you couldn't really tell much other than it was really, really small.  The sauce was so so, and the oysters didn't taste fresh.  I am use to having my oysters at the 777 Brewery at the Main Street Station Casino (the absolute freshest oysters ever) and very reasonably priced!  The Etouffe with Crawfish was awesome though and we really enjoyed that.  The Cobb salad was good as well, although the bacon used on the salad was not freshly fried bacon, but rather, it tasted like the bottled stuff you buy.  If I'm paying $7 for a tiny side salad everything had better be freshly prepared, period.  The Gumbo was average, I've had better, but acceptable.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the Strawberry Shortcake!  The picture on the menu looked fabulous and I am a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan.  Guess what came to the table?  Two slices of storebought pound cake, covered with whipped cream (the whipped cream was freshly made, at least they did that) and drizzled on top was frozen strawberries in sauce (looked like the stuff I buy at Smart n Final).  I was expecting fresh strawberries and maybe some homemade poundcake!  What was I thinking?",

    "text": "First off I have to say the steak and the Mai Tai were very good, the other diners with us all enjoyed their entrees. This is why they get a bad review. We waited in the bar for our entire party to arrive and after 30 minutes of waiting at a table and then going up to the bar and being asked if we had been helped and reminding them, I finally got my drink. People at other tables and next to us at the bar were already on a second drink. I had to flag the bartender down again several times to get my check.  I complained to the hostess and she told me she would have the manager come over to our table, but no one ever did. Then we went to the dining room for dinner. The service was a prompt in taking our order and getting us beverages. But it was a really long time getting our meal and then our dessert. The creme brulee was runny and having never having beniets before, I am not sure how they were supposed to taste, but they didn't have any flavor. Then came the bill. I informed the waiter we had a Groupon at the beginning of the meal and he told me to give it to him at the end. He brought me the check and then I had to flag him down to remind him of the Groupon. He took it off the check and brought it back with my new bill (the gratutity was already on the check). I paid the balance in cash and a few minutes later the waiter comes back to the table and tells me it is $20 short. I appoligize thinking i gave him a $5 instead of a $20(it was really dark in our section) and give him $20 more dollars. When I get home I check my wallet (i knew exactly how much I had prior to the evening) and sure enough I was $20 short, he stole $20 from me. I can't believe it. Always pay with a credit card!",

I added salt and pepper to fish but it didn't get any better. Our server went MIA and our buser was busy tending to a large party in their banquet room so it was pointless to say anything. I think they forgot to slap some rub on it and let it leave the kitchen this way. We also ordered ribs from the kids menu to go for my son and that had more food and flavor than my $45 plate.

BBQ Ribs were tender and fall of the bone. Shrimp Brochette is grilled and served on a skewer with vegetables. Kobe sliders (3 to an order) were very juicy. Fried Tomatoes have a nice crunchy coating.    However the night we were there the service was extremely slow. Our waiter was handling the drink and the food service for 6 tables. If the service was more prompt I would rate it 4 stars",

Lets not even talk about the gator that I was exited about ro try. I ordered 2, one to be deep fried and the other blackened. Never saw the blackened,  i got 2 deepfried in a separate box. Opened the box it looked like 6 little popcorn chicken in each. Thise things were 13 bucks each, I was pissed! I felt robbed and bamboozled.

My only real beef is that they charged us a 20% gratuity for 2 people at a buffet. I read previous reviews complaining about the gratuity applied to groups of 3, but a couple who orders one round of bar drinks and gets their own food shouldn't be charged gratuity. Wish I could comment on our server but we maybe saw him twice which also makes one wonder about gratuity charges. Shady practices beat out decent food unfortunately. Probably won't be back.",

I ordered the raw oyster and tuna for the appetizer and steak for the entree. Raw Oyster: The oysters were big and fresh, very satisfy. Tuna: Taste about average. Steak: The waitress warns me that steak is huge. If I like medium-rare, I better order the medium, because it is hard to cook through. I end up order the medium, but it comes out medium-well. I did not complain at that time because the steak still tastes good. The waitress better not giving people the wrong information again.  Service: It is pretty obvious they lack staff, the host boy is cleaning the table and changing table cloth. The lady who wore kitchen uniform was delivering food in the front of the house. The servers are friendly, but they do need more help to run the business.  Overall: Little pricey, staff shortage, good food. I end up choosing another restaurant to take care of my big party group.",

There is also an upstairs that was closed off on this Saturday evening due to an event. Its located off the beaten path right off 215 and Decatur. We were there about 20 mins earlier for our reservation but the hostess offered us seating in Happy Hour section. This section is still really nice and was pretty packed. It took about 25 minutes to even see a waitress. We ordered two cocktails, and we didnt see the waitress for about another 25 minutes to take our order. It appeared she was the only one working happy hour area-- Wow! There were about 8 tables PLUS the actual bar top. Food was Ok and took forever to come out.(35 mins) We were told that they were also short staff on the kitchen.. smh.. Gumbo in Garlic Bread Bowl- Seasoned well, but luke warm and runny. Also didnt come with the crab as described on menu Catfish & Shrimp Creole- very good tomatoe topping and fish cooked perfectly. Green beans were a little undercooked Filet & Dirty Rice- Cooked perfectly.. buttery and great smoky flavor on steak Strawberry Madagascar- Lacking in presentation. The waitress actually left because she forgot something while pan was in front of us still cooking. Table cloth that food was on was extremely dirty. Tasty though Key Lime- Perfect! Just enough sour and sweet, tasty buttery crust. Not sure if its worth coming back as I now notice that customer service is an issue by seeing others reviews..",

And the food was was about as close to New Orleans fair as one can hope to achieve outside of Louisiana.   Oysters on the 1/2 Shell: flown in daily from The Gulf, these succulent big-as-your-palm beauties are served with a fresh, sharp horseradish and a cocktail sauce. I was astounded to find that they served Shiner Bock on tap, and the Texan in me just had to go for a cold one and oysters.  N'awlins Delight (blackened catfish in a subtle cream sauce with shrimp): oh my goodness, pure heaven. The flavorful sauce paired with the blackening was absolute perfection, with the fish moist and flaky. Served with rice and al dente veggies, it was a delight for the palate.  Etouffee: Wow! A beautifully dark musky roux was absolute perfection. Crawfish and/or shrimp, both are a suburb addition. And along with the freshly made French rolls... I have to say it again... Wow!   We were too full for dessert, but beignets and fried ice cream will defiantly be on the menu next time we are here!  And get this... On Tuesday evenings they have all you can eat crab legs! Sunday nights is all you can eat catfish! Oh yeah, we'll be coming back here again soon!   Lola's, take note, y'all have got some serious competition!",

    "text": "I took my mom and boys here yesterday for dinner. Before I get started, let me just say: This rating is a hardcore one because I'm originally from the south, have eaten in New Orleans many times and come from a long line of great southern cooks.   The environment/atmosphere was theme-wise, on point. The hostess was what you'd expect I suppose. Our server was extremely nice and attentive and I tipped her accordingly. In fact, honestly everyone seem nice or at least pleasant enough to make you have an enjoyable experience. From the other reviews I read, I was not necessarily expecting but prepared for quite the opposite.   As I stated above, I'm summed up as a pretty hard but certainly fair food critic. The food wasn't that impressive especially for the prices. I don't have a problem with spending a good deal about of money on food because it's an experience for me and something I greatly enjoy. I do have a problem with spending a lot of money on mediocre food. Perhaps it was what we ordered that didn't impress me which was: Seafood Gumbo, Alligator Tail, Frog Legs, Fried Crawfish w/Fries, Shrimp (which were fried also - My mom did however love it) and ribs (for my little guy). My youngest son said the best part was his Caesar salad because he liked all the dressing they accidentally poured.   Overall, the food wasn't bad, but unfortunately it wasn't what I hoped it was. I will definitely go back to try some other dishes simply because the service from my waitress was great. I wish I remembered her name. She was a younger Asian woman with a smile that brightened your heart. And no, I'm not a creepy dude  I just appreciate good service.   I'd say if you've never had real N'Oleans food, you'd probably really like this place. So go try it out.   PS: My only Tip would be, after reading other reviews, avoid eating here on popular holidays where any restaurant would be overly crowded or busy and instead go on an off night of the week so that you experience it for what it is without uncommon distractions.",

But, the easy jazz (Yanni style) wasn't quite the rhythm I expected, especially considering the entrance.   The dining room is cozy, and was pleasantly full on a random Thursday evening. And now for the studs and the duds of our meal:   The Studs: the hush puppies served along with bread as your meal-starter; the crabcakes were nicely made -- good ratio of crab to other stuff; and the blackened catfish was also well prepared.   The Duds: the scallop app - no flavor to the scallops, though they were well-cooked; the crispy calamari was heavily breaded and deep fried - YUCK; and the crawfish etouffee was poorly spiced and a far cry from the goodness I know.   I agree with some of my other Yelpers --- the food that was good was really good; and the food that was bad was exactly that. Service was slow but friendly in an otherwise nice atmosphere (minus the Yanni music).",

We got there about 10 mins early and were seated immediately at a very nice booth. The only problem was there was a big group next to us having a bday party with about 15 or so people who were being very loud. :(.  The server was good but if she wasn't servicing this large group I think it would've been exceptional. Got a free app to start by joining their email club. Shrimp and crab cocktail. Shrimp was pretty good but crab could've been a little fresher and had a few shells. I would pass on this. Husband had a 22 ounce prime ribeye that was on special for 44 dollars served with garlic mashed and asparagus. Steak had a great char on outside and cooked a perfect med rare. He enjoyed it very much. Now on to my crab legs.. They were very fresh and perfectly steamed. Every piece came out in one whole piece and were juicy and sweet ( I'm a crab extracting expert though hee) I might've ate ten lbs I'm not sure but I left super full and extremely happy. Am going to try happy hour next time. Would've been 5 stars except for noisy crowd and slowish service.",

Two of our group enjoyed plate after plate after plate (and yes, I could go on) of the all you can eat crab legs - apparently they enjoyed the crab legs.  I, myself, do not enjoy crab so I went with a shrimp pasta alfredo-type dish which I enjoyed greatly.

Maybe three other dinning parties when we arrived. Ordered oysters, gumbo, and one of the pasta dishes. The food was average. Worth the price on the menu. The service was completely non existent. The first thing we ordered were our drinks. The waiter came back with them 15 minutes later (After the appetizer and when the main course was being served) with a mumbling apology about the bartender. Everything we needed the waiter for was either late or never arrived. We ended up walking away from half our dessert because the waiter would not bring us a to-go container. If you want to try this place just get take out. The service is possibly the worst I have ever had in Las Vegas. Never Again.

Hubby had Etouffee and he liked it but had better elsewhere.  We all had Caesar salads, very tasty and the only dressing not made in-house. I had the Shrimp Brochette Appetizer with a salad for dinner, the shrimp with bacon could have cooked a little longer so all meats could cook through. Had a stomach problem later that evening. Bread Pudding, good, Beinget too doughy and overly powdered with sugar.  Nothing spicy, though I thought the Etouffee would be.  Service, well we had a reservation and the hostess wanted to seat us at the first table as you walked in to the main dining room when most all tables at that time were empty.  We asked for another table and she really didn't want to move us any further than the table next to it because as she said, later reservations were planned for those tables. Why in the world would you seat people at the first table everyone has to walk by when there were available tables the same size further in?  Our waiter and his assistant were good!   Friends have been here and loved it.  Not sure if there's been a change somewhere down the line. We probably won't be back.",

Surprisingly, we went in at 5pm & the lot was full & it was essentially crowded due to (probably) the east coasters eating early since it's really 8 pm for them.  By 6pm, some were done & had left & even more couples were arriving for dinner.

Honestly, if I didn't have a Groupon for this meal, I would've been very unhappy to pay for this dish.  The hushpuppies were served with the bread and were not hot which was very strange. The saving grace was the wonderful gumbo and jambalaya. I would go back for those 2 items only.",

    "text": "We have been here before, and enjoyed it.  But, this last time was terrible.  It was our son's birthday.  First, his wife's iced tea had something floating in it.  If not for the rest of the evening, wouldn't have given that a 2nd thought.  My wife got lobster, and it was woefully under cooked.  The server took it back.  It took a long time for it to be brought back to the table.  I was nearly done with my meal.  Upon return is was so rubbery it couldn't easily be chewed.  So, like our son, my wife then requested the all you can eat crab.  The crab was good, but getting more was sporadic, and they never brought additional butter/lemon when they brought more crab.  We had to request it every time.  I requested Beignets for desert, which I love and would have been the highlight of the meal for me.  They were woefully under cooked, to the point I didn't eat them, which is a serious rarity for me.  As an \"apology\" the server brought us a Creme Brulee, \"which everyone loves\".  And, actually, our son and my wife do love it.  But, the top was mostly dark brown to black.  Our son did try a bite from the very small area that was about the correct color, and it took him some effort to break through the sugar.  The sugar was so thick that while it was a medium brown on top, it was still grainy underneath.  We suspected that was why the top was so dark, that they kept the torch going to try to get through the overly thick layer.  We wondered, we don't know this, if it was served to someone else and sent back, and therefore available to give to us.  Other than that bite, it wasn't eaten.  The server indicated that the manager would be by the table, so we waited for the check.  The manager never came by and then the server brought the check.  To their credit, they removed the lobster and the Beignets from the bill.  But, it was our last time here.",

    "text": "An exceptional experience with Cajun food + white table cloth service and charming staff + delicately lit dining room, and gorgeous views of Las Vegas through large glass windows (if you get a seat upstairs).  My family and I came to Rhythm Kitchen during Las Vegas Restaurant Week. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and waited for the hostess to prep our table. After we were ushered into their dining room, which is classy, yet has a feeling that you will be served Cajun/French Creole food from the heart.  Not everyone in my party dined on the RW Menu, but I did, as did my mother and God-mother.   For starters when I checked into Yelp the restaurant offered a free drink, including their house wines. I opted for the white, a Chardonnay that was decent, but not anything surprising. My father ordered the house Merlot, also a decent varietal, but nothing special. However, they do have an extensive wine menu that I glazed over seeing numerous choices from France, Spain, and the like.  Next - for appetizer my family opted for two orders of the alligator tail, one grilled with a spicy seasoning and the other deep fried. The alligator was surprisingly tender and had the consistency of a medium-well done steak. I like both versions, but preferred the grilled with the extra spice.  We were also served tasty, warm rolls and hush puppies with honey-butter. AMAZING hush puppies. Deep-fried to perfection, and a lovely spicy taste... I think there must have been some jalapenos added to the batter. But these were quite addictive.  As for my order, I started with the Cashew Vinaigrette Salad- Mixed Greens In A Spicy Cashew Vinaigrette Topped With Red Onions, Red Peppers & Crispy Wontons. The addition of red onions and red peppers to this salad made all the difference, adding spiced-up flavors one does not typically have in a garden varietal salad. The crispy wontons add a very nice mix to the mouth-feel and are kind of like a \"better'\" version of a crouton.  Next up, main course: N'Awlins Seafood Delight- Blackened Catfish Over Rice With A Rich & Creamy Alfredaux With Shrimp. This was a delicious, creamy main course. The catfish was main star, having a flaky grilled exterior, and a melty white fish center. And it was a good portion. Shrimp were plentiful as well, no skimp on the shrimp here. The alfredaux pulls everything together, making you believe you are in New Orleans... not South Las Vegas.  Lastly, dessert. Homemade Bread Pudding Served With Bourbon Sauce. Their bread pudding was certainly... different. It is a firm cake, dense. The bourbon sauce here is served cold and it is a white sauce (some places offer brown). I was not a fan. I was expecting a warm bread pudding and a warm white sauce. The was neither. But. It wasn't *bad* and had a very NUTMEG flavor to it. It is just different, that is all.  Overall - Service was prompt, genuine and our server was congenial to our large group. Food overall was as expected with pops of surprises and flourishes of creativity from whoever is chef here. I would certainly come back.",

Atmosphere and service still great!    Good deals on all you can eat crab night and all you can eat rib night!  The disappointment was the tuna tar tar, ranch dressing on my salad tasted like mayonnaise, and my favorite blackened chicken pasta (tri color rottini ruined it) which should have been served with a mosticolli noodle.    Note: do not take kids there...my three year old ordered the mac n cheese...it came out with bread crumbs and pepper on the fries ~kids do not like spinach pasta! Still love the place but will be pickier next time I order.",

Just buy frozen pizza from the same place you buy the frozen alligator nuggets and give that a shot.    I'm only coming back for alcohol if there is another visit.",

    "text": "I did not have a pleasant experience at this restaurant a couple weeks ago for my mothers birthday. I wanted it to have a very special dinner for my mother and there were so many hidden charges, that were not communicated with me up front. Our waiter was not as attentive toward our table even though it was not that crowded that night. Very slow service and it took a while for our food to come out which made my family and myself upset. The bad experience began when I wanted to surprise my mother with her favorite type of cake that I had purchased. I went back outside to grab the cake to keep it a secret from my mother. When I came back in I asked the hosts up front if I may keep the cake in the fridge. The young  man said yes then asked would you like us to cut it for you, there is a cutting fee. I said no, that's okay we can cut it ourselves it would be nice if you could just present it, and the young man mad it seem like that was no problem. Later on come to find out I did not have a choice I was either going to pay them or we wont have a cake in the restaurant. That was not made clear at all in the beginning when I first talked to the hosts. The waiter explained that the cutting fee is about $2 per person and we had a party of seven. I was so thrown off. And explained to the waiter I did not want you all to cut the cake. But since they brought the cake out they wanted that fee. I was so disappointed that this was not made clear and asked to speak to the manager. The manager came to our table and was so stoic and unsympathetic. When I explained that I felt like I was paying for their mistake he said  how they should have known. Then he simply just walked away. It seemed as if he didn't care. I felt terrible that I had to complain about this in front of family members and on my mother's special day. They did not charge the cake cutting fee, but I was so thrown off by the miscommunication and by the manager. The manager seemed to lack basic social skills which came off as if he did not care. On top of that the waiter said he would take off a meal that my aunt did not enjoy when we double checked the receipt he had still put the meal on the bill. So it took more time to wait for him to correct this mistake. I was not pleased and was ready to leave after the bad customer service. I would not recommend if you want a nice peaceful evening with your family. All I wanted was a pleasant evening for my mother on her special day.",

    "text": "Ive been to this place twice so far. The first time was with girlfriends back in 2013 and we had a great time. We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment.   The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22).   Overall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",

    "text": "We had a Groupon and some errands, so dinner at Rhythm Kitchen was our play. Afterward, I will say that the Groupon lessened the blow this place had on us. We arrived relatively early in their flow - there were 3 other tables when we arrived and 3 more were seated while we dined. The place looks well appointed and the servers are attentive. It is not overly decorated and nothing about it says southern, Cajun, creole, bayou or Louisiana. It could pass for a steak house, Italian place, upscale American or even Greek. There is no atmosphere to it. Our server took great care of us, flowing by every once in a while to check on us and asking how things were.  I wish I could have really told him, but since words like bland, plain and pedestrian would be used, there's not much he could have done. After reading other reviews, I am convinced the chef/owner is not there on Wednesday nights. It is sad that caliber of food comes out of the kitchen. We had such high hopes. We first received the bread basket. While the yeast bread was good, we weren't much on the hush puppies. They were a bit heavy and not much punch to them. That said, we know hush puppies are an individual thing. Not everyone likes all of them. They just weren't for us. The weird thing was the butter served with it. I am not certain what the tang is. It almost seemed like it had been mixed with something like sour cream, but the second pat didn't taste like the first and it was then that it seemed like they use unsalted butter...maybe that was it. We started our meal with the crawfish tail appetizer. This was quite tasty. The tails are small, but you just eat three or four at a time. They are lightly dusted and fried. Since we wanted to try a selection of what they offered, I ordered the Seafest Platter and the wife ordered the Big Easy Sampler. Overall, both of these were very disappointing. The catfish fillets were good, but did taste like small pond fish. They had a nice crust and were only slightly greasy. The breading on the oysters were lacking in flavor. The oysters themselves were good, but the little wads of crust took away from them. There was nothing special about the fried shrimp. As a matter of fact they were no better than any other fired shrimp anywhere else. Same with the cold boiled shrimp - I would also make the observation that placing cold shrimp among just fried items is not the best idea (one piece was actually still a bit frozen in the middle). The alligator bits were very tasty. They were the stars of both our dishes. The frog legs did not rise to the same level. While they were good, they were only passible. The demons of the dinner were the crab cakes. I have never had anything so distasteful ever. I am not sure what they were going for with those, but the sour, bitter and basically foul taste ruined me on these dishes. I actually had to spit out the piece I had cut off and absolutely could not eat any of it. I cannot think of any word to describe the horrid taste of these crab cakes. The icing on the cake was the beans and rice. Plain white rice and bitter beans - they almost tasted burned. I couldn't even finish those. Let me state, I grew up in the south, both along the coast and inland. I have fished, gigged, plucked, trapped, netted and caught most of these (except for the alligator) as well as cooked them. That said, the items we had for dinner were nowhere near what one would expect from such a restaurant. Plain, bland and just not good. We've had better flavor from a bag of Zatarain's. Then I check reviews and see that our meal items look nothing like any pictures posted by other reviewers. *this must be how they get back at folks who use Groupons. This is why we feel the chef is off on Wednesdays. We can't believe he would let this stuff be served.",

My two children ordered the turkey dinner which was complete with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and even a slice of pie. The turkey was cooked and seasoned perfectly, with a pleasant aftertaste and was moist to boot. My husband ordered the filet - oscar style - which includes a crab cake on top with Bernaise sauce, which was out of this world. The filet was tender and juicy, and the crab cake was large and perfectly cooked (no skimpy crab here - it was full of large chunks of crab meat).   I ordered the Cajun platter with catfish, shrimp, and crab legs (hey, you only love once, right?). Everything tasted delightful, and was crispy - not soggy - like some other restaurants. Our waitstaff ensured our experience was one of a kind, and my daughter even compared the ambiance and food to a certain Disney movie involving a frog-prince.  It was a delightful experience and I would absolutely recommend this Restaraunt to anyone who loves New Orleans style Cajun food!",

Had the seafood platter which looked liked a fried soggy mess that came from an easy bake oven of a four year old. They try to charge and arm and leg for something that I could get better from the frozen food aisle at Wal-Mart. I am not a \"foodie\" hater but, I also will not hesitate to share my experiences whether they be good or bad.. and in this case Rhythm Kitchen was waaaaaaay off beat.",

The salad was full of egg, bacon, red pepper, mushrooms, and onion.   I ordered the petite filet (6 oz) which rivaled the best I've had!  Cooked perfectly with a side of cajun rice and veggies!  My dad's Seafest Platter was a buffet of perfectly cooked seafood!  I tried his shrimp and know what I'm getting next time!   My mother's jambalaya (with shrimp) was filling and the right spice!   We were all in heaven and will definitely return.   The only slight hesitation with the 5 stars was that I wanted a glass of chardonnay, and the wine menu was not geared toward \"by the glass.\"  They only offered one type of chardonnay by the glass.  It was good, but $11.",

I'm don't disagree with the previous reviewers about their experiences but I simply didn't experience the same.  We used a groupon for our meals that came with a glass of wine each but we wanted to try multiple wines so management gladly allowed us to each have the sampler so that we could both enjoy a variety of different wines offered there. We  sampled delicious rose wines and rieslings, as well as some fancy reds.   The building is quite beautiful, as is the interior. They played soft jazz, creating a pleasant, romantic experience for my girlfriend and I. I'm no expert on southern architecture but I get the impression that it was designed to mimic a fancy southern dining hall and I absolutely loved it. The decorations and color schemes were very consistent with their lousiana theme and you all know how much I love me some well done ambiance.   The staff was friendly and accomodating and they were happy to give us clarification on the finer points of the menu, as well as to give us their personal recommendations. I ended up ordering the seafood over whole wheat penne, which included the crawfish that I was so desperately craving. My girlfriend had a cajun rice dish that included some tasty Andouille sausage. Our dishes were well seasoned-- not dry, not overcooked. They didn't skimp on the seafood or the portions over all. We declined to try their dessert because we were just so stuffed (and cheap) but it did sound pretty amazing. On my next trip here, I think we'll have to try one of those things.",

Before we decided to walk out I asked our server if they served beer, he said \" of course!\" And brought over the beer menu.  He then started talking to us about beer and was extremely knowledgeable on beers as well as everything else on the menu.  We decided to stay based on his service alone.  I ordered the crescent city pasta and my boyfriend ordered the AYCE shrimp special.  The clam chowder starter and pasta was pretty good but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.  I like the location, ambience and great service but unless I'm celebrating some sort of special occasion I would rather save a little $$ and dine at either boiling crab or at an oyster bar at a casino.  I wouldn't mind trying this place out for happy hour and appetizer and/or dessert, or coming back for with a group and checking out the lounge.",

We attended last week on Friday after the air show. We arrived 5 minutes before opening and we were the 1st to be seated. Business picked up quickly and there another 4 families sat within the first 10 minutes of opening.   The ambiance of the venue is great, the live pianist was ok as well, his toupee was horrendous though...just saying!   The food was great!  For our appetizer we had the calamari. It was VERY fresh! My husband ordered the all you can eat catfish and was fully satisfied. I had the crawfish etouffee, it was fabulous. They definitely don't skimp on the crawfish, which I love and that was very fresh as well. The dish is also not for person who does not like SPICE! For dessert we had the beignets and they were good...not Cafe Du Monde good but good and the portions were large ;0)  The service is where the issue is. I hope the owner reads this review because it was inexcusable how bad the service was. Their host was even bussing and waiting on tables...Giovanni was very helpful and even apologized for our poor service. Our server for the night was Erin. We waited 10 minutes for a refill on our drinks at one point after reminding Erin twice. If you decide to eat here, hope that you don't get seating in his area. It took us 2 hours and 20 minutes from beginning to end, which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. 3 tables that were say in a different section and seated after us left waaaaaaaaaaaaaay before us.   I will say the food is great, the service badly needs to be addressed hire more or get better quality servers.  Happy dining!",

So we arrived on Fathers Day around 5:15 - 5:30 and was told they can sit us faster in the patio which we were okay with. So we went to the lounge to have drinks while they got the table ready. Within 15 minutes The bartender advised us our table was ready. Well the patio is in the back completely out of site of the restaurant.  So we sat for 15 minutes and no one came to the table to greet us. I went to complain and apparently the wait staff did not know anyone was back there. The sun is beaming so I went back in to ask if they had patio umbrellas which they don't.  I asked again if we can sit inside cause obviously no one knows we are out there and they said no.   Now the best part. We place our order for our dinner about 6:15. Well 40 minutes later NOTHING. Hostess claim the fryer in the kitchen broke and they are slammed in the kitchen.  It is now over an hour. I had to go back to the hostess and demand for the general manager. The GM came to the table and again more excuses. Food starts arriving around 8:15 pm. The food came out cold, salty and not cooked all the way AND not everyone's meal came out.    Pathetic how this establishment is ran and the lack of respect they have for their customers.",

    "text": "Disclaimer:  This review is based on the average of my last 5 visits to Rhythm Kitchen.  The previous 4 visits were 5 stars and we had become regulars.  The last, however, was a rough one to put it mildly.  This last visit gets 1 star.   My friends and I usually love this place and it's because of our previous visits that I'm staying positive with this review.  The goal is to hopefully help them correct the myriad of mistakes that occurred during our last visit.    1)  Attention to allergic sensitivities.  I had requested no black pepper on my ribeye which first came out as a filet.  When the correct steak came out it had black pepper on it.  I'm only mildly allergic and was pretty hungry by then, so I just ate it.  My friend, however, doesn't eat meat and her salad was found to have bacon in it after she had had a few bites.  This was also mentioned at time of order.    2) Timing.  We still had most of our appetizer in front of us when 3 of the 4 dishes arrived.  Of the 3 out of 4 dishes, 1 was correct.  Even if all 3 dishes were correct and delicious, the 4th ribeye didn't come out until my 2nd steak arrived.  When we discovered bacon in my friend's salad, it was assumed she didn't want it replaced.  So my friend sat there for some time under the impression that a replacement salad without bacon was coming.  We had to ask for a replacement.    3)  Management.  This one was actually what caused me to write this review at all.  After the many apologies and attempts to correct the issues we had, NO MANAGER CAME TO TALK TO US.  I didn't even see anyone who looked remotely like a manager.  Mistakes happen.  Everyone of us at the table works or has worked in the restaurant industry.  But to not even address our issues is either lazy or just didn't care.    I truly hope Rhythm Kitchen takes this as constructive criticism because we really do enjoy the food and service.",

    "text": "Absolutely Fabulous!  This is a restaurant I have been dying to try for years!. Well, I finally made it and Im so happy to report... I love it!  If you love authentic cajun/creole food from New Orleans, than you must go! Las Vegas does not have many choices for this type of cuisine. Its on  Decatur/ 215freeway less than 10 minutes West of the strip. Definitely worth it!  The building is traditional Orleans decor and is splendidly decorated on the inside. The grand staircase is gorgeous and feels like you are in the French Quarter! We didnt have reservations, but no problem, we were seated right away in a sexy corner booth with a view.  Check in on Yelp to receive a 'Buy one drink, get one free'. Who doesnt love a free drink!  Our waiter 'Tyler' was very knowledgeable with all the specials and recommended a few dishes to start. We had the special appetizer of fried green tomatoes with lump crab meat(Spectacular) and an order of blackened/deep fried alligator tail(YES!). For main course we had crawfish etouffee and the new orleans special with catfish, shrimp and green beans. Also, your meal comes with a basket of sourdough bread and honey butter..who doesn't love some honey!  Each dish had its own texture and flavor. My favorite dish was the new orleans special, the sauce on the catfish and shrimp was 'Heaven'  I wish my stomach was bigger, as I wanted to keep eating!  The experience was fabulous, from the food to the service to the company we shared.  Highly Recommend! Im going back for more!",

My husband is from the gulf coast and is hard to please! Our waiter was new and was a great guy. Oh yes my husband loved the gumbo. We had a small dish of the pickled green tomatoes they were yum just a little small on portion. Mac n cheese was also a win. My only negative was the Madagascar strawberry short cake was really over priced and not so good. The strawberry's we not ripe and the short cake was very stale. Disappointing. Other wise our over all dining experience was wonderful and we will be going .",

Long story short I ended up placing an order for Togo through yelp which didn't work some type of disconnect there, So CALL or GO IN and order your food don't do it through yelp! So I get there food isn't ready the hostess was kind enough to retake the order and then get it out as soon as possible. Food comes out, spoke with the manager in regards to the issues encountered with ordering through yelp. Get home, starved at this point ready to eat we open the boxes and the disappointment was real, one little dry catfish filet, a couple of shrimp, oysters, and that was it plus the sides we ordered, no boiled shrimp as stated on the yelp Togo order description. I wish I could say I'll be giving this place a try again but after all this disappointment I don't think I'll be coming back again.",

Initially we were very pleased, the food was good, the servers were friendly and helpful. Towards the end of the meal, one of the soda refills was given a bitter vile tasting liquid that made him immediately spit the fluid out. We summoned a server, who took the liquid and shared it with our server...both returned to say that there was indeed a problem with the liquid. They apologized and informed us that the manager would be over shortly to speak with us. We waited more than 30 minutes for someone in management to appear, ultimately we paid our tab and left. Understand, we DID NOT expect any recompense for the vile liquid that was served, but acknowledgement from someone in charge would have indicated that they cared...so, Las Vegas...were we wrong to expect someone to care?",

But everything seemed to go wrong all the staff appeared to be overwhelmed.   1. The waiter was telling another table that it's a busy day and they should learn to be patient. In my opinion that was poor response and customer service to a complaint of someone's food being cold.   2. When we finally were able to order a beverage I wanted Pellegrino and tap water was served along with something black in the middle of my ice cubes.  3. We waited about 15 mins for bread and by that point I was willing to take my chances with Five Guys and I only like their fries and peanuts.  So I excused myself after 35 minutes before ordering.   Will I try to go back and give them another chance, hmmm idk!",

    "text": "If you want Cajun Creole Cooking while in Vegas, THIS is the place! My wife and I celebrated our 7 year Anniversary in Vegas and I just looked up restaurants on line. Although this is approx 15 min from the strip the Trip was well worth it. My wife had the Shrimp Scampi with linguini and spinach ( and she don't even like spinach!) and I had the Blackened Catfish with Shrimp Etouffee, which our awesome server Shannon suggested. The catfish was blackened and has a nice spice kick to it. OH and I can't forget the jalapeno hush puppies! They will definitely, As my great grandmother would say, \"Hush Yo Mouth!\"  This place has three areas: A buffet area upstairs. A beautiful dining area with jazzy r&b music, and a Lounge where you can catch sports. Due to the buffet area being loft-like to the lounge area it seems a bit louder upstairs where ppl or are enjoying good food and conversation, of course. So if on a nice intimate date, pick the dining room. No doubt we will return on our next visit to Vegas.",

Then comes the food-all I can say is EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. The hush puppies with honey butter could be a meal in themselves, definitely should have asked for more. My boyfriend got jerk chicken and the sauce was so good! I got shrimp creole and again, amazing. We topped that off with a plate of beignets-you could easily split these between 6 people. Definitely a place to try and worth the wait if it's busy.",

And given how empty the place was, I guess we were the last to catch on!  It was awful from the moment we walked in!  My husband ordered an iced tea and said it was pure sugar, switching immediately to Coke.   Amazing how poor the service was, even surrounded by an empty restaurant. About 20 minutes after we sat down, (in an empty restaurant let me remind you,) the waitress dropped a bread basket and a plate with stale looking butter. Upon opening the napkin, we realized they withheld the bread and gave us hush puppies. After finally receiving bread, having asked for it, I realized why we didn't get it in the first place... It was warm at best when it arrived, and within minutes it was hard as a rock, revealing that it wasn't even remotely fresh, or good!  My husband got the tomahawk and said it was on par or below a famous Australian steakhouse chain!    My 2 lobster tails were rubbery and tasteless!  I even got one stuffed with crab cake and it was awful...    We even ordered the beignets, hoping to salvage the meal with sugar... Nope!  I think I took 2 bites and left the rest on the table!

And I have to say I will never be back it started off OK the place looks nice but then the weather does not like to listen to what you say so of course he got the mail wrong brought me the wrong entree.   Then he acts like it was my fault so then I get the right entree and the shrimp is raw and it's Fried shrimp.    So I let the manager know and they still charge me and he said sorry  for your experience.  With an arrogant attitude.  If you want bad service and nasty food this is the place for you.",

It was cold and bland . Really? I've been to NOLA and this is just a sad representation of their cuisine.  Mom got the NY steak which was ok with green beans.  Our server was horrible .. slow, inattentive, and just not good at his job .. serving isn't made for everyone \"Dr Bob\" .

    "text": "I guess you could call it our first official date PB (post-baby).  It was a last minute decision to check out Rhythm Kitchen on a Friday night, especially since we drive by it all the time and have to wonder what it's like.  We walked in to an elegant foyer and for a moment, I felt a bit under dressed.  There were two hostesses manning the front, one of whom I had the impression was the owner or manager.  With no reservations, we were easily seated at a table right by the pianist.  (They just added the pianist on a regular basis.)  It was really nice inside the dining room, and rather busy.  Despite the upscale feeling, there's a very casual crowd inside which works out great.  You can have a nice dinner out without the stuffiness.    Since we were on a time limit, we ordered only entrees and waited for them to arrive.  In the meantime, a basket of hush puppies and one bread roll with sweet butter arrived at our table.  (We are a party of two, only one bread roll?)  Nonetheless, we enjoyed the piping hot hush puppies and the warm bread.   There was a bit of lag time as we waited for our food and I was under the impression that it felt like it was a bit understaffed.  It looked like there were three waiters, which had me concerned with how long it would take our food to come out since the wait staff definitely took their time with each customer (getting drink orders, getting apps started, explaining items on the menu, etc.).  It gave us a chance to enjoy the lovely music though.    Our food did arrive by someone else and the Husband chose Seafeast Platter \"Combination of catfish fillets, oysters, fried shrimp and cold boiled shrimp.\" ($17.79) It came with one side, and he chose a Baked Potato with his.  He appreciated that it was loaded with butter, sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  The deep fried catfish and oysters were pretty good, and not overly oily or fatty.  It had a good batter on it.  His platter also came with their chow chow relish.  I chose the Grilled Cajun Scallops \"With andouille sausage.\" ($17.99)  It came with two sides, and I chose the Baked Potato and Sauteed Mushrooms.  The scallops were on a kabob stick (about 9 large scallops), along with sausage, bell peppers, and onions.  Rice and gravy sat underneath my protein.  The scallops were pretty good, not overcooked at all.  More on the rare side, which I prefer.  And the mushrooms were cooked very nicely too.  I pretty much devoured my dinner (as a customer noted from a nearby table).  This same customer also commented on how delicious her crab chowder and deep fried alligator was.  She even offered some to us!  Since we were in a rush, I quickly asked our waiter for our check and let him know we had a baby waiting.  He seemed like he understood our urgency, but took the time to clear our table first.  (Yes, I know he was doing his job, but I think he missed the point that we needed to go and now!)  The manager/owner took the time to talk to us and let us know about the bar/lounge connected next door and their happy hour.  She also mentioned that they have banquet facilities upstairs and there's a live band that will be coming on a regular basis as well.  (I think there's a cover charge.)  She also mentioned joining their email list so we could find out what entertainment was going on.  Overall, we both were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our experience at Rhythm Kitchen.  One would have a better experience if you can enjoy a leisurely dinner instead.  Yes, it might be a bit pricey depending on what you get, so it helps that they are in the Entertainment Book.",

I would hope not. the male manager that was on duty was very very kind & helpful, he seemed to make his way around the restaurant a lot always observing what's going on. I think the place is overpriced. and definitely over decorated as if they were a fine dining restaurant. if that's what they're going for? rhythm kitchen, the word kitchen makes it sound casual.  yes I would return for the crab legs for 35 bucks. other then that, I can't see driving across town again.",

I get it's a steakhouse, but every other steakhouse has at least ONE item that can be prepared. The waitress just said no and didn't offer up any suggestions, in fact that was her demeanor for any small request.  The service was incredibly slow. To top it off, the food was mediocre at best. We were expecting Cajun spices, etc..but it was all bland and boring. Needless to say we won't be returning.",

This is for the restaurant side as we didn't go to the lounge/bar side.  Dinner on a Tuesday night....  Service:   Great!  Jesse took really good care of us. Of course, the place was pretty empty and it was just us and a couple other tables.  Ambiance:  Nice.... White Table cloth kinda place but not stuffy... definitely can wear nice jeans to.  Menu:  Good selection of all different kinds of \"New Orleans\" type of food (crawfish, alligator, catfish) plus the usual fare like chicken and pasta dishes.  Taste:   Hushpuppies are AWESOME!  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside... and not grainy like most hushpuppies I've tried. Plus, these have  nice kick to them... I think there were pepper pieces in them.  Shrimp Broquette appetizer: nothing special.... the menu described it as being wrapped in bacon... but we didn't see any bacon... it came out like a Shrimp kabob on a skewer with bell peppers and onions on rice pilaf.  Jambalaya was pretty good... not the best I've ever had but meaty and filling.  The Crawfish Etoufe was ok... I've had better.... but the size of it... Wow!  I think this could easily be shared. And it was filled with lots and lots of crawfish which was really nice.  The Vegetarian Plate made a great side dish.  It's listed under Salads... but we ordered it as a side to our entrees... and it was pretty big and came with grilled asparagus, zucchini, steamed brocolli, mushrooms and rice pilaf.  Price: A little on the pricey side... I think for 3 people our total plus tip was $140.",

Once we were seated, it took 15 mins for them to bring us water (still no contact from the actual server). 30 mins sitting, the server finally came up and asked for the drinks. Our Drinks took approx 10 mins to get to us, oh and 40 mins in, we still have not ordered food or appetizers. The server delivered our drinks and finally took our appetizer order only. 60 mins sitting there... our appetizers came out and the runner who put them on the table, did not explain what anything was, just set them down. We had to track the server down to find out what was what on the appetizers. The server then took our order (60 mins after we sat down). Between when we ordered and when our food was delivered, we saw the server a total of 2 times... no refills on our drinks...we actually had to ask other servers for refills.  For the $300+ bill that we got for 4 people, this type of service in UNACCEPTABLE!  The food was amazing... hands down one of the best New Orleans style restaurant I have ever been too. It's too bad that the rest of our experience was not so great. Our servers name was Dr. John.",

    "text": "I have only dined at this restaurant three times. My first time, the service was good. That was over a year ago. Second time was sometime last year as well and I sat at the bar. Last night was my third time and service was really bad. My friend had sat there at around 6:10pm and no one came to take our order until about 6:25pm. Understandable that it was busy. When I came in, a little before happy hour ended, I added an order of chicken wings and a lemon drop martini. The wings came before the first part of the order. I was still waiting on my lemon drop. We waited about 20 minutes for the rest of the food we ordered. They also forgot one item we ordered. After 7pm, business slowed down. It was so chilly in the dining room too! I brought a sweater, but it still didn't help. After dinner, we went outside to enjoy some chicory coffee and beignets. Server came by a couple of times. It seemed like the service was mediocre everytime I go there, which is why I only go once a year. It's better to sit at the bar instead of at a table. You won't get ignored if you're front and center.",

    "text": "Based on previous reviews of poor service we dinned at the Rhythm Kitchen with trepidation. I drive by this place frequently and always say to myself, \"some day.\" Well last night was the night, we made a 6:00 reservation and arrived early, we were seating promptly by the hostess.  Our server Heather greeted us immediately with a wine menu. We choose 2 Tito's martinis with blue cheese olives instead. The martinis arrived in just a few minutes chilled to perfection.  We stared with an appetizer of Firecracker, which was Ahi Tuna with a spicy guacamole served with Won Ton chips. The presentation was lovely and so was each bite. My husband ordered the Shrimp Creole with a whole wheat pasta. (Love it when restaurants offer a whole wheat pasta.)  He also ordered a side of the mixed veggies. I had the Shrimp Fettucine. The Fettucine was very fresh tasting but a little bland for me, no problem as there was a very tasty, spicy sauce (bottled) on the table.  The entree my husband had was exquisite! Just the right amount of spice. Overall, we enjoyed the Rhythm Kitchen immensely. The decor, the music and cleanliness are something we always look for when dinning out. Our server, Heather was a superstar, very attentive and did not miss a beat! We would most definitely asked to be seated in her section on our return, which by the way will take place in the near future.",

    "text": "I love judging books by the cover....thats how I ended up tonight with my mom at the Rhythm Kitchen.  For months I have driven by this impressive edifice at Decatur and the 215 and wondered what kind of awesomeness went on inside.  It was clear from the facade there was some type of N'awlins food going on and with mamma's money paying the tab, I finally had an excuse to venture over.    I was immediately struck by the size of the place.  The lounge and bar area is big and almost completely separate from the rest of the restaurant.  The dining room is even bigger and nicely apportioned...Im a sucker for table clothes and they of course have them.  Smile.  The menu has many Creole specialties and is fairly expansive.  The wine menu is pretty average and I was disappointed to see that the wines by the glass were kind of pricey for the quality.  They did redeem themselves by having three types of beer from Abita in Louisiana on draught which were tasty.    A bread basket is brought out to start that has dinner rolls and............wait for it.........................HUSH PUPPIES!!!!!  I love hush puppies and these were excellent, not those janky fried mush balls you get at fast food fish places named after a pirate.  We also ordered one of their appetizers and got the Crab Cakes which came as three large crab balls.  They had a nice batter on the outside and rich, warm crab on the inside.  The remoulade sauce was a nice complement for them as well.    I ordered the Seafood Gumbo and my mom got the Shrimp Jumbalaya and both were generous servings with rice and, peppers and Andouille sausage.  The funny thing however was that there wasn't much difference between the two in terms of look and composition.  Strange.  I mean we were both happy and the taste was excellent but they were almost the same.  In fact, I might suggest getting the Gumbo because its significantly cheaper.  But yeah, the doppleganger effect was odd.     Overall prices are reasonable, service crisp and friendly and food pretty darn good.  They're not reinventing the wheel at Rhythm Kitchen but they are serving up decent New Orleans style cuisine.    Sometimes its best to leave a mystery a mystery because your not happy with what you find out and its better to dream about all the possibilities that could be.....thats not the case here.  I'm glad I made it into Rhythm Kitchen to explore and I'm sure I'll be back again.",

With that that being said,  the pluses were the alligator tail, it was succulent and delicious served southern style, and fried.  The drinks were great good but confussing happy hour schedule, sadly due to the rush I was never able to get my order of fried green tomatoes, thus I can't review them here.  I do intend on giving this place another try, to sample some of the more traditional dishes they have to offer.  It is a nice elegant atmosphere. this certainly was the right place to be on a fat Tuesday.",

    "text": "I agrees with Tricia M - that the food is very hit and miss but fortunately for me - mostly hits...  Hubby and I have been here twice now - once with the family and then a few weeks ago for date night with friends.  I am happy to report I am so glad we tried this place!  Thanks fellow Yelpers for steering me away from what this restaurant should be known for - NOLA deliciousness and instead have stuck to steaks and catfish.  I have not been disappointed.    Both times we have had the friendliest servers who waited on us hand and foot, even towards the end of our meal when the restaurant was full. The food was delicious as well and would have received a higher rating except the baked potatoes were beyond over cooked and cold.  Wasn't impressed with the desserts either - but maybe because I was too stuffed.  I also would have really loved to try the real Cajun cuisine instead - I was tempted but I knew better (thanks to Yelp!).   The steaks and other sides were amazing as well as our appetizers. Grilled Oysters - Yum!  Alligator - Yum!   Asparagus - Yum!  Grilled Mushrooms - Yum!  Catfish - moist and flakey huge Yum!  Hush Puppies -OMG Yum!  Hubby was not a fan of the seasoning used on the outside of his prime rib but that was a personal taste issue - the prime rib was still perfectly cooked. And they really know how to grill a ribeye (but my sexy hubby chef still is the master!)   We will definitely be back but I will Yelp first to see if the ratings have improved enough for me to try the Jambalya, Gumbo, Dirty Rice & Shrimp Creole that I really want.",

    "text": "Overall, the food is very hit and miss here.  What's really sad, is all the misses were the New Orleans (cajun/creole) food.  I'm not sure what the owners are doing here but they need to hire someone that has experience cooking food from Louisiana, because it is obvious they don't.  Service was very good.  This isn't an issue.    Food that was good was really good.  The hot wings come with one of the most delicious sauces I have tasted, made with Crystal.  These are breaded (a cardinal sin on hot wings), but so moist and delicious I didn't care.  The NY steak my husband ordered was cooked so well it could easily compete with the best steakhouses on the strip.  It was charred well on the outside, and delicious on the inside, as if they let it sit the perfect amount of time to keep the juices in the meat.  I wanted this dish much more than the one I ordered.  The bad food was really bad.  Unforgivably bad.  I ordered the fried oysters, one of my favorite dishes ever, and it was just breading and hardly no taste of the juicy oysters.  I think they chopped these up which horrified me.  I ordered some fresh steamed broccoli, and it was mushy and flavorless.  What a waste of good broccoli.  My husband had fries with his steak and it was the cheap, frozen steak fries you can get from Ellis Island or any of those other low cost places.    With a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate our food was about 38 bucks, and that included beer.  I am unsure if I would come here again, they would have to make some serious improvements on cooking some of the food before I will.  My husband still talks about how good the steak was so we may come back.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try this place since we drive by often.  We took advantage of the Valentines Pre-fix menu for $125 per couple.  When we first walked in we weren't greeted with an overly warm affection.  We were seated on the lower level and handed menu's when I had realized that my husband said that when he booked the reservation he was told we would be on the top floor. I asked the hostess , she said oh I didn't know!? Not my problem! We went upstairs and a nicer woman approached us , she asked about our preferences with our steak. I knew that our menu included champagne , but was expecting water at least before our food. That was not the case , we had our salads out before anything to drink . I quickly asked the server to please bring us some water. Hello!! I have previously been a waitress several years ago , and it was always a given to get beverages on the table before food! She then seemed a little annoyed and gave an excuse that she was just helping our server. ?? Our waiter was nice.  We started with Caesar salads and a sweet roll, both were good. Second course was crab cakes with Remoulade sauce. They were a little spicy  and tasty. They were playing a video DVD of John Mayer in concert , until a man with a keyboard started playing romantic tunes. Next it was time for our steak and lobster, my husband had to stop our waiter before we left to get us steak knives, hello!!! The meal was very good , it came with asparagus, and Savoyarde potato . Everything was pretty good. It was cooked very well and tasteful.  Dessert was yummy , a hazelnut crunch bar that was soft and melted in your mouth with a crunchy layer on the bottom. Overall it was a good experience , but for $125 a couple , I would have expected a bit more with regard to service.  We may give this place another shot , and sample their regular menu.?",

Also ordered the Cajun shrimp, it had what they call Cajun sauce, very plain, it lagged flavor, it was red water.  I have had the same dish at the Sunset station Oyster bar, and that one is so flavorful that you scrape up the bottom of your dish with the sourdough rolls.   Overall, a bit overpriced for what you get but i highly recomend the alligator tail.",

We also ordered the Crescent City Pasta , which had 0-0 seasoning,  presentation was gorgeous but taste fell waaaay short. Next, dessert my Mud Pie good but the Brownie ? was a hard brick of microwaved imperfection, even the server was shocked at how hard it was when we asked him to cut it..shhh my ice cream had ice chips and frost in it but i still finished it, so after the water was over poured and crashed in our laps we finished the evening off with a cocktail and a beer which somehow they managed to get right...we left thinking there couldn't possibly be anyone of Cajun/ Louisiana culture cooking in that kitchen....restaurant has great potential...but i need my potential with some Rhythm(aka: seasoning)",

Negatives Of four of us that ordered steaks I was the only one who didn't have to return mine.  We are all prior military and have eaten some crappy food so to actually return something means it was really, really not what we ordered or very bad. Hostess, sadly, was really clueless.  If only one of us had to return a dish I would have given them at least 3.5 stars.  My steak was good but we had a table of six people and only two were satisfied with their meal.

We were greeted by the friendly waiter that explained the happy hour menu. We started with cocktails. I got New Orleans drink of choice the Hurricane. This was my first time having one. Very fruity and easy drinking. Be warned however this drink is a creeper and you will be feeling happy in no time. We got the following from their happy hour menu. Charbroiled Oysters. Cooked to perfection, nicely melted butter and parmesan cheese with cajun spice broiled and hot. Delicious! Kobe beef sliders come 3 on a platter cooked medium rare with a side of mixed greens and red onion. Ahi poke was extremely fresh with a nice teriyaki glaze served with taro chips. Baby back ribs were smoky and nicely seasoned that fell off the bone served with a tangy bbq sauce and blackened alligator tail with a very nice sweet and spicy cocktail sauce. I wish we weren't so stuffed because there was a nice selection of scrumptious desserts we didn't get to try. If you're looking for a nice happy hour hangout, give Rhythm Kitchen a shot. Outstanding food and drinks at a decent price, very nice atmosphere with that NOLA vibe.  A special shoutout to the waitstaff who took care of everyone in a timely manner even as it started getting really busy. Great place!!",

I imediately felt the excitement in the building and couldn't wait to be seated..   As soon as we sat we were introduced to a helpful and happy server. She asked if it was our first time and immediately recommended dishes on the menu. One of them was the N'Awlins Seafood Delight which sounded so yummy..it was one of her favorites!   For appitizer we had the Big n Easy sampler, a variety of their fried items such as frog legs, crab cakes, aligator tail, and fried oysters!!! Wow it was amazing! Already a good start... Our server brought out hush puppies and homemade bread! Yum!   I ordered the seafood delight which was blacken catfish with grill shrimp topped with a Cajun Parmesan cheese serve with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli!! It was AMaZInG!! No wonder it was her favorite!   My friend ordered the prime rib with a house salad and their red beans n rice. I tried a piece and was blown away by all the season n spices it had.. Not to mention the size of the meat! Huge!! I asked our server how they prepared the prime? She was so helpful she explained that they season it well with salt n pepper, kitchen bouquet and red wine, then cooked for 6 hours!   I enjoyed every moment at Rhythm Kitchen from their staff to their delicious food! I will definetly be back for more and would highly recommend eating here! Next time I will try their banana fosters n creme brulee for dessert!!",

The portion was super small poke stack about quarter cup of poke. So the waiter Rob had such an attuitude and talked back to us. We checked in with yelp to get a free drink, and then he makes us feel bad for the free drink. When we got the bill we asked Rob to do separate bills, and he gave us one big bill...asked him once again to separate the bill, he walked off mad. Food was ok, service sucked. Rob you need to learn how to serve people. We at the group are all dealers if we had some good service we would of taken good care of you, but instead you choose to give us attitude. We will never come back bc of Rob. Let me add...2 guys came late and ordered beers that never arrived. Another guy in our party beer never arrived. Wasn't even busy, Rob should of been able to take care of that.",

    "text": "I have a new favorite restaurant!   Ever since I moved here I have been craving some good Cajun food, and after a disastrous attempt to find some at the Henderson Crawfish Festival, my boyfriend surprised me by bringing me to Rhythm Kitchen for my birthday. The sign fooled me at first, since it advertises itself from the outside as a typical steak and seafood place, but once I saw the menu I was really excited. Alligator tail! Frogs legs! Gumbo! Crawfish! I wasn't sure where to start.   After much consideration, we eventually settled on blackened alligator tail for an appetizer. Yum! The sauce on it definitely has a kick. The bread basket they bring out also has these tiny little hush puppies that have a little jalapeno in the batter for some flavor. Usually I think hush puppies are just bland fried corn meal balls that aren't even worth eating, but they manage to turn (what I think) is a bad food idea around and make theirs exciting.   For an entree, I went with the crawfish and catfish etouffee, and my boyfriend got a steak \"oscar style\" with a crab cake on top and covered in Bearnaise sauce. Both meals were amazing, and his also came with a side of yummy macaroni and cheese. Everything was well cooked, the sauces were amazing, and we were two happy customers.   We also got a couple of the deserts that also did not disappoint.   Besides the food, the atmosphere is really nice. The actual building is meant to look like an old southern plantation house. I read other yelp reviews complaining of the service, but our server was friendly, attentive, and was pretty knowledgeable about where the chef got their product. I also like that the bar is completely separated from the restaurant, and has its own happy hour menu. I would definitely like to stop in for a drink and a couple small plates at the bar sometime.   Overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had for awhile. I love Cajun food and was not disappointed. I will be coming back soon.",

My assumption was that it was a cajun/creole type of establishment which for me the food lacked both cajun and creole and seasoning in general. I had the crescent city pasta with the cajun alfredeaux sauce. The dish is essentially seafood pasta with alfredo sauce. The cajun alfredo is a joke. Its not cajun and its not even good alfredo. it was too thin and lacked flavor. The shrimp were small and the spinach was all clumped together. Overall it was a lackluster meal. I probably won't be back to rhythm kitchen.",

They both had a careless attitude had no knowledge or professionalism. One of the hostess said the manager was off..on the evening of Mothers Day?? This place was out of control! There were others who were waiting well over an hour and a half to be seated with reservations as well. I don't understand on your site it states to be prompt and not to miss your reservation, then why make a reservation if you still have to wait up to 2 hours to be seated. Once seated the place settings had food on them the glasses were dirty as well as the table. We waited 30 minutes to even be acknowledged, waited another hour and 10 minutes after our order was taken(still waiting on food)to be told the kitchen was out of baked potatoes I ordered. Other empty tables around us sat uncleared for long periods of time it. At one point the front hostess came back to clear the tables. It was obvious the customers were definitely a last concern. The service was terrible the food was cold, undercooked, and nothing to talk about. Out of the many restaurants I have been to on Mothers Day or any other day this was by far the worst experiences I have ever had and most definitely was my first and last to this restaurant.",

We arrive for our 7:15 reservation at 7pm and was told it would be a 20 min wait which was fine. 8:00 rolls around and we're still waiting. I ask the girl at the counter how long it would be and at first she said she didn't know because they were over booked and they had to wait for a large table and all this other nonsense so she then said it would be about another 20 mins I just said ok. 8:40 rolls around and we're STILL waiting at this point I'm PISSED and ask them again what is going on and of course they're still just waiting for a table and really can't tell me anything else. SO THEN the hostess girl leaves the podium to go talk on the phone at this point!!! We were over it and walked out! TERRIBLE customer service",

We had an outstanding waiter, who obviously has been with them for a while. Our food was delicious and the service impeccable. The next time, we obviously had a new waiter and the service was not good and the food was mediocre. Our third visit, we had another new waiter. It was Thanksgiving and the food was traditional and very good. The service was not. This could be an excellent place to eat, but they need to get it together.

    "text": "On each occasion that I've driven by this faux French Quarter building that rises out of the desert on an uninspired stretch of S. Decatur, I get nostalgic for the time I spent in New Orleans several years ago.  The food and the good times were epic, and I was not blinded with expectations that I would find anything like it here in Vegas.  My boyfriend bought a Group-on for this restaurant on the mention that I'd like to try it sometime.  I warn you that this review is projected through the rose-colored wine glasses of love, so grab a barf bag if you must.  We made a reservation for an early Friday dinner, but there were tables still open when we arrived.  The hostess attempted to seat us in an area of the dining room where the tables were occupied by families with children.  I was puzzled about that since there seemed to be lots of tables available and we were obviously a couple out for a romantic evening.  We were going to order a bottle or 2 of wine, we were going to have inappropriate conversation, we did not want this to occur in front of  children.  I gently advised her we would be more comfortable in that area where other child-less nuzzling couples were enjoying their wine & food.  She guided us to a more suitable table.  Our server was a bright-eyed gorgeous young thing who was impeccably turned out in a formal uniform (all the service here were in beautifully professional waitstaff suits).  She was very friendly & took our Group-on with a smile.  One thing that really impressed me was her knowledge of the wine list.  I required assistance choosing a wine so she asked me what kind of flavors I was looking for.  I told her I wanted something dry and citrusy, she recommended the Viognier which was the perfect choice.  And she stored it in a chilled wine bucket.  Fabulous!  Soon after came the bread basket.  I sampled only the hush-puppies which were crispy, dense, spicy & savory.  I detected a smoky pork flavor which drew my hands to the bread basket several more times. We ordered the blackened alligator to start with.  The blackened seasoning was perfect, perhaps a bit too salty.  I'm not the biggest fan of alligator's swampy flavor profile and sinewy texture, however I found the few bites I took enjoyable.    Boyfriend had the Atchafalaya crawfish delight, he subbed grilled asparagus for the vegetable medley for $2.  He was utterly delighted with his large portion of blackened catfish smothered in cajun rice and spicy etouffe.  I was all about the crawfish etouffe.  Our wonderful server suggested I add shrimp which gets them an extra star.  Crawfish butts are very small (I already knew this), so the addition of a few large shrimp pumped up the smooth, savory, spicy stew.  I noticed some strange things on the menu such as pizza & Caesar salad which seem to be placed there to add variety so that the menu will appeal to more people.  I found this move to be disagreeable but I understand it's financially smart to cater to different tastes.  Though who goes to a Cajun/Creole restaurant for pizza?  The bar adjoining the restaurant seemed pretty popular, their happy hour deal seems like a great way to enjoy the food & drinks for a lower price.   I know it's a long review, I wanted to give a counter response to the shorter reviews that declare that this place \"sucks\" or that they didn't meet expectations.  I would admit it's more in the category of Antoine's than the Commander's Palace.  It's also not a budget restaurant but it would be a wonderful place for a romantic date, as long as your hostess doesn't sit you around a bunch of screaming kids.",

The jazzy music and white linen table cloth were very upscale, the cajun pasta and fried combo was excellent. The catfish was the best I have had in Vegas, the fried oysters were not so good. Now the not so good part. If you come in early, they tend to seat you near the kitchen. The problem is that there is NO partition between the kitchen door and the nearby tables. The dark classy ambiance is ruined by the brights lights and sound of the door opening and closing. Next, when I ordered an iced tea, the waiter asked if I wanted a raspberry flavored tea, I said sure and even asked if I wanted it refilled. What he didn't tell me is that the tea was $6 as well as the $6 refill, twelve dollars for iced tea is a joke. I also took a cajun alligator to go, upon opening the container at home, I found the equivalent of 4 ounces of alligator kibbles and bits, almost felt ripped off. If not for the Groupon coupon, it would have been an over-priced mess, and yes, the service is terrible and slow.",

    "text": "First, let me just say that I've never been to the South so I can't really compare this food to the True Southern style. I'm only comparing it to the other restaurants here in Vegas.  Went there on a weekend for dinner around their opening time (5pm), there was only 2 tables in there. So we got seated right the way.  They bring you a basket of hush puppies right the way with sweet butter.... oh my...... move over the \"Hush Puppies\" restaurant... these are the best hush puppies I've had. They are not your typical fried corn meal batter. These are really flavorful and fill with some kind of stuffing and Jalapeno peppers. Nice intense flavor with a hint of spiciness. We had to get a refill of one more basket.  For starters we ordered Grilled Cajun Scallops as appetizer $10.29. They were really fresh and skewered with some vegetables and over some rice. But the Cajun flavor could be strong though.   For entrees we ordered the all you can eat fried catfish fillets for $13.95 and Jambalaya for $14.29  The fried catfish were really tasty, the batter was seasoned just right so it's very crispy and flavorful. And these fillets are big pieces, and it's a real piece of fillet, not the fake small pieces other restaurants usually serve. And it's all-you-can-eat.... for $13.95! Can't beat that. They will bring you two more pieces each time when you get a refill and it's really fast. I think catfish is one of their popular items so they always have fresh batch coming out.  The Jambalaya was OK, the Cajun flavor was not as strong on this. And not really spicy. Maybe that's why the have a bottle of Louisiana's Hot Sauce on each of the tables.  Really attentive and excellent service. The atmosphere is romantic and quiet.  They also have a bar on the other side. But if you want to enjoy a romantic atmosphere, sit on the restaurant side. They also have a balcony upstairs and it appears to be another bar/ party room with a stage. It was closed when we were there, but maybe you can book it for private parties.",

The Mac and cheese was average at best, the warm chicken for my salad was luke warm, and the Caesar salad was from a bag quality with what seemed to be packaged dressing. It was half off wine night which was nice and we did enjoy the wine. The waitress however was not at all knowledgeable about the wine. Dessert was also less than incredible, the strawberry shortcake was clearly a frozen pound cake and the bengets were also not worth trying. I gave this place a second chance because I had I groupon but it wasn't even worth that. I will not be returning unless its for a bottle of wine in the bar.",

I have been to their competitor, Lola's and I must say that I will never go back to Lola's I was so disappointed, obviously the locals don't know what Louisiana cooking was all about in that place  (oysters as big as my pinky nail, I actually laughed out loud). So, needless to say I was skeptical when I was invited by friends to go to this place. I was pleasantly surprised, the food was great, so good that I guess that I can be considered a regular. I go home to Louisiana every 6 months for 3 weeks, and this place holds me over till I get home. Too bad that Vegas is land locked and we are unable to obtain fresh, alive an hour ago seafood, but this place is as close as you can get. Only one suggestion, instead of elevator music, play some jazz!",

I liked both of them a lot. Not everyone has the same taste in beer. The bartenders there are very knowledgeable and will find something you like.  The main reason we went in was to try the oysters. They were great, much better than the ones you find in local casinos or buffets. Also had the fried calamari, very crispy and delicious.   Next time I'll try the alligator tail and have a full meal.",

    "text": "Well James (waiter), you begged us to leave a review. so here it is.  I've lived in LV for 22 years now, and was a gambler in the 90's.  That said, I have been to numerous fine dinning establishments and have had a wide variety of experiences.  But what happened to us at Rhythm Kitchen on 7.13.17 was THE WORST WAITER I have ever encountered or had to endure !!  My wife and I go to Rhythm Kitchen a couple of times per year, love the food and you have the biggest juiciest Oysters on the half shell in town !!  We have also made a tradition of going here every year for my wifes' Birthday with her children, who live in Indiana, and fly out for her BDay each year.  This year her 17 year old son was the only one who was able to join us, and he was very excited to take US out for dinner on her Bday.  He saved his money especially for this dinner.  We had a 5pm reservation and were promptly seated.  From there it spiraled downward horribly.  Our waiter, JAMES, was beyond rude, and worthless. As we watched the only other 3 tables receive decent service from James, he seemed to ignore us purposely.  Not sure why either. He never gave us bread or Hush Puppies.  So I asked for bread and received Hush Puppies only.  Asked for bread again and didn't get any until I flagged down a runner.  Also, we had to ask three times for extra lemon for our dozen Oysters that came with one lemon wedge. Wait, it gets FAR WORSE. My wifes son, excused himself from our table to inform James that it was his moms Birthday and asked if the staff could sing Happy Birthday to her. What happened next left me speechless !!  James was also training a new waiter, can not remember his name as we were never introduced to him, and we watched as he tried to keep up with his horrible trainer.  He was an ex military looking gentlemen from Pittsburg, we learned later.  This trainee was awesome, too bad he was being trained by an ass !!  Image my surprise when James and his trainee come to our table with 2 desserts that we ordered, and says \" We're gonna sing Happy Birthday to you now, but I DON\"T sing so my trainee is gonna lead and you two (myself and Blake) are going to have to jump in \"  WTF is THAT?!?!!  I don't sing ??  Really. Either do I !!  WOW  !!  Are you listening management or owners ??   JAMES DOESN\"T SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY !! Who does that in fine dinning ??  I was ready to go off on the entire place but reluctantly sat there speechless instead.  So, as Blake was going to pay the bill he asked me how much of a tip he should leave on a $154 bill?  My reply....Did you get good service ?  Tip accordingly.   I was beyond delighted to hear that Blake deemed James' service to be worth $6 !!!   LMAO, great move son !!   For the record, my wife is in the service industry and we are locals who OVER tip regularly !!   So, as I started off saying, James had the audacity to grovel to us to leave him a great review on Yelp, because it makes him look good to management. HaHaHa you asked for a review, you got one.  If management cares to fact check my review, I think I've made it abundantly clear, but here are THE EXACT DETAILS :  July 13, 2017, 5 pm reservation for 4 only 3 of us made it,  dinner and appetizers plus one glass of house Chardonnay $154, gratuity $6, waiter JAMES who was training a new guy from Pittsburg ( very pleasant ).  Thanks for the memories Rhythm Kitchen ... :(   Time for us to start a new tradition for my wife's Birthday !!",

And any Cajun/Creole person who was lucky enough to try my grandmother's gumbo all said the same thing:  It was the best they ever had. So I am VERY critical when it comes to Cajun/Creole food, because I know it.  The place itself is nice. Service just ok. Staff was friendly enough, but I got gumbo without a spoon. Got one about 10 mins later after waving down our server. I would have an empty water glass for several minutes, and again would have to flag down our server for these things, as it seemed every time he walked by he was looking at something in the far off distance. Maybe wishing he was anywhere else.   Now the food. Fried Crawfish Tails, pretty good. Hushpuppies were fine. Gumbo, just no. No. My husband got the Rhythm Kitchen Platter which was ok. I got the Catfish and Shrimp Creole, which didn't really impress me. The bread pudding was bad.",

    "text": "The restaurant has a great atmosphere and air of Louisiana; however the Southern hospitality was missing. I went on a Friday evening with a party of 4, so the place was just beginning to fill when I arrived. I totally understand the culture of Las Vegas does not lend itself towards hospitality or courtesy, but when you attempt to have a Southern style restaurant, you need to take the expectations of your clientele into consideration.   Aside from the lack of hospitality, the food was good and had great presentation. I am vegetarian, so there is not much to choose from. I had the Garden District Spinach Salad with no bacon or egg. The full sized salad was a nice dinner portion, but I probably could have gotten away with the half after eating bread and hushpuppies. The Hushpuppies had a nice amount of spice with good texture.   The best part of this restaurant was the beignets. Your order will arrive with 3 fluffy beignets, fried to perfection, with just the right amount of powdered sugar to require full usage of your napkin. If I go back, I could easily get an order of beignets to go and be a happy camper!",

They brought me a Cesar salad and when I told the server it wasn't what I ordered, he said he was sorry and would bring back what I ordered.  I never again saw my salad.  Everyone got their order except me.  They were almost done by the time I got my order. The food was nothing extraordinary and the lobster didn't seem like it was fully cooked.  My husband didn't get his shrimp/crab cocktail and finally got it with his meal.  Uhh, appetizer? When I finally got the check I noticed they charged me for the salad I did not receive. When I mentioned it to our \"server\" (and I use the term loosely) he said he would take care of it.  At no point did I see the credit for the salad.  When I checked my credit card bill, guess what?  No credit for the salad. Since the party was so large, gratuity was added to each bill.  Too bad.  The service was unacceptable and the food was nothing to write home about.  Like I said NEVER, NEVER again!",

Of the New Orleans style cuisine I have sampled here in town over the years, this is the closest I have found to the real deal!  The Crawfish Etouffe is delicious, the spinach artichoke dip with crawfish is really tasty and I have also had a fantastic prime rib.  Additionally, I have sampled a friend's shrimp pasta and several of the fried appetizers - the appetizers were nothing special, but the shrimp dish had great flavor!    Aside from the food, though, Rhythm Kitchen offers many different wines and specialty mixed drinks, including some classics like the Sazerac.  The classy atmosphere feels like fine dining, but the prices are quite reasonable, especially during happy hour.  This is a great place to take loved ones for special occasions.  The first time I dined here the wait staff was very sparse and it took a very long time to get drinks and eventually get our food.  But each time I've been back the service has improved and the food has always been good enough to keep coming back regardless.",

Considering the alternative was Millers Ale House (no thank you) I agreed to give it a try. The appearances of the front entrance are deceiving- this place was much fancier than either of us anticipated. Thankfully, I make it a habit to shower and wear make up whenever I actually make it out of the house so I felt comfortable there but my friend was in a baseball cap. It wasn't until I pointed out a dude in a windbreaker jump suit that he was able to relax.  Their drink menu is almost as big if not bigger than the food menu (which I greatly appreciate) and I settled on the wine flight. $13 for 3 glasses of 2 oz of wines that I got to choose. They were all delicious.   Our server was friendly if not a little too robotic Stepford Wives for me- but her enthusiasm was appreciated. Upon asking what her favorite dishes were, she pointed out all of the ones I could never eat- fried, laden with lactose or chock full of gluten. As soon as I confirmed that the 'Shrimp Creole' was tomato based and that spinach could be substituted for the rice, I was happy..even if she made a face at my modification. (Don't feel bad for me- I'm used to it).  A basket of hush puppies were brought to the table automatically and my friend devoured all of them- so I assume they are good! The food itself didn't take long and the shrimp dish I got was delightful. Yum, yum, yum.  Best part- my friend treated ME!   I will definitely be recommending Rhythm Kitchen but not sure I all return often- they need just a few more healthy (ish) dishes please!",

We dined on 6/26/14 at 9pm We had our same waiter from all of our previous visits. The one that goes by Dr. Bob Always a great waiter. Very friendly and great to talk to.  This time around we got freshly made, just out of the deep fryer hush puppies. The waiter also brought us out a brand new bread that the cook had made. The waiter mentioned it was probably a sour dough of some type. Whatever it was, it was really good. And since the owner frequently checks all of the Yelp reviews, I would like him to note that this new type of bread is very welcome in future visits.  I once again had the blackened chicken pasta, which is always a great dish. Chicken cook perfectly and great pasta with the Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.  My friend had his usual favorite, the filet mignon. The waiter made sure that the filet was cooked perfectly and that it had it's proper rest period before serving (5mins)  Just another fantastic dining experience. More people need to try out Rhythm Kitchen.",

He's a really good Waiter. Other than that we were not that happy with this place. They do have amazing alcohol selections and \"speciality\" drinks. We started off with 2 of those and they were fun and tasty plus we used our buy 1 get 1 free with our yelp check in. We then got some rolls and hush puppies with honey butter for the rolls. The rolls are straight up Hawaiian sweet rolls you buy at the grocery store and the honey butter was ay okay. The hush puppies were good my husband said (I've never been a fan) then we got our appetizer that came with several southern fried items. Crab cakes, alligator, oysters, and frog legs. We were not impressed at all. The crab cakes flavor was over powering, I couldn't put my finger on it but it wasn't good. The other three didn't have any flavor at all!!! Yes the sauces were good that came with them but the meat itself were bland. Then my husband ordered a steak with a baked potato and broccoli, the broccoli had strong garlic pieces all over and it was so overwhelming, but his steak was eh. I got the blackened lobster tail Alfredo, this was okay except the sauce came out like water and tasted like a jar of Ragu Alfredo sauce from the grocery store. I wasn't too impressed but the lobster tail was okay except how rubbery it was. We got a bread pudding to go and paid our bill which was about $140, not worth it to me but oh well. I've been home the past hour now and can't stop going to the bathroom and when we left the restaurant I told my husband I don't feel good. Not sure if it's food poising or not but it must of been something I ate but my husband feels fine. I'm thinking it could have been the lobster. Overall we will not come back to this place, and it's such a shame because it's so beautiful!",

While this could perhaps be tolerated despite the price hikes, the vibe of our waitress was more off putting and will likely decide that this was our last visit.  Service was polite but thrice we got the insinuation that we should be done eating.  The final one being her asking to take our plates with no inquiry as to if we were finished eating.  Rushed service coupled with declining value means this spot has lost its rhythm.",

The second visit was a busy Saturday night with just my wife. The service both times was very good - thank you James from TX for taking care of my wife and me.   The problem with Rhythm is their menu and specials all look so incredible, it is very hard to decide what to eat. Both times the food was fantastic and everyone enjoyed their food immensely. However, my youngest son was off put by the frog legs - something about his experience in science class. They have a great wine list. I really enjoyed the wine and afterwards tried to find the red blend called \"Troublemaker\" at the local liquor store.  This will be a regular stop for me and a place to bring guests or refer business connections to. It impresses in food, service, and decor. Last but definitely not least - don't leave without having either the beignets or the key lime pie with coffee. I'm always looking for that Cafe Du Monde beignet experience and Rhythm comes very close.",

We picked RK because we have both wanted to try it and because it is right down the street from our office.  I really like the way the restaurant is set up and feels like a southern home. Our server was friendly and brought our order quickly. We had some drinks and fried food which was good. The restaurant seems like fine dining based on the decor, but the menu and plating of the food does not. I'm not sure how I feel about the cost of the food either, $18 for chicken fingers and a baked potato is kind of high. Might try again in the future, however.",

Lou brought effortless class and debonair professionalism to the evening. Ask for him if you eat here. Most enjoyable!",

    "text": "From the Bayou to Las Vegas. Alligator is an appetizer on the menu at the Rhythm Kitchen that you won't find on any other menu in town. Service was great, the food was good, and the atmosphere was elegant.  Although I was anxious to try the alligator, I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor that seasoned the alligator bites. It was good, just nothing amazing. With your meal, the restaurant serves hush puppies and soft butter. I haven't had hush puppies in years, and I don't recall them ever being anything special. At Rhythm Kitchen, the hush puppies were really good.  It was all you can eat baby back rib night, which was the reason for our visit. I loved the tender ribs, but should caution that the chef packs on the rib sauce. I had to ask for my next round to come \"lightly sauced,\" and even lightly sauced was too much to handle. Getting more ribs upon request though was absolutely no issue. The turnaround was within 4 minutes. This is great! The ribs were meaty and tender.   The entree came with a loaded potato with green beans. The loaded potato has butter, sour cream, chives, and cheddar cheese. No complaints there. The green beans were good, but they are not made al dente, which is how I like my vegetables. The garnish for the entire plate is chives.  From the bar, I ordered the Hurricane. It was very good with my meal. For dessert, I was anxious to try the bread pudding topped with vanilla sauce. I have had great bread pudding experiences; at Rhythm Kitchen the bread pudding is missing something. It was not as moist  as it looked, and therefore required an extra helping of vanilla sauce to get it down. The vanilla sauce was very good.  I enjoyed the experience. I loved the atmosphere and the company. The restaurant was clean and comfortable.",

It wasn't very busy at all from the looks of it. We were seated promptly and brought water but then the waiting began. It took a while to receive the wine we ordered but then were told they were out of stock of the one requested so the manager made another recommendation, Notorious Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a great recommendation. The first problem was the waiting. Salad and oysters on the half shell took a good 35 minutes to come out. Then it took another 45 minutes for our meal to come out and when it did come out it was lukewarm. I'm guessing it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a bit because the rice was a bit dried up too. The oysters were super bland as if they had soaked it in water too long and the crawfish etouffee just wasn't the flavor that I craved. The truffle Mac and cheese was more creamy than cheesy and was missing something. The cashew vinaigrette salad was wonderful though.  With all the waiting and the mostly disappointing food I can't give this place a good review. Yes, the server was nice and knowledgeable and the salad was good but I can't think of anything else that I liked.   I love Cajun food and wanted to find a good Cajun restaurant in Las Vegas but this wasn't the place for me.",

I forgot to write my review after our visit.  We made reservations, were greeted by a very nice hostess, sat us at a table for two near the window. There were about 3 tables already sat when we got there....so it wasn't very busy at all.  Our waiter came by, quickly, asked if we wanted any drinks...we both were parched and just wanted water.  I think since we only ordered water the waiter wasn't very happy.. we were then greeted by an amazing spirited waitress.  She said she was in training, I wish I had got her name, but she was NOT new to this industry. She was wonderful, attentive, she told us about the specials, which the other waiter did not, he asked if we had any questions about the menu, but never mentioned specials.  We both ordered 2 of the specials. I had the Lobster dinner special and my man had the steak special.  The dinners were great. My lobster was cooked to perfection.  My man said his steak was delicious.  Our waitress was very attentive, made us feel very at home. She convinced us to save room for dessert. She said she wanted to try here skills at the table side flambe...so we opted for the strawberry Flambe that came with shortbread and ice cream. We told her we would only order if she did it for us. The other waiter kept coming by and trying to be attentive but she had beat him every time. He ran around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He was so distracting.   By the time our dinner was done there were only about 6 tables filled and that waiter was still a mess.  The waitress we had...will make us come back, had he waited on us, we would not want to go back. It was a good dinner but for the price I do not think we would go back had we had the waiter. For us it is the entire experience of somewhere that would make us go back. Luckily we had the waitress we did....awwww....her name was Ariel!!!! I finally remember. She said it was like the little mermaid! :)  The only other thing I wish this place had was the great music coming from the bar was piped in low in the restaurant side as well.",

We finished with bread pudding and a 40 year port, which you can't  get just anywhere. Rhythm is a unique dining experience with great food and a great atmosphere.  Give it a shot.",

Our waiter was awesome and the food was most definitely delicious!! I've never had authentic southern food, and now I'm hooked for life! The collard greens were my favorite, the blackened catfish a very close second. We spent quite a bit more than we intended, the menu items are a bit pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. We will definitely be visiting again very soon!!",

I had some left over and it was just as great when I reheated it. The second time I had the Alaskan Snow Crab. I enjoyed every bite and had no leftovers. We ordered the Bananas Foster and each of us had a bite or two. It was wonderful and I recommend it. Of you want a yummy cocktail, give the Mardi Gras Punch or the Bayou Belle a try.

The waiter forgot to bring us bread, when we mentioned it he brought us some rolls with sweet butter which was really good and gave us some hush puppies which were ok.

All were delicious, and the bread they bring to the table is fantastic as well.  I ordered the blackened lobster fettuccine with a strawberry lemonade and both were insanely good! I loved the lemonade so much I could barely stop drinking it.  The entree was rich with flavor and it was quite a large portion. I could have shared it with someone and been plenty satisfied.   I highly recommend the strawberry Madagascar for dessert. It is fun to watch them make and it is so very good! Oh and service was pretty good as well. The only reason I did not give 5 starts is because something I ate made me pretty sick. My guess is the oysters but I can't be sure. I would go again just maybe not get the oysters.",

But one, get one free (dangerous, cause they're huge). Well worth the check in.  The drinks were great, the food was good, and our server was the most professional and kind gentleman we were sat with.  We had just a bit of everything. And just a bit of everything was good. The buzz I got from my first drink made it taste that much better.  We had the appetizer sampler, the chef special lobster pasta, and a steak.  Everything was tasty.  I'm a fan.",

    "text": "This restaurant is most assuredly a 4+ A fine dinning experience at an affordable price. I had the blackened alligator, Louisiana seafood gumbo, the tomahawk ribeye steak accompanied by mashed potatoes and green beans. The seafood gumbo was amazing.  You really could taste the seafood that was used. The alligator, I should have went with the fried instead of the blackened.  You could not taste the alligator with the blackening spices.  That was my unfortunate choice.   Additionally, the blackening technique used for the alligator fell short.  There was no crust on the alligator.  Blackening is an art and it is much more then the spices used.    At first, I wanted to change the mashed potatoes for red beans and rice.  Thankfully, I did not do this.  The mashed potatoes were amazing. The Veg that was used were green beans.  While good, I felt that they were lost on the plate with the steak and mashed potatoes. Now, for the prime, tomahawk ribeye.  This is definitely one of the best steak that I have ever had.  Incredible.  Tender.  Tasty.    I thought that Chicago had the best steaks.  Today, I have been proven wrong.  With the steaks, you can get them Oscar style.  Oscar - lump crap in a bearnaise sauce ladled over the steak.  The sauce was small in portion, cold, and just O.K. in flavor.  I felt it was an actual distraction from the steak itself.   Comment : Instead of serving the steak, green beans and mashed potatoes on one plate, each food item should be severed on a separate dish to elevate food presentation.   The service itself was very good - Spot on.  With all that I had, Coffee, gumbo, mashed potatoes, alligator and the prime tomahawk steak, my bill only came to $98.    Finally, I wish to do a shout-out to my waitress Lydia.  Thank your for your patience and great service !  Will I go back -  Yes.  I am looking forward to it !",

I ordered the Fried oysters (10) with fries and cole slaw, fried shrimp with fries and chow chow relish, and a order of fried catfish with fries and cole slaw. All plates came with hush puppies.  The good: the French fries were really good, but they give small portions.  Bad: the hush puppies were extremely over cooked, burnt, we were unable to eat them, the fish had a strong \"fishy\" taste, the oysters were ok, but they were too salty. The shrimp were ok, but nothing better than you would find on your local grocers frozen food aisle.  The cole slaw was not edible, nor was the chow chow.  The server placed the cold chow chow and cole slaw in the same container with the burnt hush puppies. So our hush puppies were burnt yet cold.  None of the food was warm.  We had such high expectations that the food would at least be decent. I will never order take out from this restaurant again.",

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Southern/Creole/Cajun food and we've been on this adventure to search for some good NOLA-style food here in the desert. We've actually already found it, unfortunately, it wasn't here.   Customer service was top notch. Atmosphere was great, except the low lighting, that was horrendous. Christina, our server, was great. Here's the reason for the 2-Stars...   As soon as I walked into the building, I was pretty impressed at the staircase leading to the second floor. It's a fine dining establishment and the decor is nice.   Although I haven't actually been to NOLA, I've set the bar pretty high for NOLA style food because it's sooooooooooooooooo good!   I like good food and I love it when I find a place is able to WOW me enough to get me to come back for repeat visits. Unfortunately, Rhythm Kitchen fell short of making any kind of impression on me. Their food is quite forgettable, the food wasn't up to par with what I've experienced else where. Again, I haven't been to NOLA, I will be visiting in Aug, so I am hoping that this is not the way the food really tastes because this was so disappointing.   I really doubt that I'll be back...

    "text": "I'm from Michigan and recently got married in Las Vegas, a friend referred RK to us for our after wedding dinner and said we'd enjoy it - that was an understatement! I worked with Arabella prior to the wedding and she was great at assisting me with the menu and answering any questions I had quickly.  She was very professional and made me feel at ease.  When our party arrived we were promptly seated in a beautiful dining area, orders were taken quickly and the food brought just as quickly.  The entire staff was very friendly and courteous.  The food was exceptional - appetizer was a Shrimp Brochette which I could've eaten as my entree, the Shrimp Scampi was great along with the Jambalaya.  I had the chicken and it was excellent.  All of my guests raved about the great food and service.  I would recommend this location for a great dinner or lunch and also for any type of event you may be having.  I was very happy with my choice and if I lived in Nevada I would frequent RK - too bad they don't have any in Michigan!  Thank you RK for everything!!!",

    "text": "First time there and it was a weird experience, seriously! We were seated quickly and introduced to our waitress as we were told it was her 2nd day on the job. We ordered calamari as an appetizer, small salads and our entrees all at once and requested that no food should be spicy. The hush puppies had no taste other than jalapenos... hello no spicy? We asked for more bread but please no more hush puppies and we get another basket of hush puppies...? what? the more experienced waiter/ supervisor spent most of his time talking to the 5-6 tables with diners about their special \"Injected\" turkeys they will be serving for thanksgiving. I mean this guy spent a lot of time describing to diners how they \"inject\" their turkeys in preparation steps before cooking...??? They bring the entrees and one of them is wrong....I hate sending things back but...anyways it comes back wrong again... forget it! I ate it that way.. too fearful of sending it back again and having who knows what happen to my food. The gumbo was tasteless, the \"garlic breadbowl\" the gumbo was supposed to come in was just a plain bread bowl? the jambalaya was good... but nothing to impress. The caesar was good, the bread in the basket was good. Water was constantly being refilled which was good.  It seems the food is hit or miss but the service is attentive and at the same time clueless... it seems everyone is either new or all their waitstaff are in a daze... from not paying attention to bringing food to the wrong table...to forgetting part of your order ..like \"the sides\".. The check comes and there's 18% added to the bill for a party of 2.... yeah groupon terms for the deal... but I always tip well, so it was what it was but they did not earn 18%  I would not waste my time and money.... even with a groupon!",

I thought the fresh baked rolls along with the hush puppies is a great way to get the munchies going.  First visit: I ended up getting the craw fish etouffe and fried crawfish. Both are extremely delicious. My GF also go the same. Our server was more than generous and helpful in her way of discussing the dishes and making recommendations.  Second visit: Our server was so bad. She filled the water once. She also gave us very little honey butter and dinner rolls (I asked for more, but she did not deliver). Also, we were promised hush puppies because the chef forgot to bake them, but nothing... This was the start.  Luckily, the entrees were pretty delicious. I got craw fish etouffe again because of how delicious it was last time.  My GF got this fresh fish (I forgot the name) and the NY steak, medium rare (for me). The steak was great!!! It was definitely of USDA choice quality.  I suggest coming here, but be very weary of certain servers. Some seem lazy or just incompetent.",

    "text": "After dropping off my car for repairs, we ended up in a conundrum for what to do about dinner.. only clue we had was a Cajun craving that hubby was suffering from.  So... I agreed to try Rhythm Kitchen, which hubby had visited for lunch once before and enjoyed.  We were promptly seated, the waitress was friendly and timely, and the food started.  First, the bread basket.. personally, I'm not a fan of biscuits and I'm not sure how they made those rolls out of biscuit dough but I'll admit the honey butter was a nice touch.  I'm also not a fan of hush puppies but Hubby declared them \"fantastic\" and he scarfed them down happily when I said they were all his.  Perhaps I should note that Hubby is from the south while I'm a born & bred Yankee.  He thinks spicy is a condiment while I prefer to actually taste the food itself ;)  Then, his appetizer arrived - some oyster thing that I don't recall the name of.  He loved it, which is good because he had six of them to eat.  I can't eat oysters, so I happily let him have them all.  Our entrees arrived promptly, and that's when things got really good for me.  Mine was called Crescent City Pasta, and it was basically a seafood fettucine alfredo with cajun spices.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, the sauce was well balanced - and obviously freshly made, which totally impressed me.  There was a lot of crawfish, shrimp, spinach & mushrooms.. and two scallops, which would have made me laugh but the dish was excellent.  The textures, flavor balance, and freshness of it all just melded together into a great pasta dish that I will definitely return for.  Oh, and Hubby's dinner - Crawfish Etouffee.  I tried a taste, it was definitely good - though a much stronger tasting dish than I was in the mood for.  He, however, loved it and managed some serious damage to it - despite having eaten all those hush puppies and oysters already.  But, we both had a lot to take home also - it'll be another Cajun night tonight =D  Oh, and our waitress Tawny.. sweet girl, fantastic timing, and almost psychic on her arrivals to the table, whether to just check on us or to replace a soda.  Only thing I would change is their \"DJ\" on their music tape that hawks Louisiana food between the music tracks.  They don't need to push the food, the people are already there for it.",

And why, yes, we WOULD like an appetizer plate too!  The appetizers come out and are seasoned nice and tasty. A first for frog legs for her. I've had them before. Wifey was not too impressed. She did like the rest of the platter though. (As did I)  Rib-eyes come out. Huzzah! Big problem. Steaks weren't seasoned at all. AND the waiter seems busy (dunno why, restaurant isn't yet.). The sides were ok, we've both had a couple of bites of steak and secede we're done.   Server comes back, asking if we wanted doggy bags. Nope.....kinda the worst tasting rib-eyes we've had. Surprisingly, he took the Borg straight off the bill, even though we didn't ask.   If you want a rib-eye and you are in THAT area.....just go down to McMullans Irish pub. Almost never disappointed with their food.",

    "text": "So the response I receive from Scott G of Rhythm Kitchen is; \"Hi Shawn, Unfortunately it's our policy to ONLY accept one offer  at a time. It's posted with our 1/2 off wine that it CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal. In addition, your Living Social deal also stated CAN NOT be combined with any other offer/deal.  We do remember when you were here - and you had a Groupon you tried to use in addition to the Living Social and 1/2 wine special.  We apologize for any confusion you my have experienced - however if you use Groupons/Living Social deals often it's standard that the deals can NOT be combined with any other offer.  Hope this helps!\"  The funny thing about this response is that I didn't have a groupon that I was trying to use and YES people I understand NOW that their policy doesn't allow the use of two or more offers.  However when one is told in the beginning of their dinner by someone that is representing such policies that you could get 1/2 price bottle of wine after they knew of living social, combo that with it being my first time there and trusting the server to guide me.  I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED THE WINE IF I WERE NOT TOLD THAT I COULD GET IT 1/2 PRICE!!!  The \"lady\" that came to the table even said the server was wrong and he will never make that mistake again.  Great so fix it ma'am and stop saying its my fault.  As I said to Scott G to his response if I ever received a response it would be the caliber it is..  Lame.    Also I didn't experience any confusion just embarrassment for me and my guest with being told the police were going to be called and being rudely spoken to by that \"lady\" manager.    Again if you are considering dining here, I highly suggest you reconsider.",

    "text": "We were a party of six, arrived at the restaurant a little before opening, so we had a little wait to be seated, which was understandable. Our server was OK, he took our orders for drinks and food reasonably well, however, the food took FOREVER to be delivered, and then it was below average and cold. It tasted like it had been cooked a week ago, and reheated, so why the long wait? We even ordered dessert, while we were eating the main course, so we wouldn't have to wait another hour for that too! It was a HUGE mistake. So here goes: don't order fried crawfish, they taste like rubber nuggets deep fried, no flavor. The seafood gumbo is average, you can tell there are shreds of seafood in there, but you can't tell WHAT it is. Bland seasoning, we had to ask for Tabasco to give it a kick. The only sauce with any flavor was the etouffee. The Jambalaya was the worst, according to the person who had it, the chicken was dry, the shrimp was extremely overcooked, mushy, and the rice tasted like it was cooked two weeks ago and reheated. Now for the dessert: if you've EVER had beignets  either in New Orleans or anywhere else for that matter, DO NOT ORDER THEM HERE! They're inedible, 3 HUGE rectangles of fried dough (it's supposed to rise - it didn't) dense and salty, then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Just AWFUL! The bread pudding with bourbon sauce had no sauce, it was dry and tasteless. The only decent dessert was the Key lime pie. We were there for what seemed like an eternity and had below average food, so in spite of the New Orleans feel of the decor and the music, I'm afraid we're not going back again!",

It's a bucket list item for locals and travelers alike!!!",

    "text": "First, I have to say that I'm confused by the number of negative reviews. Maybe we just happened to choose all of the best dishes, but we loved the food. I'm glad that we went a little out of our way to try this place. The restaurant was much nicer than I had expected since I thought it would be very casual, but none of the other diners was dressed overly formal.  To start, I was impressed by the bread basket. The hushpuppies in the bread basket were a nice touch and very good.  We had the cajun grilled scallop appetizer and I couldn't believe that an appetizer had such a generous portion. The scallops were perfectly prepared and the other flavors on the skewer and in the rice made for a great tasting dish overall. The appetizer was almost generous enough to be a light meal.   For my entree I had the shrimp creole which was very flavorful and had plenty of large shrimp. The spice was just the right amount that didn't overwhelm the flavor. My husband had the catfish with red beans and rice. The red beans and rice were quite yummy. The catfish was good, but it is definitely lighter than the heavily fried catfish most people are probably familiar with.  To finish the meal we had the key lime pie and fried ice cream. The key lime pie had a nice tangy lime taste with a buttery graham crust. It was almost as good as the key lime pie I make. The fried ice cream was good and chocolatey.",

The hostess is a jerk, we came in on a Saturday night and she treated us like we were peasants. Even though the parking lot, and the restaurant were dead.   With two children at home for the night we were excited for a night out, but our \"date night\" was ruined by this restaurant.    Hostess was rude, and our bread basket was literally Kings Hawaiian rolls. Which, we love when we are not expecting True NOLA cuisine. Further, my husbands drink, a Sazerac, was served in a Martini glass and obviously made with Galleano and not Absinthe.   Regardless their food was delicious until we got home and found a gnarly hair in our food. I am blonde and husband is bald, so this is definitely not ours.   Tips to mgmt: ditch the rude hostess, train your bartenders and get the hair out of the food.",

I asked the server about the alligator because the menu had it available both blackened and breaded.  She explained how each was prepared and then said that I could get half of each.  That's what I ordered.  My wife ordered the chicken with pasta in cream sauce.  We did not have any starters.  Our iced tea was brought quickly and a basket with hush puppies and two rolls was brought.  The butter for me was awful.  It was honey butter.  Maybe it's a southern thing.  I like salted butter and this was just too sweet for me.  It was also hard as a rock from being kept in a very cold refrigerator/freezer another hang up I have.  Our meals came and I totally enjoyed the alligator.  If I got it again, I'd definitely get half of each.  It really is good.  There was a nice dipping sauce that came with the dish and the alligator had a spicy flavor.  My wife liked her pasta.  It was tri-color withe a Southern style Cajun Alfredeaux sauce.  I think the sauce was a bit off putting for her.  We had dessert.  I had the Mississippi mud pie and my wife had the creme brulee.  My mud pie was mostly icy chocolate ice cream--something I wouldn't get again.  My wife really enjoyed her brulee.  Service became an issue before and after dessert.  The place got busy and it didn't seem like the staff could keep their acts together.  I had a show to go to and I made the reservation for 5:15 which would give me a good cushion for dinner with time to get home and get ready to go to the show.  It took so long to get the bill and then pay it that my cushion of time disappeared.  I had to hurry to get my wife home and then get to the theatre.  Plan accordingly.",

You are served 3 strips initially, but can get more since it is all you can eat. When you get more fish, you only get 2 pieces at a time. Finally there was a price discrepancy: $18 on the sign when you enter, $19 on the menu, $18.95 when the server went to ask about the previous price differences, and finally listed as $14 on the website. Of course they were charged the highest price of$19. It is not worth the price nor your time for the all you can eat catfish.",

I could have made a meal of them....  For dinner we ordered the blackened chicken pasta and the Crawfish Etoufee. The pasta was really good and came with a very seasoned breadstick. I really liked how it was lightly sauced and not drenched. The chicken had a perfect spice to it. The Etoufee was also spicy and super filling. There was no shortage of little crawfish either!   It was filling but we couldn't pass up dessert. Initially, we wanted bananas foster but couldn't do it so we went with the triple chocolate cake. So GOOD!

I had what I eat when we're in NOLA, crawfish ettouffe and while I didn't expect it to be as good it sadly wasn't even a close 2nd. Along with my crawfish was blue crab crab cakes which were VERY GOOD, granted they were deep fried and a bit heavier than I expected however lots of blue crab meat  and not all filler~ so this was pleasant surprise.

The service was very slow and our plates sat on the table for 25 minutes after we ate . We had to stack them to the side so we could have space in front of us. Just too many mistakes and disappointments in the food. Not hot or too cold you name it. Monday nights are half off wine bottles in which were excited about. When the bill came and that took forever...they had charged full price. I love recommended good places to eat and even like to become a returning guest but in this case no!",

When we sent back half the dozen we ordered no one asked why.  I'm sure they knew.  We were offered bread 35 minutes after we arrived and after we had already sent back the appetizers.  The food arrived cold.  I honestly liked this place but something is wrong and needs to be fixed.  Don't come here until it is.",

    "text": "I moved to Vegas about a year ago and a friend of ours had come to Rhythm Kitchen and said the food was great so we had to come try it being my family is all southern we love Cajun and creole food.  First of all we were seated at a table that was too small for the 5 of us. It took about 15 minutes for our server to even come and greet us. When he finally did he didn't ask for our drink orders he just asked if we were ready to put in our food order. When the busser came to bring us water I also asked for bread and the basket came with rolls and hush puppies which were quite tasty. He also explained that they were short staffed that night due to cutting 1 of 2 servers way too early in the shift. Usually when that happens I know the manager or host would step in and try to be of assistance. However the manager stayed in the bar the entire time to help with drink orders rather than splitting her time. The host we had to ask for the 2nd time for our server so we could put in a drink order and with an attitude she sighed and said she doesn't why he hasn't done that yet.  Our food finally came and it was just ok. Nothing I couldn't make myself at home. When the meal was over we waited for a very long time to get our check and finally asked the busser if he knew where our waiter went and that we were ready for our check. He went to find him and after another long wait the server appeared to make cherries jubilee for another table. When he finished he then brought us our check.  The customer service was really lacking and the food was again just okay. I have worked in the service industry and I know how unpredictably busy a restaurant can get however it is not the patrons fault and the staff still needs to do their best to accommodate every customer in the restaurant. Also I do not blame the staff because it all starts with their managerial foundation. Obviously they have none of that considering we never even saw a manager on the floor. I really hope you guys can step up your game because there is a lot of potential for this restaurant.",

Service was eh below average (for vegas) and food was good however I wish they would of mentioned what dishes come with beef or pork.  We ordered the alligator and crawfish etouffee.  The alligator was pretty good and seasoned well, tasted just like chicken.  The crawfish etouffee was good also with a good amount of crawfish but after biting into the dish we noticed it had cajun sausage all over the dish that is not clearly listed as an ingredient on the menu.  After complaining about the dish the server responded with saying \"most of our dishes has that\" with no sympathy or offering to get that charge refunded.  We had to order something else and after we did he offered to take that off our tab.    I would recommend this place because the dishes are good and flavorful but they really need to put key ingredient like that down on their menu and respond to customer complaint a tad bit better, especially in Vegas.",

But, I love mushrooms so I tried their \"Burgundy Mushrooms\". Unfortunately, I literally was embarking on a woodchip dish. Yes, there were woodchips smothered in my mushroom dish. I informed the server and he is the person who confirmed it. He said he'd be back with a manager, but never returned. I had to leave for an important appointment, so I ended up paying for the mushrooms and left a more than generous tip (BECAUSE HE NEVER RETURNED TO MY TABLE). It's safe to say I WILL NEVER RETURN. I'd rather pay for a flight to NOLA!!!",

Our waiter, didn't take long to come and take our drink order. And we also ordered alligator....... So it seemed like that took awhile to get to our table.  Ok no problem, it finally came (I don't eat alligator) But my party that ordered it, said, there was no seasoning on it.  We all ordered the all you can eat catfish.  So you would think, it's an all you can eat catfish day, they would be in the kitchen keeping it fried up!  We were there for 1 hr.  And our catfish still wasn't at our table.  We brought this to our waiters attention, and he came back and said, they where just really busy.  So we decided to tell him next time he passes by, we were leaving.  We decided to go somewhere else.  Well he was taking way to long to come back, so I went to the waitress station, and told them we're canceling our order, and I need my check now!  He said he would bring it to us, I said, no!  I'm going to stand right here!  I need it now!  We paid, and was out of the door, off to our next spot, to eat!    I  really prefer not to go back!  But they have all you can eat crab!   They really left a bad taste in my mouth!",

Service is always professional and presented with a touch of class. We went in on a Sunday night, in which their house are 5-9 or 10. I suggest making a reservation. We opted to eat in the bar area so we wouldn't have to wait but wouldn't go this route in the future.

Thanks for trying to make one Jane, but it wasn't any good.  This place is a joke.  Food was poorly executed, especially since we were in an empty dining room, listening to musac.  Poahed eggs were hard as rocks and the omelet was rubbery and dry.  $72 for brunch.  Owner/ manager walking around with a bloody mary in his hand (I guess I would be getting drunk too if my business was failing), instead of paying attention to his surroundings.  I think they pay more in linen for the dining room then they do their kitchen staff.  My Louisiana girlfriend is embarrassed that this place even exists..:",

She really knew her wine and food menus and made fine suggestions.  We had Charbroiled Oysters, Rhythm Kitchen Oysters, fried Seafest Platter, Halibut with Beurre Blanc Sauce, Red Beans and Rice, Chicory Coffee, and Bananas Foster. Everything was cooked perfectly. The oysters, shrimp, and cat fish had a great taste and were plump and juicy.   Beurre Blanc sauce is a butter, vinegar, and white wine emulsion..   Some of the best Louisiana / Cajon cooking I've ever had. The corn meal coating used for the fish was light and flavorful, NOT at all  heavy and oil filled like others I have had. Wonderful basket of rolls and the extremely flavorful hush puppies were quite a treat.   If you have a need for spicy or mild with a Louisiana flair then this is the best place in the Las Vegas Valley. The building on Decatur is a fine looking place that stands out from everything around it   Don't miss this, get there soon before the World finds it. What a place for a first and romantic date!!  Libby and I will be back here very soon.  Thanks GROUPON. You have put us in another fine restaurant.",

I have heard of AYCE sushi, pasta, buffets etc... but never ribs. Needless to say I was skeptical but after giving this place a couple of tries on a Wednesday, I have to say I am pretty impressed, about the ribs that is. ;)  The ribs are truly fall of the bone type of ribs. And when you order the next set, they are just as good as the first time around. It truly is an art to find ribs this good in Las Vegas. The only place that comes close is probably Balboa Pizza/Ribs in the District at Green Valley.   Atmosphere is cozy and dark inside like many old NOLA type restaurants but the service is variable depending on who you get. The first time we were there, our waiter was virtually non existent. However, on the second visit, our server was on top of everything and quite attentive.   Overall, I can't really comment on anything else other then the ribs, but if your have a hankering for good ribs on a wednesday evenning and your hungry, its best to head over to the Rhythm Kitchen",

The bread pudding was runny, and the pecan pie and key lime pie were just BAD!  If we had brought our own Biday cake in, they would have charged $3-4/per person to cut it - how TACKY.   Back to the service, maybe it was our waiter but he was one of the worst we've ever had. He acted frustrated anytime someone would ask him anything at all - even for more water.

I had the rib eye which was worse than the rib eye I by from the grocery store.  I've had bigger and thicker rib eyes for sandwiches.  The red beans and rice, which by the way is my favorite,  was disappointing.  The beans were under cooked and the veggies were over cooked.  I expect better quality food for a restaurant that is trying to be fine dining, prices and all.  The service was great and the server really was on top of it.  It was sad that such a nice restaurant was empty on a Saturday night we were the only table in there at 9pm WOW.  Now to the creepy part...... the manager kept counting how many people arrived and would linger and hoover over our table, never once said a word to us just spied.   Manager man I'm also a manager in a well know high end strip restaurant and can I say it looked as if you were making sure we were over 20 people so you could add the 20% grat rather than the 18% grat.  HA HA how funny is that.  You didn't make a good impression on me as well as my party.  I will end by saying while we were not the stellar dining table.  The server seemed to cater to our every need.  Thank you for that.  Will I come back ? probably not due to the quality of food served.  Sorry!!!!",

Very nice, date night / romatic setting with the mood lighting and candles.  Def wine appropriate.  The service was also exceptional....my wine glass was filled as was the water and misc.  Friendly and attentive.  Now to the important stuff...the food!  Easily the best hush puppies I've had.  Packed with flavor with a tiny bit of spice...very very good.    Went with the alligator and the crab topped bread bowl gumbo.  Gator was nice and tender, good tasting as well as the sauce.  The gumbo was AMAZING.  Wonderful flavors exploding in your mouth, with nice chunky pieces of crab thrown on the top, making a beautiful and delicious presentation.  If you do not try the crab gumbo, you missed out of the reason I will come back here.  I tried the platter for dinner.  It came with fried catfish, oysters, shrimp, frog legs, and cold shrimp.  The catfish was good, but I've had better.  Wish it was less breaded...same can be said with the oysters.  The fried shrimp was one of the best I've ever had...just packed with flavor and was still juicy and not overdone like most.  Never had frog legs before...tasted like a chicken with slight saltwater aftertaste...kind of fishy.  It was pretty good, but I can't compare it since I've never tried it.  Was way too full with all the above, so couldn't try to stuff dessert if I tried.  I seriously will come back just for the atmosphere, hush puppies, and crab gumbo!",

Everything seemed in order however when we arrived, no one seemed to know what was going on. Our vegan arrived early and had to explain what she could and could not eat. Several times throughout the night our server needed to be reminded that there was a vegan and he made the mistake of calling one of our guests \"sir\"...several times. I don't know if the server didn't care because it was a guaranteed tip or what but none of them were attentive or even in touch with what was going on. Honestly, had I not been hosting my best friend's bachlorette party I would have made a big stink about the pre-added gratuity.   The food was really nothing to write home about. We were excited because my friend (the bride) had lived in Louisiana and therefore we were having a Cajun themed party- the food fell very short of expectations. Some of the meals were under-seasoned and some were very over-seasoned and sadly the vegan meal was not cooked properly. Dessert was good, but again, they messed up on the vegan option- I mean really, is it that hard to put some powered sugar on some berries??  The truly worst part about it was after the party I reached back out to the events manager to express our disappointment and the response seemed a little defensive rather than  apologetic. She said she would relay the information to the owner and I truly hope she does.",

I got the clam chowder which was horrible. .super salty and not good. Crab cakes were not that good. Jay got the jambalaya. ..rice wasn't cooked... my brother got the pasta with scallpos..totally raw!  We were horrified at the bread which was equivalent to a brick. We ordered desert..brownie sundae which was ok... can't mess up a brownie... the fried ice cream was gross... totally not fried ice cream. But the best part was when we were leaving the little waiter asshole saying \"did you see how fat that woman was\" ya I heard you and when I came back in to confront you you just ignored me and talked to your Co worker... it's no wonder that on memorial day weekend your establishment was empty... our family and one other the only customers. Our bill was about 160 dollars for 5 of us and we will never go back. Hope it closes. UM I'M FAT NOT DEAF..DOUCHBAG",

    "text": "I recently dined at RK and had a great meal!  This was my first time there for dinner and really enjoyed the atmosphere...it is \"fine dining\" with white tablecloths but did not feel stuffy and overbearing to me.  I went with a friend and also discovered that if you check in on yelp and show the server the check in, you receive a free beverage (soda or coffee or glass of house wine).  That was a great way to start the meal!  I just went with a soda and my friend had a hurricane to drink.  She said it was good, but nothing special for a hurricane.  My friend and I shared the sampler of southern fried apps...frog legs, crab cakes, oysters and alligator with dipping sauces.  All were very good and it was the first time I had eaten alligator...tasted like chicken! Hahahahaha  For dinner I had the Crawfish Etoufee.  It was very good.  My only comment is that the rice that it was served with was Cajun style and for me, was way too spicy.  I am not the biggest fan of spicy food because I feel that my mouth is on fire and I can't taste and get the real flavor of the dish.  My friend had the blackened catfish covered in the same etoufee with the spicy rice.  I took a bite of her fish and it was delicious.  She had the same comment about the rice as well...too much heat!.  For dessert we shared the Mississippi Mud Pie and an order of beignets.  The beignets were lite, fluffy, full of air, and totally covered in powdered sugar.  VERY GOOD!  The mud pie was good as well and had a good coffee chocolate flavor.  Would definitely go to RK again...it was a little pricey for dinner so would want to go for lunch and check it out.  Thanks for reading!",

The jalapeno hush puppies are super addictive, the all-you-can-eat shrimp deal was more than my husband and I bargained for (it was so much amazing food)! The macaroni and cheese was divine, our vegetables were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The staff was wonderful, especially Bob, who was super attentive and made wonderful recommendations. Bob suggested the Strawberries Madagascar (a fun and delicious dessert, prepared table side), which we absolutely loved! I have never tasted anything like it at another restaurant. We also tried a few flavors of Abita beer, which were an added treat. The food is authentic, and the ambience is wonderfully elegant and upscale. I would highly recommend this place.",

I was impressed with how nice this place is, inside and out.  You can really tell they put a lot into decorating and keeping the New Orleans theme here, yet upscale.  The lunch menu was short, but had some nice options.  And while waiting for lunch, a basket of delicious little savory hush puppies!  Perfect warm-up while waiting on your dish.  The food was delivered on time and was very good.  Extremely tender steak sandwich, which I intentionally order to judge a place sometimes.  Nice portions with a yummy side of cole-slaw.  I took a look at the dinner menu while waiting.  I'm definitely going back here to try some etouffee.  I hope to keep the 4 stars, or even up to 5.  My expectations are high though.  Overall, great value and experience here.  \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"",

    "text": "Our waiter was a gentleman named Chris. He made good suggestions, and was attentive & very funny. There was literally, not one time, in which I had to ask for a refill. He seemed to have some invisible alert that notified him when one of our glasses started getting low. With his encouragement, we started with the Big Easy sampler. It had crab cakes, fried oysters, (insert o face) fried alligator tails, and frog legs. Now, to be fair to myself, I tried it all. Nothing tasted bad but, I'm still not a fan of frog legs. The texture was way too chewy for me. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fried alligator tails. They were seasoned well, and with the crispy flour coating, I just told myself they were a different kind of chicken nugget, so my gag reflex wouldn't overpower my taste buds. They didn't really taste like chicken, just a different kind of meat. The fried oysters and crab cakes were both good. I had a little oyster shell fried into my oysters, so that kind of threw me for a loop. And the crab cakes didn't have enough \"crab\" flavor for me, probably because they were slightly overpowered by all the green onion.  For our entrees we shared the crawfish duet and seafeast platters. The crawfish etouffee was rich, thick, and delicious. And I had a genuine regret that one of us didn't order the endless fried catfish dinner, after we ate the catfish from the seafeast plate. I was also a big fan of the red beans and rice and fried shrimp. I could have taken or left the fried crawfish tails, I think because I wanted whole crawfish I could peel and suck all the juices from and the little tails just weren't doing it for me. And there wasn't much to say about either the boiled, peel & eat shrimp or, the fried oysters. I'd say the entrees were good enough that we'd want to go back, and try some other things. For our dessert though- I died and went to heaven. Beignets, that were so hot and fresh you had to let themc ool off to eat them. And vanilla ice cream covered in fudge and raspberry sauce, with strawberries and raspberries on the side. I'd go over and over again, just to get dessert. (Or the fried catfish or crawfish etouffee)  All in all, Rhythm Kitchen is a good meal and a good time!",

Anyway, even with the dissatisfaction from 50% of the table, my food was delicious. I had the crawfish and shrimp etouffee and it was outstanding. I had never had the dish before (I know, I know) and I wanted to try something different. But when so many others are complaining, it just makes it difficult to enjoy your own food.  So I got some kind of rum punch to take the edge off and this drink was huge. It came in a goblet and after I finished that, I didn't even finish my food. The best part was how ACCOMMODATING the service was for each person. Tawnee (sp?) went over and above the call of service to please our group and a bad experience was expertly averted. And the bartender did a shot with the birthday girl! How fun!",

I simply let him ramble on and on about the VIDEOS, thanked him and hung up. NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

    "text": "When checking in, I saw that this place only had three stars. That's never really a good thing, that its reviews are so all over the map that it's a decided three stars. I went in with an open mind and did not want the Yelp-tariat to sway my experience one way or another.   When we walked in, no one was at the host station for several minutes. I realized later that it is because they have one host, and that he was seating a table when we walked in. Not the best way to be greeted at a restaurant--an inexplicably empty host station, but it ended up being okay. We were seated soon after the host reemerged.   The hush puppies were absolutely spectacular. We asked for extra. They have a nice kick to them as well as the savory fried deliciousness that hush puppies are famous for. They had delicious flavor and were maybe my favorite part of the meal.  I was really, really in the mood for steak, so despite the menu advertising that they use choice USDA meats from corn-fed cows, I got the petite filet for $23. (Saying that your steaks come from corn-fed cows isn't exactly something to be proud of. Most of the beef in the US comes from corn-fed cows. It's not unique so the fact that it was advertised so prominently on the menu was confusing to me. Cows don't naturally eat corn--they eat grass. It's our American methods of ranching and food supply in the last 50 years that have decided that cows eat corn. But I digress.) I also ordered a side salad for $4. The rest of the group ordered a couple other things: crab cakes, pastas, and catfish.   Everyone enjoyed their meal, and I must say that even though I have my reservations about corn-fed beef, my filet was delicious. Everyone seemed to like their dishes as well. My mom ordered something off the Restaurant Week menu, one of their pastas, and she loved it.  The one fail for the meal was dessert. The \"bread pudding\" is not bread pudding but more a coffee cake with a really odd white bourbon sauce. Not like the bread pudding I have had before and really dry and tasteless. The creme brulee was not fresh--the sugar topping was not hot or really crack-able.   All in all, a really enjoyable meal, save for dessert and the corn-fed cows nonsense. I would definitely like to try it again!",

Sat at the bar this time instead of restaurant.  Service was quick and friendly at first .. but we finished out drinks and food and waited awhile for the bartender to return and  ask if we wanted another round.  The bartender was polite and friendly.  The food was good and the martinis awesome ..however the idea that the bartenders have to set up water at each table that arrives is ridiculous, and really slows down the pace of the service.  Everything was great except for the service timing.",

The bar staff was great..mt drink was the best however when we moved to the dining room im sorry to say the service was apathetic and we were treated as an afterthought.  Our server acted like we were a bother to him: no introduction no compassion no hospitality.  I didn't realize that bread wasvto be offered until I looked around and ALL the tables except ours had bread. He ran by and SLAPPED the desert menu on our table without a word! And we were the first ones there!! For the prices and supposed ambiance we should have been treated better. Also the hostess took a call as she was seating us making us stand around. Again we were THE ONLY ONES in the dining room!! The food was good but with service like this it is NOT worth spending Your hard earned money only to be treated with apathy and disdain. As customers we deserved better.",

I had the catfish platter with a side of red beans, I loved it, but I have to try other dishes. This place is on the other side of town from me so it will take a while. lol  Waiter was a little pushy, but still decent service.",

We then had to wait 20 minutes for another two legs.  It was totally pathetic!  They claim that they offer \"all you can eat crab\" but in all reality they make you wait forever for your next plate.  I would rather be charged more than have them be cheap with the crab. I won't be back here!",

    "text": "Ate at Rhythm on tuesday with the girl and my daughter. From what i understand, they've been open less than a week.   I've been intrigued by this place since they started building it last year - thought the building was in an unusual location - thought it was going to be an office building - wrong !   When i finally saw a sign saying steaks/seafood i was thinking - great a local spot for me to frequent. But by the time they open, i move, but i still drive by often so i gotta try it.   I was a little surprised by the lay out - open dining area, tables close together , no booths per se and the tables are too damn small ! The entire upstairs is a banquet area - good luck there !   We order several apps - Crawfish tails($8.99 ) , alligator tails ( $9.29 ) , calamari ( $11.29 ) , Charbroiled oysters ( $9.79 ) - overall, very average. The calamari is way over priced for what you get. The oysters were decent, I challenge anyone to taste the crawfish tails blindfolded and guess what they are - too much coating, small lil niblets .  We also shared a seafood gumbo bowl ( $6.79 ) - my daughter impressed me ( she tried it first ) - \" they burnt the roux \" - WOW ! she actually listened to me after years of making gumbo - i tried it next - she's right and you can see it - lil flakes of black in the gumbo, bitter. And they still served it ??!?   I went with the bbq ribs ( $16.99 ) includes 2 sides - mushrooms and asparagus - i loved the sides, they love butter and cream ! the ribs - the meat was good - the sauce a little to sweet for me ( strong molasses flavor )   Daughter tried the salmon ($16.79 ) with spinach and mushrooms - good.   The girl ordered Seafood delight with rice and broccoli ( $15.29 ) - basically shrimp, catfish and i believe oysters in a cream sauce - delicious !   We shared a bananas foster ( $8.79 ) - not bad but damn expensive for what you get !   had a nola beer - abida - very tasty ( $5.75 )   Overall, it's a toss-up , gotta give them a little time to work out the kinks, i think the pricing might be a little high. Definitely will try again in a month or so to see if they've improved. I wish them all the luck   Happy Eating !   pics posted",

It started when we ordered a bottle of wine, it seemed we waited for ever for our wine. Then we waited for ever for our meal. When we received our meal, my wife's steak was well over done. My wife ordered her steak Med. rare, because we waited so long for meal my wife did not want to reorder her steak. Also my beans with my order came to me out cold. The Mgr on duty took the steak off the bill. When we come back, we will not have Tyler as a waiter! We came for a military Retirement celebration, we didn't expect to receive bad service! We still made the best of the celebration. I hope Tyler receives the training he needs to be a good waiter! We will back to the restaurant, he is not the only waiter at the restaurant.",

    "text": "Before I get into this review, let me preface that I will try this place again.  I was hoping for a little more from my first experience here, but I must see if what I am looking for actually exists here.  First off, let me compliment a big thing: The outside of the building looks great.  It looks like something out of New Orleans, even if it is a standalone building.  I've found architecture in Vegas to generally be incredibly boring, unless it's on the Strip or in a residential area before the 1990's.  Thank you for actually trying to BE something instead of the bland store front.  I've been wanting to try the place for weeks, as I am well-versed in Cajun food from my Grandmother, my numerous visits to the French Quarter, and my own cooking experience in a restaurant.  So I know what the food is supposed to taste like.  But the food here was bland.  Semi spicy, yet bland, and I've no idea how they managed to pull that off, seeing that it's such a contradiction in terms.  We ordered the alligator tail for an appetizer, and I had to try their gumbo.  The alligator was decent enough overall, but the gumbo was missing... something.  It drove me crazy trying to figure out what it was, even to the point of thinking about it on the drive home, before I went to bed, and when I got up the next morning.  I had actually brought some home, and I still tried to figure it out, to no avail.  It was mildly spicy, but didn't have that rich roux flavor.  The service was fine and the atmosphere was fine, so I had no complaints with either.  I was concerned that I was a little underdressed, but viewing the table next to me put those concerns at ease.  Tricia put it best: They need someone who better understands the food, as Cajun is a very different beast that either people love or simply don't get.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"bonafide\", either.  They definitely need a more robust roux, one that makes the sweat stand out on your face and your nose sniffling a little.  Anyone who has attempted Cajun cooking knows that outside \"The Trinity\", the roux has to represent as well.  I will go back.  I want to like them, and perhaps I simply haven't found the right food combination there.",

Crescent City Pasta - Linguine, Crawfish,shrimp, scallops, shrooms, spinach (YUM!) Hazelnut Crunch Bar - A bit on the sweet size.  Big enough to share  Pros:  * Large portion  * Decently priced menu  * Large selection of items on the menu   Cons:  *  I don't really have any complaints for this place.  =)  Overall: I'd definitely recommend this place and I would come back myself.  There's so much I want to try on the menu: Jambalaya , Rhythm Kitchen Oysters, & Firecracker to name a few.  Whenever I do make it back, I'll update my review with more specifics.  Tips: * Memphis - style is amazing on the ribs! * Check website or call restaurant for nights where there is live music. * Regardless of the low lighting, I wouldn't come here if you are looking for a romantic dinner, but definitely a lively atmosphere and good eats!",

    "text": "I wanted to try a new type of cuisine for my birthday, something I hadn't experienced before, so I looked up Cajun/creole restaurants and found Rhythm Kitchen on Yelp. A friend of mine had been before and loved it, so I decided to try it. My family and I were seated immediately and started with an appetizer of the breaded alligator, which everyone at the table loved, including my picky grandmother! Here's a picture of her when she realized she was eating alligator and not chicken lol. For dinner, I decided on the crawfish etouffe, which was fantastic! The crawfish were cooked perfectly and I could've drank the sauce that came with it. My mom had a steak and enjoyed it, and my grandmother had the blackened chicken pasta and loved it too. For dessert, we split an order of fresh baked beignets and I tried chicory coffee. The atmosphere was beautiful, service was prompt, and it was overall a wonderful evening, I definitely recommend Rhythm Kitchen!",

In the dining area I had catfish fillet and asparagus well seasoned very tasty. The hush puppies were mouth watering. I cannot forget our charming waiter Louis who made dining there a good experience. He even helped sang to the birthday gurl. Well done",

I understand that accidents happen, but the rest of the experience caused for me to add it.  2. I asked about an appetizer, never ordered it. They brought it out to the table anyway.  3. When we gave the waitress, Allie the payment envelop, she looked at it right in front of us, looking at the tip. 4. The waitress came back with our comment card, walked to the front and gave it to the manager, read it in plain sight, making a very awkward environment.  5. You would think that something would have been taken off the bill??? Nope!  Although the food was good, service is really important! Probably won't go back!",

The service was quick and our server, James, was super friendly.(He gave some great advice for where to watch fireworks for the 4th of July)  Now for the best part, the food. We had steaks, Cajun pasta, salmon and kids chicken fingers and steak bites.. ALL of it was awesome. My steak was so tender and flavorful I didn't even use steak sauce!(I never eat steak without it..except tonight) Even the kids steak was flavorful, and my sons chicken fingers we very tasty. For desert, we had bananas fosters made at the table-side. It did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place and will come back when/if I ever make it back to Vegas.",

Another hour before we received our appetizer, calamari, which were seasoned well, but rubbery and cool. I and my wife used Yelp check-in for the free drink, but was emphatically told that I would have to drink both and couldn't share. Maybe that's the rules, but why be so rude about it? It took another hour before the entrees were served. I had the N'awlins Seafood Delight, which the sauce was delicious, but the fish was overcooked, being mushy with little texture. My wife had the salmon, which was very good, but her vegetables were cold.  We never received water refills, nor did I receive the 2nd drink from my check-in. The waiter spent most of his time chatting with the next table, who curiously , had one diner able to come and go to the kitchen as he pleased. We had to ask for the bills, and and was overcharged for the drinks that was corrected. We finally had to ask a passing waiter to take our payment, and after 10 minutes, another to bring our change back. Our original waiter then came back and asked did we want dessert, but no, we wanted to be home by midnight. He then blamed our split bill for the slow service. That had nothing to do with the long food wait and poor service. Needless to say, there 11 people who won't be coming back.",

From the time we got there everything just went left field....1st of the hostess said that we have to wait 25 minutes to be seated ...then 2 other couples came n they went straight and got a table....then we went upstairs to the buffet and they were out of crab legs...not good for a all u can eat crab leg buffet...the food was cold the buffet line look run over, we ordered drinks they came 30 minutes later...the staff was running around with there heads cut off , it was a very very bad experience.  What is really terrible is that my friend does not eat buffet at all and we always sit at the bar in the lounge to eat but now it's not allowed to order all u can eat crab downstairs n you are forced to eat upstairs if you want the all you can eat legs. Terrible !! Also as we were sitting there we observed how much crab was really wasted...people piled therebplates full and then didn't even ate them...what a waste !! I really used to look forward to Tuesday but after this experience I will not be returning . Very disappointed.",

Our server was nice, but it was clear he never served before....and I am a waitress that works at a strip casino. I was with my husband and two friends, my friends arrived first and they told me they waited 25 min for their drinks and they were the only ones sitting at the bar. We sat at a table in the bar area and I told my waiter that I would like an order of alligator while we looked at the rest of the menu. It was \"All you can eat ribs\" night, and my hubby and friends wanted that but couldn't get it cause we were told they ran out. My friends said there wasn't anything else they saw that they wanted (picky eaters, definitely not the restaurant's problem) so they wanted to leave because they were already annoyed with they drink situation.  This is 20 min after we sat down, and still no app.  I told our waiter that we wanted to cancel the app order, and he looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about. I totally understand messing up and forgetting an order, but he came back with our bill for our drinks and said that he didn't put the app order in cause he wanted the app to come out with our dinner. My husband asked him what was the point of having an APPETIZER if it came out with the dinner, the waiter just stammered and tried to make up an excuse. Disappointing. Maybe they were just off their game that night, but a bad first impression for sure.",

Sadly, the shallow bowl with overly salted roux was disappointing portion wise.  I had to ask for more rice to balance out the salty sauce. For the price they charge, you would think they could add a little salad.  On a positive note, I do have to say that the crawfish were cooked nicely and quite sweet.",

I tasted the fish and although it hadn't gone bad.....yet, it was well on its way.  I started with crab cakes.  not bad.  for dinner I had the jambalaya.  again not bad but I could have made it in my own kitchen and it would have been at least as good, if not substantially better.  we shared beignets and bread pudding for dessert.  never really had a beignet but I wasn't impressed.  give me a good sopapilla anytime.  the bread pudding was like the rest of the meal.",

I always wanted to come back to try the restaurant portion (big fan of Cajun food) so when the groupon deal came up it was a perfect opportunity. Also great for a date night.  Anyways, the service was great. Our waitress was really fun, nice, and helpful with the menu and recommendations. We started off with a couple of cocktails which was crazy strong!! Well appreciated though! LOL. We got a basket with a couple of rolls and hush puppies which was pretty good. Nothing special. For entrees my bf stole my order of Shrimp Etouffee, so I ended up with the Crescent City Pasta. The Shrimp Etouffee was absolutely delicious! The Crescent City Pasta was really boring and just OK thanks to the crawfish and shrimps. Otherwise I would have to say the only flavor in it was butter. I was a bit disappointed in my entree, but as I said the Shrimp Etoufee is seriously mouth watering delicious. 3 stars goes to the awesome service and my bfs entree.",

    "text": "First, let me say that I really wanted to like this place. I love the building, and the decor is very nice. That being said, the food needs some help. I went with a friend with a Groupon for $40 worth of food, and they let us use the Groupon for liquor as well, a nice touch.  We ordered the crab cake appetizer. First, they were not crab cakes, they were crab balls. I believe they were put in a deep fryer, and not pan fried. They were basically crab ball things you could buy at any warehouse club and dunked in the deep fryer. They were also very salty. Presentation was good and the dipping sauce was good as well.  I had a bowl of gumbo for an entree. It was ok, again quite salty and it had some shells of what I assume is some shellfish that was in the gumbo (shrimp shell?). No big deal. I would eat it again.   My friend ordered the \"all you care to eat\" ribs. They came with a side, and he chose Cesar salad. Salad was tasty but overdressed. The dressing tasted like just about any bottled dressing you can get at a grocery store. I tasted a small piece of the first plate of ribs and they had a distinct taste of \"natural gas\" or lighter fluid. It was a bit strange. They refilled his plate and he said the second small rack (I assume appetizer size) was good. The third plate tasted freezer burned and stale. I don't know how they make their ribs, but it seems like maybe they have pre-cooked ribs that are frozen and they either boil them and then grill or just directly grill. The BBQ sauce on the ribs was good.  Service was good, but they do seem tremendously overstaffed with a host, several servers, bus boys, etc.   The menu itself seemed too large. Do they really need to serve pizza on the main dining room menu? I think I would come back to try the happy hour as they are one of the few places that promote Eberle winery, one of my favorites. Although we did not order any wine, the wine list was ok, but seemed a bit overpriced for the location. The 1/2 off Monday wine would be good.  Overall, I would not return for dinner, but would try the happy hour.",

    "text": "I lived in the south and was having a craving for \"soul food\". As soon as we sat down I felt like our waiter, Robert, was not interested in helping us. This manner was abrupt, impatient, and cold but he gave other tables much more personable service. My friend and I are Asian and the other tables were black or caucasian, at first I felt like maybe it was racially motivated but whatever as long as the food was okay. The table next to us apparently ordered the same items as us and their food was delivered to our table and we had to remind the waiter to bring out the second side dish. My friend and I both took out our phones and started drafting reviews for Yelp. In my personal opinion the waiter saw this and changed his tune all of a sudden. Suddenly the service was 100% better, but it shouldn't take a threat of a negative review to make the level of service excellent. You should treat each customer like they could possibly review your establishment. Our waiter did his best to make things right and I appreciated it. Robert brought us complimentary fried risotto with veal sauce and for dessert our beignets and were free. I truly felt that we were more than compensated for the ever so small mistake and like I said the service did a complete turn around. We will be back. Food was delicious!",

It is so greasy that rather than a sauce or soup your food swims in a grease ocean. I'm a fan of greasie foods being from the south but this place seems to cook new york pizzas and wring them out into the food. That being said the staff is also lacking. They appear to be professional but even when it was slow we practically had to beg for drink refills. There are 3 good things I can say about their establishment. It's clean, has a couple of attractive waitresses, and the hush puppies are actually pretty good. I did eat here twice, so not just one bad experience. Just misplaced optimism haha!",

Not too oily either.        - Price - A little on the pricier side, but you get what you paid for.        - Shrimp size - Large to Jumbo.        - Decor - Classy Cajun feeling. Good date place. **Price**        - $50.00 for two. **Ordered**        - Rhythm Kitchen Platter - The fried items are very crisp and not too oily               - Catfish - Comparable to Hush Puppies but not as tasty as Catfish Alley.               - Fried Oysters - First time having fried oysters. They were fan-freakin'-tastic               - Fried Shrimp, Cold Boiled Shrimp - The shrimp were a lot larger than I expected and delicious.               - Frog Legs - Never really liked frog legs. These were a tad bit on the hard side.        - Jambalaya (Lunch Portion) - Very good. Similar to the Jambalaya and Elephant bar, but with more ingredients.        - Fried Seafood Po Boy (Shrimp) - Six hefty shrimp in a po boy with steak fries. Way better than the tiny shrimp po boys from Sweet Factory. (Other options to fill the po boy: alligator, oyster, or catfish.) **Recommendations**        - Pretty elegant and scrumptious place for a night out.        - If you're looking for upscale Cajun, you've found it.",

Dress indicated \"casual\" , they made an issue of my friend wearing a tank top and after all that's not acceptable wear for them. Mind you the tank top was brand new and he looked very nice in it. We arrived a good twenty minutes early and so headed to the bar for a couple Coronas. 2 beers - $11 plus tip. The restaurant is located in an industrial section of Vegas. You literally feel like you're heading to a storage warehouse somewhere. The first hostess was very nice ( Asian of some sort) , when we headed to the restaurant after the beers we encountered the hostess from hell (blonde white girl) who proceeded to read us the riot act about the dress code. I was so pissed off and obviously felt slandered by this gal that I told her we wouldn't be eating there. We proceeded to leave when she attempted to placate me by offering to get it ok'd by the manager.  REALLY , you must be kidding. Will never be back even if the food was free.  Keep your loser restaurant. I can't imagine anyone from the strip going out of their way to eat there anyway. DISGUSTED.",

We had incredible service from our server Ivan, and the manager came over and introduced himself as well which was a very nice touch. The Firecracker Tuna appetizer was very good. 3 of our group of 5 had the all you can eat snow crab (myself included) and I was very impressed! It was delicious. I also loved the Jumbalaya that came with it, and we ordered a side of mushrooms in some kind of sauce and those were very good as well. They took it upon themselves to bring my friend an ice cream sundae with a candle in it for her birthday and we appreciated that very much. They have both beer and wine flights and we ordered one of each- those do seem like a good deal for the amount you get. The only issue was that one girl in our group tried to use the \"Yelp check in\" for a free drink, which stated that house wine is included, but she wasn't allowed to use it for her glass of house wine. It was no problem though, maybe they just need to update their rules for that coupon. The bill was $228 for 5 people (one didn't order a dinner), which was maybe just a bit more than I expected, but I really enjoyed the experience so I would certainly return.",

FYI The lounge is towards the north part of the building. The food and well drinks are like $3-7 and since we are in Vegas I thought they would bring out happy hour sized portions like other restaurants do, but instead they bring out regular sized portions at happy hour prices! What a novel concept. It's so funny how some restaurant advertise happy hour and the portions are so small. Imagine ordering ribs at happy hour and getting one rib for $3. I mean come on, thankfully this place doesn't do that.  We ordered the pizza, b/c I was hungry and I didn't want to chance not liking the first dish. We then ordered the pickle chips, jambalaya, clam chowder and BBQ pork sliders. In all honesty we're not fat people, we just didn't know the size of the portions. Vegas does this to diners perceptions. You have to over order to get a full meal nowadays. All the food ordered was great, but the chowder and pork sliders were a bit salty.    The bartender Kitty was great, but they lost a star b/c they had a DVD of that ugly, annoying dolt Harry Connick Jr. on repeat. I was ready to scream. I could never get used to hearing his music.",

We started with the cajun grilled scallops over rice and fried alligator.  White alligator meat isn't a problem, but the dark meat is a bit game-y.  I ate it, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have.  The scallops were definitely blackened and good with the sausage they skewered together.  The main course was a Snake River Farms NY Sirloin that the server said was wagyu-like.  I am going to assume he meant American wagyu because the meal was only $39 and included blue lump crab meat.  Anyway, the steak was pretty tough for a Snake River Farms cut but it was well seasoned, no doubt.  The crab meat was nice, and I never ordered an oscar-style steak before.  That being my first time topping a steak with anything, it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have.  The side of mashed potatoes and the veggies were just as big as the steak.  Needless to say, they really should cut the side dish portions down.  It was a waste.  Dessert was skipped because the food portions were huge as it was.  Overall, for $156 bucks it was okay, but I wouldn't come back again.  The service was interesting; he was a nice guy, but the rush to leave the table after our order or after checking on us felt just a tad like we were imposing on his time.  I still tipped him reasonably well because he kept the water topped off.  There's just one thing I'm worried about--the air fresheners.  I cannot begin to explain the overwhelming scents of Febreeze in this restaurant.  It's to the point where I swore something rotted and they were masking it, or the carpet is musty and they're masking that.  I just don't like seeing Febreeze spray bottles in my hostess's hands when we walk in and those standalone units above a few booths.  Scary to me.  If you believe my opinion counts, then here it is:  don't go there unless it's one of those \"we need to try every restaurant in Vegas at least once\" kind of moments.  Portions are a good size, but the overall experience is lackluster.",

We knew it was Mother's Day so we found a place that would accept reservations PLUS THEY TOOK OUR CREDIT CARD to hold our reservation. Our reservation was for 5:45 & at 7:30/7:45 we get seated. Long story short we should have just left because after getting seated it was one thing after another of miss management failures. This place was definitely NOT PREPARED for the amount of people that came to enjoy a nice Mother's Day dinner. Running out of food, over booking, ECT... Then management was rude & handled situations poorly. Sad to ever have to leave a review like this. I say we have a LOT of wonderful restaurants here in Vegas, try one of those & keep on driving by this one!! Again Epic Failure!!!!",

We went into the bar for a cocktail while waiting for a member of our party. Nice atmosphere and quality alcohol. The drink was made to perfection. The bartender notified the server that our full party arrived, and we were seated. I had never had alligator tail and we ordered both the blackened and the southern fried. Wow! I LOVE IT! It was nothing like I imagined. If I ever just want an appetizer and drink, this is it.  I ordered the surf and turf with the filet and was not disappointed. I got an 8oz cold water lobster tail along with a very thick and tender filet mignon, cooked to a perfect medium rare. The service ( Emily thank you!)  was prompt and courteous. On an afterthought,  I ordered a bread pudding to go because I do love bread pudding. That was the only disappointment. Don't do it!",

Rob and Mike were awesome bartenders and very friendly. The only thing I dislike about the last visit(last night) is the food was just ok. I never received a bread basket with dinner, but I guess they were just so busy and forgot... Was really looking forward to them hush puppies too.. Next time!!! While sitting at the bar on my date of one, lol, I met a regular customer and she had nothing but great things to say about the place. She told me last night was actually her second time dining there this week. So they must be doing right!  If you love creole/southern food this is the place to visit! Just don't come on a crazy holiday! Lol",

We arrived to the establishment around 7 pm.  The outside seemed very impressive and the parking lot was crowded.  We ended up sitting in the bar area because it was a very busy night.  We waited rather long to get a menu and drinks.  By drinks, I mean a water and a soda so nothing difficult.  We finally ordered.....my husband ordered the alligator tail appetizer and a caesar salad.  Guess what?  They were out of caesar salad!  Really??  He ended up choosing a shrimp cobb salad instead.  I ordered char-grilled chicken with 2 sides. Some customers came in after us and had ordered with a different waiter.  We did receive our appetizer but no main course.  Everyone around us was getting their meals so I finally asked a different waitress where our food was, otherwise we would just take our check.  This was at 8:30 pm.....1.5 hours later!!  We could see our waiter and the waitress in deep conversation as well as frantically looking at their computers.  Finally our server came over and said that our \"ticket\" for our meal didn't seem to be in the kitchen even though he put it in.  What???  We received  our appetizer, so obviously our order was put in so why didn't we get our food?  He offered to put it in the order  now but we declined asking for our bill.  He said don't worry about it since it was just drinks.  I was honest and said it was drinks and an appetizer.  He proceeded to bring us our bill with no apology, no manager to smooth things over, nothing!!  I have never had a restaurant dining experience like this ever before.    Also, the environment was very loud.  We had to yell to each other in order to have a conversation. Needless to say, service, selection, and atmosphere was very disappointing.  I wouldn't even go back if we received our meal for free!",

The outside of the building is beautiful and a bit deceptive when compared to the actual dining room, which had way too many tables in it. So many that the servers couldn't navigate the room without bumping into my chair EVERY time they passed me. The dining room was very loud, too. Perhaps due to the fact that the place was packed, but loud nonetheless for a white table cloth experience. We started out in the bar, but moved to the dining room because live music from upstairs poured into the bar and made conversation challenging. This was topped off by  a child at the next table who cried loudly for at least 20 minutes. No one on the restaurant staff asked the parents to take the child outside so people could eat in peace. The service was ok to start, but our empty plates sat in front of us for 20 minutes before I asked the server to clear them. Bottom line: excellent food, but if I go again, I'll get the food to go. The atmosphere and service are better at home.",

Obviously the prices are much higher on the regular menu but it's still worth it. The New England Clam chowder is one of the best in town, close to California quality but not quite. They have an amazing BBQ Crawfish Spinach Dip that I've never seen anywhere else and crave it often.  The only issue I had tonight was the fact that our server charged us a sharing charge but didn't inform us that there would be one. Also, our appetizer and dinner came out all at the same time and our server's comment was, \"the kitchen must be fast tonight!\" Well, obviously! That's the reason for the 4 stars, otherwise it would be perfect! We will continue to come here but will most likely stick to happy hour.",

We used to come here when we were visiting Vegas. It was a great place. So sad to see they ruined it by changing to a buffet.",

    "text": "Check your bill!!! We went last night to try it since we got a Groupon. We ordered a ribeye with truffle Mac and cheese and the seafood delight. After Groupon our bill including the added gratuity (for a party of two) was $47. This morning we check our account and there's a charge of $64 from Rhythm Kitchen. Looks like someone got a tip on top of their tip. Aside from the fraud, the food was ok. Honestly nothing special. Everything was greasy. If you like your vegetables soaking in butter this is your place. The ribeye was cooked perfectly. However, the truffle Mac n cheese had ZERO truffle flavor. Super disappointed about that. If you don't mind waiting forever for service then you won't be disappointed here.  Expect to wait for service...seriously!  It wasn't even busy.  Needless to say I will definitely be calling management today and never returning.  Foodies beware!  This is NOT your place!!!",

One of the drinks was incorrect so we tried to flag down our server. It seemed as though there was only ONE server working the area in which we were seated. After watching him make his rounds at the three other tables he went back to the kitchen. He then walked back into the area to help all three tables, again ignoring our table. After the third time the server came out we again tried flagging him down and he said sorry one minute and again serviced every other table and walked back into the kitchen. We threw $40 on the table and walked out. NEVER will I try this place again. EVER.",

It's all you can eat ribs night, restaurant just opened and there are only 4 tables that are occupied and have not ordered but you ran out of ribs! We don't understand! So we decided to fine elsewhere. When I told the waitress tbis, she said I understand but can you pay for your drinks?  I said where is the manager, I think the drinks should be compt!

I have visited New Orleans several times, and had some great meals at some great restaurants.  Rhythm reminded me of them, but didn't quite equal them.  Still, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if genuine Cajuns think this is genuine Cajun food.  I had the Shrimp Briochette (sic.), the Gumbo, and the Jambalaya - all of them quite good.  Were these dishes perhaps Creole rather than Cajun?  Maybe - again, how would I know?  But I can say that they didn't overwhelm with the heat, which was welcome.  The ingredients seemed to be high quality and the chef knew how to run an Louisiana kitchen.  We did not have the problems with the service that some of the reviews here describe.  Our server was reasonably prompt and friendly.  The ambiance was nice.  The exterior and interior were both a comfortable version of faux New Orleans, and I liked that it is a good sized stand-alone restaurant.  You don't get a lot of that here in the land of Strip hotels and strip malls.  The prices were also nice.  You could go to one of Emeril's restaurants for a slightly better version of the same dishes, but the prices would be much higher.  All things considered, next time we have a hankering for Cajun food (which isn't often) we will be back.",

A lot of buffets have crab legs, but most of them aren't very good or served cold. There were some restaurants that used to serve AYCE Crab legs ( Im looking at you, Hush Puppy) and were favorites for years. Now the best all you can eat Crab Legs in Las Vegas are at Rhythm Kitchen on Fat Tuesday Nights. The buffet is pretty good, not perfect, but, The crab legs are good and flavorful. Catfish is good and other items are pretty good too. Its a nice crowd and a pleasant atmosphere.  We were served by Chris and even though he was new, he was fantastic. Very pleasant and attentive. The managers came by and we also let them know how much we enjoyed it. I usually work Tuesday nights, but when I do get the night off, we love to go to Rhythm Kitchen for AYCE Crab Legs.

Unfortunately, after a couple of years it started to go down hill. It was always packed no matter what night you came but after a while, and several staff changes in the lounge it wasn't the same. Food went down hill, HH prices went up and people stopped coming. My husband was very perturbed and wouldn't go, I still enjoy it and went with friends. But after a while I could see where he was coming from. Tonight I finally convinced him to go hoping for a good experience. NOT, We had a couple of appettizers, a two drinks a piece. I only ordered a side of Mac& cheese with crawfish, he got the friend oyster dinner. Well, his oysters we're down right burnt. He ate one and he just couldn't eat. Our bartender, which is not his fault, appoligized and took it off the bill. When we got out bill it was still almost $70.00 before the tip. There were two managers there, from the restaurant and the kitchen, and one stared right at us, never came over and said a word. Not I am sorry for your inconvenience, or anything. Needless to say, my husband will never return. I like Jessie and Shannon, both bartender's are extremely nice and attentive. We have sent many people there but will highly recommend it anymore. There are way to many places for HH and dinner to go to. It is sad but no one seems to care",

She was knowledgeable with the menu and even mentioned cocktails. My husband and I ordered the shrimp scampi and the alligator tails. The blackened ones had way too much spice but other than the all the food was all very good. From everything I personally tried it was a very good experience and delicious food. The only thing that took us all by surprise was the gratuity automatically added to everyone's bill. This isn't a huge deal but it would have been nice for them to let us know they were going to do that. So over all they forced over a 50 dollar tip with a group of 7. It was just a bit of a surprise and would have been better if it was communicated.   Definitely will go back one day for the food one day. It is on the pricey side average 22+ per plate. Appetizers 12+",

The ladies! So I get an email from Rhythm Kitchen letting us know they are serving a great buffet of Alaskan Snow Crab Legs, Jambalaya, Fried Shrimp, Beignets, Blackened Chicken Pasta, etc... for the holiday, and it said they accepted reservations. When you have a family of 11 with a range of ages from 5-92, you need reservations! I made a 5pm Reservation originally for 12!   A lot of folks may call me picky. I was as cool as a cucumber on this evening when it came to service. I know it was a holiday, we were a large party, and we had kids. But our table was not ready. Why have reservations? As far as our \"service team.\" Our server ignored us, argued with my guest, forgot items when asked on multiple occasions....When the incident with my Grams happened my Mother's Day card fell on the ledge above their dining room. I asked a staff member for help, thinking maybe things fall sometimes, she brushed us off!!  There were few edible options on the buffet. One of which were the crab legs, BUT, they weren't split. I have a 5 and 8 year old. I couldn't eat for 30 minutes because 1) We had to wait for crackers(my sister literally asked and tested them on how long it would take to get, I finally gave up, got up, and went to their service door to ask someone) and 2) I had to feed them. All of the other hot food items were dried up or looked down right dangerous to eat. Dessert items consisted of sliced fruit and a banana cake. The cake was the only other item I ate that night. Our party of 11 never spotted a beignet once.   The staff were impolitely cleaning and making a ruckus around us before the buffet was supposed to be over. The hot food, besides crab, wasn't refilled once after we were sat. We had until 7 per their email. Just so many little things made our dinner so completely horrible. When it came time for use to wanna get out we were held hostage. I had to again, go to the service door to have our card ran to get released from the Heck Hole those people call Rhythm Kitchen.   Their desserts were on a platform on which my 92 year old grandma tried to step on, slipped, fell, and rolled off of. So if you ever dare to try this awful place be very aware of this hazard, hopefully they'll remove the fall hazard. I have this image in my head to replay over and over for the rest of my life now. I chose this restaurant for our family gathering and now, I feel like a darn fool. You should be ashamed of yourself Rhythm Kitchen.",

I have traveled to New Orleans every year for 16 years and this place is almost as good as being there! My sister (who is a local) and I (visiting from Cali), ordered the Fried Green Tomato appetizer and the Grilled Oysters, both excellent! Our server, Mike was so helpful and knowledgeable! The drinks were all that!! Try the Lapu-Lapu their version of a Hurricane, you won't be disappointed. The Fried Catfish, Mac n Cheese and Crescent City Pasta were all excellent!",

Nate contradicted himself by initially telling us one thing then changing it later. After confronting him he admitted his mistake but we had to fend for our own seats/table in the bar section. Marcus was GREAT however the kitchen failed him as we waited TWO hours for our food. Food was okay but not worth two hours. Received our bills and should have been informed groups over 6 - automatic 18% gratuity. At this point we didn't care and just wanted to get out of there. Disappointing",

The food, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My favorite dish is definitely the N'Awlins Seafood Delight. I literally order this every time I eat here. Every bite is oozing with so much flavor. My waiter Lew, spoke highly of the Charbroiled Oysters, so we decided to try them and they were soooo good. The smokiness they had was perfect. The seafood gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans & rice are also delicious. As for dessert, you can't go wrong with the Beignets. They came out fresh and warm. They also have a pretty good happy hour too. The steak bites are incredibly juicy. I seriously don't think they restaurant has anything bad on their menu. If you haven't already, I highly suggest giving their food a try. I've introduced quite a few people to this restaurant and they've all fallen in love with it.",

You can dress to impress or show up in a t-shirt and shorts if you like.    The menu has a wide variety of Orleans style cooking and everything we had was amazing.  Items are priced well but expect to pay a bit more than some other places. We got a bottle of bubbly, apps, salads, main course and desert for just under $200 with a 20% tip.  It was worth it though.    My fiance's dish was amazing. Na'Leans seafood delight. The sauce was incredible.  I got the SeaBass special which was very good too.   Our server James was top notch and a lot of fun.  The nightly specials kick butt!  We will be back asking for James.",

Reason for a 2:  so we had a buy 2 get 1 free buffet. The waiter accepted it, and 20 min into eating her comes over and starts interrogating us \"where did we get the coupon from.\" The question was asked about 7 times; however, does anyone remember where they get any coupon from? Following this he and another man had a full on argument in front of everyone about how we shouldn't be able to use the coupon.

I should have just made a box of zatarains and would have been better off. The best thing was the bread which was clearly not made in house.

Not only was I truly hungry, but I am a seafood lover and I have never truly expierienced any type of cajun dish...I actually called beforehand to see if a reservation was necessary and the hostess told me no because we were just a party of 3 ...and to come in... We were sat and after a few minutes of waiting the hostess did us a favor of delivering us waters... thankfully...... a good 10 minutes later she comes back to see if anyone has come to our table .. obvviously noone did.  We were all so hungry and noticed table bread was served , so we asked her for a basket.. and she brought one!! ( shout out to the hostess !!) she also asked us if we needed anything other than water to drink.. we told her . She then proceeds to go find someeonnne to take our order... the server comes  . Cool... we ask about the catchbof the day and a couple of other different plates... he tries to describe it the best he could I suppose ,but being our first time there  it was a horrible description as I can read it off the menu exactly what he said. I proceeded to order the scallops with the sauce on the side.. and no pilaf. Just a side of slaw.. the pilaf was on the plate and sauce was not on the side.  They brought my side of slaw.. okay thanks I guess, even tho i was pretty adamant about the sauce. Whatever tho right? I was hungry and they were scallops for heavens sake..  Did I mention we had to reorder our drinks like 20 min later and only recieved them right before dinner?     Anyways once the food hit the table.. everything was extremely tasty.... I asked for the check.. and was speaking to my friend about possibly writing a comment.. and the server runs up on me asking if I needed a pen.. putting a pen on the table.  It was an extremely uncomfortable moment for me.  At first we didnt want dessert but ended up ordering a piece of red velvet cake.  As I dont eat processed sugar in my diet , it was tasty. but dry... o soo dry.... ... last but not least I asked the server for a to go bag as he picked up the check from the table.. I never saw him again.. thankfully some other server retrieved the bag...  I do believe this server was supposed to serve us from the begginning ( the hostess referred to our server as she... and she served the table that came in after us right behind us  ) for all these reasons we will not be returning... there are many great seafood restaurants where service is also GREAT.  Speaking from a servers perspective that is. Its truly unfortunate though.. word of advice to the servers. Communication is key.. even if you're busy... pop by, and say hi . Acknowledge our presence... ..It wasnt a pleasant experience to say the least.",

We had a party of 10 and not a single person could come up with one complaint. The crab legs were juicy, the filet was cooked to perfection, alligator and frog legs were tasty and the blackened lobster pasta was to die for! Jambalaya, gumbo and the sea food chowder was amazing as well. We will definitely be revisiting and would recommend this place to anyone!",

My wife is Chinese (Beijing) and her and her mother are extremely picky about food in general but seafood in particular and crab most specifically. They LOVE it. I do too and I'm not that interested in crab. We always - the three of us - have a hard time finishing it all. It's a labor of love.

We were shocked when we bit into our fish that the fish tasted very \"fishy.\" When I say fishy I mean SUPER fishy. The taste was strong i couldn't handle it and I threw away my entire meal. We also got hush puppies, but our hush puppies were SO DRY and they were kind of spicy. Ive never had spicy hush puppies before so idk the whole thing was just weird. Nothing tasted right and I've been to New Orleans and I think they got this all wrong. Won't be coming back. Would've rather had Popeyes lol  Oh but the customer service was great, so 1 star for that.",

From the stem wear either being dirty to the drinks being spilt on it and sticky, the blackened alligator being too salty, from the salsa being too watery, the guac being too bland and the poke being cut wrong where t made it too chewy. The bathrooms had no hand towels to them not being super about service. If they don't fix what ever is going on this place won't make it the next 6 months.",

    "text": "2nd time eating here and went for the twin lobster tails, blackened. I guess they were out of season as the 2 tails were $59...a bit steep but the $50 groupon took a nice $25 off.  I think blackened is the way to get lobster now as this was probably the best lobster I can remember having in a long while. The tails were cooked perfectly and the blackened pepper flavor hit the spot.  I was in a toss up over giving 3 or 4 stars because there were a few low points to the meal despite the lobster being top notch...  -The truffle mac and cheese lacked any kind of truffle flavor whatsoever, not even a hint.  -The side of vegetables were way overcooked  -The bread in the basket was so hard I clanked it on my dinner plate and it was like a glass hitting glass sound.   -The butter that went with the bread had an odd texture where I doubt it would soften up if it were left out an hour as though it had been dunked in liquid nitrogen. I think they were preformed into little rose pats and then thrown in the freezer (last month).  -It was prime dinner time and I only counted 3 other tables dining in this large room which meant you could hear other people's conversation.  -This last one really gets me. I understand if gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more. But if it's just 1 or 2 people dining, I'm not sure why gratuity of 18% needs to be added. I was actually going to tip 20% on the bill prior to the discount because the service was good and the lobster was delicious (so their insurance against me being a cheapskate actually saved me $1.00)...but I just find it insulting that the waitress needs to take out an insurance policy on her tip because I came in using a coupon...oh this guy might be cheap, I better hit the insurance button. I probably would have given 4 stars if not for this.  The first time I came here was about a year ago and I had the Jambalaya and shrimp E' Touffe. Both were excellent. Aside from the having 3 very good main entrees here in 2 visits, other things about this place could use a step up.",

    "text": "Came here as a fluke, we had reservations for a Steak & Seafood house In Henderson, when we got the call that they had to shut down for a water problem. We were just getting ready to leave, so we headed down the street to Rythym Kitchen to give it a shot.  Walking in, we weren't greeted for a while, almost left. Then things got rolling in a better direction. Loved their ambiance. It's a large space, so you have room. It wasn't crowded at all that night....weeknight post happy hour. It was promising that we would get good service and food from the start.  Had the Firecracker appetizer. That was great: ahi, guacamole & wonton chips. All good. Tried the Lump Bleu Crab cakes; they were good but probably will not order it again....too many other good looking appetizers.  For a crab cake, I think it was too spicy for my liking. Personal preference. The vegetables were blah but the Mac n cheese was all that! :)  Loved their Cashew Vinaigrette Salad, which was not something you can get just anywhere. Had lots of cocktails, all were good but I don't remember the names of all the ones we tried in my group of 4.  Ordered the Surf n Turf, steak and lobster special that evening. My boyfriend likes steak, I prefer seafood. All was good. Steak was better than I thought, had some flavor to it. Cooked medium rare, as we asked. Lobster was pretty good. It was a little tougher than I like. I would try the halibut or peel shrimp next time...so obviously it was a good enough experience to look forward to a \"next time.\"  One in our group had the John Dory, now I would order that again!  Our waiter was VERY knowledgable, he knew the menu back to front. That's a huge plus for me, since I don't eat Cajun food often. We were there for a long time & h never rushed us. He came over to chat with us for awhile. We knew some of the same Las Vegans, so it was nice that he was friendly and on top of service.",

The staff is super friendly and so professional with etiquette and proper manners. Small confession, I came to relax so I didn't even realize the bar menu wasn't their entire selection of goodies. They were so attentive to me hors d'oeuvres orders I never branched our for anything else because the selection was so satisfying.  Properly portioned, cooked to perfection, I didn't notice I was missing anything.  They treated me like I ordered a full course meal! One thing I can say, bringing New Orleans flavor to Las Vegas is a HIT! Surprise your sweetie for Valentines Day.  They make fresh Banana Foster at the table, flames and all!

    "text": "Had a groupon for this place. First walked in, had a sinking feeling that I was in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The place is so big, didn't know where to go. Hostess sat us down, place was kind of empty. More of those nightmares starting to creep in.  You walk in and you already smell desperation. Not from the servers. The service was fine overall. Just that the place didn't know what it wanted to be. It's trying real hard to be fancy. Waiters with the vests, white linen, wine pairings, candles on the table, music you'd hear waiting for the weather on the 8's on the weather channel plays. It just didn't feel like it connected. This is supposed to be New Orleans style cuisine. I'm expected a party, some jazz, some energy and I got...elevator music? Kitchen....nightmares....  Food. The hushpuppies were fine. Bread was old, dry and flaky. The gumbo was not good. It was microwaved as the middle was molten hot and the outside was luke warm at best. Crab inside was fishy. Hardly any sausage. The Crab Cake Elaine was a travesty. Crab Cake over seasoned AND burnt, etouffe tasted strange. The red beans and rice was the worst I've ever had, over cooked and flat out gross. Brussel sprouts came out cold. The Mac and Cheese was also Microwaved AND overcooked. Hardly resembled Mac or Cheese. Kitchen...nightmares....  Spoke with waiter (Rob) and told him we were not happy with what we got. Traded mac and cheese with mashed potatoes and got the shrimp kabob appetizer instead. Waiter informed us that there was a rookie chef in the kitchen and that it was obvious that the crabcake was overcooked. Kitchen...nightmares...  The mashed potatoes were okay, which is saying a lot for how this meal was going. There were bits of garlic in there, which was nice. Sucked that the mashed potatoes were still really lumpy. The shrimp kabobs were strange as well. It was obviously overcooked on one side, charred to hell. My first bite was grittier than all hell. Think that the sauce got burnt on that. The rice pilaf was better than the red beans and rice, but that's like saying the Jets right now are better than the Raiders. Ain't saying much. The rice pilaf was still overcooked and watery. Brussell sprouts again and this time i just unraveled them and they were just stone cold in the middle. Kitchen...nightmares....  Before I even finished eating there, my stomach hurt. It must have known that it was going to pay too much money for this type of food. I left a comment card on there and I did tell them that I could pay $2.50 for Stouffer's and be eating that while watching Breaking Bad in my underwear. It didn't make sense to have the waiters act like this place is some high dining establishment when they can't be bothered to have decent soup or even make mac and cheese. Kitchen...nightmares...  The server was nice, didn't want to send food back, but it was really the worst food I've had in a long time. It was awful. I'm so glad I tried to stick to things that would get me too sick. The rookie chef thing might be True or it could just be an excuse on why mac and cheese is getting microwaved. Whatever it is, it shouldn't be happening. Kitchen....nightmares....",

    "text": "We absolutely love the food and atmosphere at the Rhythm Kitchen and make it our first dinner stop every time we come to Las Vegas.   My wife orders the blackened shrimp pasta and the flavors on this dish are nothing like we've ever tried in a pasta!  The amount of pasta and shrimp that comes on the plate will force you to take the test \"to go\" because there is so much and it is so good!  I switch it up but my go to dish on most visits is the fillet. Yum!  If you like steak, look no further!  The other thing that keeps us coming back is the staff.  Scotty and his employees do not spare a single detail to ensure that as guests, we have the most truly exceptional dining experience possible.   The bar Manager Rob ensure that anytime we order a drink, we get our money's worth for sure! The drinks are poured stiff and heavy and the atmosphere is beautiful.    We live four hours away and come to Las Vegas 2-3 times a year for meetings and we make sure Rhythm Kitchen  is one of our first dinner stops.     If you enjoy absolutely delicious food with a beautiful atmosphere and attentive staff.. Look no further. And add this place to your dinner menu!   *Alex from BKFD",

However, I came here with a wedding party of 15 which had been reserved for months in advance and the service was awful! The table was not even set, the personalized pre-fixe menus didn't appear till well after we had been seated and tried to get drinks. I should mention that we came last Valentine's day and they quite possibly had some staff flake out. Anyway, our table was pretty frustrated by the lack of organization--there was no one waiter helping us, it was sort of whoever happened to walk by.  When I finally did get a drink it was warm and the outside of the glass was incredibly sticky. I believe we spent around two or three hours here overall, and during the waiting we had some interesting people watching--the story we conjured up was that a pimp had taken out his favorite girl for V-day, and they had nothing to talk about so the spent the entire dinner looking at their phones and not making eye contact. Tres romantic. Then our food came, and it was like really slow dinner theater.   The food, as I mentioned, was amazing. However, one plate came out without any sides. We asked one waiter and got told they were out of potatoes but would bring some green beans. Then someone else near me asked another waiter if they had any more mashed potatoes and we were brought out a couple of steaming plates of potatoes, and she had no idea what we were talking about when we mentioned the Mystery of the Missing Potatoes.   Anyway, this was a bad experience but I think I would give this place another try if I was ever back wherever this place is. It felt like a half hour limo ride off the strip, but I'm bad at estimating...",

The calamari and salad were the only decent ones. My steak was thin, dry and tasteless. The sauce was like a regular au jus, no taste of fresh peppercorns, not what it was supposed to be. Their hush puppies were worst than Red Lobster. The service was not very good eother, like they were ready to close the place down. At this rate, they will be closing the doors forever.  Grade: D-",

I mean when he dropped off a dish, he would say pardon me while I set this dish down.... And this happened at all three courses, appetizer, entree and dessert.  The food was good and in large portions so it was hard for me to finish everything. For the appetizer, I had the raw oysters. I am generally a fan of west coast small  oysters but these were southern medium oysters so it was only ok for me. For entree, I had the scallop entree which was a huge portion. There were three skewers with two large scallops each and it was plenty for me to take home. The dessert, a chocolate cake was yummy and was a good ending.   The bar area also had a lot of TVs for sports fans to enjoy the games.   I would definitely come back for drinks and dinner in the bar area.",

It was odd to me that they had everyone crammed in one section of the restaurant instead of opening the other side. The salads we had were fresh and good nd I also liked that we could get a half order of any salad. I had the crab cakes for an appetizer. They were okay, pretty salty though. We both had the rib eye Oscar style. It was okay, not the best steak and I didn't realize their Oscar style wasn't with lump crab meat but instead another crab cake...so I was way over the crab cakes by then! Overall it was good but again for the price (without a groupon) I know there are much better restaurants in this town.",

The consistency seemed a little thicker like Japanese curry.  I've had etouffee at Mother's in New Orleans and didn't recall it being this thick. Maybe everyone has a different way of making it. The spice level was about an 8 which caught me off guard, but if you like really spicey Cajun food this might be right up your alley. The ribeye was perfection! Nice and juicy with a charcoal grill flavor. The baked potato was averagely served without sour cream. The beignets were fresh, big and fluffy. Overall, I loved the service and want to give it more than 3 stars, but for the price of the food I expected higher quality with the exception of the ribeye.",

We enjoyed them so much we ordered another just to pick at while we ate our entrees. My wife had the Crawfish Etoufee, which she said was great.  I had the Ribeye with some burgundy mushrooms on the side, fantastic. Our server, Robert, said he was also a bartender there, and recommended a drink for my wife that she loved, basically an alcoholic Arnold Palmer.  I had a few glasses of wine. On Robert's recommendation, she had the Key Lime Pie for dessert, and said it was perfect to close out the meal. We are definitely coming back, if anything just for more Blackened Alligator Tails.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the GM and the Owner of this restaurant are absolute frauds. I approached the restaurant to plan an event for a Fraternity Bid Day Party. I approached them three weeks in advance and when I came in he told me the F&B minimum was $2000 for a Thursday when his pamphlet only said $1500. I let it go because I realize its extremely difficult and nerve racking have a fraternity come into your business and have a party. He tells me he'll just have to clear with the owner. I get a call next day, we are all set to go. I pay for our event IN FULL two weeks before the date of the event, even though the receipt says $2776 because they charged us for a $150 \"linen fee\" and a $500 deposit on the space even though the GM said there wouldn't be one needed. We paid again, IN FULL, two weeks before our event. Three days before the event, I get a call from the GM saying that the owner saw the party and they can't do it \"because theres a lot of liability involved\" but gives me the owner's number. I call the owner and he tells me someone was shot two weeks ago (before talks of the party) and they don't have a license to even throw the party. Now I'm not unreasonable, so I say all I want is a little help finding a new space seeing as how three days out of a contractually obligated party, the restaurant pulls out. I even would have been cool with a comped meal after we had to tell 300 people now that our party was cancelled. Owner tells me he can do nothing and then proceeds to avoid my phone calls, text messages, and emails for the next week. General Manager of the restaurant does the same thing, but proceeds to add me on snapchat three days later. Completely unprofessional and bottom line ridiculous for \"professionals\" in the industry. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...0 Stars",

The first thing I noticed was the bottle of Crystal hot sauce on the table, that's when I knew the food was gonna be bomb!...I was not disappointed.

I had been bringing big groups there when the Saints were playing football, and they had always had Monday Night Football upstairs in the big lounge which had plenty of room and lots of tables.  They were always understaffed, but if you had a lot of patience you would finally get a drink and some food.  Then one Monday night they didn't have the upstairs open, so I tried to reserve tables downstairs in the small lounge.  I was told I couldn't do that, and when I told the person in charge that I had about 15 people coming in to watch the game, she literally told me that she didn't care.  So my group had to leave the restaurant (along with a lot of other people who couldn't be accommodated) and go somewhere else.   I may have been placated by a simple \"I'm very sorry, but we are understaffed tonight and unable to accomodate you\".   But all I got was an \"I don't care\".   Needless to say, I won't be going back, and will never hold another event there.",

Lacking this sort of first hand experience with New Orleans, I was tickled pink with the Crescent City Pasta, a shell fish dish with lime and spinich.    We all approved of the hushpuppies and honey butter.  The tea was hot but service was slow.  A slight restaurant stench greeted us upon entry in lieu of a hostess.  The decor and ambiance reminded the folks of New Orleans and, all in all, it was a delightful lunch. $35.00 for 3",

I had a sampler platter for an appetizer and was not impressed.  The seafood did not taste fresh and was overly fishy tasting.  I ordered the jambalaya, which was ok, but I have had much better.  My boyfriend had the fried catfish, in which he left almost all of it on the plate.  Service was poor.  Had to ask for a bread basket, food took about 45 minutes to arrive after we ordered it and the waiter Chris, was clearly in the wrong job.  The jazz music was in a different room, so you can not enjoy it while you eat.  Another draw back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm from Lafayette, LA and absolutely love Cajun food, so when I found this beautiful restaurant near my house, I was ecstatic.  The food is pretty good.  The alligator is a little chewy and the blackening seasoning they use isn't my favorite by any stretch.  Other than that, it has a wide variety of authentic offerings of good quality.  The inconsistency in service is what kills me about this beautiful restaurant.  Every time I go, the servers are just off with their timing.  The sequence of service is off.  The entree plops down right on top the appetizer so you can't enjoy them because your rushed, then you wait 30 minutes for another glass of wine or the check.    One experience that I'll never forget is Mardi Gras.  Being a Louisianan, I can totally appreciate how busy Mardi Gras is, so waiting was not an issue at all.  I made a reservation for a party of 8.  Upon arrival, they told me it would be a wait, which I completely understand, due to the holiday and the size of the party.  We decided to go upstairs have a cocktail and listen to the live music.  15 minutes passed, and I went down to check and nothing.  45 minutes passed, nothing yet.  I again went down, and the older lady at the counter said it still wasn't ready.  I advised the lady that this was disappointing as we had reservations.  I'm a hotel manager on the Strip, so service is important, and told her that I didn't understand the lack of service or concern for the fact that my party had been waiting for over an hour even though we had a reservation.  Her response was, having a reservation just means that you'll get served this evening, not that it will be at any specific time, and that they can't turn away walk-in business so you have to wait. This is not a joke....I know...craziest thing I've ever heard.  I asked why they asked for a time when they took my reservation and why they didn't think to notify me upon making the reservation that they followed this bizarre service practice.  And how exactly does making a reservation differentiate me from a walk-in that is guaranteed service?  I used to manage a Cajun Restaurant that also specialized in seafood and steaks in Louisiana, and I was shocked.  Not just by this terrible protocol, but also by the distain and tone in which she spoke to me.  Even Louisianans don't have backwoods practices like this that are inhospitable.  When I asked to speak to the manager, she advised me that she was THE OWNER.  After that, I figure what's the point.  I gave up and went upstairs to enjoy my friends and the great live music.  We waited a total of an hour and 45 minutes.  By the time we got a table, the all you can eat crawfish and crab were almost all gone, so the serving that we got was mostly cold, broken, and small.  If you want a pretty authentic Cajun meal in a nice environment, but don't mind the shotty service and poor management, it's not a bad venue.  Otherwise its a great concept, but doesn't seem like they are very experienced in simple principles of restaurant management.  I used to go once a month or so, now I only go when my friends whom I've taken there request to go with me again.  I prefer the service at Lola's even though it's not as nice a place.",

    "text": "The BF did some research on Cajun/Creole restaurants in Vegas before we headed there again for the second time this month. I was a bit skeptical when he asked me what I thought about trying the Rhythm Kitchen - probably because there were only 2 Yelp reviews and neither of gave me warm fuzzies about the food. Since Creole/Cajun food is the BF's favorite and we're always looking for new restaurants to try, we thought we would give the place a try. On 7/24, we took a drive down Decatur to the Rhythm Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant is a wonderful modern establishment that unfortunately sits all by itself in a deserted area. When we arrived at the restaurant my first instinct was to turn around and leave. The parking lot was pretty empty and it seemed like a ghost town. That coupled with the fact that the place had somewhat of a foul odor. I should have followed my instinct and left. For starters, they give you a lunch menu, but beware because most if not all the prices are exactly the same as those on the dinner menu. And you pay dinner prices for lunch size portions. Are you kidding me! Here's the scoop on what the BF and I ordered:   Jambalaya - Spicy but lacked that authentic Cajun seasoning and flavor. It was also a bit too soupy. Not bad, but I've had much better.   Shrimp and Catfish Po Boy - Large pieces of shrimp and cornmeal battered fish. Just ok. Again, it seemed to be lacking something. A bit bland for my taste.   Red Beans and Rice - Disgusting. Truthfully, the Popeyes Chicken across the street tastes much better.   Cajun Rice - Not sure why they opted to switch the andouille sausage for spicy sausage (as indicated by the waiter), but I didn't care for this side dish. Like the red beans and rice, the Cajun rice had zero flavor.   Sweet Tea - I was really excited to see that they offered this southern delicacy. However, I was very disappointed. How can you serve \"sweet tea\" when the tea is not sweet???   On the upside, they serve you delicious hush puppies with honey butter and they will keep them coming. Just be sure to finish up before 3:00 PM because they will hover over you and attempt to rush you out so they can close up shop early. Bad customer service, especially for a new establishment. Overall, however, I would not recommend this place. There are better places both on and off the strip.",

    "text": "My family of four eats out once a week, on average.  Last night was Fat Tuesday and we decided to finally try Rhythm Kitchen, hoping for a fun evening with good food.  What we experienced was anything but.     Our reservation for 6pm came and went as the restaurant ran out of menus and was unable to seat any patrons until already seated diners selected their meals.  The waiting area is unable to accommodate more than six people who are standing, so it was quite crowded.  We were finally seated in a room that appeared to have too many tables set up for a comfortable dining experience.  There was also a man playing a grand piano for the patrons.  Unfortunately, the low ceilings, loud conversation from too many people in a small room combined with his music made for an unbearable atmosphere.  And we hadn't ordered our meals yet.  The drink menu on the table boasts of a happy hour from 3-6:30 each evening.  There are also happy hour appetizers available on this menu.  I asked our waiter about the appetizers and he told me that the happy hour ended at 6pm.  I showed him the correct time printed in their menu and he then stated that the items had to be ordered in the lounge in order to take advantage of the specials.  I thought it was odd that the restaurant would place the menu for drinks on the table in the main dining areas only to add some caveat in order to take advantage of what they were offering at specific times of the day.    We placed our meal orders (without being asked if we would like anything to drink, mind you) and attempted to speak with each other, but were unable to hear anything due to the noise level inside of the room.  We asked to be moved to a quieter location, which they were able to do, only to find ourselves in an even more cramped area.  The waiters had to turn sideways in order to squeeze between our table and the wall in order to serve booths on our right.  Because we had asked to move, we were now at the mercy of our harried and quite forgetful waiter as we weren't in his section any longer. We procured our own water and serving utensils at some point during the dinner.    Most restaurants in New Orleans carry Abita Beer.  It is a local beer and quite tasty with Cajun food.  In the aforementioned drink menu, Rhythm Kitchen was offering 2 for 1 Abita beers in honor of Mardi Gras last night.  Our waiter finally showed up at our table and my husband mentioned that I would like an Abita Beer.  With a confused look on his face, our waiter asked my husband to repeat himself.  He then stated that Rhythm Kitchen didn't carry that beer and he had never heard of it.  I showed him the menu and he left quickly without asking which Abita Beer I would like to order.  He returned with a dark stout beer and left so quickly that I was unable to stop him and ask for an amber, which I prefer.  He returned fifteen minutes later to check on us, giving me an opportunity to ask him to bring a beer that I would be able to drink as the stout had been sitting virtually untouched the entire time.  Our meal was almost over by the time I had an Abita that I've enjoyed during my trips to New Orleans, but I savored the taste.  Although I was concerned that it would take too long to get my second beer, my husband insisted as it is a difficult beer to find in Las Vegas.    Having already spent two hours at RK, we didn't order dessert and asked for the check.  Our waiter, in one final moment of ineptness, had charged us $15 for the beer that I had ordered.  This is a good beer, but $15 for a draft beer (as it was 2 for 1) seemed a bit steep.  My husband went to the bar to ask the bartender how much a draft beer cost and bumped into our waiter.  After reviewing the bill, our waiter explained that we had been charged for a pitcher and apologized.  My husband came back to our table and our waiter stopped by with a revised check, having taken off the charge for beer entirely.    Although the food was good, the service and atmosphere were inexcusable.  I'd rather spend $150 on a memorable meal that conjures good feelings, not bad.  I won't be going back.",

    "text": "I'm a vegetarian starving in Las Vegas, I've been living off of muffins, fries and cheese for weeks...need...veggies...NOW...!  So today...It's past lunchtime and everyone is starving, so we decided to explore the area for a sit down meal and stumbled across the Rhythm Kitchen.  From the outside, it looked like a New Orleans home (wraparound porch, ceiling fans, etc) in the middle of nowhere, on the inside, the restaurant was completely empty.  When we walked in, there was no hostess to be found, so we picked up our own menus and seated ourselves.  When I opened the menu to pick my lunch, and there was absolutely nothing there for a vegetarian.  At this point, I am thinking this was going to end up a disaster.  Then the Jesse the waiter arrived to take our order, I asked him if he could whip up a vegetarian meal for me out of their offering of sides - broccoli, asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinach on a bed of rice pilaf.  He said, he'd have to ask because it's not a normal entree offering and the individual sides would cost over $20.  He comes back and tells me the manager agreed to sell me the meal for $10.99.  Kind of pricey, but I wasn't going to complain at that point.  When my meal came, it was surprisingly delicious!  SOOO DAMN GOOD!  All of the vegetables were seasoned correctly and cooked to perfections (a bit al dente), the rice was equally good.  It was so good I scarfed it down in about 5 minutes.  When Jesse came back to check on us, I told him that my meal was awesome, and he just looked at me and said \"Really?\".  I guess the Nevadans just don't get the whole veggie thing.  In the end, my lunch companions and I all expected a disaster, but were all equally impressed and surprised at such a find in the Rhythm Kitchen.  Great food, great service.  I'll definitely be back for lunch again, maybe even dinner...They are open until 10pm on the weekdays.  P.S. Yay for me on review #200!!!",

The place had only 5 tables with customers and it took forever to get our drinks and our waiter to take our order.  Waiter was too busy talking to employees.  Food overall was not good.  we had the sampler and main course Jambalaya.  Sampler was just items deep fried in a very bland batter...was expecting some cajun spices or something.  This was something i could get in the freezer section at the grocery store and do myself (it probably would taste better than what i ate).  Jambalaya was very bland as well and missed that kick it should have (it was also very sour).  Overall I would not recommend this place to anyone nor will I be returning.  I tried and was looking forward to trying this place, but it was a FAIL!",

Hubby and I went last night around 9:45 PM (couldn't help the time, I didn't get off work till 9 PM and they're open till 11PM). Hubby was output right away because the parking lot was empty... come on, it was late! We go in to meet a friendly hostess who seats us in the corner. Decor is very nice, romantic. Vince, our waiter, appeared right away to take our drink order, and gave us plenty of time with the menu as we were first timers. We went with:   Appetizer: Artichoke dip with BBQ craw fish and shrimp   Hubby's entree: Prime Rib   My entree: Blackened Chicken Pasta   We didn't go for anything out of the ordinary, but each and every bite that touched our lips was fantastic! The service was just as good, Vince never let our drinks get empty.   Total bill $54.00... and worth every penny! Plates are generous portions, so you leave full with a smile on your face. Highly recommended!",
