    "text": "This is the second time I have been to Four Kegs. Both times I have went the food has been great. I have had the Stromboli both times. I will always try to make a stop here when I am in Vegas. Can't say much for the service. The 1st time it was mediocre and the second time not so great either. I will say the second time I went was late night.(after 1am).  I didn't realize you could still sit in the restaurant area still. My fault. We sat in the bar area which reeks of smoke. (side not they have 1/2 price specials after midnight) During my meal the bartender lights up right in front of me smoking up the air around me. I love the food here but the service is spotty. This is definitely a local dive. Almost everything here screams we liked the 70's and we are staying there. I would recommend this if you are in Vegas and trying to find great Italian and not wanting to do the tourist thing. This is definitely a locals secret. If you are hoping for a nice place to eat. I wouldn't stop here. If you are looking for quality food and don't care about the ambiance. I would say this is a most. Three stars only for service but 4 stars for the food. That's how it averages out. I say get of the strip and go get you a boli at Four Kegs.",

Judging from the outside it doesn't seem very family friendly since we had some kids with us...the group walked in apprehensively but were warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff directed us to the dinning area,  it's not the prettiest of places but once you eat their stromboli you forget all about the look. As a group we decided to try the stromboli, hot wings, pizza, antipasto and several children menu selections.  The hot wings are beyond hot..if you like crying you should try them. The antipasto dressing was delish..next time we will order two antipasto's. All in all...we enjoyed the food, no left overs which is a good sign. Staff is really friendly even though the place was packed, the waitress attended us very well.",

It is True that the bartender will not, and legally can't take your order.  Nevada passed a ban on smoking in places that serve food.  Some of the more popular bars in town have had to figure out ways to still serve their loyal patrons food, while having a smoker friendly bar environment.",

When you go in, you have to walk around through glass doors and back around the bar to get to the little dining room. The decorations is typical bar trend, and kinda ghetto Its what makes it shine. The menu has a vast array of appetizers and sandwiches, and entrees. We had to go in for the \"Boli\" which what they are famous for. They even have vegetarian Boli for the non meat eaters. We went for the Original and it was off the GOT DAMN CHAIN!!! The crust was light, crispy, and absolutely delicious. I never had a crust like that. Crispy, and just salty enough. The sauce inside was outstanding. Just the perfect amount and not over flowing so you can pick it up. The cheese was fresh and tangy and the Salami, ham, and suasage were just flavor explosions. Also we had the wings. Crispy and sauced just right. The sauce had the right balance of heat and buttery goodness, Also weren't drenched in the sauce so it was easier to eat. All the food looked great, as we were watching the crowded dining room get served. SO many things to try so you won't be dissapointed. They definetly have something for everyone. Can't wait to go again with the homies and have a a few drinks and some outstanding food. Until next time, Let's Eat!!",

    "text": "My wife and I go once a month.  Love this place!  Total dive and in a shady neighborhood but the food is worth it.  THE main reason we go is for the Cajun fries.  I'd never had anything like it before and was hooked after the first time.  A light Hot sauce on steak fries and some mysterious seasoning.  Dip the fries in their ranch dressing, it is amazing!  I have had a few things on the menu so will give my opinion: Potstickers were good, mozzerella sticks ok, fried mac n cheese good, chicken nachos were huge but were average to me.  The meatball sub is very good   The cheesesteak sub also VERY good.  I get the famous Stromboli once in a while but got bored with it.  I used to order it a lot but it is inconsistently cooked, sometimes burnt, sometimes undercooked, and sometimes just right.  Also, I do not like their Italian meats.  I suggest you try it though as the first time I had it I was impressed and still order it from time to time.  I usually order the pizza.  I like it because of the flavorful sauce and stringy cheese.  Yum!  Their blue cheese is gross, just throwing it out there as a warning. ha ha,  Definitely check this place out if you haven't been!",

We always wanted to try this place but once you get settled in Henderson you just seem to stay put. We stopped here as soon as we got into the city. Super easy to find. We ordered the Original Stromboli and the veggie appetizer that had cauliflower, mushrooms, and zucchini. The appetizers were good but the Stromboli was fantastic. I don't like beer batter too much but they do stuff right. The crust was great. We shared. I even asked for a to-go container just for the crust I didn't want to leave behind. Not crazy about the Ice T but who cares.........It's all about the Stromboli!!!!  Just looking at the picture above I could taste it and I hate that I'm so far away now.

    "text": "How could you not love a place known for strombolis? This place is a hidden gem outside of the strip that I've been wanting to go since they were on DDD.  They have a few different kinds of stromboli (and even a breakfast one!!!!). Between me and a few other people we tried a 3 of them and I have to say the meatball one is by far my favorite. We tried the beef and cheese one (or something like that) and the original one (or something like that) and the meatball was really just perfect. The small size is good for a normal person, but if you're like me, the large will do. Actually splitting a large stromboli between 2 people is the best deal. If I remember correctly, the small was around $8.95 and the large was $11.95.   Service was pretty decent here and the food was prompt. We got a couple appetizers including cajun fries, which were basically fries in buffalo sauce...I don't really recommend this. Just get the regular fries. We also got the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was. That was awesome. I would get those if I went again.  Also if you get a beer, it comes in this ice cold mug that makes it one of the most refreshing beers. Or if you're like my sexually confused friend and want a bloody mary, they have those too. It was actually my first time trying a bloody mary and it was pretty good...note to self: don't get \"buffalo-ed\" when you're having one...it's not a fun drink to chug. If you don't know what \"buffalo game\" is, look it up.  In conclusion: Get a large stromboli for 2 people. Get the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was Get a beer. Get the meatball stromboli",

Four Kegs gives you the impression someone stopped caring about the business 35 years ago. Robert Irvine would flip out.  Primo, I'm not a fan of carpets where you serve food. They make a joint have a murky smell, especially if you have a typical deep-fried menu.  Secundo, the place is cramped and feels smaller because it's very strangely divided. And tertio, I didn't know where to look! The kitsch carpet pattern, the overly decorated walls, the 60s PepsiCo lit menu boards or the giant screen tv's?  I ordered a Tom Collins and my hubby a Killian's on draft. It wasn't bad, but very basic. The Killian's came in a chilled glass, but it was a strange half-wine, half beer-mug type, which made no sense.  While on my way to the bathroom, I did notice a Guy Fieri autograph. After taking a closer look, I saw this place was actually on his show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\". I wish I had seen that episode, as I would have remembered to not go there.  It's no surprise I won't be back at the Four Kegs Sports Bar, nor will I ever recommend it. However, may people know why I give it one star: I hope no one ever makes the mistake I did while looking it over on Yelp as a 4-star.",

The fucking stromboli costs 12.99$; can I get anything to wet it with besides ketchup that I won't be surprised with on the check; and - Dr. Guy Fieri's dumb hair.  Now I am obviously no stromboli expert. If you are, educate me on how the fuck am I supposed to eat this thing sans marinara sauce.   So, instead of asking one what sauce one would like (none is offered free), the question is framed as such: \"Want any extra sauce.\" Emphasis being added by the waiter on the word: Extra.   Extra means in addition to. At least that is what I think it means. (I am no English major, as you can tell.) So what the fuck is extra about it? Where is the fucking sauce inclusive with my purchases? I mean, if I am being asked for my preference for \"extra\" sauce and all. Do they mean extra than what is inside the stromboli? What the fuck is going on here?  Fuck, man. The rent is too damn high. This place is just \"A-OK.\" - E",

    "text": "So I take my pursuit of Diners, Drive-in and Drives pretty seriously.   I think this place is one of the iconic places featured in the first season of DDD.  While attending a large business convention, I convinced my wingman, the crown prince of auto accessories to visit Four Kegs for lunch.  There is a bar in front, and a small dining room with booths in the back ( access through a glass door). The Stromboli was decent, but not earth-shattering. it did not live up to the hype and expectations. 2 stars Service was courteous and prompt. 3 stars Then there's the smell.  The aroma of stale spilled beer.  That smell is earned at places like McSorleys in the village (Manhattan- one of the oldest continuously operating bars in America), but not here. I don't think they have re-invested any of the profits they have generated from DDD back into their facility or business.   Plenty of parking in front.  The siren-song of the DDD fame drew me in, but unless I hear of improvements, I will not come back.",

A middle aged woman who is obviously high or drunk (or both) should not be handling drinks and serving food.   She spent more time smoking and texting than she did serving.  Great tip, get your grub to go and avoid the circus behind the bar.  Food is a 5.  Atmosphere is a 1.  Bartender is less than zero.",

When we got there, there was 1 waitress managing the whole restaurant...after waiting about 10 minutes (after being seated), we were given menus and a  different waitress who goes by the nickname \"Hot Rod\" took our orders.  1 small stromboli and 1 antipasto salad please.  2 waters.  Not that difficult, right?  Not only did she get our order wrong, but she FORGOT TO PUT IT IN.  We waited about 45 minutes and when we asked about our order the other waitress checked on it and said, \"I'm SO sorry...we'll get that right out.\"  Hot Rod walks by 5 minutes later and asks, \"Did I take your order?  Where are y'all from?\"  I'm thinking...didn't we have this conversation AN HOUR AGO?  We were given saltines and croutons about 50 minutes after being seated...we were so hungry we chomped on packets of saltines to whet our appetites.  How sad is that?  If it weren't for the incompetent wait staff, I'd go back a second time when I'm in Vegas.  The stromboli was delicious (even though she brought out the wrong size) and the salad was nothing to boast about, though the portion was large.",

The beer was about the best thing although it was served in a tiny, what appeared to be, the smallest beer mug I have ever seen.  Not worth the money no matter how cold it was.    The pizza was bland and most of the pepperoni were burned , the chicken tenders were frozen and deep fried as hard as rocks (no joke, really couldnt cut them with a knife). The chili fries were basic fries from a bag, and chili beans from a can.  Ordered with onions and they came plain.  Simply had no good taste of flair at all.    We'll never go back.

She loved the bread.   Minus one star because I thought $9 for a small stromboli was a little steep.  Aren't dives supposed to be dirt cheap?  Nevertheless, I'm sure I will go back there whenever I'm in Vegas again.",

    "text": "We met some friends from out of town last night because some of us are fans of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  This was a place that Guy Fieri used to patronize when he was a student at UNLV.  What more do you need to give it a try?  We got there at 5 and soon two of our friends arrived and 10 minutes later the last got there.  I point that out because there's one table in the dining room that has a sign saying it's reserved for parties of 5 or more.  The waitress knew we were expecting 3 more guests and she brought us drinks.  When everyone was there, we ordered 2 original strombolis and one of the group got a chicken salad but he did try the stromboli.  It's been a lot of years since I ate stromboli in Upstate NY so I was glad when friends from NY suggested eating here.  The stromboli was very good.  It had a thin dough which is something few places do.  I like it the way it was made because you're not eating so much bread.  The filling was ham, cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce.  We also got a side of extra tomato sauce.  The taste was exactly what I was used to from my past life in NY.    Service was very good.  Our server was quite friendly and she had a good wit with our salad friend.  I was so pleased that the smoking bar area is glassed off from the eating area.  The Clean Indoor Act really has helped a lot of us.  I'm a fan of the Four Kegs and I'll be back.",

When I first started going here, I asked \"When does the kitchen close?\" \"Christmas!\" was the reply. So get your grub on here 24/7. 364 days a year. I've read some comments about the smell when you walk in... It smells like smoke, beer and floor cleaner... Up front. In the dining room, it nice and clean. The bar is partitioned from the restaurant to allow smoking. There is a second entrance to the right if you want to avoid the bar all together.  Now, I won't knit-pick the menu. It's all pretty good taken in perspective. The Stromboli is aces, especially after a few beers. I like to get the chicken nachos at the bar sometimes. You cant complain about the portion size on those nachos. Burgers are pretty good too. Only odd thing is they put red wine in the blue cheese dressing and some servings have a little more wine then others. I'd rather just have plain old blue cheese.  I have literally sat at the bar for several hours with 2 or 3 friends. Eaten, had 3 or 4 drinks a piece and been handed a bill for under $60.00... Beat that.  Okay, here's the hipster deterrent portion of my review. No valet, no PBR (I don't think) no hookah bar, no safe space or trigger warning alert system. Just a decent little local public house that is chill and affordable.",

Funny thing was we sat besides a group of people from the same area of Ohio as myself.  This time I had a straight cheese pizza and it was awesome! Thick style served on a wooden pan.  The server was great as well.   Sitting here for a few minutes you see right away they have a lot of regulars cause it seems everyone knows each other.

First, we ordered the cajun fries and the mac and cheese bites. Both of these were the highlights to my evening. The mac and cheese bites could be bigger, so they are less greasy overall, but I enjoyed how piping hot and melty the cheese was. The cajun fries are just fries tossed in buffalo sauce. I love buffalo sauce, so this is a win for me, but it should probably be more aptly named.   On to the entrees: we then ordered a meatball stromboli, and original stromboli, a pepperoni pizza, and an order of chicken fingers with fries. The chicken fingers were typical frozen chicken. I would not order these. The strombolis and pizza were okay. I did not like the sauce. It was like a canned tomato with some sweetness. It needed herbs and spices and less sugar. The doughs are good, but the sauce needs some serious work.  Overall, I won't be back.",

Location is a bit past Fremont if you take I-15 n.   To set the stage I live in Hawaii and a good Stromboli is harder to find then a cure for cancer. I'm literally drooling from anticipation, the sauces, cheese, a nirvana of favors, a gooey paradise.   It was ungodly good maybe because it's been so long. Not the best Stromboli but one of the best I ever had. Sauce not as spicy maybe watered down a bit and the dough although very good, was separating from the cheese like it was previously frozen.  I'm guessing they have to since place is so busy. Place was packed at 930pm at night. Overall worth a trip from the strip.   Pros- fiance loved it, her first Stromboli. Beer cold, lemonade good, very inexpensive. 21 for 2.   Cons- .99 for marinara sauce to come with the Stromboli are you kidding me, should always be standard. this nickel and dime thing with charging for everything not a fan.

    "text": "Stromboli.......Stromboli........That all you need too know about Four Kegs. After three hundred plus reviews not sure what could add. Try I am..This was my second or third visit to Four Kegs. It not very often come but the few times made it been for some late night grubbing. I came for dinner celebrating a hana ho dinner with my old roommate that was in town visiting.   Other friends joined us so talk about deep fried spread of munchies and naturally some Stromboli. The deep fried food aka chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, and zucchini sticks. Nothing special just your normal bar food. If there is anything worth mentioning about them. I enjoyed that they were nice hot hot, not overcooked, and the hot sauce was good on the chicken fingers. Really the star of the show is the Stromboli. I ordered the full size Meatball Stromboli. Awesome! The size is ridiculous. Even the smaller size it can easily be for two and the large if one person can eat the whole thing GOD BLESS. Once you get the first bite never know just might finish the whole thing. I had two pieces left. The reason find it so addicting. The crust is perfect nice golden brown, the dough is awesome, nice moist and fluffy dough cooked even all around, and the tomato sauce inside is delicious. The filling can choose from few different ones but went with the meatballs. The fillings just as generous with the portions. In every bite had piece of meatball. Just solid solid Stromboli. The prices are super cheap under ten dollars for one. Other things on the menu but if come Four Kegs Stromboli the way too go!!!!  The place talk about personality. I have no idea the length of time but Four Kegs I know been around for long long time. It really shows in the inside. It truly defines hole in the wall. The bar area itself in super small. They have bunch of poker machines all around and even some separate away from the bar. The restaurant area is off to the side. Talk about hole in the wall. They give you plastic forks and knives. Paper plates. At the end of the day about the food for me. I just think you will find some of the best food in hole in the wall spots like Four Kegs. The Stromboli is one of them. If triple D think it worthy then worth checking out. Just don't expect to be blown away the minute you walk in.",

The sandwiches are huge and overflowing with gooey artery clogging yumminess. They didn't skimp out on the thinly sliced steak with the Philly sandwich. My mom got the Italian Stromboli and took half home (I ate it for her later like the good daughter I am!). Our waitress told us the Sicilian style pizza is great so that's on my list for next time.",

We were early for dinner (or late for lunch) so the place only had a couple of people in the restaurant section.  Service was friendly and prompt.  We placed our drink order and got those right away, then placed our dinner order;  we had the original Stromboli and the fully loaded pizza.  As we were ordering, our server also told us that we got 1/2 off the pizza because the Nascar race had just come on...excellent!  Food came out in a timely manner...relative to what we ordered.  The Stromboli was excellent, and the pizza was very good also.  Their crust is very good...I'll assume it's the same for both items.  Stromboli was filled with just the right amount of ingredients...not too few, not so many that it's overwhelming.  We have been to a few Triple D places but kept missing this one in Vegas, but we're very happy we finally got there!.",

I'd never had a Stromboli before, but do to all the rave reviews online I made sure to order the Original Stromboli with a marinara dipping sauce and a side salad.  It was great!  It wasn't too greasy but was packed with various meats (salami, ham, sausage, pepperoni, etc). Our waitress was very friendly and the prices were very low for the quality of the food we were receiving.  I'll be back!",

    "text": "Went here because Guy said it was good. Big MISTAKE!  Here's what we had:  $1.75 dinner salad - all wet half head iceberg ($.50 extra for ranch) $12.99 steak and shrimp - massacred new york steak, ordered medium, came out rare and was still dry. Sent it back and they microwaved it to well done. Beer battered shrimp. Everything tasteless. $15.99 large pizza - pretty good, nice sauce, good amount of toppings, overall acceptable. $7.99 chicken wings - basic order wings, hot sauce, ranch. Okay. $16.99 bbq ribs - sold as hickory smoked but there was nothing smoked about them (unless the cigarette smoking line cook counts?) They're baked and slathered with salty sauce. Side of cajun fries, not what you think, fries coated in hot sauce, huh? Weird thought, tastes yuck.  $3.99 kids grilled cheese and fries - better than the steak.   Now, you walk into this place in a desolate area of north vegas, about fifteen minutes on freeway from strip, and the smell of old grease is over powering. The place reminded me of county jail with glass walls separating the \"dining room\" from the bar. You would think with all the good publicity from Guy that they would have made some improvements, but, no.   I wouldn't eat here again  Think nostalgia went more into the triple d pick than the food.",

Located about 15 minutes off the strip, this little restaurant/bar is a True dive.  One door puts you in the middle of a smoke-filled bar, and another leads you to the dining area.  I was a little skeptical at first, but glad I decided to stay.  Husband and I (well more like I) couldn't decide, so we ordered two small bolis.  We went with the Original Boli and the Turkey and Swiss Boli.  Holy freaking yum!  I don't know which I prefer, so in the few times we've been back, we order both.  There's always a little leftover to take back to the hotel for a snack later.  I definitely think this place is worth the drive off strip.  PS..the old ladies working there are super nice as well.",

    "text": "\"The original sports bar and restaurant\"? If by \"original\" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.  Beer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.  Overall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food.",

Those who are not from Texas and have no clue what shiner bock is need to head over to the 4 kegs and try it, words alone can not explain my enthusiasm.

    "text": "Made it a point to go here knowing that it was on Triple D, with Guy's suggestion to try the stromboli. We ordered the veggie regular-sized and the antipasto salad. Both were pretty eh. I guess you can't expect much at a True dive bar with a smokey mini-casino area to boot.   The antipasto salad was all ice berg lettuce, canned olives and mushrooms, shredded part-skim mozzarella, celery sticks and pepperoncini. Nothing memorable at all. The stromboli was a little better, but not by much. It had marinara sauce, green bell peppers, onions, olives, mushrooms and cheese. The crust was sorta that oily, crispy dough from pizza hut, which I kinda liked since I haven't had pizza hut in maybe 10+ years. The filling was mediocre. Maybe we woulda done better with a meat-filled stromboli. I'm definitely not impressed.",

They are as good as others have mentioned, including that Guy guy. I will not rate any of their other foods, because the first time we went there was for that Stromboli and since it is the only time we go in (once or twice a year) it is the only thing we will order. Simply DELICIOUS!  Why do so many people seem to base their reviews on strictly the ambiance, or lack of in THEIR opinion, like Emilie? So the place, in some people's minds, is a dump. Who cares, if you are looking for good eats? Sure, I would probably not go there late at night unarmed, mainly because it seems like a ghetto surrounds the place (must be why I heard they lock the doors then and let you in after they size you up), but I feel fairly safe during the daylight hours - LOL. I just don't get it...  Oh, and BTW (if it matters) - we think the staff is friendly and probably proud of their interior motif! In \"my world\" I would call this place \"edgy (aka trendy)\" - HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...",

If they had left the meat out an hour longer, they could had sold it as jerky.  To be fair, the others in the group had Philly steak sandwiches and one had a Stromboli.  The Philly's looked great and everyone liked them (I wish they would have used that meat in the french dip, it looked moist). The Stromboli was also liked by the person having it.  The service was good, staff very attentive. Two stars for that, they owe me stars for the  sandwich.  If I go there again I will definitely order something else, I can't get over how bad the french dip was. But, I doubt I will go there again.",

Came with a 13 year old and sat in the area partitioned from glass. We all tried the strombolis, two originals and a beef and cheddar.  Beer was cheap, with $3 Killians on tap. Our food was a little slow getting to us, but there was a wedding reception that day (what a novel idea).  Strombolis had a nice crusty exterior and tasted great with the sauces they provided: marinara for the originals and barbecue for the BnC.  I would definitely come again to try out more varieties of strombolis and the pizza.",

There is no hoopla or marching bands. Just a large strip mall in the middle of the desert with a lot of other businesses trying to get by. Park in front and see that there are no windows and like three doors to choose from. Pick the middle one and enter right into the bar and wondering if I am in the right place... Anyway, make my way around back and get seated. This is a tiny place and a bit of a maze but all the more charming i guess...  Service here was incredible and the food even better. Had great help in choosing wasn't disappointed in the Original and the Beef and Cheddar. Wish I could have sampled everything but this alone was worth the trek in the hot Las Vegas sun...  There is nothing else to add except that their stromboli is perfection or to quote Guy... \"money.\"",

It was about 10 miles from where we were on the strip, and the drive was worth it.  Our waitress was very nice and sweet.  She recommended the Stromboli and the Philly Cheese steak.  Coming from Chicago, its very hard to find anyone else's pizza-like food to be great.  While I will say the Stromboli was very very good, I think their Philly was very memorable, and enough for two people to eat.

Walked in and just a wierd setup for the bar and resturant.  We walked around to the dining room and found a seat right away.  Our waitress was nice, attentive, yet somewhat odd.  Thats normal in some of those dive bars/resturants so no deduct for that.    Both of us ordered beer and my friend got his in the mug.  The waitress said it was suppose to be more frosty than it was but as long as its cold beer its good.  So much stuff to order on the menu but I was craving a burger so I ordered the western bacon cheeseburger.  My friend ordered the meatball sandwhich.  Everyone around us seem to be enjoying the food so we were excited to eat it up!!  Lets just say it was pure disappointment.  My burger was suppose to be medium, well it was well done.  It was so dry and flavorless.  The bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it.  My friends meatball sandwhich was cold.  He only ate half of it because of that reason.  We paid for our food and headed out.  I probably wouldnt check this place out again.  It just didn't leave a good taste in our mouths.  I am all about some good dive, grease food, but this just wasn't the place.",

Four Kegs has a handful of tiny, 1990's era TVs, one of which is the CCTV of the friggin parking lot. Isn't watching sports on larger TVs more fun? Isn't part of being a sports bar actually watching sports? The bar is fully encased in glass, as they want to separate the restaurant from the dirty, smoking people. Do people enjoy drinking in a fish bowl? Don't come if you're claustrophobic (and you might become one before you leave). There are very limited bar stools, all occupied by old men when I was there. No other seating options -- they have one high-top bar table, then a scattering of seats at the video poker machines.   I'll give it two stars because brews are $3 bones and the bartender was sweet.

As usual, this place did NOT disappoint.

If I keep coming back almost every time I'm  in town and I love the food, they have to be 5 stars!  I ALWAYS get the Stromboli. I've had other things like the Wings, which were excellent. But, I can't not get the Stromboli too .  The Original is my favorite. The crust is always perfect, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. The filling is bursting with balanced flavor.   I really like the meatball too, but the Original has the most complex flavors.   And, the service and people are great. Last time I was in for take-out, I sat at the bar, had a Killian's Irish Red in an ice cold mug, and talked with the owner Mario until my Stromboli was ready. He's a great guy!    I'll be back. See you in January, Mario!  I'm sure you'll be behind the bar making customers happy.",

    "text": "So my sister recommended trying their stromboli since her classmates have said nothing but good things about it, plus Guy Fieri made the trip out there for his Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives show. Turns out Mr. Fieri knew what was up with that place.   Let me start off by saying that if you're trying to eat here and you think its close to the strip, you couldn't be more wrong haha. It's allllllll the way toward north Las Vegas out in the cuts. It's right off the freeway though, if that helps. If you can get past the appearance of the place, then you're good to go.  When you walk in, its basically a small casino and bar with a few TVs blaring different sports games. Yep, total dive bar status. The dining area is in the back, and surprisingly the staff here are pretty nice. The dining room was close to empty, even though we showed up at 10 in the evening. My sister and I split a large classic stromboli while my cousin got the half turkey and swiss stromboli. It actually took awhile for our food to come out, but it was worth the damn wait. Something about the bread/crust made the stromboli delicious, beside the fact that the ham, cheese, pepperoni, and sausage made it good enough as is. Yeah, the bread was definitely what made the stromboli. Word of advice: ask for a side of ranch to go with your stromboli and you won't regret it. Well maybe you will because you may feel more gross afterwards, but the combination of those two are amazing.   Worth the drive, worth the wait. Like I said, just try to get over the appearance of the place and it'll be fine.",

He has to call in some senile, toothless woman to take your order. She will come back to you several times, asking you what you ordered, as she didn't remember. Then, she served it in styrofoam containers. She should have just thrown the crap away before she gave it to me. The stromboli is disgusting. The whole thing is disgusting.

While flipping through the channels the good old Food Network pops up and I see my favorite show, Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives, while half watching the show and checking up on e-mail I hear something about Las Vegas and a place where the host spent many a moon at during his youth.  So as I'm watch'n them make up a Stromboli my mouth is totally watering, once the show is over, I picked up the cell phone to give my parent's a jingle.  After getting all the details on directions and address and my explanation that this place could be a total \"dive\", I mean it's located in a strip-mall, they trekked over to see what this place was all about.  As they walked in the door they were greeted by a happy-go-lucky gentleman who said right away, \"Oh, you must have seen us on the Food Channel!\"  They nodded in agreement and their new best friend Mario led them to the small-ish dinning room toward the back of the \"casinodivebarrestaurant\" much to their delight the \"back\" of the bar was packed with people, an old wives tale my mom believes that if there are plenty of \"locals\" the food must be good.  As Mario cleared a small table for my parent's he continued to entertain/chat with them, he even cut off the football game on the TV's to turn on a VCR recording of the Food Channel episode where they were featured!  Much to the chagrin of some of the \"regulars\".  My mom had the buffalo wings, I'll preface to say she often drinks Tabasco instead of coffee sometimes in the AM.   Well, after munch'n on the wings, even she had to admit to my dad they were a bit \"zippy\".  My dad got worked over by some kind of sandwich to which he mentioned it was HUGE and very tasty.  Strangely there were no leftovers....  So, you might be wondering why I'm Yelp'n a place I've never stepped foot into.... Instead of getting some lame t-shirt from Vegas, I got a STROMBOLI!!!  WOW!!  Nice move parental units!!!  Even reheated in the toaster oven this bad-boy was out freaking standing!!  A very nice crust, plenty of goodies inside and it was re-born, via toaster oven, nicely even after a 2-3 hour flight from Vegas!!  The place is open 24hrs, whew, needless to say, it's on my \"todo\" list the next time I'm in town!!",

First of all, the Stromboli's are off the hook.  I didn't get the chance to try anything else since our party mostly got the Original Stromboli because that's what it's known for.  Next time, I'm sure i'll have more of a variety The small is still pretty big so I don't know how someone can finish a large.  I should have ordered some of the buffalo wings because when the waitress was passing by with a tray of wings to serve to another table, my mouth started to water.    I don't think they see too many minorities because when we walked in, all the patrons looked up and stared.  What's worse was that the final game of the Little League World Series (Chula Vista, CA vs. Taiwan) was playing on the projector and they might have thought we were going to route against the US.  But once we started cheering for Chula Vista, they warmed up to us, haha.",

Maybe it's \"good\" when you are on a moderate to heavy state of lubrication. The boli came out and the cheese was not melted and the dough was doughy. Sent it back and they just threw it under the salamander, which if you know how these work, it basically burned the top and didn't really do anything else, like solve the problem of unmelted cheese and uncooked dough. Ordered a side of ranch to help choke it down and they charged $0.50. That in and of itself is perry. Since the boli didn't come with marinara the least they can do is not charge for the ranch unless I'm asking for 20 of them or something. I now remember why I haven't been here for a couple years. I wish yelp would have a personal memo section for restaurants so I can make notes for places I like and dislike.",

As I ventured in we were greeted in a real friendly manner and the place lightened up!    The optimum word \"Stromboli\" don't leave without ordering it.  What is a Stromboli?  A luscious dough baked to perfection with a filling of choice inside.  I recommend the original or the turkey and cheese.  the original has 3 types of meat cheese and sauce.  There are sides you can get which are same ole stuff.  OK my mouth is watering writing about it, so I need not go into more of a description.  Go and try it they are open 24/7 except Christmas and I think there is a half of eat in the wee morning hours.  The Owner is very friendly and hospitable!  CHECK IT OUT!",

    "text": "Heard about this divey little joint located on the outskirts of the Vegas strip from a friend of mine. Anticipating what he described as fried mac and cheese goodness we made our way over to ole Four Kegs. As a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place to eat.  The atmosphere here is definitely diner-y and very dive-y, but not a problem. Although, smoking is permitted in one section of the bar, giving it that extra touch of dive. A plus is that the bathrooms were super clean. The women's anyway, the men's apparently had a floater.  The vegetarian options were slim, though I was grateful for them actually having vegetarian options. I got the veggie stromboli and shared the fried mac and cheese wedges with a friend. The rest of the bunch had pizza, various other strombolis and hot wings. I think the biggest hit was the mac and cheese wedges. Although not what I had expected (the wedges were filled with good ole blue box mac n cheese :/) they were still appetizing. My veggie stromboli on the other hand was not good. It was full of raw ass onions, FULL. There was no sauce, and when I asked for marinara poor Marge (what we felt the waitress should be named) was too busy to grab it. Bummer.  Id come back here for the unique atmosphere and maybe for those four dollar mac n cheese things, but otherwise..meh.",

    "text": "COME ON PEOPLE! SERIOUSLY? This place is mediocre at it's very best. Have any of you actually had a stromboli before? Don't get me wrong, I love a good dive bar but I would NEVER call this a sweet dive bar. If I could give it 1 1/2 stars I might but I couldn't bring myself around to giving this 2 stars. Maybe if the bar was cool I may be a bit more generous but the bar's a dump, the dining area's a dump and the food sucks. Here's my story..,  Yes, Vegas, baby, indeed. I LOVE eating at nice places but I make shit money, so after eating at a couple more expensive places my gf and I found this place that Guy 'The Tool' Fierio or whatever his name is featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives... WHY? Did he pick this out of a hat? I imagine it wasn't his decision but who the hell's decision was it?  We decided to sit in the trashy dining area because the bar was full of dirty old men. I couldn't decide between the meatball boli or the classic boli so I asked if I could get a side of meatballs. They don't do that. I have no idea why. I want to buy more things from you but I can't because it's not on the menu. You have meatballs but I can't buy them unless they're in a stromboli. Whatever. I'll go with the classic and I will live to fight another day. My sexy ass, hot chihauha momma got a club sandy with fries and we got stuffed jalepeno poppers. After 15 mins we started to wonder if our poppers fell victim to an incompetent waitress. She was nice but brought out 'entrees' out after 20 mins then told us that she didn't remember that we ordered poppers. Oh...there they are...sitting in the window. At least we got them, I guess?  My gf's fries were cold, the meat in her sandy was dry and the poppers were whatever. I took one bite of my boli and asked for a box. It was piss poor. They cut it weird, the bread was hard, not crispy but hard for some reason, the cheese was.., weird? And the marinara was bland and tasteless. We packed it up, left a couple bucks tip and headed east to try Lotus of Siam. We're literally waiting in the parking lot for them to open now so we can get a real meal. Review to come. Stay tuned you fat ol' fattys.",

    "text": "Stopped by here years ago after I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, and decided to go back for a second time this past Saturday.  It was as good as I remember.  We split a stromboli and an order of wings.  First of all the stromboli was excellent. The dough is crispy on the outside but tender and pillow soft on the inside.  We order the original which came with a variety of Italian meats.  The meats and sauce are fine, but the dough is what makes this stromboli the best I've ever had.  Once it cooled down from molten hot we devoured it in about 5 minutes.  The wings were also fried to a crispy golden brown and tossed with their wing sauce.  The sauce was a basic buffalo sauce you can find at just about any place serving wings.  The sauce was good, but we ordered medium since the wife does not like her wings too spicy.  Next time I'm there, I'll have to try out their hotter sauces. Overall the wings are good and I'd recommend them to anyone that is at Four Kegs and in the mood for wings.  However, the stromboli is something I would go out of my way to get.",

The 3 decade old carpet saves all of the years past odors. We were served but an absolutely charming older Asian woman. We loved her. But as the place got busier, the charm level fell. Took a good 10 min to pick up my card to pay the bill. That's really one of my biggest pet peeves while dining.  And the beer selection....I get it, it's a hole in the wall. But can you at least carry Sierra Nevada? Heineken is never an acceptable \"good\" beer option.  The food is great though. Too bad they share any association with Guy Fieri. That dude is beyond irritating.",

The pizza used to be almost decadent; fluffy yet crispy crust, delicious gooey cheese and scrumptious tomato sauce. The last time I visited, things seem to have taken a change for the worst. The crust was dense, the tomato sauce flavorless, and the cheese almost tasted like a cheap imitation. Even the mozzarella sticks (which were always my favorite) seemed off. I really hope it was a one-time fluke and that the next time I visit the food will be restored to its former self.",

They also have some good lunch specials. Prices are decent and portions are big.   PROS: -Pizza: It's so yummy and has a good sauce to cheese ratio. I always get it with pepperoni and jalapenos and I love that their jalapenos are spicy, not like many other places where they taste tangy but have no kick at all.  -Stromboli: Generously stuffed, pretty big in size and delicious.  -Buffalo wings: Perfectly cooked, crispy and covered in awesome buffalo sauce. Nothing worse than dry buffalo wings, but you won't have that problem here!  -Philly Cheesesteak: Another hit. Big with plenty of meat and lots of melted cheese.  -Fries: Thick, hot and crispy. Perfect!  CONS: -It's a little out of the way and in a weird neighborhood.  -They don't have a hostess stand so when you walk in it can be somewhat confusing if it's your first time. It's worse if it's busy because the waitresses are occupied so you end up just standing in the middle of the dining room or walking around not really sure where to sit or who to ask for a table. Once they notice you though, they're pretty good at seating you right away, it's just awkward for the first few minutes. Just thought I'd mention that. haha!",

The original stromboli that everyone raves about- didn't impress us that much.  If you live in a major city, you can find a stromboli in your home town just like it and in many cases - better.  We did like the dough, which is a huge part of any stromboli.  It's nice and browned, with a buttery flavor to it.  Other than that we were not impressed with the fillings here.  It was mostly an average quality black forrest ham, although there were supposed to be pepperoni and salami in there as well.  No other flavor really stood out.  Black Forrest ham isn't an italian meat, not sure why they are using it here when you have so many great Italian cold cuts to chose from.  The stromboli also could have had more cheese and marinara sauce.  Only 3 stars. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#aHBeyIiUwWA0g3ATNPnR5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/four...</a>  If you are going to come here make sure you get the Meatball Boli.  Four Kegs meatballs are very tasty.  Surrounded by the excellent golden buttery crust, this one was a winner.  We ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip in and I suggest you do as well.  It's not an amazing sauce, but I found a little dip went a long way.  It could have used a few more meatballs in this boil as well, especially since we were sharing.  4.5 stars for the Meatball Stromboli.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#xhW180LRrXist_kfJBrl-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/four...</a>  My wife rocked the boat and got the Chicken Philly.  I wanted to try the Philly cheese steak since a few people have raved about it on yelp.  But she loves a good a chicken philly, unfortunately this one was just kind of average with green peppers and onions.  Nothing too remarkable about it and it made her wonder why we drove here.  Also the potato salad was very sweet and blah. 3 stars.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-kegs-sports-bar-las-vegas?select=dJ5C1t4So4ZeWE3FDocWKQ#m47QUO5PiUWFKIVpjdKciA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/four...</a>  My daughter had some kind of fried mac 'n cheese nuggets.  Yuck!  If I never ate one of those again it would be ok with me.   It was clearly Kraft Mac -n Cheese balled up, breaded and deep fried.  Her fries were very uninspired as well.  Based on what we tried, I found Four Kegs to be a one trick pony with the Meatball Boli.  Perhaps pizza is good here, since they have a good dough and seem to know what to do with it.  I'd say Four Kegs is best for locals only.",

Most of the food is pretty good, but most especially the Stromboli. The turkey and Swiss, as well as the beef and cheddar are my favorites. The chicken wings are also amazing there. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the sandwiches that I've tried, which is why I've knocked it down to four stars. I pretty much only order Stromboli or wings, despite having tried other things on the menu.",

Beyond that...it was a TOTAL dive. Stay away!!!",

    "text": "Found this hidden gem via other yelp reviews and it lived up to the expectations and more! The bolis are as delicious as promised and the lunch cheese steak special was a fantastic deal (Included a soad/tea and fries for about 7 bucks) . The dough on the bolis is just heaven. You can taste the homemade authenticity and care that goes into the preparation of each boli. Four Kegs is a bit of a dive, with only about ten tables but with food like this you will definitely want to venture away from the buffets and pricey fare of the Strip.  Equally as amazing as the food was the cheery and friendly service we received from Kelly. She was sweet, knowledgeable,  helpful and fun! She made the experience even better by cracking jokes and just being relatable and friendly.  We left feeling like friends and definitely will be back next time we're visiting Vegas. I couldn't recommend this joint any more highly if you're looking for great food, reasonable prices, amazing service and a Cheers-like feeling in the heart of Sin City.  Kelly rocks!! Go visit her and enjoy some amazing food while you're at it!   Side note: a lot of people have been confused by the directions/location. We saw a sign for Four Kegs near a vacant McDonald's building and were a bit confused at first but with just a quick spin around the parking lot we found it with no problems.",

The deep dish pizza and chicken tenders were also very good.  The food is definitely 5-star, but the ambience is only 3-star, so I give it a total of 4 stars.",

There's a bar in the front and the restaurant in the back.   We got there around 5 PM on a Saturday. There was one other table when we got there,  They left and one other table came in after we ordered.  The service was pretty good, but that might have been because the place was empty. There seemed to be a little confusion in the kitchen, but our order came out fairly quickly and it was correct.   We split a order of mac-'n-cheese wedges and a larger originlal Stromboli.  The mac-'n-cheese wedges were ok. It tasted like out of the box mac-'n-cheese, coated in batter and deep fried. It was interesting, but probably something i would not order again.    The star of the show was the Stromboli. The dough/crust was excellent. Definitely fresh and made from scratch.  The large was perfect for my wife and I. This was my first Stromboli, so I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one.  I don't know how this stacks up to other, but I will say it was very good. If we lived in the area, we would probably go back.",

Since then, this is a place I take my brothers to when they visit.  The Stromboli's are amazing!  My personal fave is the Turkey and Swiss.  That cheesy swiss is so good I can't enough so I like to order one to go so I have some the next day.  There are two other things that are a 'must have' when I go to Four Kegs, besides beer. The Cajun Fries (which seem more like Buffalo Wing Fries) and the Fried Mac n' Cheese.  I know that Fried Mac n' Cheese is more of a thing these days but this was the first place I had ever tried it and in my mind, it is the best!  Those little triangles are perfectly fried and the Mac n' Cheese is so cheesy and delicious I could eat a couple of orders by myself.  It's perfection (when I'm not counting calories)!  The drive from my house to Four Kegs is a bit of a distance but it is always worth it.  I have never been disappointed nor has anyone I have taken there.",

And we had kids with us.  i was surprised when the waitress (same as before), gave the kids menus with a cup of crayons, and a 20 questions game...FUN!  the kids had more fun with their simple, color the picture, tic tac toe menu here than they do at places like i hop, olive garden, etc.  those menus are BUSY beyond recognition, if you ask me.  we did order other things, but i have to warn  you that the appetizer of that day were scallop skewers.  please pass on that.  it was ok, but evidently this isnt the place for seafood.   and i came here the same time i did as my other visit, only a different day, but the prices were not half off..can someone PLEASE clarify when the happy hour is...well, maybe ill just call and ask myself.   so with the minor scallop debacle, i still rate this 4 star...",

After a 45 minute wait the first  of five strombolis  made it to our table--all the strombolis arrived at different times (5-10 minutes apart). Very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat. One stromboli never made it to the table, we had to flag down our medicated waitress to check on the order (which she forgot to put in). Our waitress also forgot to put in our appetizer order--we reminded her and it came after the meal.   The one forgotten stromboli finally made it to our table AFTER everyone completed their meals, and it was ICE-COLD in the middle.   The manager never compensated us or apologized for THEIR screw-ups. Very disappointing.  Guy Fieri should be ashamed of himself for highlighting this dive on TV, he lost a lot of credibility with all of us.

Don't be turned off by their location either; Vegas simply grew up around 4 Kegs.   There is a full bar and several video slot machines. The dining rooms are partitioned by glass to keep the smoke out, which is a plus. The large dining room has a physical HD Projector showing whatever sporting event is on, while the smaller TV's flanked to the left and right show alternative games. The smaller dining room has three TV's.   I've been coming here for years to get my fix for Pizza and Calzones and I'm averaging about every 2-3 weeks. It seriously doesn't get much better than this.

The food is the weakest I've ever had at a triple d joint but at least the staff was rude & the food was served ABSURDLY H O T! But the order of onions was LITERALLY four rings making it the smallest order I've ever seen served at any food establishment. Go elsewhere. The other pizza joint recommended in Vegas by Guy - Naked pizza ROCKS!",

Friendly locals. Again, old school dive bar/sports bar atmosphere. They also have a separate dining room if you want it a little quieter. Tv's still showing games in that area slso. We normally stay on Freemont Street and I must say, it took only 6 or 7 minutes from our hotel. Definitely worth the short drive!",

    "text": "Terrible. I'm actually disappointed in Guy Fieri.  He puts this dump (or I suppose a True dive) on the map.  But the food isn't good.  And the service is atrocious.    I've been here about a dozen times.  Never had any real complaints because my expectations are low.  Decent bar food in an old dive bar where they serve your food on cheap styrofoam plates.   Tonight was the last time we'll give this place a dime of our money.  Late night baseball game and the kids are hungry.  It's 9:45pm and Four Kegs is on the way home for us.    We order four large Meatball Bolis with four sides of marinara sauce.  We also order some wings and fries.    The wings and fries were fine.  Not so much for their signature menu item... the Stromboli.   I put a slice on my plate and put some of the marinara on top.  I take a bite and it's cold.  I'm talking straight out of the fridge cold.    Our server was sweet.  Very sweet.  I mention it to her and she apologizes.  She tells me that she's bringing a new one.    Five minutes later, she brings out a new side of marinara sauce in a small styrofoam bowl... and it's still cold.    She apologizes and says that the kitchen is going to make a new batch.    She brings out the new sides of marinara and it's just the same ones we sent back, but they microwaved it.  How do we know?  Because the styrofoam bowl is now slightly fried and warp.  Lol.  To make the dining experience worse...  the meatballs inside the Stromboli is cold.  Ice cold.  And the cheese around it isn't even melted.    At this point, I don't want to send any food back and risk the possibility that the cooks will spit in my food.  I call the server over and tell her that the bolis are cold.  I tell her we will just take the food home and microwave it.   She apologizes about 20 times.  I feel bad because it's not her fault.  It's the idiots in the kitchen.... or it's the owner who has no oversight on quality control.    But I suppose who cares.  The show was on TV... endorsed by Guy Fieri.  They'll do fine.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Fried Vegetable Basket - Mushrooms, Zucchini Chips and Cauliflower with Cheese Sauce and Ranch Cajun Fries with Ranch Small Pepperoni and Cheese Sicilian Pizza Small Original Stromboli with Pepperoni, Sausage, Ham, Cheese, Marinara Spumoni Cake Chocolate Cake  Self proclaimed as Las Vegas \"Original Sports Bar and Restaurant,\" an appearance on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives making the space at 276 North Jones Boulevard more famous than it might be otherwise, The Four Kegs...or Four Kegs Sports Bar...or Four Kegs Sports Pub is one of those old-school spots that has maintained a steady clientele in a city built on transiency, some business in the area spontaneously providing an impetus to stop in and find out why.   Serving consistently since 1977 and one of a handful of 24/7 Gaming Joints with the foresight to partition off the dining room from Cigarettes and Video Poker to preserve the lungs of diners including those under 21-years of age, The Four Kegs features several sections including a large group area as well as tables along a narrow hallway, the area designated as \"Dining Room\" juxtaposing the kitchen featuring several televisions tuned to sports plus some comfy, broken-in booths.  Pleasant in service, a few Four Kegs veterans coaching a younger woman who was clearly new but handling several tables of regulars like an old pro, it was from a menu of Bar Food classics that decisions were debated, an eventual order of six items and a Soft Drink tallying $50 after tax and tip - not cheap, but not a bad value considering the portions served.  Not upscale in any way, the overhead soundtrack dating back to Ace of Base and Journey as the NBA captured the attention of many, it was with a basket of Fried Vegetable plus Fries rolled in Hot Sauce that the meal got started, the latter a thick Steak-cut that was unfortunately somewhat flaccid while the not-technically-a-vegetable Mushrooms highlighted a basket that was mostly an oily delivery mechanism for bottled Ranch.  Edible, though not inspired, course two was perhaps a better way to see what the Sports Bar kitchen was capable of, a six-slice rectangle of \"Sicilian\" Pizza well-topped but falling short in terms of Crust as a lack of leavening left all but the outside edge soggy, the DDD-revered Original Stromboli a much better use for the Dough as a slighter amount of Mozzarella and tangy Marinara allowed the $9.95 'Sandwich' to bake up crispy and golden brown.  Not making any of their Desserts in-house, the waitress keeping cards close to her chest when asked which local Bakery supplies the goods, thin slices of two Cakes were chosen with Cheesecake saved for another time, the Chocolate actually incredibly rich beneath thick Ganache while the four-layer Spumoni went all-in with a thin layer of Frosting plus a robust Graham Cracker surrounding three lightly sweetened Ice Creams plus a layer of Chocolate.  *** Fair-to-Middling in a city with no lack of 24/7 dining, sports and gambling, The Four Kegs is a worthwhile visit for those in the area looking for something to eat at any hour of the day, though with the development of places like Naked City Tavern or even The Sporting Life and Born and Raised it most certainly is not any sort of 'destination.'",

I like the crust on this slightly like a deep dish dough buttery, crispy and delicious.  Stuffed with ham, pepperoni, salami, sausage and mozzarella. I recommend getting the marinara on the side for an up charge. You will not be disappointed if you order this dish. Come after midnight until 8am and you get big discounts.  The Philly cheese steak was awesome!. Loaded with thin sliced beef griddle with just the right amount char to add great flavor, and peppers, onions, mushrooms, and provolone. The bread really made this sandwich a homerun. The fries were good, but a little underdone. A nice thick steak cut but could have been a little crispier.  The beans tasted like baked out of can style. I don't think Guy Fieri came here for this dish.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "After watching football at a locals bar in Las Vegas, we decided to try another local bar we found on Yelp. This bar was on the show Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives.   From the outside, the sports bar looks huge! I was really disappointed with the lack of big TV's here and the way they were laid out.  Upon entering there was a small bar area with limited seating. There was also an area which seemed like restaurant seating and then another room that you could call the banquet room. Anyway, the bar area was packed. So the hostess took us to the banquet room area which had about 4 TV's (I think). We couldn't see all the games so the hostess said she could take us to a different area. It had the same issues, you couldn't view all the TV's and they were small TV's  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try the fried pickles and original stromboli. The pickles and stromboli were good but nothing that would give you that \"wow\" factor. My friends ordered the wings that were on special. Those too were good but nothing spectacular.  I must say that we did see the pizzas here and they looked really good!  Having the words \"Sport Bar\" in your restaurant name, one would  think they would have tons of big flat screens. Not Here! Won't come back for that reason.",

It looks like a dive bar with bar-top gaming, but don't be bashful - walk right in and pick any table because the service is always excellent and the food is fantastic. The Strombolis are the signature dish and are even on the lunch special every Wednesday. We love to sneak away for a lunch break, or take out-of-towners to a real local Vegas experience, or stop here during a weekend motorcycle ride. Make any excuse you need, just grab some friends and head over to Four Kegs for some of the valley's best food and service.",

Wifey and I have driven past this place countless times and kept telling ourselves, yeah, we need to check that place out.   Well, we finally did a few weeks ago after attending Big Dog's Winterfest.    The place is very easy to find.   it is right off the Jones exit.   You can't miss it.   We found a place to park pretty easily.   The place wasn't that busy for around 8 pm on a Saturday night.   We walked in and went past the bar area, through the interior doors to the dining room in back.    We we quickly greeted by an older friendly Asian lady.   We grabbed a seat and she took our drink orders pretty quickly.   We looked over the menu, but we were on a mission for one thing, Stromboli.   Our waitress brought out the drinks very quickly and we placed our orders.   I got the meatball 'boli and wifey got the standard 'boli.   Both came out in about 10 minutes which was pretty quick.   And yeah, they were awesome.   We totally enjoyed ours.   It may not look like a lot of food, but it is.   We both got to go boxes.    Overall: Food - Excellent Stromboli.  Service - Terrific Vibe - Divey Drink - it's called four kegs because they only have 4 beers on tap.   So you get what you can.    Will I be back?   Heck yeah I will.",

    "text": "Went here with a friend last night for dinner. All I can say is the food is Amazing! Had the original stromboli with ranch and marinara on the side, pepperoni pizza, and zucchini chips. Everything was delicious! So much food and it was all around $35. We even had enough for left overs for the both of us. We sat in the dining area and bypassed the bar part of it. When I first walked in I wasnt so sure of the place. It looked like a small smokey bar. Once we went thru the dining area and saw families and others packed sitting enjoying their meals I was like ok they're busy. What brought me here though was the fact that its down the street around the corner for my house and my friend mentioned Guy Fieri recommended it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives so of course being a foodie I had to check it out. I cant wait to tell everyone about it and come back! By the way the hostess was super attentive, kind, etc. I cant say enough about this place!",

Unfortunately we thought the abandoned building under the sign by Summerlin Pkwy was it so we thought it was closed for about a year....but it's not! It's actually around the side on Jones. Anyways...the Stromboli was off the hook!!! It was so good we ordered another to go!!! Ok so the place could definitely use a remodel, but we have no problem stopping in for a 'Boli. We went around 1100 AM on a Friday and there was only a couple other tables in use.",

So there were partially raw onions in the mix.  I was surprised that the veggies weren't sauteed prior to baking into Stromboli.  Waitress was fine, not overly friendly or helpful.  We are from NJ, home to amazing Italian food made by real Italians. This place doesn't even come close. Lousy atmosphere and sketchy cooks. We will never come again and certainly not recommend.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars. I would classify this place as really good bar food (I used to think PT's was good bar food, now it's just OK). Some people would call this a dive bar (it's a little dated, but isn't that part of the charm?), others would call this a locals place (like Cheers), and others might call this a sports bar/video poker bar (front smoky part). It might be all of these things, but what matters most here is the food.   My husband said he ate here 10 years ago and that it was really good. I looked this up here, and saw that Guy Fieri had this place featured on his show DDD- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, that show! After checking out the menu and seeing the reviews (STROMBOLI was mentioned many, many times), but having questions, I had almost made up my mind (hee hee).  After passing up the smoking section (the bar part) and entering the Dining Room (there are 2 parts, the bathroom is in between both parts, in the hallway, next to the big red sign reading \"DINING ROOM\"), we chose a table, except the table was reserved at 6:30, so we moved against the wall, with the trophies- there were a ton of them. Looked like there were several other groups here, and a party was taking place. There was a cake and other supplies set up underneath the TV, which had sports on.   We all ordered different items. My husband ordered the medium square pepperoni pizza, I ordered the chicken philly with mushrooms, onions, and peppers, came with steak fries, my husband's uncle ordered the steak sandwich came with steak fries, one friend ordered the chicken wings, but she didn't want fries, one friend ordered the original stromboli (this is what I wanted to order, but this one had assorted meats and I'm sure the sodium content is extremely high. WIsh they had a ham and cheese one alone). The bill was a little over $55, so the prices were reasonable. (We mostly had soft drinks and one friend had a couple beers.)   I've been craving (I'm pregnant) a really good sandwich lately, and this chicken philly was extremely satisfying. The chicken pieces (good quality) were seasoned, the cheese was melted- ooey and gooey (yum), the fixings made it a good sized sub sandwich. I only ate half because it was very filling- it was stuffed! Everyone said that my philly looked good, and I admit it was one of the best philly's I've ever had. The steak fries were ok, weren't crispy (I love crispy skin-on fries), but weren't greasy, either. I'm not too crazy about thick steak fries, probably my least favorite. What I ate, I peppered and ate with ketchup, but I had alot left over (seems like lots of restaurants give a ton of fries these days).   My husband's pizza was pretty big for an individual sized pizza, and the crust was kinda on the thick side (I prefer thin), but it looked good. I don't like pepperoni and being pregnant, I'm not supposed to have too many things with nitrates, anyway. I had a small bite of the corner of the slice, which had cheese- it was good. Because it's thick, I probably would've only eaten two slices of it. He only orders the pizza when he comes here (took some slices home). My husband's uncle's steak sandwich looked good, too, and he wasn't talking much, so I think he enjoyed it. The friend who ordered the wings, said that she only orders this whenever she comes here, and she's been coming here since she was a little girl, with her family (she also said that it looks the same just like it always did). The friend who ordered the stromboli (the 4 pc. order), said that it was good, but could've been more seasoned with herbs, and that the marinara sauce could've been warmed, it was cold. She finished it, though. She also said she'd order the chicken philly next time.  The service was pretty good- our server was nice and attentive. The server checked on us several times and offered us refills and brought us boxes, too.   Would I come here again? Heck ya! It's all about the food. Sometimes, ambiance doesn't matter, because the whole point of going out, is dining (the food, baby). I've always found that casual places are more laidback. Inexpensive really good bar food- you can't lose here. If you're a local, try it, you'll like it. If you're a tourist, come here, because it was on DDD (we found some really good places from watching the show) and then realize you'll come again the next time you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Definitely don't judge a book by its cover - and don't judge this shithole by the people who frequent here. Sketchy people drink here. I don't know what rock these people crawled out from under. Many (not all) are nasty looking with stained clothing and missing teeth. But friendly, really friendly, so if you can get past their appearance you'll be fine.  Upon entering Four Kegs you walk into a dingy bar, and entering another set of doors leads you to a dining room straight out of the 70's (or maybe 60's, what do I know?). It's separate from the bar so you can bring kids in here. The furniture is old and rickety, booths need to be reupholstered and this place definitely needs a facelift. Hell it's probably been around longer than most of you reading this have been alive.   The food - typical bar menu with lots of fried food, finger foods, burgers and sandwiches. Over the years, our kids have ordered pretty much everything off the menu, including breakfast, Overall the food is very average - nothing spectacular.  The crown jewel of this shithole is their Stromboli and square Sicilian pizza. The pizza isn't the best, but I think it's a step above the chains. I really like the crust, which compares to the crust at BJ's or Numero Uno. Not as good, but trying to be.  I'd take this over a pizza hut any day, but Broadway Pizza is way better. I've been eating it for almost 20 years now and it hasn't changed one bit.   Papa D has been eating the Stromboli here for over 30 years and swears by them. Actually I believe this was one of his hangouts in the 70's! I don't think it's all that, but he loves it so I go to keep him happy. I prefer the pizza.   You'll always have lunch available the next day as the portions are huge - the small stromboli is big enough for two people.  Diner Beware - this place is a DIVE. I've been eating here for 20 years, I'm a fan,  and yet I still cringe when I walk in the door.",

It has a separated bar area from the dining area.  Were seated immediately and watched a little March Madness.  Our waitress was a little older but very sweet.  And a great memory.  We ordered and she didn't even bother to write anything down.  We kid her about it and she said she understood what we wanted.  Everybody ordered stromboli's, as they are the specialty and the recommended choice of Guy Fieri.  My order was a veggie stromboli, hold the onions.  When the food arrived, everyone was pleased and the order was right except for one thing: our waitress noticed that they cooks had added onions to mine.  She immediately noticed this and went back and replaced my order.  i told her she could take the one back with onions, but she said they would just toss it and I could take it.  Great, my friends said they would eat it later.  So my order came right the next time, it was pretty good (not amazing, though) and we were four happy dudes.  It is worth the detour from the Strip to come here to try something different.  Nice people, decent food and ballgames on the screen.  What else could a guy want?  Oh, except that!  We are in Vegas!!!",

Luckily you are just in there for a second before you head into the restaurant.  The restaurant is dark and nicely ac'd.  Actually it's kind of cold in there.  There was a nice older lady working there and she was very pleasant.  She didn't got our order right and she was the only one working.  I ordered the stromboli.   It was loaded with cheese and the dough was crunchy but had a texture of good bread.  I would like it slightly less cheasy but that's personal prefference.  The sauce had good flavor and it's huge.  I ordered the large and I'll definitely get two meals and I'm a big eater.   I would stick with stromboli.  My friend ordered the club sandwich and it was not what I expected.  The bread was good but the ham was not the best.  I would give it a four if you stick with the stromboli and value for dollar.  I'll try some other stuff and re-review.",

A table that got seated after us got their appetizers before us. We had to ask again for our appetizers after we got our food. I ordered The Kegs Club w/ fries. The fries were cold, as was the bacon on my sandwich, which makes me assume the bacon sits pre-cooked in kitchen. They used american cheese, no option for cheddar, swiss, etc. Didn't even bother to stick the sandwich in the microwave to melt the cheese. My boyfriend ordered a stromboli, it was comparable to a calzone you would buy in a high school cafeteria. We took one bite each, & asked for boxes. We decided to get a quality meal elsewhere, and & at the very least save that food for a 2nd rate lunch for work tomorrow. The waitress brought us boxes & a plastic bag. She had trouble opening the bag up, gave up, & tossed it in my general direction while walking away.  The place was not particularly busy when we went in, I can't think of any reason other than low standards for why the food was so bad and we received barely any attention from waitress. Dont let the tv show or the other good reviews draw you in, thats how we were fooled, and led us to waste money & some of our last few hours in las vegas.",

Three members of our party had a Red Neck Turkey burger and a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, one had the Nachos,All of which were off the hook! You gotta try the Shiner Bock beer in their frosted glass which makes it a plus. All for less than $90.00! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "One opportunity I wanted to take advantage of while on vacation in Las Vegas was trying one of the restaurants I saw on Diners, Drive -Ins and Dives. My wife and I decided on Four Kegs.   Driving up to it at first glance and it's easy to see which category this place falls under: It's a dive.   But I mean that in the most positive sense of the word.   Upon entry you are greeted with a smoke smelling bar / gaming room but to my surprise and delight, the dining area is sectioned off completely by windows and doors so the smoke doesn't seep into the dining area.   You can tell this place is proud to have been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives as there are multiple pieces of Guy Fieri memorabilia on the wall, but it added a little charm to the restaurant.   As we sat down we were promptly greeted by a waitress (older, friendly lady whom I suspect has been there for quite some time). She was ale to take our entire order without writing anything down and obviously remembered it perfectly. On top of our table there were at least five other groups of people she was attending to yet it didn't affect her attitude or pace in the slightest.   We started with the fried pickle spears and the cajun fries. Both appetizers were perfect. The breading on the pickle spears was near perfection and seasoned perfectly. It was obvious they use fresh ingredients and high quality pickles. The cajun fries were steak fries (I assume freshly cut) with buffalo wing sauce an seasoning on them. Again... perfect.   I ordered the french dip. My only complaint was that the roast beef was SLIGHTLY dry but that was easily offset by the au jus. Not the best french dip but definitely in the upper echelon of french dips I have tried.   My wife ordered the fish and chips (Friday Special) and she said it was solid, but not spectacular. She still finished them off and I tried them. Good quality seasoning.   My step daughter had the wings and, on the kids menu, they wisely put the sauce on the side rather than completely dousing them. She took leftovers home and polished them off too.   Overall, combining the service, freshness and quality of all the food,this is a good four stars. If I ever return I will have to try the stromboli, which seems to get a lot of praise.",

The original Stromboli is a solid 5 stars.  I make it a point to eat here every time I am in L.V.    As for the place itself....  I have read other reviews about how seedy it is and awkward the building is.  But until you here what the owner did, one would not understand.  The Four Kegs was a bar that served food.  When Las Vegas passed the law that you could not smoke where food is served, the owner had two choices.  Either close the food section and keep the bar only or do what he did.  Thankfully, he came up with the unique design the encapsulate the bar in the center, which keeps the smoke in the center and completely away from the eating area.  Luckily for me, he came up with he design because I love the Stromboli.",

I'm not a professional chef but I do know you never freeze mushrooms.  2. The waitress did not apologize about the mushrooms. I know it's not her fault but she could have stopped by our table and apologize on behalf of the chef. Also, there was no follow up to check if we have liked the food or if we needed anything else. I myself have worked in the restaurant industry for some years so maybe I'm being a bit to harsh but at the end of the day I loved their food and I'll be coming back.",

    "text": "I can't think of a more Americanized version of an Italian dish than stromboli, so it is only appropriate that the Four Kegs, a humble sports bar, would have the best version in Vegas. After hearing about these strombolis on one of our favorite Food Network shows, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,' my husband and I decided to visit this hole in the wall. Upon entering this particular dive we were shocked at the popularity, but upon discovering that draft beer was only $2.50/pint we immediately solved the first part of the puzzle.  Next came the salad ($1.75). It was a watery mess of iceberg and iceberg, which was so bad I couldn't bring myself to finish it (and I always finish my salad). At least it was fresh? At this point, we were hoping that something redeeming could come out of the kitchen. We were then hit with the Cajun fries ($2.95), which, seeing how there was nothing Cajun about them, should have been described as vegetarian chicken wings. I love Frank's Red Hot and ranch dressing just as much as the next Mid-Westerner (I feel I can pass judgement on the use of these ingredients because my husband is from Missouri and I've spent ample time perfecting my Velveeta cheese dip making abilities) but soggy fries just don't cut the mustard.  Finally the stromboli ($8.49) arrived. Stroboli, believe it or not, is also the name of an island off the coast of Sicily, which is a noteworthy place because of its continuous and patterned volcanic eruptions over the last 20,000 years. The stromboli at the Four Kegs isn't quite as miraculous, but was an explosion of tastiness nonetheless. The exterior was crispy and browned, and the filling was appropriately cheesy, meaty, and saucy. Is it hard to make something taste good with these components? Not really, but the expertly constructed crust and price makes this dish a winner. The technique of Mario is to be commended, because he is able to thoroughly cook every bit of the crust without burning it  or leaving a trace of doughiness. This is a feat most bakers in the States would have a hard time accomplishing. We only finished half of it, but I give it a solid thumbs up.  Overall, I will label the Four Kegs as a cheap place to get a filling and above average meal, but stick with the Stromboli and beer. I promise you'll leave happy if you follow those words of advice.",

Small bite sized pieces allow you to indulge in a guilty pleasure without totally destroying your diet.  With sports everywhere, this place gets my seal of approval.

Since we were in the LV area, we couldn't resist but to stop here for their original Stromboli. It tasted just as Guy described it...the crust was crisp on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. Add ham, pepp, mozarella cheese, and marinara sauce and it's like a match made in heaven. SO GOOD!!!   This place is probably the last D on DDD...it was a total DIVE! About 10 mins from the strip, this \"sports bar\" sits in a partially desolate shopping center in a very questionable area. Luckily, it is right off the freeway for a quick getaway...if needed! :) The layout of this place is a trip...it kind of reminded me of a cul de sac of a street. You enter and you are at the cul de sac which is their bar area...on both ends there are doors leading you into their dining area which I can describe as being on the outskirts of that cul de sac. They are divided by half of a wood paneling wall on the bottom and the other half is plexi glass where you can see from either side...imagine a bank with bulletproof windows????!!! I know very strange.   The staff is really friendly and the service is A+. Our waitress said, \"Guy must have sent y'all cuz I've never seen you in my life!\" LOL! The menu was pretty extensive...pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, chili fries, pitchers of BEER, etc. The prices were very cheap for the amount of food that they serve. Overall, I would definitely come back when in the area to try the rest of their food, esp the pizza!!!",

Everyone appears to know everyone else. When we arrived, they were all coordinating a trip to Calico Jack's to see one of their regulars perform karaoke. Now, that's family.   They have a separate area for non-smokers and kids, which thrilled me, as I had entered expecting to leave laden with smoke. The non-smoking room features a huge screen for watching a game. We were greeted promptly, and service was friendly and attentive during our entire wing trip.  We ordered the fried veggie basket and an order of spicy BBQ wings, and neither were particularly noteworthy. The veggies were deeply breaded and served with ranch and a spicy honey mustard. The wings were big. I'll give them that, but the meat was not super tender. I also didn't love the sauce.   Based on my experience, I would echo the oft repeated sentiment in other reviews: stick with beer and stromboli!",

It had been awhile since I've come back to this place and as soon as I took the first bite of the Stromboli again I automatically got disappointed in myself because I have been missing out and that I know I'll probably be back too soon to eat the food again.  Recently ordered the wings and fries to go one night after work. Pretty good choice to go with and wings are pretty jumbo.",

The restaurant is located in a really bad part of town but we had a guest visiting who had seen it featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive-in's, so we gave it a shot.  The bar is separated from the restaurant so you do not have to worry about smoke. It had a very retro Mom and Pop feel to it.  Our guest said he heard raving reviews about the Stromboli so we decided to try it. When it was brought out, the outside was hot but the inside that contained the meat ice cold. We had to send it back to the kitchen.  It was an underwhelming experience.",

Four Kegs is exactly the place you want pull up a seat and lift a cold one after a day you want to forget. With the kind of everyone knows your name neighborhood vibe that's a rare find in this town this place has all the nostalgic comfort of your favorite blanket. I would have been happy had the food been merely serviceable but the burgers turned out to be the kind of perfectly cooked to order, juicy rarity that makes lowly ground beef feel like a cut of the finest steak. After 4 years in this town I finally found the holy grail burger to replace my favorite NYC joint. Michelle, our server who treated us with the all the hospitality of an old friend I might have known for 20 years assured us that the Stromboli and pizza they are famous for are equally as awesome. I cant wait to go back!",

Well instead of wings I got an overload of these Stromboli pictures that just made me forget about wings all together! So as soon as I got the chance I placed a take out order over the phone. The lady who answered was so sweet. It took about 15 min for me to get there. When I got there my order was ready. That place is super cool looking! There's a bar in the front where you can sit at. And then there are two glass doors on the left and right or the bar that lead to an actual sit down restaurant type place. Looked really busy! I must come back and enjoy a few beers with my Stromboli next time. So I ordered a large original Stromboli and it was amazing!!!!! The hype is real! It oozes with cheese, thin slices of ham, pepperoni, sausage and marinara sauce. I ordered a large so that if I loved it I'll have left overs for work or something. Well it's almost gone and I have a feeling I'll be craving it again soon! I thought that it would be like a more doughy type bread but to my surprise it has a little crispy ness to it. It is still nice and doughy and soft in the middle and the crispness adds that \"pizza crust\" feel. It literally is like eating the best pizza in the most convenient way :) yes yes yes will be back!",

Id say 2 outta 25 friends have been here everyone else were 1st timers. Listen up readers, you try and arrange 25 friends that are hungry and wanna drink like pirates to come to an off strip restaurant and you'll see how stressful it can be until they eat and drink @ an establishment that's been doing this since 1977. Wendy and Kim were exactly what is needed in this industry. They get it. They work. It's humbling cause our group is industry too. Four Kegs is one of my favorite and always will be. This place may not be for some people and I get that, it's older with the old Vegas style still shadowing but it's what's needed. Visit this place and if you gotta big group make a call like I did. Be nice. It's worth it.",

The meatball stromboli is especially huge and surprisingly great for a non-Italian restaurant.

I have been trying to find a place that could compare to a home fav, and this is it! Accompanied by extra sauce to \"dunk\" with, and the extra cold beers made it better.  The wings were good, but their sauce just taste like the bottled stuff you get at the store, no additions.   Service was good and the waitress was on top of our drinks, which is a big plus in my book.  Overall, we plan on being back within the next couple weeks : )",

    "text": "My ex boy friend and I have been coming to this place for 4 plus years. A few positive things I will say is that we have always loved the food and the pizza. We come there late because we both work late.The staff usually is always friendly and they have really nice specials for a late crowd.The neighborhood is a little iffy, but I have always pretty much felt safe because they usually keep the riff raff out.That being said you can imagine my shock and dismay when we went there last night and was treated like complete trash by one of their staff members.I believe the guys name is Shane but I'm not certain.I don't personally know this one particular guy because we usually get the heavier set guy, Rob, who is nothing but nice.I believe I have seen this guy a few times on our way to the back to enjoy their pizza when I don't want to sit at the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbar.So&s=2e02040f9b1820beef6ce864d82810388b97fc6a46724b45eba3bfafa5ba1ff2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bar.So</a> anyway at first my ex jokingly rang the boor bell more than once with a smile cause he and the bartender are usually cool...he was thinking he'd at least get a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flaugh.So&s=f0860da08cd7bc346ba6b95821bf87ac5c60312442e27b26a586433df580c9c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">laugh.So</a> someone comes on the speaker and says: \"you two wont be getting in here ringing the bell like that.\" So we patiently wait a few seconds with smiles and we still aren't being let in.I then ring the bell once again and then the door opens by this other bartender we don't normally see....he then looks at my ex and says you aren't allowed in here <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanymore.At&s=d070a49a9fe6db26bb8fa598913c5155e81b9a8cb6536c74388a5815eea8c820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anymore.At</a> first we think its a joke cause you just never know with guys and we know we have never done anything except act silly with the bell...then when my ex says, \"Really? Why not?\" the guy just unleashed in this angry fury with the foulest language I have ever heard from any employee ever telling him why he wasn't allowed in there anymore. Every other word was the f word and any and all other variation of the f word along with some other belligerent and ignorant things he could say. Apparently he was pissed off that the last time my ex was there that he only gambled 50 cents per hand or something......he accused him of scamming and on and on and on...so the two start arguing because my boyfriend then speaks up to defend himself and it keeps escalating and escalating.....I then finally try and intervene and I'm say \"Why are you speaking to him like that? And asked him who he thought he was talking to like that.  He then says it again but now putting me in it...yous aren't allowed in here anymore.  I was like, \"Dude I don't even f'ing know you, dude\".  I then go on to say that we always come there and sit in the back and order pizza...he then goes, \"Yeah, yous come in here and order your cheap f'ing pizza.\"...and blah blah blah....this of course makes zero sense to me 'cause why offer a special if you are going to accuse your patrons of being cheap when they order it....then I asked if he was the manager...he then lied and said yes....my ex after giving him the finger several times in his face and saying \"F*** off\" asked, \"Are you the owner?\" Again he lied and said yes. I know one of the the owner's names is Mario. So, without warning this guy then starts shutting the door with me standing in the doorway. I mean he is literally hitting me with this door to close it. I could have been injured and for what? I am seriously considering pressing battery charges against this guy because of it.You don't go and behave this way and then you try and assault me with a door? Here's the thing: you have the right to tell us we are banned from your property and for what reasons, but you certainly don't come off talking to people in such a belligerent way unprovoked. We just came there for pizza after working, and if there was a problem then you address it in a calm matter, not like that. And to go as far as trying to close me in a door. It wasn't as if we were trying to force our way in. I was just standing there during the argument this guy started from the moment he opened the door and went off. All of this should be on camera if the establishment tapes what goes on. I can't imagine having an employee that talks to and treats patrons this way. Now I can understand if we came in there messing with other patrons and acting like complete fools, but we didn't. To be that mad cause someone didn't play $1.25 per hand the last time they were in there?  Wow...and oh, one last thing. He tried to involve the other bartender by yelling \"Such and such, doesn't he always bring his cheap ass in here and do this?\"  Well, the bartender who knows us and is always friendly wouldn't even answer. He just looked over and you could tell he wanted no parts of this behavior. Anyway, of course, I will never set foot in that place ever again and I'll be sure to let all of my friends and family about this. Why spend your money at a place where employees are allowed to behave in such a way?  As far as battery charges.I don't know. I'm still seriously considering it.  I don't take too kindly to being assaulted by doors.",

    "text": "I go back and forth between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. They have been around Vegas as long as I can remember, and got famous a few years back after being featured on Triple D. It's a small bar with a small dining area in the back. They are pretty welcoming, but you can tell they have their regulars. They are known for their pizza and strombolis. Pizza is thick buffalo style, pretty good. Not too doughy. I prefer it with less toppings to enjoy the actual pizza. The strombolis are made with fresh ingredients but to me seem pretty average. I ordered the Cajun fries, buffalo spicy with a smell of vinegar. Yum. All of their salad dressings are home made and the blue cheese is thick and has red wine vinegar in it. I'm still undecided about it.  The burgers are good, salad was average. Chili seemed like it was straight from a can with fresh cheese and onions on top. Hot link was a good quality meat.  Not everything here is fresh, for sure some frozen appetizers and a few corners cut, but OVERALL you'll get decent food if you know what to order.  Oh and it was fun pissing off the cowboys fans during the game too :) gotta love a place that you can watch the game at!",

    "text": "Pros: ranch, bread dough recipe, marinara, alcohol prices, multiple flat screens for sports Cons: turkey meat, atmosphere Recommend to friends and family: NO  I heard about this place on the show Diners, Driveins, and Dives.  This establishment is definitely a DIVE and the food I tried was on par for that category.  My girlfriend and I ate at the bar (there is seating seperate from the bar with booths).  We asked the bartender what patrons ordered the most and what she recommended.  Which led is to try the turkey and swiss stromboli with a side of marinara sauce, macaroni and cheese potato wedges (came with a side of ranch) and the BBQ chicken tenders (came with 2 celery sticks and a side of ranch).   Best item to worst: ranch dressing, macaroni and cheese wedges, chicken tenders, and turkey swiss stromboli.  Stromboli: The stromboli bread was tasty, the swiss cheese good, but the turkey meat was horrible.  The turkey tasted like the cheap Budig sandwich meat.  The pizza bread dough and marinara was so good which leads me to believe that the Sicilian pizza would be a better choice or the original stromboli (I do not eat pork so that was a no go to try.) Macaroni and cheese potato wedges: palatable bar food Chicken fingers: typical frozen flat style bar chicken tender. Ranch and celery: the ranch was \"on point\" above average (better than Buffalo Wild Wings' ranch) and at least the celery was fresh. Atmosphere: We sat at the bar which was enclosed with glass partitions (smokey fish bowl) separate from the \"family friendly\" dining area and banquet room.  There is non gaming bar seating available and a separate area to the side of the bar for gaming customers.  The staff was  attentive and pleasant in typical dive bar fashion (By pleasant I mean authentic but not an over the top artificial attempt to be nice) Honestly, I would not recommend this bar to friends or family unless they happen to be on that side of town and want to watch a football game (Dallas Cowboy Fan Bar according to a decal on the bar mirror) or want a moderately priced drink for around $6 (grey goose and cranberry) The local dive bar that I frequent is Rum Runner.  In comparison it was on par.  Dive bars are described as an informal, unglamorous, bar for local residents to drink and decompress with the convenience of mediocre food.   This fits the bill.  ***Disclaimer: I went here on my low carb cheat day for a snack and had high dive bar food expectations since Guy Fieri reviewed this place.",

My husband is from the east coast and has been missing some of his east coast favorites, Stromboli, pizza etc. Saw an episode on diners, drive ins and dives and had to go. It is an odd little place, bar in the front, dining in the back and on the side lounge areas. Wait staff is very friendly, totally makes the place...the food was good, however if you ask my husband, he thinks the Stromboli is the best in town. I gave it 4 stars for hubby's sake but to me I think 3 stars is sufficient. I think for a late night bar run with some eats it is a perfect spot ...It is good bar food.",

It took 20 minutes for us to get our food. It wasn't that bad tbh. At least she made sure it was correct! She apologized many times and even comped us on some drinks!

The first unexpected/disturbing experience is arriving at the Four Kegs sign you saw from the freeway and discovering an abandoned building next to the sign enclosed in a chain link fence in a scary neighborhood.  Not to worry, the Four Kegs is just on the other side of the parking lot.  There tend to be disturbing (or disturbed) individuals in the parking lot so hurry inside.    Once inside, you will be instantly disoriented by the odd shape of the room, an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke, and a dozen or so of the individuals your mother warned you about.  Hang a quick left and go through the glass door by the takeout counter.  You will instantly be comforted by the fresh air and friendly wait staff.    You'll find yourself in another odd shaped dining room reminiscent of Talladega Nights.  Strap on a Ricky Bobby smile and order one of the 4 draft beer choices - thus the name Four Kegs.  Finally order your Strombolli, enjoy your beer, be thankful for the safety of the dining room and plan your eventually escape back through the bar and parking lot.  One thing you will not be disturbed by is the Strombolli - delicious.  Some may be surprised that you will be eating it off of styrofoam plates but at least the utensils are metal.  In the words of Nelson Mandella, \"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\". I'm guessing Mr. Mandela would be down for a Boli.",

We started with the scampi wings. Not too hard to make. The sauce was a bit if a let down. When they arrived the wings were sitting on the sauce and not mixed up in it. They were all a good size so not so bad.   My cheese steak was good. It could have used a bit more meat in it but the flavors were well balanced and nothing took away from its taste. I advise to get a side of the au jous and make it an event. Added just the right amount of additional salt and taste.  My friend had the redneck burger no peppers. It was a big hit. The cost of the meal was not expensive at all and the beers are served in old school goblets. Definitely looking to go back and try their famous Stromboli. I'm from the north east so it better wow me!",

Children are allowed after hours but must be accompanied by an adult.  We wanted to try out the chili cheese fries not bad, not bad at all. Well seasoned fries good chili and nice amount of melted cheese. I ordered the small original stromboli since I knew we weren't going to finish the large lol. We both liked it nice crust, inside was nice and hot. They offered more marinara sauce but I didn't think it was needed to we said no. My sister ordered the meatball sandwich and it came with a side, she chose potato salad. The meatballs were very delicious and I actually liked the potato salad it wasn't to overpowering with extra ingredients.   Staff here was very friendly and would definitely return if in the area again.",

After midnight pizzas and Stromboli's half off. Also have specials during football games too during the fall/winter. One of the extremely few places in town where you can get a shiner if you're from Texas and the owner is a cowboys fan from what I've heard in the past. Pizzas and Strombolis are all delicious and you can't beat it when it's $10 at half price. Either that or you go the other end and pay 30-50 at naked city or giordanos. Strombolis made famous by guy fieri/diners drive ins and dives a long time ago. Appetizers are great too. Love the fried pickles. A little smokey inside sometimes though but they have a separate dining area during regular hours. Bar can seat maybe a dozen people with some video poker machines and a few other small tables in the bar area. If you're the snooty type you probably might find issue with this place. Don't expect to get treated like you are at a fancy restaurant. There's the bar tender and the cook. Say hi and don't be a stranger. Blue collars all welcome.",

I ordered the   First I had water the water had a bit of flavor so I didnt drink it .   original strumboli, upon the first bite I notice that the dough was raw still and the center was very cold and the cheese was shredded and unmelted. I asked for the order to be reheated high hopes again I take a bite and the dough was much better but still some undercooked pieces.  Hot wings buffalo very dry was almost offended when they gave me lots of wings with like 1 table spoon of sauce on top of it. Asked for more sauce they gave me more but the wings were overcooked very dry inside .    Basket of Shrimp with cajon fries substitute. Shrimp were average not much flavor really small like popcorn shrimp. I had to ask for coctail sauce . Fries it's personal thing I don't care for steak fries but the cajon friies were decent covered in buffalo sauce I didn't taste the cajon  Mac and cheese wedges were my highlight a bit small but they were ok .   Last I ordered the spumoni it was my first time getting that it was really good I like that but I wouldn't travel to try it again",

So we went and he ordered the stromboli and I ordered a Philly cheese steak. I don't really want to say this because I do not want this place to get crazy busy...but OMG...... that Philly was the most amazing sandwich I have EVER had! For those of you who have followed me or read my reviews...I am SUPER picky when it comes to meat!!! This sandwich not only had the most tender meat, flavored to perfection but the bread was soft but crispy on the outside and the cheese...oh the cheese...melted to creamy perfection over the meat. My husband had a bite and wished he had gotten the sandwich instead...but he loved the stromboli also...just this sandwich...holy moly.. AMAZINGLY Delicious!!! By far the top of my list!!! We even order 2 to go so we could have it the next day too!!! We have been back a few times since and we only order the sandwiches and fries!!! It was as good as the first time!! It is a whole in the wall that is so worth going to!!!  We are about 20 minutes or so away but worth the drive through the spaghetti bowl to get there!!! ;)  I have never taken a picture of it because I can't wait to get it in my mouth!!! Lol!!! Perfection at it's finest!!!",

The location is tucked back in a strip mall of sorts at a busy intersection.  If you didn't know it was here, you may not see it.  When you first walk in, you see a glass-enclosed bar area with video poker and limited seating on one side and a dining area on the other side.  If you follow the little hallway around to the back, you find better diner-style seating.  The staff are friendly and helpful and they always seem to keep up with the tables even when they are busy.  The menu has a variety of Italian items but they are famous for their stromboli.  I've tried many of their items but on my latest visit, my husband and I chose to split two of the mini stromboli's, one original and one ham and cheese.  They were both very good.  They kept us in our drinks and we could not ask for more.",

This place has more regulars than a marijuana dispensary. What brought me there was its reputation for the best Stromboli on this side of United states. 100% True. I ordered the original to go a large. It was huge bread was baked and toasted like a blue collar sandwich Should be. Packed with pastrami salami and running over with cheese. Cut in sections so you can dip it in marinara sauce. It's so big they gave it to me in a pizza box. I sided it with mozzarella sticks and fries. Fries were huge steak fries. People who frequent this place are people who work ordinary jobs just Regular Jane and John doe. They want a place where everything on the menu is not just good but great. No frills cold beer no watered down drinks and Happy hour is 24/7. Part of the bar is sectioned off as a restaurant. With the kind of booths you see in a Copla and Scorsese movie. This is a real bar ladies and gentlemen. Salute!",

This place is definitely a dive, the decor looks like it hasn't changed much since it opened in 77.  But it is a dive, by definition.  It is an odd layout too, bar up front and a few doors leading to what looks like the back dining room.  Note that there is smoking in the bar, this being Vegas and all plus various video type slot games...  Wanted to watch Rutgers dominate Iowa St. in the bowl game Friday so sat at the bar.  Owner Mario was behind the bar and was speaking to everyone (except me, newbie here) by their first name.  Definitely the dive bar now, almost Cheers like. :)  Reviewed Stromboli options with Mario.  Went with the original, small.  More than enough for me since I didn't have a fridge in my hotel room for a Large, double sized, for only $4 more.  Must say that it is nicely crispy on the outside.  Was maybe just a little too much dough thickness than what I like but the crispiness was a big plus.  Downside was that it doesn't normally come with extra dipping sauce, extra charge is what I recall on the menu, should have asked for that anyway even though there was sauce inside already.  It was a good 'boli for sure overall.  Not my personal best 'boli but very good.  And I also liked owner Mario, mostly because how he was genuine and how I saw him treating everyone, including me.  On the way out he asked to check in with him gain next time I am in town.  Looking forward to trying another option and increase my rating...",

We ordered a bunch of items for the group. -Chicken wings were good, nice and crispy with good flavors. -Not a fan of the pizza, reminded of something from pizza hut with too much sauce -THE STROMBOLI- the best i have had since moving west but still not that go to staple i grew up on back east. The outside was nice and crispy but there was alot of dough. I wish there was more meat inside. What was there was good. Not a fan of the sauce on the inside but that's how it was ordered. I will give it another try with sauce on the side. There is a very selective menu with many items that i will go back to try. Prices are very reasonable!",

No, im not saying it tastes like shit.. im saying this is the best pizza i've ever had in Las Vegas, shoot this is the best pizza I think i've ever had in the young 21 years of my life.. and believe me i've had alot of pizza! :)  The pizza had a delicious thick crust. It tasted very buttery & had a hint of garlic in it. Mmm, mmm. The marinara was perfect. I like my pizza's with a litle extra marinara to go along with those awesome toppings and this had the correct combination. We went with the pepperoni pizza since no one could really agree on the toppings. The pepperoni was very good. not tiny slices but medium sized ones. They weren't chintzy with it which i liked. next, the wings were so unique. They we're like chicken patties, which i thought i wasn't going to like.. but actually [to my surprise] i loved them. It really tasted as if i was eating them off the bone. couldn't believe it.   Sadly everyone loved the pizza so we ran out & i still wanted more :/  Will come back for the wings and pizza!",

When I seen the episode, I didn't live in Vegas, but upon moving here, this was one of the first places I had to eat at. Needless to say, I fell in love with it. Every time my husband and I go there, we have to order their Hot Wings.  Their Hot Wings are the \"perfect\" spiciness, in that they have a bite to them but not so much as to numb your lips. Their Pizza is amazing and they usually have some deal going on where it is 1/2 off during Nascar or NFL season. Stromboli there is amazing. Enough said. I also like the fact that you can come and eat there after midnight and get 1/2 off of both Pizza AND Stromboli, which is good if you are a night owl or a clubber.   I live in Henderson, but gladly drive up to the Summerlin area when I'm in the mood for Pizza, Wings, or Stromboli, just for this place. Props to you guys, you're doing it right!",

Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely.   They are known for the Stromboli here. I cant recommend these things enough. They are cooked to perfection and have a great flavor and some amazing crust. I like the Original Boli but my wife loves the Meatball Boli. So we always get two smalls and split them up. Meatball is actually starting to become my fav but again both are really good.   The fried mac and cheese here is another staple that we get. Pair those with a ice cold Killians Irish Red and you got a great meal on your hands. The prices here are really reasonable and the portions are great. There wings are decent but I'm kinda of a wing snob....so I'm tough to please.   If you wanna get away from the madness of the strip and enjoy some great food and some good beers with a nice local feel. Get to Four Kegs. One thing I will warn you about is that if UNLV is playing this place can get packed. Next time I go I think I am gonna try the pizza. Get in here throw some money into a machine order a ice cold beer and relax....CHEERS",

But isn't this how you want to be greeted by a dive bar?    The restaurant is separated from the bar to protect the diners--Did I say diners?  Eaters...--from the smokers in the bar.  It's down and dirty good food at a cheap price and take-home proportions.  And if you're there during an NFL game, pizza, stromboli, wings, etc. are half price thereby making the place twice as good.  My office is just across the freeway and my business power lunches are at places familiar to most, but when I go to lunch with a friend, we go here.  Check your upscale image at the door.",

And when looking it up for the menu on google I came across they were shut down for unsanitary conditions in the kitchen just figured I would put that out there.  I ordered a half rack of ribs 3/10 the price was good but the ribs was nothing special at all. They also can use a better bbq sauce for it. I also had a med pizza with 7 topping add pineapple and that was 4/10 didn't care for it much felt like it was a little soggy as well. Last but not least the famous strombolli which was a 7/10 it's was actually pretty good I wish I got just a few of these and not the rest. So pretty much I recommend if you go to get that for sure. Now back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love. It is pretty dirty and old for sure. The bathrooms were dirty as well with the booth that we were sitting in because the seats were not wiped throughly. Now for the kitchen I couldn't see much but just seeing the back steel panels on the wall you can see layers of build up of dirt. The best part is that it had finger print streaks so it made it more noticeable. Now for the environment it's not my kind of environment especially if I was to come for the tvs because they had these little 20 inch Vizio tvs in the corners that I didn't even realize was there and there was only a few of them. But hey the prices were pretty awesome and the drinks were only $6 each overall I don't think I would come back just because it could use a cleaning and touching up on some food and environment.",

When me and a friend had a hankering for some late night noshing, we went to the Four Kegs specifically for the strombolis.  The original is like a Meat Lovers pizza turned inside out.  My personal favorite is the turkey and swiss stromboli.  Another option includes a beef and cheddar boli.  No veggie option as of yet - sorry vegetarians of the world.    There's also no doubt that the service can some times be lacking, especially around 2 am.  I even wrote a poem about our fascinating blonde hair black roots waitress because her customer service was straight out of a John Waters' movie.  Yes, I have a special place in my heart for the Four Kegs.  It's a greasy, crude, smokey (doesn't matter if they partioned off the dining area from the smokey gaming area at the bar - it's in the walls forever!), loud like your obnoxious drunk friends kind of place.  But the food they serve will satisfy your drunken needs for sure.  The Cajun fries are great, hot chicken fingers and wings fan fare, hamburgers, and ribs.  Definitely not a place for \"dive bar\" seeking hipsters - stay in Silverlake if that's the case!",

I talked some coworkers into going and a group of 8 of us hit it.  When we walked in the restaurant side we were promptly ignored even though the waitresses looked right at us.  We walked around a few minutes looking for an open table large enough and since we were in her way she decided to split us into two smaller tables instead of scooting them together.  The menu selection was good, but our food took forever to get.  The waitress eventually said one of the two cooks didn't show up, so we relaxed and continued watching the Masters.  Once the strombolis started arriving they all looked good.  Unfortunately, 3 were undercooked (raw dough) and 3 were barely warmed through, but at least the dough was cooked.  I think the other 2 guys were too hungry to notice anything wrong.  When we started complaining, there was not much of an apology from either waitress.  One didn't say anything when she took one back to the kitchen and the other just said something to the affect of \"not sure why, they were cooked long enough...\"  Obviously not!  This place is a bit far from where we usually stay when we visit Vegas each year, so when we are back in town again I doubt we will take the time to try it again due to the uncooked food and waitresses that don't care enough to apologize.",

We saw the triple D episode for this place again a few day's before New Year's 2011 and decided to go on New Year's Eve Eve.....big mistake since it was just on TV and it was the night before a holiday. Being that we never been we didn't know how everything worked, like seat yourself. We finally found a table (we were told the place had been busy since 11am and here it was 5:30pm) waited about 20 minute's just for someone to come get our drink order. There was only 2 waitress' working and you could tell they were not used to it being as busy as it was. We finally ordered our food and it took a hour to get our food. Good thing they gave us cracker's to munch on while we waited.  We ordered a large original Stromboli, basket of fries and salad to share between myself, my husband, our 3 year old daughter and my mother in law. It was enough for all of us and had a slice of Stromboli and fries left over to bring home. To be honest it didn't WHOA us and it wasn't horrible but hard to say if we were just so starved from waiting that we didn't care.  Next to us was our waitress' family and they informed us that it's never that crazy and doesn't take so long to get food. We might go back to try them again before we move this summer to another state to really say if the food was good or if we were just so STARVED that anything tasted good.  Being the situation at hand is why I gave 3 stars. If it hadn't just aired right before a holiday and it was this crazy busy and under staffed I would have only given 1 star but since it was this way in hope's I gave them the benefit of the doubt.",

The place was busy and all the food looked good. It's not in the best area of town. I would recommend it because the food is good and reasonably priced.",

This was definitely a dive and I don't care about that but an italian restaurant that uses canned mushrooms???????????  Thank God I didn't get the vegie \"boli\" and my sister in law did because I couldn't have handled any canned vegies.  Our original \"boli\" was okay; it didn't have a lot of meat but a lot of bread.  Not at all like E. Coast \"boli's\".  My niece (2 y.o.) got \"fried\" mac-n-cheese that was just Kraft Mac-N-Cheese fried.  Would I go back??  I don't think so!.  Sorry Guy.",

The beer was extra cold and went down really smooth after the 4 hour flight into the 105 degree afternoon.  The place is truly a dive, but worth the trip off to the north side.  If you're on the south half of the strip it might not be worth the cab fare, but if you have a rental like us it is worth the drive.",

Our favorite things to order are the original Stromboli (pepperoni, ham, sausage and cheese wrapped in the yummiest dough ever) and the Cajun fries.  A large strombolli easily feeds 2 people and only sets you back about 12 bux.  The fries are 3bux and are plenty for 2-4 people depending how much you want to stuff yourself.  Crazy good deal!! Very much a hole in the wall place with great food and people.  We tried the veggie strombolli this last time and it had great flavor.  The restaurant isn't in the greatest area but totally worth the short drive (about 8 miles west of the strip) especially if you go for lunch.",

We showed up not really knowing what to expect and were greeted with a small bar where everybody knew eachother.  there were 3 stools open and we sat down.  Rich the bartender immediately greeted us and asked what we wanted.  we had 3 ice cold(and i mean ice cold!) coors lights within seconds.  we told him we had a reservation at 7 and he asked if i was Bryan.  i said yes and he said he'd just serve us at the bar.  2 hoops games on tv, ice cold coors lights and the recommendations of Rich for food was what was on tap for the next couple hours.  along with our 30 ice cold coors lights we crushed lumpias(a fillipino combo of an eggroll and taquito), wings and of course 2 original and 1 beef n cheddar stromboli and an epic pizza with everything on it.  the food was awesome.  the Stromboli was incredible.  good enough for us to ask if they could make a couple to go.  i took it home the 5 hour drive the next day to LA and rebaked it for my wife and kid and it was just like being back at the 4K.    What an experience!  I will be back everytime i go to vegas.  Rich, Marilynn, Mario....THANKS FOR THE GREAT TIME!    Bryan, John and Rob",

It was this massive looking piece of dough stuffed with pizza toppings. I ordered the Stromboli and when it came out my jaw hit the table! This thing was huge! 4lbs! It had sausage and pepperoni and mozzarella. But what set this Stromboli aside from others that I have tried, was the dough! This Stromboli crust was damn good! It was flaky and buttery and crisp! You bite into it and you have that little crunch from the outside but then the inside is moist and flaky! I'm not even talking about the filling part yet! I'm just so in love with this crust! But with everything together it made for the best Stromboli I ever ate...highly recommend you give it a try",

We both agreed, had to stop and try this place out.  We were very glad we did. I ordered a large original stromboli. It was awesome. I usually eat quite a bit, and I didn't finish it all. The wife got a meatball sub, and loved it. Really liked their fries and ranch as well.  We thought we had a microwave in our hotel, but somehow we didn't. Placed the leftovers in the fridge, and ate them cold the next morning. Both the sub and stromboli were just as good cold.  We liked the place so much, a week later(yesterday), we stopped in on our return trip.   The only way it would've it been better is if I was staying in Vegas, and could've had some drinks with the food. Still amazing considering the situation.

The signs on the door that said \"ring bell after midnight\" or the lack of any windows may steer you away, or sketch you out, but...go inside! The service was excellent and so was the food.

Some friends and I walk in and my first impression is it is a dump.  But I don't judge a book by its cover.  We sat at the bar and ordered a few beers.  Then it went down hill.  It was like pulling teeth to get any service there.  The bartenders acted like it was a problem to get some beers.  After waiting 10 minutes with empty mugs my buddy had to speak up to get another round.  Then the bartender came over and told us \"bartenders do  not like to be yelled at.\"  Sorry dude, but how about doing your job!!  This bartender really had a bad vibe.  Not welcoming at all.    We were talking to the couple next to us, they left with out leaving a tip.  He said the service is terrible, the waitres was rude.  Bad service equals no tip!  I can't blame them either.  In the mean time, we had ordered wings and a stromboli.   We waited for over an hour for the food.  After waiting for the food, and after  the poor service at the bar we just decided to leave.    Why was this place on Diners Drive-in and Dives?  This place is way over hyped.  You can go to any decent pizza joit and get a stromboli.  Its a pizza pocket folks.

The best is the original, but the beef & cheese and the breakfast stromboli were also very tasty.   It's a little out of the way from the strip, but if you have access to a car and are looking for something that isn't a buffet or a very expensive celebrity chef restaurant experience that most meals in Vegas tend to gravitate towards, it might be worth a stop.

The service is nice and the food is great.  i always order fingers plain with about 8,000 sides of hot sauce... they never charge for the extra sauce even though its absolutely ridiculous of me to order it.  During football season they offer half priced wings during games... I love how they cook their wings... they are always crispy and good.  I love that this place isn't a PTs or any other typical/ franchise bar... it is definitely a hidden gem... i always call and order food to go and it's always hot and delicious... after midnight they offer half priced pizza and strombolis... it's been on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and since it has it has gotten a lot of visits... see the pin board to let them know where you're from... but it has never changed...always has my vote for go to bar food and cold beer!",

    "text": "Dive with a capital DIVE (in fact it might be the dive that the dive took).  Don't be rolling over there with your Bling-Bling, Prada Purse or Gucci Sunglasses matter o' fact if you have some yard work, gotta change the transmission on your ride, replace the roof on your crib or clean out your pig pen might wanna do that first, then without showering or changing you should roll over to the 4 kegs for your boli - trust me you'll fit right in, an instant regular. I love Diners, Drive Inns and Dives the show so on Guy's advise I put it on the bucket list.  On my last trip to L.V. I made the venture, SADLY, Guy must inhaled too many bleach fumes the last time he got his wig done up.  I ordered the one of O.G. boli's, one meatball boli, a pizza and some wings.  Certainly smelled good when it arrived at the table and they looked perfectly cooked, nice and golden brown on the outside with cheese oozing out the sides - AWESOME! is what I thought.  I was so disappointed after the frist few bites so I tried the other boli, the pizza and the wings it was confirmed - BUST! (WAH, WAH, WAAAAAAAAAAH).  The Marinara sauce that Guy proclaimed to be \"off the hook\" tasted like it was straight form a can (BTW, the cook looks like he just got out the joint, charged me extra for the marinara sauce - thanks buddy!) The dough which I feel is the most important, was bland and too \"doughy\", meaning it was thick/heavy and fills you up fast.  Pizza I've had better from the freezer section of the supermarket and the wings - NOTHING special. Seriously, I don't mean to be a buzz kill and I for sure don't understand why most of the reviews are beyond 2 stars but I supposed we all have different taste buds.  With that said maybe you should give it a try and judge for yourself, my humble advise plz re-read the first paragraph and roll with a buddy (preferably Vin Diesel).  Paz!",

    "text": "I am no expert in Strombolyism, but I am rather versed in good tasting food, and the Stromboli here is on hit!  I learned about this place from the homie visiting from Hawaii.  I was surprised that he found this little divey spot amongst all the other bujee places LV has to offer (...and I don't ALWAYS mean that in a negative sense, at times I do).  I believe that he discovered it on the show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" hosted by none other than Las Vegas' own, Guy Fieri.   What was shocking was how close this place is to my office too.  I totally overlooked this place thinking that it was just a local watering hole for neighborhood.  Once you enter the establishment, you will notice the bar area.  To the right, you will see the walkway toward the rear where the dining area is.    Be aware that if you are the type that can't eat around cigarette smoke, this may not be the place for you.  There is a non smoking area, but the smells tend to linger through the vents.  Still, once you taste the Stromboli here, it may be more than worth the health hazards.  I have to say that although I am an avid fan of the original Stromboli (large of course), there are tons of other dishes that is offered at 4Kegs, I just haven't tried them first hand but seen some friends order it and vouched its legitimacy.    The large Stromboli could be shared by two unless you are really hungry.  I tend to put in a phone order and just swing by to take it back to the office.  But one thing to note is get extra marinara sauce (a little up-charge is included tho).  Although, the joint is a pretty run down local spot in dire need of a make over, to some, that may just be what many patrons respect, an official 702 mainstay.  Definitely divey but worth it.",

    "text": "This isn't far from my MIL's place so we picked up some food. It's famous, it's close by and I haven't had a stromboli in years.   So inside it is definitely old school. It looks like it hasn't changed in decades, but not in a bad way, more like this place is a no frills institution. The one thing that did change is the barrier of the front bar is smoking and the dining is completely glassed in so no need to avoid it if you're smoke sensitive!   We were a bit confused how this place kinda works for to-go so we get a ticket at the window and pay at the bar, but once we figured that out we got out there fast.   Meatball Stromboli - definitely good, the meatball was tender and definitely homemade. The actual dough had some crunch on the outside, but was chewy inside. I enjoyed it enough.   Turkey, Ham and Swiss Stromboli - this was just okay. The BF didn't like the type of turkey slices they used in this. I felt it needed something, I say go for strombolis with red sauce in it.   We didn't know how filling these will be so we got a large meatball and a small turkey and that was way more than enough. We had left overs.   We also got some chicken tenders and fries. These are typical bar tenders and taste like many bars so definitely premade, but alright anyways. Their medium sauce is more vinegary than spicy.   I'll probably be back for a meat and red sauce based stromboli and probably won't mess with anything else.",

I like that there is a door that separates the smoky bar from the dining room. I have tried a lot of food here, what I like the most is definitely the pizza. The pizza's are sicilian style, with a thick, buttery crust that's cut into 8 squares. One of the pizza's they offer has 7 toppings of your choice, so we usually double up on all the ones we like, and ask for the pizza well done. It comes out excellent every time. Don't forget to ask for a few sides of their delicious homemade ranch for dipping. I also like the cajun fries, which are just fries tossed in hot sauce, but they are pretty tasty. Pro tip: All pizza's are 1/2 price after midnight. If you haven't been here yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.",

    "text": "I have lived in Las Vegas for 15 years and have been to Four Kegs countless times, but this is the first time that I can remember ordering anything other than stromboli.  (Back story: We planned to go to lunch at Triple Play, which had the best club sandwich in town, but when we pulled up, IT WAS CLOSED! Like, fencing around the perimeter closed! I am still reeling over it...)  That said, my heart was set on a club sandwich, so we headed over to Four Kegs, which is not too far away. Pretty crowded for a Friday afternoon, and it seemed like a good mix of locals and tourists, the latter of whom were all dining on the aforementioned stromboli. After ordering our usual beverages (Killian's for him, Shiner Bock for me -- both ice cold on tap), we took a look at the rest of the menu.  My husband had the daily special, fish and chips, which was not much more than three frozen filets dropped in the deep fryer along with a side of fries. Nothing to write home (or here) about.   I, of course, had the club sandwich. Although it's unfair to compare this club with the heavenly (and now defunct) club from Triple Play, this still wasn't quite what I had envisioned. All the usual suspects were there -- ham, turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on rye -- but the bread wasn't toasted, it was cut in half (instead of quartered), and there were only two pieces of bread instead of the traditional (IMHO) three. Don't get me wrong; this was still a tasty sandwich. And I may be knocking it down a grade because I am still in mourning for my Triple Play fave. But while I will now be on the lookout for a place with a great club sandwich, I already know that THIS is the place for a great stromboli. And that's what we'll both be ordering next time. (My tip on that: Order one original and one beef/cheddar, and split them.)",

    "text": "This place was on DDD. After years of saying i need to try this place, I obviously go! Chose it as a little date night for me and my guy.   As we walk in it smells dingy. Smells like an old cigarette butt actually. I don't smoke so that was a big negative to me! So we take a couple seats at the bar. Bartender was a dick. Didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Just slapped some menus in front of us and said Holler when we are ready to order. Um, we didn't say we were gonna eat here and we really wanted a drink. Bartenders there must read minds! So we order our food. Bf had the wings and fries and I had the turkey club. Food was a 7 out of 10 for both of us. I really dislike that they serve food on paper plates. It's just tacky to me. I had to take off the lettuce and tomato because it was very very soggy! Other than that my food was fine. Bf liked his wings. But he said they were really salty. So maybe they can scale back on the salt next time and bf will be happy!   Now the staff... Like I said, bartender was a prick. We had to flag his rude ass down because he did 3 that is THREE trips around the bar and never 1 time asked us if we wanted a drink or even water for gosh sakes! Nope! When we did get drinks there was no syrup in my Sprite. It was all carbonated water. YUK! I took a big drink too :( but after 15 mins I finally got another Sprite! So then my bf puts in a $20 bill into the machine in front of him. The bartender looked at us and said, \"if ur gonna gamble, don't expect me to be at your beck and call when u want to cash out after you win $10 bucks! What is this dudes problem? So my bf had already put the cash in when I reached over and pressed cash out. Screw this jerk. I'm not giving this place my money with him working there. 8 long minutes go by and the bartender is staying on the other side of the bar on purpose. So I waited to the 10 min mark and I got up and told him I want my money, we need to go, and please! He said he will be there in a min. Another 6 mins go by and I got up again. I told him I needed my money so I can leave and get home to my child. So he said \"oh ur one of those huh?\" I'm one of what I asked. \"Oh never mind lady, I'll get ur money!\" Well, not wanting to get the bartenders ass beat and my bf thrown in jail, I didn't tell my bf what the asshole said until we got home. We tried to ask his name a couple times before we left and he kept saying his name was jack then whispers his last name is meoff. So he was saying his name was jack me off. Class act buddy. I know damn well he didn't think of that all alone in his pea size brain!   So the 2nd time I came in I asked to be seated in the dining room far away from that bastard bartender. I ordered my food to go. That was a much better experience because I didn't stay there very long. So word to the wise!!!... Go in, or call in would be way better! Order your food and don't stay there 1 min longer than u have to. Oh, don't u dare gamble either  because they clearly don't want people to. They'll treat you like shit if you do!   1 last thing that is actually positive and I'm so grateful for! The 2nd time we went in, there was this man who was waaaayyyyy too drunk. Bartender should of cut him off 10 drinks ago but didnt. Not surprised! The man was sitting in the bar area when I got there and came to dining room after about 10 mins. He told the waitress that he went to the bathroom and lost his seat and there's no place to sit in the bar anymore so he had to come to the dining area. So he ordered another beer and 2 shots. Waitress came back with 1 beer and a big glass of ice water and a glass of Coca Cola. Told him to finish his LAST beer, drink some water or soda and she is calling a cab right now. He was angry when she said last beer and was even more mad that she wouldn't give him shots of hard alcohol. She told him point blank, \"be as mad as u want pal but you are not killing someone I love because u are not adult enough to know when to quit!\" There were only 7 people in the dining area and we all started clapping and thanking her. She probably saved a lot of lives when she did that. She got a $20 tip from me on a $9 tab. And I know the other patrons did the same. I wish I could remember her name. I'll stop in one day after work and see if I can get it and I'll update my review with her name. Oh, the man finished his beer and 3 glasses of water. Handed over his keys to the waitress and said he would be by tomorrow morning to get his car. Thank god!   I've been living in Las Vegas for 15 years. I've seen the inside of bars/diners probably 1000 times no exaggeration. I've also seen probably 2-4 thousand idiots go stumbling to their cars to drive. And never once have I seen a bartender, waiters or security try to stop them. Never cut them off and don't give a flat f&@k! But she did and for that I am internally grateful! Karma will be good to her!   For whoever has gotten this far on this review, I hope  you found this useful.",

    "text": "I came here for the Sicilian pizza. It's a huge part of the pizza scene in northeast PA, where I moved from. I didn't think I would find it at all out west so when I came across this place on Yelp, I HAD to go and try the pizza.  It's super easy to get to from 95. It's in a plaza and there's plenty of parking. If you happen to go during the day, expect to see nothing for a few seconds when you walk in because it's pretty dark. It's dated and homey looking inside, as is typical of most dive bars. However, for me personally, this felt like the kind of bar that would be attached to someone's house. I dug the inside and the vibe.  I was directed to order from the kitchen counter; a 10 minute wait. Not bad. I've waited longer at some places. Paid at the bar and the bartender asked if I wanted a drink (declined.)  Got home and finally got to taste it. The smell was spot on what I'm accustomed to. The taste is very similar, but it's not exact. I think it's the cheese. I ordered extra cheese so I won't next time. I also think they might use American cheese? (Shame on you, if that's the case.) The cheese takes away from the flavor but overall, I would definitely have it again. And I recommend getting it WITH onions. The sauce, I expected to be too sweet but it was actually pretty spot on.  Everyone else is reviewing the stromboli, which I'm sure is good but more needs to be said about the Sicilian pizza.",

We went late on a Thursday night JUST for food for take out. We entered the separate dining area and then we placed our order. It's really tight like a hall way to get by but it has a handful of booths to sit at.   They have a \"typical pizzeria\" menu. No offense at all, but the typical burgers, pizza, wings, ect. We were after the Stromboli! The menu was placed on the wall but they also have menus. After ordering we were nicely informed that the two Stromboli and wings would take about 20 minutes because of baking. No problem! Oh btw the place is definitely a bit \"dive-like\". It isn't the most modern and definitely not all trendy and stuff.   Also you pay the bar tender just FYI. Kind of weird but makes sense to me.   After that a couple of servers tried to seat us so we just sat down and waited. There's also this really friendly lady kind of roaming to make sure people are being helped and doing okay.   After about 15 minutes the cook walked to our table to let us know the food was ready.  The Stromboli were 12.99, I believe, each. The wings were 8 for $10.00 I believe.   We paid, took it to go, and then we were nicely thanked as we left.  It was a standard and nice interaction done with smiles and that definitely went a long way for me. I appreciated the overall friendliness.   We got back to the house and dug in. I didn't read the whole get marinara thing until after I got home. Fortunately the Stromboli were still amazing without the extra sauce. The dough was what made it for me. Definitely different than a calzone. We got the original which was like typical three meat pizza ingredients and then a beef and cheese one. Both of the choices were spot on. Each is about the size of HALF of a pizza but they are stuffed. They both fit in one pizza box. The wings looked unassuming and standard but were nicely done. They were not breaded and slightly crisp. They were good but nothing to rave about.   I honestly don't have any complaints. The only tiny minor gripe is that the end pieces virtually had no toppings stuffed into it. The dough was so good I didn't mind too much.  I'll definitely be back for some Stromboli.",

Their fried macaroni bites, mozarella sticks, wings and pizza are all incredible; fresh tasting, their own recipes, and unique.   As many have said, the must-have is their Stromboli. Never seen the episode, but apparently it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" and Guy Fieri was very impressed with its quality. I've gotten the \"Original Boli\" many times (marinara sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mozarella) and it really needs to be tried once for anyone visiting Vegas. Ask for extra marinara sauce and dip your way to 'Boli heaven.   It's about 15 mins off the strip, and incredibly unassuming (very, very divey looking inside & out) but trust me; it's worth it.",

'Boli is okay- surprised this made Triple D, but considering it's inside of a bar, quality and flavor are a lot better than expected. Wings were ordered hot but tasted mild, didn't like that the side of ranch was oddly chunky and inside the takeout box, which made it warm and more unappealing.  Service was quick. Order by phone, ready in 15 minutes, take your order receipt to the bar to pay, any tip you leave on card is given to you cash to take directly to kitchen staff when you pick up your meal.  I don't think I've had better food in a dive casino, and appreciate that they're open and take phone-in orders 24/7, but this isn't a place I'm likely to seek out.",

    "text": "OK - I was in Vegas for about a week and I wanted to try all of the triple D locations in town.  I skipped John Mull's because it was 105+F the whole week and they only have outside seating.  I had eaten at a different restaurant every night all week and was getting ready to get on the plane and get out of town.  I had Four Kegs on my list and was determined to get in one last DDD before I left town.  I used GPS to find my way here. It is definitely a dive type bar.  It is on the side of a strip mall.  There are no windows, and there is a sign saying \"over 21 only\" and \"after midnight, ring bell for entry\".  Shady.  Upon entering, you are in a typical looking bar with (because it's in Vegas) some video gaming machines.  It smells of smoke.  Off to the left, there is a glassed off area where you can go through a door and be in a small dining room area (with no smoke).    Since I had to get on a plane in 3 hours, I didn't want to overdo it, so I just got the meatball stromboli as recommended by others on Yelp.  It was very good, but I can see why people complain.  Northeastern folks are used to a certain kind of stromboli (and Italian food in general).  Midwest and west coast people really don't know anything about the East coast pizzerias and subshops so they have no preconceptions going in.    The bolis here have a very buttery crust, almost like a pizza hut pizza.  The fillings are home made and the meatballs are salty but good.  If you are from NY/NJ, please forget about your preconceived notions of what a stromboli should be and just enjoy it for what it is,.  I liked mine a lot and finished the whole thing.  Note that they don't call the sauce \"marinara\", they just call it a red sauce, so just order that if you want to add an additional dimension to the boli.  I ended up not using half of it, but it wasn't bad.  I would come back with friends to hang out here, it's a very laid-back place.  The parking lot was full, if that means anything.",

I'll eat here again...During the day when 3 weird guys aren't standing in front if the door LOL and I'll take it to go.  It really smells bad. I have worked in casinos 15 years it's not this bad.

I read the reviews and decided to try them anyways. We walk in and a guy hands us a menu and tells us to meet him at the register when we are ready to order. We walk thru the door to the dining area and another guy comes behind the counter and asked us if we were ready to order. We finally (because I'm always slow lol) decide on a large sausage and pepperoni and a small meatball boli. The guy hands us a receipt and we go pay. After about a 15-20 minute wait our food is ready. We get back to my house and almost break down the door (it smelled that good!!!!!). The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because there was not enough sauce on the pizza for me and we didn't know you had to pay for marinera sauce for the boli. They were both great (even the next day) but sauce would've put it over the top!!!!!! I wish they would partner with Eat24. I'd order from them as often as I could!!!!",

They have three TVs with sporting events on, we watched the Mets dominate the Dodgers.  I did not even notice the smoke, like some reviewers commented, but I think the new laws (probably three plus years now) prohibit the smoking in a place that serves food.

Awesome selection of beer, great environment... no guys this isn't a spot for date night unless both of you like coming to dives.   The stromboli... I could have eaten another one!

The food though is definitely bar fair, so do not come here expecting a culinary adventure. If you come here starved then the food and portions will definitely satisfy.  I ordered the Boli like I was supposed to, ordered the turkey and cheese one. I was a little disappointed because although the dough was delicious the filling of just cheese and turkey did not satisfy me...maybe some spinach or something?",

Service was AMAZING.. very friendly and very prompt.. can't say enough on that. Also, from watching the other 2 waitresses in action it appears all the waitstaff here is friendly and prompt..  Ok, now on to to the food. We tried the fried mac and cheese, mini corndogs, and of course the original stromboli. Fried mac and cheese... very very good. I've had this dish in chicago many times, but this is the best one I've had. It's fried in egg batter rather than just breaded, and the pieces are small and manageable. Mini corndogs.. well they were just mini corndogs. Stromboli was so good! I'd also like to add that they make these from Scatch so you can add/take out things to your hearts desire.   Lastly... the price... amazingly cold draft Coors light set us back $2 each (on a Saturday nigh no less), and 4 beers + our food came up to only $28 with tax.. not bad at all.   It is just bar food, but it's bar food done right! Great service, prices, and quality will make me a regular here!",

Its a total dive, in the back of a strip-mall casino/bar. Its open 24 hours, seats are uncomfortable, the menus are older than dirt, but the food is really cheap and really good.   We split an original stromboli, a small or medium pepperoni pizza and some buffalo chicken strips. Everything was good, but the stromboli is  excellent, best I ever tasted.",

After multiple times visiting Vegas, I finally tried it. However, my experience would be as a take out order. I must say, the stromboli did not disappoint. I loved how it tasted, nice crisp, crunchy buttery crust and gooey cheese melted with the sauce and meats. Next time I need to experience Four Kegs as a whole, dining, eating and drinking. Till the next time..",

So anything said about this place will be tainted by that fact.  It's a sports bar and it's most definitely a dive bar.  I like sports bars and I like dive bars, so it would stand to reason I would like this place.  Nope, not even remotely.    I will give kudos to the service as the server was really attentive and gave out recommendations.  Though the constant reference to \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" was kind of annoying.  Also, kudos for having the Cowboys' game on the TV (this was preseason football 2011) for me as the lonely Cowboys' fan.    The food... Hmm... Eh... Bleck. I recall having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that was mostly grease and dough.  I then recall getting sick, and I've already elaborated on that.",

And my ex got a salad and... it was really not that good.   Also, the waitress was kind of rude and... slow? I mean, she was nice, but we had to repeat our order like 5 times and go over it with her... and she just seemed to get frustrated and annoyed. All we wanted was half the pizza with one thing and half with another... but yeah. Other than that... awesome food and would definitely go back :)",

My fiance and I walked into the the bar area and we were so confused as to how to get to the dinning area but we found it. We were seated and our waitress was sweet but at the end of our order we wanted separate checks because of our group and she said it was too complicated. Really? So we paid half cash and half card and she just charged everything on one card because she didn't want to deal with it. It was disappointing. I ordered the chili cheese fries and they were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but it was a yummy snack. My friend ordered the bbq chicken and rice. It didn't look like they put effort into making it. I could have cooked a better piece of bbq chicken. My fiance ordered a pastrami sandwich with potato salad and he enjoyed his meal. Would we come back to this spot? Idk I think I would look for another spot on Vegas to try out next.",

First and foremost, patrons are required to walk through the bar which has cigarette smells that have been here for 40 years.  it is disgusting.  I've been there twice and there were several old worn out bar patrons that probably occupy a stool every day.  That is the biggest turnoff for me  Once behind the door to the small restaurant, it's quirky to say the lest.  The service was very good and friendly.  The food was good and arrived quickly. i had a patty melt and it was delicious and juicy and served on marble rye.   I am a loss to figure out whey when there are so may choices in LV for restaurant and folks would choose to go to Four Kegs.  This confirms that there is a lid for every pot an it takes all kinds of places to make the world happy.    I'd never chose to go here, but if a group wanted to go I would hold my nose to get into the restaurant and have some good food.  This is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy.",

The seating was very small. The waitress looked at me and my wife standing there waiting to be sat down. After about 5 minutes she stated \"You know its seat yourself right\" WOW! My wife and I sat down and we ordered. I had the house stromboli and my wife had chicken wings and fries. My wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce. Her order came out great. My stromboli was OK. It was very bland and lacked flavor. I was really dissappointed. The waitress asked me what was wrong and I explained to her the situation. She then left my table and returned with a pizza sauce for the stromboli. She said this was what was missing. I then asked for a re-fill on my water and it came 12 minutes later. The stromboli still was just OK nothing great as I had herd and wanted it to be. The customer service sucked. Thumbs down to Diners Drive Ins and Dives for this recomendation.",

    "text": "30 minutes to take an order at four kegs is unheard of. I grew up in Vegas eating here and in 35 years not once have I ever had to complain about the service or the food. Then on top of it the waitress working on July 6th at 7pm in the back dining area see's fit to take an order from a table that showed up after us. She doesn't refill our drinks and as of now it's been 1 hour. Her attitude is horrible. My medium fingers just finally arrived and they are almost plain with barely any sauce on them. Not even worth sending back. And I'm writing this as it happens. So at about an hour and five minutes, no joke, she shows up with my wife's Stromboli and says that's it right? To which I reply , no, I ordered a philly cheese steak. Wow. The disappointment just keeps rolling in. So now I'm sitting here with no dinner at an hour and ten minutes in. So disappointed four kegs. Thanks to Lauren, never again will I bring my family for dinner.",

Saw the Stromboli on tv and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm Italian and have eaten a few in my day.  Was in Vegas for a conference.  BEST STROMBOLI OF MY LIFE! I got the meatball and hubby got beef& cheddar.  Prefer the meatball but the crust!! OMG!  flaky, buttery even.  Sauce good and meatballs was homemade and fluffy, as if out of my grandmother's kitchen.  Glad we found it.",

The only thing that tasted good was the coleslaw. I drove 1/2 hour from Henderson to try their food since it was featured on TV. Disappointed.",

We split an original Stromboli and fried mac and cheese.  The Stromboli was a bit overwhelming for me but my boyfriend loved it.  The crust on it was out of this world fantastic.  The fried mac and cheese was also super good.  My boyfriend's cousin go the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and that was also huge.  She seemed to like it and the fries were the yummy steak cut ones.    I'll go back if I'm in Vegas again for longer then 2 days and/or if I start going back on a more regular basis.  Definitely a great local dive.",

The table where we sat had tiny puddles on it from the staff not wiping it down properly.   The person taking our order did not seem to thrilled to be serving us.  Then came the food.  I really can't put my finger on what was wrong with it, but the only thing that jumps out at me when I think about it is that I really did not like the cheese inside the stromboli.  The whole experience was unsavory.",

The place is clean enough, but it is old and needs and update. The layout is kinda weird with the glassed-in bar area seperating the dining room. But then again you're not here for the ambience, you're here for the really good and inexpensive pizza pockets!",

I've been there probably 10 times since it appeared on DDD and the original boli is so delicious that I order it every time.  The only other thing I've tried are the cajun fries (fries tossed in buffalo wing sauce).  They were tasty but nothing to write home about.",
