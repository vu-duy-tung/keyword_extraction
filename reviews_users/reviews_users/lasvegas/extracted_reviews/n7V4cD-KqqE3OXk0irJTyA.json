    "text": "So let's start off by saying that this new location at town square in my opinion sucks!  I liked that it was on the strip before because it was more for adults. The reason I gave it two stars because we got a good deal of one large pizza (though the food sucks) and 4 one hour game cards for $40, not bad. Otherwise the place is small , food sucks, and effin kids all over the place who cut you in line because you are an adult and there for don't play games ? (Sarcasm) So its another chuckee cheese but with a different name. If you don't get the $40,deal then its $20,for  100,credits how long is that? Idk it doesn't say .",

I stood by the host table not sure if we ordered there or waited to be seated. All the while,some 16 yr old staring at me not saying one word. Finally I attempt to order and was told I need a table first. Ok cool,but you seen me standing here for 5 min and didn't say a word! Kids eventually had fun on the games you could play (half of them were down). Don't think I'll take the family back anytime soon. Hopefully Dave and Busters is better!",

I also feel that the games take way too many credits to play especially for them to be broken. I always think \"hey lets go to gameworks\" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol",

    "text": "I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be.   But my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for \"adults\" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them.",

    "text": "Bad bad bad bad. I grew up near the Seattle Gameworks. One of my favorite spots. Good food, great venue, great service, great arcade.    The new Townsquare GameWorks is none of those things. This location is an offense to the reputation they've built.  Food: 0/5. It didn't get my sick. That's the absolute best thing I can say about it. The Nachos and Pizza were far, far worse than 7/11. Yes, the pizza you get at 7/11 is leaps and bounds better than what's served at the Town Square GW. The Nachos were better in Middle School. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's edible  Service: despite half the restaurant being empty, the server informed us it would be a 20 minute wait. When I pointed out that fact that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, she told me she was short of servers and just couldn't do it(I've worked in two high end restaurants in my life, and that is pure comedy.) There was one large party, and five other tables. I saw a minimum of five servers. There was enough staff to cover a 50 table restaurant and they made us wait so the servers wouldn't get stuck with more than a couple tables at a time. I talked to the manager who at first seemed to be shocked, then did nothing about it. The server was fairly polite but the host and manager ruined it.  Arcade: Decent. Far below the other GWs I've been to.  There's a reason there was no adult parties here alone. Only kids or parents with their kids. The service is God awful and the food is below gas station fare. The Seattle location is always packed and has more adults than kids. Take a lesson from them.   If you've ever been to a chuckee cheese in the 90s, think of that, with way worse pizza, 5x more expensive food and gaming, and god awful service.",

Unfortunately there was nothing on the menu I could eat so I picked up a salad from a near by place to eat with my family. At first we were told next time we cannot bring in outside food. I apologized and continued to sit while my husband took the kids back to the arcade. There were 2 other families there (one with outside food, a birthday cake) sitting, talking clearly done with their food. The server then came back up to me and my newborn and told me we would have to leave because they needed our table for another group. Mind you, the place was empty with tables everywhere and no one waiting to be seated. She said because I already paid I could no longer sit there. I ordered a coffee so I could sit but was deeply disturbed. I have been a Las Vegas resident my whole life and have never been asked to leave a restaurant after paying for food. NEVER GO THERE! They may ask you to leave after you give them your money for mediocre food.",

    "text": "First off- weird configuration with choppy separation of games and dining.  I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.  After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.    3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.    While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.  We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.  But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square.",

We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card.",

The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.",

The company is always adding new games.  Last time I went there (last week), I found a new Kung Fu Panda game which was ridiculously fun.    There's a pretty good computer/lan center that hosts video game and computer game tournaments.  I'm pretty sure they do Hearthstone tournaments every other Sunday.  The one thing I'm still wondering is when I signed up for \"four free hours\" of computer time during the midnight League of Legends of event, I never received those free hours the next time I came back.    Other than that, there are a good amount of games to win tickets and the prizes are great if you have a kid.  I've already won a giant care bear for my daughter.  Finally, almost forgot, there is bowling.  I believe there were 8 lanes.  The games are not expensive and you can order food there.     Great place for kids and adults.",

More than half of the machines are dead or appear to work and take your credits but end up not working. I paid for their most expensive card ($52) and I can't even use most of the credits because most of the games are dead. It doesn't even appear as though the company cares about the games. They appear to be copying Adventure Dome because now it has one of those immersive rides. I didn't use it but it didn't look eye catching based on the demo they had. If you want to go for an arcade in town, I suggest going to Dave and Busters  at least the games work and the food isn't too bad.",

I've been here before and the service on the restaurant side is less than desirable.  My most recent visit started of course walking to the front to be seated even though the tables are empty.  I was seated at a booth and there were crumbs.  As though the table was wiped down but some debris was left behind.  Adjacent to my booth was another booth with dirty plates/drinks etc. (like everyone placed the dirty dishes at one table to gather together).  Waitress proceeded to \"handle\" the dirty dishes then bring me water.  Didn't see her wash her hands, but she may have.  Food comes (not too long of a wait) and it's missing some stuff.  No biggy, just said hey, missing this and this.  I would of told the guy who delivered the food but he said \"food\" left the tray on the table and quickly left.  Keep in mind I'm still missing stuff from my food, the waitress has been told, then she goes to other tables.  Kind of hard to eat my salad without dressing.  I wait and get it, no big deal.  Food was ok, depending on what you get.  Better off eating elsewhere then going here to play games (assuming you have kids like me)  Happy Yelp community?!?!?! Lol",

They have a defined bar and restaurant area that is pretty much empty every time I've ever passed through and then there is a small gaming floor with a mixture of ticketed gaming machines for kids and other video game machines.   I think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.  There are so many improvements that could be made here to make it better.",

It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!  I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!  The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.  Overall Gameworks at Town Square is a good place to hang out or kill some time, but wouldn't be a place I'd visit frequently.",

    "text": "Yeah...  So Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great.   I agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around.   Staff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.  I walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack.   The bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there.   I know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations.   I can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends?   I wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!",

The only down side is  you don't accrue tickets to get prizes. But this place is a good time for both the young and older crowd and the crowd in between. They have a spot to eat and watch sports on numerous screens, pool table, darts, video games, bowling alley (very small), computer room and a private area for parties. It's a pretty cool setup and would suggest this play for family time or even a date night.",

Compared to the old GameWorks, the selection is a fraction of what used to be and half the games weren't functioning correctly either. Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES. The E-Sports arena was pretty decent and the bowling area looked cool as well.  Be prepared to spend at least $20+ if you wish to have a decent experience as the GameWorks cards no longer work by hours. They work by a points system instead and the games range between 4-11 points. Overall, these guys need improvement if they wish to retain their former glory.",

By problems that meant that half of the games weren't working. I went to the MGM location when it was open and honestly this location doesn't even come close. There are very little games and it doesn't help that most of them were down and the area is really small. Staff is very nice though. Their systems went completely down around 9:30pm and that's when my boyfriend and I decided to leave.   What this Gameworks has that the old one didn't is an Esports area where you can play PC games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I get the concept of this idea, but you can stay home and play these games and this space could've been utilized for more games.   I'll give this place another chance when they've had time to straighten out their kinks.",

My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once.",

    "text": "Albeit a smaller venue, not too bad - kids enjoyed themselves! From my POV:  1. Space too small 2. Too much empty space in the front area so it seems like     they're still decorating or ran out of money 3. When you get a time play card, they fail to     tell you:     a. Can't collect the tickets from games     b. Can't play the \"win a prize\" games     c. Have to wait 1 minute in between swipes before you         can play a new game or add another person's turn -         therefore, your ACTUAL play time drops to 30         minutes  The food looks amazing - but doesn't taste as promising as it looks. Some food items can get pricey.  The eSports room was the area most enjoyed by my family.  Overall, there are other places to spend time with family and friends...I don't know how often we will be back.",

Being new to Vegas, I wasn't familiar with GameWorks prior to my visit there or what to expect from it; I was pleasantly surprised with all they had to offer.   The facility itself is HUGE! There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!!   When you're ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu. My visit happened to be their second day of being open, so their food was still needing some tweaking, however everything I ate did have great flavor. I am definitely looking forward to giving their menu another try.",

The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game.   Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.",

I have heard they are expanding and since I've been back, they had added several more games along with fixing the broken games. Although they may not have had what I expected, I'm still happy with going to Gameworks and playing their games.  The service is pretty good except I did find it annoying when the barista in the bowling area would rather be texting on her phone or flirting with the one guy behind the bar than serving other customers. I had to ask the bowling attendants to get my drink. I understand it's slow, but it would be nice if someone looked up occasionally. But the rest of the staff are very nice and helpful.",

Half the games my kids played or attempted to play did not work but it sure did accept our play points. There were about 4-5 staff members at the front counter but did not see one around the gaming area for assistance. Place was also dirty. Seemed like we were at a over priced chuck e. Cheese's.

She showed me the private party room area, explained the different party packages, food options, and even provided me with swatches for the linen to be sure I picked the exact colors I wanted.  She was super helpful and organized and took the stress out of party planning.   We booked our second party with Johnathan and he was just as amazing.  I have to give a special shout out to, Shannon, the party host we had for our second party. We arrived early before our party start time to set up our cupcakes and birthday banner and she already had all the tables, plates, balloons and chairs set up. The food table was ready to go exactly at Noon like I requested. I never had to ask her to refill any drinks...she made sure the pitchers were always full for our guests. She would always check in with me and my guests to see if everything was okay or ask if we needed anything. I really didn't have to ask her for anything cause she kept on top of everything. She was amazing!!  Thank you Shannon for making party day flawless!  The kids had fun playing the different arcade games. I wish that the prizes were a little better quality but at least the kids had fun...and that's the important thing.   Food was good! We picked pizza, chicken bites, fries, and cookies for our party package. The Chicken bites were everyone's favorite.   Fair price for the party package, good food, good service and he kids enjoyed the games. We will be booking with GameWorks again.",

We were told that there will be more than enough balloons and we could order if we wanted more. We got 4 balloons and the balloon bouquet from the party before us (not even our theme) they told us they ran out of helium then when i complained to the manager, he said my package didnt come with balloons. ( i had confirmed that there will be enough before the party several times and willing to pay extra) On top of that, i have reserve the room for 4pm and they finished cleaning up past 4. I was told i can be there as early as 330 to set up my stuff and there was still a party going on.   The food was definitely not a lot i have reserved for 50 people and i ended up ordering more and spending close to $400 extra because fhe food wasnt enough. They said its unlimited drinks but only had 3 pitchers of soda available and i had to find the person in charge of my party outside the room.   Im giving it a 2 star because the manager atleast compensated and gave us 2 free pizzas and some game card credits. If not for him, i would not even give it 1.",

They want you to go sit down, order a pizza, and then go play games, at which point your pizza will be done and you can eat. We wanted to play first, eat last so we had to go to a hostess who sent us to a waitress, who take 20 minutes to order our pizza and get our game cards. Everyone was getting ancy to play.  When we did start playing, about one third of the games did not work with the type of play card we bought. we couldn't win tickets or prizes with this card.  When we did sit down for pizza, it took 45 minutes for the pizza to show up and they place wasn't even busy. The salads were brown and soggy. The pizza was typical new york style pizza.  So, yeah, not what I would call an awesome place.",

They also have an electronic gaming room for video games, nice pinball section, a nice carnival style type games as well.  The place is clean, including the bathrooms. We were there for about three hours and there was someone going around cleaning up the floors the whole time.  We were on our way to the airport, so Corinne offered to keep our luggage in the bowling alley section where there is a security camera. How great is that? You don't find that kind of service at most family arcades.  We love any arcades, and have been to so many different ones in different cities, and this has to be one of the better ones all around.  On Sundays they have unlimited play for families for 995 per person, which includes a free large pizza. We got the Groupon which was $20 for all day unlimited gaming. Any other video arcade would've set us back at least triple this amount.  Thank you Corinne and staff again for your great customer service and kindness.",

But the service we received was the sole reason to return to GameWorks!  I would recommend that if you go to the restaurant request Fernando you will be pleasantly surprised, I was.",

Bought a Groupon for the last time we came but, wasn't able to get through old credits we had so the Groupon had expired. I was just going to see if I could get face value or something even a $5 game card for the $20 I spent on it. BRANDON, the retail front clerk super patient with me because, reception is horrible over here the Groupon wouldn't work so it took 20 minutes to get it pulled up just to show I did have it. He went above and beyond to work with me even though I wasn't expecting it all. I heard while I was here some of the employees that have been working here a while have said a new large company bought them out and have made so many improvements. I would give 4* due to poor cell service which , is out their control but, Wifi routers were pulled as well and signal from the Wifi is terrible so employees have you get on the Wifi from the restaurant Nextdoor which seriously better. You may want to reconsider getting a good router and solid Wifi points through out building because, Gameworks doesn't work. A server named NIKITA was cleaning a table and my daughter ran and asked him he had any water I told no and he brought out 2 bottle waters even though I didn't want them I was going to pay and he said nope it's on us! I must say employees seemed pleased with changes and as a customer who used to come regular when we had less kids activities will make an effort to make it a regular again especially if you bring back the Groupon deal which has to be a F&B and Bowling money making machine!",

The old Gameworks by the MGM was awesome before it closed. This place is small, and everything's broken. As others have said, the Groupon deal was a disappointment. Every deal I've gotten on Groupon was crap. I've come to realize that if there is a deal on Groupon, don't bother going. The only places offering Groupons, are going out of business. If a deal is available, just keep on scrolling.",

We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too.",

It reminds me more of a \"Dave and Buster's\" establishment with a bar and restaurant available right inside. You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited. But if your just here for fun family and games it'll be experience for you and whomever you want to bring.   Service is really top notch as always. So make sure to enjoy your time here : )  My review is more for the arcade portion of this establishment.  everything else gets a 4 star rating.",

    "text": "This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!  If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.  I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.",

I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.  We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good.   The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.",

Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese.   They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!  Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger.   All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.",

    "text": "A little disappointed with GameWorks. Granted I haven't had any alcohol or food there yet, so they might still be able to earn a star, but..   It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games.   Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet.  Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~!   Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!",

My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!",

We were looking for a place for our team to all get together afterwards so I reserved a party room at Gameworks.   We had never been to a Gameworks before so we didn't know what to expect.  First, working with Jonathan to get everything arranged was wonderful.  He was so helpful and went out of his way to help me with food options for the kids that have food allergies.  Once there, we had 2 people helping us with all the food and drinks (Adrian & Jordyn, I think) and they were awesome as well.  Everyone had a great time.  Next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely arrange another party there.",

I have two social groups and wanted a safe, fun and relevantly inexpensive yet private room for an event I scheduled. Did you know GameWorks Las Vegas has a fabulous indoor bowling alley? What? And it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. Yes!!   I work with this AMAZING event coordinator named Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn is simply AMAZING! I absolutely love working with her and she is beyond professional. She is one of the best employees period that I have ever come across and I have worked with a lot of people. You definitely get the most bang for your buck and work with a consummate professional If you book with her.  I had a phenomenal Halloween Party the Monday before Halloween and my guests and I had a ball! GameWorks has \"food\" and drink Happy Hour specials, pool and great bowling sections. They even have this feature that allows your little ones to bowl and they provide them with a 6 pound ball. Wow!  If you want to host a great company party, family fun day or just hang out and bowl in a private bowling area (inside) book with GameWorks Las Vegas.",

It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one.",

Played almost every game in the place with there unlimited hour game card.  Really fun games.  Lots of choices.  Dark escape 4D is by far the tightest game there.   I could play that for hours.   The food I thought was average bar food.  Had the buffalo wings.  Nice size wings, perfectly cooked crispy yet juicy inside.  Could of been a little spicier and saucier.  But still really good. Would order again.   Wasn't sure how it would be with all the negative reviews.  But I'll be back for sure.  Cool place to catch a NBA game.  Have a few drinks,  do a little gaming.",

The only draw back is there should be an eating area where the kids can eat and talk with each other than only at the play stations. I would highly recommend this venue! We did add an additional hour of gaming time as well.",

She was used to the E-sports center but was at the register today, and let me tell you, it was stressful but she handled it with ease. She kept conversation and was mindful of my birthday and Groupon promotions and honored both. She was just a great conversationalist and honestly should be in management for how she handles situations. Definitely would want her on board with my business, that's for sure. Also, Manager Troy was more than accommodating with everything throughout the evening. He made sure my girls left with an even amount of prizes. Bless his heart, because that would not be a fun car ride home.   There were a few games out of order, and I mentioned it to the front and they sent attendants out to fix the issue in no time. Excellent customer service.   Tyler, at the bar, thank you for your understanding and outstanding customer service. My friend had ordered a whiskey smash, but it tasted more like a strawberry lemonade on the dollar menu at Del Taco. We mentioned it to Tyler and he apologized for the other bartenders error and remade a Jack N Coke, since that is what usually gets the job done. Tyler was very helpful and made adult time, much more enjoyable and worth it.   Can't wait to come back, KID FREE!!",

Although there's just a few lanes, you can't go wrong with the prices especially since it's basically like Cosmic Bowling for only 2.50 per child and 3.00 per adult. There's also an (alcohol) bar inside and pool tables for 5.00 an hour. Major plus is that it's much cooler inside the bowling center than it is on the game floor.",

My complaint is that several machines were broken and not marked.  Tickets weren't always dispensed to the card and machines froze on us twice.    Lack of staff on the floor (we got there at 11am) and the games that were available were dirty.  We purchased unlimited cards and often had to wait the time limit before swiping the card at different machines (each of my kids had their own card).  That was pretty annoying.",

We even popped in unexpectedly one day to see the space and she made time to show us and answer any questions we had! From start to finish, she was readily available and easy to contact for anything we needed.   The day of the actual party, the service staff was SO friendly and helpful. The attention they put into our party really meant a lot! Even the manager, Corrine, went above and beyond to make the day extra special!

It would have been longer but they went on the Dark RideXD 3 times which was $5 per ride but they enjoyed this the most. They did Gigamon, the Pirate one and the Werewolf one. The gal was nice enough to throw in a free ride since it was a slow day. It was neat because there was a monitor so I could watch what they were doing inside (it's like a little theater). She also let me watch some of the game on her monitor so I could see what they see (minus the 3D). I thought the Werewolf one was really cool.   Location: Inside Town Center, lots of parking.

Hawaiian Airlines recently had our holiday party held there on Jan 21st and it was the best party EVER!!! Ron made sure the party went on with no worries and no problems. Lets not forget their delicious food we ate Pizzas cheese and Meathead pizza's, kids favorite sliders, calamari, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and their chicken cobb salad and caesar salad was a hit with everyone. Our families enjoyed themselves and we definitely recommend any company or families who are looking for a place to hold their events at. This is the guy to see Mgr Ron Arenas at Gameworks at the Town Centre Mall",

After hours of shopping with the kiddos, they deserve to have their fun.   Other than that.... This new game works is super boring, not enough games, my kids were bored 20 mins into playing.   FOOD is crap. They don't even have the option of getting a whole pizza like the old Game Works at MGM. Only a pan size personal pizza for $14. Nachos with \"string\" like shredded chicken which had no taste and hardly anything on them.   SERVICE. Well, wasn't too great. Had to call her to order and since it was our first time at this location, we had a lot of questions about the menu, and she was a little irritated with our questions. We then finally ordered. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and chicken nachos.   She told us if we added $3 more dollars to each of our items, we would get a free play card. So it would've been perfect for not buying more play cards. So we did add the $3 special for the card play, but she didn't mention to us until after we won at least 10,000 points on games that it wouldn't be included on their dinner play cards.   Not only did the server and this place ruin our dinner, but made my kiddos cry for not getting any prizes they've earned on those games.   NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE BACK.",

The girl talking care of the party was slow, and uninterested, not very engaging with the kids, just talked to employees and texted on her cell phone. Sharice .  That's the only disappointment since coming here.   We had a great bartender at the party in the bowling room.   I've seen the same bartender there everytime I go.  He's African American with a goatie, sit in his section and order a Moscow Mule!  I'm a connoisseur of Moscow Mules (lol) and he makes them better than Mandarin Oriental, Wynn, all the top places in Vegas who have them on their specialty menu.  The perfect amount of alcohol to spice, taste incredible!  Great place to let your kids run amuck while you drink at the bar and order food.  I definitely recommend this place for birthday parties, regardless of the girl who hosted my sons party.  Looking forward for my sons 9th",

We arrived to game works early to set up and everything was already set up and ready for us. Our party host Brittney was attentive to my guest, because a bunch of boys will undoubtedly spill a drink or two, and the food and drinks never ran dry. One of the biggest compliments from our parents was in regards to the food, they were all impressed on how good the food tasted, the Italian spread was delicious. I will definitely be back.

They serve drinks from the bar inside the gaming lounge which is really convenient. They also have a decent happy hour after 9pm. I usually go with my girlfriend at least once a week we really enjoy it!  Haven't used the other part of gameworks at all. Seems like its way to bunched together they need to open up the dining area to more games I never see anyone using the dining room anyways. Just my thoughts!",

    "text": "Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down.   First of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.  Second, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said \"They never work\".  This brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.  Lastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.  I wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I'm sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame.",

Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.",

Be sure to reload your card and if a machine doesn't work but you paid, they are more than happy to help you get a credit. We went with some friends, got a bucket of beer and chilled in the video game lounge to play some FIFA and had a blast. They aren't open super late but the hours are still great.  If it's a really large group of people coming out, definitely ask them about their group packages for food, drinks, and game play.  If you play the dancing games like DDR and whatnot, please share or take turns. Sometimes there are some people who don't leave there and the rest of us can't have one play.  I think that's more of a courtesy than it being Gameworks fault or anything. The drinks at the bar are really good and every time we have been there, the bartender was amazing and checked up on us promptly. Give it a try!!",

Sadly, the location in Vegas is the worst we've ever been to. We tried on two separate special night occasions, a year apart from each other and they were both terrible experiences, the 2nd one, even worse so there have been no improvements. You may not believe this but probably more than half of the games there were broken or not functioning properly. Why is this? No excuses! I don't understand how they stay in business, to be honest. So very disappointed. This place could be amazing and it should be, it's in Las Vegas. It should be above and beyond! We travel a lot and visit other similar type places often and always have a great time. I would give this place one star based on what I've written but I gave it two only because we complained each time and were instantly refunded our money. We will never go back. We've learned our lesson and have moved onto other arcades in Vegas such as in NYNY and Excalibur. SHAME ON YOU GAMEWORKS! Take care of business and bring back business!",

    "text": "I remember having so much fun when Gameworks was on The Strip back in the 90's but they closed their doors for reasons I can't remember. But they oepened at Town Square a few decades later...now, I feel ancient.  The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.  I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.  I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.  I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.  But what I'd like to know is: what is that green phallic thing they have for prizes?",

You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food.  The \"prizes\" are ok.

The bartender was horrible and very slow, he never offered us a refill of drinks and ignored my husbands several attempts to get us another round.  Employees of Gameworks working tables seemed irritated with the bartender as well. I told my husband forget it finally. The game prize host was the sweetest, i didn't get his name. Games were working well. They have pool tables and a bowling alley. It was nice that they offered free family games to check out and play at tables like Trouble, Monopoly, Cooties, etc. The restroom was clean.",

The esports Center was closed and the few arcade games that were not broken had lines with people who just were not getting off the machines. Thankfully I only paid 24 bucks for both my sons but even that seems steep with what was offered. Lame experience overall and wouldn't recommend",

    "text": "GameWorks is one of my favorite places to go if I want a fun, casual evening with friends. I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.  The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.  Drink a beer. Kill some zombies. Race a motorcycle.",

The wings were great except that it took them over 30 minutes to bring the sauce for the wings. Then another 15 minutes to bring utensils. There isn't a host for your party so pretty much I initiated everything. I was rushed out the room and told that there was another party right after me which wasn't True. The 1 hr game card only works for arcade like games which was so-so. I gave it two stars because my son liked the arcade section. I wouldn't do another party here.",

There was but 2 other tables in the whole restaurant so not a busy night. The place was clean but the food was not on point, you need a few beers in to think it is delicious. I got the burnt end brisket burger, the burnt end brisket is cut into squares and hardly burnt almost like if it is pre cooked. It tasted like the ready to eat bacon at the grocery store with soggy fries. The game area: out of 75% of the games I swiped my card the arcade games didn't work or were malfunctioning and others had literally broken pieces. To me seems like they have little maintenance. Some would take my credits and nothing would happen, and of course no one on the floor to assist. Oh yeah you have to pay $2 for the card. I wonder if I can get a refund of $2 since I'm not planning on going back anytime soon.",

My friend went behind one of the service stations and got us plates & silverware after our pizza had already gotten cold.  Pizza was so-so , definitely undercooked and super greasy. Waited thirty minutes for a refill on drinks until we finally pulled a different server to refill them for us.  Waited another 15-20 minutes for the check. After that was done, we waited for the game card while watching the waitress go to every single one of her other tables to chat and talk with her friends before we got our game card. . .

    "text": "The new town square location is convenient. I came for Sunday football and met up with some friends, some of whom have children.  Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing.   The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.  There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.  As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.  I cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed.",

She is a credit to this establishment and a great person to have on the front lines.

I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.  The beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.  The game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!    After speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.    Be patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available.   Oh yeah, there is bowling and computer games there too (not sure what those are all about).",

    "text": "Just started going to GameWorks in the last 2 months. This was my 4th time at this GameWorks in Town Square. This time I never even made it in the shopping part.  We had so much fun! I have never spent 6 hours in an \"arcade\" so to speak. We played 4 games of bowling, then got obsessed about the \"Milk Jug\" toss game. Played tons of carnival like games, which was nice. Video games aren't my favorite so having these carnival type games which really prove skill were great!  However, the best part?? Well, if you bowl go and see Alicia (pronounced Ah-lee-see-ya) she's a doll! Very sweet and attentive.  Then there's Bryan (bartender) we like to call him Bryan with a \"Y\". Who doesn't love their bartender? Bryan was funny and remembered my name (so important). We were certainly entertained by him.  They even had a Tech person on the floor fixing games if needed. Marc is his name, I know this because I lost a ball behind some games and wanted to point it out to him. Marc was then fixing something in the bowling alley and came by to say hello.  Really kind, fun loving staff!  At the end of the night, I did my due diligence and spoke with Cody the manager.  Thanks Cody, these young fun staffers are awesome! You did a great job, please let them know because of them we will return again!",

I have to say this place gives my child hours of fun with the variety of things they offer. I also want to take the time to point out that their management address here customer concerns. This weekend my son and I went there for games & dinner and had a hard time getting seated for unknown reason. I spoke with the manager Kaitlyn about the issue and she was so nice and helpful. She wasn't just helpful she actually heard me and made the visit that much more pleasant for all of us. Can't wait to bring my son back next weekend. Thanks",

After a while it can get a bit repetitive. Sometimes their games are out of order; and when I came back a week after to see if it got fixed, some machines haven't been fixed. I like their new addition, XD Ride. It reminds me of a ride at Circus Circus and it's always fun to go against a big group of people to get the highest rank. They have a wide range of prizes to choose from. From my experience, it's been easy to rack up your tickets, so you can leave with some hefty prizes! I love the idea of storing your tickets in a card because that decreases the waste for paper!  Their restaurant food is good! Some of their new items actually have surprised me in quality. I'll always be a sucker for their french fries. Their presentation of food has gotten way better in the years. Now their nachos come out of a big tin can and the server will take the can away and let the nachos fall!  Now, my absolute favorite part of Gameworks is their staff. Their staff is so friendly and amazing. Especially in the card host stand and in the Esports area. I can talk to those employees all day! The employees in the Esports area really know their stuff about games, retro to current! They're super helpful and laid back.",

I saw on at least 3 different occasions where a 2 person shooter game only had 1 gun..  We sat down on another 2 person game, and the start button only worked for one player. The calibrations were off on a couple games (shooting far left, and the crosshairs are all the way over to the right).  The basketball games with their sad, deflated basketballs, with pieces of the ball literally falling off. The one football game that did work, again had sad deflated footballs. However, I did see Tom Brady playing the game, and those deflated footballs really sent him over the top for the high score. This place is literally the biggest joke, and saddest excuse for an arcade that I've ever seen. This is Las Vegas... get your stuff together!    Ps...  GameWorks management, don't bother responding to apologize, and urge me to check out your rewards program. We will never set foot in here again. And for the sake of everyone's sanity..  Take your business off of Groupon. You're not set up to be anything more than an old, tired, rundown graveyard for games. Time to close the doors, and replace it with a Dave and Busters.",

While we dined the staff was so accommodating and allowed me to bring my sons birthday decorations , balloons and gifts since it was going to be a small group gathering.  Justin was our server and he was so attentive! He checked on us often and made recommendations for food options . I truly wish the world had more people like Justin because he made our dining experience exceptional. After dinner and cake we went to the game area and needless to say my kids had a blast. The new Zombie attraction is truly worth every token! It's a 3D experience that will have you screaming as the zombies jump at you! The roller coaster simulator is also one to try , it makes you feel like you're riding on the real thing. Out of all the options of places to visit with kids that we have in Las Vegas GameWorks takes the trophy!!!",

    "text": "This place has potential to be a great location for family fun, however, the lack of service (extremely slow) and the quality of food is much to be desired. I had a party of 5 and we got seated quickly but it took no kidding 10-15 min for a server to come to our table.  After a bit you just stop asking for things because it takes so long. The layout of where the dining in relation to the kitchen or service booth is too spread out. This place has the starting of a good thing but I probably won't come back. The first time I gave them the benefit of doubt but the second trip pretty much made the decision for me that this is how gameworks operates. So, in my opinion just come here for the games don't come here for the food. It's just not worth it.",

Rami took especially good care of us (one of my youngest was scared on the 3D ride and she stopped it, took him off and then restarted it for my other kids so they didn't miss a thing). And when a game didn't work, they took care of it right away. Even the toys you buy with tickets are better quality then most in places like this.",

Drinks and food took forever and then it took over a half hour to get the bill in a fairly empty place. In fact I'm still waiting for the bill so I can sign it from miss happy server. Crappy night!",

I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!",

Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.  Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything.   I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!",

The Pac Man air hockey game was a big hit! Although they don't have a DJ and dance floor like they do at Insert Coins, this was still a good time.  I also liked that they had a full bar with drinks that weren't overpriced. The bowling alley also looked very intriguing, but alas, we didn't have an opportunity to bowl on this occasion.

Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good!  Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were \"out of service\". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!",

We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer. On the next visit my husband and i will get some food and drinks while the kids go play.",

Jarred was very knowledgeable about the food menu and was spot on about the Short Ribs entree (2 big pieces of beef short ribs over a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy). Wish they had more games tho. I spent about 2 hours on the new Transformers game and the jet fighter game.",

    "text": "Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.  Now let me begin...  First off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could've ever imagined. There couldn't possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there's not much else to choose from....remember there's not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I'm not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don't understand why they wouldn't be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F.   The e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it's there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I'm not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.  The bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don't have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They're basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven't played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.  Lastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant yet...and i don't believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be \"a while\" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...\"a while\" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I've never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you'd think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn't far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: \"we don't allow outside food. Sorry.\" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I'm sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D.   Worst gameworks experience I've ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I'm 26 now. I've never seen anything like this. It's as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!    i give them six months to add more games before i write them off my hangout spots list.",

I'm glad that Las Vegas is putting money back into places for kids and teens to enjoy and not just for adults.   It's at a really easy location to get to and away from the busy hassle of the strip.  The old Gameworks on the strip was a great place but let's get real it was dying and had to be updated. I understand people's complaints about waiting and the lack of games but it's 2014 and we have to be realistic.   And if your gonna be one of those people to complain about oh the lack of games cry about it.. I bet you only went to the old game works once or twice a year. If your going to be stuck up about it go try and find some where else with all the awesomeness build in one place.. And when you do please let me know..   But till then Long Live Gameworks!  - Bart Sampson",

The place wasn't even as crowded as you would expect, I think because the word is out on the place already, and i got there at 8:50pm to eat, way past the dinner rush and the popular 6-7:30 dinner rush. One and a half hour meal and drinks could have been finished in about half that time, just spent too much time waiting. Me and Gary Z preordered our next drink because the first drink took half an hour to get the first one, lol. At least 35 min to even take our order for food.

It took 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. After that, another 5 minutes to take our drink orders. After we ordered, we watch the bartender as he scrambled to figure out where everything was. Our drinks were simple, not fancy at all, one vodka soda and a whiskey coke. After looking for a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that they're out of the vodka I wanted, so I quickly picked another. He took about 4 minutes to make each drink. After sitting for 30 minutes at a half empty bar, we finally got our drinks. If this is the way the service will go, we will not be returning and I'm sure it will not create any repeat customers.",

A large percentage of their games were broken so my friend and I could hardly play anything together. They had a cool picture booth but that was about it.   Even on the game we managed to play together 15 minutes before it closed we had 2 different employees tell us it was closing with an attitude.

Amazing atmosphere all around and surprisingly enough, not as loud as I expected to be (but then again it was a semi late Sunday night.) The food provided was excellent--we had a range from Pizza, wings, mini pretzels, tortilla chips, jalepeno poppers and mini sliders (which I kept coming back for, haha.) Our hosts were amazing! I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back? Probably not because it is QUITE a distance from my place of residence but for special occasions, absolutely. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing an arcade fix or just a cool place to hang.",

I don't see them having enough business to pay for the strip's rent, so I understand.  Moving to the Town Square is a great move.  Pros:   - Love that they were open until midnight. Went to a movie at 10:45 and wanted to kill time before. -It was pretty fun  -The prizes really are better than most places (keep in mind, most prizes are for kids, and kids love these weird prizes) -Bowling looked pretty cool, didn't see prices though  New ticket system could be seen as pro or con. All tickets go back on the card  Cons:  -NOTHING FREAKING WORKS. I mean seriously. You just opened. There is about 7 basketball games, only two worked. -Operator didn't work (wish I could play that) -2 wheel spinning games didn't work -Spaceballs worked and then would flash out of order, then work again. -Tetris style game didn't work -A couple of games ate our game card points and didn't work -A few more games didn't work.  A total of about 1/3 of the games didn't work which is pretty lame since it is really busy in there.  -It definitely should be bigger with more games. -The gameperks doesn't work here because \"their system isn't synced\" -They are very very slow. Workers took a long time to load points on the cards, one time was out of printer paper and wouldn't let people buy cards for about 20 minutes. -VIP members have different credit pricing but we can't get the VIP member pricing?  We spent quite a bit of money here for a birthday. About $130 and got about 8,000 tickets (which are all kept on the card) Used 3200 for a giant lego pillow (cooler prizes than most places) Don't know if we will be back",

There was not enough newer games out on the floor and I can see that they are trying to copy Dave & Busters theme.

    "text": "SCAM ALERT!  I should probably give this place more than 1 star b/c there are things that I like.  But I have a difficult time when places are blatantly being cheap and cheating children and families.    Specifically, I'm referring to their Wizard of Oz machine which is one of those coin dozer type games where you knock coins down.  This game was fun to us at first b/c it has cards that you can collect and if you manage to gather them all, you can turn them in for a ticket bonus of like 2000 tickets.  So I learn that the Toto dog card is the rarest of the bunch and there are only a few in each machine.  And obviously you need this card to complete the set and the ticket bonus.  Well obviously they are aware of this too b/c they literally have all of the Toto cards out of play.  How do I know this?  Because they are stupid enough to put them in the machines at the very top of the decks so that you can see that they are in there.  But the cards fall from the bottom and somehow the Toto card is always on top.  Not 1. Not 2. But 3 in plain view and out of play.  I have been in and out of there for over 6 months and just check as I walk by and they are still right there on top.    I would never accuse a place of being shady or trying to scam people without being sure... but I think 6 months straight is a fair amount of time to base my accusations.  I have pictures as proof on my other phone.  Who knows what other games they have rigged that aren't so obvious.  It's sad really that a business would be so cheap when it comes to winning a relatively small amount of tickets used to buy mostly junk toys.  Shame on Gameworks for taking a game that is expensive to play anyways and feeling the need to cheat children and families.    I'm taking my business to other places.  John's Incredible Pizza is a very good alternative for those that don't like to support shady businesses.",

Most games cost more then a dollar a piece! The place is set up horrible! Destiny is it will fail! Your no longer on the strip your in a local mall!  20 bucks 100 points a game takes 9 points 11 games 20 bucks! And we're talking a stupid ticket game that's over in 20 seconds! Same crap at chuck e cheese 20 cents....... No kidding!",

After purchasing put game card we discovered 50% or more of the games were broken and most of the others we tried to play either were malfunctioning or would freeze while we were playing. Along with that there was no one to greet us as we walked in. Apparently they were not serving food that day either which we learned by a taped piece of paper on the wall.  The carpets are filthy and the smell inside is quite unpleasant.  We came here when they first opened and it was great, but has gone down hill fast.",

    "text": "Very very meh. My son wanted to leave before I asked him too. At least 7 games didn't work, weren't turned on or had bad joysticks or bad calibration. The ticket basketball game started but didn't have any basketballs!!!   The selection of games is very poor. They had several riding/driving games. And they were the standard run of the mill fast and the furious type. There was one that the steering wheel was stuck and we couldn't play it because we couldn't steer. Wasted money on that one. The other ones we played the steering was too loose and you ended up all over the place but not on the course.   The only race game worth it was Mario Kart.   There was three fighting games. Tekken was good as always. Marvel vs Capcom machine was shot. The screen was messed up and couldn't be played. Didn't even get to play. Street Fighters joysticks were busted and couldn't be used to do anything but random forward and back.   Pinball machines were meh. Ghostbusters was the highlight here. The Game of Thrones one was missing it's glass panel where the artwork goes.   The hunting shooting games didn't seem calibrated. Also we inserted our cards in the cabella big game hunt game and the system rebooted and we lost our credits. Just walked away from that one.   The Star Wars flight simulator thing was pretty bad ass. Me and my some both like it. He was shocked that when you take off a little puff and wind hits ur face.",

I love playing video games and love to drink, I'm in heaven because this place has both. I can't say anything about the food because I've never had it. I can say that the service is either hit or miss, most of the bartenders are really really nice I've had 1 bartender a really pretty asian girl with a bad attitude but other than that I can't complain. I typically have a beer on draft and they are always very cold and the prices aren't bad. I always go for the Groupon special $20 for the all day pass because I could spend Hours playing games. Keep in mind that Game Works is not a big place so Yes you will have to wait for a game or two. This is a great place to come during the week and kill some time while having a few cold ones.",

A few games were broken, but there were so many others to choose from.  We stayed there 5 hours and boys still weren't ready to leave because they still had 5 more hours of game play left!

The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.  I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.",

And I gave you $25?\"   In which her response automatically was \"Oh so you weren't giving me a $5 tip?\" Which turned me off because in all honesty I didn't like her tone or the way she was looking at me. Like I was ignorant or something.  I said \"Actually it would have been a $7 tip\"  Which wasn't a problem, I'm literally keeping track of how much cash I spend. But when you get nasty attitudes then I no longer care about how you feel or what you say.   And before I could finish what I'm trying to say she starts going on a rant about how usually people just give her $7 if the bill is $18 and if the bill was $15 people hand her $22.. okay that's cool and all however that's not what I asked you nor did I say anything about the amount of your tip I was asking how much cash I gave you.   Then she continues on about bartending and tips I had to interrupt her because I've bartended too, I'm also a hairstylist and never do I ASSUME people are going to tip certain amounts because sometimes they don't and I don't get upset when people ask me how much cash they gave me. I just give them the answer.   Some of the machines are broken my fiance swiped his card and lost points for it.   Anyway the manager is nice however we probably won't come back here. Which sucks for me cause I like gameworks back where I'm from and wanted to come back and bring people.  Julius was so nice though!!!",

The bartender also had a bad attitude, I questioned a double crown neat because it looked like an ounce and a half.. which is the standard for a shot. She grabbed the glass and went over to her jigger and measured it out but spilled some on the process. The second shot wasn't full but she shot me a look like \"See?!\" so I wasn't gunna piss her off more by telling her I saw it wasn't full I saw her spill some in the process. I did ask if the jigger was only an ounce and she said yes. Super low house pour.. and the fact that the second wasn't full basically meant I paid $15 for a standard shot.  The other drink I ordered was flat.. I was flustered by her attitude and didn't ask her to remake it.   Not a good experience with the employees but we had fun playing games.",

My son played the fish game like 10 times alone and hit the 500 grand prize and 150 twice the girl said oh the machine isn't working then maybe put an out of order sheet on it.

    "text": "So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done.   I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good.   If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.",

My friend and I both agreed it was the most fun night out we've had out together, and that this is going to be our new \"spot\". We had a great time exploring the variety of games and ended up bowling 4 games because every time we went to the counter, Alicia was kind, funny, and engaging. I bowled my best night EVER - I'm convinced she's lucky :)  We ate dinner elsewhere but the drinks were great and the staff were superb! We had one game break down on us and within 5 minutes a technician was working on it. Marc also came by to check on us later and make sure everything was great, which it was!  Bryan at the bar made us laugh over and over and remembered both of our names. He makes great drinks and fantastic conversation! Exactly what you need in a bartender...  Long story short, this place was great! We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back!!!",

I'll be back. 5 Stars... LOCATION: This Gameworks is located in a Mall that I had no idea that it even existed.  \"TOWN SQUARE\" is really kool, lots of posh clothing stores & eateries.  5 Stars.

    "text": "Update: Cody the manager is amazing! Made all wrongs right! Saved a 2 star to a 5. Great job   We started with bowling. The atmosphere is great. The lanes, not so much. Fun but not good for real bowling, the floors before the lane were greased too so I almost hurt myself slipping and my son stretched his groin. Our server in the alley though was really great with the kids drinks and such. Then we went to get a table, the eating area has an entrance off the games floor but no host or sign to indicate to see a host..  was confusing.  We finally figured out where to find a host to be seated and we stood there for 16 minutes waiting to be seated while one of the servers checked the floor plan and said he couldn't help us. Once we were seated Erica was our server. She was prompt in greeting the table and she was friendly but that is as far as my praise will go for her. Our food came out in an appropriate amount of time and the food runners explained what they were dropping off. The food was amazing, which is the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1. We had to ask for refills every single time.... we are a party of 5 but only recieved plates and roll ups for 4. No boxes offered.  Basically have been ignored until my beer was empty for 10 minutes. No one once asked to assist me with siging up for the rewards program, even though I have the filled out slip sitting in plain sight the whole time. I would have asked about it but the server asks a question, gets the answer and immediately turns away. Also the rum & coke my husband ordered was not made correctly, this is feedback from a bartender for 22 years. Keep up the good work kitchen, you're killing it! Service & management, figure that stuff out, you are sorely lacking.",

Went to eat in the restaurant and everything was slow. Like... Realllllly slow. From the kid who is the \"host\" moving at a snails pace amd chit chatting in the restaurant area while people are waiting.. To the 20 min it took for someone to even acknowledge our presence... I FINISHED my cocktail before a coke and water made it to the table. The bartender is apparently the only one functioning. Food is really just mediocre for how insanely long everything took.   THEN.... We played games... Good times. Sucks that some of them go out of order right when you swipe your card for credits but I mean that's going to happen.   My suggestion? Grab a lil Caesars pizza to eat at home before heading over to play games!!  $90 for a subpar meal and some of the most lacking service I've ever had.",

    "text": "This place gained an extra star. I visited again this summer with my kids and the POGO pass (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpogopass.com&s=b49e7dcfedce5d07a286876bf69576f80a3dd0cf8fcff8002c83c89dcadf881d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pogopass.com</a>).   The main reason my review gets an upgrade is that they changed the layout! The layout was very cramped on my first few visits, but they changed it up. It is still crowded, but I found it to be much easier to walk around and not lose my kids. Thank you from a single mom because that can be a headache.   The POGO pass gives you 1 hour unlimited play. The unlimited card does not allow you to get tickets for items so if you like to collect as many tickets as possible this is not the option for you. Unlimited play is similar to the all day pass they used to offer on Groupon. You can only swipe once a minute, so if you have multiple kids then it's best they have their own cards. Some games are so fast that you want to swipe again within the first minute, but my kids got into the habit of counting down. It is a little frustrating and takes patience from the kids when the card says \"Sorry please Wait\" I still think it is a good deal overall because if you had purchased tokens for the same amount of time then the kids would be swiping like crazy. The other bummer is that paid games are mixed in with the other games and the kids had a hard time telling which was which so they tried swiping multiple times. These games should be more clearly labeled as \"extra\" because the kids don't understand.   The kids loved the virtual machine by the air hockey tables with the roller coaster. They did that twice in one hour.   My kids are 9 and 7 and I compare this place to John's pizza, Dave & Busters and Peter Piper. I would say that I frequent all of these places because of the age of my kids and they are all pretty close to this location. John's is still my favorite and is the least expensive without any passes. We will frequent Game works because it is on the POGO pass for 3 visits in a year. We didn't eat because there are so many other options in Town Square especially for kids.",

The staff was super friendly and accommodating from the room reservation woman Megan to the person greeting us, the managers, our server, everyone! For the price we got an hour and a half in the room for gift opening, pinata which we brought ourselves, cake and food.  We were able to bring our own decor but since it was raining we brought very little. They also provided some balloons, table coveralls, plates, napkins, and untesils!!  We bought the fiesta package and was more than enough to feed everyone and even to bring some lefts overs home. They give you 10 cards for 1 hour play and for rewards at the gift shop. My son had so much fun and everyone we invited had a really great time! So glad I chose Gameworks for this milestone birthday celebration!!",

While he was playing games I was able to watch the football game on all their great TV screens.   One of the reasons why I give them 5 stars is because of it's location. It located in Town Square and they a lot of things to do for all ages in the area. Above GameWorks is a movie theater.   I recommend this place on a football Sunday :) because they have all the games playing and its a great place for kids, and if you have  wife have her go shopping since they have a lot great shopping stores near by.

The retail  price of credits is $0.25 and quite a few of the games are 8 or more credits, which makes them two bucks a shot.  Granted, if you spend more money you can get more credits at a cheaper price, but  it is just a crazy expensive place with not much more value than any other arcade.  Would I go back? Not with a Dave and Busters near my home...I didn't need to drive from Cali to Vegas to go here...and now I know...  So what do I do with all the extra tickets on this card?  Just find a Dave and Busters and it's good across the US.  Kids had a decent time but w the cost of the games these days, there are better places to go if you have limited time in Vegas.

Sometimes the card allows you to play, but won't give you tickets. They had almost every type of game to play such as video old school arcade games,pin ball, virtual racing, air hockey, bowling, live xbox, pool table, basket ball shooting, etc...they also have a restaurant and bar. It has plenty seating. This place is good for meeting friends and having drinks. It's crowded during the weekends,but best time to go if you're an adult is Sun-Thurs after kids curfew 10pm. This allows you to play almost all the games, when it's crowded it becomes stuffy and hot, so dress lightly. Food and drinks are inexpensive, no coins are needed, you just buy a preloaded card and play as much as what you purchased. I hadn't had that much fun in years, that it left my hand and arm sore lol! Hats off to them for bringing kids, adults, and families out, and having a fun place to interact.",

There are literally huge holes in the seats, where you can see all the filthy foam inside. Less than half of the basketball games were on, and there were only 3 balls in each, so you waste a lot of time waiting for the balls to be returned. A lot of the 2-player shooting games are missing one gun,so you can't play them together.   They finally  got a dark ride, and I have always loved that attraction. It's fun, but too short. I'm glad I got to try it here while it's still new, before it looks like the rest of the building.   I'm not sure how this place went down hill so fast, but it looks depressing in there, and it's pretty gross. I probably won't be going back.",

Upon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22.   On Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy.",

    "text": "Had a great time playing games and the staff in the front is friendly, then came time for my family to get dinner at the Gameworks restaurant. We went over and the first employee we saw just stood there and looked at us before pretending she didn't see us, so I asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves. She said no, that we would be seated by \"them\". She actually walked us around the corner to where someone would take us to a table and give us menus, only she stood there talking to the two people who were there for a while. One of the other people finally looked over and asked if we wanted a table, we said yes and she said \"oh\". Then she went back to what she'd been doing when we first showed up. Finally, she got us some menus and took us to our table, where we sat and waited a while for someone to come over just to get drink orders. It wasn't even busy there, maybe four tables with patrons and they had a staff of at least six, not counting the kitchen. Just some side notes; the table they sat us at was not clean, it took forever for someone to take out order, the order was mixed up a bit by the server, and it took a while to get our bill. The food was pretty decent, but the service sucked. When we left, we got some dirty looks from the staff members we'd  had interaction with, probably because I didn't feel compelled to leave extra money for the awful service. Instead, I left a note kindly asking them to improve their service. It was the best tip I could give them, since I've worked in customer service most of my adult life.",

    "text": "My sons and I used to come here all the time. Pretty good selection of games to play. Within the past year or so, there has been a severe lack of game maintenance taking place. Several of the multiplayer games consistently have broken down units. Mario Kart (our favorite) has been broken for almost a year, yet Gameworks has no problem letting people attempt to play the game - One of the steering wheels is almost non-responsive, and it makes the game completely unplayable. The other unit next to it has a seat that is stuck in a forward position. I went to talk to someone about this, and her answer was \"it cost money to fix these games\". Well, no sh*t. I think we're done with Gameworks. Unfortunately, I just purchased a Groupon recently that I haven't even used. It will probably go to waste. Dave & Buster's is close by, and has Mario Kart. Dave & Buster's doesn't have a couple of the other games that game works has, but I can't remember the last time the other games had both player options working and available at Gameworks anyway.",

When they called me about the bowling party (it took a few times for us to finally get in touch) they asked me to pick two colors for party decor. 3 days before the party, they ask if we want to add any other guests or party platters.  The party was $25/kid and included 90 minutes of bowling, shoe rental, party decor, pizza, cookies, & soft drinks. Each person who RSVPd also got a one hour game card that they could start whenever they wanted, as long as it was the day of the party.   There was a lot of seating & tables for all of the guests. There was even a separate table for presents. Our party of ~20 kids got 3 lanes to bowl. The food that came with the package was good enough for the kids + a few parents. The only extra food we ordered were nachos.   Ebony was our server and she was so patient and friendly with our big group of 8-11 year olds.   A few things you should know: The party does not come with invites; however the manager Janai sent me their logo to work with for some 'DIY' invites. Their goodie bags are very pricey at $5/kid, but again, Janai kindly let us bring our own.   Overall, the experience was a fun one and I wouldn't have booked anywhere else this year.",

First off there was no changing table in the family restroom to change both of my sons diapers. Luckily I have my Phil & Teds stroller to convert into a changing table. second of all some of the games here are not well maintained. for instance the basketball hoops the staff does not ensure that each basketball hoops stall has basketballs. Most of the basketballs were gathered into one basketball stall. also the machines that are damaged keep taking the credits from the game card. Thus making it's an inconvenience in having to contact a staff member to reload the credits. I feel this place is not meant for toddlers as there are very little game choices for them.",

    "text": "Saw a Groupon special for these guys. 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card. I immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10. Thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday. Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that's not my gripe.  My gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.  I also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade.   After about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?  I am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here. You guys should change your name to \"Gameswork\". Because after coming here I am left scratching my head thinking do any of the \"Games Work?\"  Yelp 2015 Review #36 \"Gameworks?.........Sometimes.\" 535 overall",

She is very sweet and she helped me choose the best party for my daughter.  We ordered the \"Game On\" package for 10 kids. The bowling was a major hit!! The bowling area is quite intimate with only 8 lanes. And there was more than enough food and drinks that my husband, my stepson and I were also able to eat, even tho we hadn't intended on it. Adrian was our \"party attendant\". What an AWESOME GUY!!! He kept the drinks coming without having to ask and was extremely attentive. He even spoke to a manager about putting an extra 25 minutes back on the \"clock\" for bowling because some of the kids were late so they lost 20 mins. of bowling time while we waited. He also complimented my husband and I on how wonderful the kids were. And was amazed that the kids cleaned up the bowling area before they left for their hour play in the arcade. He said he rarely sees adults do that after a party. Daisy and Jacob where also wonderful! Made us feel so welcome. That being said, the only bad part of the night was the arcade. There were quite a few games that were not working and it was really kind of a bummer for the kids because the arcade was pact and their hour went quick with not a lot of game play. They spent more time walking around looking for a game then playing in that hour. It was a disappointment to me and especially the kids. A couple times a game stopped working in the middle of them playing it and it was extremely difficult to find anyone to help so they just walked away. I wish the arcade attendants were as attentive and available as Adrian, Jacob and Daisy. If more of the games had been working, this review would have received 5+++ stars! If we go back and the arcade is working better then I will definitely change my review . Thank you Megan and Adrian for taking such good care of my daughter and her friends!! A \"Sweet 16\" birthday only comes around once",

We had a party room reserved for our staff. We were served soda, salad, pasta(yuck), pizzas, and cookies. Pizza was just ok- lacked flavor, but I bet they don't want it too spicy for all the kiddos that come in.  I played the games for over an hour stopping to go back to the party room to eat more food. Pinball and basketball were my favorites. Many games were broken which is understandable with all the people pulling, pushing, and poking on the machines.  I was my own driver so I did not get a drink from the bar, but I like the idea that there is a kid free zone @ GameWorks.",

My husband and I played for a couple of hours before deciding we need a break so we headed over to the bar. We were served by Chrystal. She was absolutely amazing, so friendly and customer service oriented. We chatted for a bit and I truly appreciated her friendliness, conversation and work ethic.

I went to games works on Thursday August 8th and was greeted upon entry I made my way to the bar and it wasn't too busy there were two lovely ladies behind the bar I laughed because I see the name tags and smiles I will not forget BEE and Chalupa! They were so relaxed and just fun to chat with. Told me about specials and great perks they have to offer. It was a nice day to come in and relax let the kids run around and get out of this crazy heat. We live in California and I used to go to Gameworks when I was younger so I'm so glad my kids got to experience the same Joy. Keep up the good work girls you made my experience a great one!

Half the games here were broken or falling apart on my last visit. What was once a hot spot in Town Square and on the main strip (strip location closed!) is now dead dead dead. The games that were working were outdated. And the ticket to prize currency?! Don't get me started. These poor kiddos (or more like their parents who are paying for the games) are getting completely ripped off. I remember getting much bigger, better prizes here as a kid. When did ticket currency drop so hard?!  Avoid GameWorks at all costs, but if you do come here use a Groupon. Park at the West end of Town Square.",

Nestled in the far back, at Town Square it is a hop skip and jump from the strip. But without all the foot traffic that crowds the strip. When you visit GameWorks it is located in an air conditioned large space where one does not have to worry about the sun until you leave!  The games that they offer here are great with a wonderful mix of Star Wars first player games, those famous cycle and driving games to sharpen going around that curve just right.   This establishment is not just for children. Parents with children of all ages can come and enjoy all GameWorks has to offer. I have come here alone and with my twins when we're having family day. There is wonderful games where the family can all play the same game together or even play billiards as a family.  It is standard practice to purchase the red game card here for the best deal, I believe. I always load up with $20-50 and that will usually last a couple of hours. They have an email special that when you sign up they will give the guest a $10 game play no strings attached! Plus being part of the GameWorks email club they send all sorts of deals to your email that are very sweet.   For those of us that are over 21 and need libations they have that covered too! They have a full service bar here! The bartender that took my order today was from Dublin and had an amazing accent. There are adults only pool here in the bar area.  This trip I did not eat off of the menu, but have in the past. The food here is pretty good. With a lot of the entree purchase there is an option to score a free game play card too! These are wonderful deals too!   Now come on and get out of the heat and get your game on Vegas!",

I got the nachos with chicken and didn't realize when they came out they came out like trash can nachos at Guy Fieri's place in the Rio. These nachos had a mix of tortilla chips and Doritos chips so it made for some good flavoring. My husband got the Gameworks burgers and he loved the sauce on it.

It's been 15 minutes barside and you try to yell the attendant's name again, but your kids are back for a third time tugging at your legs. They'd blown through the second round of $50 in just ten minutes and are ready for the next $50. Now your barside, alone, drink-less, and $150 in.

When we tried to redeem them, the manager told us that she couldn't redeem them unless we had a \"PIN number\" when we purchased the gift cards, we were not given or told about any PIN number. And she proceeded to have us call a customer service number that of course didn't have a person available. She tried to remedy the situation by given us passes that only worked on a few sgames and wouldn't give us any tickets whatsoever. They obviously were trying to scam us out of our 50 dollars. Never buy any gift cards for GameWorks, they WILL NOT HONOR THEM. Another thing, many games were out of order and dirty. Well thanks for nothing GameWorks my family really loved having our day ruined. In the future I'll be taking my business to Dave and Busters not this money grabbing clone.  Update we got pins a few months later, the manager was nice enough to respond a while back (I recently saw the notification) but we don't really have any reason to go back because of our experience prior. I do appreciate that the manager reached out but we don't have any reason to come back soon and won't end up using the cards",

They just recently updated their games but there is still room for improvement in this area as well as a lot of games are out of order anytime I come. This is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5.  On the flip side they offer deals almost every day of the week like 3 hours of unlimited game play for $20 or $10 Thursday which makes for a cheap night if you have kids and you want to get them out of the house or if you just want to go chill in a laid back atmosphere.  They have a bowling alley with great prices and well as a internet gaming lounge so there is literally something for everyone. The food is average so don't go in expecting a save and busters type of food but it is nice to be able to grab a bite and watch some games in between playing some games",

Nikita somehow managed to attend to the long bar of customers with kindness and sincerity despite the fact that he was on his own and his cash register was around the corner providing a terrible line of sight for him. Improper bar staffing and poor register placement is clearly a management issue that should be improved to ease up pressure of such critical staff members like Nikita. In fact, my husband and I walked past the floor manager who neglected to make eye contact, greet us or acknowledge our presence at all. Additionally, many of the games did not accept our fully funded cards or properly fund tickets. A small annoyance that was eased by the GameWorks staff. Take good care of your amazing staff. Their your best asset at this point. Overall a fun break in between flights. I recommend opening a GameWorks at all airports.",

The only location I have actually seen is this location in Las Vegas. This establishment is located in the Town Square Las Vegas ( on the corner of S Las Vegas Blvd and W Sunset Road.  The entire mall area is very appealing it looks like it is well kept and maintained. The GameWorks is located next to a Guitar Center. When you are ready to play the games you get a plastic card in which you purchase credits on. Each game has a certain amount of credits used in order to play. You  can earn points towards a prize and cash in before you leave. This location has a Arcade, Restaurant, Bar, Bowling, and ESports. I can only comment on the Arcade and ESports. I enjoy the Super Shot Basketball, Dark Escape 4D, Air Hockey, Aliens Armageddon and Star Wars. My son loves the ESports center he told me that the computer gaming system is really good. ( Alien Ware ) - decent set-up . Fortnite is the game of choice. A lot of variety of games are offered on the system. This gaming area is fairly large. Me and my wife recently went to a show , and dropped my son off at this location, he met up with his cousin and they spent a few hours there. It's a nice place to hang out , especially for KIDS.

Not much more to see.  The food was terrible and considering there was only one other family there you would think they could do a better job. My caesars salad was soaked with dressing and soggy. The chicken was okay. My husbands fish and chips were dripping with old oil.. But the kids seemed to like the chicken strips and French fries. I think the only thing that was okay to me was the calamari and aioli dip.  The rides/ games were extremely over priced. However  at least the service was excellent. Laura our waitress was great and made sure we never had to ask for a refill. She was the one bright spot.  We don't have plans to go back.. Rather wait til we travel to a place that has a Dave and busters.",

Got the chocolate molten cake for desert as that should be hard to screw up, however that was cold and not molten.  I'm not going to describe the words for the cake. I would recommend eating elsewhere and then come here to play games.",

One second they are catering to adults with drinks and low budget tv's and steps away they are catering to 5 year old children. The bar and arcade are a very weird mix in such a small space.  This is a classic example of a jack of all trades, master of none.  If this is a restaurant /bar, there are better ones 25 feet away and if this is an arcade for children, this is Las Vegas and Circus Circus runs circles around it. I expected that this was going to be a very cool, new and innovative arcade center for all ages and was really excited for something new and different to arrive but was disappointed to say the least and would never go back. I could improve this place with my eyes closed.",

Lines for a lot of games and not many choices to pick and play from made it not fun. Will not be coming back spent 27$ for 20 min of very annoying and frustrating entertainment.

The Seattle location puts this place to shame.  We got two hours of free play, but half the games were not working.   I paid $54 for 400 credits for future use.  The menu looks appetizing, but way too expensive.  I got one draft beer and it was $7!  The best part of this location?  It is right across the sidewalk from Yard House.  We will likely use GameWorks as entertainment for our kids while my wife and I hit happy hour at Yard House.  Unless they come up with a happy hour with major discounts, I will never buy food or drink here.  Without drastic improvements this location will become the hangout for kids waiting for their movie at AMC, and that will mean once my 400 credits run out, my card will be permanently filed in the circular canister.",

It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games.",

    "text": "This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.  The dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.  The Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.  In closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well.",

Started off at the bar asked for 2 double  drinks which was $30 (thought it was pricey but didn't over think it) paid walked away went to eat and more then half the food was under cooked sent it back appreciate the 6 free passes by the way (cause yes that's how crappy the food was) we let it go went back to the bar got another double Drink (only one) this time only $10 I asked the bartender why the last round was $30 for two? He said he didn't know he wasn't the one who did it..I wasn't mad about it though like ok well it's cheaper whatever..went back a third time got another double and it was $14!! What's up with the inconsistency plus the pour was much shorter..brought it up to the bartender showed him the receipts and he went off about me wanting another shot so he gave it to me and said I got you another shot let it go....like really! It's not about me wanting another shot it's the fact that you can't get your prices or pours right and can't even acknowledge the fact that you guys obviously don't know what your doing!! Workers need more training for a place like this I'd think customer service would be better. (Corporate that is)",

    "text": "Took my 6 year old here for some kid fun. It was was better than the gameworks that use to be on the strip near the mgm. This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.  She liked it and I like that she liked it. I like that its right there in town square too. What a nice location. Convenient and also smart because they probably get a lot of teenagers and or kids cause its right near the movie theater and town square is pretty busy most of the time.",

My BF and I were playing a game and a lady approached and set her child down on the game next to us. He started crawling over to get to our game.. He even picked up our balls and while playing this fast paced game I hit him with my elbow. Complete accident. I did not think this lady was partially challenged enough to allow her child to run wild. I told her to move her child or it'll happen again, he's not my responsibility. She threw back some shade, so I told her to learn to be a mother. Later my BF and I are at the bar and he is standing next to me. The lady came by as if she was about to exit. She took her styrofoam cup and threw her drink on my BF. I got up and threatened her damn life. We called management and he had said she is here almost everyday and let's her kid run around and he felt too bad to kick her out. Mind you, she isn't paying to play ANYTHING. End of story, he comped us some games and the bartender was cool enough to comp us a drink. Well, I'm here right now and she's still here doing the same thing. So if you're homeless or broke feel free to lurk around here and not spend money. Oh and bring all your kids so they feel bad and let you stay!",

The rollercoaster simulator was really fun. The restaurant and bar had friendly staff members. Typical bar food, but it was ok. You can walk around the whole place with your beer or cocktail. I don't think they need such a large dining area.",

I don't feel like typing it all out again, but basically I'm giving the place five stars because I think it's a great addition to TS, and you can make a fun night of it between AMC, this, and Blue Martini. You could spend hours at TS because of those three places. Yes, some games were broken, but I'll give them a few months to work out the glitches. I also see the arcade expanding in the future because the restaurant doesn't seem to be that popular, but the rest of the arcade is. Peace.",

This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.",

My partner found his favorite game (some shooter game where you sit in a booth, and you're a pirate fighting undead pirates), and we initially started having a blast. Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too.   After getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses).   Oh, and beers are $8 and up (I thought Town Square was a local's place, not the actual Strip), and the girl at the ticket counter said he average cost of a play was 4-9 credits. Sure. In the kid's area. The rest was at least 10 credits a play. One play. No multiple lives, or more than one shot in the kid's area.",

You can swing by and even watch some of the large tournaments. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Nats Qualifier, League of Legends LCS qualifier, and have nightly tournaments. Specifically, Veronica, Nancy, and Marlon are some of their all-stars. Their team is too fantastic to name them all, but I can not praise them enough.

You have to remember that this is a place for the kiddos so it will be crazy/loud etc. If that gets to be too much, they do have adult beverages. In case you haven't been to an arcade since the 80s, they now have cards onto which they load 30, 60 minutes etc. of play time. So you can leave the quarters at home!   I've been here a few times for various events, and for my birthday last year after they sent me a deal for free gaming for up to 6 people for 30 minutes and a birthday treat from the restaurant for me! That worked out as I had visitors in town who were up for some free video gaming. I'm a skee ball fan and also prefer the racing games (of which they have a few here) and so that was an enjoyable birthday stop!",

The guy in the suit n red tie who supposedly is the Manager tells us they keep changing rules like dude if your the manager your supposed to be up to date on the policys and the rules and tell customer whats going on. The .manager told us we can bowl until 1am but didnt mean to mention that we have to switch lanes and switch pur spots. We were posted at the end of the bowling lanes at lane 8 and I've been tipping the servers a lot they know me and you want to ruin it by saying there's a line of people. If im paying my money because I thought I would have this spot for the night and you tell me we have to stop and move to smother lane thats not right. Ive been HERE more than 3 hours waiting for the sppt and place to enjoy my time with my family.",

    "text": "Pretty cool spot for a night out with friends or a day with the family. There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer/video games. Games for everyone!   They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree.   There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!!   Cool spot again to drink and play games, maybe dine at another nearby establishment though.",

Our food also took forever and one of the orders was wrong. We will not be back to eat maybe we'll check out another restaurant in town square before hitting up the games at game works",

With bowling alley, bar and dining area in back. The venue is big lots of room to move around. Customer service is friendly and good overall. Usually highschool kids or young gamers work the floor. The food was your typical bar food. Nothing special. Service in the dining area was very good.",

    "text": "Facility is similar to a Dave and Busters but with a larger arcade area and a bar instead of restaurant.  Games: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.  People: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. \"Every man from himself\" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.  (Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)  Arcade is for family which is great but the parents aren't gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.  Staff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.  Come here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it.",

    "text": "GameWorks is back in town and I am happy. I'm not much of a gamer myself but coming here brings the inner kid out of me. Here is my take on the place.  Location: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory.   Interior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.  Staff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy. The staff at the ticket counter were good and helped us get the correct amount of points on our card after a machine error.  We will be back soon to try the glow in the dark things and as the drinks are $2 cheaper than Mcfaddens which is upstairs.",

    "text": "Review of the New GameWorks Las Vegas by Mother of three boys.  I signed up online for GameWorks rewards program a week before we left on our trip and received a free $10 game play in my email inbox (sweet) My first impression of the new town square location was that the shopping center had plenty of parking and high end shops and out door play spaces for kids. Inside the Facility seems much cleaner, and brighter than the old basement style location on the strip, that we had visited for years prior to it closing.  This location seems much less busy right at the opening versus in the afternoon hours on the weekends.  The Party/Restaurant area: We had drove from out of state to celebrated my oldest' s birthday here. Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area.  We chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not!  There was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou. There is no dedicated \"kids menu\". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it's your first time getting a card).  However the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid \"Yelper\" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed!  I had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.         Inside the Arcade: Family friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station. However no place within this bathroom to toss a dirty diaper, other than the tiny hand towel basket? (Hopefully they invest in a solution in the future) For kids of all ages; The game floor seems to consist of several \"zones\": Many large ride on/in games, A row of bloody shoot up games , Massive flashy ticket games, A \"eSports\" LAN room which is quiet, dark and filled with a gamers wildest dreams worth of P.Cs and gaming systems, and lastly the bowling ally ( which I will go into more detail on later). GameWorks did not disappoint with more than enough things to keep everyone entertained for five amazing hours that just flew by. We had so much fun on the floor with timed cards we returned on the 15th for a second day, to allow for time in the eSports room for my older boys.  eSports/ Bowling Alley: I inquired about the package options here as well for his party next year, and decided that's what we will plan for, for next time because of the value and option of pc based games like Minecraft.  While here they spent 2 hours playing diablo 3 and mine craft. Overall all boys had to be dragged out in the end they were having such a good time, look forward to many visits in years to come!",

By the way I did not know that he was the manager until after my order was fixed.       . I tried to tell Joseph which computer My brother, son and I was sitting.  We waited about 30 mins for a personal size looking pizza.  Nick came and check on us 2 times as he always makes his rounds around the cafe every time I've visted.  Finally I asked for his help which he got done faster than Joseph has. Nick completely took care of my brother and son after. But he is just a great up beat worker overall every time we have gone into game works he has been helpful and always checking on the kids. Great and attentive.  Joseph it was nice giving me the reason why things weren't done. BUT NICK GOT THEM DONE FOR US. As well as the other 2 employees that was with him.",

Would never eat here again or recommend it to anybody. Food was also substandard, tasted only mildly better than gas station prepared food and was far more expensive. After everything was said and done the only concession given was a 20% reduction on the check as well as a card for games in the arcade which didn't work in half the machines because the readers on the arcade games were faulty, it would take several tries to get the card to read on many of the machines if we could get it to read at all.",

I was greeted by Carlos, the manager, who told me that Alex and V (can't remember her full name) would take good care of us. They had amazing service and as we were playing Halo 5 I noticed V handle a group of loitering obnoxious teens (I rarely use this word, I'm still a big kid) like a pro. They made sure we were taken good care of. Well done everyone, will be back for sure. Very happy with my time spent there tonight.",

It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.  Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as \"Family Friendly\" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths. Filthy Mouths and Filthy Minds shouldn't be serving your family food.",

    "text": "Oh Gameworks. When will I learn to stop holding you to such high, reasonable, expectations...  My first awful experience with this place was back in January of 2015. We went for my little brother's birthday, and he was super excited to win a prize from the arcade. When we told our waiter this, he offered us the all you can play for 2 hours pass, and we thought: \"perfect, we can earn a bunch of tickets and get him something fun!\" It wasn't until the two hours ended and we tried to redeem our tickets that we were informed we did not win any tickets, the pass just gave us unlimited game play. My brother was heartbroken, and we walked out empty handed, and when we complained to the front desk they refused to do anything for us, and told us we should have specifically asked the waiter. What?! I wrote this same review on their facebook page, and management never responded. I have sworn off going here since then, but last night I decided to give it another shot since my fiance wanted to play some games for his birthday.   I would give this experience two stars as well. A lot of games were not working, and the games that did work were EXPENSIVE. I get that it's in a tourist-y area, but really? 9 credits for one game where you don't get a substantial amount of tickets? It's not like the prizes you offer are anymore reasonably priced, and the cheap prizes are dollar store things.   Also, management decided it would be advantageous to dust their ceiling off as my fiance and I were standing right next to them. We were playing a game when dust just came pouring down on us - seriously?! You couldn't warn us first? Afterwards, when we walked away, the manager made eye contact with us, saw us covered in dust, and didn't say anything. I was appalled.   I have tried to like this place, but I just can't. I know D&B has had some issues in it's first few weeks, but I would rather spend my time there then spend anymore time at Gameworks - they've been open for at least two years and they still can't get it together.",

    "text": "Recently discovered that my 11YO enjoys playing pool, briefly considered getting him a fake ID so we can hit up PTs. Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool.    Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills.    Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.  There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important.    Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice \"I'm over my man cave\" Craig's list second hand-me-down.   Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience.   I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind.    If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you.    In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that.",

The nachos came out at a decent time but the rolls came out after we were about finished eating. We had to wait another 20 mins for the waiter to get back with our bill so we could leave.

We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one. In sum, we had a great time and will be back for more fun.",

It's very expensive but you can save a lot by purchasing time cards, this seems to be the way forward with any 'swipe card' location.  Machines at this location are generally quite new, however, games can be out of order for months! I have no idea what the techs get up to here, but it certainly isn't machine fixing! When I ask for help fixing a game, they just put my credit back on my card and avoid the problem. Emailing the manager gets results, but we shouldn't have to right?!  Food is pretty good actually, for bar food. Spending $15 can get you a 2 hour game card, so this is the way to go. They also have bowling and a gaming lounge, not my scene personally, but it's there!  I give this location a 2 out of 5 due to the price and poor machine fixing. I will alter my review of this gets sorted out in the future",

However, as far as having a \"host\" for the event wasn't worth the cost. I spent most of the time looking for him, asking for things that should have been already taken care of. (i.e. tables for cake and gifts, refills on drinks, napkins, and plates, cookies). As soon as he brought what we needed he was gone. He was very polite but maybe not trained properly or busy with other guests. We probably would celebrate here again but just sit in the dining area.",

Usually when us as adults that accompany a minor to these gaming places, is as adults would like to eat some good food while the young ones are playing. Cause even if they (kids) come or time to eat they don't care if it's good they actually rather play games then take a break to eat. So I recommend this play to bring the kids too to play. 4 stars only cause it was hard to find this place. This place is not where the google gbs says it is. It's actually in the far back side next to the 15frw not Las Vegas blvd. Pls don't park in the front cause the walk is nearly two football fields long. Horrible.",

I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza.   Location: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards.   Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.  Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something.",

Anyways I've been to this location more than a few times and honestly I like it.  They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.  Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.  Seems like a great place for families and people of all ages. Haven't had a bad experience yet and customer service has always been great. I'll definitely be back.",

A group of my friends came here after buying the Groupon deal for all day arcade play.   The bar was such a nightmare. I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left.   They had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken. More often than not, one of the two controller would not work.  This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders.",

    "text": "I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs.\" That's pretty generous.  I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.  Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.  I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be consTrued as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.  I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.  As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.  I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.  I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "Skip that place-that-shall-not-be-named and try your kid's party here. Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us.   For food, we went with:  - Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it  -Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect  -Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite  -Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed  Overall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!  We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.  As far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party.",

Not going to send them back again. Granted, the fries, even plain were good fries. The chicken wings were delicious, got 3 flats, no drummettes. The mozzarella cheese sticks were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. Did not need any marinara. Stuffed fried raviolis were not good imo. I can't explain it just that the beef didn't taste like beef. Chicken fingers were good. Grilled cheese was good but the quesadillas were dissappointing. The potstickers were good in flavor but maybe need a little longer in the fryer as the inside was cool and mushy. The fish and chips were perfect. Wish they had tartar sauce or malt vinegar to go with but they don't. Our server brought us an aioli sauce that was pretty tasty with the fish. We ordered waffle fries to go with it but they were really hard. I recommend sticking with regular fries. Also, I want to point out that our server Courtnie was courteous and polite and when I sent back the parmesan fries, I asked her not to take the entire platter of apps back with her so we could start eating as we were starved. As we were asking for our bill, a large party of about 9 people were seated next to us. By the time we paid our check and we're leaving, maybe 15-20 minutes, they were already eating. Not sure why we were unlucky to have to wait so long.   Games: 40% of the games we wanted to play were out of order. We played the Pacman air hockey game a few times and it was great fun but when we went back to play it again it was out of order. Sucks because my daughter is limited to what she can play due to being in a wheelchair. Lots of the games require you to transfer into a seat or are on a platform that isn't accessible and those that aren't were limited due to so many being out of order. I was happy to see Pinball machines and show my kids how to play it. I believe there were 6 machines but only 3 were working properly. We ended up leaving with 416 minutes of unlimited play still on our card.",

    "text": "Arcade fun that ranks up there with the best Vegas has to offer, with the price tag to match. I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story.   GameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square.   After enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.  The games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.  The staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.  Prices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.  The hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.  All that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age). Imagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...  All in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive.",

    "text": "Last night we celebrated my husband's nephew's birthday here, per his request. The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare.   We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table.   I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards.   I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all.   BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well.   1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket.   I did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family.",

I would say about 30% of the machines didn't even work, I got \"jipped\" on a 250 ticket \"jackpot\" that only ended up giving me 20 tickets on the bigger version of the ball drop game.   Half of the basketball games in the row were out of order. The cashier that rung me up was rude and didn't give me my card back right away. I think they forgot to turn the A/C on because it was like a sauna in there.   I would not recommend coming here at all. I'd say go to circus circus, the pinball hall of fame,Dave & Busters and even the Excalibur arcade is better than what they call this (because it's not an arcade in my opinion).   If I could give 0 stars, I definitely would.",

Once we were done bowling we decided to go play the arcade games .. half of them didn't work- they had signs all over the place on the games saying they weren't working. They had a 3D experience you could go into but of course that wasn't working, a bunch of simulators weren't working, the luigi game was missing the gun for player 2 and the list goes on. This place was a joke.   The staff seemed to be used to it because if a machine took our credits they didn't even hesitate to put more on our card for us. They need to spend some money on fixing these machines- from the reviews it seems like they've been down for a while now.",

Tables in the dining area were nearly empty. Service was still almost nonexistent! When the waitress did come by, she was very laissez faire. She took orders and some items never came. We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people!   Food is nothing to rave about. Typical quick fried and cooked food: burgers, fries, pizza, appetizers, salads... Plenty of tvs played sports. Plentynof tables for large groups. Side bar area for adults.  Game room is a bit stuffy. Games could be updated. One side room has a few bowling lanes. Another is dimly lit, quiet, and has computers for virtual game play. Kids loved it.",

We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to.    This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators. Gameworks you are located in one of the highest rent districts in all of Las Vegas.  You have come up with away to quickly ROI for the $500,000 in equipment you purchased.  Take a lesson from the nightclub industry the way to make money is on the booze.  Bottle Service!!! and VIP AREA!!!  The funnest game they had was the Pac Man air hockey.  We could have played this the whole time.  We will be back. It might be a while but we will.  Good luck to you Gameworks.  I appreciate what you bring to the valley, unlike all the other HATER SUPER GEEKS out there.",

My favorites were pinball, skeeball, basketball, and Mario cart. I wish they had more games and serviced them more; but I had a blast just gaming! Bought a soda at the bar and it took forever to get the one server's attention, so I opted not to buy food. Liked that they had sports games on site as well as bowling. Plenty of parking and great for all ages. Clean bathrooms too! Would recommend for adults and kids alike!!!!",

The meal took a little while to be served but the service was great. While waiting we realized that the television was uncomfortable to watch at times because the contrast was WAY too high.  After our meal we bought game cards. First, we had to buy a new card that was $2 and then the actual credits range from ($5-$50) and then if you want to supersize the amount of credits you get, that's an extra $2 dollars as well. The prices of the credits weren't too bad but to actually enjoy yourself, you have to spend at least $20 due to how much credits each game takes. Overall GameWorks is SUPER fun and I'll definitely be back.",

Here's why Star is low , because when I got a credit back from manager from a broken game , he made no effort to place a sign on game so the next person wouldn't get ripped off. If I was close to game, I would tell a gamer not to play, but throughout time I was there , I saw several kids getting ripped off, but they would just walk away, I guess the manager knew that someone like me, asking for credit back was rare , so he was making money by just leaving game unfixed. Place stinks with odor, workers seem to not care, and manager acts like he's to good for his job. This place is just 'Hype'.",

As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I'm not sure which \"package\" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left.  Thanks Gameworks!",

NOTHING like any other Gameworks you've ever been to...  We should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font.   While waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery.   The food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food.    I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.     We will never be going back here and my prediction is that it will be closed within a year unless some SERIOUS changes are made.",

It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people.

    "text": "If you're not into the whole bar scene or looking for a way to kill time in Town Square then check this place out.   This new location is much smaller than the previous one located on the strip, however, you can still find something that everyone will like. The main gaming area has games that I haven't seen in any other Las Vegas arcades including ticket, shooter, driving, 4D, old school and Japanese games. They even have Purikura inside! There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren't located next to the games so it's nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster's).  The only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with \"points.\" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour. We were offered this deal when a friend bought a drink at the bar so I'm not sure if a drink purchase is required.",

    "text": "first visit to this location at Town Square last time I went to Gameworks, it used to be a huge location by the MGM  had to meet a client here.....yes she had kids, so had to keep them busy!  this location was a lot smaller than the one that was by the MGM, but was a good place to meet....especially since they have alcohol!  ordered a pretty pathetic looking pizza, with game card of course! ....looked bad, but the kids scarfed it down, so who am I to judge, right?  for adults, we ordered a salad with ranch....just ok a philly cheesesteak sandwhich....again, just ok, meat kind of dry and a spinach artichoke dip, again just ok  service was good, and we got to let the kiddies run amok in the game area, so that made it nice  don't think I would come here aside from needing to keep kids occupied though wasn't anything special food wise, but they do have a full bar, so that is a plus",

    "text": "I am only reviewing the arcade as I haven't tried the restaurant or bowling. Alot of arcades seem to be taking that approach these days (i.e. Round 1, KDB, Latitude 39). I came here for a Smash 4 Tournament and tried the arcade out between my sets. The game selection is small like many reviewers already stated, but the games they do have work well. They even have a Pump It Up Infinity that works amazingly well. I would like to see more Japanese games out here like Beatmania and Pop n' Music since the Gemini arcade palace closed. Overall, Gameworks Las Vegas is a small, underrated arcade that deserves more positive attention than it is getting.",

You can play those games, however the kids do not get tickets. What a rip off. The kids were pissed and do not want to go back.  It was not explained to us by the waitress nor do any of the signs mention this little caveat.",

I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.",
