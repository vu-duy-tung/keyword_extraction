From the fresh ingredients to the presentation everything was absolutely top notch. Fried green tomatoes were a taste treat that reminded one of home... only better. The biscuits and gravy were a surprisingly light  comfort food. It is a great destination for a personalized dining experience off the strip. We will be going back there again.",

I'm pretty sure almost everyone is related and they are all nice. I also love the fact that I don't have to drive to the strip and pay for parking. These people know what they are doing. I almost didn't want to write this review because others would find out about it. But, I also want them to stay in business.",

    "text": "Gotta love it when the chef personally meets and greets his dining guests after he cooks the meal! Not that I needed any changes made to my order, but I'm sure he'd be willing to accommodate to any modifications. His eggs benedict was one of the best I've ever had for breakfast, and I think I'll be skipping lunch and possibly dinner too because of how filling the meal was. The eggs were perfectly poached the way I liked (meaning that when I popped the center with my fork, the yolk gushed out in all its glorious-gooey creaminess), and even though I prefer thin bacon, the thicker and meatier bacon that came with the eggs was very flavorful.  The side of breakfast potatoes were just as tasty, lightly salted, and slightly crisp.  I wish I didn't have to wait a several more hours for my stomach to digest before I can dig into the homemade cinnamon roll that I also ordered to-go... Look for Zenaida's Cafe right next to the State Farm insurance office.  The outside of the cafe doesn't really stand out among the other businesses in the shopping plaza where it's located, but the food inside sure does!  Support the small chef-owned eateries and give Zenaida's cafe a try!  Sooo, a few weeks later... I went back to grab just a small lunch of chicken wings and a side of fries, but my 'quickie' lunch turned into a mini feast of 2 generous portions of freshly cooked fries (I didn't know plain fries came with my order of wings, but the garlic rosemary fries were too tempting to pass up), 7 pieces of succulent, Southern style wings with hot sauce and homemade bbq sauce on the side, and an unexpected complimentary cookies n cream (thank-you-Chef-for-ruining-my-diet) dessert which I gladly made extra room for in my already full stomach!  Next time, I'll be ordering the cookies n cream to go because otherwise, I won't have the stomach space to sample everything else on the menu!",

The smoked salmon was on point and the blend of capers , onions , tomato and cheese was sooooo good! My friend had the pancakes and she was enjoying them; when we were presented with a pudding that was sinfully rich , topped with a delicate mix of sweet and spice ; it was like tasting a holiday . Compliments of the chef ! We couldn't believe it ! We were honored and happy to have such a wonderful experience at this hidden gem away from the loud busy crowded tourist spots. Service was efficient , attentive , and personalized . Quiet place , feels like home , music ranges from upbeat to chill and relaxed. Bohemian decor invites you to have some coffee , read your favorite book and maybe strike up a conversation with a kindred spirit . Outdoor sitting is dog friendly, which was also a nice surprise, next time I will bring my poodle with me so she can enjoy the treats served at Zenaida's .",

The food is delicious and fresh.   For starters we ordered avocado toast to shared. This is my first time having legit avocado toast and I am happy I had it here. It comes in 5 pieces and there is a small salad on top of the toast. The avocado toast was delicious! The toast, avocado, tomatoes and onion all perfectly blended together to make this one dish.  My sister order the waffle and turkey sausage. The waffle had whip creme and strawberries. It was a yummy and fluffy waffle. The whip cream and strawberries made it even better, I did not even need to use syrup. The turkey sausage cake in 4 pieces. They were a good size and was pretty thick.   I ordered the chicken breast sandwich. The sandwich was big and it came with fries. It was a pesto chicken sandwich with tomatoes. The chicken pieces were huge which I liked. I was only able to finish half of it.   They also gave us a complimentary dessert! It was 2 fresh baked cookies. It was soft and it put a smile on my face after the first bite. I love cookies and especially since it was fresh it made me even happier. I would pay for this cookie, so I can take it home to eat. It was a surprising and perfect dessert to end the meal. We will definitely be back.",

I ordered the \"Eggs Benedict\" which came with a side of their breakfast potatoes. The presentation was simple, English muffin topped with two thick cut pieces of bacon side by side, poached egg and then the hollandaise sauce nicely covering the whole thing. Such a great flavor on the hollandaise sauce and the bacon with egg created such a delicious melody that balanced each other very well.   My friends enjoyed different meals like the BLTA Sandwich, I was able to take a bite and it was such a fresh crisp feel, savory notes from the avocado and the sauce. The baguette was soft and did not jab your mouth like most do.   The other meal was a smoked salmon plate which was devoured completely, it was a nice plate bagel, salmon and all the other toppings neatly arranged along side for you to create your own delicious bite.   The service was excellent and the chef came out to check on us and apologize for the wait....which there was none! It was a pleasant pause for you to enjoy your conversation and get ready for the meal you are destined to enjoy. We were fortunate enough to enjoy some delicious sweet and soft cookies after our meal which perfectly ended the experience.   I would invite any of you on the fence to give this place a try, it is definitely a great place and I hope it continues to succeed and stick around for a long time so I can continue to try new things on their menu.  Thank you to the chef for an amazing breakfast with friends.",

Probably because, even for breakfast, they started us out with homemade potato chips and a garlic aioli. Then they finished us with the chef's mom's ambrosia.   I had the biscuits and gravy. This was a step up from the norm. It included a \"HOT\" link. That was a nice surprise.   My husband had the breakfast burger. He loved it.   We can't wait to go back and take our kids.",

We enjoyed a monstrous cinnamon roll, prepared with whipped cream, fresh berries, and caramel - YUM. Next was a monte cristo breakfast sandwich that had a spicy mayo and delicious chorizo. Our other entree was the tofu scramble, which was INCREDIBLE. Perfectly oily, seasoned, and an excellent blend of veggies, tofu, and rice. The chef sent out complimentary fire roasted pumpkin bread pudding to finish our meal, which was a perfect, thoughtful gesture - and very yummy! All the food was presented exceptionally well.   Service was excellent, with two servers helping us out, each with friendly recommendations and attentiveness.   The restaurant itself was very clean, colorful, and cute, with booths and tables, as well as a comfy couch/coffee table area and a couple of outside tables as well.   Thanks for a lovely experience!",

I got the quinoa burger with a side of salad and I was delited with the flavors this burger had. The salad had what tasted like a balsamic vinaigrette but it was sooooooo good I wanted to lick the bowl. Not only were our meals exquisite but the service is exceptional.

As I pulled into my parking spot I found myself staring at a sign that reads, \"Just good food\"! I thought to myself, \"Self....let's see just how good it is!\" So with a quick text we had a change of plans. As soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be good....I was greeted by a beautiful smile, seated right away and don't even get me started with the smells coming from the kitchen. The decor is adorable. The staff is super friendly, quick and efficient! The food? OMG! The food is amazing! I think my favorite part of the meal(besides my lunch date of course) was a quick hello from the Chef! So if you're looking for a quaint, delicious breakfast, brunch or lunch spot I highly recommend that you pop into Zenaida's Cafe, enjoy the fresh potato chips with garlic aioli and stay for the chocolate chip cookies at the end. I will definitely be back because I think I'm going to have to try everything on the menu at least once!",

We were surprised in the middle of our breakfast that the actual chef himself came to check how we were enjoying our food. Our server was nice too, he checked up on us plenty and refilled my coffee cup multiple times. We really enjoyed our expeeience and will be coming back!",

Generous serving and so good you eat the whole thing because you don't want to stop eating. The chicken has an amazing flavor and cooked perfectly. The waffle was nice and fluffy and soaked up the syrup beautifully. My friend got the eggs Benedict and she was super happy. We also got a n order of fried zucchini to share and we gobbled them right up. You can tell everything is cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients. Even though I am in a food coma, can't wait for my next visit. Also, the chef sent out some homemade chips with a garlic aioli good enough to bathe in and at the end of the meal warm chocolate chip cookies! You can tell everything is cooked with love and you can feel it while there. Food nirvana!",

I also like how their waffle dish comes with meat (sausage or bacon) included!  $9.69 (tax included) is a pretty sweet deal. Seems that the whipped cream is homemade. My only complaint is my waffle didn't come out crispy, even after checking with the waiter to make sure it's crispy and he put it as a request on my tab.   It was nice that the Chef stopped by my table and other tables to apologize for the delay and see if everything was alright. But, by then I ate my entire waffle.  Star for attentive service. Thumbs up. ;)   I'd recommend this place though and I'll give it another try, especially if the Chef keeps on giving his complimentary cookie! ;)",

Chef Sterling was incredibly humble as he took the time to stop by diners' tables, and later guided us through the gallery of his career achievements.  Food: Spectacular on every front! We ordered \"Fried Chicken & Waffle\", \"Zenaida's Breakfast\" and an omelette loaded with greens (a spinach omelette, if memory serves right?). The cuisine exuded character, and outstanding flavour (plus hearty portions). To top it off, the complimentary offerings, home-made potato chips with aioli (\"amuse-bouche\"), and  ambrosia salad (\"petits fours\"), were utterly delightful!  Verdict: Definitely tops our list of favourite brunch spots in the Southwest!",

Plus, the waiter refilled my drink without me even noticing..that showed how skilled he was at his job. The food was fantastic, but what really made the meal 5 stars was the experience. The chef came around and genuinely thanked every table for coming, forming a valuable connection with each guest. Everyone was also offered fresh-baked cookies drizzled in caramel as a complimentary dessert to finish off a pleasant meal. They were so warm and comforting and honestly melted in our mouths. Small gestures like this make all the difference.",

The chicken was very well seasoned and tasty. My only complaint is that I wish they gave a little more chicken for the price.   My buddies got bacon and eggs breakfast plates. The bacon was possibly the thickest bacon I've ever seen. I didn't get to taste it but they both noted that it was delicious.   The server was very nice and attentive.

Because I was a server at one point, I can really tell when a chef pours his heart and soul into their restaurant. This is one of those places. The food was so fresh and light without feeling like I was missing out on something.  I ordered the avocado toast, an egg and their breakfast potatoes. Everything was cooked very well and the flavors were on point. If you're looking for your next laid back breakfast spot, I highly recommend coming here. You will not be disappointed!",

You would never really know this place was here unless you stumbled upon this parking lot. We, however, found this lovely place on Yelp. Thank you, yelp. It truly is a remarkable place! Home-good feeling, wonderful aromas, a home-town setting.   Christmas music, happy employees, regular customers. A place you just want to be!  We started off with the cinnamon roll and boy was it out of this world! Sweet cream icing, whipped cream, some sort of drizzle, and berries on top with cinnamon. The smell is something memorable. SO delicious! I've never thought to eat a cinnamon roll with fruits but boy was it yummy! It was pretty big, yet we still ate it all. Our main courses arrived. Jaw dropping! The presentation was perfect and the food even better. Monte Cristo all the wayyy. The sandwiches cut perfectly in the middle. Eggs also very well cooked. Potatoes were how potatoes should be - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And everything was just so amazing.  Dessert of two warm chocolate chip cookies with whipped cream was thoughtfully made by chef, who also came by and made sure everything was going well. And it was just an all around amazing experience. Babe and I are excited to come back to try some other things on the menu.  Thank you for gracing us with your wonderful cooking, Chef!",

The decor is all types of mixed and super comfy/inviting.   Service: It was good. We spoke to 3 different people during our visit. First was the young lady who came to take our drink orders. She wasn't very friendly and seemed annoyed/ in a hurry. My mom asked a question about the menu and she was pretty short with her. Looked like she was in a big hurry but there were only 4 other parties at the restaurant with us. Our server was a nice guy! He was professional and took care of us, also had a little sense of humor which brightened up the mood! Last, the chef personally came out and asked how our food was which was a huge plus, he was so sweet and you can tell he genuinely cares about what he does and puts a lot of love into it.  Food: Everything was delicious! We started off with the avocado toast, the toast was crunchy on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside, the flavor, presentation and composition were incredibly amazing making this one of my favorite dishes! For my entree I ordered the Eggs Benedict with potatoes and everything was amazing! The tick cut bacon was my favorite part but it's definitely a classic dish I recommend. My mom ordered the tofu scramble and she loved it, it was a good size to share! For dessert we ordered the cinnamon roll and wow! It was soft, warm, and creamy with fresh fruit and a delicious icing on top. Last we're the freshly baked cookies. The ooey gooey delicious baked and delivered from heaven chocolate chip cookies. Y'all I'm not kidding these were the best, with a caramel drizzle and whipped cream. I'm telling you, you'll love it!   Extras: I heard they have a special menu Friday nights! You need to get on their email list but this is so awesome! Bathroom was also nice and clean with cute decorations.",

Everything was fresh and made to order.  We received complementary freshly baked cookies from the chef.  He even came out with a bag of animal crackers for my 2yo and asked how was our meal.

The accompanying salad was full of the healthy type of greens and served with a light but tasty vinaigrette dressing.  The one fault I had was that the server also bussed the tables, but hopefully as the excellent food builds a bigger customer base, the owner will hire a busboy for lunch.  Otherwise, I give this restaurant my highest recommendation!",

Ordered Eggs Benedict, Rib Hash daily special, and half an order of biscuits and gravy. You can taste the fresh ingredients. They really pay attention to how the food is made.  Restaurant located in a regular strip mall; interior is casual and inviting. Restaurant opened 7 months ago. Staff is super friendly.   Chef Sterling came out to greet all the customers and I told him how much we were enjoying our meal. At the end of the meal we were so stuffed but received as a gift from the chef a decadent dish of soft chocolate chip cookies topped with chantilly cream and strawberries. What a great way to end our meal!   Will definitely come back every time we are in vegas!",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here yesterday morning, 2/26, on the last day of a long weekend in Vegas.  We were looking for something off-strip, so we could avoid large crowds, ostentatious buffets and inflated pricing.  I selected Zenaida's on the strength of their Yelp rating, and we were absolutely not disappointed.  Right after we ordered, we were treated to a small plate of house-made chips and \"enchilada aioli\", compliments of the chef.  Not sure what was in the dip, but it was delicious!  We opted to start with the cinnamon bun, which was an absolute delight.  Warm, sweet and sticky, and piled high with a mound of whipped cream.  My wife enjoyed the Sterling breakfast: two eggs made to order, delicious breakfast potatoes and the thickest, juiciest slab of bacon I'd ever seen.  This was precisely the simple breakfast fare we were after, but done with such a high quality that it easily could have been featured in any of the high-end restaurants on The Strip.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which was also fantastic.  Eggs done perfectly (I prefer mine scrambled), the same thick-cut bacon, and a well-balanced Hollandaise sauce made for a delicious treat.  This, too, came with breakfast potatoes, which were crispy and MOLTEN LAVA HOT (seriously, be careful here).  After the meal, the chef sent out a plate of bunuelos-esque fried pita chips and whipped cream.  We practically needed to be rolled out of the restaurant.  Prices were extremely modest by Vegas standards, with the full meal for two running just over $30.  The staff at the cafe was friendly and genuinely eager to please.  Service before and during our meal was attentive, with ample refills to my coffee.  There was a slight slump in service when the time came to handle the check, but I am more than willing to let that slide in the face of the excellent experience we had otherwise.  We don't travel to Las Vegas frequently, but I am sure we'll be back here the next time we come around.  In the meantime, please do yourselves a favor and check this place out!",

Hoping to make these Jazz nights permanent, I'll throw my educated, experienced 2 cents in on the $40 gourmet dinner with renowned Jazz pianist!      However arriving there.. then scrutinizing the larger print, it shocked us that all but 2 (?) entrees were really quite $$ higher. The hostess was most cordial. As seemed an intimate venue, we hoped to socialize and make new friends. However we two senior sweeties were cloistered ringside to a celebrated jazz guest.  Doesn't he deserve at least a 4 or 6 top frontstage?  So like a couple on a prom date we romantically sat alone by stage. We reckoned part of the high price was the featured artist. Sadly, other than us starting the applause, his art was barely acknowledged.    Otherwise everyone was having a wonderful time!    I took my gaze from pianist and saw two tiny sensually sauced toasts   at my dinner partners elbow. \"hmmm\" I sniffed, \"when is he bringing mine?\"  \"Uh, think this is for both of us!\" Returning to my table later, I saw a lovely little 10 leaf Caesar salad. Well, isn't that nice they split our salad? \"No\" Deana said, \"That IS your salad\"  She then swallowed one fragrant morsel of something, \"and that was MY lobster horderve \"  Now, I like being thin and having a small stomach, however these starters were the sparsest starters I've ever ended up with.   Happy High school girlfriends siping our chilled byob champagne, giggling,  grooving to music and still starving to death until with chagrined hunger we plead for another tiny toast....        Then... Va Va Voom! Our entrees were forklifted in. A plentiful portion of gorgeous Chicken Marcella was plopped down in front of Deana. Two servers lifted my Fettuccine platter down to me.  The first sumptuous mouthfuls brought a swoon to my stomach, a smile on my smacker!  A sparky, spicy bacony topping kicked in, contrasting textures and creamy flavors swirling into some of the best fettucini I have ever had!    However...it was beyond rich, so killer, that after several voluptuous mouthfuls, my brow began to sweat, I felt faint. I was left comatose, staring at this magnificent throbbing mound of warm, melted, dripping cheese and hot oozing butter..  Way too much, way too late.  No big O!    Realizing they had a next seating we settled our bill. Gifted Chef Sterling graciously stopped by our table. Deana did her happy Marcella dance to the car while I hauled my 2 lbs of Fettuccine Carbonara behind me.   It was a perfect, imperfect evening.   We hope to attend again and bring friends next time!",

When I told the waiter I didn't eat pork or beef he suggested I substitute the ham on the eggs benedict for avocado and it was amazing!   They also brought us free chips with a delicious homemade dipping sauce. At the end of our meal the cook came out and thanked us for coming in, which was super nice. They also gave us two free fresh baked cookies for dessert. The food was delicious and the staff were amazing. Will definitely make this a go to spot when I'm on that side of town.",

I ordered the garlic rosemary fries, which were delicious, and a very large serving.

No complaints here. The owner/chef Sterling, came over to our table and spoke with us. A very friendly man who seems to love his job. The tall toke said he knew what he was doing. Sterling's daughter Carmen, was hostess and server. Not only cute as a button but a sweet bubbly personality.. and very efficient.

    "text": "Read the reviews and decided to try this past Sunday for breakfast.   With all the great reviews, I expected it to be really busy and was dreading a long wait.   We arrived and it wasn't busy. Maybe 2 or 3 other tables with people.  Great for us!   Staff was super friendly and helpful.  My 5 yr old wanted the avocado toast.  Now everyone seems to do avocado toast, but whatever, fine.  We'll get it.   It arrived and I was ever so surprised.   Slices of grilled/lightly toasted baguette topped with smashed avocado, a grape or cherry tomato on top, pickled onion and a balsamic glaze drizzled.  It was one of the best avocado toasts I've had.   We got the monte Cristo.  My husband raves about it.  It was just too meaty for me.   Also, we got the corned beef hash.  Nothing to write home about.  Almost the texture of canned corned beef.  Not a fan. I like a chunky corned beef hash, but that's my own personal preference.   At the end of the meal, we received a plate of chocolate chip cookies, fresh from the oven.  One problem, they were drizzled with some type of unnecessary glaze.  Way too sweet for us.    Gave this 5 stars because: 1) nice and quiet, almost relaxing, unlike most of the other morning breakfast spots 2) the avocado toast! 3) The service was great 4) everything besides the hash was awesome  Will definitely be back!",

She was very nice and welcoming. As we were being seated the chef said hello as well, which mind you doesn't really happen. They have their regular menu + a today's special menu. We ordered the tri tip on a baguette, nacho style fries, quinoa vegan burger, and cookies and cream for dessert. The tri tip sandwich and quinoa burger was amazing. Even the salad you can tell all the veggies and ingredients were carefully picked out. There were no bruises on any of the greens, I was so surprised! The chef came up to us and made sure we were enjoying the food.   Hands down a place you should check out and see for yourself how awesome this place is.",

    "text": "**9/1/18 updated review**  Sadly another high rated place of mine that's fallen from its ranks.  We came here for late breakfast on Saturday and it was pretty busy. Didn't realize busy would mean such a fail every step of the way.  We were seated fairly quickly but the waiter was obviously short/stressed. Service was not warm at all.  There were a few other tables where patrons looked obviously miffed with food/time issues.  The vibe was not enjoyable overall.  They forgot my husband's toast with his meal.  Also didn't tell us that each cup of coffee was a new charge/no refills.  My quinoa burger was good, but small, and not worth $12.  Bill came to $30 for two mediocre meals w poor service and lots of surrounding chaos.  Not sure if I'll be back...being able to operate efficiently when you're busy is a standard. It clearly wasn't happening on any level.  I do work hard for my money and dining out needs to be pleasurable and worth it. With that said, I'm not sure I'll be back here again. I may give it one more try to see how it goes for 3 out of 3.   Original review ***  Wow! I am beyond impressed with this place.  Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, and I was sooo hungry. I was seated quickly & asked for a recommendation as it was my first time. Decided on the tofu scramble w nori, rice, & slaw. It was SO good, and made in a different way than the standard tofu scramble every other vegan friendly place makes. The flavors were amazing!  The chef also brought out a vegan rice pudding for me that was out of this world. He was very friendly, and I could tell he truly cares about his business and customers.  I had a great experience here and will definitely return.",

If there's enough chicken, I would be able to take the leftover home. Since it's just vegetables, I did not bother. I have tried Cobb salad at other restaurants and the chicken portion was much bigger in the Cobb salad. As far as the coffee, I am afraid to say it's the worst. My instant coffee at home is even way better.  Let's see some positive: they gave you some homemade potato chips while waiting for your food. They were really good, the best I have ever had. At the end, they gave you homemade fresh chocolate chips cookies. They were still soft and warm, felt like they just came out of the oven, good too but I couldn't finish the whole cookie since I was on a diet.",

The menu may not look extensive but everything on there is made of pure quality. I tried getting a picture of the avocado toast but my family wolfed it down in less than ten seconds straight. The glaze spouses perfectly. We also had the Eggs Benedict and the Smoked Salmon plate. The eggs were absolutely not overpowering or felt overtly spiced, as so many other places do. In addition, the potatoes  had a light but fun crisp to them, not oily at all. The smoked salmon plate comes with a lightly toasted bagel, and it reminds me more of a zen garden than a bagel plate; I'm pretty sure it got me one step closer to enlightenment. And the freshly made chocolate chips cookies, by God, they melt in your mouth. Overall, a lovely hidden gem in Vegas, will be back if possible.",

They also bring out complementary house fries as an appetizer with an AMAZING garlic aioli sauce that I will be dreaming about for a while! And to top it off they concluded the meal with complementary cookies!!!!   On top of that the chef walked around to all the tables and personally thanked everyone.   Can't wait to come again!",

    "text": "Zenaida's is my favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas. The staff is always friendly and courteous.  We came in for brunch on July 1st, and were seated right away. The restaurant is a little warm, but it was not unbearable.   I ordered the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered the Colin's Breakfast Burger.   My boyfriend stayed that the breakfast sandwich was decent, but there are better things on the menu that he would try before ordering the breakfast burger again. The chicken and waffles were okay. I think that the chicken and waffles I had in the past have always been a more meaty part of the chicken. The flavor and breading was good, I just think the chicken was a little too thin for my taste. It isn't a dish I would order again, but it doesn't deter me away from visiting Zenaida's again. I much prefer the biscuits and gravy that I had ordered on a previous visit.  The waiter also brought by a complementary basket of potato chips. They were so good!! Especially the aioli dipping sauce! I would put it on everything if I could! And of course at the end of the meal you always get the complimentary cookies that taste like they just came out of the oven.  The best part of Zenaida's is the customer service. The chef always comes to check in on guests to make sure that we are satisfied. We have this establishment bookmarked as a breakfast favorite! Thank you Zenaida's for the good food and wonderful customer service!",

They still serve complimentary homemade chips before the meal and a chocolate chip cookie at the end. The coffee was strong and hot. The service was timely and attentive without being intrusive. The chef took the time to ask whether I enjoyed his dishes. I wish this business every success and hope that they are earning enough. The portion sizes seem large for the price.",

We stumbled upon this place after an eye appointment and I'm glad my eye doctor is close by so it'll be a little treat to myself every time I get my eyes picked and prodded. I had the chicken and waffles while my husband built his own omelet. The food was delicious! After we had our meal they even gave us complimentary apple cobbler.

That's not a knock on Zenaida's at all, I just typically like my breakfast pretty straight up: breakfast meet, eggs, potatoes, toast, and coffee. I was very much pleasantly surprised! The bacon is to die for and their breakfast potatoes are more than your average fair. The complimentary cookies at the end did not hurt at all :D",

Greens for the avocado toast were delicious and seasoned differently than salad for other dishes. Delighted to see a fresh ripe fig on my plate. Also offers vegetarian dishes and I'll skip the quinoa burger and try the tofu dish next time. Complimentary cookies, but we would have highly rated Chef Sterling and this establishment anyway. . Agree w good customer service- our service was great.   We encountered this unassuming restaurant and are glad we did. Now it is your turn.",

The pancakes were out of this world and even their coffee (decaf) was full of flavor and not watered down like most places. Before we left, we were offered a dessert. It was the best banana bread pudding I have EVER had!! We will definitely come back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I love getting brunch. It's the one thing in life worth getting up early for.  Zenaida's was a great pick because they have dishes for meat eaters and some vegetarian choices, as well. I'm talking well thought out items, not the usual afterthought dishes that you get from most establishments.   I was torn between the scrambled tofu dish with rice and the breaded/fried eggplant lettuce cups. I ended up ordering a dish off the weekly specials list, the Vegan Stack. Grilled onions and shredded potatoes were layered with two jerk-rubbed, grilled tofu steaks. Chopped tomatoes and red onion topped the stack for a good mix of raw and cooked veggies. Everything was well seasoned and full of flavor. The jerk spice made that dish.   During our meal, the chef stepped out to greet and thank us for joining them for breakfast. Along with the service from our sweet server, I'd say they provided us with an excellent overall dining experience.   After our meal, we were presented with two warm chocolate chip cookies, adorned with whipped cream and caramel drizzle, compliments of the chef. I cannot think of a sweeter gesture than this. The cookies were just the way I like them, soft and chewy; simple and comforting, all at once. The care and attention we received felt like we were dining at a family member's home. This little gem is the perfect reason to support local, independent businesses.",

We were given complimentary homemade potato chips with aioli (really aioli, not just commercial mayonnaise mixed with stuff) upon arrival/after ordering and they were pretty good. We ordered shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, and chicken and waffles. The grits were sooo cheesy (just the way we like 'em) and the gravy was delicious and made the dish rich. Biscuits were fluffy and although the gravy had a different taste than what we were accustomed to (a little sweet with some seasoning I didn't recognize), the spicy sausage really made the dish come together and balanced out the sweetness of the gravy. The waffle was fluffy and moist, not hard and dry like a lot of other places! The chicken was lightly battered and had great flavor, too. Also loved the caramel sauce on top of the chicken and waffles.  After our meals were finished, they brought out complementary fresh baked cookies-- honestly as a pregnant woman this sealed the deal for me to return! They were still warm from the oven, soft, and gooey.   Thank you, we will be back!!!!",

Ordered a hamburger and was asked , \"How pink do you want it?\"  It was prepared perfectly with crispy fries, a thick sliced pickle, and tomato. I will be back to sample many more yummy sounding dishes.  I mentioned to the owner/chef that next time I would try the avocado toast - to my surprise, Chef Sterling prepared an order for me!",

When you first arrive you are greeted immediately...we had a party of 7 i was surprised they got us seated within 5 min. Once we got to our table they took our drink orders... Shortly thereafter they took our food orders ,..while we waited for our food to arrive they brought us free homemade potato chips with a homemade aioli sauce... The sauce was so good my 2 year old grandson tore it up and he can be a picky eater. They also gave us a complimentary avocado toast because another party ordered it inadvertently. It was delicious.. Avocado was fresh..ripe cherry tomatoes ..only wish we had a little more of that balsamic vinegar they splashed on top... My shrimp and grits arrived. Omgoodness it was scrumptious.. And there was plenty of grits i had enough to bring home for dinner. My party also ordered the clam chowder if you like meaty hearty clams this is definitely the meal to get... Everyone in our party was pleasantly happy with their order. As a grand finale they served each of us a pumpkin bread pudding with a side of whipped topping... It was definitely a delightful ending to our meal. My boyfriend doesnt like pumpkin and even he ate the entire dessert. The chef personally approached us to thank us for coming. Customer service was top notch. I gave this place 5 stars ...the only thing i think they could work on is making sure all the food comes to the table at the same time. My daughter waited about 10 mins after we were served for her chicken wings to arrive.other than that they are top notch.. My family and i will definitely be coming back!!",

This place really gets it and what I mean by that is the welcoming atmosphere, the smooth playing jazz, the at home feel to the restaurant and great food and a wonderful family running this place.  After your your 2nd visit you will feel like you have known the Chef since childhood. Very personable, available, outgoing and just an all around great guy and incredible Chef. When I say incredible don't let that be an understatement as you will see things on his menu and try it and more than likely it will be the best version you ever tried. He is passionate about his craft like a Michael Jordan and has a class and charisma of a Frank Sinatra. He  is a savant in his profession and has some of the best food you will ever eat anywhere on earth. Trust me I have been everywhere. On top of all that he will feed you like an old Italian Grandma would whether you order it or not it will be coming your way he is very giving and even when your stuffed you'd be crazy not to indulge in what he sends out to you. This is a wonderful place and if you go there you will become a regular. I can't say enough about this place other than they have great food and this Family really gets it which is a rarity in the times we live in.  You won't find a better meal in Vegas for the cost's as he is serving food that places on the strip would charge you $40 or $50 a plate for and his is better. Come check it out i'm sure you'll agree this is the best little gem in Vegas.",

You can see into the kitchen and even listen to the chef give instructions.  That was kinda cool.   He was instructing the line on the quality he expected!  Nice upbeat instrumental music playing.   We got a warm greeting and seated immediately.  Just about everything on the menu looked awesome.  I decided on pancakes and my husband had biscuits and gravy.   But first one of the servers brought out homemade potato chips with a red pepper aioli. That was really yummy!!  The pancakes were really yummy and hallelujah somebody that knows how to cook pancakes!  I am so tired of getting half cooked pancakes!  My husband liked his biscuits and gravy.   The gravy wasn't what he expected since is was a brown gravy instead of light.   But it was really tasty. Oh I forgot to mention SUPER fast service!  Then at the end, our server brought us two little bites of pumpkin bread pudding complements of the chef.  It was really yummy as well. I just love little touches like that.  Really makes you feel like they appreciate their customers. Well done!  And as we leave the chef says thanks, goodbye and Happy New Year through the pass window!",

Anyways, we get to the restaurant and she orders the Tofu Scramble and I order the Eggs Benedict. The Eggs Benedict will look like your average Eggs Benedict but boy were they different! I don't know what type of sauce they used on the eggs but man, it was like crack. One bite and I was hooked! The eggs were made perfectly and the bacon on the Eggs Benedict was cooked just right! My date's tofu scramble wasn't half bad either. It was good but we both came to the conclusion that we are both carnivores because meat was the only thing that could have made that dish better! But as stated, it was still good. All in all I had a very well wonderful time eating here. There was good food, good atmosphere and of course, great company! 5 stars all the way!",

They were really good, felt like the aioli was missing something but I didn't need it anyway. We both ordered omelettes-they were fluffy and hot. I have a comment regarding this though: the menu says you can have 3 items in your omelette but it has no list of choices.  So I ordered the standard ham and cheese. The chef forgot my ham. So I had eggs and cheese. It was ok. I did point it out and they sent out some warm cookies for us.  Overall it was good, I enjoyed the jazz music playing. It was comfortable and the people were nice. Don't know that this is my go to breakfast place though. Solid 3 stars.",

Chef comes out to check in everyone. Great menu with superb variety sure to please anyone. We went on a Sunday morning around 930am and there was no wait. The food - delicious! I had the egg benedict, it was very tasty with very thick bacon. I couldn't eat all the bacon. Hubby and son had the breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll. They said the burrito was very good and could see why this place gets 5 stars. The cinnamon roll is very sweeet with frosting, whipped cream and strawberries on top. If I'm in Vegas again, I would come back...otherwise, Zenaida's, feel free to come to California!",

After reading all of the great Yelp reviews, I decided to give Zenaida's a shot.  I ordered Tremaine's Biscuits & Gravy. I have found a great love for freshly baked buttery biscuits in flavorful country gravy in recent months. And unfortunately, I found today's dish to be lacking in flavor. The biscuits were dry and the country gravy tasted like it was missing something. I added a little salt in hopes that it would bring the flavors to life; however, that did not work out as I was hoping. The dish came with four sausages - which were very flavorful and easily my favorite part of the dish. In my opinion, it was short of average and not worth the $10 price tag.  I had very high hopes for Zenaida's after reading all the amazing Yelp reviews and I ended up a little disappointed. I would definitely be willing to give Zenaida's Cafe a second chance - but maybe next time a different dish...",

The sandwich had thick, tasty bacon. I traded half my sandwich for some salad which was delish. The BEST part was after we finished our waiter brought us 2 chocolate chip cookies compliments of the chef...THEE BEST EVERRR!

If it was busy I can understand it'll take a bit longer but not a lot of patrons during this time. I've ordered a side of bacon and it was burned. My wife ordered fried chicken and the chicken was bland, no taste. Strawberry served on my plate wasn't fresh or edible. What made everything worst was the burned tasting coffee, seem it was sitting in the burner for a long time. With that said, won't recommend this resto.",

The food here is good and the service was excellent. The servers were very attentive and the Chef even gave us a complimentary dessert. It was a pumpkin bread dessert that we ate up real fast. We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, thick cut bacon, and the Monte Cristo  Shrimp and Grits: This dish was good. The grits weren't overcooked or over seasoned and had a lot of cheese in them. There was also a good amount of shrimp on the plate and came with over easy eggs.  This dish had way too much sauce on the plate, which kind of took over the buttery and cheesy flavor of the grits. Less sauce and this would be almost perfect.   Monte Cristo: This was a really good breakfast sandwich. The eggs were nice and runny and the bread was not soggy. The potatoes were nice and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Bacon: I wish I would've ordered more of this. Nothing better than extra thick cut bacon.",

Update: still lovin' this place!!! Kind of hard to see--in same mall as BoA and Taco y Taco (another must!) on the north side of the mall. Get there by 1:30 as they sometimes do their last seating then. Well worth going a few minutes out of your way. Generous portions and they usually give you free chips and aioli before meal and cookies after.",

Another quote from my sis-in-law, \"New bucket list item - eat every item on this menu before I die.\" The service was amazing, as the chef came to our table and noticed our baby was eating some of our food, and asked if he could have a pancake. Of course we had to try a piece of the pancake and it's best I've ever had. We liked it so much we're going back tomorrow with the rest of our family. Every time I come to Vegas I'm going to come here, and everyone else should as well. The hype is real!!!",

The salmon plate was heaped with generous portions of salmon, chopped egg, capers, green and red onions, and about a pound of cream cheese - but the surprise hit was the smear of mustard to go with it all. A True classic expertly perfected.  The corned beef had a more delicate flavor than I'm used to in this over-salted world, and was just the perfect amount of flavor to go with the shredded hash browns and the scallion hollandaise sauce with 2 over-easy eggs. The dish was served piping hot, and I had a hard time not finishing the half I promised to share with my girlfriend.   Two cookies, compliments of the chef (who came out to check on us and who, by the way, opened the Wynn as Executive Chef!) was the perfect way to end this delightful meal. We will be back, and will be recommending this place to everyone we know!",

I would have never found it if it wasn't out of curiosity on why this little cafe, in a neighborhood I'm normally not in, had almost 105 star reviews. Also, with a name like Zenaida's, I would have assumed it was another Mexican style restaurant in Las Vegas. But what it is, is a fabulous fusion of bistro meets new American meets comfort-food.   The staff is so friendly and welcoming. You really do feel like you're part of a cool family that knows how to cook really well. The atmosphere is kind of kitschy and funky. And the little extras that they give you, like the homemade potato chips with aioli at the beginning to the meal and the cookies with cream at the end, really makes it special.   It's really kid friendly as well. My girlfriend brings her baby and the staff always googles over her and brings her little animal crackers or fruit to enjoy. We never asked for it they are just Johnny-on-the-spot and appears like magic. I highly recommend you check it out  for brunch . Their breakfast and brunch menu is definitely my favorite.",

Hats off to the Chef!!",

My mom's breakfast burrito had flavor and spicy homemade salsa to top it off! You gotta try their zuchinni fries and garlic fries, even comes with fancy sauce to dip it in!

The Benedict and breakfast burrito got great reviews from my friends, and my standard eggs and potatoes just what I wanted.

    "text": "Zenaida where have you been all of my life?? Well, all of my 13 yrs & 5 mos in LV.  It seems that I'm on a never-ending quest to find that quaint little local breakfast/brunch place that is simultaneously no frills and spectacular. Also, said place must not be overrun. A hidden gem, if you will.  There are a million breakfast and brunch options in this town and most of them are doing a fine job. Few are going above and beyond. Zenaida's is one of the few.  I don't go out for breakfast all that often, despite most of my bookmarks being for breakfast places. I love breakfast. I'm just not too keen on the that side of noon. So, when I am going out to breakfast it becomes a big decision as to where to go. I had had Zenaida's bookmarked for a while, and only put it on my to try list because it was close by with 5 stars on Yelp.   When we arrived we received a warm greeting. We were instructed to sit anywhere we liked. Within a few minutes the server took our drink order and while she was gone to get them, a 2nd server stopped to make sure she had been over and drinks were on the way. It made me feel like they had a lot of team mentality to ensure the customer was always taken care of.  We weren't super hungry so we decided to share a cinnamon roll & the chicken in waffles. After we ordered they brought is house made chips with a bloody Mary aoli. Honestly, I can't think of any other breakfast places with give you something like this at breakfast. Plus, it was really delicious. I don't even like aoli, but I was all over this. The chips we're fantastic.   My husband is a bit of a cinnamon roll connesieur, and this one did not disappoint! Not only was this cinnamon roll fresh and delicious, but it had a beautiful presentation that I just wasn't expecting from a little whole in the wall breakfast place. Every time I go to Zenaida's, this will be a must. Fresh baked & served warm.  The chicken & waffles, which aren't normally my thing, we're also great. I like my chicken crispy and this was crispy with a hint of sweetness. The waffle tasted great, but I would have preferred that to be crispy as well, and it was more on the cakey side.  As a special treat, we were given warm gooey chocolate chip cookies from the chef at no charge. A completely unexpected, but extremely appreciated surprise. They were amazing.  While we ate, I was listening to the next table over talking about Zenaida's food. It appeared to be a family of 1/2 locals and 1/2 visiting from parts unknown. The locals were raving about the food and said their Mac n Cheese \"the most decadent thing you'll ever eat\".  I don't know why I dragged my feet checking this place out, but I've been fantasizing about that cinnamon roll, and I can't wait to go back.  Zenaida's is clean, the food is great, and the service is outstanding.",

The food here is very good but the service is always slow and less than desirable.  Today reached an all time low in customer service and I have decided to never eat here again.  We came here and brought my mother-in-law and rest of our family (party of 5) who was in town and my mother-in-law who is 80+ years and has trouble standing and walking. We walked in and there were 3 tables occupied, a few tables dirty and a few tables set and ready to go. The older thin gentleman with the spiked gray hair came up to the counter and told us there would be a 10 minute wait to be seated because he needed time to get caught up. I was a bit taken a back by his statement as the customer had to wait because he needed to get \"caught up from the rush\". I had to get a chair for my mother-in-law to sit while we waited to be seated in the virtually empty restaurant. After waiting he ended up sitting us a table that was already setup and ready to go when we walked in. I watched him whisper something to the server who took care of our table and I knew it was about us because she turned around to look directly at us. Needless to say the service was even worse than normal from her as well. From now on I will take my business and my family to a place that values the customers.",

Chicken and waffles were average, the waffles tasted a bit doughy but the chicken breast( chicken fingers) were seasoned well.  I specifically asked if they were chicken fingers and was told no it was chicken breast. I asked for a side of jalapeno bacon however I couldn't get it because it only goes with the shrimp and grits. They did send out a side of the regular slab bacon complimentary(?) while I appreciate the gesture I would have gladly paid for the jalapeno bacon.  The jazz music was great, the chef came out and talk to every table......except ours  I'm a foodie and would have loved to chat ( the restaurant was not busy).  We travel  a lot and for me when I go to an independent restaurant the little things bring me back. This spot was just not for me.",

We found Zenaida's on Yelp and 9 of us went there to try it out. I won't go in to all the dishes, because everyone ordered something different, but suffice it to say that they were all great and plentiful. We liked it so much we went back the next day again and brought another 7 classmates with us for a total of 16 of us. Everyone enjoyed their food. The chef came out and talked to us afterwards bringing hot, homemade chocolate chip cookies with amazing whipped cream of all of us on the house. Their special menu those two days was amazing with a variety of Eggs Benedict and omelets. The biscuit and gravy with sausage would have fed several. All of us would go back if given the chance to be back in that area.",

She passed by and hubby told her we were ready. She walked to another table that was seated after us and took their order. Ok waited long enough, we walked out. Have to admit that is was gutsy on the owners part to chase us down at our car and beg us to give them another try. We did. Again food was awesome, spot on. We had the avocado toast, which was great. I had eggs benedict, very yummy. Hubby had the corned beef, homemade. The minus star is for the growing pains. I hate bad food, but bad service is no fun either. The owners were great. Someone else was not happy and went out yelling. The owner said they can't keep up with the growth and will be hiring more people. We drove from the strip and it was worth it. We will be back.",

The staff always makes you feel welcome and the chef has come out to say Hi every time we've been there. The fact that we've been given a free warm cookie dessert at every visit doesn't hurt either. The only complaint I have is that I wish there were a few more healthier and lighter options. Sometimes we choose to eat other places because we're just not in the mood for such a heavy meal. But that's about me, not them. Everything they do they do perfectly.",

This nicely decorated restaurant has the opportunity to become one of those neighborhood \"go to\" places for breakfast and lunch.  They offered an excellent selection of items that are priced well for the quality and quantity of food.  I selected an omelette and was able to choose the ingredients to customize it to my taste.  I was presented with perfectly prepared breakfast including excellent potatoes, toast and a side of fruit.  The quality of the ingredients was top notch including an a very tasty thick piece of applewood bacon adorning the top. Nice touch and very flavorful.  Please do yourself and the neighborhood a favor and try this restaurant. I would love to see them to grow and expand to dinner.",

Our server was very nice, even stopping to let us know their specials and how they have dinners on Friday nights. The chef and owner, Sterling, came out to greet us and chat about his cooking style and the restaurant. He's a really awesome guy and his food taste amazing. We got the avocado toast, tofu scramble, waffles, breakfast potatoes, and scrambled eggs. Chef Sterling also gave us free Apple cobbler, which my bf and I couldn't stop eating.

I always get the avocado toast to start, which is just wonderful. It comes on crostinis with cherry tomatoes, pickled red onion (which complements the dish really well), balsamic glaze, olive oil, and topped with a salad. I usually get the eggs Benedict which is just perfect. Its not with traditional Canadian bacon. Its even better! It comes with thick cut slab bacon and the hollandaise sauce is perfect! I tried the biscuits and gravy. It was fantastic and very hearty! Chef Sterling and staff are AMAZING! They make you feel so welcome here. I can't say enough how much I love this place! Its a must try. You wont be disappointed!",

The Eggs Benedict were superb, the biscuits and gravy were amazing, all with nice seasoning and the right amount of spice and good old comfort food. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the size of your head. The chips and aoli and cookies and cream were wonderful delights.   This gem will be on must visit list when coming through vegas.",

The avo toast is a must-order, combining garlic bread and the trendy healthy breakfast dish to excellent results, with a small salad that makes the $8 \"appetizer\" easily suitable as a meal. The Cobb salad is traditionally prepared, adding some oomph with a cilantro ranch.  Location has a variety of seating options, and plenty of attentive staff. Food came out a bit slowly, so maybe call ahead if you are coming in on a short lunch break. Portions are large and all of the produce was super-fresh, which is hard to find on this side of town for anything but Mexican food. Looking forward to coming back to try their quinoa burger!",

You can tell they aim to personalize your experience. They even gave us free food: Housemade potato chips served with a delicious sauce and for dessert chocolate chip cookies which were to die for! We also shared a cinnamon roll which was served with a delicious whipped cream and berries. Excellent food. Excellent service. All around a great dining experience!",

People of Vegas, don't look any further!!  First time here and we will now be regulars.   Perfect food, excellent service, and fairly priced with large portions!!   I ordered biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were fluffy and the sausage links were sooo good. The gravy was perfect. The best I've ever had I can't believed I finished the whole plate!!  Don't be hesitant if you think it's too much for you to eat, it's savory and filling but not too heavy.  We also ordered the fried chicken and waffles. My husband said it tasted like Disneyland, even tho he's never been, I took a bite and right away felt like I just walked through Heaven.  Culinary at its finest. Everything came out perfect. The chef is the owner and he was so nice.  Eat where the employees and owner take pride in their food and business like these guys!",

Aside from being expertly seasoned, the serving size was very generous as well. To our surprised, we were also served some homemade kettle chips. I've never met a potato I didn't like, and these chips were no exception. As for my meal, I ordered the shrimp and avocado eggs Benedict. It was inarguably one of the best breakfasts I've had in months. I strongly believe that the hollandaise sauce is the best part of a Benedict, and theirs was among the best I've ever had! Right when we thought we physically could not eat anymore, our server brought us out some cookies complements of the chef. Par with the course, they were fantastic. The chef actually came out to greet some customers, which was certainly a nice touch. Overall, I cannot rave about Zenaida's enough!",

From the warm greeting, to the complimentary homemade chips & aioli, to the delicious Mother's Day brunch my family and I had, I would highly recommend this place!!!  The chef and staff go out of their way to make this a memorable experience!  From avocado toast, to eggs Benedict, to Asian chicken salad and a pork chop Stack, I am sure everything on the menu is just as delicious as what we had!  My son had the brunch special with lobster bisque, (with Huge chunks of lobster) smoked salmon Benedict and a yummy dessert!  Excellent!  Then to complete the meal, the chef sent out a some warm, gooey, homemade chocolate chip cookies, drizzled in Caramel sauce, also complementary!  Thank you to Zenaida's for making it a fabulous Mother's Day!  We will definitely go back!!!",

Crunchy garlic toast with avocado and heirloom tomatoes with a sliver of red onion. WOW, my taste buds have been forever altered. My wife had the chicken and  waffles. Seriously, c'mon, are you guys this good at everything? I didn't try the chicken, but the waffles were amazing! Truly worth it just for the waffles alone. But don't forget the Avocado Toast. I had the Mac and Cheese with gator style sausage. I was disappointed, that there wasn't more! I was stuffed about 2/3 the way through it but I just couldn't stop eating that creamy, slightly spicy, bowl of nirvana! I haven't even told you about the cookies the chef sent out when we were done! Real whipped cream, soft, gooey cookies. Still warm! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here daily, hands down the best place to go and just minutes from the strip! The guys in the kitchen are Gastric Gods! I will be back, even if I have to walk from Colorado!",

I loved the mom and pop feel of the restaurant. The food presentation keeps up with the modern trend and the taste is even more amazing. We ordered the smoked salmon with Bagel, loved the fixings that came with it. Also ordered a breakfast sandwich with Portuguese sausage (Monte Cristo Sandwich) and that was a good choice! It was very filling. Their burgers are huge and tasty. Their waffles with fresh strawberries also did not disappoint, big portion as well. Love love that they serve homemade chips to start with and they end our meals with super gooey chocolate chip cookies with a side of whipped cream, both complimentary! Staff are super friendly, that's always a bonus. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends.",

Homemade potato chips were served compliments of the chef and to finish off the meal we were also served warm chocolate chip cookies drizzled with a caramel sauce and powdered sugar. Yum!

The service was also up to speed and the chef came over to make certain everything was okay! Will definitely be back and will bring out of town guests. I would love to see what the chef could do for dinner but understand he needs a break! Thank you for an amazing Sunday morning!",

Not \"let's-play-a-Michael-Jackson-song-and-add-a-saxophone-to-it\" smooth jazz, no this is straight ahead jazz. I enjoy that on a lazy Sunday.  We received an order of fresh potato chips and sauce. Compliments of the chef.  My wife had the biscuits and gravy. The hot links were just spicy enough. Interesting that they use a brown gravy instead of the usual.  I ordered the eggs Benedict. After I ordered, the staff informed me that they had run out of the slab bacon, so I had to settle for the regular ham. It was okay. The hollandaise had a bit more lemon than I usually like but it was not off-putting. I was a little upset. If I have my taste buds ready for something, I do not appreciate substitutions well. I'm whiney? Sure! Do I pay for my food? Yes! So, I guess I can act like a disappointed middle schooler if I want. Usually, after careful thought and reflection, I can appreciate what I had, but in this case, I really was intrigued by this \"slab bacon\" and was quite disappointed by getting something less. I get it. It's popular. I can understand limit of product. I thought we were there early enough. Maybe because it was the day after the time change...who knows. It certainly did not take away from the quality of the meal nor the staff. Both were impeccable.  After our meal, the chef sent out moist chocolate chip cookies with yummy cream sauce. Very good.  So, the verdict was, we liked it well enough to try it again and I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. I'm sure you will dig it.",

Great place to come for breakfast/lunch, really cute and clean setup, and mellow jazz playing in the background ... Not only will we be coming back -- we intend on making this our honorary \"spot.\" Yay   We ordered:  Garlic parmesan fries: which, c'mon. Garlic freakin' fries. Bomb, am-i-rite?!  Eggs Benedict: this is the one item I have to try anywhere I go and base a good majority of my judgement on. And YASSS. My eggs were poached perfectly (which may I say is not thaaat easy to do, speaking from my own experience, anyway) the hollandaise was light and bright and nicely cut through the mmm mmm major savoryness from the SLAB bacon. SO impressed.  But the avocado toaaaasssttt you guys: bro. I'm not a big avocado person (weird, I know.) And I'm not a big avocado toast person. Yeea. Not my first choice. But BROO.  Why doesn't ALL avocado toast taste like this? Avocado mash is served on top of garlic crostinis with the most perfect texture and thickness and garlickyness, duh, (bread is life) with tomatoes and balsamic glaze and a little arugula salad on the side. I chose to have this as my last good bite to seal the deal to an epic meal. #noregrets  We also got to try a little side of sweet potato chips which was so thin and fun to eat -- they're what's usually served with items on their vegan menu. And judging by the awesomeness of flavors we had, I'm actually anxious to try said vegan menu   Chef Sterling also sent out a couple warm, melt-in-your-mouth (and kind of in your hands too) gooey chocolate chip cookies that were SO good. Emphasis on SO. And emphasis on good, while we're at it.   Chef Sterling actually made the time to come and check up on us and every table for that matter and we got to chat for a little bit. Now, my boyfriend and I have worked for restaurants for a long time so we know what qualities to look for and, wow, SO MUCH respect for Chef Sterling -- what he's doing with his food, the background he comes from, how he interacts with his guests -- all very respectable and impressive and it's just great form of a real chef.   Jaime was great too handling the whole place, relaying orders straight to chef, never missing a beat.   So. Just to recap. Throughly enjoyed. Will be back. Wonderful flavors. Lots of options. Great staff. AWESOME chef. Super impressed. Just do it, guys. Trust.",

    "text": "Vegas is home to many great places to eat, both large and small -- and there's a great many of these off the Strip, in places where only the locals would think to look. Hidden gems like this are hard to find, even more so when everything around you is a gem! Which is all the why I value this place: Zenaida's Cafe.   A cozy little restaurant in the middle of town, Zenaida's is run by another culinary heavyweight in town: Sterling Burpee, the former executive chef for the Wynn Resorts. Taking his experience on the Strip and opening up an eatery named for his wife's and daughter's middle name, Zenaida's is truly one of those hidden gems of Vegas!  While it's known for its breakfast and brunch fare, Zenaida's ALSO hosts a spectacular jazz dinner once a month on Fridays, where you really get to eat like a high-roller on the Strip! This review is thus special in that it will focus on both the regular visit from the weekend before last, and the jazz dinner from this past Friday.  During the brunch hours, they offer all sorts of breakfast and brunch fare from eggs and sandwiches to vegan and vegetarian options. There's something there for everyone, no matter what you can or can't eat! For brunch, my father and I ordered the same thing: their corned beef hash, a generous and flavorful bowl of beef and potatoes topped with eggs of your choice and scallion hollandaise, and served with toast. It was a flavorful plate of food -- and we also got potato chips at the start of the meal and complementary dessert in an apple berry cobbler! Everything was delicious -- and at such an affordable price, this place really has it all.  The jazz dinner is also just as amazing -- my mother, being the jazz aficionado of our family, was my guest for that dinner. Here, you get a prix fixe three-course menu with sumptuous options like filet mignon, veal, and seafood! My mother ordered a Caesar salad, linguini with clams in white wine sauce, and tiramisu, while I got lobster bisque, filet mignon with truffle butter, and a bananas foster creme brulee.  The food I ordered was excellent -- the bisque was touched off with brandy, which I could taste in the soup itself along with the fresh lobster. The filet mignon was perfectly tender and cooked medium rare, the way I liked it, though I do think the butter could have melted more prior to service. Everything about the main course was delicious. The dessert was the biggest surprise, though -- the bananas foster creme brulee wasn't overly sweet, but you could still taste every component of the dessert in it. It was my personal favorite item on the entire prix fixe meal. My mother also enjoyed her dinner immensely, though her only complaint was that the clams in her linguini weren't served in their shells. All the while, we were serenaded by a local jazz group, the Eric Vaughn Trio, who were enchanting to listen to!  During the entire experience, Sterling would come out to check on us, talking to me about how things have been since we last saw each other, and wishing us well when we left -- and that, I think is the magic of Zenaida's. Good food, good people, the charming ambience of the restaurant interior -- it doesn't feel like you're eating at a restaurant. It feels more like you're visiting a friend you haven't seen in a while, sharing a meal and catching up on what's new. That charm is something many restaurants in town lack, and the main reason why I'm such a loyal regular even though I hadn't gone there in months prior to these visits. Zenaida's prides itself on \"just good food\", and they deliver -- so why not check it out for yourself? Don't let the location scare you, this place is DEFINITELY worth the trip!",

    "text": "I will start by saying that one main of the reasons I find to visit beautiful Las Vegas several times a year is to dine at Zenaida's. I had one bite of the Vegan Scramble (a jasmine fried rice dish w/ tofu) and was instantly smitten. - In fact there are so many VEGAN options not to mention vegetarian choices that today when deciding to finally try something other than the vegan scramble for once I didn't know what to choose! I opted for the off regular menu special of the Vegan Cabbage Rolls. - I still got an order of the vegan fried rice to take on the plane tho! The cabbage rolls had jasmine rice, quinoa, ground veggie meat, and a delightful spiced sauce of tomatoes accented with fermented black beans of all things. It made for a meritage of flavors I quite enjoyed. After the complimentary house chips and aioli, paired with an appetizer of Mac and cheese balls, fried of course, not to mention some of my dining companions gigantic (and heavenly warm, gooey and delicious) cinnamon roll joining the party, I was unable to finish the rolls as the portion is quite large. A great plate to share if you are getting a few things to split. You also get complimentary warm cookies at the end of your meal.  Service is always warm and on point, and chef always takes the time to stop by every table, no one excluded to thank them for coming in and ensuring they enjoyed the meal; when he is not behind the line himself or overseeing operations. Don't forget they are closed Monday and Tuesday. It is also a small cozy restaurant so expect a wait during peak times, it's typically fairly quick for 2 tops, the larger the party the longer the wait.",

    "text": "In a city that is saturated with endless miles of strip malls all containing at least one restaurant of some sort or another, I believe we have found the best one of the bunch!  Zenaida's Cafe is a complete jewel! The interior is CLEAN (rare in Vegas these days) and beautifully decorated. The staff was wonderful and provided the most friendly customer service (also rare in Vegas these days) of anywhere we had experienced during our trip. Now, the star of the show - The Food!  Everything was amazing, but I need to focus on two particular items that will leave me with life-long memories.    First, the bacon! Now I know you're thinking, \"Bacon Love is so 2014,\" but I'm telling you that this was the best bacon I've ever had! It is thick cut and cured to perfection! It was really meat candy!  Finally, the Avocado Toast! Lord, this was everything every other Yelper said it was and MORE! Beautiful, delicious and perfectly prepared and presented!  The perfectly thin garlic rubbed toast, topped with quality ingredients; avocado, heirloom tomato, pickled onion and a balsamic drizzle - WOW, just wow!   The owner came out and was super cool! So, if you're looking for an off-strip, fantastic breakfast, this is the place! Thank me l",

All you get is the salt and a couple ribbons of low quality sausage.  We got the chicken and waffles which has a few slivers of chicken breast that over cooked so they are tough.  I think the best things here are the sweets. Stick with the cinnamon roll.",

    "text": "A group of my nursing classmates and I, tried Zenaida's today for brunch. When we walked in around 12, we were told there was a 20 minute wait, although we saw many tables open? After observing a few minutes it looked like they only had 1 server. Being that this place has 5 stars, I didn't let the wait bother me - plus the 20 minutes went by quickly especially if you have group of friends to converse with- plus the wait gave us time to review the menu in detail ;)   Today I tried the Quinoa Burger. This dish really surprised me, with its rich flavor from the pita bread, sauce, melted cheese and fresh slices of avocado - I was really shocked with the flavor it consisted of. It's exactly what you would imagine a quinoa burger to be. So the quinoa was compressed to give an illusion of a burger patty, unfortunately it did not stay together for long and it ended up becoming a yummy mess. My friend ordered the eggplant stack! This I would totally order again. Basically it's a breaded egg plant on a lettuce, and tomato \"protein style burger\" (no bun). It basically tasted like a onion ring but with more flavor.  Please note: after your meal your server will be bringing out fresh baked cookies, compliments of the chef. These will probably be the best cookies you've ever tried.   This place definitely serves up some unique dishes and I would recommend it for others to try.",

Stephanie was a great server and was sweet enough to help us take our plates outside to take a photo.   We ordered the smoked salmon plate and the BLTA Sandwich - I didn't prefer the Slab of bacon used - I like regular & crispy bacon on mine but that's just preference.   For free they offer housemade chips w ranch on weekends, and cookies after your meal every day. thanks I'll be back to try out other items! :)",

From healthy quinoa burgers to a fantastic Z Monte Cristo that was to die for, I'm sure there is nothing on the menu that could disappoint. And, as others have mentioned, their bacon is incredible. Thick cut, extra crispy and not soggy and sad like I've had at other spots. I love that depending on your taste, you can have your share of comfort food or something lighter. I will have to come back for the Crispy Eggplant Stack which sounded amazing. I can totally appreciate the creativity and effort they put in their dishes.  Service is phenomenal. That above all is the reason why I would return on my next trip. Very warm, genuinely kind people that work that there who truly love what they do and take pride in the food they prepare. A rarity nowadays.   Thank you Zenaida's Cafe! We are sure to return. 5 stars.",

My 9 year old loved the steel cut oatmeal. Had to take away 1 star because we ordered a side of wheat toast for him that cost $2.95 and he was served 1 slice of 4x5 inch wheat bread that was cut in half that looked like it came from a generic store bought loaf. At first we thought maybe they weren't going to charge us for it since it was so small, but alas we were wrong. The fresh baked cookies at the end were definitely a plus. Great coffee too.",

My friend order the bagel lux with salmon and she said it's the best she's had on the west coast! Which is saying a lot  I switched it up and order the Monte Cristo, it was not disappointing.

My pet peeve is when a breakfast place doesn't serve decaf coffee, they do serve decaf, \"instant\".  No thanks. How about iced tea?  Is it fresh brewed?  No. Well dang.  Water it is. One star is taken off my review for that.   We ordered the homemade cinnamon roll, it's beautiful but when you get past the delicious whipped cream and berries the cinnamon roll was kinda dry. Bummer.  I ordered avocado toast with a side of poached eggs.  It's not your average breakfast avocado toast, it's little toastlets (yeah I made that word up) so the egg wasn't a good match but it was tasty with the arugula salad.  My hubby had chicken and waffles, he liked it, I thought it was very sweet, even without syrup.  Service was good, as we were finishing up he brought us cookies compliments of the chef but we were full so we couldn't even taste them. The chef also came out and thanked us, and every table in there, for coming in.  One star gained for that. The personal touches raised my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  Definitely worth a try.",

Tiny spot in a off-the-main drag location but O! the food was spot on! We ordered Biscuits and Gravy - the biscuits were light and fluffy, the gravy was savory and not too heavy, and the spicy sausage links added a great kick. The pork medallions over hash browns were covered in green onions and a delicious bearnaise. The waffle was crisp and golden. The Salmon and bagel platter was HEAPED with salmon. I loved it all so much I placed an additional three orders to take home to the family that was sleeping in! Bonus -- just when you've reached food coma and your attentive waiter has refilled your coffee for what you think might be the last time... you get cookies and cream as a sweet finisher to your meal. Absolutely drive down to Trop and Pecos and get in on this delicious breakfast / lunch spot. Wear your stretchy pants!!",

Took my wife and five sons here last Saturday morning before hitting the casinos. My oldest sons both had breakfast burritos that were huge and delicious.  Two other sons had fried chicken and waffles.  I tried their waffles and they were delicious. Another son and I had eggs and thick sliced bacon and wheat toast and everything was great, especially the bacon, which seemed freshly cut from a slab of pork belly. My wife got a mammoth sweet roll. The service was excellent. The chef did come out to talk to us and we also got the complimentary strawberry shortcake.  This will be our go-to breakfast place from now on.",

During the Alpha Kappa Alpha 2017 Leadership conference discovered this gemstone of gastric pleasure and satisfaction. You must try the avocado toast with arugula and balsamic vinaigrette.  If you are a shrimp and cheesy grits connoisseur you'll rate Chef Burpy's among the best.  The chicken and waffles are off the chain. There is nothing on the menu that will cause you dissatisfaction. When you've finished your meal and the ambrosia arrives you get an unexpected visit from Chef Burpy thanking you for coming.   This is your opportunity to thank him for a culinary experience equal to a meal at the Bellagio, Top of the World or equivalent. So good that I made the trip to Zenaida's cafe twice during my 4 day Las Vegas stay.  Well done and I'll be back!",

    "text": "It's rare in life to meet a truly special individual, someone who is so talented that you just feel privileged to be in their presence. This is Chef Sterling, one of the most talented, humble, kind & welcoming people I have ever had the privilege to meet.   It was one week ago today that I was looking for a new breakfast spot to try. Having lived in Las Vegas for 20 years has afforded me the luxury of eating at pretty much every breakfast place in our lovely city. Many have come and gone and many remain eternal, however I can safely say that none have ever been as amazing as Zenaida's.   Living in close proximity to the M Casino currently makes going into town or the strip a pain and typically to get a truly epic breakfast/brunch you have to be willing to travel. But being a foodie I have done it, several times in fact. My willingness to travel is what allowed me the honor of finding Zenaida's as my wife was craving shrimp and grits.  I saw that Zenaida's was being heralded as having good ones, so I looked at the menu online. Immediately I felt something was off. The menu had many items and the description of those items were similar to some of the best restaurants in all of LV. I was extremely intrigued and did a little more research and found one of a picture of a previous \"Friday Nights Menu\" online. I almost burst into tears upon reading it. It had things I hadn't seen since my grandma made me dinners 30 years ago! I knew instantly that this was going to be special.   I was so worried that we would have to wait over an hour to get in here that I called ahead and asked how long the wait was. The lady that answered let me know there was no wait. I was shocked and we immediately headed down that way (a bit of a drive from the M). Upon arrival we entered and were greeted promptly and were seated. I was looking at the menu and tormenting over what to try when Chef Sterling came out and asked if I had any questions.  He was so accommodating and patient with me. Ultimately I went with the corned beef hash with slab bacon and my wife went with the shrimp and grits. The complimentary potato chips arrived first. Lovely. Very thin and light and I knew they were made in house as was the aioli.  Then the magic happened... The hash... OMG the hash... It was prepared flawlessly. Every detail was perfect. The presentation, the texture, the amount, everything was unreal. The slab cut bacon was also epic. Slab bacon is hard to find in LV and rare to have it cut the right way and even rarer to be prepared correctly, this order was both. My wife being from the South knows grits, she said right away that these were so good that when her mother comes and visits next she is bringing her here as they were among the best she has ever had. We also received a complimentary dessert of cookies and cream. AMAZING!  This meal was so good and left such an impression on me that I went back today (got home about an hour ago) this time I brought a family friend as he had to listen to me rave about it all week! We both ordered the hash (my second time) with the slab bacon. Half way through the meal he looks me dead in the face and says \"Carlos, this may be the best breakfast I have ever had in my whole life\". I just nodded my head in agreement and kept on eating.   Upon finishing the hash, just when I thought it couldn't get any better... it happened... the impossible... yes the impossible... The Cobbler. It came in two small serving cups, so unassuming, so innocent. I picked up my fork, my friend followed suit. We both took a bite at the same time, we began chewing. It started slowly at first, this feeling... of joy... I was soon overcome by... what was this feeling??? Bliss, pure bliss.   It was not only the best cobbler I have ever had, not only the best dessert I have ever had, it is in the conversation of one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life PERIOD. The waiter came over and I asked him if there was any way to get a full order of it! He asked \"you want some to go?\" I said \"NO!! WE WANT TO EAT IT RIGHT HERE!!\" A few moments later we had a full plate of the what can only be described as a little piece of heaven. Of course we ate the whole thing.   This is the best kept secret in all of LV, the ultimate hidden gem. Selfishly a part of me wants to not tell anyone about this unbelievable place. However, eating the food that Chef Sterling prepares is something that everyone should experience as he simply makes the world a better place with his unmatched skills. In going here you will have some of the best food you have ever tasted and it will have been prepared by a person who truly cares about not only his food but about his customers. Chef Sterling cooks every dish with love and you taste it in every bite you take. Those of you who know the difference between good food and True greatness will appreciate this place even more. GO HERE!!!!!  Thank you Chef Sterling for all you do!!!!",

I got mine to go and it was still just as I would've had it in the restaurant. The service was great. A little bit pricey, my salad ended up being $15 with The salmon added, but well worth it for the quality. Will definitely be going back",

I'd prefer they cut the meat up, use less eggs and put the potatoes inside.  My husband ordered the Montecristo sandwich and it was excellent.  I would try them again but order something different.

No, he just passed right by me, glanced at me and kept walking. Server dropped of check, I didn't even bother to ask for refill or anything because I just wanted to leave at that point.

My girlfriend got the Sausage Monte Christo and let me try it. Both plates are very tasty and fill you up. There was no more room in my stomach for more food even though I wanted to try more things. I'll be back for then though. I highly recommend this place to anyone. The service really deserves 5-stars. Can you believe the chef came out to say thank you for stopping by and he hoped we liked the food. AND... we even got a dessert for free. What else could you ask from a restaurant? Come here!!

The portions are amazing as well. My parents had gotten cheese grits with THE BEST sausage I have ever tried, then their second meal came out. Corn beef and hash and tri tip!

If you're in the Las Vegas area and struggling to find some vegetarian/vegan food, I recommend checking this place out.

I read the reviews and we decided to stop in for lunch, and found the place to be delightfully busy for a Thursday afternoon, so that was a good sign.  A lot of the reviews that I read mentioned the cinnamon rolls, so we ordered one to split and were super excited when this giant, warm and sugary confection topped with a softball sized scoop of fresh whipped cream showed up at our table. It was amazingly delicious, we were sad when we finished and the waiter took the plate! We will absolutely be ordering that again :)  For our main meal, my husband ordered the chicken and waffle and I ordered the cheesy shrimp and grits with my eggs over medium. My husband declared his chicken and waffle to be one of the best he has had in a long time, if not ever, and he expressed wishing he just had a plate of the chicken and some syrup to keep eating. My shrimp and grits were served in a giant pool of some sort of sauce/ gravy, which I was skeptical about at first but quickly fell in love with. In the great fork vs spoon debate for grits, I lean towards the fork side, and the sauce made these a little thinner than I normally like, but I'd eat these as a soup if it came down to it. The egg was a nice touch and further added to the richness of the dish. If I had to find anything wrong with my dish, I'd say the shrimp were just slightly over cooked. Otherwise, this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Our meal concluded with a greeting from the chef, who was very nice and apologetic for the wait on our food (there really wasn't one, very normal wait), and cookies sent out from the kitchen to each table. We were stuffed, but you don't say no to free homemade cookies, which were warm and gooey and amazing.  We plan on going back very soon and are excited to try many of the other dishes on the menu. I highly recommend this establishment and hope it sees much success for years to come",

    "text": "Chloe wanted pancakes and we were across town, a side we rarely travel to. We searched \"pancakes\" near our \"current location\" and Zenaida's Cafe popped up. 5 stars and about 150 reviews?!  Hmmmmmm...our curiosity was sparked!   We pulled up. It looked like a little \"homemade\" Italian restaurant from out front.   We walked in, and I was utterly confused.  The decor definitely throws you off.  There's this colorful tile that really doesn't do much for the space, and an awkward lounge spot right near the front door with fake fruit in a bowl and everything. Hmmmmm....  The tables are not very inviting...the overall look of the restaurant is not really enticing. If it didn't have 5-Stars, we would have walked out before we even sat down.  There must be something about the food or Yelp has really done us wrong!   We were seated in a 2-top off to the side of the room.  The waiter came by to take our drink orders.  I requested a decaf coffee and he quickly responded \"it's instant!\" I scrunched up my nose and politely declined.  \"We will just take a water then...\" This place is not off to a good start.  I didn't know restaurants would ever serve instant coffee in this day & age haha!   We couldn't quite decide what to get. For me, the menu is really limited.  A lot of bacon / pork / beef options but I don't eat any of those things.  I settled for the basic breakfast with 2 eggs, turkey sausage, breakfast potatoes and English muffin (even though I can't eat gluten). They don't have gluten-free options.  Chloe ordered the waffle.   As we waited for our meal, the waitress brought over a pail of homemade chips with garlic aioli. THEY WERE SO GOOD.  Thin, not overly crispy, and seasoned to perfection.  The aioli was good, but it wasn't needed. The chips were amazing as a stand-alone.   Our food was served quickly.  My eggs were perfect.  I was actually really impressed with how perfectly \"over medium\" they were.  Turkey sausage was just OK.  You can't really rate an English muffin. They are always good haha!   Chloe's waffle, on the other hand, was INCREDIBLE.  The waffle itself was fluffy, thick and served to the perfect texture. It was covered with homemade whipped cream that I think was sprinkled with cinnamon.  There were fresh cut strawberries covering the top of the waffle.  It was soooooooo good.  She didn't use any of the syrup provided. The whipped cream was just the perfect sweetness to compliment the waffle. On the side, Chloe opted for the thick-cut bacon. She said it was amazing.   After our meal, they brought out some homemade cookies complements of the chef. The cookies were topped with their homemade whipped cream. The cookies were warm and delicious.  We took 2 to go, shared one at the table.  Wow.   The service was decent. The chef came out to touch tables before we were served, but had he come out after we ate, I would have thanked him for such a perfect meal.  With all of the chain restaurants and stuck-up chefs on the strip that just leave their name on the marquee while rarely making an appearance, I appreciated the fact that this chef came out to greet his guests and ask how everything is tasting.   I'm not sure if/when we can go back because it's clear across town, but this place deserves the 5 star rating it has.  Don't be thrown off by the decor.  It's really not an issue if the food is THAT delicious!",

On the other hand, I would have enjoyed the shrimp and grits way better if it had less gravy. The amount of shrimp in it was very generous though !  Homemade chips with their homemade aioli sauce really nice touch !! Family feel with great genuine little touches made this place better in our book!

To many great choices but I doubled down with the Avocado Toast ( Best I have ever had ) and then Best Bennie I have had in awhile the Hollandaise was a good as my own. Was so good that I considered taking some Mac and Cheese on the road.  All capped off by a visit from the Chef and a gift in the form of homemade Chocolate Chip cookies. We won at the Slots but the real Jackpot was Zenaida! THANK YOU JESUS!",

Yelpers did not steer us wrong since this place deserves 5+ stars! The food was amazing - we tried the oatmeal, bagel with lox, and the lite breakfast. All delicious! The piece de resistance was when the chef came out and asked how things were going, and then a few minutes later came out with the most moist and delicious cookies with freshly made whipped cream. Delightful! Chef Sterling Burbee is a highly experience & trained chef, as you'll see along the wall of fame wall in the restaurant, and you can tell he really cares about his restaurant (which we assume he downgraded to have a more mellow life after commanding huge kitchen operations in another life). We wish Chef Sterling the best and can't wait to visit again when we're in Vegas!",

    "text": "My husband was looking for a nice place for breakfast on a Sunday morning, and was wanting something different. He found it!  We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door. After looking at a few photos on yelp, we thought that there was a regular menu of items to choose from. We like to split a meal, and maybe get a side of something as well. We soon realized that we were given a Brunch Menu. (update 1/11/17 ***I have been informed by another Yelper that they are no longer serving Brunch) This is not what we had been anticipating, but the price was so amazing at $13.95/ person. And on the menu was Eggs Benedict, so I was sold.   There were 3 courses for the brunch. I chose the Yogurt Parfait, Eggs Benedict and an Apple Cobbler. My husband chose a traditional Fresh Smoked Salmon Platter, Eggs Benedict and Cheesecake (this one was to go).  We each got a coffee and water. Our waitress brought a plate of large cut lemons for our waters, and brought us fresh brewed coffees. They do not bring around a pot to refill the coffees, but rather bring a fresh mug. The coffee was strong, but good.   My yogurt parfait had blueberries and raspberries along with a half of a strawberry as garnish. The yogurt, granola and fruit were all wonderful. I could have eaten another, but this one was huge! It was just so good. The smoked salmon platter had red onion, capers, egg, tomatoes, Dijon and salmon of course. It came with soda crackers, or what reminded me of them. We were also given freshly made potato chips that were seasoned wonderfully. They were thin and crisp, and were paired with a tasty aioli.   Chef Sterling came out to our table and talked with us a bit. He asked if we were enjoying our meal so far. It was great to learn that he had been the executive chef at the Wynn, and that he had recently opened this awesome restaurant. He asked if he could go ahead and start our Eggs Benedict, and then proceeded to prepare them. After they were brought to our table, he came out to let us know that he uses hand carved, slab cut bacon in his benedict. OH MY GOSH!!! I ALWAYS get bacon instead of Canadian bacon, but hand carved...slab...cut..Wow. I didn't even know this existed. I took a photo of our bacon from the side. You need to look at it, it is so thick. Yum! He makes his hollandaise sauce for each order as well. It was light and flavorful. His potatoes were tender and very slightly crispy as if they were flash fried. The seasoning was perfect. We could not eat all of our breakfast, so we asked for to-go boxes. But then we had an apple cobbler because, why not?!   AMAZING. It truly was. The apples were sweet and wonderful, nice and hot with a side of vanilla ice cream. I did not ask if the ice cream was homemade, but it sure tasted like it could have been. I would not doubt it. It was creamy, and perfect with the hot cobbler.   Chef Sterling's attention to detail is impeccable. This was the best dining experience that we have had in a very long time, and it was just supposed to be a simple breakfast. What a treat. We are definitely coming back to try out more of Chef's goodies. You must come here. You will not be disappointed. He does not advertise, and mentioned Yelp! He asked if we had heard of it (umm...maybe! :D ) So come on Yelpers, check this place out! We wish Chef Sterling all of the best.",

I'm on their mailing list and each week they send out that week's \"Additions\" which are basically the specials for the week (Wednesday through Sunday).  My taste buds and I are always amazed at the new offerings each week, and more often than not that's what I get.    This week's additions included a pork loin stack that was incredible. It had blackened pork loin medallions on top of a potato and onion hash and topped with eggs over easy and a tomato-spiked Hollandaise sauce. They finished the meal with a complimentary warm cookie topped fresh whipped cream.   This is an excellent spot to meet your friends and family for weekend brunch. If you get there before the rest of your party you can enjoy a cup of coffee in their lounge area while checking out the small photo gallery. They serve a Primo Columbian coffee and the servers always keep your cup full.   They are very adept at handling large groups as well. I arrived one morning just after a party of 14 had been seated, and despite my fears that I was in for a long wait for my meal, I was served just as promptly as always. If you have a large group they will take reservations.   If you have a sweet tooth be sure to try the cinnamon rolls. Be warned, however, they are huge so you'll probably want to share. The breakfast burger and the eggs Benedict are also excellent choices. The chef makes each order of Hollandaise sauce when you order your meal, so if there is something on the additions menu that includes Hollandaise sauce, go for it!",

But his caring and concern for his customers come across in every bite of food. Most especially in the little desserts that are passed out at the end of your meal. As great as what I ordered tasted, this was heaven. Prepared by the chef's wife, this is shows that this is clearly a family run business. All hands on deck.  I suggest everyone in the area give them a try, because this hidden gem deserves our support.",

Eggs Benedict and the cinnamon roll are absolutely perfect. The chef even gave us chips with a garlic aioli on the house to start off and they were delicious. And at the end of our meal he sent out another plate for us which was the highlight of the whole dining experience. We came back today and it was dejavu. Great food, and at the end of the meal the chef sent us some kind of banana bread with a really warm sauce, and ohmylawd. He even came out and said hi and thanked us for coming in! Something special! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good breakfast! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.",

I can't even begin to write about how good this place is! Everything was fantastic, the coffee, the eggs Benedict, the fantastic homemade chips with their addictive sauce. And the bacon. Thick cut and perfectly cooked. Even my super critical husband couldn't find a bad thing to say. The service was friendly and kind. After our meal, while we were in a daze of happiness, our server dropped off a plate of cookies.   I usually mock the reviewers in my head when they write that they don't want to share how good a place is because it'll get too popular and they won't be able to get a table so easy anymore.  But here I am, hesitating to submit this little review.  Zenaida's is so good!  Go there as soon as it's daylight out and pat your belly from sweet sweet satisfaction afterwards.",

I am not often impressed by pancakes, but these were memorable.   During my most recent visit, I had the biscuits and gravy. Amazing. The biscuits were fluffy and addicting. They were covered with a creamy, meaty sauce. I could barely eat half because it was so filling.   The ambiance here is charming. A little confusing, but charming. Multi-colored tiled floors and local art hanging on the walls makes me think of a club house I had in middle school. The music seemed to play one jazz song for my entire visit (in a charming way).   The staff have always been super sweet. A very attentive server always checked up on me. And the chef made the rounds and said 'Hi' to everyone in the restaurant.   The food and service were amazing. The ambiance is interesting. Overall, I will definitely be heading back.",

They also always give special attention to our little one, making us feel comfortable to dine with a rambunctious little toddler. We would definitely (and already have) recommend this quaint little spot to anyone!",

    "text": "I am thrilled with my new find, Zenaida's Cafe on Pecos at Tropicana. As you can see from the photos on their website, the atmosphere is casual, cozy, and very relaxed.  Smooth jazz is a welcome change from the sometimes loud, intrusive music of more fast-paced restaurants. Jamie said the most popular vegan dish is the tofu scramble with an Asian slaw. Everything is fresh, light, and savory. There are several other plant-based options on the menu, which makes this the ideal place for me, as well as my friends. Chef Sterling has been raised on a plant-based diet and knows how to create delicious and truly healthy dishes. Locals and visitors alike will be pleased to add Zenaida's to their favorite restaurant list.",

    "text": "You know when you're afraid to try new places because it may not be as good as you thought it would be? Zenaida's is the complete opposite. It's the kind of place that makes you want to kick yourself for not going there sooner.   The location and signage makes it a little hard to see and find. I first saw it when we went to Taco y Taco. We decided to stop by today for breakfast and the restaurant was decently busy. Jazz music was playing in the background. We ordered the avocado toast to start, my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the tofu scrambled. Along with our avocado toast the waitress brought out a basket of chips with aioli. The chips seemed homemade, they were thin, salty, and as long as a full potato.   This was my first experience having avocado toast and it was unreal. The garlic of the toast blended perfectly with the creamy avocado and the tomatoes were juicy. It was a perfect starter and I officially know what the hype is with avocado toast.    Now my boyfriend gets biscuits and gravy pretty much everywhere that offers it. This biscuits and gravy blew his mind. He is convinced it's the best he's ever had. The gravy wasn't white and coagulated, it was full of sausage chunks. The biscuits were dense and split in two so there was a great balance of gravy to biscuits. To top it off they add hot links! This reminds me of how every breakfast in Alaska comes with reindeer sausage. I could have just eaten the hot links as a breakfast.   By the time I got to my tofu scramble I was pretty full already. The scramble was presented on a long plate in a log formation, similar to how fried rice is served. It was full of huge chunks of broccoli, cauliflower, rice, and mushrooms. If you don't really like tofu, go ahead and get this scramble because it's very well hidden and it's basically like a breakfast vegetable fried rice. My favorite part was the furikake and nori tucked inside.   The meal ended with a warm chocolate chip cookie for both of us. My boyfriend was seriously smiling the entire time we were there. We can't wait to come back and try everything from the zucchini fries to the monte cristo to the chicken wings. Best hidden gem in the neighborhood!",

I wish Yelp would make 10 stars available and I would give it an 11.  Got vegan tacos for myself along with sharing a breakfast platter and the garlic fries with my wife and the food is so amazing.  Chef came out a couple of times to talk to the customers and when I told him we need to keep this place hidden,  he said it is why he does not advertise which goes against every single rule in the book you can find!  We are on the email list for his special nights when he serves bolognese(I won't say the surprise but you will love it) sauce and looking forward to that!!",

The breakfast potatoes are PERFECTLY cooked and taste almost like curly fries, but they're not greasy or overly-salted. The owner is also extremely gracious and welcoming.   This is how much I loved the food: I was visiting all the way from California and I'd been looking forward to going back here. The day that I went, they were closed because they were in San Francisco for some kind of event, hahaha! We traded places and I had to settle for a different, not-as-good-as-Zenaida's restaurant that day. My \"NOOOOOOOOOOOO\" when I saw the Closed sign could probably be heard from miles around.",

I was first very impressed- the chef of the restaurant was the one doing most of the serving to the customers. He also brought out a rose for the mom we were with since it was mothers day, so sweet! And at the end of the meal, they brought us out cookies for dessert, free of charge! So sweet- would definitely frequent here if I lived in town!",

We took a few minutes to order and were hungry, so we ordered avo toast to hold us over while we decide. A few seconds later a server bring out chips to munch on and so I asked to cancel the toast..I mean it was just something to munch out while we looked..She looked annoyed, but canceled. I ordered Monte Christo and my daughter the chicken and waffles. The monte christo tasted good with the flavors blending well and the potatoes were crispy and yummy. My daughter loved the waffles, but she said the chicken was a little rubbery. I was going to give a 4 rating, but then we were given free cookies as 'compliments from the chef'. I've obviously read reviews about these and when given, it was very obvious the plate had three cookies , but one was removed...I felt grossed out by that..was it an old plate? Was it from someone else's table that only ate one?? Other Yelp photos that showed two cookies you could tell was played for two cookies. This one was played as three and one was gone. Yuck.",

It's very homey, and the rainbow checkered floor makes me so happy. There's also jazz music playing in the background. You feel quite relaxed here.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated promptly. The service was amazing, as the staff frequently checked in with us. The chef also walked around the room and chatted with customers. I love that personal touch.  I ordered the Trio Salad, which was essentially three types of salad - egg salad, tuna salad, and lobster salad. It normally comes with grapes, but they were out and the chef personally came to ask me if I would like watermelon and strawberries. I said yes, and was very pleased as they were extremely juicy and sweet.  Before we got our check, we received chocolate chip cookies with caramel drizzle, compliments of the chef. That was a very nice touch and greatly appreciated.   From looking at their menu, it looks like it's also a great spot for breakfast and brunch. I will definitely be back!",

I highly recommend this place is you want to leave with a belly FULL of yummy food. The vibe here is super chill! Give it a try!!",

The eggs Benedict is easy the best I have ever tasted, the hollandaise sauce is light and not to rich and it is made with thick cut bacon that is to die for. The waffle with cream and strawberries was so delicious it could be ordered as dessert. We cannot say enough about how good it was. The staff was not only fast and efficient but they were super friendly, we felt very well taken care of. It was clean and had a really pleasant atmosphere. We will be back!",

My sister had their pancakes, thin but so fluffy served with thick slices of bacon.   The top dish that I LOVED is the corned beef hash with eggs over eggs, covered with hollandaise sauce   This was the best homemade dish I tasted the entire time in Vegas. We got homemade chocolate chip cookies drizzled with caramel and served with whipped cream. That just complimented the meal so perfectly.   The staff was great, very pleasant. We got the pleasure to meet the owner, Sterling. He was also the chef. We found out he caters for Southwest Airlines and he was dated voted ebony magazines top 15 black chefs in America. That sure as heck made a lot of sense after our meal. I hope you will give this restaurant a try. You won't be let down.   Thank you Sterling and Zenaida. We will definitely be back! Aloha",

When I couldn't decide between two dishes, Eric did a nice job helping me to choose. Awesome food! We both totally enjoyed both meals.  Hubby ordered the Collins Breakfast Burger. So yummy!. He described it as one of the best breakfasts he has had in a long time. Delicious homemade burger. Everything about the burger was just so good. Carmelized onions, medium burger, over easy eggs all done right.  I went with the Sausage Monte Cristo. While I'd argue it wasn't really a Monte Cristo as it wasn't deep fried, it was delicious. The spicy house chicken sausage had a kick to it and the ham was so tasty. Served on a toasted baguette, this was a really nice breakfast sandwich.   Overall, a great experience and highly recommend to all my Vegas friends.",

The atmosphere is family oriented, unlike the flashy casino restaurants. I'm certainly glad that we have a family style place to dine in Las Vegas.

Seems they have only been around about a year or so, Atmosphere is very casual and very open area. The wait was about 10 or 15 minutes, we were attended to right away and had our drink orders taken. No shortage of attention given here we had the brunch special of an open face crab meat and spinach omelette and home made seasoned potatoes with tomato bisque soup and choice of fruit plate or cheese cake for desert, chose the fruit plate. We shared the meal and the portions are very healthy. Service was excellent. The Chef came out to check and greet on the customers too  I recommend this place for sure and we will be back again for sure  Luis V, Las Vegas Nv",

I ordered the homemade corn beef hash and eggs that came with yummy hollandaise sauce, which made it totally amazing! Chef added a special touch with some warm homemade cookies... made us feel real special.   Food was fresh, tasty, and served hot.  Restaurant was super cute and colorful.

I had the special short rib hash with soft scrambled eggs. It was incredible. Then the chef (and this place has a real chef) sent out a complimentary dessert. I was too stuffed to eat much if it, but it was very good.   I recommend trying this place soon. Word is going to get out and I predict when I return to Las Vegas in a few months I might have to wait for a table here. They have only been open 6 months but word will spread and this will be become a hot spot. Get there and enjoy before the crowds do.",

The first person that greeted us was a young girl who was very sweet but, not very attentive.They brought out house made chips First with a bloody Mary aoli. The chips were delicious and crisp and the aoli was very unique and yummy.  We then ordered the zucchini with the garlic aoli which was very tasty. The zucchini was crunchy and fresh which complimented the crispy planko crust well.The garlic aoli on the other hand tasted like plain mayo. I order the Mac and cheese with sausage and my girlfriend ordered corn beef and hash. My Mac and cheese was swimming in grease and cream and was very poorly proportioned. It was a huge bowl of Mac and cheese with 4 little sausages on top. And it did not have good flavor at all. My girlfriends corn beef and hash was delicious. The eggs were poached perfectly but, it was a large quantity. It was enough for 2 people. The customer service was not very great. The two people on the floor walked past us several times without asking us if we needed anything even tho we were clearly just sitting there waiting. There was an older lady that was not friendly and when my girlfriend smiled at her she gave her a dirty look. They gave us complementary cookies which were tasty but, the presentation was messy. Overall this place had a good start and good end but, just got a little messy in the middle.",

In addition, I ordered homemade grits sans the cheese-I like mine sweet.  While awaiting my meal I was served homemade chips - a weekend special- with bloody mary aioli. They were so very delicious I took my leftovers home.  The Benedict came with thick slab bacon, perfectly poached eggs, a thin English muffin, and a wonderfully prepared homemade sauce- and potatoes (which, in my opinion, were overkill because I was to full to eat them). The grits were better than mama's!  Chef Sterling holds a tight reign on his kitchen, calling out timings to his young cooks. Towards the end of my meal the Chef visited all of the tables and chatted diners up. It was all very personable.   I will be back!!!!",
