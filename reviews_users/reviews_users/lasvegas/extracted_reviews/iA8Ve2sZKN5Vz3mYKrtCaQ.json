    "text": "On my quest to find the best Thai food in Vegas, Komol is taken out of the race.   LOCATION: Yes, Komol lies in the same shopping center as the Green Door. The Commercial Center has all the characteristics of a shady place. Its old, a little dirty, and you'll likely pass a few hobos. But hey, there's a few good places to grab a bite.   FOOD: What strays me away is the wild inconsistencies between visits. Sometimes its good, sometimes its great, and sometimes I'm left disappointed. The stir-fry's usually come out quite good here. The usual Pad Prik King and Chili Mint Beef have never led me astray. But I must suggest to steer clear of the Yellow Curry. I believe the cooks are confused whether or not its a sweet curry or a savory curry. Its different every time. On occasion, I'll order a Pad Thai. Despite being a generic Thai dish, there are quite a lot of components involved in preparing the seasoning. A heavy hand on the tamarind or fish sauce WILL be noticed. The flavor varies visit to visit so I can't say I love it 100% of the time.  SERVICE: The servers have always been really nice. The young man who usually waits on us is seriously one of the nicest most genuine servers I've ever met. But I'm not sure if they're understaffed or just relaxed.  When it comes to food, patience isn't my strong suit. Whether the restaurant is full or nearly empty, it takes forever to get our first plate. Entrees never arrive together and at times its hard to distinguish whether they forgot our order or its just coming out slow. Also, they're a little stingy on the napkins; request a couple extra before your food arrives.   Komol has one of the largest, heaviest menus I've ever seen. Real talk, it is really heavy! A few pages of food are sandwiched between big chunks of wood. But what they gain in variety, they lose in quality.",

    "text": "Had dinner here tonight with a friend. A little hard to find, had to drive around the center for a minute. Decor is standard Asian restaurant fare. Service was slow and impersonal. In their defense, it seems like they have two servers to wait on and bus the entire restaurant and they were fairly busy tonight.   Food - Tom yum soup was ok (kind of hard to screw up). I ordered some fried squid which was hard and tasteless and the sauces seemed off. The waitress took that off our bill when I asked her to take it away after barely eating any. Sea bass with ginger sauce was decent, not great.   My friend ordered the fresh spring rolls and veggie delight, which were both a little better than my food (we shared), though those seemed more along the lines of Chinese-American dishes than Thai food. Maybe I ordered the wrong things or it's mainly geared towards the vegetarian food, but I thought everything about the place was pretty mediocre. They do have a large vegetarian section in an already large menu, but it's not that hard to find good vegetarian friendly meals in any Thai restaurant.  I love Thai food, but I can't see myself coming back here. The food tastes more like an average Chinese restaurant than a real Thai place. It wasn't too expensive fortunately - about $55 for one appetizer, a cup of soup, two entrees, and two beers, plus tip.",

A perfect retreat from sensory overload and a quiet place to catch up with a dear one. The service is attentive and unobtrusive and the bathrooms are clean.  Of course the most important part, the food! Komol's vegetarian offerings have expanded over the years to include gluten and soy duck along with the tofu and mushroom options. Pretty much everything they have on the meat menu they have on the vegetarian menu. I try to get something different every time, but I have a weakness for fresh spring rolls in the summer and tom kha in the winter. This time I got the Hot and Spicy Vegetables with green curry and gluten. Delicious! I have enough left over for lunch today too.  Their thai iced tea is delicious--if I ever save room for dessert I am totally going to thry their homemade thai iced tea ice cream.  That other Thai restaurant in Commercial Center may get the press, but the locals know Komol's the best!",

    "text": "All of the Thai restaurants I've ever tried in America all share something in common: the food can range from disgusting to delicious, but it never tasted truly authentic. It was missing this quality that I can't put my finger on that I had in all the dishes when I was in Thailand. Thai food in America is all very saucy, pungent, and overpowering -- which, don't get me wrong, can be INCREDIBLE sometimes. But the beauty of the Thai food in Thailand is that it's not very saucy, pungent, and overpowering, but still maintains this tastiness that I've never experienced in America.  Until now.   Komol Restaurant is the most authentic Thai restaurant that I've ever had in America.   Just take their Pad Thai for example -- it's probably less saucy and orange-colored than you're used to. The Pad Thai flavor isn't as strong, but for some reason, each bite releases a delicious taste that isn't like the overpowering and sweet Pad Thai that you're used to in America. Even the Pad See Ewe, which is usually dark brown because of the overuse of soy sauce, has a lighter hue at Komol, but still packs in all of the unique flavor that Pad See Ewe should have.  The Herbal Salad, which is highly reviewed on Yelp, was good, but a little too pungent. It's like your typical Rainbow or Tea Leaf Salad at your local Burmese joint, but with way too many overpowering flavors.  The curries (Panang and Masamun) are both delicious, but these are more standard tastes that are pretty much the same in Thailand and in America.  Also, they make an excellent Thai iced tea.  I don't want to sound like a Thai food snob or connoisseur. It's very likely that I have no idea what I'm talking about. But I love Thai food and I love the Thai food I had when I was in Thailand. I'm not a professional -- just speaking from personal experience, and this is what I know to be True for myself. What I know to be True now is that you're not going to get a more authentic Thai food experience than at Komol.",

    "text": "You must get the all green stir fry.  I have had a secret fantasy for quite some time now, and Komol was restaurant enough to make it happen this week. At every Asian restaurant I visit, I try every trick I know to maximize the amount of green vegetables in my dish. I will ask for \"Only Broccoli\" and hope they don't upcharge. I will specify no water chestnuts, no baby corn. My fantasy, you see, is a 100% green stir fry, and I had pretty much given up and accepted that the mere cost of such a prime produce creation must be daunting to most Asian kitchens.   So, my tastebuds did a second take when upon closer inspection of the Komol menu I discovered an all green, basil stir fry! Snow peas, American AND Chinese broccoli, and bok choy - I almost wanted to run outside and scream to the world, \"I found it!\" It may be simple, but purchasing and chopping all of these items is too much of a commitment for me.   So for me, this is a perfect dish. At least twice a week, I just want a big pile of alluring greens, and this is just that. I will wake up craving this very soon and very often.",

Lucky me, some of the best people in Vegas came to join us for dinner.   BF and I tried the famed herbal salad and it was a refreshing treat. I love salads of all kinds and I never thought of coconut being something to add. Now that I know how it is made, I will be making this at home and trying out the rest of the large menu.   Massaman Curry- I am a huge massaman freak so we had to try this on our first visit. It was very spice heavy in a cinnamon-y profile and sweet. While I appreciated it is unique, it just was not quite my thing.   I  dont get their spice rating...while our herbal salad was more \"medium\" spicy than \"mild\", our massaman had no spice to it at all. Seems in some reviews I read to be inconsistent.   Tried bites of my friends foods and all were quite nice so definitely there is good quality here. The pad thai and panang were quite good actually.   Service was okay, a bit slow though they were nice about it.   Hard to say if it is food we need to drive across town for yet, but when I'm in the area I will definitely be coming by to taste more.",

    "text": "The food at Komol is definitely worth the trip.  My family and I still remember how good all the dishes we ordered (and we ordered a little bit of everything) was!  It's a little difficult to find, because the area that Komol is located in is surrounded by a lot of office buildings and some other assorted restaurants (including at least one other Thai place to make it extra confusing).  But I'm glad my family and I looked around for it, because the food is fantastic.  And there's a pretty extensive menu, if my memory is correct. The place has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options in particular, which is great if you have a big party and people who are particular about certain foods or ingredients.   And I remember that the hostess was so sweet and patiently explained everything to us.  She checked in on us several times in a nice but not irritating way to make sure we were happy with our food as well.  I do remember that if you choose something spicy, it will be very spicy.  So consider that fair warning if you can't handle the pepper heat!  This place is at the top of my list for the best Thai food in town, regardless of what the Las Vegas mags might say.  Do try it and see what you think.  Everything on their menu was delicious, from their curries to the appetizers and drinks, so you can't go wrong with Komol.",

    "text": "For those who are not aware of this place - yes it looks like you've entered the wrong part of town. Be not afraid! Keep going in, cuz you are in the right spot!   We are fans here. When hubby craves Thai food, we only travel here. For him, it is bringing his memories back of seeing the foods on his travels there when he was younger. (and he has been looking for a place like this for a very long time - TRUST ME!)  Right after entering you are greeted very quickly and seated promptly (or are given a good time estimate if waiting is the only option) They love kids here and are well prepared to accomodate towards them.  Hubby leans towards Pad Kee Mao (or some variety of the wide rice noodle). I like to mix it up. Papaya Pad Thai is very tasty - hubby wasn't super fond of it, but for me - I was just lapping it all up! Since we had the wee one, we had to keep it mild - :( - but one of these days we are hoping to have all mouths on fire!  The soft shell crab app is YUUUUMMY! Gives you that perfect taste, but doesn't weight your belly down so you get to fill up on the main course!  Chicken Chili mint - very awesome! Fire and ice in one bite!  Seafood Basil Fried Rice - yuuuum! Can't tell you how many times I have been here with all the food, but I have never been disappointed. I always strive to have something I didn't eat the last time just to be able to say at one point that I have eaten everything on the menu!   Oh and let's not forget our beverage staple: Thai Iced Tea - traditional, (and now) red or green!!! Wish I knew the secret to making it, love it so very much - someone has told me before it was Lipton tea, but somehow I am doubtful - and am striving to know the secret to it. (note for the great internet research project).   Now juuuust to be fair to the competition in the same parking lot - there is a Lotus of Siam restaurant nearby also Thai cuisine, but have yet to explore their restaurant.   And lastly - can't review the desserts, since our bellies are always full to the brim by the time we are done! (oh did I mention you get to take home leftovers too?) That's right more bang for your buck! Ok now my tummy is getting hungry for Thai food..... hmmm Happy dining!",

First the great one...herbal salad.  You should definitely order this.  It's got a mix of apples, herbs, lemon grass and is a great mix of flavors.  Definitely my favorite plate of the night.  We also had garlic prawns and a soft shell crab appetizer which were both pretty good.  The prawns were a tad on the salty side but we had some rice to help off set it.    The lowlights would have to be the penang beef and the pad see ew noodles.  The penang curry was missing some flavor and the beef was tough.  The pad see ew were very bland.  I've better in many other places.  Would I go back?  Maybe if i couldn't get into Lotus of Siam.  I'm sure there's more dishes that are good here, but it may be a while before I go back to find them.",

Just pretend you didn't see all the sketchy other stuff, and head inside.  You can get soy chicken, soy duck, soy shrimp...maybe soy beef (?) instead of meat for anything.  I got the orange soy chicken.  It was great.  They didn't over-sauce it.  The chicken came in stick-like form.  Sounds weird, but it was good, and made for easy eating-with-my-hands.  I want to try the orange soy duck next time.  I also tried my old man's vegetable panang curry.  Normally, I HATE curry.  Even the curry that you say \"oh my god, this is the best curry, you have to try it!\" I will hate.  However, I had just finished a soccer tournament and was dying of starvation.  Something about that made me want to try the curry, even though I was expecting to hate it.  But, alas, I liked this curry!  I wouldn't want to eat an entire order of it (note: I HATE curry), but I did supplement my orange soy chicken with a few bites of the curry and it was really good.  So, if you like curry, it is probably awesome here.  Great choice for vegetarians, I'd definitely go back.",

It's my favorite vegan place to visit in Vegas as a non-vegan (makes sense, right?). Actually, my whole family loves this place. The appetizers are reasonably sized and priced. Delicious thai iced tea, and they can make it vegan. The spring rolls, egg rolls, and fried tofu are all great. We always get the pad see ew and it never disappoints. The desserts we've had, coffee and thai iced tea ice cream, were delicious. I tried the homemade coconut ice cream with sweet sticky rice this past visit.

    "text": "OK, If you like Lotus of Siam and maybe planned poorly by not making  reservations there, have no fear and try Komol Restaurant - they are both in the SAME strip shopping center!  Komol is in the center of the parking area for the entire strip mall and is easy to miss if you are not looking for it.   Having walked down near here to visit another location on a Sunday, I already knew LoS was closed for lunch and yet I wanted more Thai.  Yelp came to the rescue and delivered me to another outstanding Thai restaurant!  I could hardly believe that two of the best Thai establishments I've eaten at in the US are in the same location!  Hmm.. maybe its the location - what looks to be 40 year old, barely maintained strip mall not terribly far off the far end of the Las Vegas strip.   I agree with another reviewer, its hard to believe both LoS and Komol are within eye-shot of each other..Karma anyone?   As I mentioned in my LoS review, this is too far to walk for 99.9% of the Strip crowd, so be prepared to take the bus or a cab.  You can get here on the bus w/ a single transfer and then only have to walk a short distance across mostly parking lot to reach Komol.    The interior is nicely decorated and they have many of the awards they have won clearly posted near the entrance.  I was so glad to get out of the afternoon Vegas heat and it was plenty cool inside.  I immediately ordered a Thai Iced Tea and water, water, water.    The wait staff was very attentive as I had 3 Thai Iced Teas before I left but I'll get to that and lost count on the water refills - that dry Vegas air is tough.   After scanning the huge and varied menu, I must say I was overwhelmed with the choices and options and it took me a while to decide.  However the Chief's special looked right for me as I honed in.  It is a blend of spicy herbal curry sauteed with string beans, carrots, bell peppers and basil leavers.  I omitted the bell peppers and asked for an \"8/10\" on the heat scale.   The dish arrived promptly and I took my first bite - wonderful but then the heat kicked in and well as another reviewer said, beware of the pepper scale.   Normally, I can eat all but the extreme 10/10 Thai hot levels but 8 was too much for me on this dish .  There is NO WAY I could have eaten it without the cream in the Thai Iced tea to calm the heat!  I asked the waitress about the \"8\" rating and she said that dish was normally hot b/c of the chili peppers already in there, she had recommended milder for most customers.    It was good, but damn was it hot!   I highly recommend scaling back on your normal heat rating scale or be prepared for a hot but delicious ride here!   You can always turn up the heat after the dish arrives!   If you love Thai food, then you have 2 great locations in the same strip mall and honestly, you cannot go wrong at either one..  Give Komol a try and you will be rewarded with a Thai meal you won't soon forget and be glad you took that ride!  Did I mention they cater to vegetarians as well!",

While from the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall, once you go in you'll see its quite nicely decorated. Other than the teak engraved menus, the food is the main star of this place and rightly so! we had the tom yum mushroom soup, pa kang vegetables and red curry chicken. all were equally delish but highest points go to the soup! Best thai I've ever had!! we were in Vegas for 3 days, and needless to say, we squeezed in 3 trips! Great service, ambience and food..and did I mention its super cheap? amazing....the only downside its kinda hard to find ...its in a strip mall with tons of korean food/karaoke/bars around but you'll enventually spot it. Skip the fancy food on the strip and go to this joint..you'll love it.",

The flavor was great & spiced to perfection based on our request.  We then tried the soft shell crab with garlic.  There was plenty of garlic, which I love & this is now my favorite soft shell crab dish I've had.  Also tried tempora shrimp & vegetables, and their panang curry signature dish.  On the side was added red spice in case anyone wanted more heat on their plate.  Everything was great & everyone at the table loved the food.  Service was excellent.  We were well taken care of by Dutch & Ann.  Both friendly, attentive and willing to go the extra mile for the group.  The finishing touch was the fried Vanilla ice cream.  That was the sweet treat I needed to complete this meal.  It made my weekend afternoon nap that much better!",

I have been to this location over 15 times and absolutely love the food. So why not 5 stars?   The way I was treated last time was unacceptable. I entered the restaurant with two of my friends for lunch. First, the waiter was incredibly rude and just brushed us off. It took 20 minutes to even get us water and take our order. Mind you, at this time, there were not many people in the restaurant. Nonetheless, we place the order. After about 40 minutes, we began to get really restless. A very large group of people came in and they ordered immediately. Other customers came in and ordered as well. We complain. 30 minutes pass. No food. We complain and are told to wait. Again. The other people that came in WELL after us begin to receive their food. We complain again and get told our food is on the way. 15 minutes pass, my two friends receive their food. I had to wait another 25 minutes until I got my food. How is this possible?! AND my curry was lukewarm! We did not even receive an apology.   I asked for a manager and there was not one available. I asked for a phone number and I have called at least 10 times to complain and always get told the manager is not available at this time. Unacceptable. Not coming here ever again. I feel bad for taking my friends here and making it sound like a respectable restaurant.",

It accommodates to tastes from the heaviest herbivore to the heaviest carnivore, and allowing some options for the fungivore as well.  My friend Linda, ordered a beer and a hot saki - satisfactory to the casual diner who orders a couple of drinks with the meal.  She ordered the Vegetable Delight and I - The Tom Yu Chicken Soup with Tofu. While after sampling both dishes, they are not extraordinary to me, I will give them a thumbs up.  I was a little irritated of the indifference from the three waitresses. While they were a little busy tonight Friday, it is not that they had a full house ( there were about six tables ) and they couldn't even bother to walk by our table to check how we were doing?",

It was also pretty busy for lunch! Long time no see Komol!   BOMB BITES:  One of my favorite salads in town is their Herbal Salad, so we ordered that and since it was a bit chilly, a bowl of Tom Kha(spice level 1) also sounded great.  Our food didn't take too long because all we ordered was a soup and salad, but the soup came first. It was good, but  boy did it pack some HEAT!?!? Aside from the heat,  the dominant flavors were coconut, lime, and fish sauce. I prefer to make my Tom Kha with a little more aromatic flavors (more lemongrass, kafir lime leaf, and galangal) which was barely evident, but still good. The herbal salad arrives and we dig in. All these memorable flavors are what made me a fan in the first place. All of the fruits,  veggies, tofu, cashews, and aromatics. Mysteriously, our mouths started heating up again!? A few seconds later, we discover that the same dried chili that was in our soup also made its way into the salad. Although we enjoyed our meal, our tastebuds were ON FIYAH! Out of curiosity, we asked our waiter if chili is usually in the Herbal Salad. He said not normally...feeling bad, he brought us some rice to hopefully tame the heat in our soup and that secret sauce that goes in the Herbal Salad to tame the heat in the salad. What service!  CLOSING STATEMENTS:  Now everyone who frequents Thai restaurants are familiar with the Thai Spice number system with 1 being the most mild (yeah right!) and 10 being \"you so crazy!?\" hot...just be forewarned that unless you love spicy, even level one packs a punch! One of the ladies from the kitchen came out explained that it was also the season for the chilies from Fresno that they use which meant that they are more potent than usual. She thanked us for coming in and sent us off with another Herbal Salad with no chili. :)  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5  Will I Return???  Yup!",

    "text": "5 Stars? Absolutely.  From the outside Komol doesn't look that impressive. But Komol has been one of my weekly lunch places for over 2 years now because the quality of the food keeps me coming back. Service every so often slips a little which explains my previous 1 star reviews. But when I start craving Thai food this is where I go, and I usually walk out very satisfied.   Panang Curry or Chili Mint Chicken, medium heat = happiness.   I try not to hand out 5 Star reviews anymore but Komol's earned 5 Stars from me before and its the only rating that seems to fit. Lotus of Siam across the parking lot may be more hyped, but Komol in my opinion is the better choice.",

    "text": "The Skinny: came in for lunch - food is subpar compared to other Thai places in the city (2), service is slow (waited 30 minutes before food came out) so forget coming here to grab a quick bite (2), value: $6.95-7.95 sounds reasonable for lunch specials but the food ain't that good. Pass (2).  We wanted to try another Thai joint in this plaza but we found that it wasn't open early enough for me to get to work. So we hit Komol instead.   I ordered the pad thai lunch special while the hubs ordered the stir-fried eggplant special for $6.95 each. The lunch specials come with soup/salad with spring roll. We both opted for the salad with the curry peanut dressing.   The spring roll lacked filling and was flavorless.  The very meager pile of romaine was overshadowed by the gnarly goopy peanut butter based dressing on top. Not appetizing.   Pad Thai was really weird and oddly sour. I was not impressed that they left the long browning tails of the bean sprouts on the sprouts -  a) it's unappealing,  b) it has a nasty hairy mouth feel, c) any Asian worth their salt knows you can purchase bags of this completely and properly prepped (without the head and tail of the sprout) from Chinatown for dirt cheap. Portion size was small.   The eggplant dish was truly horrible. On the edge of raw,  the eggplant had an unpleasant styrofoam like texture. Lacking wok hai, the dish was bland and unpalatable. Served with a side of rice,  the amount provided was meager but given the poor quality it wasn't a bad thing.   Service was slow. It took a while for the food to arrive (at least 20 minutes for the spring roll and salad,  30 minutes for the entrees). Definitely not a good place to grab a quick 1 hour lunch.   Given the quality of the food and the slow service,  there is no reason to return. 2 stars.",

The first time I ate there, a roach walked across the women's feet seated in the booth behind me as I head them scream and jump, The food was delicious so I tried not to think much of it...   The second time I was there recently, I ordered the Tom Kha soup, and as I sipped my soup I got an interesting texture which I thought tasted odd, I took it out before swallowing and I realized it was actually a small circle piece of cardboard. When I told the waitress, who had taken a while with my food having served my friend her food a while ago, I was brought another soup, however I was still charged full price for this. I was very bummed out because their food was tasty, but after these experiences I'm not sure I want to return.",

I am in love with their Herbal Salad which has a mix of shredded apples, carrots, onions, cashews, cilantro and a special sauce.   I also like their soups Tom Ka soup which is coconut based.  And their Panang Curry over some rice is a must.    Just make sure to inform your server how hot or mild you want your food.  On this occasion we were informed that even their mild was a little too hot due to the pepper season and location they receive their peppers from today.   The service we received was really spot on and for this all of the above, I am a fan.",

Customer service was great once I walked in I was quickly greeted and the hostess seated me with a table for 2.   I don't really eat a lot of Thai food so this would be a first. For the appetizers we ordered the shrimp mushroom soup in Thai it is called \"shrimp Tom yum\" and you can have it on a spice level 1-10 of your choosing. In this case a 4! It was the perfect spice level. For entree I ordered the Thai broccoli chicken and shrimp with black bean flat noodle and my friend ordered the pineapple shrimp fried rice.   It was amazing! And all the items in the menu are healthy at a decent price. Too bad there summer rolls don't come with meat, that's the only downfall but overall I am definitely coming back!",

Papaya salad was a hit, and so was every vegetarian and non vegetarian dish we ordered, including the quintessential pad Thai and chicken Penang..

The restaurant was packed, so I understood the service being a little slow.  We had to ask for hot tea about 3 times, and we finally received it toward the end of our meal.  We also got a side of sweet and sour sauce when I asked for the chili and hot sauces.  The chili sauce came toward the end of our meal, again, and when i took the lid off, they were pretty much empty.    I don't know if it's because I've been so spoiled by all the amazing authentic restaurants in Thai Town in LA, but the food here was mediocre.  The tom yum soup did not have as much flavor as other tom yums I've tried.  But the presentation was cool (see picture)!  Our group ordered 2 chicken pad thai dishes and both were super dry.  The best thing we ordered was the Panang curry.  It was spicy and had lots of flavor.    One thing that I really wanted to get if I wasn't so full by the end of the meal was the mango and sticky rice dessert.  Looked so good!    I'd probably say if you have the time and patience, wait for LOS.  It has to be better than Komol.",

My friend got the pad thai spice level three and enjoyed it.  I tried a bit and have had better, but it was still good.  Both of us had the lunch special with comes with choice of soup or salad and an egg roll.  The egg roll is good and any place that gives you spicy mustard with your egg roll is a winner in my book.  We both got salad.  I got the peanut sauce dressing-yum and she had the ginger dressing which she liked.

    "text": "Quickie review: This is my favorite Thai spot. They never disappoint with food. I love the restaurant itself. And we usually receive top-notch service. Though I have moved further away now...I continuously go out of my way to frequent this gem.  Food:  This place has a wide-array of food to choose from. You'll probably notice from other reviews that Komol does have a good vegetarian/vegan selection. I don't mean like 10 choices...I mean pages of vegetarian/vegan options. They have a lot to choose from and with their various serving sizes, from individual to family meals...they can accommodate any group situation.  There food quality is always top-notch and they're consistent. People like to counter good reviews about Komol saying that Lotus of Siam (in the same shopping center) is better. While I will not deny the quality of Lotus....when it comes to a quality/cost ratio....Komol wins.   Pad Thai, Pad Zee Ew, Herbal Salad, Go See Me, Tom Kha and their curries are generally among the dishes we always order. For a taster, try there individual vegetarian meals (which they will make un-vegetarian for you)...you'll get to try appetizers, a soup and a large entree for the price for a great price. Not to mention, they have amazing lunch specials which basically make you feel like you ripped THEM off considering the amount of food you get and what you paid for it. Seriously.   Atmosphere: Though the restaurant is getting more and more popular, it still has the feel of a quiet little spot. Pictures and artwork on the wall give it a home decor and their carved wood menu holders are an interesting touch.  Service: Typically, Komol has fast and friendly service. When's it's busy, the food may take a little long but it has never been ridiculous. The staff is willing to offer suggestions and are happy to introduce you to surprise dishes that you might have overlooked in their voluminous menu. Our last visit was a very rare night of bad service....like really bad....but I am going to chalk that up to a new server. If this becomes a trend, I will change my rating.  But, on the whole, all of our visits have been pleasant.  Overall, if you want a great meal, especially with a group that wants to avoid checks that will easily hit the triple-digit mark like at Lotus, come to Komol. Their food never disappoints and you usually leave stuffed to the point of shame. And that's saying a lot considering I am the same guy who has zero shame about pounding down a triple-chili burger from Tommy's and can happily look at myself in the mirror.",

Sometimes you come across places that are vegetarian and it definitely feels like it is. As a person that enjoys meat, I did not miss it one bit when it came to Komol.  The Vegetarian Platter: was a bountiful fest of lightly battered fried spinach, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and tofu. It reaffirms that you can fry anything and it would be amazing.  The Chicken Noodle Soup: was just that. Nothing special, but it was welcomed on this cold day. No I am not talking about my experience on the date right now.  The Herbal Salad: was everything everyone raves about and more. I loved the crispy fried tofu skins mixed in to give it more texture. The dish does not lack in that department or in flavor.  The Vegetarian Delight Curry: was good. The eggplants, green beans, and tofu in a rich broth could have used more of a kick. We ordered it mild in case they actually went Asian hot on us. Instead it was definitely not made for someone who likes a kick.  There was just so much food in the end. I am still in shock by the serving size here. The service was minimal, but since I was trying to get to know the person across from me, I was happy they only stopped by to drop my food and refill the waters.",

    "text": "Well Vegas is making a good run for my 5 star restaurants. I now have 3 restaurants in this shopping center I will go to (this is the only 5). Two of which are Thai the other Indian. Komol is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant I have ever been to. As you walk in the door you see all of their awards including several for best vegan restaurant in Vegas. Always a good sign.  As usual I used my Thai barometer to gauge the quality of the food. The tofu Tom Yum and tofu pad kee mao were spot on with a Pascal reading of FANTASTIC! I left a full and happy patron. My taste buds although burning enjoyed basking in the wonderfulness of what I had just consumed.  Parking is plentiful and price was decent especially for Vegas. If in Vegas get yourself off the strip and eat some Thai that is twice as good as anything you will find on the strip and half the price. The cab ride will pay for itself.",

Its in the Commercial Center close to Lotus of Siam, which itself was named \"Best Thai Restaurant\" by Gourmet Magazine I believe it was. However, I prefer Komol.  Their lunch specials are one of the best deals in town, but, the food is really what makes it great. I suggest the Chili Mint... anything really,but, pork and chicken are the best! Every curry dish I had was delicious too. If you like duck i would recommend the Pineapple Duck. Larb and Pad See Ew are off-the-hook also.   My old roomie was a vegan and everything I tried that he got like the Orange Peel Gluten, was awesome. Also make sure to get their Brown sticky rice, its the bomb.   Oh my god I'm hungry now.",

    "text": "Despite being an avid Thai fan, I have been to Komol (a Vegas Valley Thai favorite) twice. The first time was years ago, before I knew about its reputation. The experience was not bad, nor was it memorable. Since I have become savvy of its clout among locals, I ventured back there and - outside of the herbal salad - I was similarly underwhelmed. We had a sampling of four dishes and - the aforementioned glorious herbal salad excluded - nothing really stood out. It was all decent Thai food, but nothing more. And while it gets bonus points for that herbal salad, it certainly gets docked for the molasses service and (to a lesser extent) whatever it is that they call merlot in this joint (I know, what do I expect when ordering wine in a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant). With Lotus of Siam in the same parking lot, I do not see myself coming back to Komol.  Side Note: I get hit up for change at a ridiculous clip in this parking lot when I visit Lotus. At Komol, I was able to park directly in front of the restaurant. Instantly I thought, \"Well, at least I will not be hit up for change.\" Then, hilariously, I take two steps from my car and a dude asks if he can watch my car in exchange for some dough. It was like he appeared out of thin air! If mooching were a sport, the world championships would definitely be held in this parking lot.",

Either way, my dining experience at Komol was one of the most unpleasant lunches I have ever had.  The meat. Dear God Almighty, the meat. Perhaps they accidentally gave me food out of the garbage? I ordered the Red Beef Curry and it was disgusting, absolutely disgusting.   My co-workers ordered chicken and seemed to fair fine, but I made then sample my beef and they agreed it was awful. The bad beef alone might have gotten them three stars, but the complete disregard for the fact that they were serving inedible food is what gets them one star.   I did not eat even 1/5 of the food brought. When the waiter asked if I wanted to take the   rest home, I said no. I asked the other people if they wanted the food, and they all said no. One even said, \"That meat is awful\" while the waiter was there.   The server's response? \"Ok.\" Not a word of concern, not an offer to bring a new dish. Nope. Komol will serve you garbage and does not care if you hate the food, just as long as you pay.  Most restaurants notice, and care, if someone doesn't eat their dish and doesn't take it home either. That's generally the universal sign it was bad. Most restaurants will try to get you something else or ask if there's anything they can do to fix it. Not Komol. Komol wants you to pay and get out.  Given the great reviews from others, I'm assuming there are other, more edible foods on the menu. But, take my advice, stay AWAY from the beef. And stay away from Komol if you want a place with good customer service.  For a delicious Red Beef Curry, try Le Thai. The beef there is tender, high quality, juicy, and does not taste like garbage.",

So far I've tried the panang curry (once with chicken, once vegetarian), pad thai, eggplant with black bean sauce, house special duck, soft shell crab with garlic sauce, and a combination appetizer plate. One dish is better than the next. They've been spot on with the spice level both times- I asked for a little spicy and it was perfect for me- which I really appreciate. The staff was also helpful in suggesting dishes for the less adventurous eaters in the group.   My one complaint is the menu. It's this giant wood binder that's heavy and unwieldy. But other than that I can't wait to come back again and try more of the menu!",

We ordered medium spicy, 5, it was more like a 7-8, pretty spicy and we can eat hot.  The herbal salad was just ok to us, not a 5-star dish. The service was friendly but oh so slow, took almost 35 min. before we were served after placing our order.  Probably won't go here again, I like the Thai BBQ joint on 3rd street better.

And the overwhelming menu made my head spin-- we're talking pages and pages of dishes, folks!  But, then the food came out.... and the angels started singing. Now, we go about once a month with our veggie friends and have not yet had anything that has disappointed.  My meal always starts with the cold papaya salad (fresh, slim-cut papaya with finely chopped green chilis,  some salt and pepper to taste and a dash of lime juice - YUM and so fresh), and the tom kha soup.  Where it goes from there is anyone's guess... but it never disappoints.  My newest favorite: the sauteed flat noodles with faux duck. (I'm salivating as I type.)  4 stars are only because you feel you have to brave the elements every time you go.

They make it with ground meat of your choice so every bite is infused with flavor and spices. The chef's special is also a favorite and I highly recommend it to anyone. One of the least recognized items on the menu is the house special omelet. The name and menu description does the dish NO justice. It is to DIE for. The curries are all great, however, if you like a thicker curry, you will have to let them know as the standard at Komol is the runnier version, with exception of the panang curry. You can order the food pretty spicy. They go from 1-10, with 10 being pretty hot and then superhot levels 1-5. If you love thai food, this place is a MUST MUST MUST!",

    "text": "The thing about Komol is that they cater to Vegans and Vegetarians alike (myself included) and the food is actually good! The service is pretty good as the people are friendly and frequently check up on your drinks to refill them. My fav. here is the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Tofu Satay.  I love the spicy-ness of the Fried Rice and if you love spicy, say '10' to let them know how hot you want it... it's spicy but not too over the top. The peanut sauce for the satay is killer and I make sure to always get that when I come in.  Plus, the food is cheap and this place, although it SHOULD be crowded, is more of a quaint, tranquil atmosphere on most occasions; a characteristic I definitely enjoy.  I've also had the combination vegetable appetizer on many occasions and I enjoy that as well.",

I've probably been there at least a half dozen times and I have never had a bad experience. The menu is huge, both in content and weight, and they have a ton of options for omnivores and vegetarians alike. I usually get panang or red curry, but I've heard good things about the sesame beef, Indian curry, and sweet and sour chicken. The pad thai is some of the best I've had in Vegas, and the tom yum and tom kha are equally amazing.  If I had one complaint, the service can be hit or miss. It's never been awful, but it can be a little slow sometimes. However, I am perfectly willing to deal with slowish service if it means eating lots of cheap, delicious food.",

The spice levels are always right on the mark. I get up to a 6 or 7 usually, and it's got the right kick to it. The service is great and there are so many menu options it takes me quite a while to figure out what I'm going to order. My two favorite dishes so far are the Papaya Pad Thai and the Cat Fish in Red Curry Sauce. YUM!. I always have to get and then one extra dish to try something new each time.  I'm new to Thai, but it's quickly becoming my favorite!!! I'm officially a Thai Addict.",

    "text": "This place was outstanding. It's worth the drive through the currently Ghetto-fied surrounding buildings in what used to the hustling and bustling Commercial Center. So you don't drive endlessly through the 'sex clubs' and gay workout places and what not, jut drive to the island of merchants in the middle, Komol is there and it faces west.  Sort of near where the legendary Jeannie Moore's Arcade used to be (If they were still around, that would be 5 star rating for sure!)      On a weekday, Komal was devoid of patrons except for my guest and I. After looking over these heavy, wooden menus that were folded up like a high level spellbook from a Tolkien fantasy movie, we ordered the fried quid as an appetizer, and it was excellent! The size of the chunks of squid within the batter made me put those on my \"I have to back and try those again\" list. We also ordered Massaman with brown rice and and then we ordered this kind of shrimp soup. All of it was very, very good. My buddy and I (who can both put down food like their is a miniature black hole in our gullet) were able to barely finish. If you call how we left thing, 'finished'.     The wait staff was great, and the owner said goodbye to us on the way out. There were best of Last Vegas awards on the wall  If I dont' find mysef near Lotus of Siam (my current fave, but they have mooved to be near Paradice and Flamingo), Komol will always be where I go when I am craving Thai food and on that side of town.  PRO TIP: as with any establishment that offers a lunch buffet, do not order that.  Those buffets are for the uninitiated schlubs that will eat anything and call it delightful. You've come this far, now do yourself a favor and order off their heavy bafforr wood binders. (Bafforr? Find your nerdiest Star Wars friend and ask them to explain that reference to you).",

My boyfriend is a plant based vegan and loved his vegetable penang curry with brown rice (upcharge for brown rice). I thought my eggplant dish with black bean sauce (added beef, $1.50 more) was good yet I was hoping the beef was sliced not ground. The dish was not bad yet a tad oily for my liking.

    "text": "I am a huge fan of Thai food, I wouldn't call myself an expert at all, but I've been to more than enough Thai places (including the other 2 literally steps away) in my lifetime to know that Komol knows their stuff and knows it well. I always compare every Thai restaurant to Komol because it's consistently at the top of my list in best Thai food, and while I do enjoy some of those other places, it's always the food at Komol that holds that special place in my belly.   My personal favorites here (all of which can be made vegan or non-vegan) include Panang Curry, Papaya Salad, Tom-Kha Soup, Daikon Pancakes, and Green Curry Fried Rice. I really, really love that when I do order vegan, I don't have to adjust orders and worry about them not hearing me correctly or being annoyed. It's the one take out place I've frequented that's never messed up my order.   The spice levels (1-10) here that I order are always consistent. Portions are always a reasonable size & prices seem fair considering. Take out here has always been quick/easy to do though I wish they would jump on the trend of app/web ordering.  The only other con I would have is the restaurant itself.. it's very dated and not very aesthetically pleasing, not even in the charming, divey way. I would imagine it looks exactly like a little, old Thai lady's house who hasn't changed anything out in years. I almost always order take out. If I'm taking friends out to eat Thai food, sometimes I'll choose other Thai places because they have a better atmosphere even if the food isn't as great as Komol. I know Komol has been around a very long time, but they don't have to show it like all my wrinkles show my age. While doing some work on myself isn't a bright idea for me personally, it wouldn't hurt the restaurant to get creative and get updated with a few things.  Still, because of how crazy delicious the food is here.. a solid 4.5/5 rounded up to a 5 for me.",

What a surprize to find a vegetarian-friendly, high-quality place in Vegas. Far away from the glitz and located in a sketchy part of Vegas (pretty much everywhere but the strip) I found a place that takes Panang seriously. Not the watery lame curries that soil the name of Thai restaurants, but rich, flavorful, thoughtfully crafted Panang. The sauces were great as well as the fresh mint spring rolls. Friendly and delicious.",

Ask waitress for recommendations since it's hard to decide on one dish. They all look so good.  The restaurant is nice and clean and service is impeccable.   I will definitely  frequent  this place.

I am a huge fan of Thai food, it's like Chinese food on steroids YUM!!! So first of all, the menu is heavy... and I mean literally heavy, this wooden block is like 7 lbs... so be careful not to drop it.   Secondly, can you please get some legit hotsauce up in here?  If you do I will come here over lotus 9x out of 10!!! Rooster sauce, Sriracha,... come on get it together!!!   Their soups are good and hearty, vegetables aren't mushy and gross. (I always order wor wonton soup) Asians love soup!  Entrees are good here. And when you say spicy as 10 here, they will stack that entree with hella jalepenos so beware!!!  I always say 10 and half way thru the tears wish I got a 9.  Garlic Chicken extra onions spicy level 10 please!!!  thai ice tea here is just like everywhere else. nothing special.  Prices are reasonable.  AWESOME VEGETARIAN MENU!!!  Small dining area... not good for large groups.    Soda is never super carbonated.    I will still be back",

Trust me, all the food is excellent here, but these are the dishes I always order: Tom Kha Num Tok Panang Beef Garlic Pepper beef/chicken Herbal Salad- I dream about this   FYI 1. When you go to Komol if you say HOT they will make it HOT for you. Don't try to wear the Daddy pants if you don't have a belt if ya' know what I mean. 2.  Even though the service has been much better recently I still recommend letting your server know if you are on a tight time schedule. They will do their best to accommodate you.

I wish I didn't give up so soon.  A UYE motivated me to get my butt over here again.  I did drive around for a bit looking for it, but I was a little more determined this time.  The place is tiny and doesn't have a fancy neon sign like Lotus of Siam.  But whatever it lacks in flash, it makes up for in tastiness.    The panang curry was amazing as was the herbal salad.  The tofu nam sod with crispy rice was absolutely delicious.  My favorite dish hands down.  They aren't shy about the spice so adjust accordingly.  I like spicy and a 5 out of 10 was enough for me.    Service was good.  They kept the water coming, that's for sure.  Just get here early for dinner.  When I left, there was a line out the door on a Monday night.  They have a lot of inventive dishes, like pad thai with papaya noodles instead of regular old rice noodles.  Great for vegans and vegetarians, but there are meat options, too.  The menu is huge and has separate sections for vegetarian and non-vegetarian to avoid any confusion.  I probably need to try Lotus of Siam before I come back.  But definitely looking forward to swinging by and trying more of their dishes.",

It is so tasty. I don't like very spicy food so I just tell them 0 spice. I also love their brown rice, it's far more delicious than any other brown rice I've had. Their cucumber salad and crispy spinach are to die for. The restaurant is clean and they are very pleasant. The service is a little slow but that's because everything is made to order. I always bring friends and relatives who are visiting Las Vegas to Komol everyone loves it as much as I do.",

    "text": "I'd been here a couple of times for lunch previously, but never for dinner and never with my husband. Our $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate seemed like the perfect excuse to drop in for a date night.  Komol is fairly small. And there never seems to be more than a handful of tables occupied. It's a really nice little place with a good atmosphere.  We started off with the stuffed chicken wings. They were good, but mostly they were just interesting. I'm not sure I would ever order them again, but I'm glad I tried them.  We then shared the hot and spicy pork hock curry and beef chili mint. To be honest, neither were what we expected - though, that was certainly not a bad thing.   I typically do not enjoy curry dishes, but this particular curry dish was incredibly delicious. The beef chili mint was also fantastic.  When you order, you can choose on a scale of 1-10 of how spicy you want the dishes. My husband and I both opted for a 6. And while we both tend to find things others describe as \"hot\" to be merely \"mild\", the dishes were almost too spicy - but in that good way.  We then finished it all off with a dessert of fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  All in all, it was a delicious meal. To be honest, I think I actually prefer Komol to Lotus of Siam. And the service was excellent - up until it came time to pay the bill anyways.  When we handed our server the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate, he set it back on the table and said \"we don't take these anymore\". Uh, what? We purchased it. We purchased it for this restaurant. And it doesn't expire. But ok, fine. We asked a couple of questions about it as we were clearly taken by surprise, but didn't really get anywhere.   I suppose I can understand, but - and maybe this is just me having lived in Vegas too long - what irked me the most was that there was nothing done about it. No \"so sorry, we'll take care of those two beers\" ($8). No \"our apologies, your dessert is on us\" ($4). For us, it really took away from the overall service. And it takes away a star from my rating.",

I am sure they have been competitors for awhile, but I recently just discovered Komol restaurant and I am blown away by the flavor of the food!  I actually went twice in one week (seriously not planned) and both times the food has been great!  Service did lack a bit the second time, but the wait was worth it.   Things my friends and I got:   *Chili mint tofu with ground chicken - so flavorful!  MIx it with some fried rice, and this may be the only dish you need to order   *Pad Kee Mao - this is my favorite dish in ANY thai restaurant.  Wide rice noodles, cooked in some flavorful thai sauce with chicken, vegetables.  Very yummy.  (Although still cannot compare to my favorite place in Seattle xD)   *Herbal Salad - This type of salad was a first for me, especially in a thai restaurant.  It had a myriad of chopped veggies and apples, mixed in with lemon grass and a sweet spicy dressing.  Very refreshing and I promise you will not be disappointed...unless you are allergic to an item. ;-)  Also it is all vegetarian!   *Beef Panang - Very good, but I wished they added some kind of vegetable to it, like string beans or something.    *Curry Fried Rice - amazingly flavorful!  Each bite was a mouthful of curry and I could not stop eating this!   *Pad See Yew - Another great wide flat noodle dish.  Less spicy than Pad Kee Mao but just as or even MORE flavorful.  A must try!    *Green Curry - this was probably the only dish I was not a big fan of.  It was pretty bland, considering everything else was so tasty.  It may be that everything else was too flavorful that it washed out the flavorful of this particular dish....who knows.    I didn't really enjoy the ice cream served at this restaurant.  I wish it was more creamier.  The menu did state that it is home-made.  The thai tea ice cream flavor was there, but should be a bit creamier.    I will definitely be coming back here again!  Hopefully with more friends so I can order even more next time. =D",

But more important than that, we went for lunch just now. There were 4 of us and my 15 month old baby for who we did not order anything and we had her snacks she was eating. The service was terrible today. They barely came by and I had to get the attention of the waitress to bring us our bill. When we got the bill I saw a service fee for $8.60. I didnt know what that was for and she said it was automatic gratuity because there are 5 people in our group. We were so pissed. There are no signs anywhere that says gratuity is added on for 5 or more people. The standard for most restaurants is 8 or more people. Moreover, my 15 month old did not order food! And I have never heard of someone counting a baby as a person in the group for purposes of gratuity especially when we didn't even order food for her. And if that is their policy to include a baby for purposes of charging gratuity they should have told us ahead of time. Needless to say we did not add any extra tip and we will never ever go back. This used to be one of our favorite places to eat but that was sleazy I will never ever return. We also cleaned up after our baby's mess from the table and floor from the snacks she was eating so that can't even be an excuse.",

We ordered the Esan sausage, tamarind cod, chicken panang curry and cup of Tom Kha Soup.  When the sausage plate appetizer arrived, we weren't sure if the lettuce/ginger/cucumber was supposed to be rolled up and eaten like a wrap or everything eaten individually? I tried wrapping it lettuce wrap style and it was good, very flavorful sausage.  The chicken panang curry and tamarind cod come out and I think the cod was the star between the 2.  The cod was crispy and perfectly cooked with a sweet/sour tamarind sauce.  Never had this anywhere before but it was good combination with the other spicy and creamy curry dishes we ordered.  We ended the meal with coconut ice cream with sticky rice.  This was the perfect way to end the meal, not too rich or filling, very light,not too sweet and dairy free!  *portions are generous, menus are heavy!",

I usually order Medium at Thai restaurants, but I went with a 3 on this order because I was sharing with my non-spice loving wife. Man, that 3 was hotter than any Medium I've had anywhere. They don't mess around here!  Besides their super hotness, I'm a fan of this place because they have a truly vegan/vegetarian menu. I didn't need to quiz the server about the presence of fish or oyster sauce here. They even have vegan home-made vegan coconut ice cream.  We ordered the Vegetarian Pud Zee Euw (8.95; Stir fried flat rice noodles with broccoli and soy bean sauce w/choice of American or Chinese broccoli) and the Vegetarian Dinner Special  #3 (10.95) which included an appetizer (Spring Roll),  soup (Mushroom Tom Kha) and  Vegetable Pad Thai for the main course. They were all very yummy (and spicy) and among the best Thai food I've had.   Now that I know where this place is, I'll be back, but I have to say that it is not easy to find. It's in a large shopping center, and if you enter on the wrong side, you'll pass dozens of businesses before you find it. The best directions I can provide are: it's kind of in the middle of the commercial center, near a bar.   Pros: Very Veggie friendly with dedicated menu section Great prices Lots of parking Real spiciness Friendly service Entry way is filled with articles and awards (including a letter from Yelp!)  Cons: Location is a little shady and kind of hard to find",

I ordered the pad kapao and pad see ew, both were very good and had tons of flavor, but pretty heavy with the oils.  I am used to eating at Krung Thai now, which is a lot more \"clean\" vs Komol and Ocha being more \"authentic\" and oily.  I do prefer Komol's over Ocha if you were wondering.  We also ordered a fried rice, and it was very good.  Next time I come, I will try some Panang Curry since I missed out this run.  Hopefully, you can't go wrong with this place!

It's usually full, but no lines like LoS.  The vegetables are fresh, the spices--especially curry--must be something homemade instead of packaged, because they're distinct and uniquely rich.  We've been known to go here several days a week, because there's so much to try, and we have so many favorites, it really never gets old.  If you like curry, you really MUST try their Panang. It's unreal. Also a consistent hit with us is the Pad See Ew--it must have freshly made noodles, because it's truly addictive.",

Located in the bizarre \"Commerical Center\" off Sahara, a sprawling huge parking lot with restaurants, odd businesses, strange clubs and an occasional crack dealer and homeless guy with no shirt and a shopping cart stumbling around, we've come to love our dining experiences at Komol.  It's a friendly, family run place and we've had no big problems with the service like another recent reviewer.  Once seated you're presented with a heavy wooden menu! It weighs like 3 pounds!  They have great vegan options including soups, salads and wok-made dishes of all varieties, and a great portion of brown rice if you order it.  On a recent visit we requested that all of our dishes be prepared with as little oil as possible--but things were still on the oily side, especially our eggplant with black bean sauce dish which was positively greasy. It's almost as if the chef did the opposite of our request.   So, I'm deducting one star--I'm simply not a fan of lots of oil and grease in Asian food.  Bye for now; we'll see you on our next trip!",

    "text": "I swore the last couple times I've been here I said to myself never again. Komol used to be my favorite Thai Restaurant in town at one time. They used to deliver to my work, so I ate their food frequently. The last few times I've been there I have noticed the food isn't as good as it used to be.   We went there last night, had a reservation, when we arrived the employees were running around like crazy. The place was busy, but not anything crazier than I've seen it before.   We are seated and wait for awhile for someone to take our orders. She finally comes and we are both famished. Had we known what was about to transpire, we would've ordered our entrees. So we eat our salad, and she comes to take out entree order. We waited ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. I was so hungry I was close to walking out. Then, my entree arrives. Mine only. The waitress leaves the table. Doesn't say a word about my friends dish. I sit patiently staring at my food. We call her over to see what's going on and she says \"it will be out soon\". So I'm sitting there patiently for my friends food to arrive, where I come from it's rude to eat without everyone having their entree. Ten minutes later it arrives. My Pad Kee Mao was less than stellar. I ate the shrimp out of it and left everything else. Needless to say, I won't be going back.",

The food is a 5 and when Dutch is there, the service is too.  I knocked off a star because if you go on a Friday of Saturday, plan on waiting.....and waiting....and waiting. You will wait to be seated and then wait to get your food...and not necessarily in the order you placed it. At any rate, the food is always fresh and delicious and if you are a vegetarian, they will be mindful to not cook your food with oyster sauce or in the same cookware they use for the \"other stuff.\" Bon apetite'!",

    "text": "Food: I'm very glad this place's menu has a multitude of vegetarian options. The options are even available with soy meat. Started off with fried wontons. I mistook the fried wontons as being the cream cheese stuffed ones, but I was wrong. My first couple wontons didn't even have a filling so it was just friend wonton wrapper, but on the third one, I noticed something like chicken inside. Whoops. Then I had the shrimp pad thai at the \"Thai Spicy\" level which is their hottest level. The heat intensity was good but could've been hotter (I really like spicy food). I liked that the chili didn't detract from the flavor of the pad thai. But unfortunately, my shrimp was under seasoned and both the shrimp and noodles were overcooked. Noodles should have a little past al-dente consistency, but these noodles were rubbery and sticky.   Service: Granted I was there for a birthday party and there were 12 people on our table. . .but service was slow. Our waiter left a pitcher of water on our table and it showed just how they rarely came around. Once we'd ordered, it took a good 20+ minutes to get our food out. When the food came out, it was ticket by ticket since the check was split. One side of the table got food before everyone else. I ended up waiting at least 10 minutes after everyone else until my food was served. In Komol's defense, another person at our table didn't get her food until way after me so Komol comped her dish because it took so long. We kept asking for additional sake cups. It wasn't until our third request that we actually got them.   Overall: Service could've been better and I've had way spicier and better Thai food. I would go back to try their vegetarian options, but there are better options available in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been eating at Komols for years now and I'm finally getting around to writing a review. It obviously goes without saying it must be great Thai food if I've been returning for years. This week alone I picked up a Togo order on Wednesday and dined in on Saturday.    Today I rolled into Komols at 11am. That's when they open and they close at 10pm nightly. I started off with fresh spring rolls which are served with a peanut sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. Delicious. Next we had the Thai herbal salad which is spectacular and to die for. It has shredded apple, lemon grass, red onion, fried tofu, cashews, green onion, basil, carrots, and coconut with a hot pepper and lime juice sauce. Highly, highly recommend giving it a go. For the entree we ordered Pad-Kee-Mao which is a stir fried flat rice noodle dish with garlic, chili, tofu and basil leaves. Today I was in a spicy mood and ordered everything a 7 out of 10. I also order all my items off the vegan portion of the menu, which means they only use soy bean sauce, organic sugar, vegetable oil and spicy seasoning herbs. No meat, no dairy.  That's just my preference they also have a full carnivores menu as well.    The decor is classic Thai style and you can tell they've served countless satisfied customers since opening up shop in 1986.   The help has always been friendly and attentive. Even when they're slammed with customers the food still arrives in a reasonable amount of time.   If you stop in and see me chowing down throw me a high five and prepare to enjoy a great authentic Thai food meal.",

    "text": "We came here for a vegan anniversary dinner on 4th of July since it was one of the very few restaurants around Vegas that were open, plus we were excited to try a new Thai place that had a specific menu for vegetarians and vegans!   We were able to make a reservation easily over the phone and as soon as we got there, were seated right away. The menu is pretty huge so be prepared!   We decided to go for the Vegetarian Thai Style Fried Rice, a cup of the Tom Ka, The Chef Special \"Curry\" and the Combination Appetizer, with an order of Thai iced coffee (they use non dairy creamer btw!).   Food came out pretty fast, except the soup didn't come towards the end of the meal and to make up for the wait, they were nice enough to upgrade my cup into a whole bowl which I really appreciated.  Service was fast and the servers were very attentive in refilling waters and attending to your needs.   FOOD: -Vegetarian Fried Brown Rice - 1/5 this was way too sweet but to be fair, the server did warn us that it would but we figured that the spiciness level would mask the taste of the tomato sauce that is literally all over the rice. We had to ask for some hot sauce since it didn't have any spice in it at all but at the end we decided it wasn't worth eating.  -Tom Ka - 5/5 this was my favorite out of everything we ate and I wish it didn't come at the end of the meal when I was already stuffed but I'm glad I got to take a whole bowl home! It had the perfect amount of spice and veggies.   -Chef Special Curry - 4/5 this was my bf's favorite dish and it was definitely the level of spice we were expecting. The server did warn us that it isn't an actual curry and it's more of a dry dish but it was great regardless!   -Combination Appetizer - 4/5 I really enjoyed this because you basically get a variety of fried spinach, sweet potatoes, eggplant, spring rolls, and tofu to dip in some yummy sauce. It was a very filling appetizer for 2 people.  Overall had a good experience and it's in the same square as the famous Lotus Of Siam but I would definitely try this place if you're not looking to wait in line over there and still enjoy some good Thai food!",

When I asked for me she said flat out no. What the heck it's unlimited on the tables. Absolute ridiculous. I have a lot of vegan friends and belong to multiple vegan groups I have told them to never go back plus with the addition of GOOD VEGAN Thai food popping up all over Vegas there's no need to ever go back. See ya komol. Taking bets on when you close down.   I miss the old komol :( I live 45 min away and have consistently gone at least 2-3x a month for years. Because it's so good especially being a vegetarian but it's going downhill fast. I heard about the roach incident and then being shut down so I simply asked to see their latest inspection grade card before eating there and they gave major attitude. Um sorry I wasn't the one with roaches in the kitchen.   The veggies themselves has like no sauce. And we're half the size they used to be. Barely even half a plate full.   The pad Thai just seems cheap. No peanuts little flavor  The tom yum used to be my favorite but today it was so bad it tasted like unflavored mushrooms in water no thai spice or flavor at all.   So dissatisfied and upset. I want my old komol back :(:",

    "text": "I finally managed to try the oldest Thai restaurant in the Sahara Commercial Center. It didn't live up to its standards.  Komol is one of three Thai restaurants within a hop, skip, and a jump of each other, and it's almost certainly been around since before I was born. It's also the last of the three-headed beast of beloved, dare-I-say hyped Thai restaurants that I had to try. So I stopped in to try a lunch special today. It does seem like the decor could be from an older time, but it's still clean and has friendly waitstaff. It's fairly brightly lit and the atmosphere was relatively quiet when I dined in.  I chose the panang curry lunch special ($7.95) with beef, owing to recommendations from Yelp friends and the server's answer to my inquiry on which dishes were the most popular. They first brought out an egg roll w/ sweet & sour sauce and horseradish, and my choice of side in the egg drop soup. Both were good but not particularly impressive, and I found myself having to add salt to the soup.  The curry came out, and it was oddly... not high in temperature. Mostly warm, to be sure, but I  usually expect it to be painful to the touch, you know? This was perhaps an ominous sign. The curry was pretty good, but it wasn't as impressive in flavor as others that I've had, and I was surprised that the \"mild\" level of spiciness was a 1 or maybe 1.5 at best. I will say that the meat portion was very generous, although it was a fairly generic cut of beef. The veggies were fine but not spectacular and not as abundant as you'd expect from a place that specializes in vegetarian cuisine. My biggest gripe at mealtime was that the rice had a few grains that were hard (read: tough to chew, as opposed to uncooked).  The problem that I had later that afternoon was stomach pain. I didn't have an issue that required me to visit a restroom, but I'd give it a 3 or 4 out of 10, if 10 is the most tortured my intestines have ever been. I'm sure this was caused by Komol because it was my first meal in 16 hours, and that whole temperature issue was a tip-off.  I may give Komol another chance, but I'm not sure why I should be so generous with so many other great Thai restaurants in town, some of which are just a short stroll away.. My intestinal fortitude is the only reason that I haven't dropped the rating further, and if I'd had to drag myself to the toilet... you know the punchline.",

We asked for separate checks (which isn't that hard to do); we had to ask her 2-3 times to split our checks and she didn't seem to understand it. She got so frustrated with us she cursed at us \"Oh, shit\". To top it off she messed up our orders and did not hesitate to express her frustration with us. I started off my order with an appetizer and before I could finish she quickly interrupted and said \"Is that all you want?\". Thanks to Feng, we will not be coming back here and won't be recommending it to anyone.",

Service was horrible, i asked the waitress i have been waiting for 40 mins can you check whats going on, she started showing terrible attitude, while it was 100% the restaurants fault for letting customer wait 40+ minutes while it wasn't even that busy.

Not having been here before, this restaurant was a bit hard to find as it is located inside this large empty strip mall/plaza. The types of surrounding stores were sort of random so circling for awhile until the restaurant was finally spotted - yay!  It was mid afternoon by the time we got here so the place wasn't too crowded. A few of us ordered the green papaya salad, chicken green curry and fried combination noodles.   Everything was extremely flavorful and absolutely delicious! Will have to return for more next time when I am in town!",

Though I live in Henderson, I'm occasionally compelled to travel halfway across the valley and get my fix of  their Tofu Chili & Mint. It's the best you'll find anywhere... and good with gluten instead too.  The atmosphere is a very relaxed, hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe and the servers are very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. As for the decor, it's your typical low-budget restaurant feel: pink booths, artificial flowers and Thai tchotchies everywhere. Charming and comfortable but not fancy by any stretch of the imagination.  There's an extensive vegetarian menu, and I've been told that their veggie dishes are all cooked separately from the meaty ones (separate oils for the fried items etc.). Everything I've had here has been delicious, but I especially liked the tofu skewers w/peanut sauce and the panang curry.  Give Komol a try. You won't be disappointed.",

When i got the curry the flavor was so good but unbearablely HOT! I really couldnt believe this was a medium, i have ordered HOT before from Thai restaurants and it wasent even half the spicyness of this. It was really hard to eat the whole dish because of the hotness. i highly suggest you get mild when ordereing if not it will take away the flavor from the dish",

My husband had no problem eating a good deal of it, though. The coconut milk curry was great. We also ordered the mango with sticky rice dessert, as well as the fried banana with homemade coconut ice cream. The ice cream is to die for. best I've had in a while-- and homemade! :)  Mango sticky rice was wonderful, too, and I haven';t found many places that make it with coconut milk only instead of sweetened condensed milk.

This place finally got a good review out of her. I'm easy to please but I will admit I do taste a huge difference from place to place and I wondered why. Now I know. Alot of places \"Americanize\" and stream line for easier production. Not naming names \"cough cough Pingkaow\" but some places actually use Ketchup in place of tamarind in pad Thai. Large menu with authentic Thai staples other places don't offer. I find it crazy some places don't offer Nam-sod with crispy rice. Clean restaurant despite location. Prices are fair and portions are just right. If you're in the mood for Thai and you're just visiting, it's 10 minutes off the strip. You won't regret it.",

Komol is in a sketchy looking shopping center off the beaten path but don't be scurred, the place is clean, the wait staff is super friendly, and the food is fantastic. A must stop next time you're in Vegas gambling your hard earned cash!",

The vegetarian selection is one of the largest in the city, and they have a wide variety of mock foods, such as mock duck, fish, pork, chicken, and beef. Having such a large selection of menu items to choose from means a lot to me, and the fact that they are extremely tasty and well-prepared dishes means that this restaurant has earned itself a loyal customer for life.  Overall, the food is delicious and I love the atmosphere. They've been in the process of over-hauling the decor, so it looks better and better every time I go there. I enjoy taking friends and family to Komol, because I know we'll get a great vegetarian meal and friendly service each time.",

They can turn up the heat too! 8 star was just right heat for me. 10 star was really hot! Tom kha is quite good. Orange Tofu was phenomenal with crispy exterior and soft inside. We got it 10* and it was sweet and spicy at same time. Herbal Salad is a unique salad I've never found at any other Thai restaurant. It has green apples, cashews and variety of herbs and spices. Got it 8* and it was a taste explosion in every bite! I've never seen Tofu Satay elsewhere and it's very good with delicious peanut dipping sauce. Dishes found everywhere such as vegetable panang and Tofu chili mint were good but not exceptional. My Tip: Try vegetarian dishes here that you can't find anywhere else- they are exceptional.",

We missed the fireworks :( We had to hunt down the waitress to take our orders or bring the check. The check never came, we went to the front desk to pay. Perhaps they did not have their regular folks working that night.  The food, which took so long to prepare, came out with extreme spiciness, while we all requested medium. I did not have patience anymore, we left.   Location for the restaurant was creepy as well.   We went there after seeing 5 star reviews on yelp and were horribly disappointing. Either is was a bad day for the restaurant or these reviews are all fake. Never going back, I've seen better.",

They have an extensive menu, cater to vegetarians, and you get more than what you paid for!   Worth a try: Thai beef salad - lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cuts of beef with a spicy/sweet/sour dressing that plays around in your mouth.   Chicken pad thai - noodles, bean sprouts, and more than enough chicken! Usually when I get this, I finish all the noodles before the chicken. That's when you know it's a lot! And they don't use that weird oily orange sauce I've seen at other restaurants. It's my favorite dish to get!    Panang curry - I was never a fan of curry until I tried this. The coconut curry taste isn't overpowering and they add just enough spice to compliment the other flavors. (I love taking the panang curry sauce and putting it over my pad thai noodles, a little unorthodox, but it tastes amazing!)  Thai tea is also pretty legit. It doesn't taste powder and it comes in a tall, slender glass with cream layered on the top. It's a tasty treat before you get your food.   *lunch is from 11-2:30 and it comes with soup/salad and egg rolls. The amount of food is definitely NOT lunch sized, I had plenty of food left to take home.  *if you're ever trying to cut carbs, try the papaya pad thai! It's almost like the real thing! Papaya is used in place of the noodles and it is great! I could barely tell the difference!   *their spice level isn't really up to Thai standards... I usually get their dishes around a 7-9 and I don't even break a sweat (and my spice tolerance isn't that high). So if you can take the heat, go for a 10!",

Although I've yet to dine at Lotus, I can't imagine it could be worth such a wait when Komol is as tasty as it is and trumps all the Thai I've had all over town.",

    "text": "Great food -- truly spicy if you want it (many other Thai restaurants are afraid to make it spicy because they're worried us gringos can't handle it).  One of the pleasant surprises was that the person who answered the phone & took my order-to-go information spoke perfect English, which reassured me that my order would be understood over the phone.   Now, the location is... both fascinating & creepy.   I was there at about 4:30PM on a Saturday, and the massive strip-mall was mostly devoid of life, save for a few areas.  Made sense once I saw that many of the strip mall storefronts looked abandoned.   Entering the mall area off of Charleston Ave, Komol is on the far side, and strangely, it's right next door to another Thai (/Chinese) restaurant!    If you're the type that gets nervous in 'ghetto' areas, you'll certainly want to avoid Komol at night.   As for me, I am extremely curious as to what that mall looks like at night.    The food was good, but I get Thai food a couple times a month & am continuing to try new places to find one that really stands out above the rest.   I certainly will be happy to order from Komol again if I'm in the area & wanting Thai food, but in terms of flavor & value, the items that I had didn't stand-out above most other Thai restaurants in the LV & Henderson areas that I've tried.",

Love it cause it has the authentic taste. Also, ordered this fried corn appetizer but wasn't as tasty so I ordered another dish. Got their saute Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce instead. That was great, cause I finished the whole dish. When I asked for the bill, I told them I didn't really liked the corn appetizer so they didn't charge me for that dish! That's awesome, I don't usually complain about the food but what they did, I really appreciated it!! So we gave them a little bit more than 20% tip just for the service! Will definitely go again if we are in town!   Bf was happy with the service and food too! He's happy, I'm happy, we're all happy!",

We started off with fried veggie spring rolls - they were good but a bit too greasy compared to the ones I've had in other Thai restaurants.  I wanted to try their meekrob but they were out.  Julie got the vegetarian padkeemao (drunken noodles) and I got the same thing but with pork instead of veggies.  I normally get spicy 5/10 since I don't like burning my mouth but I think I could've gone up to a 7/10 with the noodles.  We got beef panang spicy 10/10 - it wasn't that spicy at all.  We also got pineapple fried rice. It has tomatoes, pineapple chunks and cashews - it was alright but I'm not a fan of rice or sweet rice unless it's dessert.  Service was ok. The interior could be improved.  The food, overall, was average.    But wait, the best thing on their menu  is the dessert!  They have mangoes with sticky rice but they had me at NON-DAIRY ICE CREAM!  I got the Thai tea ice cream which was the main reason I wanted to go here in the first place.  I was not disappointed.  One of the best frozen treats I've ever had.  Yum!",

    "text": "New favorite Thai spot!  They have a huge menu (like, literally HUGE - it's made of big, wooden boards) which has a little bit of everything, including several soups and veggie options -- Actually, I would say roughly 60% of the menu is vegetarian/vegan, which is awesome! I love discovering new places that cater to everyone. To be honest, it is kinda pricy, but it's so worth it. There's just so many things to choose from!   Made reservations as a party of 9 for a friend's birthday. Unfortunately, I was a dumbass and had eaten elsewhere not too long beforehand, so I simply went with an $8 pot of hot sake (which is about 6-7 shots) & a plate of fried eggplant -- But don't get me wrong, I def ended up doing a little scavenging off of others' plates: Tom Kha soup w/ scallops, chicken satay, mango sorbet, soft shell crab, and of course the fried eggplant... All of which were DIVINE! Next time, I'll bring an extra stomach and try something new.  The restaurant itself is a hidden gem. It shares a parking lot with another favorite of mine, Cornish Pasty Co., as well as the infamous Green Door. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the interior decor is precious. Lots a bright, faux flowers and and gorgeous, wooden tables creates a cozy atmosphere. There isn't a whole lot of elbow room, but I think that just adds to appeal. It's a great place for an intimate dinner with your loved ones. Also, the bathrooms are tucked-away and tidy - which is always a plus.  On top of all that, service was spectacular! I can't remember their names off the top of my head, but the two women serving us were friendly, quick, and attentive. They really made it an awesome experience. Thank you! I'll be back soon!",

I thought Vegas' thai food wouldn't be able to live up to SF, but Komol proved me wrong.  Location: It was actually kind of hard for us to find this place. We had to ask the guy where it was. It's in the middle area of the shopping center next to the korean restaurants.   Atmosphere: Everything about his place is great. The menus are wooden and different from what you expect. My friend said, \"These remind me of Jumanji.\" I thought they looked awesome.   Food  Pad se ew: These were pretty good. I didn't think they were amazing, but they definitely satisfied the craving I had. They were a little drier and a little less flavorful than what I'm used to, but they were still delicious.  Thai iced coffee: YUM! If you're feeling a little tired, you definitely need to give this one a try!  Panang Curry: This was the star of the night. We got medium spice and it was perfect! This curry is addicting. Once you start eating it, you definitely won't want to stop.   Service: The waiters were very attentive. I never had to ask for a refill on my water (big plus) and they continuously asked if we needed something, but not too much that it got annoying. It was helpful when they needed to check up on us, especially when my friend was ready for dessert.",

We used to go to Komol once a week and it is still one of our top Thai places. I would come here more often if it wasn't so out of the way but definitely come check this place out if you're in the area ;]]]   We always get: -Shrimp Noodle Soup: It's a clean broth with lots of shrimp.. I like to add a bunch of those pickled jalapenos and the juice it's in to give the soup a kick and I love tangy things. -Spicy Chicken with Bamboo: I don't know if that's what it is really called but that pretty much sums it up HAHA  -Mint Chicken: Minced chicken sauteed with mint and different spices  -Panang Curry: Perfect balance of spice, sweetness & creaminess -Chicken Laap-Kai Salad or Larb: Yummm and so refreshing  I know there are lots of Thai places to check out even Lotus of Siam that is literally just steps away from Komol.. But Komol has been around for so long and is owned by the same family from years ago.. Service is always friendly and the food is always fresh.   HOT TIP: They don't use MSG and can make any dish vegetarian (using tofu, soy chicken, beef, shrimp, duck, fish..fake meat lol) ~!!!",

I happened to be on a date there and was sat in that spot. AND on multiple occasions have seen awkward couples seated there as well. The nice thing about that seat is that if you want to see the entire Restaurant you are in luck, OR if you only want to stare at your potential life partner/pal/lover/romantic interest you are SET, AND have quick access to the toilet if they make off color remarks that offend your delicate sensibilities.   2. Don't eat here if you are in a hurry. The food is amazing however the kitchen likes to take their time making your delicious treats.   3. ALWAYS ask for it as hot as they will make it. They add fresh green chills to your dish if you ask for the hottest of the hot, and they are not only delicious, they are flavorful, crunchy, and HOT. -yum-   4. IF you order the Sukiyaki (a favorite of mine) make sure you specify that you want it as the soup. ALSO don't expect the fish balls that they advertise... I've never had them in my soup.   5. YOU WILL leave full   Yum... I just ate here last night and found another new favorite dish... I can't remember the name though, so sorry! It's a beef/potato curry and it's sweet, hot, savory, and makes me want to go there again tonight...   ...if I only had a date...",

    "text": "Definitely never coming back. My buddies and I went the other day.  We ordered a variety of things thinking it would be a decent place to eat.  We were wrong! $80 wrong between us! Don't waste your money here!  Stuffed chicken wings - very salty stuffing, not stuffed very well, lots of oil seeped inside, but despite that the insides still wasn't cooked.  Pad-Zee-Euw: the gravy tasted like flour and water and cornstarch.  Very cornstarchy made it gross.  Combination Fried Rice: how the pho can you mess this up. i understand it's traditional to use left over rice for home made fried rice, but for them to use rice that has hardened from air exposure, that's just gross.  The vegetables seemed like an afterthought because they were still frozen.    Beef Noodle Soup: this is NOT beef noodle soup!  If this is your first time trying it, you'll think beef noodle soup is gross.  If you're an expert like me, you'll know they're ripping you off.  First off they just threw in 4 small pieces of beef into hot water with the spices from a packet of ramen and called it beef noodle.  Know how i know it's a spice packet from a bag of ramen?  Because the green onion wasn't fresh, it was the dry type, plus it tasted like ramen from a 20 cent ramen bag.    Beef larb: very bitter, the same bitterness as when you squeeze lime into the larb and leave it overnight in the refrigerator and the lime now tastes bitter.  It was obvious that's what they did because parts of it was hot and parts of it was near frozen.",

I loved the humongous variety of foods on the menu and the quick and efficient service.  I even liked the often cheesy decor. I thought that this place worked as a whole--atmosphere, location, service and food. Everything was as good as it gets.  I am very glad that my friend BizBeth recommended this place to me and took me here for lunch--I thought that my search for a perfect Thai place in Vegas was ended by Pin Kaow, but I was proven wrong by this amazing \"old Vegas\" gem.  I liked all the soups, dishes and even meats that I tried here, and servers were very happy to answer my questions and to serve with outmost courtesy.   I LOVED all the vegetarian offerings! I LOVED the inexpensive pricing!  I just hope that my next trip here is as good as my first!",

Bad art, bad decor, Commercial Center... those would not be things that would draw me into a place. The service is impeccable and the food is awesome. My friend lived in Thailand during all of her high school years so if she says it's the real thing, then it's the real thing.   I had the papaya salad which was truly excellent. When he asked me for my \"spicy\" level, I said medium. Both he and my friend looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears (sound familiar), and he responded with oh no, give me a number from 1-10. So, I asked for a 3. Well, it wasn't quite spicy enough for me so I added a little of my own.   I have noticed in Thai restaurants, that most of them think we can't handle the level of heat they can. Well that may be True because it can be too hot for me but I think I could have handled at least a 5. No worries because the papaya salad was excellent.   If you can get past the bad art, the bad decor, and bad everything else here (that does not include the food or the service), then I highly recommend you try this place. You won't regret it.",

I commend them for offering menu items there were not Vegan.  I'm all in for having my food prepared with meat, seafood or poultry. For me, they didnt't bring it with the flavor but would substitute with heat.    When I compared the two, I ordered the same items from the menu. The Garlics Prawns were cooked in a garlic sauce & really shrimpy (small). The rice was OK, and didn't have any flavor. I would go back again if there were no seats available @ neighboring Lotus where I know I will enjoy my meal & not simply eat because I'm hungry.  However, when your order is taken you know they take pride in their service as well as the menu.",

I think we may have only been the non-locals in the joint (a good sign).   I twisted my friend's arm to get the Tom Kha Gai soup. Although it was very oily, it was delicious. Very spicy, but oh so tasty. She twisted my arm to get the fried (!!) spinach. It, too was great.  For our shared entree, we got Papaya Pad Thai. Unfortunately, it was not very good at all.  I think there was only waitress for the whole place and the owner (??) came and helped as well. We were in no hurry and took a very long time with our dinner, so the service that would be considered bad by some, was just perfect for us.   I'd go back if I'm off the strip again. But I wouldn't go if I were in a hurry and I wouldn't order the Pad Thai. I'd risk getting the Tom Kha again, though!",

Homeless folks asking for change, ladies selling their \"goods\", shady figures under awnings of defunct businesses, and the Green Door looming at everything from its distant side of the area.  I'd love to add the sweet transsexuals (please tell me you get the reference?) outside Ramrod to the list, but it's gone!  Never you fear, once you brave the environment and make it to sometimes hard-to-spot entrance of Komol, you're safe.  The decor is wonderfully cheesy, but I really think that adds to the experience.  The menu is huge, but don't be intimidated!  Carnivores, please refer to the first half.  Veggheads, the second half is all for you.    My favorite dishes are the Indian yellow curry, extra thick, both with chicken or tofu, the shrimp pad thai, orange gluten (so wonderfully deep fried and covered in highly sugared sauce!), vegetable chow mien, brown rice, and the fried bean curd appetizer.  My guy likes the green chicken curry.  I also love the iced thai teas they serve there with coconut milk.  The service is very slow, though.  You're seated, ten minutes later your order is taken, thirty minutes later you receive your appetizer, ten minutes later the main dish comes out, and you might get one refill on the glass.  Probably the best thing about this place is the option to tell them how spicy you like it.  I always ask for my curries to be medium-hot, while the guy likes his super mild.  Very rarely are we displeased with the spicedatude of our food.    Caution: medium-hot at Komol does not correlate with spicedatude of Ortega or Pace salsas.  The guy has cried after tasting my curry.  Spicedatude definitions are also prone to change with the chef.  His mild may bring steam to your ears.",

I spent 10 minutes trying to figure this out. The area is obviously one of the older areas of Las Vegas when it comes to strip malls, so you're going to be put off at first on location.   Once you get inside, the scenery is a little more appealing than what's outside. Came for lunch, there was barely anyone there and we got seated fast. The menus are made out of wood, and is huge! There's a number of items you can choose from, and there are meat dishes for those who aren't part of the vegetarian/vegan lifestyle. We ordered the fried egg rolls, which were a little smaller than expected. I felt for the time we were there with barely any people there, our food took longer than expected to arrive, but I figured in preparation it was well worth the wait.  We ordered the orange tofu, vegetarian pad thai, and a vegetable rice dish our server suggested to try. Everything was outstanding, and there were so much leftovers my friend and I both left with a full box for takeout! Service was great, my water was constantly refilled and the server was kind to answer any questions about the menu.  Eager to return to try more vegetarian/vegan options out. Komol truly gives the definition of a great hole in the wall restaurant in Vegas.",

    "text": "Shoutout to Lisa L and Eric R for dragging my husband and I to this place (and bringing a killer coupon no less). I had always been scared of this place due to all the vegetarian verbage that gets thrown around. Luckily their meat dishes are outstanding as well!   Lisa L's description of the food was spot on. Everthing was quite tasty. Service was pretty spotty, but no major complaints there. Beer was reasonable and varied ($4 for chinese/thai imports, $3.50 for American beers) and overall the dinner was an insane value. With the coupon we spent $12.50 each for our 4 course meal + dessert + drinks. Without the coupon we still would have spent a meager $18.50 (with tax and tip!) each for that feast. Killer.   Now for a little comparison amongst Komol and LOS for the die hard foodies who can't decide which to go to (Pin Kao doesn't come close to measuring up to either one!).  Got Vegan/Veggie people with you? Definitely Komol, no question Value oriented? Komol Looking to eat the basics (ie curry, pad see ew, etc): Komol  So why should anyone ever go to LOS? LOS is really for a more sophisticated palate. The food is infinitely more interesting ! The drunken seabass noodles (not found at Komol) and the soft shell prawns (not found at Komol) are my two favorites. Komol was great, but comparing LOS and Komol is kind of ridiculous. It's like comparing Mon Ami Gabi to Joel Robuchon. Both are French, but the food is just so completely different.   Honestly it just depends if you're looking to try Thai like you've never had it, or are you looking for the basics done well at a great price. Komol serves the later.",

    "text": "Before going to Komol Restaurant my level of expectation is quite high for the food and service.Why? Because it is highly rated restaurant and is recognised by The Las Vegas Weekly for one of the \"Best Thai Cuisine\" However, once I've tried I was quite disappointed with the restaurant food and service.  First of all I have to say the restaurant has great selection of non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes.The parking was very convenient.Their food display and garnishes were quite beautiful.The wooden carved menu was kind of pretty.The down side wss the location since it is located in an old complex(Commercial Centre) Anyway,my friends and I wasn't there to try their vegetarian menu.We were there to try the regular non-vegetarian dishes.  Food  First,my friend started with Nua-Dad-Deaw(Beef Jerky) and Fish Cake, I order Pad-Kee-Mao seafood(Stirred-fried flat rice noodles with Garlic,Chilli and Basil leaves), and other friend of mine ordered Beef Musaman.We had been waiting for a long time for our food to come even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all that night. We were extremely hungry. When our appetisers arrived we were quite excited with the food displays and they looked enticing.Once my friend bit on the beef jerky,she said it was quite chewy so I tried.It was quite disappointed since the beef  was quite tough like my friend mentioned and it was not that flavourful,but sweet. Then I tried the fish cake,I thought it was a bit better than the jerky.The fish cake did satisfied my palate,but it didn't taste or look like the typical&traditional fish cake at all.  When my Pad-Kee-Maw Seafood arrived it is way too oily.I know that stirred-fried noodles supposed to be oily but not that oily like this restaurant made..Anyway,it tasted kind of ok.I think it will be more delicious if the restaurant didn't make it so oily. The last dish was Beef Mussaman however we get the vegetarian version instead of Beef Mussaman that we've ordered.So my friend asked our waitress to take it back and fixed it in a polite a manner,the waitress was silent and had no response.She just pulled a face,lifted the dish up and walked away. We had been waiting for our Mussaman Beef to come,but the restaurant didn't fix it for us and our Mussaman Beef never come back to us. So we have to cancelled it.   Service  Terrible,terrible service!!!.Firstly,I spoke Thai to the waitress there,but she spoke English back to me which I found it was very rude of her to do so(I am Thai and she is Thai ) Secondly, the waitresses weren't attentive.They didn't ask us whether \"is everything alright\" They just walked pass our table a lot of time without asking anything.Either me or my friend had to call or grab them whenever we want more water or in need of something.  Overall  I don't know about other customers ,but my  friends and I didn't have a good experience when I visited this restaurant.The service was unexpectedly bad and the food were not that great. I found the service were unfriendly and inattentive.Common! for a the price that we paid,the products and service should have been better.We ended up paying more than $60 dollars and still hungry.I am not quite sure for the future return to Komol Restaurant.Like I said I have been to lots of Thai restaurants,some good some bad,but I would say Komol is one of the worst ones for both and service.Even though I perfectly understand that some Thai restaurants in the USA do not cook authentic Thai dishes,but how about the service???I am extremely surprised that this restaurant get a good review and 4 star rating.According to my experience it is worthed only 2 stars.",

I'm not sure why it is called that because I couldn't detect any mint. I asked for hot sauce because my dining companion didn't want it too spicy. They gave a trio of condiments to add extra heat.  They weren't packing much heat at all.  I had spicier crushed pepper from a pizza joint.   They do offer many mouth-watering sounding items on the menu, but a few of the dishes that Yelpers noted fell flat for me.   I live in NY/NJ area where there are a ton of Thai restaurants and there are several stellar places here.  This place didn't quite measure up.",

We went there for lunch, it was packed and we got seated at a long table where other people were seated a few seats down at the same table. Like a school lunch situation. They kept forgetting about us. It took forever to order our food and the people seated long after us got their food first. We inquired about our food and were told it's coming. Then a waitress came by and told us they were out of Indian curry and asked what else we wanted. 45 minutes in and they are just now telling us that they haven't even started our lunch!!!! Hungry and outraged we left. It should be noted that the table next to us got up and left without receiving thier food bc it took so long and they had to get back to work. I would never recommend this place. Avoid it if you can.",

The day before we ate dinner at Mario Batali's 'Otto Enoteca Pizzeria' in the Venetian but as good as that was, Komol was the place that we talked about after we left Vegas.  We got a bowl of the Tom Yum Mushroom soup for an appetizer and two entrees, Chili Mint Tofu and the Vegetarian Panang.  They all tasted fresh and very flavorful.  It definitely hit the spot for what were were looking for.  This is going to be a regular stop for us every time we come to Vegas.  The shopping complex is easy to find but once you're inside it's hard to find the restaurant.  After driving the perimeter of the complex we found that it's located in the building in the very middle of the complex and facing the strip.  Just an FYI.",

The servers are very nice and accommodating, and they will even adapt non-vegan menu items, such as making Thai iced coffee/tea with coconut milk or making the nam sod with tofu instead of pork.  The herbal salad, tofu nam sod, pad kee mao, panang curry, and tom kha soup are probably my favorite dishes. They even have vegan coconut ice cream!  Good lunch special (M-F) with salad or soup (go for the salad - both the peanut and ginger dressings are great), an eggroll, and a good-sized entree for ~$8.  They tend to make things pretty hot here, so order accordingly.   @shanti - they recently did some remodeling and now the bathrooms (which admittedly, were pretty awful) are now quite nice.",

The food was hot and absolutely delicious.. unfortunately, we're never gonna like thai food anywhere else now.. :(   Being a vegetarian, this place was like heaven, i never have so many options to choose from, but here i did... and seriously, the food was amazing.

I was more than surprised when I walked in, to find this place extremely clean and well decorated.  The servers were definitely nice, I get the \"homey\" feeling right off the bat. I'd give this place more of a 3.5, just because the people were definitely nice to me and we were able to order within the first 5 mins we sat.     The menu was a huge selection, but the prices made my eyes grow extremely big.  I was shocked out how expensive some of the dishes were.  After flipping through the hard book, I made a decision to go with Roast Duck Curry and Garlic Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  My friend with the duck noodle soup.  Roast Duck Curry - It was a little bland.  I didn't taste anything, I thought I'd taste sweetness considering there were pineapples in it.  I didn't know what exactly I was tasting, but it tasted like a Thai herb.    Garlic Salt and Pepper Shrimp - To my disappointment, I thought it'd be deep fried in a batter mix then coated with the garlic salt and pepper mix.  Despite my thoughts, I thought this dish was the winner.  It was stir fried in the garlic salt mix to perfection, except for the fact I had about 10 pieces maybe less and I was paying almost I think 15? I don't know exactly, but it was expensive.    I couldn't speak for the duck noodle soup, since I didn't have a taste. But from what my friend told me,he said it was good.  I don't know if I would return here.  The prices kind of scared me, and the food didn't capture me.  But come out and try it for yourself. Maybe I was just trying the wrong dishes.",

There were no green onions or peanuts in the dish even though it was described to have both on the menu.    They also never checked on out table while we waited for the food.

Finding the place was a little confusing. It seems to been a small mall sort of thing and I am pretty sure I drove around the whole thing until I found it. The only slight problem was the service. It seemed to take a bit longer than it should have and we asked for a few things and never received them. It was nothing that would stop me from going back there again.",

We walked in around 6:30pm and got seated right away. Everyone was friendly and said hello. I looked over the menu while they brought us water and was delighted to see all the different choices they had. I already knew in my head what I was craving, my normal pad-see-ew, but had to look on to see whatelse they had to offer. so many veggie options that I think I need to return and sample some soon! I ordered a glass of the house red wine and that was only $5.95. Filled to the top and def helped to clear my head and calm my nerves. I ordered like I said the pad-see-ew and was pleased with my choice. instead of meat I got the veggie option and asked the waiter what other veggies they add in besides the broccoli that normally comes with it (in the meat and veggie way.) He said they didn't really add others, but he could for me if I wanted. I told him that was okay just to add more broccoli. (i love my greens!) My plate came out with chinese and american broccoli so I was pleased over that. The black bean soy sauce was made just right and the noodles very wobbley like i like em! My boyfriend and I shared the orange chicken with sticky white rice. It was the best orange chicken I have had. Each piece so crispy and full of flavor. My tastebuds were in heaven. The sticky white rice is just as it says. very sticky too. some of the best I have had as well. My boyfriend ordered his usual pad thai set at a spice number 5. medium. When it arrived I was surprised with how spicy it was. For a 5 it was making my nose run and my mouth wanted some milk and I'm a girl who can handle her hot sauces and chili peppers! I am excited to go back and try a new dish I have never ventured into in the world of thai. The service was lovely and the prices were great. For all 3 dishes, a glass of red house wine, and a thai tea I believe it came to 41 dollars. We sure didn't break the bank, but we did make out with leftovers for days! Thank you Dan T. for surprising me with this little (a little hidden) golden dinner date.",

The sauce is thicker than most other curries I've had and I like the way the sauce coats the vegetables and tofu. The dish was creamy, spicy, hot, thick, colorful and . . .delicious.  I especially like the wait staff. Our waiter was very helpful in recommending the Panang dish and he called in the service of his brother to deliberate together to give us the best directions to the airport. The lack of any TVs is also very much appreciated. Thank you Komol.",

I alerted the staff the first time and they said they would take care of it. I didn't go back for a while. When my father was in town and staying nearby, he wanted to go to a good vegetarian restaurant. I decided to give them a try again (hoping the issue was resolved). After we finished our meal, my father pointed out a roach crawling by. =( That doesn't work for me. Please note, this happened June 2014. I haven't been back since. I hope they have solved the issue, but you might want to look around before you chow down.",

    "text": "Pretty bummed to report that Komol has truly fallen from its ranks.  I hadn't eaten here since before it got shut down for a roach infestation.  After they reopened I was very hesitant on returning.  I was in the area the other day and decided to give it a shot.  I have to admit I was looking around for roaches when I was inside. I didn't see any, but the interior was dusty and everything had kind of a greasy layer of film on it. There was only one other table occupied, so I was seated pretty quickly.  The waitress was kind and pleasant, and I ordered veggie panang.  When my starter salad came out the lettuce looked a little bit wilted, and it was room temperature versus cold. I decided to eat it anyways. Two bites in and I got a huge mouth full of dirt. I spit the lettuce out and sure enough under the dressing-all over it was dirt. It had not been washed at all!  The waitress came by to see how things were going and I told her about the dirty salad. She lifted up the plate and saw what I was talking about, apologized, and took it back to the kitchen. She brought out veggie soup for me. It was very bland.  Next came my veggie panang. The rice tasted old, and the veggies were not cooked long enough-the eggplant was quite tough. The flavor of the Penang curry itself was bland and oily. I was so disappointed! I ate about half of it, just because I was so hungry.  But I will surely never return to Komol  again. And to think, once upon a time this was my go to Thai in Vegas.",

Someone comes after few mins asking us if that was all the order we wanted to place! Pretty rude! When the food arrive, it is super cold!

It makes is so easy to chose the right thing without having to make adjustments. Ambience is nice. They do tend to get busy over the weekends so make a reservation. We went on a Thursday night recently and didn't have to wait. Customer service is good for the most part. If you go on a busy night they do make you wait quite a while.   Food was good. Average! We ordered Vegetarian pad kee mow and vegetable fried rice with fried tofu. They have a 5 spice levels and I went with medium. I could have gone a little up since it wasn't that spicy. I asked for the red chili sauce and that made the whole difference. Its pretty reasonable pricing with good portion size. I have had better thai food in LA and Sf, hence the 3 stars.   Parking is pretty easy to find. While in vegas, I guess next time I have to try Lotus of Sian next door!",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday dinner last night and enjoyed the experience. It seems like the more casual version of both Lotus of Siam and Arawan next door. It's a small space but decorated nicely. The menus are ridiculously large in both size (they're wooden) and content. They have a separate set of vegetarian pages in the back but most of them are the same dishes as the front with vegetarian meats. Seems like they could consolidate this a bit.   First off let me say we over-ordered for three people. But it was really fun trying everything. To start we shared a bowl of tom kha soup with shrimp and the herbal salad. The soup was the best tom kha I've ever had. I usually prefer tom yum because it's not as thick and milky but this tom kha was thinner and full of flavor. I'm going to be craving this soup a lot this winter. The herbal salad was a surprise, also full of flavor. It reminded me a bit of a papaya salad but it was crunchy with cashews and onions. The texture of the tofu was awesome. Very porous and crispy. This is a great starter but if I had to cut down on the ordering the tom kha would win over the salad.   For dinner we shared the chicken panang curry, house special duck and chicken pad kee mao. The curry was the best. We ordered a spicy level 7 and it was just enough heat. The sauce wasn't too thick or runny and they give you a good curry-to-rice ratio. The pad kee mao was delicious (huge portion) and the only disappointment was the house special duck. The duck came in a sauce the same consistency as a Chinese sweet and sour.. very gelatinous. The vegetables also felt like a Chinese stir fry: baby corn, snow peas, crinkle cut carrots. The duck was not crispy anymore due to sitting in the sauce so we hardly touched this dish. If something is called \"house special\" it should be a little more special than this. My only other complaint of Komol is the service. After receiving our food our waitress came back once to refill waters and never returned even though we were there for probably an hour and a half. I'm still a fan of the food though and would return for an intimate dinner that doesn't break the bank like Arawan and Lotus may.",

They let you choose your spicy heat index and prep everything fresh. I'm updating my review now that I've traveled in Thailand because I feel even more happy with this great little gem of a restaurant. It is truly reflective of the foods I ate while I was there. My favorite soup is the Tom Ka with seafood combination. It has a nice coconut milk base with squid, shrimp and chicken added to the lemongrass heaven of a dish.  For my favorite meals I always order them 8/10 on the spice level because I love spicy. For noodle lovers, I recommend the Pad Kee Mow with Shrimp. It's garlicky and prepped with fresh multicolored bell peppers. When I'm in a beefy mood I get the Chili Mint Beef. It is very robust and comes with fresh rice. Their Penang Curry with chicken is so delicate and delicious for those who love a great curry.  There just isn't a dish that I've not liked.",

Grabbed Thai iced team and sat back. The highlight was definitely the duck noodles, it came with Bean sprouts onions and a rack of spicy seasonings. The rich dark broth was amazing, it tasted of stewed bones and soy, and with the chilies and pieces of stewed fatty duck, it was a complex combination of savory, fatty, spicy and sour. After having the duck Noodles the salad wasn't able to beat it. It was minced pork and crunchy rice with some lettuce.   Overall i would definitely be back for that noodle.

We started with a couple of apps, first up were the fried chicken wings, crispy not greasy, with a tasty dipping sauce.  Then came the grilled meatballs.  They were a bit chewy, but had a spiciness to them I liked.  For our main entrees we got several, Chicken chili mint, which had minced garlic, chill peppers and fresh mint leaves.  This was excellent!  Next we tried the Pad Thai noodle with shrimp, the rice noodle stir fired with egg, bean sprouts, green onions and ground peanuts always one of my favorites.  We also love a good curry and this time we tried the Beef Panang.  We finished off the meal with a  little desert, something that was new for them to serve tonight, Taro ball in coconut cream.  Um good!  Nothing would prevent me from coming back again, this place is excellent all around.  It can be a bit busy, so if you come there maybe a wait, but it's worth it.",

The waiter was surprised and warned us about the spice, but we were sure we could eat it. The food came and it was wonderful and perfectly spicy. Their desserts fried banana with coconut icecream and fried ice cream are a must try.  The Best THAI food I have eaten in the United States... Keep up Komol !!!",

I waited about 40 mins after placing the order for two lunch specials and that was fine.. Given I was extra early! But when I made it home, that's when the devastation hit! I wasn't given a delisicious velvety panang it was a grease bowl.  Man, it was just really greasy and seperated. No spice no flair. The pad thai had no flavor in fact it didn't even have one lick of flavor. Flavorlessnesss....hmmmmm... Oh that's it! The sever never asked me a spice level!!!! My earliness must have frazzled him!   On a high note the peanut butter dressing on the salad was very good as was the soup!! That let's me know this place has great potential!   Moral of the dramatic story! Give people a chance to warm up before going! I don't think I'd given them a ompletely fair shot, so I will return one day to try again.",

They're a little overpriced compared to Thai Pepper which is a few blocks away and taste isn't even close to Lotus of Siam which is on the same shopping center.

They have a very extensive vegetarian menu..way more than regular menu.  Ordered fresh spring rolls, beef panang, chicken chili mint and thai tea ice cream.  At first I ordered mee krob but they were out *crying*  Fresh spring rolls ($4.50): it's just ok. It tastes and looks like meatless vietnamese spring rolls with Thai sweet sauce. Super minty and it freshen your breath  in seconds. 2 stars!!  Beef panang ($9.95): My level 6 spicy has a nice kick. But that's the only good thing.  It is just spicy..the sauce is super thick but I can only taste the chili.  What happen to the curry taste?  I usually eat my curry sauce with rice but not this time.  3 stars and I am being generous.  Chicken chili mint ($9.95): better than panang but it's overly salty. At least this dish is tasty and good.  Too bad they also chopped the cartilage =(  Adding fried egg on top will make this dish better.  3.5 stars  Thai tea ice cream ($3.00): Did someone eat my ice cream already??? The ice cream is so small compared to the picture.  That is so misleading.  It looks like someone uses a super tiny spoon to dig it out.  Small scoops of ice cream.  The flavor is actually not bad.  The flavor is actually there. 3.5 stars <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iA8Ve2sZKN5Vz3mYKrtCaQ?select=BxC-EDAIxbYBg43Sm6dPJw#lfWGlwG7UUDMJwPQX0-TEg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/iA8V...</a>  The service is friendly and attentive.    I guess I am spoiled with Thai food in Los Angeles..especially Hollywood.  This place is popular though because it's packed!!!!  3 stars!!  Maybe the vegetarian dishes are better.

    "text": "Honestly I would expect more out of such a highly rated restaurant AND a Zagat restaurant as well. I think the night we came was jinxed or something because my experience here for a friend's birthday was not terribly good.  For starters we had a party of 6, which increased to 7 unexpectedly, but it was fine, we all just squished a bit closer to each other. The restaurant did have a table set up for our reservation when we arrived, so that was a good start. The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxing and the noise level while we were there was perfect. In fact, I think we were probably the loudest out of the whole place.  Service - It was all over the place. We had two people taking our orders and I think that is where things got weird. We had a friend who came, but needed to leave early so she ordered her food before the rest of our part had even arrived AND she ordered it to go. Somehow between our two servers that was turned into \"She wants an order of shrimp chow mein AND an order of shrimp chow mein TO GO\". Luckily we were able to nip this mistake before it actually happened. And although our servers were attentive, the service was S-L-O-W. As in plates of food came out one or two at a time and there was big chunks of wait time in between people's food arriving. It's one of my biggest pet peeves when a restaurant cannot get a whole party's food out in a decent amount of time. Members of our party sat without food for a good 7 to 8 minutes while others were almost halfway through their own plates.   Food - I had the Kang-Ped Delight with Beef (err, actually with 5 pieces of beef). Although it was really good, I did enjoy it, I was missing the beef! The curry was spot on and their rice was sticky yummy. As always I also had a Thai iced tea and theirs is spot on. Creamy and milky, yet refreshing and served in a very cute glass. I also sampled from the \"Combo Appetizer Plate\" that our group got. I had the BBQ pork, very good; and an egg roll - also good, especially dipped in spicy mustard! We all also shared the fried eggplant, which I felt was okay, nothing special. The ice cream served for my friend's birthday was kind of funky, and I felt as though it was freezer burned. Meh.   Overall - Honest to goodness I don't think I'll be coming back. The lackadaisical service to my friend's birthday party was pretty off-putting. Maybe they're just not good with big groups? I have no idea. BUT I can get Thai food at a lot of places in Vegas closer to my house. So, unless I'm *invited* to Komol again I doubt I will return.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been eating at Komol since 1991 and it still keeps making the best Thai dishes ever. I love that when you order HOT it will definitely be HOT so if you don't like spicey go with mild because you can always ask for side spices. Some of their vegetarian dishes are so amazing that you would never even miss having the meat in it. I love the shrimp salad, papaya salad and the herbal salad. All the curries are delishes, the chili mint is to die for, and any of there noodle dishes taste so different and made with love. It's a smaller restaurant so I would recommend reservations, or call at least 40 minutes ahead for take out orders, but well worth the wait and freshness. This restaurant is definitely better than any of the neighboring restaurants regardless of what the buzz around town is. It's all about Komol.",

My wife and I came here and ordered the Vegan Pad Thai, spring rolls, Tom Kha Mushrooms, Rad Na, Herbal Salad, House made Coconut Icecream, plantain banana in coconut milk, and the thai iced tea with coconut cream. I give Komol Thai Restaurant a 4.5 out of a possible 5 stars.  The Vegan Pad Thai, Plantain Banana, and where the restaurant was located were okay. Everything else was amazing! Rad Na was my favorite thai dish before I stopped eating meat, but komol allows me to enjoy it once again. I make sure I order that everytime I go there. I also crave the Herbal salad constantly... I'm craving it now as I type this review... mmm... herbal salad... Tom Kha Mushrooms were crazy good! So creamy, so delicious. Up to this point my wife and I totally forgot that our meal was Vegan.  We also had the Thai Iced Tea. Yep, amazing as well. Komol's homemade coconut icecream was inhaled by my wife. Both my wife and I highly recommend Komol, especially if you are vegan and love thai food.",

    "text": "Lotus of Siam: Best Thai restaurant in N. America?  Well, I haven't tried it, but I would be surprised if it's the best Thai restaurant in their strip mall.  I eat meat.  My girlfriend does not.  Our friend is vegan.  On our way home from Vegas, we had to try Komol.  Upon entering, we noticed the calm and soothing decor.  This is not your standard ethnic, veg-friendly hole-in-the-wall.    After we were seated, we got the 411 from the server.  Now, we have been to Thailand.  It's a great country with friendly people.  If you go, be forewarned that fish sauce comes in everything.  Some places are more accommodating than others.  Armed with this knowledge, we asked the server about the ingredients in the Thai food.  He assured us that the vegetarian food contained no fish or oyster sauce, most of it was vegan, and they even used separate cooking oil and grills for the meat dishes.  The iced coffee contains milled white sugar, which some vegans eschew.  The iced coffee was sweet and very good.  We got lunch specials that included crunchy, tasty spring rolls that came with hot mustard and sweet and sour sauces.  We got vegetable soup that we all enjoyed.  You can request how spicy your entree is, and I like it hot and kicking, so I got the Hot and Spicy Vegetables with red curry.  Thanks to some chili peppers, it was hot and kicking, all right!  My girlfriend got Vegetarian Panang and asked for mock chicken with it.  I'm glad she did because it was delicious.  It was probably hotter than the level of moderate spiciness that she requested.  As usual, we were too full for dessert.  We left very satisfied.  If you don't like this place, you don't like Thai cuisine.  I don't think I've had a better meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "I came here on Saturday night for dinner, and let me tell you it was quite the adventure. We entered in the address in our GPS and had no idea where it was. Finally I told my boyfriend to turn left at the area where it said the restaurant supposedly was and explore the dark plaza that Komol is located at. We were very close to leaving when I spotted a small sign that said \"Komol\".   Upon entering the restaurant, we saw that it was very busy and very crowded (that's a good sign right?!). Despite the busy environment, it only took us about 2 minutes to be seated. Immediately they took our drink order and we spent a few minutes looking over the menu. We decided to order beef pepper steak, ginger chicken, and garlic fried rice with chicken.   The breakdown:  Pepper Steak: The pepper steak came out as a \"family sized\" portion, meaning it was much bigger than we had imagined it would be. The sliced pieces of meat was served in a brown pepper sauce along side chopped strips of red and green peppers and onions. The flavor of the sauce was amazing and tasted great with the rice as well!   Ginger Chicken: The serving of ginger chicken was also what I would consider a \"family sized\" portion, so if you order this be prepared to share! The chicken had just the right amount of ginger flavoring from the sauce it was in. The dish also comes with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.   Garlic Fried Rice w/ Chicken: The garlic fried rice literally made me say \"wow!\" when I tried my first bite. The garlic flavoring was subtle, but enough to create a unique taste for the rice. Once I had my first bite, I just wanted to keep eating more (sadly, it wasn't my order).   The food at Komol is amazing and delicious. Proof of this is that none of the people who accompanied me that night were hungry, but once they had their first bite of the food, they couldn't stop eating! Yes people, it's that good. I definitely will be coming back here to try their other dishes.",

As much as I love vegan food, I was really excited to find a place where I could have choices without my omnivore man feeling left out.   The service was super friendly (but not in that annoyingly cheerful chirpy kind of way), and when I inquired, they let me know that the \"chicken\" had eggs in it but all the other soy meat was vegan.  It had been a busy weekend, and they ran out of soy beef, so I asked for seitan in my Pad See Ew instead. They gave me a choice of regular or Chinese broccoli, so I did half half. When I tasted it I wished I had just gone with the yummy Chinese broccoli. I wasn't a fan of the seitan they used, but overall the dish was ok.  My favorite part of the meal was the Tofu Satay. Yum!!!  He ordered some kind of fish, sweet and sour I think. He said it was fine, but then again he's really not a big fan of Thai food. I topped it all off with a coconut milk Thai iced tea, slightly too sweet (and I do like my tea sweet) but still oh so yummy.   I would go back for seconds.",

We always go during lunch when its near empty and get waited on hand and foot. The waitstaff talks to us like we're friends, not customers.   We always order panang. The panang is, as my friend puts it, \"to die for.\" She gets chicken panang, I get the tofu panang. Either way, all you're really going for is the sauce. One day we'll grow the balls to just ask for panang sauce and a couple straws.   We also order tom yum to start, nam tok (beef salad), and I get my standard green curry and sticky rice. Green curry is my favorite Thai dish ever, but Komol's is pretty lackluster. But everything else is always really good. My friend told me you're supposed to make little balls with the sticky rice and sop up the juices.   The last time I went they were pushing Moonstone Coconut Lemongrass sake. They sell it $7.50 for a half bottle. It tastes mostly like coconut milk + nigori sake. The lemongrass, I caught more aromatically and at the end of the taste. It was really good.   Komol is located in the Commercial Center, sparsely populated with small businesses, including an Asian (Korean) market. I go there for some dessert mochi.  * off the strip, non-casino",

My first attempt on finding this place led to inevitable failure. I went back to the hotel room and researched the area via google maps to realize, that dead looking area has actual stores that are open.  With CES going on only a couple of blocks away (at the LV Hilton) I was surprised to see that it wasn't packed. It certainly wasn't empty but all of the surrounding restaurants during the convention were filling up quickly. I ordered the green curry (via yelp reviews) and boyfriend, the oh so adventurous, got chicken fried rice.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that the reviews weren't kidding, the portion sizes are ridiculous. Even with my enormous appetite, I only polished off half the dish. While some may say that they don't give you enough rice, I think they give you just enough. You don't want to fill up your belly with those carbs, you want to fill it up with that delicious green curry and all of it's creamy glory.  After leaving Vegas, I became obsessed with green curry. Unfortunately, I have yet to find one that is quite as good",

I actually like the unassuming decor as its like a leaf that hides the flower. The pad see ew here is excellent. Definately full flavored and cooked well. The other dishes that shine here are the mint stir fried dishes, the curries and the coconut soup. My friend says that the large vegetarian menu is also very good.

Once inside, we found a small jam packed restaurant and had to wait for about 20 minutes before we were seated. The food was good, but I wasn't extremely impressed. I might be biased because we have amazing thai food in LA. I loved the fact that it wasn't on the strip and the prices were reasonable, and the portions generous. However, the overall quality didn't compete with the Thai food I am used to back home.....",

We wanted to go Little Siam but since they don't serve food after 2:30pm for lunch we ended up here. I still prefer Little Siam but this place was just as good as any other  good Thai food place.  ORDER for 2  Hot & Sour Soup Cup (Excellent) $4 Fried Tofu with Peanut Sauce (Good) $4 Panang Curry Vegetable with Shrimp (Good) $12 Garlic Sauce Talapia (Good) $18  Total $46 with tip & tax.  QUALITY  The food here is really good the Panang curry was really good and had a lot of vegetables in it. They were not over cooked and the sauce was perfect blend of coconut and panang sauce. There were only 3 shrimps in the plate though, although they only charged $2 for the shrimp. The fried Talapia was ordered with their garlic sauce. Tons of garlic. If you don't like whole fishes then don't order this. My significant other cannot handle seeing fish head etc so we asked them to take the head off when serving the fish. I love the skin since it is kind of like eating fried chicken. The fried tofu was also really good for $4, they gave us tons of tofu and the peanut sauce was also really good. The soup was also great.   QUANTITY  Read good sized portions for the price.  SERVICE  Very friendly and kept as informed the whole time what was going on with our food. The appetizer and the soup showed up relatively fast  RETURN BUSINESS  4 sure. But if Little Siam is open it is gonna be a tough call.",

We ordered the coconut sticky rice with mango and the taro balls in coconut cream. 1st of all, coconut sticky rice is MY FAVORITE, and I'm such a food snob about it - this is HANDS DOWN my most FAVORITE, EVER!! The taro balls were SO GOOD too!! The texture/consistency was SO FRESH, and soft, and the whole dish overall, was such good quality ingredients and flavor. The PERFECT amount of sweetness in both desserts. As for the service... It was so refreshing to have such genuinely friendly service. Dutch really seemed interested in our wants and making sure we were well taken care of. Can't wait to come back!!",

The summer rolls were pretty good. The peanut sauce along with the chili vinegar sauce was spot on and complimented the rolls well. ORDER THE CHOW FUN. I love chow fun, and so we ordered it and it was a great dish: I literally can't explain how great it was. The pad thai: I personally love pad thai, but this one was a little greasy.  The reason this got 3 stars was because the service STINKS. We got our drinks, and it took about half an hour to get an appetizer out. Half an hour. It was ridiculous. Also, one of the waitresses had an attitude problem when we asked when and where our food was and when it was coming. We ended up getting everything, altogether, an hour later.

She also gave us free thai iced teas, since they weren't ready right when we ordered them.  The two of us realized we both liked the music that they were playing, so we asked her what it was.  It was a mix, so we asked for any artists, song titles, etc.  She didn't have that info available, so she asked for one of our addresses, and she actually MAILED MY FRIEND A CD.

We for sure would not have stopped in based on exterior curb appeal.  Once you open the door, feel the vibe and smell the cooking, you'll know you're in the right place.  It's small and cozy & clean and has very helpful wait staff. They'll explain all the ingredients you are not familiar with and happily add things in or take things out on your request. And, no MSG in anything! The portion size is quite ample. Plan to take some home for leftovers.   The menu itself is absolutely huge... pages and pages of mouth-watering choices. We had the Herbal Salad - a most delicious concoction of cashews, garlic, onions, basil, apples, carrots, coconut and more. Herbal salad is clearly a must order dish!  And we all loved the Duck Chili Mint...  I recommend that too...  yummmm.    I only wish this place wasn't 1,100 miles away from me so I could eat there more often! A meal at Komol's is definitely on my \"must do in Las Vegas\" trip list from now on!",

The food is yummy, and the menu is huge which is usually intimidating for me, but sometimes it's nice to have options.  A friend turned me on the Herbal Salad which is in the Vegetarian portion of the menu, I like it really spicy,  and also if you're feeling naughty I'd suggest the Vegetarian appetizer combo, everything seems better fried.  The portions are generous and great for sharing, I always end up with some tasty to-go food.   The service is great, and you can tell it's family run because of the pride that they have in their service.    The only apparent drawback is the location but it is also kind of a plus in my opinion.",

I first have to say that I'm not a huge fan of spicy food but came here for a vegetarian UYE and I was leery about how I'd like it without all the spice.  The first item I had was the spring rolls which was suprising plentiful and meant for sharing, the sauce was the a great flavor but the rolls themselves were fresh and rolled tight.  As for my main dish I had the chicken tofu noodles that were amazing, this was my first full foray into vegetarian eating and I left far more full and satisfied than I ever imagined.    I will certainly be coming back and bring more out of town guests.",

I think that's more a reflection of personal preferences vis-a-vis that dish rather than a reflection of restaurant quality.   Not holding it against them for the purposes of this review, and will likely reserve my final judgment until further meals. This review will be revisited once I've made a few more trips here.   I was going to give it a provisional three-star rating but bumped it up to four because their vegetarian and vegan selection is staggering, and their menu on the whole is just as expansive as Lotus of Siam, the legendary Thai spot just across the parking lot.",

The friendly staff quickly greeted my gf and I and seated us in the slightly small restaurant.  The menu covers are made of big slabs of wood.    I got the veggie panang curry, extra spicy.  It was one of the best curries I have ever had.  Very creamy and coconutty, well seasoned, nicely aromatic, not too oily.  The portions are nice and big and so I took some home and it was even better two days later.  My gf got soy orange chicken.  It comes with these strips of 'chicken' about 2-3 inches long by only about 1/8 inch in width (squared).  So basically chicken sticks?  The orange sauce that it comes with is delicious and it isn't slathering the chicken like some places do.  Instead it is more of a subtle glaze that goes great with the crispy little chicken strips.  I will gladly come here every time I am in Vegas and try something new each time.  I'll likely never get to try their desserts though since Luv It is so close by.",

Not a single noodle in the noodle soup, the saltiest panang I've had in my life and the most bland beef and peppers ever made. The service was terrible with appetizers coming out after the entrees 90 minutes after ordering. I was starving which is the only reason I ate anything at all because I feared it would take another eternity if I sent it back. The saving grace was the soup, the mushroom Tom Kha was fantastic. After looking at the reviews, we're not alone in our disappointment and it just sucks because this was a go-to of ours for so long. The hunt for delicious thai continues....",

This flavorful concoction is the Herbal Salad.  I would become vegan if I could eat this every day...for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 5 Yelp Stars just for this dish.   I am so glad that Lotus of Siam had an hour long wait when I stopped by last Saturday because I remembered that Komol was in the same lot and headed over there instead.  And what a blessing because I have found my new favorite dish in the Herbal Salad. The other items that we ordered were also delicious and comparable to other Thai restaurants. I would be happy to order them again: beef green curry, chicken fried rice, and chicken larb. I will probably skip the combination vegetarian appetizer and Lad-Na with pork next time (and there will be a next time). The menu is so extensive that there are other dishes I want to try anyways.  Their menu is no joke, weighing in at 5 pounds.    I can't wait to return. The service was very friendly and attentive.  Although my 3 year old daughter's wish for fried ice cream were crushed because they had run out, she was equally satisfied with a scoop of mango ice cream.",

I found it through yelp and it was such a successful venture that I am a firm believer in its powers haha...Which is why I am passing on the favor of a positive review so others may find it.   And since it's so far from the strip and a few miles from the Freemont Experience, we felt lucky to find it. Our waiter was fantastic and his recommendations were perfect. We had the Herbal Salad, which is \"yelpers\" favorite, as we learned from the waiter. It is incredible! So many flavors with great textures! I just remember the crunch of crisp apples, shredded coconut, lemongrass, and cashew nuts. Wish I could make it at home. Another highlight was the mushroom thom kha spiced up and their own coconut sorbet. Best meal in vegas by far.   Hope you have a chance to get there. Everything was great, the staff are very friendly and so helpful! And in the tradition of Thai cuisine, large portions and great prices for each dish!   Happy eats!",

    "text": "The menu is good here, because they have both vegan/vegetarian options for my friends, and MEAT dishes for us carnivores.   Anyway, the first thing I liked about this place was the menus with cool wood covers. See attached pic.   Then I decided to try the Goong Hom Sabai, aka wonton wrapped shrimp. When the plate arrived it had 6 shrimp and a nice pile of fried onion rings on the plate. I tried one of the shrimp, but was pretty disappointed on how thick and floury the wonton tasted. I didn't eat anymore, because it was just not good. However, the onion rings were delicious!!  The very friendly waiter told me he would take it off my ticket since I didn't eat the shrimp, but I told him he could charge me, since I ate the onion rings and loved them. Of course he took it off anyway.   Next I ordered the Pad-Kee-Mao with pork, even though the menu only says shrimp and chicken.  This was pretty good, but a little less basil would be preferred. I love the big flat noodles and it had a good flavor. I ordered it a 7 on the 1-10 hot scale, and it was just right...even a little nose run at the end of the meal.   Lastly we finished off with some non-dairy coconut ice cream. It was very tasty...glad my friend ordered it.   I will be back here for sure!!",

    "text": "Man, I've eaten here maybe a dozen times and something is always slightly off. Either the flavors are lacking dimension, or the spice is haphazardly hot, or the temperature of the food is just not hot - almost as if they my dish sit for 10 mins or more until the entire party's order is ready to send out. This is so 1950s. I believe hot food should be eaten. If it's cold - hold.  Service here can be less than attentive - our party's water glasses are usually less than half full, and at least half the time either the wrong (white) rice comes out or it takes another 3 or 4 minutes to receive a small bowl to eat out of.  To be fair, the average dish at Komol is superior to the average small/midsize town Thai restaurant. It's the execution that is missing. The plates, glassware, silverware, plastic floral decor, and bathrooms are less than spotless. The vinyl-padded, low booths are a little claustrophobic. Once you're done eating you feel like getting the heck out of there.  It's not *cheap* either - not expensive, but not as good of a value compared to say, Weera Thai or Kinnaree Thai. I do look forward to trying the Pasty shop next door!",

The last two visits the food was overly salty and my boyfriends dish was overly garlicky. When we asked the server to recommend an appetizer we took her advice and got these deep fried shrimp rolls. They were completely tasteless.  This all depresses me but I don't know if I'll ever come back if the quality of the food remains this way.",

This place is in a really discrete location... a place I would never think of turning into, but that's where this place hides its delicious food. I absolutely love Thai food, especially Thai iced tea, and theirs was amazing. Ordered vegetarian spring rolls (twice!), hot green pepper chicken/beef combo level 10 spicy, and fried ice cream for dessert. Everything tasted great, but I will have to order level 20 next time, since 10 wasn't spicy enough for me lol. I will definitely go here again... it's worth the drive from Summerlin.",

    "text": "Usually, you wouldn't want two of the same type of restaurants so close to each other. You normally wouldn't put a Johnny Rockets next to a Fatburger. A Church's next to a Popeye's. However, you have Lotus of Siam in the same parking lot as Komol. Yet, this works out perfectly for Komol. The lines for Lotus are so long, people say screw it and find this place a short walking distance away. It's ingenious.  This was exactly how my last visit went. Lotus of Siam had something like an hour and a half wait. We got put on a waiting list, waited half an hour and said forget it. Went to Komol with some friends. We were seated pretty quickly and got some waters and drinks. It took some time to get our food orders in. There seemed to be only a few servers on duty and Komol was packed with Lotus of Siam overflow.  The problem was waiting. We were on a waiting list that I could check on my phone with. So probably an hour after we had sat down at Komol, I got the notification that our table was ready at Lotus. At this point at Komol, we had just received our appetizer. Seemed to defeat the purpose of choosing another restaurant if the wait was going to be just as long.  When it comes to the food, it didn't blow me away. I believe we ordered each version of the pad thai and it was fine. It's a bit skimpy on the actually meat. However, they did deliver on the spice though. The servers, to their credit, did refill waters often. Probably wasn't hard when you could see my forehead sweating across the joint. It was more of a favor to me than anything.  Overall, it's a perfectly acceptable Thai restaurant. Didn't impress me though and the wait to get food was a bit on the long side.",

They are the originators of \"Thai and Vegetarian\". I remember when no other Thai place would have vegetarian on their menus. I have told all my vegan friends about this place. Sometimes the service can be a little slow when they're really busy, but that's expected.   I have tried other places that are also \"Thai and vegetarian \" like Kinaree,  but nothing's like Komol. Kinaree seems like they took some ideas from Komol because they have very similar items on their menu. Makes you wonder. I'll have to ask people at Komol next time I go there. After going to other Thai places Komol is the only Thai place I recommend!!",

The entrees were both excellent. Tasted so good. The separate order of fried rice was screwed up and when we told this to our waiter he was quick to react and remove it off our bill.   They have a hoard of vegetarian dishes and for once we didn't have to explain our needs to the staff. The reason for four and not five stars is the service was darn slow.

My husband ordered his favorite Northern Thai dish (which was the special of the day) the koa soi. I ordered the chicken panang. As an appetizer we got the fried spring rolls that were sadly really gross. When the waitress brought my chicken panang she apologized they were out of koa soi and so my husband ordered the duck curry.... worst choice! The duck curry had no curry flavoring in the broth it tasted like duck in water. However the chicken panang was pretty good the curry had a good flavor and the chicken was tender. The restaurant was not busy at all which was why it was so disappointing our waitress wasn't very attentive or friendly to us. We were polite and paid for our entire meal even though we couldn't touch the duck curry because it was not good. But we will not be returning here again!",

Dishes start at 6.95 and they come with an eggroll, and soup or salad.   I got the pad thai and my friend got the chicken Panang curry. The eggroll and veggie soup was pretty good. My friend got a salad with the peanut sauce dressing. The peanut dressing was delish!  I love peanut sauce so this won my tastebuds over. My pad thai was very good. The noodles were soft and it had ample sauce. A little too heavy on the green onions but I just picked them out. Would have loved some tofu on the pad thai but it only came with chicken and egg. My friends Panang curry was a little watery. I prefer a thicker curry sauce. I thought it was good but it's not as flavorful as other places such as weera thai.     I would come to this place again because I enjoyed their food and there was no wait!!",

I'm no longer vegetarian, but I still come here for their fake meat, because it's that good.  My absolute favorites are the soy chicken fresh rolls, soy chicken nuggets, and the orange tofu. The fresh rolls are filling In themselves but a serve as a nice light appetizer. If you want more of a heavy appetizer (maybe you're hungover ;), then I definitely suggest the soy chicken nuggets. Finally, the orange tofu is a yummy dish of crispy fried tofu smothered in a not too sweet orange sauce.   If you're not too full (and if they aren't sold out), the mango sticky rice is also a must.",

However, my recent experience at the restuarant really threw me off.  We went on a saturday early evening. After we were seated we were not given a menu and no one came to check on us for 15 minutes. Finally we got the menu after we asked for it. The fried rice (our usual dish) we ordered came burnt and was smelling burnt, so we had to send it back.  This was the first time we ever sent back a dish during all the visits we have been there. Apart from the fried rice problem, other food was good that earned the 2 star rating.  The service was practically non-existent, no one came to check on us anytime. Everytime, we need something we have to take pains to catch hold of someone. It was really horrible service.  I would stay out of Komol at least for a few months. Also from food point of view, unless you are vegetarian, you can always go with nearby local restuarants such as Lotus of Siam or Satay both of them are pretty good so far.  After a few months, I would try some togo's and watch their service before I can take my family back for a dine-in for I dont want to go through that horrible service again.",

The paintings on the walls and other knick-knacks all show a lot of Thai pride, and are set up quite well as to not clutter your dining experience.  I came in with a friend for lunch on a Monday for the lunch specials.  There are many options, and all come with an egg roll, and a soup or salad.  Go with the salad, since the peanut sauce is AMAZING.  Just the right amount of sugar and salt.  The vegetable soup was bland and forgettable.     I ordered the Panang Curry with tofu, my friend got the Indian curry with chicken.  I asked for the Panang extremely spicy, but it came out mild.  The curry was a little chalky, and needed to be cooked a bit longer or needed more water.  The Indian curry was spicy and tasty.    The menu is very large, and I would come back to try a few more items, even though the ones I had were nothing special.    The biggest short coming of this place is the time it takes for your food to get to the table.  It wasn't busy at all, and we still waited a good twenty minutes after our soup/salad arrived.",

They ask you what spice level you like, I tend to love my spices. I think it's the part vietnamese in me. I can't remember what my husband and kids ordered but know that they enjoyed it. I was honestly too absorbed in my bowl of soup. The customer service was wonderful here and we didn't wait too long to receive our food. Definitely will be making this a regular place to visit.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by stating that I am totally unqualified to judge authentic Thai food since I've never been to Thailand, don't know anyone from Thailand, and rarely eat this particular cuisine. However, my niece loves it and it was her birthday, so off we all went to Commercial Center, which is the place to go if you're looking for exotic dining or exotic adult activities. We were thinking about Lotus of Siam, but we had a couple of small kids with us, so we didn't want to jostle with the crowds and picked Komol instead. (The presence of said toddlers also quashed the prospect of sampling any of the other available entertainments, as did the unfortunate way we look naked). Anyway, Komol was pretty full when we arrived, but we were seated right away, and the ambience was both attractive and comfortable. Service was a little slow, but I'm not deducting any stars because they were friendly and working their butts off, and we got everything we ordered, which was a lot. We had: Indian chicken curry, pork chili mint, fried shrimp in wonton wrappers, Thai beef salad, beef pad zee euw (sp?), chicken satay, and Thai beef jerky. Everything was delicious; the peanut sauce for the satay and the dipping sauce for the shrimp (plum, maybe?) were outstanding. Wanted to lick all the plates. Maybe I did. Only questionable thing was the jerky, which tasted fine but I found the texture (dried, deep-fried strips of meat) a little off-putting. Maybe because I kept thinking of that movie where the plane crashes in the Andes and the survivors are starving so they figure out a way to make a tasty snack. You get the picture. We can't all be Andrew Zimmern. Anyway, we were stuffed but still ordered a dessert to share- fried bananas with homemade ice cream.  Funny how there's always room for a little something deep fried. The waiter explained that the ice cream was vegan, which immediately set off alarm bells. I don't even want my vegetables vegan - coat those bad boys in cheese sauce, please! But, it looked like a harmelss ball of pineapple sherbet, so I bravely plowed in, or tried to. It was frozen so hard it would have made a better weapon than dessert, but the kids hacked away happily and finished it all, and it kept them so busy they didn't notice their share of the fried bananas disappearing. All this plus drinks was less than $80 before tax & tip. Not bad. Conclusions: Authentic? Who knows? They looked Asian. Delicious? Absolutely!",

They brought out each of the 3 appetizers (which served 3 each) came out 20 minutes apart. Perhaps they thought everyone was sharing and wanted to space them out, whatevs. The meals began coming out well over an hour after being seated. First wave was 2 orders of pad Thai, followed by a 15 minute wait until 3 orders of curry appeared. They let that chill for another 10 minutes before bringing out the vegan noodles (shared between 2). After 5 minutes we inquired about the final order (go see mee) and they said it took the longest because it was deep fried noodles. 5 more minutes passed before the final order appeared.  Final time from first order to last: 35 minutes.. Some people were done before the last entree was delivered, and no word of acknowledgement of the delay at all.",

    "text": "We have been here several times. There are plenty of reliable Thai options in the area. Komol stands out because it is very reasonably priced, big enough that there is never a long wait to get a table, and there are very good vegetarian options. The heavy wood-bound menus are a nice touch.  Get the Thai iced coffee or tea. Service is ususlly on the slow side, so I  always start with a  Tom Kha or Tom Yum small soup  (good opportunity to go vegetarian even if you go with meat for the entree).  The curries are great for sharing. The noodle dishes are very good. I like that they organize the entrees by type of meat.  Lots of interesting seafood items.  Overall, it's hard to recommend anyone drive across town for the experience, but it's a lot easier to get into than Lotus of Siam, in the same parking lot, and it's a good place to start a night downtown, or near the strip. We usually stop in before we see a show at the Onyx Theater.",

Makes you forget you parked in a weird shopping center, haha.   FOOD: Pad Zee Euw (4 stars): Not like the normal pad see ew's I've had but still probably one of the better dishes I tried from here.   Chili mint chicken (3 stars): Didn't expect it to be ground chicken, so I wasn't too much of a fan. It didn't say ground chicken on the menu, they should really specify.   Steamed sea bass (4 stars): Perfectly cooked fish.   Kung Pao Tofu (1 star): Didn't taste like much.   Mongolian Tofu (1 star): Couldn't really taste any sauce, not flavorful.  Vegetable Delight (3 stars): Probably one of the better vegetarian dishes I tried, still not as much flavor as I was looking for, but more than the other tofu dishes.    Egg fried rice (4 stars): Liked this one too!   Pineapple fried rice (3 stars) : Ehh, liked the egg fried rice better. Tasted a little too sweet.   Yellow Indian Curry (4 stars): Good curry sauce. Not as strong as a usual yellow curry but it was still flavorful.  They also give you white rice with the dishes. I probably would have given it 4 stars if we didn't order any of the tofu dishes. Those were lacking in flavor, but if you're a meat eater you'll have better luck.   SERVICE (5 stars) The waitress we had was super nice and accommodating.",

    "text": "This is an ABSOLUTE must go to if you are vegetarian.  It was just the drive from the southwest that prevented me from coming here sooner.    What a menu!  So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago.   I was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said \"No problem\" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.  The Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits.",

    "text": "Instead of eating in any one of the glitzy spots on the Strip, I decided to look for something off the beaten track.  I got lucky and found Komol.    The commercial center is rather an enigma, viewed from Sahara Avenue.  However, once you enter the inner parking area, you realize that you are surrounded by a mecca of authentic international dining options, Asian, Latin, African, Middle Eastern.  No standard hamburger shops, to be sure.  I chose Komol for what was apparently excellent food and a vast menu.  From the moment I entered until the moment I left, there were many pleasant surprises.  The place was crowded and people weren't leaving.  This was on a Tuesday evening at nearly 8 p.m.  Those who came in and waited with me were locals.  Each of them declared that it was well worth the wait.  30 minutes after arriving, I was seated.  As it was just me at the table, I couldn't order everything that I wanted.  So, appetizer, soup, and main.  Fresh spring rolls.  Off the chain fresh and delicious.  Clearly handmade just moments before coming to the table.  I've not had spring rolls this good for over 20 years, when friends used to make them for me at their house.  The sauces were wonderful compliments to the taste of the mint, noodles, bean sprouts, and other delightful ingredients.  Tom kha kai soup...was told by a local that after trying this, I would be dreaming about it for weeks.  Pretty much True.  I had it brought to me extra hot (10 out of 10, on the scale used by the restaurant).  It didn't blow the roof off my head, but it had definite heat.  Yet, the pungent flavors of the soup were themselves intact.  Mushrooms, chicken, lemon grass, coconut milk, each item had its own flavor and character yet blended into the soup beautifully.  For the main, I chose a red curry chicken special, towards the bottom of the page (Pad kee delight, I think?).  Chicken, with a wide range of vegetables in a rich, spicy, red curry sauce.  I ate the broth before attacking the contents therein.  And I used as little rice as possible, in order to fill my stomach with the good stuff!    I managed to finish all 3 courses, with 2 glasses of wine, for something under 40 dollars, if not even less.  The owner and staff impressed me, a visitor, with their familiarity with a huge number of clients, who are either regulars or at least regular enough that they shared talk about family, investments, football seasons.  The owner proudly informed me that 2016 marks 20 years of the restaurant being in business.    At the end of my meal, the owner was seated behind me with his insurance agents, talking about his health insurance options for the coming year.  To be sure, those agents had had a full meal at the restaurant before he came and sat with them.  A family run business with a family feeling in the heart of Las Vegas.  What a find.  And the food was GREAT.",

I went with a 5 on the heat scale,  6 or 7 might have been a better choice for me but with new places,  you never know.  Good flavor,  plenty of food.  I took half home to enjoy the next day.  I also enjoyed my thai ice tea.   My friend chose the herbal salad and Masaman curry.  The salad was interesting,  definite herbal flavor,  nice zip to the dressing.  The Masaman sauce to potatoes was definitely more traditional,  served in a bowl as opposed to my plate.   Overall,  a very satisfying experience.

    "text": "Can I just say that Vegas Yelpers are the nicest? I went on the Talk Threads a couple of days before I flew out, and asked where the good vegan-friendly restaurants were and many suggested Komol.  Komol is kind of tricky to find, and we had to call the restaurant and have them guide us through the parking lot. So even before we arrived, the service was stellar!   The food came out quickly, and I love that there are numerous vegan options that aren't just a stir-fry made of frozen vegetables and overcooked noodles. I had the chili mint tofu, and eggplant. My one nitpick is that the eggplant, while flavorful, was very greasy. I wanted to eat more of it than I did, but we had to be somewhere else later and the greasiness of the eggplant was making me feel heavy and wanting a couch, a blanket and some Golden Girls DVDs. I could have the chili mint tofu every single day and not tire of it.   When the waitstaff found out it was my birthday, they gave me a complimentary scoop of toffuti vanilla ice cream. I will totally come back here every time I go to Vegas.",

She ordered a coconut soup and crispy noodles from the veggie side and loved it. I ordered the Tom kha with chicken and pad Thai. Both were decent but not really memorable or the best I've had. The server didn't check in all that much and left our drinks un-filled a few times. If you're in the area looking for Thai they are good but we drove about 40 minutes out of the way and weren't too impressed.",

    "text": "We were invited to dinner here with a few fellow Yeeps ;) and were pleasantly surprised! Luckily one of them let us know exactly where it was because other mentions about it being hard to find are spot on. Instead of driving around commercial center, just go straight to the middle building there and the restaurant entrance faces West. It looks kinda small from the outside but it's a good size restaurant and they seem to keep it very clean...that's always a plus!  Now on to what's not small...the menu! They have a pretty extensive menu that comes in the form of a book that weighs about 5 pounds! We got a few things to share between all of us, starting with the herbal salad, tod mun & fresh spring rolls. The herbal salad is a must try dish! I'm not even a huge fan of tofu but they fry it up and toss it with a few things like lemongrass, apples, onions & cashews. It is by far one of the freshest tasting dishes I've ever had and packed with awesome flavor and texture. The fresh spring rolls were also really good and come with a delicious peanut sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tod mun...the corn was so overpowering that I didn't taste fish at all.   We also got a few entrees...chicken chow mein, pad-thai and a curry dish. I can't say I'd order the chow mein again as it was just okay but the curry was really delicious, especially over rice. The pad-thai was definitely the stand out dish, for me. It is really, really good. The noodles are cooked perfectly and I love the texture you get with the ground peanuts. Also, if you like spicy, the little spice tray they bring out can really set the flavor off!! I noticed they offer shrimp pad-thai which I'd really like to try.  The service here was pretty good as well. Our waitress was helpful in explaining menu items to us and they kept our drinks full the whole time. I was also really surprised by the price. While most of our table drank water, there were a couple beers and the bill only came out to about $80 for 5 people. I'm no expert in Thai food but this is a solid spot serving up delicious food and I will definitely return!",

Decent prices.  Healthy options.    We had the vegetable appetizer.  Sweet potato, eggplant, tofu, spinach and egg rolls.   I was horrified when they put it at our table.  It was fried.  But the batter was light enough that the veggies didn't taste awful and overdone.  I loved it and I almost never like fried foods.  Both my dining companions had the chicken pad Thai.  One spicy and one mild.  We all ate it up in about five minutes.  We honestly were enjoying it so much I took no pictures... lol... that almost never happens.  And my one child who normally hates Asian food LOVED it!  I couldn't believe it!    We split green tea ice cream for dessert.  It was good.  Not overly sweet.  Refills on soda if you're into that.  We were there with tween age kids and the staff was so friendly and kind with them.    Honestly it was a great experience.  You can't go wrong.",

    "text": "\"Delicious Thai food in Vegas\"  Made reservations here for a large group (10). They were very accommodating and set us up on a single large table despite it being a Friday night at 7:30pm. The table was ready upon our arrival.  We ordered an array of mostly vegetarian appetizers and entrees. The vegetarian selection was quite impressive: the last few pages of their menu was nearly all vegetarian, including both standards and curries. Every single dish, without exception, was either good or excellent. Nothing was too greasy or drenched in soy sauce-- everything tasted fresh, light, and exquisitely prepared. I would totally come here again.  Service was attentive-- they checked on us frequently and were helpful with questions or special requests, and we got our food in an appropriately timely manner. The establishment was also clean.  The only weirdness was that they did not have many items on the dessert menu-- literally something close to half of it. But the items we ordered were also excellent.  Overall, an excellent choice, especially if trying to please a lot of vegetarians (though they had plenty of meat dishes too).",

Please let me me explain.   The food is consistent, and they have nice lunch specials. Your standard Thai food. But, does the food blow my mind? No, it doesn't. But it is good.   The restaurant environment is family dinner meets Thai hole in the wall. Literally. It's worth your visit, and you will leave with a full stomach of tasty food. And your butt and back will be comfortable from their cozy booths that have been around for a long time. Why don't they make seating like they used to?

How simply divine to be able to encounter Vegan Thai curries packed with perfectly cooked tofu, an array of fresh vegetables, and a balanced, creamy sauce.   Panang Curry was my hands-down favorite Thai curry dish until I became vegan and had a difficult time finding vegan Thai curries. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Vegan Panang Curry that tasted exactly the same as the dishes I savored and constantly longed for as a non-vegan. I give their Vegan Panang Curry, specifically, 5 stars. I have longed for it since I left Vegas-- it fulfilled my wildest vegan dreams   I highly recommend any of the curries for vegan peeps. I also dined with some omnivores who were just as satisfied with their food. My omnivore friends recommended the noodle dishes. For those who like it hot, this place will also live right up to your fiery expectations.   If you're vegan and love Thai food, drop whatever you're right now and take a trip to this bomb place!

I ordered soup which came out just spicy and salty with no other flavorings, I explained to my waitress she admitted there was an issue with the soup that day. Wish I had known prior to ordering. She ended up comping us. We also ordered a rice and noddle dish. I've had better no doubt. I am annoyed I took so long to write this as I cannot recall specific details.   Service was friendly but slow that day. The restaurant itself is of decent size and in a random part of town, could be a bit difficult to locate.

The service is very kind; they will come to you if you point your finger up, but they should come check on you regardless.... Still a 5star. Im no royalty. Fancy place, take your date here. And still decent prices. Kind ladies will make sure to address your concerns and bring you the right dish. Try it out Thai Lovers!",

Oh yeah, well, that just happened. Chumna suggested this place and was like OOOH yeah! I have it bookmarked too! And then we were also debating about another Thai restaurant that has a lot of vegan options as well but ultimately we ended up here. And wish we hadn't.  We ordered Rice noodle soup with vegetables: pretty straight forward - rice noodles with veggies in a mild tasting vegetable broth. Hunnie Bunnie liked it, of course she does love her noodle soups!  Also ordered Panang tofu curry: fried pieces of tofu in curry, not very flavorful and not many veggies included in the dish itself.  Papaya salad: also not very flavorful.  Pineapple fried rice, no cashews: this tasted straight up like tomatoes, she said that's the flavor of it. It also didn't seem very \"fried\", like the rice was very moist, not dry. We sent it back.  Larb with some kind of soy meat. I don't even know what it ended up being because on the menu they have Tofu Larb but I requested Mock Duck and she said Okay and then she came back out and said they could do soy chicken instead and I asked them about the Mock Duck and she said they've never done they before so they don't know how it will turn out. She said they would accommodate my request BUT if it doesn't turn out tastey and we don't like it, we can't send it back. THANKFULLY it didn't turn out BAD but I have had much better.  Typically don't most Thai restaurants do Mock Duck in many of their dishes? I thought it was odd they they have never done that before.   So we ordered everything vegan obviously and Medium Spicy. Medium Spicy wasn't even MILD spicy. This is the freakin problem at Thai restaurants, seriously! I always order SPICY, like Level 10 and it's rarely every spicy enough! Chumna cannot handle too spicy so we did medium but it wasn't shit! So on top of being pretty flavorless, there wasn't even a level of spicy for the assist.   Anyway, if you wanna see us eating, our mukbang is posted!!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FXrQs08zMMb4&s=f92a5fadb8207af48a759113ea0715fdd8b92d832ebfb8caa67caaae610d389f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/XrQs08zMMb4</a>",

We ordered the following for our party of 5:  Vegetarian Spring Rolls Pad Thai with Tofu Cashew Tofu Vegetarian Panang Curry Vegetarian Basil Fried Rice with Mock Duck All Green Vegetables in Garlic and Basil with Soy Chicken  They have an entire menu exclusively for vegetarian food (divided up normally-curries, noodles, appetizers, etc.). Portion sizes are pretty standard for Thai places. We were able to finish almost everything between the 5 of us. We got medium spicy for all dishes and they all had quite a kick (I had to order a Thai iced tea to put out the fire!). Spice levels go all the way up to Thai Hot so if you eat spicy food, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this place. Service was good; we got our spring rolls pretty quickly after ordering and they came with a hot wasabi mustard sauce (along with the typical sweet and sour sauce).  10/10 would recommend to any Thai food lovers out there!",

Their spice levels are what you'd expect for the most part, although I recently ordered the duck curry with as little heat as possible (which usually results in a base level amount of spiciness), and it wasn't spicy at all.   My all time favorite dish here is the taro ball dessert. It's served warm, with sweet coconut milk and chewy delicious taro balls. If you're a chewy texture fan you'll love it.   Enjoy one of Vegas' hidden vegetarian-friendly restaurants on Sahara, just a few minutes east of the strip!",

It's highly regarded as one of the better vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Las Vegas, but we got meat dishes and generally they were quite good. We started with an egg roll or whatever they called it. It was deep fried but may not have contained egg. Nice and crispy on the outside and good flavor on the inside. Next up was the chicken coconut soup. This is always so different in so many restaurants. There was lots of spicy red powder floating at the top of this soup. They're pretty serious about the zing here at Komol. I can't really rank it among my chicken coconut soups. It might be near the top. I have to have it again. Then came the beef salad, which for me was the only disappointment of the night. While the beef was tasty, several pieces were really tough to chew. The tomatoes also seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that ripen on the truck on the way to delivery.  The two entrees we split were both excellent. I ordered the mixed seafood in panang curry and it was all good. All the seafood seemed fresh and was not overcooked. The curry had great flavor and precision. Ted ordered the beef basil in a brown rice and it was also nicely done with a great mix of flavors.  Corkage was $5 a bottle.",

Sunday lunch brought me to a \"closed\" sign at Lotus.  Luckily I used Yelp to find another Thai restaurant.  I was amazed that Komol was so close to Lotus, pleasantly surprised that it was open, and ecstactic with the quality of the food and friendly service.  This is an excellent choice for vegetarians (60% of their business is the vegetarian dishes).  I immensely enjoyed the pork panang, and look forward to sampling the fish dishes on future and frequent visits.  I agree with the comments on the spice level; use caution, especially on an initial visit.  My only complaint is that Las Vegas has two excellent Thai restaurants within a hundred yards of each other, when I cannot find comparable Thai food within a hundred miles of my home.",

    "text": "Looks are definitely deceiving here.  Doesn't look like much outside, or inside.  Very small and cramped.  They might think about removing the booths to open up the space.  I came on a Monday night, and the place was packed; which says a lot.  I was finally seated, but quickly grew annoyed because it seemed the waiter forgot about me while waiting on others that had sat down after me.  Nevertheless, I finally ordered some chicken panang.  I was in for a feast.  The portion was huge, and I can eat a lot in one sitting!  Very rich with coconut milk and red curry.  I ordered a level 10 spiciness, but it came out as a 2.  Obviously \"white-washed.\"  The flavor was outstanding however.  I think I need to become somewhat of a regular, so they know I'm not messing around when I say, \"make it spicy!\"",

We found it on a mission for vegetarian- and carnivore-friendly Thai, and the 6+ page menu offered something for everyone.  Have had a couple of entrees here that were really good (unfortunately I don't recall exactly what I've had each of the couple of times we've gone now).  The pad thai was fabulous comfort food.  I was told the tofu curry (with heat cranked up to \"10\") was awesome.  My only complaint about them is that each time we've been there it has taken 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive.  I suppose it's a good sign really, implying that everything is being cooked freshly, but it can make for a really long wait with no food.",

The pad kee Mao is oily but tasty. I will not be going back. To be considered in my book of good eats, the restaurant needs to be consistently good every time I visit. This is not such a restaurant.

I've tried most everything on their vegetarian menu and I must say I love the orange tofu best.  It's crispy, tasty and filling.  Any Thai dish you can think of, they make a vegetarian or vegan varierty.  Duck? Check. Chicken? Check.  Soy of course...

My husbands favorite is the sweet & sour chicken or tofu . Not a big curry eater ... But my sister loves their curry .  Kind of a hard spot to find your first time going . Small little place . Suggest making reservations. Couple times we have just showed up when they had your busses out front & there was over an hour wait .  So of coarse we went elsewhere .  The prices are great & food is super tasty . If you have Gluten allergies like me ... They DO have gluten free soy sauce just make sure you request a server who is aware of gluten allergy . We have had a female who was extremely friendly , but got our allergy confused & messed up the order . Not in the best area, but always worth the drive , especially if we are heading out to strip or downtown . Definitely one of the very few places I can go eat with my diet . :)",

Instead of freshly deep fried tofu, they had them pre made and stored in the fridge for a week. Pad Thai was dry, salty, and too sour. The Panang curry that every reviewer is raving about did not taste authentic, if anything, they put BBQ sauce in it and made it taste weird. Believe me, I eat a lot of Thai food. In my opinion, Las Vegas has much better Thai restaurants than this one. I would have given it a two star, however our waiter was really nice and we enjoyed his service.",

Later on, my we all went to komol as a big group for my sisters birthday, and caused chaos in the restaurant with 8 adults, two 5-6 year olds and two toddlers.

The Thai teas and coffee were a little too sweet for us but nothing that a little extra dash of water couldn't fix. On to the main course, I went with the papaya pad Thai and my beau went for the mint beef. Although they were both tasty, I think I will go with something else as my main course. The pad Thai didn't have much texture other than crunch, you couldn't taste any peanut sauce and the papaya lacked the freshness I was craving.

    "text": "Komol is another find at a seedy looking strip mall, and is one of two Thai restaurants within the vicinity.  I didn't want to choose one over the other, as both are rated highly.  But with gluten on the menu, Komol was obviously more veg friendly, and became the clear choice for me.    And that's where the restaurant excels at.  A couple of pad thai dishes ordered, but like vultures, all the meat eaters at the table seemed to be flocking towards my plate of orange gluten, which was more like sesame chicken in smaller pieces (think, popcorn chicken).  The nutty brown rice and fried sweet potato were also a hit.    Our server advised us that they secured a distributor in Cali, and to expect to see the expansion of faux meat items on the menu, like beef and chicken, next year...All the more reason to return.",

    "text": "Originally I thought Komol was a vegetarian restaurant... as in a place that did not serve meat at all. So when my husband was craving some Thai for dinner, I'd suggest Lotus of Siam instead... But then I was informed by Jaime w. that while Komol can make everything on their menu vegetarian, they do serve meat, and their meat dishes are amazing, so we decided to head there for dinner one Friday evening.    There was no wait to be seated, which was a relief because we were both very hungry. The menu is extensive, there were multiple dishes that looked good so we decided to order 3.   My husband loved the Mongolian Beef... so much that he is disappointed with every other restaurant's Mongolian Beef now. He also enjoyed the chef special curry...  I had the Papaya Pad Thai, I tried to order it mild but our waiter convinced me to go with medium heat. I am a big old wussy so it was a little too spicy for my personal preference but it still tasted good.   When you do not have a reservation at Lotus of Siam and do not want to wait for a table there, chances are you can head over to Komol and get seated immediately. Couple that with great flavors, fairly good service and fair prices, and you have a winning combo.",

    "text": "Tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Thank you reviewers!  Location appears a little sketchy but isn't dangerous. Plenty of parking  Nondescript outside but nice inside with care given to make it attractive and clean. The menus are indeed large, wooden, heavy and unique. Staff is friendly and attentive.   The crispy spring rolls are small but delicate and delicious.   The Tom Yum chicken soup I had prepared medium spicy. It was the best I've ever had, with plenty of mushrooms and chicken and big curls of lemongrass to avoid eating. Medium spicy is plenty spicy (gave me the hiccups).  Wife had Thai-style sweet and sour chicken. Pretty good. Fresh ingredients for sure but the sauce didn't thrill me. I'm not a big fan of sweet and sour so I may not be the best judge; the wife liked it fine.   Mongolian Beef was a little tough to chew but skillfully prepared with a great sauce. Extremely tasty and a good choice for the less-adventurous; it was so good I wish I had tried something less sedate.  The pineapple fried rice was so good we couldn't stop eating it. We brought home leftovers of both entrees because we filled up on the rice. A must-eat when you dine here. We considered an order to go after we finished our meal.  Prices are surprisingly reasonable and the flavors are phenomenal.  Dollar-to-taste ratio is world-class. Next time you want Thai or just something full of flavor and umami, try Komol.",

We found it easily enough but I seriously questioned even going in after parking in front of the place.  It didn't even look open.  But we took a chance and I am really glad we did.  Inside the decor is basic but welcoming.  But I guess almost anything would seem welcoming compared to how the outside looks.  They have a great number of vegetarian options which is exciting for me as being vegetarian in Las Vegas is not all that fun.  We started with the vegetarian sampler for an appetizer which included lots of fried things like spinach and sweet potato.  It was good.  For an entree I got the basic vegetarian delight, but it was the best I've ever had.  The sauce was light and garlicky and the vegetables were plentiful and fresh.  The boy got some sort of veggie curry which he said was just on the border of being too hot for him, even though he likes spicy food and asked the waitress for medium heat.  Regardless, we were both very impressed and will definitely go back on our next trip.   One thing, the food did take a little while to get to us.  But in their defense, they do print right on the menu that vegetarian dishes are prepared specially and may take extra time.  It was definitely worth the wait, but if you're in a hurry i don't know that this would be the best option for a meal.",

No Michelin stars, no Food Network stars....just Komol.   The food here is so dependable and we are all such regulars that the staff is almost like family.   Deliciousness here includes:  Tom Kha - the coconut milk-based broth is so rich and flavorful. You can customize the veggies/protein you want added. I like it simple with lots of broth, broccoli, cabbage and straw mushrooms. It's comfort in a bowl  Fried Corn - Corn and batter shaped into patties and served with a sweet sauce. Crispy. smooth and delicious. I can't put the experience of eating this dish into words!  Papaya Salad - The papaya salad here is seriously kick-ass. It's got the right balance of sweetness and tartness and it complements the Thai meal beautifully  Pad Thai - The Pad Thai here with fried tofu is a tad on the sweet side but I actually like it that way. The noodles are perfectly cooked and mushed together with fresh sprouts, crushed peanuts and the Pad Thai gravy to create an explosion in your mouth  Ginger Tofu - Slivered ginger, soft tofu (we ask for soft and not fried), vegetables all tossed in a light black sauce served with crispy Jasmine rice. Oh-so-good for you in all ways!  Panang Curry - The Panang here has a huge following. The curry is extremely rich with the freshly ground spices spewing out of each spoonful. Eating the gravy with rice is an experience to be had  Garlic/Pineapple Fried Rice - Garlic for the spice and savory lover and Pineapple for the sweeter savory dish lover. Both dishes are excellent and really culminate an Asian meal.  Komol is really the place for every lifestyle. With a plant-based menu as well as a meat-based menu you can count on anyone who has a tastebud to be in culinary heaven.   Again, Komol is is one of the top 5 reasons for me staying in Las Vegas!",

Research led me to a new Thai restaurant, Kinnaree, where familiar faces in the front and back reassured a return to the service and food I once loved...I insisted on a photo of the cook and a promise that if she moves location again, that she tells me where she will work next.

    "text": "six stars for staying open late to feed me when i am sick.  thank you so much!  did i tell you that the mushroom tom yum is my favorite? its the reason why i fell in love with this place.   the vegetarian green curry would save your soul over the gates of hell.  its an angel with zucchini and eggplant wings. my new favorite curry.  also tried the garlic fried rice. if you like garlic, tofu, and rice, this is a A+ winner. lots of yummy caramelized garlic, tofu and rice. the only complaint i have is that it had a lot of oil at the bottom of the plate.  This is why its delicious but next time i will ask that they use less oil. if you dont like garlic or tofu, you wont like this at all.   i've been eating here all week and i also had the tum yum noodle soup, which is different than the tom yum, it has rice noodles and a sweet and sour broth.  i had this with soy fish. if you are vegetarian and crave some type of seafood sub, this dish is a happy option.  i couldnt decide if i liked the broth or not, i guess i did but im not sure, i changed my mind about the broth with every other sip, i still finished the entire bowl while saying mmm out loud.   i love this place and i give it 5+++ stars.  you wont find a place on the strip that feels more at home like komol's does for me.   i dare you to try my favorites and then tell me its not good!",

So we visited this place, from the outside, it looks a bit dull but once we went inside, it had good decor and the staff seemed really friendly! Once we ordered the food, it came soon and we truly loved it! Everything  from fried rice to Thai curry to the fried ice cream was awesome! The fried ice cream is to die for, we have gone to a countless amount of Thai restaurants anywhere we go and in LA itself, these people had the best fried ice cream. The thai curry was full of flavors and tasted out of the world. Will be back when we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp for helping me realize there were restaurants not called Lotus of Siam or Namaste in the Sahara Pavilion.   Thank you again for giving me the blueprint to ordering what I ultimately ordered from the giant encyclopedia set that apparently is the menu that they present to you at Komol.  \"I don't see the herbal salad\"   \"Oh, check the Vegetarian section, page 23 on volume 2\"   We started with the Yelp heralded Herbal salad and got it brought to the table sort of as an appetizer.   One of my favorite new dishes of 2012 by far.  Yes, a dish consisting of fruits, veggies, tofu, cashews is one of the best new things I've eaten in the last 8 months.  This should be the moment I just bow out of the whole Yelping experience altogether.  DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY BEEF AND PORK DISHES I'VE EATEN DURING THIS TIME SPAN?   Okay, settling down.   So yeah, Herbal Salad: freaking amazing.  Next.   Vegetarian Pad Thai (Tofu).   Enjoyed the flavor on this, but it didn't really seem any different than other versions I've had.  Still worth ordering if you're a big fan of Pad Thai I guess, as I usually am not.   Then we had the Chili Mint Chicken, which I liked a lot.  Ground up chicken sauteed with garlic. hot peppers and basil.  Pretty standard fare for a thai restaurant, but done exceptionally well.  Lastly I had to try the much raved about Panang Curry with beef.   I was actually slightly disappointed in this considering due to reviews I was expecting angels to descend through the ceiling and bless my lips and tongue after each bite.  That being said, it was delicious even sans angels.  It had a smokier flavor than I'm used to having from pretty much any curry I've ever had.  I appreciated the large bowl of sticky rice they also provided the table which was great at soaking up the curry and whatever other juices or bits and pieces the other dishes left on the plate.    The only item I didn't enjoy was the non-dairy coconut ice cream I ordered at the end.  I didn't really expect it to be good because let's be honest, non-dairy ice cream just by principle isn't right.   The flavor was okay on it but texture-wise I wasn't a fan.   Little chunks of coconut were present and the overall texture was almost grainy, not smooth.   With so many amazing entree plates preceding it, I didn't really mind this mild disappointment.",

    "text": "It's been a few years since our last visit (I've actually been going here for many years prior). My interest peaked when I noticed that this restaurant was participating in the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate program. Also a participant in the 2010 Entertainment Book. Located in the Commercial Center, in between a Mexican restaurant and a Japanese restaurant.   The interior looked different than what I remember. I like the semi-private alcoves (booths- ok a little weird, because my feet were off the floor and if I were a bigger person, might be a little uncomfortable; the table was very close to the booth- just saying. My husband's feet were almost off the floor) with the pretty artificial floral arrangements. We were seated in one corner of the room. There was a banana plant situated in the middle of the floral arrangement- my husband said it was funny and when I looked at it, I noticed there was a sign \"Please don't touch.\" Aside from that, much better ambiance here, as compared to other Thai restaurants.   The menus are wooden which make it really heavy- you could knock someone upside the head and knock him/her out- seriously. Pretty large menu- including vegetarian selections, family dinners (highest being $31.95 for two people with several courses), and lunch specials (only mon-fri). Drinks were soda, hot tea, thai iced tea, and perrier.   There were two other parties besides us. I don't know if this was typical of a sunday afternoon for lunch. The host and server were very nice. The server's uncle is the owner of the restaurant. He shared with us that this restaurant was the second Thai restaurant to open in Las Vegas.   We ordered the spring rolls (one order is comprised of two), chicken curry dish with potatoes (with steamed rice) and combination (pork, chicken, beef, and shrimp) thai style fried rice. The spring rolls were crispy and came with two sauces. The chicken curry dish was fragrant (mmm) and was served in a large blue and white bowl; came with a bowl of white rice. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender- excellent. It was a good size but there could have been more potatoes. My husband loves the sauce, but we had to get it mild because my husband's spice meter is pretty low (I like medium-hot). The thai style fried rice was huge. I like the fried egg, the cucumbers, and the tomatoes- really sets it apart from Chinese fried rice. Good flavor- sweeter than Chinese fried rice. We had leftovers. My husband said we found our replacement for the Mix Zone Cafe ( we all got sick on our last visit). The bill came to a little over $14 using the coupon from the Entertainment Book.",

    "text": "Today, Komol made my favorites list.  I went with a few coworkers, and we ordered a nice range of dishes.  We had the Tom Kha Kai, Panang with beef, Pad See Ew, and mint chicken.  All around, this was an excellent meal, with surprisingly high quality and fresh ingredients!  The freshness of the ingredients is one of my favorite things about this place.  The Tom Kha Kai was excellent.  It was perfectly thick and flavorful.  It didn't have the lime taste that most Tom Kha Kai's have, but only a hint of it.  This was ok though because the quality of the soup was fabulous!    The Pad See Ew was probably my least favorite of the dishes.  I have had better versions of this at a couple of other Thai restaurants.  Still, the freshness of the Chinese broccoli was amazing!  Just like my first visit, they give you big chunks of broccoli, fresh and crisp like it was bought the same day.  The noodles could have been a little bit better; there wasn't an impressive flavor to them, but enough to make it an appetizing dish.  I really loved the Panang Curry with beef, combined with the mint chicken over very nice, fluffy white rice.  This was recommended by the young man who served us, and he was spot on!  The curry was thick, which is a style I tend not to like because a lot of places make it too sweet.  This curry was awesome though, not sweet and full of interesting flavors.  The beef was excellently prepared, perhaps even a stewed beef.  With a little bit of this curry over rice and some of the mint chicken, I was thoroughly impressed.    What really makes Komol such a great restaurant isn't their unique recipes, but their unique ability to use high quality ingredients.  I am giving them 4 stars now for this, and moving Komol to my Best Thai in Vegas List!  I would take this place over the other Thai restaurant that sits in the same shopping center any day!  Things that could improve: the Thai Iced Tea, better filtered water, and the green curry is a little bland.",

    "text": "5 stars for the food! 3 stars for everything else.. This will be the spot I take all my out-of-towners if they are craving some Thai food!  I had some family that were visiting and they were in the mood for some quality grubbing. After doing a quick search on the yelp, I was intrigued by this spot. Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.  When we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously.   Food wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that. The spice level that we asked for in each dish was exactly on point, something that has never happened to me except at LoS. That says a lot.  Herbal Salad - believe the hype, for it is real. This is a *must order* item! I don't know if this their signature dish, but it should be. It's a very unassuming plate.. but aren't a lot of great dishes the same way? After taking in that first spoon, it was love at first bite. The textures were amazing. Apples, crunchy tofu, lemongrass, and much, much more. I'll leave it to you guys who've never tried it, to experience it for yourselves. You won't regret it.  Drunken noodles - they killed it here as well. I was mystified how they were able to add all that flavor into each rice noodle. It's pretty crazy. It was as if the sauce and spices were made into the noodles. A stunner!  Mango sticky rice - the mango was perfectly ripe, and tasted how a real mango should taste like. The sticky rice was sticky-icky! It also wasn't cloyingly sweet, and complimented the mango brilliantly. Another winner!  The panang curry and tom yum soup were excellent and items that I would highly recommend!  But, like in many operations, service kind of destroyed a great meal. Our server was gracious, kind, and helpful. But asking two servers to run a full restaurant, taking orders, running their food, and bussing their tables is just asinine. I know that the business is trying to cut costs, but as the great Chris Carter says \"C'mon, man!\"  Service aside, I would happily come back here because the food is that good. I shall see you on that flip side!",

Now for the egg rolls and the dipping sauces. These I enjoyed. Like I mentioned, you receive two dipping sauces: sweet chili sauce and a some sort of wasabi mustard blend, which is sure to clear your sinuses and give a hot rush to your head that will surely make your brain hurt for about a few seconds. Totally worth it., but I had a little too much fun mixing and dipping my egg roll into the two sauces.   +Tofu Panang: Ordered this with a spiciness level of 5, though I think I'll kick it up to a 6 or a 7 next time, since this is just one of those dishes that needs that extra oomph. Tofu cubes mixed in with panang curry sauce, onions, and green and red bell peppers, there's nothing to dislike. I returned to work with a belly full of curry and the need for a nap after that meal.

When my order came out first before my friend's order, one of the waitresses walked by and informed us that her food was on the way, and that the cooks in the back had to make additional preparations with the ingredients.   OVERALL Already I  foresee a future visit to Komol. Until then, I don't want to think about the distant future on a full stomach.",

    "text": "Komol has been on my radar for about a year and I finally stopped in Wednesday evening.    I knew from looking at the menu online that I wanted to try a duck dish.  I ordered the duck chili mint - boneless duck stir fried with garlic, hot peppers, and basil.  After reading the Yelp reviews of people I know, I opted for a spiciness level of 6 out of 10.  It turned out to be just about perfect considering the dish was spiced with red chilis and several slices of fresh jalapeno.  Tasty indeed but not overwhelming.  For dessert, I ordered the pumpkin in coconut milk.  It was fresh pumpkin cubes in sweetened and warmed coconut milk.  Very good!  Service was excellent.  When I asked the server about the size of a cup of soup, he told me it's generally too big for one person--people often split it--and I opted to skip having soup.  It was early and the restaurant was quiet, but everyone who works there was cheerful, greeted me, and had a big smile.  Thanks for the tips, Misti, Mamie, Holly, and Paolo!  I have to go back and try some more.  It is good!",

The peanut sauce with chicken satay was one of the best I have ever had. I confirmed that they make it in house. The curry touch gives it a great aroma with nuttiness from coarsely ground peanuts and perfect sweetness level. I am a red curry fan and judge every Thai restaurant by this dish but by insistence of the server we tried the panang and the chicken mint and I must say that he was not wrong. The prices for being in Las Vegas were below what you would expect for the quality of food.  We ended with homemade ( in the restaurant) Thai coffee and coconut ice cream. I think the coffee ice cream was dairy free",

Location - In the inner square of the Sahara Commercial Center on the East side of the square.  Plenty of parking and never too crowded.    A.  Service - The staff is pretty attentive and you can get seated immediately.  Coming in at 2:00 pm on a Sunday, there were 8 of us and we were seated in minutes. There was another large table of people half way eating and then tables of 3-4 people were scattered.  Immediately after we were seated, two other smaller parties came in and were seated.  B.  The Wait - It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and then when it came, it took another 10 minutes for everyone to get their orders. We ordered individually.  The reason given was that the three parties came in at the same time. I am not sure what you do in this case, but I would not make people wait so long. I would give them some free appetizers, or snack food or something to keep them going.   C.  No Wings - WE ordered individually and even ordered two orders of wings for the table.  Never got the wings, as an appetizer or as a main meal.  That was odd. We had to advise the server and their response was that they would remove it from the check. No options here.  D.  The Food - This is where it is great.  Sukiyuki Thai Style - I wasn't too hungry and this soup was pretty tasty. I ordered it hot and it was very mild.  Good amount of seafood.  Garlic Soft Shell Crab - Wow, what a nice tasty dish.  Beef and Bok Choy- OK, doesn't sound to Thai, but that is what the daughter ordered. I thought it was cooked good!  Massaman Curry - The wife ordered this and loved it.  Beef is normal for Massaman and it did not disappoint.  Pad Thai - Huge plate with plenty of the good stuff.  Fried Rice - Another huge plate. But we polished this off for some reason.  The Food is very, very good.  It is worth it.  Generally, the service is good, but not very professional. One time I came in and they were busy so the Tom Yum soup was served in a soup bowl and not the hot charcoal cooker it should be.  that affects the ambiance and the atmosphere as well as the hot taste!  I like this place and will come back.  Especially important when Lotus of Siam is overly crowded or closed until 5:00 pm on Sundays.  GK says, be prepared, but the food is darn good.",

A good friend of mine who is also vegetarian brought me here for the first time nearly seven years ago.  I have been a devotee ever since.  My particular poison is the Panang Curry (spice level 8) with brown rice.  At lunch it comes with an egg roll and a tangy ginger or sweet peanut dressed house salad (soup's an option, too, I think).  It's just a little too much food, which leaves you with the choice of leaving happily over-stuffed or with a snack for later.  Dinner's a much larger portion, minus the egg roll and soup/salad.  I usually end up finishing it off cold the next morning for breakfast.  It's an incredible sequel to an already amazing meal.  Some other tasty options my friends and I have tried are the chili mint, pad Thai, fried spinach (appetizer), and the tom yum and tom kha soups.  Or course, you can't leave without also trying their Thai tea.  They serve it in a tall glass, so if you order light ice and really savor each taste, you can get probably make it through your meal on one.  But why would you when you can just get another, right? :)  If you're in Vegas or will be visiting soon, make sure to give this place a shot.  It'll raise your standards for good Thai!",

It was barely even a 5. Therefore if it is spice you're craving then walk the other way. If it's service you like then walk the other way. If you're growling with hunger and you wish to wait a couple of hours for your meal, then come here :) Also they manipulated our bill. Charged us extra for white rice etc. the assumption is when you wait for 3 hours from order to check, you may just pay whatever they charge and get the heck out of the place. Sleazy move yeah.",

I ordered the chicken panang curry; pad thai with chicken; spring rolls. Panang curry was ridiculously oily that I could not bring myself to eat it and later brought it back for a refund. The pad Thai was also oily and it came in a Chinese take out box which made the noodles clump together. The brown rice I had along with my food was crunchy.  After I ate, I went back for a refund for the brown rice and panang curry. I wanted to show them how oily the curry was and that is was not edible. The man did not seem like he cared about improving these issues and just wanted me out of the restaurant. I left with a refund but will never be back.",

I'm convinced when we asked for \"medium\" the staff interpreted that as \"medium for white people\" which means \"almost no heat at all.\"  We did order a pepper chicken dish requested \"hotter than hell\" that had a nice bite to it, at least.  Food is still reasonably priced in good-size portions, and on this particular visit all five of us got a free Thai iced tea.  Never had a crowding problem here either.",

I could understand having a problem with regular supplies of lemongrass juice, and maybe even duck (though it features prominently in their menu), but being out of sticky rice??!! And out of lemon sorbet?! How hard is it to keep those two items on hand, yeesh! A more minor gripe: we ordered ours with a heat of \"4\", b/c at many Thai places, \"5\" is almost too spicy for Western tastes...but at Komol, \"4\" doesn't have any heat at all :-( Finally, when we decided to order dessert, the older lady (not our waitress) came and mentioned that we had accidentally been seated in a table that had been reserved (even though half the restaurant was empty). I guess to make us feel bad for lingering over dessert. Oh well. We liked Lotus of Siam much better, that will be our Thai \"go to\" now that we live in L.V.",

However, both the food and service have gotten worse and worse and now I never want to eat here again.  First, I realized they put MSG in the food unless you tell them not to.  Wha?  Should flavorful, spicy Thai food need MSG?  And it labels itself as a healthy, vegetarian friendly place.  The service is poor, it takes forever to get your food, and when you do get it you are invariably disappointed.    Last time I ordered Vegetarian Pad Si Ew (normally my favorite Thai dish.  I love the Chinese broccoli and yummy sauce).  Figured since it was a vegetarian dish it would probably have tofu for protein, right?  Wrong!  It had no protein except a few small beans.  It was also made with American broccoli, and the sauce tasted weird.  It tasted like it had MSG in it, even though I requested none.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is also quite weird.  It's located in Commercial Center, within walking distance of Lotus of Siam... so just go there instead!",

It's kind of a hole in the wall and a bit difficult to find if you're not familiar with the area, but it's so worth the effort to find!! Great lunch specials and great service! The food is definitely a 5 star in my opinion, but there is often a sulfur like smell emanating from the restroom area...",

I walked into this humble looking place feeling a bit bitter that I had to settle for this joint. Then, the waiter brought out our menus whose front and back cover was made of actual wood. Never seen that before. And like other Thai restaurants, Komol provided a lunch menu. I ordered the chicken panang off the lunch menu, which came with soup and egg roll. Then I told my waiter to give me a level 5 heat rating.  While the soup didn't really impress me, I thought, overall...not bad. The chicken panang was awesome and was perfectly balanced by the steamed rice. The heat rating was also right on point. Bravo!  Would I chose Komol over Lotus any day? Not really, but this place is also really good, in an of itself. But I must admit, it was nice to get away from the popularity and hubbub of Lotus and enjoy a good meal.",

We also had the stuffed chix wings which had a nice crispy batter not greasy,  served with s & s sauce .             For main course the pad thai w / shrimp was flavorful and most important not too sweet , my only complaint about this dish is they leave the tails on , in a dish that is intended to b eaten w/ utensils, if I wanted to get my fingers dirty I would have eaten peel n eat shrimp.         Beef panang was awesome very nice sauce not to thin and not broken , favorite dish of the nght for me        king prig something like that ,pork and green beans , very flavorful and nice presentation.     Chili mint chix. Ground chicken with a spicy mint seasoning. Little dry for me, good flavor though .       We had the honor of being the first customers to have for dessert the taro balls in coconut milk , I forgot the name of it but to me the taro balls had the consistentency of mochi ( Japanese rice cake) or a light gnocchi. It was served warm , I wanted to order another one but wife stopped me. I could eat a ton of this over vanilla ice cream or shaved ice.           We also had a taste of coconut ice cream, very good.              We ordered all the foods med spice, all I can say is this is the hottest med I ever had, I sweated buckets          I loved the servers because they spoke English better then me , really .         They could answer all of my questions and explain the menu to me and my wife. Usually if I can understand the waiters in an asian restaurant the food is bad.   The menu here is huge , I can't wait to go back and try it all.  I can't believe I waited this long to try it , what a dummy I am. Maybe the word vegetarian came up too many times in other reviews that it turned me off. ;)",

They have the set dinner menu options: I had the vegetarian option #2 which includes a spring roll (yummy), a thai mushroom soup (delicious) and pad thai.

    "text": "Komol is my new favorite Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, it is overshadowed by it's commercial center neighbor, Lotus of Siam, which is a shame. Not only do they have tons of vegetarian and gluten-free options, but the food is unique, addictive, and reasonably priced. Many dinner entrees are under $10, though I've been going earlier in the day when I sometimes take advantage of the $6.95 lunch specials.  My favorite dish is the Herbal Salad ($9.95), a massive mound of chopped lemongrass, tofu, green and red onions, cashews, apples, carrots and coconut mixed with hot pepper and lime juice (strangely enough, the only herb in it is basil). It's a dish I've never seen elsewhere and it is executed perfectly. It's texturally complex, a little sweet, a lot healthy, and has a heck of a kick. These happen to be the attributes I look most for in a dish, so I rank this as one of the top salads in Vegas.  The Penang curry, which I've had with both plump shrimp ($8.95) and just vegetables ($7.95), is coco-nutty, filling, and AWESOME, but if you come here without getting the curry peanut sauce ($2.50) you've done yourself an incredible injustice. You can eat this on a salad with the lunch specials, or order it as the perfect accoutrement to the ultra healthy and ultra herbacious spring rolls ($4.50). Unfortunately, my husband's favorite Thai dish, larb, wasn't done as well as at our other favorite Thai places in town, but I felt redeemed by the home-made non-dairy coconut ice cream (should labeled as sorbet). This was an interesting concoction that I couldn't get enough of, but then again I like weird stuff.  I can't vouch for every dish on the extensive menu, but I would feel comfortable venturing from my recommendations on your second visit.  P.S. This is an authentic Thai place so if you think you're a lover of level 10 heat, go for 6 or 7 instead.",

It was refreshing and more than enough to share. For the main course I ordered a lo mein dish and orange tofu (I am on a serious hunt for a great orange tofu).  Both were good and the portions were plenty to satisfy my post-swap meet hunger.   I only gave 3 stars because the service was a bit slow for the number of customers in the restaurant and the orange tofu was a bit on the well done side.

I have yet to have a bad meal here.  And Komol sets itself apart from the general Thai restaurant in Vegas by offering numerous curry options, including meals feature a \"dry curry\".  While most Thai places in town will only offer a coconut milk-based curry dish, Komol has several dishes based around dry curries (where the curry powder is cooked into the ingredients, rather than into milk-based sauce).  Delicious, but careful.  It can really kick up the spice.  Highlights:  Herbal salad (apple, carrot, coconut, cashews, basil, crispy tofu, lemongrass, and a spicy lime dressing) -- freakin' awesome Panang curry -- solid curry dish Pad Thai -- perfect noodles, rich sauce Massaman curry -- nailed it.

    "text": "Uh oh, what do we have here?  Another contender in the commercial center district looking to claim the prize of best Thai food in Vegas.  Everyone knows about the other contender.  What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food.    So here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did) and the second was to try a dish with tofu.  What?!!? No meat!  I now know what the big to do is all about.  The meal went like this...Fresh spring rolls that were delicious and unlike others I've had, not greasy.  Pad kee mow with tofu, spicy level 3 since I'm a baby.  This dish was quite tasty...at first I skirted around the tofu; then I believe I compromised it all and refused to share it.  The final dish was Panang curry with chicken; finally the meat makes its presence known...level 3 again.    Sorry to all experienced Thai foodies, my pallet cannot yet handle the crazy spiciness; with time I will slowly increase this to a 10 and just know that over the next few visits I will be updating this review to a 5.  Thanks for a great meal.",

If it wasn't for yelp and having a vegan friend in company, I probably would have never stumbled upon this place.   From the moment we walked in, we were immediately greeted with a friendly smile from who I assumed to be the owner.  Their customer service was EXCELLENT.  They gave recommendations to my friends who wanted something more beyond the overdone Pad Thai and Pad Se Ewe.  They came back to our table several times to make sure everything was perfect.  The food here is authentic and tastes like great home cookin.'    I'll be the first to admit that not all Asian/Thai restaurants are very friendly (or at least that's what I've encountered over the years) but Komol has great customer service and understands that being polite and cheerful with your customers really goes a long way.  Komol will now be my home away from home the next time I'm in Vegas.",

It is in the Commercial Center where the most overrated restaurant in Las Vegas exists..Lotus of Siam.  Eating at Komol was a real pleasure because all three Thai dishes I ate were absolutely outstanding.  I ordered the Prik King, the Basil Pork and the Panang Curry Chicken.  I like the Panang at Archies, I like the Basik Pork at Ping Pong, the Prik King used to be good at Prommares.  I haven't been able to find a Thai joint in town that can serve multiple dishes at the quality I got at Komal.  Each was so excellent I couldn't decide on a favorite.  Not only were the flavors incredible but the quantity was even excellent.  The sides I ordered were only ok to poor.  The Thai iced tea was good but not as good as Archies.  The salad was quite poor and not enjoyable.  The egg drop soup was nothing great.  The Thai food deserves a 5 star, the rest a 3 star so I went with 4.  I often judge a place by their Tom Ka soup and I didn't get a chance to try it on this visit but the photos look excellent others have posted and I can't wait to give it a try on my next visit.  Highly recommended.",

It is the best we have had in the US. We also had Chili Mint, which was quite decent as well. The rice portions are quite generous, and the service was super-friendly. When we asked for a to-go box for our leftovers, the lady not only gave us extra rice, but also 2 plates and cutlery with our to-go box!!!

    "text": "I arrived shortly before 12 and was advised that they could seat me but the chef was not there until noon when they open at noon....Their sign says 11am. There were at least 5 tables already seated.  I checked out the drink menu and ordered a split which I was advised is NOT champagne.. Hmmmm. I ordered a wine and a hot tea instead.  My friend ordered a water with a straw and she did get the straw after asking about 3 more times.  Of course the bus boy not only did not speak English he did not bother alerting the guy that did if you tried to communicate with him.   The tea came in the cutest blue and white tea pots that leaked all over the place when you poured it. Actually all their tableware was a custom blue and white pattern that was really nice.  If it had fit in my purse it would have been sooo gone! :-) J/k ....sort of. I digress. I had a Soup, I think it was Tom Kha vegetarian.  I asked for the spiciest they have.  It was really good except for one root type thing that was un-chewable like a branch.  My friend said her soup was great too. At this point I was already super full but then the vegetarian curry came.  It looked great but it was so hot that it was pretty much inedible.  When I took the rest home I looked at it and it looked like he had just dumped a jar of chile peppers in there.... It did taste good though... So, I guess the moral of the story is do not be cocky with your rating of spice although in my defense I always order it the hottest level at Lotus and it is always hot enough to make me sweat not cry.  This was \"mouth on fire then sneezing fits after\" hot. I reallize this review is not glowing but the funny thing is I really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back. The waiter did a GREEAT job handling a Sunday crowd solo. I will probably opt for a medium spicy, arrive after 12 and pour my tea with caution!",

I tend to eat things on the 10/10 spice scale, but they'll cook it to whatever level you want. Besides, the tray of crushed peppers is always available on request. The other good thing is they never seem to be too busy - it's neighbor, Lotus of Siam, gets all the fame and crowds - but Komol serves food with as much complexity and flavour for less bucks. Sure, the environment is all bland 1970's booth furniture....(unless they updated it recently)...but you get good food. All the standard dishes are prepared well - green papaya salad, tod mun, pad thai, green/red curry, etc - but they tend to be a bit greasy. Since defecting to Lotus of Siam, I have to give this (barely) one star less in my book, but great Thai food nonetheless!",

I do like mine a little more lemongrassy than most, and I thought it was amazing.  I was eating alone on my way to the airport, so I definitely get to try as much as I'd wanted.  The beef salad was good but doesn't hold a candle to the salads or the tartare at Lotus. But the [pork] larb was also as good as I've had.  Final verdict is that if going to eat Thai in Vegas, I'm going to Lotus.  But if I haven't made a reservation and there's a 1+ hour wait there, I'm walking across Commercial Center to Komol-- and I won't be too upset about it.  That may or may not sounds like a ringing endorsement, but it is.  Uncle Boons in NYC is the only other Thai restaurant I've been to in the US that deserves to be listed with those two, and that's much more fancy (not in a good way).  Also, don't let the \"vegan/vegetarian\" tagline throw you off-- it has all the non-veg options you would expect.",

Speaking of menu, Komol's is beautifully designed and crafted with some sort of heavy wood, that thing could easily double as a weapon. I was lucky enough to dine here with a nice size meetup group. We were able to sample quite a few dishes, including:  Tom Kha Shrimp Pad Thai Angel Duck Beef Panang Pineapple Fried Rice Duck Chili Mint Orange Tofu Kang Pa  I won't detail every dish, but I found their duck to be very tender and flavorful. The Panang was pretty good, but I still prefer Archi's. I didn't care for the Pineapple Fried Rice. I was pleasantly surprised by the Orange Tofu.  The bill totaled $15 per person (with tax and tip). Compared to what I spent at LoS the last time, that's a steal! I'm not going to say Komol is better or worse than LoS. They're both great choices when you're in the area.",

    "text": "After hearing so much hype about this place, I eventually made my way to Sahara and Commercial to finally give it a try.  On my first visit we ordered drunken noodles (pad kee mao) with chicken to go. She told us 15 minutes, but it was closer to 30 and the restaurant was empty. The chicken was minced/ground which was a bit unusual from what I am used to. The flavor was fine and the ingredients were quality, but it was not amazing nor did it warrant rushing back there.  I decided I would try this place again before I wrote a review. A week or so ago, I went back because I was in the field and was in the nearby area. I met another friend for lunch and we gave their lunch special a try. I had their panang curry lunch special that came with an eggroll, rice and a soup of the day for $7.95. The soup was pretty bland with vegetable and tofu. The curry was fine, but not unlike Panang curry I have tried at plenty of other Thai joints. I had spicy 7/10 and I'd say to me more realistically it was like a 5/10.  The service was very spotty and inconsistent. You can tell the wait staff started to get overwhelmed when the lunch rush hour began. But to be fair, they were pretty slow when it was just two tables in the joint.. The restaurant appears clean with interesting traditional Thai decor. The menu's have wooden covers which is a cool touch. I would probably try this place again if in the area and craving Thai, but I wouldn't drive here from home. This is a perfect example of a place being hyped up.",

Recommend: chicken panang curry, garlic rice (yum), tom ka soup, beef massaman curry, with the mango sticky rice for dessert. The chicken panang curry and tom ka soup was my favorite. So rich in flavor and the chicken so tender. Delicious! Every item we ordered was good. So if you're looking for some good eats off the strip come here. Why wait an hour at the popular lotus siam next door when you can come here? Great food for reasonable prices and excellent service. They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel. Highly recommend this little gem. We'll be back.",

The tom yum soup tasted just like water and even after my friend told the server and he exchanged it for another one it was still pretty bad.  Tom kha had alittle more flavor but wasn't the best I had. Mind you my bestfriend is thai so I've eaten my fair share of yummy thai food. The veggie panang curry was good and so was the tofu pad thai. We also had mango sticky rice and was okay. Overall not the worse like ocha but not the best I've had.",

    "text": "I'm in love with a Thai restaurant....  Thank you Yelpers for pointing me in the direction of Komol!  I've heard this place was veg-friendly and your reviews sent me on my way to an adventure.  Who would have ever thought that something called \"Herbal Salad\" would be so freaking amazingly delicious?  I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a new addiction now.  And don't get me started on the Orange Tofu.... I've missed Orange Chicken ever since I went veg, and this was even better than any Orange Chicken I've had (no fatty chicken bits thankyouverymuch).  The tofu is crispy and perfect with the orange sauce.  The panang curry is their specialty, and although it was a really great dish, it was probably my least favorite of the three (but it was still awesome).  When asked how spicy, I always order \"medium\" and that usually serves me well.  I'm not into a ton of spice, but I'm not a wuss about it either.  Komol's \"medium\" though was very spicy.  If you don't like a lot of spice in your food, I would say err on the side of caution and order less spicy than you normally do.  Like everyone else has said, this place is in a sketchy little shopping plaza.  I would have never driven in this area, let alone stopped to eat here if I didn't see the reviews online.  Although the address says Sahara, it is not on the main road- you have to turn into a plaza on the South side of Sahara, and Komol is in the middle of the parking lot.  Seriously check this place out.",

For fresher veggies and a more broad protein and seafood selection Komol has it.  Interestingly we went to Lotus of Siam first but chose not to wait in line for an hour during peak dinner time due to having show tickets so we stumbled upon Komol (same shopping center) .  We were blown away by the soft shell crab entree and chicken with greens that we just had to see if Lotus was THAT much better. The next day we went to Lotus and had Nam Prik and Khao Soi (their signature Northern Thai dishes) and wasn't that impressed.  Not much flavor in the Khao Soi and the Nam Prik was like any I had before.    Lotus of Siam overrated - for sure!",

Massaman Curry - this one was actually pretty flavorful and decent. Nothing special though.  Maybe this is a different region of Thai food because the hot sauce was also more orange than the places in LA/SF/NY. And all the flavors seemed a bit off. Not bad -- just different.

All the varieties are available with chicken and other meat too. Will highly recommend it. Just make sure you order everything below 4 on spice level to enjoy the flavors anything more you definitely should like HOT food.",

It is a little hard to find, but it is in a strip mall with a bunch of other restaurants. Overall I would definitely recommend grabbing lunch or dinner here!!!!",

    "text": "A very strong 4 stars!  I met some Yelpers here for dinner.  We took Nelson Q's advice on going with the Herbal Salad to start.  This was crisp, fresh and different (the good/refreshing different, not the searching for a modifier different.)  We were fans of the Salad, the lemongrass, fresh herbs and fried tofu.   Spice level was 5/10 and played nice with the acidity of the salad.  My point?...you should order this salad.  We also ordered Pork Pad Kee Mao and Veggie Panang Curry--wish I had read Cathy C's review that you can ask for items a little hotter here than you might at other Thai Restaurants.  The curry was a little thicker than usual...nice texture, felt a little love put into it...anytime you feel a little of the love that goes in to something that's good right?...yeah, it is!  The Pad Kee Mao was a little less flavorful than the other items, but this was the only dish we ordered mild...don't be like us...get them all at or near your maximum heat level!...added some chili flake and pepper sauce afterwards and was much better--not just heat wise, but for another level of flavor.  They do a great job here with their Pad Thai as well.  The restaurant itself is rather nice inside.  You can easily forget that you are in commercial center.  We also appreciated the signs on restrooms.  A heart of the lades chest (assuming because women love with their hearts) and a heart over the males gentiles (assuming because men love with their...,) nice and direct?...I liked it.  I have long since stopped trying to find the best Thai in Vegas.  There is a different favorite for each Thai dish that I typically get.  I would definitely come here before I would go to any hyper popular Thai spot in the same center!  Additionally though Komol has earned a spot with me for their Herbal Salad.",

It's a real hole in the wall complex with plenty of restaurants and locals coming to eat. We passed in front of Komol and after looking it up on yelp, we decided to eat there instead.  We asked waiter for recommendations and he suggested the tom ka and basil chicken.  What an experience this was. So far, no other Thai we've tried after compares. Loved it!",

The outside does not look appealing, but once you walk in, you feel like you entered another world. Nice decor, nice bathrooms, and nice heavy wooden menu!  Some of the items we ordered:  -Cucumber salad (4 stars): always love the pickled cucumber taste, although it was a little bland.  -Fresh spring rolls (2 stars): was too plain, it needed something else, maybe it was too much lettuce inside and we couldn't taste anything else. Adding the sweet sauce that came on the side made a big difference!  -Egg Fried Rice was pretty good.  -Vegetable Delight (3 stars): was good, nice assortment of vegetables, but it was pretty bland. The sauce and flavor wasn't all there, it needed more. The tofu was cooked well. I said mild, but it doesn't mean to not add flavor!  -Kung Pao Tofu: (1 star) there was absolutely no flavor to this dish. My sister sent it back and got the Mangolian Tofu which had more taste than the Kung Pao but it still wasn't that great.  -Vegetable Pad See-ew (4 stars): the flavor and the noodles were pretty good.  -Yellow Indian Curry (5 stars!): this was probably the best dish and only dish that was amazingly delicious! We got this medium spiced and it was still pretty mild.  GREAT Customer service! (5 stars!) Our waitress was very accommodating and helped us with suggestions and concerns we had with the entrees/options. Just wish their food wasn't as bland, maybe we ordered the wrong thing? Or do we  have to say Medium to Hot for spice to get any flavor to our dishes??",

I'm surprised we don't smell like curry all the time...  Anyway, this place was on my list for awhile. I held high expectations, but was rather disappointed in both the service and the food. We got seated for a late dinner, and our drink order wasn't taken until way later. My BF asked what the difference between the red and green Thai sodas was, but our waitress seemed hurried and couldn't articulate. She just kept saying one was green and one was red. We knew that. Perhaps it was just a language barrier, but we had to remind her about our drinks since they never came.  We had ordered two yellow curries, both with chicken. She appeared with two curries that seemed darker than yellow curries. Huh, we thought. Maybe they had a different way of preparing it. We dug in and it contained chicken, but it tasted awful...It turns out their yellow curry is an Indian yellow curry. She never did once check up on us, and we had to flag her down for the check. Maybe it was just a rough night, but we'll be passing on Komol. There are two better Thai places worth your money in the same plaza.",

    "text": "Komol was A-OK. Definitely not my favorite Thai place.  It was 4:30pm and there were 3 different Thai places in this commercial center. I had my niece so decided against Arawan as it looked a bit fancy. Lotus of Siam wasn't open yet. All of them were highly rated so I thought I was in for a treat going with Komol.  The service here was really good. There was always someone around and they were very pleasant.   They have a huge menu and the prices are average. They have a large vegetarian section.   The food was okay in my opinion. Maybe it was an off day? All of the food, I ordered medium, had zero spice. My niece doesn't eat spicy and she didn't notice any spice.  Combination Tom Yum Soup: chicken, shrimp, squid, and mushrooms in a sour, sweet, and spicy broth. This really lacked spice. It wasn't bad but it wasn't special. They were generous with the protein.  Shrimp Lad Na: flat noodles cooked in a wok with American broccoli in a bean curd gravy. This was good. There was a good char from the wok and it was full of shrimp. The broccoli was a little soft. I like a bite to my veggies.  Pineapple fried rice: chicken, shrimp, cashews, and pineapple. The portion was large but this was my least favorite. It tasted like the flavor base was ketchup? It just wasn't good to me.   Panang chicken curry: this was good. It was served with a bowl of white rice. The flavor was good but definitely lacking a punch of spice.  I was pretty disappointed with our meal. With a Thai tea it was about $60 without tip. When I want Thai food I want a flavor explosion in my mouth. I want dishes that have balance of savory, sweet, sour, and SPICE. Spice in two ways: Heat and full of spices. It wasn't there for me at Komol. Yelp usually never steers me wrong, but I was really disappointed. I may go back to have one of their vegetarian dinners but not any time soon.",

Look for a store front in the middle of a block with a green wall. If you can't spot it, because it is quite small, on the corner of the same block, there is a large rectangular building the has blacked out windows. I think it might be some kind of club. Komol is just a few doors down. On to the review...  I came to Komol because of their vegan-izable menu. They have so many options for veg-heads like myself which was overwhelming because I'm not used to it. Due to my indecision, I went with what the waiter suggested which was the Panang curry. I also got a bowl of rice on the side which was apparently free!   Tip: ask for crushed peanuts on the side! They will give you a container of crushed peanuts which is a fantastic addition to any Thai dish.   They curry was really flavorful and I really liked it. I sprinkled crushed peanuts liberally and it was so good!  Overall, I would come again for the options but it was pricy compared to the other Thai place we went to located in the chinatown area.",

I would recommend a reservation, the wait time can be quick or you may get stuck waiting for 45 min. It's always better to be safer than sorry.  The decor is a little dated, actually very dated... But the menu is presented in a beautiful menu book, broken down perfectly.   Sooo many vegan options!!   The service is on point and there isn't a long wait to get your food. The staff is knowledgable and accommodating. Our waters never run dry there.   The food... Yum! We always get a level 7 for spice. We love heat. The curry is never watered down and the flavors never disappoint. Always consistently delicious and full of flavor. Lots and lots of veggies, they don't skimp on anything here. They give enough rice for the table And aren't nickel and diming for every little thing. Give this place a shot... It's my favorite Thai restaurant in town.",

    "text": "My husband and I just tried his restaurant for lunch due to all the rave reviews and varied vegan/vegetarian options for me. I ordered vegetarian Penang curry with tofu and preferred brown rice but she said there is an extra charge. A dish of chicken satay arrived strangely and before we could say it's not ours, the server was gone. Finally she returned with our food, mixing up who got what. We told her that appetizer wasn't ours and she didn't say anything, just wished it away. What arrived as my dish was just tofu and some thin slices of green and red pepper in tons of sauce. I was expecting tons of vegetables. The white rice that came was inedible, so over cooked it was mush and I couldn't eat it with my meal. I asked for a new rice but the server said that's how they cook their rice! Yuk! My husband ordered wonton soup and chicken pad Thai. He was happy with his 2 dishes and claimed his pad Thai was the best he's ever eaten. That's why I'm giving it 2 stars. I'm very disappointed to say the least.",

Boyfriend ordered the combination Pad Thai which comes with chicken, beef and shrimp. At first when he got the order they only put chicken. We let our server know that we asked for the Combination Pad Thai and she was more than happy to take the order back and replace it with a new dish. I ordered the Chicken Panang and it came with a side a of rice. The food was really good lots of flavor and it was very clean inside.  Its small but very clean and cute. Will definitely be coming back.",

They have a lot of vegan options that honestly even my meat eating tummy likes. Usually I get the red curry at Thai places, but Dutch recommends the Panang and it is very flavorful. I also like the Thai Beef Salad and Tom Kha soup.   A few weeks ago I brought some coworkers here and they loved it. We basically split a bunch of stuff family style, a fresh shrimp appetizer, pineapple fried rice, cashew chicken and garlic shrimp. Everything was perfect. I absolutely love this place. One of the best Thai restaurants in town. Staff is always friendly and Dutch is the best!",

The food was horrible and absolutely, not Thai! I eat Thai food almost once every month and know what a pad Thai is supposed to taste like, I know what massaman and Panang curries generally taste like and thoroughly enjoy Indian curries. We ordered those 3 curries at Komol and we're shocked to find that all three of them were uncommonly sweet, like, dessert sweet! Sooo bad! The pad Thai we got was also ridiculously sweet. What's worse, is that the waitress came, inquired about the food, we told her that it was too sweet, she walked off as if she was going to do something about it and didn't come back. We picked at the food until we couldn't take it anymore, payed for it and left. In hindsight, I wish we'd tasted the food, realised it was disgusting and left without paying.  If you like your Thai food extraordinarily sweet, please come to this place. If you like your Thai food Thai, you will want to give this a miss.",

For starters, if you are Vegetarian, they have the most extensive menu I have seen to date, about 4 pages from Appetizers to main dishes.  They also have chicken, beef, pork, seafood as well as gluten free.  We started with the spring rolls which tasted better then any other place we have tried them.  We also had the chili mint dish, brown fried rice with veggies, and Barramundi which had an amazing sauce.  All were dishes were excellent and the price was very reasonable.  The staff are very friendly, willing to answer questions and can modify any dish.    Everything is made FRESH TO ORDER so it may take a few extra minutes for your food to come out.  They only have 3 woks in the back and since everything is made fresh don't be in a hurry, the food is definitely worth the wait.  The place looks small from outside but is actually much larger on the inside.  If you like Thai food you HAVE to try this place.",

The employees here are generally nice and friendly. It's rare I encounter a rude employee. However, the food has been SO INCONSISTENT and it's really started to irritate me. When it's correct, it's delicious and I realize why I love Komol. When it's wrong, I'm upset and not wanting to come back.  The spice levels are all over the place. I don't even ask for medium anymore because it's way spicier than it has been in the past. I ask for a 3/10 spice level and apparently that is up for interpretation on what that means. During my last couple visits my meal has been so spicy that my eyes water and I start coughing. So, not enjoyable for me. It's become normal for me to have to send my food back to be made with no spice at all and then I request the spice tray to add spice myself.  I've also had to deal with some of the entrees coming out not tasting as it should and have had to send things back to be made correctly. I don't know, I like supporting locally owned places but it can't be this inconsistent all the time.",

I kept going back, though, thinking it might be just that one day that they were not on their game, but it became a pattern.   A couple of months ago, I went here with my mom and brother and we ordered a few dishes.  Some highlights:  Rice was undercooked.  white rice.  undercooked.  served to us.    The salmon on the salmon curry was severely undercooked, too.  It was basically lightly seared on the outside and had about everything raw in the inside, and I wasn't in the mood for sashimi for lunch that day.   Anyway, we informed the server and he quickly gave us a new bowl of rice.  The server also took the salmon dish, since it was too raw for our taste.  When the dish was returned, \"fixed,\" it wasn't a salmon that was on our plate.  It was actually a fish with white meat.  It didn't even taste like a salmon.  They thought that they can pull a fast one on us, since the curry was orange and encapsulated the whole fish.  smh.  We informed the server of this, and he quickly came to defend the dish, stating that, \"It IS salmon - it came out of a package.\"  Ok, well maybe the chef picked from the wrong package (intentionally, perhaps, to save money by using a cheaper fish)?  The chef knew what a salmon looked like a few minutes ago.  The server then agreed that it was a bit on the non-pink side and just deducted that dish from our bill.    If this experience isn't worthy of the 1 star, I don't know what is.",

Anyways, on to the food-  Yum, Yum, Yum - the Chicken Red Curry with Zucchini, bamboo shoots and basil was so darn yummy - awesome creaminess and oh so flavorable - now I understand the love for Komol Curry from everyone - Damn, just looking at my picture makes me want somemore.....  *** Just wish they used white meat chicken - FYI - I'd pay a little extra ***  The Orange Beef was yummy too in the beginning of our meal however, towards the end of our meal the beef pieces just started to taste like candy and some beef pieces had too much flour on it - other than that the taste is good but the coating of the flour needs to be done more evenly cause some pieces had too much and other pieces were just right....  The 2 dishes that didn't blow us away flavor wise was theveggie  eggrolls- ugh, the eggrolls tasted pretty standard and the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp which is flat rice noodles,basil leaves,garlic and hot peppers- I think the cook forgot the hot peppers cause now that I remember and after looking at my pics I saw no hot peppers but this dish needs to upgrade on the flavor...  Looking from the outside we were kind of hesitant to go in but once you walk in and sit down you start to notice how nice and semi elegant it can be. Semi-Elegent meaning a nice place for a date or a family dinner- The Physical Menu is hellah cool - it's made of heavy wood with a carving in the front.  I do plan on coming back again for the yummy ass red curry - DAMN!!!",

What brought us here was a magazine list of spicy restaurants in the U.S. and this one happened to be in the city we were in. Now me and my boyfriend love spicy food. So we call up one of my friends and are there not even a few hours later. The place wasn't too busy for a weekend, and we got seated right away. The menu had a huge selection. The three of us decided to share the Tom Kha, Herbal Salad, Pad Kee Mao, and Chili Mint Beef.  Tom Kha - I don't think I have ever had a tastier soup. It's a perfect combination of spice and coconut milk.  Herbal Salad - Crispy, refreshing, and citrusy. Like this salad and the soup alone earn 5 stars. Pad Kee Mao - Flat noodle dish, tasty. Chili Mint Beef - I was a little too overwhelmed by the chili to taste any mint. But I don't blame Komol since my boyfriend ordered it a level 10 spiciness.  I really love that this place does turn the heat up though. At a lot of Thai places, 5 is just barely spicy and 10 is like eh. Here, 5 is regular spicy and at 10, you're on fire. Hoping to be back in Vegas soon to stop by here!",

WHAT: I have been to this restaurant about 3 plus times and they never fail to make me a happy customer. Happy customers = favorites = telling other fellow yelpers = Komol has more favorites to serve! Lol.  Whenever I come in, I am always delightfully greeted at the door, and then shown to my seat. One of my favorite things is the WOODEN MENUS. Too cute!... Inside these wooden menus, are delicious foods you may choose from: (the ones I've tried are as follows). 1. Herbal Salad: my favorite salad in the entire GALAXY! This salad is definitely out of this world. I do not know what they do to it, but they are definitely DOING IT RIGHT!! This is a must have as soon as you are seated! 2. Panang Curry: This dish is one of my favorites at every singly Thai restaurant, but their panang curry has got me hooked! I don't know how else to explain it, but it's just the blending of the spices, plus chicken or tofu = mm mm GREAT! 3. Green Curry: As you can tell, I am a sucker for Thai curry! It is just absolutely TASTY! This also will have you asking for a second order!  I am definitely going back for more as soon as possible. Get your car keys, hop in that car of yours, and head to Komol now! (Herbal Salad is a must! ;) ) HURRYYYY!!",

I know what you're thinking, I thought the same thing...\"um, commercial ctr, the same area as the green door?' i know, i know but you have to try KOMOL out  nice, clean restaurant, not a big place, wait staff super nice. as for the food....AWESOME, piping hot when it comes to your table, not only is the smell delicious but visually its delicious.    we ordered: (FYI - KOMOL does not used the 1-10 heating scale. when you ask for HOT/SPICY be careful, you get what you ask for, order a chai tea just in case)  Chicken Tom-Yum: (heat lvl med-high) if you are a mushroom kind of person, you will love this soup.  a lite chicken base soup, w/ chilies, lemon grass, lime leaves and lots of SHIITAKE mushrooms.  (they are very generous w/ the shiitake mushroom).  very flavorful, the vegetables are not mushy and lack of color.  very vibrant, refreshing soup.  Herbal Salad: OMG, i like this salad ALOT, it may be new \"go-to\" item on the menu. julian sliced apples, carrots, coconut, grn onions, onions w/ a lemon vinaigrette mixed w/ cashews and top w/ \"hot\" pepper. this salad BURSTS in your mouth. you can taste element of this salad. the apples are grn i believe, they remind me of granny smith apples.  you have a combination of sweet, salty, savory, nutty and crunchy.  the coconut adds another level to the salad. this is no cucumber salad here.  Chicken Pad Thai: (heat lvl HIGH) how can you go to a thai restaurant and not order pad thai, HELLOOOO.  my, my, my, i've tried many pad thai's around the valley, this goes in my TOP 3.  now we asked for a lvl 10, the waiter informed us that they do not do the # thing. but he's get it to that lvl for us. HA! you like SPICY/HOT then order high, heaping portion. the colors are amazing, your pad thai does not look like it was all mashed together and cooked in 1 pot, drizzled w/ oil, YUCK. (i've had pad thai like that) just like w/ the other dishes, crispy crunchy vegetables, nice chunky pieces of chicken.  the pepper flakes in this dish does not make the HEAT, i don't know if the oil used to cook this dish is infused w/ peppers, u get heat w/ every bite.  ALL in ALL a great meal, reasonably price, good to share w/ friends",

The food was good but it didn't match the taste of other places I have been to. Who doesn't give limes with pad Thai and why do I have to wait 5 mins when requested?!   The service has to be one of the worst I have ever experienced. When we got there, it was a little crowded but nothing out of ordinary. For a table of 4, once food was ordered, WE WAITED AN HOUR AND HALF for the food, and then the food came out staggered.   Our waitress, while accommodating at first, became lethargic and dismissive towards us after the ordered was placed.   The 3 star review is hampered by the service and not the food, food: 3.75, service: -4.26, it doesn't add up but definitely not far fetched either. Not a fan and probably won't return.",

We ordered off the vegetarian menu: herbal salad, garlic eggplant, and panang curry.  I don't usually order salads at Thai restaurants but my friend ordered this and I was so glad she did! The fruits/veggies in it were crisp and it had such a refreshing taste - it tied with the panang curry for my favorite dish on the table.  The garlic eggplant was also good but the flavor in both the herbal salad and the panang curry could not be beat.  Looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "This review is based on To-go food only. Not dining in. However I feel that it would be the same if I had dined in. If I ever do, I will make sure to update this review.  I am somewhat picky with my Thai food. I want it flavorful and spicy. I felt that Komol lacked a little bit of both.  I ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles and the Garlic and pepper chicken. Both level 8 in heat. I really liked the flavor of the noodles, but the spice was not there. I would consider this a level 2 - 3 at other places. That is my biggest pet peeve when dining Thai. You are suppose to have the spiciest of foods, level 8 should BURN!!  The chicken was ok, but more garlicky that peppery. And again, NOT SPICY ENOUGH. One of the reasons I tried this place was because on their website they brag about the spice level and that they can \"heat you up\".  Um, was that False advertising? Maybe I have to ask for the extra heat level?  The food had potential, but just didn't hit the spot, CLOSE, but not quite.  I would like to add that the service was exactly what I would want. Friendly people who help you pronounce the dishes correctly and answer questions when asked. Both the woman who took my order over the phone as well as the person at the counter were extremely friendly.   I wouldn't say I will never come again, but I will try to be more specific when ordering if so. Try to find that heat level they brag about.",

    "text": "The food here was decent.  No complaints.  The lunch special was decently priced and they have lots of vegetarian options, which always gets an A+ in my book.  Still, I just wasn't really impressed.  The decor was really generic (it didn't speak \"Thai\" to me...), so the ambiance, I guess, was sort of like an old Vegas lounge...without the glitter and slot machines.  The service was so-so.  We waited a minute or two at the front of the store without any one attending us, then they disappeared...once we looked around the corner it was clear that they were readying our table.  I had to wait a bit, too, to have my water re-filled.  The food was appetizing and enjoyable.  My companion ordered a medium spicy, which ended up being too hot for him (but I think that was his fault, not theirs).  I liked the spicy kick.  If I was driving through Vegas again (which I will) I would consider stopping here, as it's just off of the freeway, but I would look for somewhere better, first.  Oh!  And it was hard to find, at first.  We'd eaten in the same strip mall, before, so we were a bit confused.  Here's a bit of an illustration :  | |    |*|   | | | |_      _| | |__|    |__| Sahara Ave  It's in a strip mall off of Sahara but it's not in the surrounding stores, but in a little floating  strip(*).

There's a whole vegan/ vegetarian section of the menu and it's a smorgasbord of deliciousness. My personal favourites are the soy duck curry (get it Thai hot if you're brave), the fresh spring rolls with soy chicken, and Thai iced tea (made with soy milk). I'm not huge on curries but the soy duck curry is amazing. And if you're not into curries what so ever there's fried rice, noodles, salads, and a whole lot more. There are plenty of items for your carnivorous friend as well, which are also pretty tasty from what I've gathered. Definitely give this place a try because you'll be coming back for more.",

It was hard to find in that big parking lot, but once we found it we were promptly and politely greeted. Like everyone has mentioned, the menus are a work of art! We ordered the soft shell crab and it was delicious, but the portion size was smaller than my fist and for the price it just was not worth it. My curry was ok but I wouldn't order it here again. We actually came for the vegetarian menu and ordered spring rolls and pad Thai. The vegetarian spring rolls were great, just a bit too much basil and the serving size was huge! The vegetarian pad Thai was also great, filled with veggies and tofu! Overall this is a good place to eat if you have money!  Pros: 1. Vegetarian menu was delicious 2. Beautiful menu design 3. Caring wait staff  Cons: 1. Small portions for the price. 2. Food was \"meh\" considering the cost.",

    "text": "So, I stopped in for lunch after volunteer work in the morning.  I knew about this place because I have been in for lunch before.  However, it wasn't anything special back then.... I had only ordered Pad Thai.  Although it was tasty, I didn't find it very special so had not written a review for it.  But today, today was a different story.  :D  The entree we ordered was Chicken Chili Mint.  It was pretty good.  Ground chicken with a variety of spices that included mint and fresh red chili (hence the name).  We ordered it mild and BOY was it mild.  I would recommend medium heat. The waitress said mild is about a 4 out of 10 in the heat scale...However, it didn't taste spicy at all.  Wasn't a bad portion either.  It left enough room for two desserts.  We ordered the banana steeped in hot sweet coconut milk.  Oh how it reminded me of the Vietnamese desserts I had as a child...It made me feel like I was a kid again.  Warm, soothing, rich coconut milk drowned the chunks of firm bananas.  The texture of the bananas were spot on.  It still held it shape and was not at all mushy in texture.  This dessert packed sooo much flavor!  I recommend sipping the coconut milk little by little.  It is REALLY sweet so I feel that's the best way to eat it.  Slow...to SAVOR the wonderful flavors  :)  I ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice...and it was absolutely amazing!  The sticky rice was very warm and with the cold ice cream sitting on top of it, it resembled a thai version of warm brownies with ice cream.  Anyways, here's the kicker...the coconut ice cream is HOUSE-made!  Technically, it's not ice cream.  The base is simply coconut milk and fresh coconut water, so the consistency is more icey (kinda reminds me of a sorbet, but not as refined).  I happened to like that it had those larger icicles because it cut through the decadent sticky rice pretty well, very refreshing.  The coconut milk \"sorbet\" had thinly sliced fresh coconut and jackfruit.  I would come back just for this dessert alone.  Minus one star because upon entering the restaurant, they had a board with their specials of the day written on it which included Mango with Sticky Rice.  However, when I ordered it, they said that they weren't serving any because the mangoes they had were not sweet/ripe enough yet.  So, I would suggest not putting something on the specials board when it's not available to order.  But I can't complain too much.  The lack of ripe mangoes was the only reason why I decided to try something new and ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice...haha...  Chicken Chili Mint + Diet Coke + 2 Desserts = $23  :)",

My husband and I originally tried for a table at Lotus of Siam, but were told that we'd have a 120-minute wait. So we walked around that complex, yelped, and decided to get dinner at Komol. We put our names down, and there were just a couple of other names ahead of ours so we were hopeful to get seated in about 15 minutes, but nope - took an hour and 20 minutes. By the time we got our starters, it was 2 hours and just then, we got a call from Lotus of Siam. In hindsight, we should have taken off at that point. The Thai ice tea was decent, but it was all downhill from there.  We'd ordered mushroom Tom Kha, but got a Shrimp one instead. The replacement soup tasted like... well it didn't have one. The baby corn had clearly gone bad both in our Chow Mein and Red curry.  By this time, we were simple waiting for our check and get out as soon as possible, and that's exactly what we did.",

There was nothing really off with my red curry with chicken but I had ordered medium heat and what I got was about a 2 compared to the Thai places I frequent in Phoenix.  The second visit I started to order the chef special curry and the waiter inquired as to my normal favorite Thai dishes and suggested I should really try the Panang curry which I had never had.  So I did.  And this time medium heat was 4.5 which is certainly close enough to 5.  Just different chefs in the same kitchen will quite often vary more than a full point.  I still think I like the thinner gravy to soak the rice in of the red curry, but I like them both.",

The pad thai doesn't have that redish, orangy color.  I googled which color pad thai is more authentic and I didn't really find an answer.  But I did find out a lot of chefs add different things to get this red color from paprika to ketchup.  Regardless though, I liked the dish.  Not too sweet or mushy as a lot of restaurants can make their pad thai.  I also go the chili mint chicken.  I asked them to slice the chicken instead of ground chicken.  I'm not too keen on this dish, it was really oily and the chicken wasn't the greatest I've had.

I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here. Yet, our Phad See Ew noodles were rather enjoyable. Vegetarian options are available. On a side note, I did like their custom engraved menu covers. Hieroglyphic style Komul engravings on real wood.

Soooo good.   If you've not tried the homemade coconut ice cream with sticky rice, you're missing out. Komol blows Lotus of Siam out of the water, IMO, and always a much shorter wait.   The service is pretty stellar too!",

The menu is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge so be prepared to wait on that awhile. Everything is clearly label and the waiter was happy to answer questions. He was awesome, friendly and super attentive. The Herbal Salad is probably one of the best dishes I've had, ever, ANYwhere. \"HERBAL SALAD $9.95 - lemongrass, tofu, garlic, onions, green onions, basil leaves, cashews, apples, carrots and coconut mixed with hot pepper and lime juice.\" I have no idea what they do to make simple ingredients taste that amazing when put together but really, get there. It's a big plate so you can share it with someone as an app and still get entrees. Would definitely go back. Not a huge space though so I'd come at off hours or early.",

Komol gets pretty busy...their food is fairly good and I continue to go back.  I am hoping that they do not use MSG; I get quite thirsty every time I eat their Chef's Special, a minced meat with chopped green beans dish.  Spice doesn't do that to me as much as MSG does.  Their pad kee mao is just okay.....my least favorite.  Their curries are delicious though.  Only a few of their items are off...most of their dishes are winners.  Service has always been nice....the servers stay very busy, they work hard.",

My last 2 experiences it literally (we timed it from time of order) took over an hour to get our food. Today it took 45 minutes from time of order before we had enough and walked out. We walked into the restaurant when the entire place was dark besides one aisle, and there was one 2-top there. Somehow a 6 top who came about 10 minutes after us got their meals shortly after they ordered. We watched both servers constantly pouring food out to their table. We finally got furious and walked out. I will never, on principle, ever dine here again. If you choose to eat here, don't come hungry, and be ready to wait an hour for your food. They need to rehire their kitchen staff.",

We really, really enjoyed our dinner at Komol and will surely come back next time we're in town.  They were pretty good with my food allergies, too. Luckily I know what questions to ask (is there soy sauce in this? is this made with milk or coconut milk?), but the waitress was helpful and made sure to write \"no soy sauce\" on my order just in case. My tummy and my taste buds left happy tonight, and that says a lot for someone with Celiac disease!",

    "text": "i wish i could put ZERO stars. i had some of THE WORST service here.  Looks can be deceiving. This place looks nice on the inside...  Made a reso for a party of 12, waited 10 minutes after arriving while they got the tables ready, which should've already been ready for us. -_- It's understandable that it took awhile for our orders to come out since we had such a large group, but it Took the servers about 10 minutes before asking for our orders. One order didn't come out until AFTER everyone else in the party had FINISHED EATING.  This is after we bugged the servers every chance we got to ask if my friend's food would be coming out soon. The rest of us felt bad about starting to eat before he had his food, but we had no choice as we were on a tight schedule and were already running late. (Good thing he's a fast eater)  Weird thing is, another person in our group ordered the exact same thing, only a slightly lower level of spiciness.     The food was okay. We had to stay vigilant on when servers would pass by in order to get their attention for more water, lemon, etc. Poor guys, but i think they should have tended to us a little more often than they actually did.    To top it off, the check came with a total of $170!!!!!!!!!!! (including 18% gratuity which was calculated from the total+tax, which is WRONG). This doesn't make sense AT ALL because 4 of the 12 in our party had their own plates, while the other 8 shared with a partner.  They obviously don't know how to do simple arithmetic here, and somehow they stapled some other bill on top of ours and added it together... (we knew those weren't what we ordered)  So we calculated our correct bill ourselves and talked to the manager about it. Our actual bill was only about $109 total.   NEVER again will i eat here.  Last note, the food didn't sit well with one of my friends. He got really sick, had a rough night, fever, and threw up quite a bit throughout the remainder of the next day until we got home to San Diego :(",

Their green and red curries are to die for, careful on the heat level though because hot is REALLY hot and not as good to ma as medium on some items.

I used to eat there more often as i worked very close but now i make sure to get by on special occasions because i know without a doubt that they won't serve me anything bad. Their lunch menu is a SUPER DEAL, while their dinner menu is a BARGAIN. I think this restaurant is over thirty years old, making it one of the oldest restaurants in Las Vegas.
