For many first timers, this is a place which \"under promises and over-delivers\" based on it's location inside a non-luxury strip property.  However when you taste the quality of the food right down to the diverse bread basket to the tuxedo styled chocolate covered strawberries, you will be surprised your check wasn't more.  These steaks aren't covered with butter or spice to hide the flavor, but are dry aged and cooked on a charcoal grill right in the center of the dining area.  Portions are large and include bread, soup/salad, steak, starch and chefs vegetable.",

I typically do not like that casino but when I went to Vegas alone in May, 2013 I decided that the reviews for this place were good enough for me to give it a try. It was definitely a good decision.  Service: The service was great and I had a very attentive waiter. Not much else I can say there. I decided to hit the bar for another drink before I left and we wound up talking about the Midwest area where he and I both grew up. Nice guy!  Food: The food was awesome! I got the Prime Rib and mushrooms. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. I finished the Prime Rib but couldn't finish everything else by myself. I ordered it medium and it came medium and everything was just as I ordered.  Ambiance: This was really the only small flaw in the whole experience. The place was very dark and moody. Usually, that isn't a bad thing (like, on a date) but even then I would feel that some more natural light in the place would make it better. It was still a very comfortable experience, though, I do also wish that eating at the bar was an option. At a different steakhouse in Vegas the ambiance was awesome with leather seats, nice lighting, good balance of sound, and great food.  I would overall recommend eating here if you are in Vegas! One of the best food places I've had in a while.",

    "text": "Everything but location.  Is the food as good as what you would get at a top tier steakhouse? No. But it's good enough that you probably won't mind. The prices for steak are basically the same as the prices at a top tier steakhouse, but they come with potato and vegetable which can easily add about $20 your meal at the other places. So it's a fantastic value and it's a darned good steak!  Very friendly and attentive service. Good menu selections. I had the New York Strip and my wife ordered the Porterhouse, my steak was excellent but as soon as I tasted her Porterhouse I had buyer's remorse. Just stick with the Porterhouse! It was so tender that it was hard to tell the difference between the sirloin and the tenderloin! I appreciate that they serve NORMAL sized veggies instead of the steroid-grown veggies they serve at the fancier steakhouses, they have a lot more flavor.  We really enjoyed the open kitchen/grill area in the middle of the restaurant where we could watch the steaks being cooked. Just be aware that when you leave, you're going to smell like you've been standing over a charcoal grill in your backyard.  The only thing wrong with this place is that you have to walk through Circus Circus to get to it. But it's definitely worth it.",

We were told to enter off of Industrial which we did. The back of Circus is quite disconcerting. The parking is a big bummer here! After a bit of a meander we found our way in and proceeded directly to the restaurant.  Wandering through Circus is a big  drawback for this jewel of a place but I am sure that mgmt knows this.  Once in we were immediately seated at a very nice booth.  Water service and bread service was prompt and courteous.  All of our servers were professional and welcoming.  Now lets get to the food and beverage.  I ordered a Martini and it was delivered cold and properly made.  We also ordered a bottle of wine which was delivered promptly.  Bread basket was average.  Ceasar salad was excellent.  Filet was excellent and properly cooked.  Lamb chops were some of the best I have ever had.  This place still lives up to its reputation!  Pricing was fair, ambiance great, staff great.  Lots of people in this place so go early.  The Las Vegas tradition lives on here at \"The Steakhouse\".",

I had my eye on the rib eye as soon as I got in.  However I still asked the waitress what she preferred and she concluded it was indeed it is the rib eye.  My co meat eaters were thinking porter house but when she follow up it up being, \"Thick,\" one of my friends changed his mind immediately. The other however went with the porter house.    The rib eye was massive.  24oz to be precise.  Grilled perfect.  And I mean grilled from start to Finnish.  Were not talking sear then bake.  Grill and Grilled!  Oooooh Sooooo Gooooood.    At the end of the meal my porter house friend said he wished he would have gotten the rib eye. Us rib eye eaters just laughed.      It is on the pricey side but well worth it.  I would definitely eat here again if the opportunity presents itself.    There's definitely no clowning around with this place.",

But kept hearing about how amazing The Steakhouse is. Apparently the staff turn over is non-existent. We dared ourselves to go. It was actually one of the best steakhouses I have been to, and I am not a steakhouse girl. The bread was great. We skipped the appetizer, good thing because the dinner was huge. His steak has 1.5 lbs cooked! I had the salmon and it was delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing.  Surprisingly a really great place for an old school Vegas romantic dinner.  Saw the shrimp cocktail for another table, good Lord those suckers were the size of small lobsters!  Now if the taxi service outside were not complete harsh-holes with casual use of the N word (we are white FWIW, still not okay AT ALL) it would have been a perfect experience.",

It is dimly lit and very upscale and traditional...not what you would expect for being inside Circus Circus. On both visits the service has been excellent. Our waiter on the last visit said he had been serving here for over 20 years.   We started off with dirty martinis which were really good. We skipped on ordering an appetizer as the entrees all come with a salad and a side and the portions are pretty large. This is a nice change from your standard upscale steak house where everything is a la carte. I ordered the NY Strip and my wife ordered the Filet. I recommend getting the Waldorf Wedge to start and the Garlic Mashed Potatoes as your side. Both are excellent. The wine selection here is nice and very reasonably priced.   The steaks are aged for 21 days in house. I am not sure if it is Prime beef or not, but it tastes great. Both of our steaks were perfectly cooked. I have been to better steak houses around the country, but for the price this place can't be beat. I haven't been to the elite steakhouses in Vegas so I am not sure how it compares to those, but then again they are in completely different price points so I don't see how you could compare them. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you have not been. You will not regret it.",

The first time we were there... I had a NY steak and it was great. This time had the lamb chops and they were fantastic... crusty seasoned outside and soft as butter inside.

As we were being taken to our table, we walked by the open kitchen where the chefs are tossing huge steaks onto the grill and sending plates out. Our waitress (Nancy) was very nice and the menu is pretty easy to go through. The meals come with soup or salad and the cocktails are really good. I choose the bone in rib eye that was cooked perfectly with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Hands down one of the better steaks I've had on the strip, from the taste to the tenderness of the steak. The only thing I would change is the variety of side dishes.

I find it a more relaxing and friendlier place than Smith & wellinskys on the strip.  You walk in past the glass walled fridge /meat locker where I guess they age the steaks. There is a small cozy bar off to the side to wait for your reservation. The prices and portions are reasonable. The steaks are properly cooked to order. Some of our group whined that the steaks weren't  marinated or drowned in sauce. I find that a blessing. I like some sauces, (Izzy's medallions au poivre) but many places ruin the meat with it.

We decided to do our super sexy date night at the famed Steak House at Circus Circus. Unfortunately, you must go through a good chunk of the casino before you get there (see my review on Circus Circus itself).   We were a couple of minutes late for our 9pm reservation so the Maitre d asked us if we wouldn't mind chilling at the bar for a bit. No problem whatsoever. It was a good time to get to check out the ambiance (very cool old school decor...much like where the Rat Pack or my grandfather would have hung out). Our bartender looked grouchy and didn't have much personality at all so I made it my mission before we were seated to make him at least crack a smile. We ordered a couple of drinks and the tab came out to $18...very reasonable by Vegas Strip standards....still no smile. Whatever...you can't win them all but I was still friendly (I try to remember that maybe they had a bad day...we've all been there done that...so maybe a friendly customer could be uplifting...you never know how far a smile goes). My man and I are chit chatting and we hear loud conversation behind us that can only be described as a person with Tourettes (lots of mo' fo's and b*tches being thrown around)...or just a really obnoxious dude parading his ho's around (cheap and tawdry girls with too much makeup and vajay-jay level dresses). Needless to say my man and I got a chuckle out of this (man o man do I love people watching). Finally...the Maitre d comes to seat us.  He took us to a lovely and romantic booth (it was awesome with the exception of this creepy little kid that looked like Justin Beiber who just kept staring at us from the table across the way). We looked over our menus and decided on a petite filet and a porterhouse. Both came with soup or salad, choice of starch and a chef inspired veggie. Our server was nice but nothing to write home about. She seemed bummed that we only ordered one round of drinks and no appetizers (we were not that hungry). The black bean soup was wonderful with a side of chopped onions and a shot of sherry....delicious and filling. The salad was just your typical salad with blue cheese. Our main course came out and was lovely. The steak cooked just right (med-rare...is there any other way?). I opted for the baked potato and he got the garlic mashed potatoes. Both were tasty...but I think I would have to say the mashed potatoes were better. I couldn't eat much of my meal because the soup filled me up...so my man got an amazing doggy bag.   We decided on no dessert because my dress was starting to cut off my circulation. Overall it was an A-Ok experience. We will probably be back for the value but I cringe at the thought of having to walk through Circus Circus to get there.",

    "text": "What's there to like about Circus Circus? THE Steak House, of course. Atmosphere and food! If you're searching for the True feel of an old school Las Vegas steak house, look no further. Yeah, the BigTop could use a lot more than just some fresh paint (think wrecking ball) but its old and does not try to hide the fact when compared to the plethora of fancier addresses on the Strip.Think of it as a history field trip and enjoy it while its still around!  If you like the social scene of a loud, trendy, expensive, restaurant that will remind you of your favorite campout in LA or NYC, this is not for you! If you're a social climber, who needs to hang out in hopes of seeing stars, then head South on Las Vegas Blvd.  But if you're willing to travel to this part of town (and by the way, its not as unsafe as you might think), look past the faded paint, chipped concrete, and are willing to have the driver wait for you outside the Circus, you will find a real diamond in the rough here! Cabs are cheaper than car services (bus even cheaper), and walking can be a real cultural experience! Weave thru the older casino, past the circus acts to the dimly lit entrance where you'll be greeted by a view of the dry aging room. Pass the hostess, bar, and open kitchen on the way to your table, which might just be one of the genuine studded naugahyde booths. Very much what I always pictured be an old school Vegas steak house to be like!  Nice servers like Michael Champeaux who has been there for 26 years will often remember you from a past visit. Consider that these guys were doing this before they had those cards you have to put in the slot machines to track your play. They still have it. If you're old enough to remember, back then it was all about taking care of customer. Anyone could be a high roller.  Okay, the food. The bone in ribeye is a True Fred Flinstone cut; and, one of the best I've had. The lamb chops are awesome too. Reviewers give it mixed marks on the vegetable sides, and I liked the duck fat fried potato wedges (last year) better than the regular fries cooked in duck fat this year. But everything else more than makes up for it. Great big cocktails. Nice, fresh bread selection. For the a la carte price at most fancier addresses on the strip, you get soup or salad, as well as vegetable and potato too. A very good value for the high quality atmosphere, service and excellent food!  I'll be back!",

    "text": "The bf and I redeemed some of the comps from the My Vegas app game and were excited that this place offered a $150 comp for dinner.  Reservations were made to air on the safe side.  The restaurant was dark when we arrived.  The meat aging room was right behind the host podium which was pretty neat.  We were seated in the lower area where we could see the grill.  This place had the steak house atmosphere, but definitely could use some redecorating, but considering it is located inside Circus Circus, we did not expect much.  Our server at first did not seem too thrilled since we had our toddler son with us, but she warmed up a bit throughout the service, especially after he behaved for most of the dinner and we left her a nice tip.  At first she had an expression that seemed to imply that she was disappointed and trying to guess if we were one of those people that would use a comp and not tip accordingly...as a former server, I have always been sensitive to this and we generally tip pretty well if the service is at least decent.  The Hispanic man who brought us our bread, beverages, cleared our tables, and packed up our leftovers did most of the work so we hoped that she shares the tips with him.  This was probably one of the best steaks we have had.  The bf ordered the Porterhouse medium well and I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, it is not every day that we are able to go to a place that actually knows how to cook steaks the way they are ordered.  The steaks are aged 21 days here and yes, we could taste the difference.  We opted for baked potatoes which came with the condiments to share on the side-sour cream, butter, chives, bacon.  Vegetables were sauteed baby carrots.  The salad was decent, but the blue cheese dressing was amazing with large chunks of blue cheese.  Our only complaint would be that the bread was cold...and to our disappointment, there were no cow-shaped butter chunks as seen in the other Yelp reviewers' pictures.  We were able to order dessert as well and the total came out to around the price of the comp.  The desserts were a bit disappointing, nothing to write home about and we will definitely do without next time.",

(Prime Rib $47, Petite Filet $37)  The service was OK... they were fast with water but other than that... not much conversation or smiles but nothing to complain about.  Our Petite Filet was so overcooked that we could taste was burnt meat.  The Prime Rib was so huge... then again for $47 dollars... you probably expect it to fill you up.  A lot of fat on the prime rib but also plenty of meat too.  Just takes a bit of work to cut around the unwanted parts.  It's good... but not THAT good. Ruth Chris Steakhouse is better in my opinion. Good for a steakhouse inside the world's most disgusting hotel/casino in the world.  Seriously... why have a kid's hotel inside Vegas?  That's a whole another story there...",

    "text": "Went here for the inaugural Spring Restaurant Week in Las Vegas. Figured I lived in Vegas long enough that I should check out Circus Circus at least once and with all the accolades THE Steak House has received, I could kill two birds with one stone.  First off, parking at Circus Circus isn't that great. Both garages were closed?; I would have probably been better off valeting. Also, go in off Industrial as opposed to the Boulevard as that would have been much easier as well.   Now the important stuff... the food. Great bread basket. I love carbs and a good bread basket and this one had a great assortment. For the appetizer, the Caesar salad was awesome. One of the best I've had. I was also told by a member of our party that the French Onion soup was the best they ever had as well. Good start. The main course was Filet Oscar: a 12oz filet topped with king crab and bearnaise sauce. I probably would have preferred to have the crab as an appetizer and just ate the filet separately as I think the toppings took a bit away from the filet. I ordered it medium and it was good but wasn't the best filet I ever ate. Another member of the party got medium-rare, I ate part of that, and I felt it was much better than my medium despite me not normally liking rare. I'll give the medium filet a 3.5 and the medium rare filet a 4. As for desert, there were plenty of great looking options on the cart. Everyone got something different and no one complained. I had a raspberry chocolate cake which was way too big after what I had already eaten and  was a real good way to end a meal. Nothing went to waste.  All in all, I went in feeling under the weather but left stuffed and content, definitely happy with my Restaurant Week choice this time around. So far with my Restaurant Week choices, I'll put THE Steak House above Palm Restaurant however I don't think I can quite put it above the Capital Grille.",

    "text": "Had high hopes in this place after reading the many raving reviews about this place. I have to admit, was a bit skeptical when I heard it was at Circus Circus, but hey, I'm game and it's won best steakhouse for 2 decades. Two decades. That's quite some time, yeah?  Word of advice. Don't get all dolled up when you go to this place as you will feel very awkward. I was all decked out in a mini black dress and high heels because we were going to head over to Prive afterwards. Wished that I had on flip flops and some casual attire. So out of place.   With that aside, I ordered the rib eye {bone in} with baked potato, house salad with ranch dressing and the cheesecake + banana foster for dessert. Later on why I ordered two desserts.   The bread basket was good. It was filled with an assortment of breads and they were warm! Hence, the added star. Seriously.   Salad was eh. Thought some of the lettuce was a bit wilted. Nothing really to talk about. The steak felt charred and there was really no taste whatsoever. It wasn't even that tender, either. The cheesecake tasted as though it's been in the refrigerator for AGES. However, the banana foster quickly made up for it as it was muy deliciso. I highly recommend this dessert!    I was secretly hoping that this place was going to win me over and take the place of Ruthchris's or Morton's. Sadly, it didn't and it was a huge disappointment. The prices are really reasonable {for a steakhouse}. My rib eye was $44 and it included a salad, and a baked potato. No a la carte menu here.   Probably wouldn't want to return here, unfortunately. Although, if you are a big prime rib eater, my eating companions  say that they prime rib tasted much better than the steak.",

I will not let my review to be influenced by the 2 star rating of the Circus Circus hotel.   I have to say, this is one of the best restaurants on the strip. I give 5 star to its service, menu selection, meat quality, price, and restaurant decor & layout. With a little bit of great steaks I've had over the years, I think I know a good piece of steak when I eat one!  When I order medium rare, it is medium rare with blood (yum!), we ordered all the great cuts of beef from prime rib to filet mignon.  All of the dishes were cooked to perfection!  I went with all guys and they are all your typical carnivores.  This is definitely the place to go if you are looking for a fair priced quality steak house in Vegas.",

The steak was fine but as I said not amazing.    Now lobster is even more important.  Lobster is pricey, and I understand and accept that.  It's expensive because every bite you take is like an orgasm in your mouth, or should be.    The lobster here was overcooked and on the chewy side.  In retrospect I should have sent it back, but I have a rule. Never, send food back.  Life's too short... and I know too many people in the food industry.",

Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine circus circus to have a top notch steak house.   We were privileged and graciously invited to go to dinner with the same group along with vendors/customers from the World Builders Convention. Its been years since Ive been to Circus Circus and nothing has really changed structurally... However, step into The Steak House restaurant and its like stepping into a different time zone and let alone you forget that your at a hotel. Everything is structured with wood, nice bar, and the place is quite dim... sort of the 1960's look that you catch from the movies.  Appetizers: Crab legs - according to my companions it was very good. Shrimp cocktail - Amazing, I believe its tiger shrimp cause those baby's where big.  Dinner: Ordered the New York Strip and it was cook to perfection. Very tasty and juicy. Complimented with the Mash Potatoes and Asparaguas (winning combination). Everything was prepared excellently.  You're served with a array of bread, each looking very good! the one's i did try was absolutely delicious.  Dessert: I can honestly say close your eyes and just pick one. All the dessert dishes are delicious.  This restaurant exceeded my expectations.",

    "text": "This place is a great hidden gem. I found this place reading reviews on some other restaurants on the strip, I assumed the first couple were just people who got paid to make positive reviews, but I read on. Everyone is right, this is where all the locals go, and for good reason. I made reservations with my wife on a Thursday evening and I would definitely recommend the reservations. The first thing you get is the bread. I think they give you 6 different kinds of breads all in one basket, so good. We started out with the sauteed mushrooms, a great choice. At $9, it's the cheapest thing on the menu and boy is it worth it. They split it up for us without us even asking and the mushrooms filled 2 bowls. Honestly, they could've been a meal in itself. I ordered the bone-in rib eye medium rare and my wife ordered the filet the same. At the time, they were running an anniversary special and the filet was only $39 instead of the usual $51. The sides that come with the steaks were huge. In fact, the next time I go I'll be sharing the rib eye with my wife and paying the $10 shared plate fee to get the extra sides.  Their wine selection is great as well. The only downside is it's in circus circus, so that means you have to park and walk through a terrible hotel, I'm sure there's a valet you could use in the front, I just didn't use it. Either way, it wouldn't be fair to detract from the restaurant's rating.  Not only is this place better than any other place I've eaten on the strip, it's cheaper and includes all the sides. I forgot to mention the water comes from bottles your waiter pours you, it's the little things. 5 stars",

They taste, or lack there of, frozen. The steaks however, petite filet and NY Strip, were cooked a perfect medium rare. Full of bloody flavor, and the mashed potatoes werent too bad either. We ended the night with the raspberry chocolate cake which wasnt all that great.  Nights like these I feel good not being a vegetarian.  The dress code is very loose. As you walk in it says resort casual, no tanktops. I saw 3 diners in tanktops. I guess you cant turn business away during tough times",

    "text": "Have heard about The Steakhouse here at Circus Circus for a while.  Prices are high so I was expecting quite a treat.  Made reservation and arrived a little early and was pleased they could seat us sooner. We were shown to a booth directly facing the area where they cook the steaks, the smell of the mesquite smoke was delightful. Server came and introduced himself, they only had a wine menu, no cocktail menu or beer menu.  We ordered drinks and they were delivered within a few minutes along with a selection of bread, rolls and breadsticks.  I'm not sure about bread and rolls with raisins, I prefer savory bread and rolls. Me and Johan ordered the Rib Eye steaks, our friends the Filet Mignon and petite prime rib.  Noticed prices were about $10 to $15 more than a menu I'd seen online, meals came with choice of potato, vegetables and with a salad or bean soup to start with.  We ordered 3 salads and I upgraded my bean soup for a French onion soup for $6 more.  Salads were nicely presented and no complaints there, my French onion soup was served with a whole spring onion for some reason.  I'm a French onion soup fanatic, this version was watery and lacked any depth in flavor, not worth ordering or finishing. Meals arrived, both rib eyes were cooked well, my medium well was a tad undercooked, but ok.  Garlic mashed potatoes were bland, creamy but just bland.  Broccolini was just steamed and so so.  Our friends said the Filet Mignon was dry.  Fresh cracked pepper offered with the salad but not with the entrees? Server came to check on meals way too early, nobody had touched their steaks yet, didn't see him again till end of meal.  Friends had not been offered drink refills.  He cleared our table and asked if we wanted desserts or coffees, we asked for a menu and again told they don't have one, he rattled off a list of desserts and coffees and gave us a few minutes to consider.  I personally don't like ordering without knowing prices, was already surprised by more expensive menu to start with.  We declined desserts and just got our check.  For 2 of us, rib eyes, 2 beers and $6 soup upgrade was $167 excl tip.  Did not live up to the hype at all, if I spend that much I expect perfection with food and service and was let down on both points. Johan and I had to make a pit stop before returning home as we both had to run to the bathroom!  Not a nice finish to a nice night out.",

The New York was slightly on the medium side and was not consistent as they left it on one side a little longer in the cooking process. We did not complain to our server as we tried both cuts and they were enjoyable, I do have to say they could use some extra seasoning (had to add salt which I had never done to a steak after it was cooked). If it was just for the way the steaks were cooked it was a border line 3 stars. Three things made me give this place 4 stars. 1) I love black been soup and I was served the best black been soup I have ever tasted. 2) The bake potato was on point, the skin was cooked (and seasoned perfect). 3) The price point, even though the steaks were not cooked perfectly they were tasty enough that we did not have to send back.  Overall, not our favorite steakhouse in Vegas but would definitely give it another shot just because of the Black Bean Soup.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about the steakhouse before I showed up, heard it even had a high zagat rating.  I decided to go with the porterhouse, which turned out to be cooked right, but absolutely no taste. I found with Porter houses that you really have to season them to get the best taste.  Had mushrooms as the side dish; Smaller than most places that I order mushrooms and they were just OK. The reason for the 2 stars: 1.  I sat in the bar area and Lea the  bartender was Excellent, and that added the star. I ended up with food poisoning, and when you call to tell them about that you get routed to security. And They asked every personal question under the sun.  And it's now Thursday and this happened Sunday and there was no response from management, this food really ruined the rest of my trip to Vegas. I'm very unhappy and I know now never to return to this place as they don't have the courtesy to follow up and their food is lackluster.",

    "text": "My family regularly stays at Circus Circus because my 3 kids who are 12-16 love it there. We've been curious about The Steakhouse, which is located on the ground floor, and finally managed to have time to try it.   We made a reservation online with no problem. Upon arriving at our scheduled time, we were immediately taken to our table. So that was nice.  The decor is pretty old-fashioned, I'm not sure if that's \"in a good way.\" But it was comfortable and clean. The meats are being grilled right in the middle of the restaurant so that was kind of cool.  Our server was nice and polite, if a little stuffy. We got a bread basket right away. It wasn't impressive and the butter was frozen, but you know, whatever. It's bread.   First we ordered the French onion soup and the grilled shrimp. Both really, really good. I love French onion soup, so I was very happy to have a good bowl.  On to the entrees. My husband had the ribeye and I had the petite cut prime rib. According to the menu, you are supposed to have a choice of soup or salad with that, but we were not offered this choice. I don't know why. But that was pretty annoying.  The food was delicious. I mean the garlic mash and asparagus were kind of bland and \"meh.\" But the meats were perfectly cooked, juicy and came in large portions.  For dessert we shared the creme brulee, which I have to say was horrible. It was totally grainy and so unpleasant. I was soo disappointed because I love creme brulee.  So...basically a star lost for the snobbish server, blah-ish bread with frozen butter, lack of side salad (or soup) with our entree, and the worst creme brulee I've had since I tried to make one myself with no blender in a slow cooker.",

As I've read, the salads seemed to be pre-made and lacked freshness. My steak (bone in rib eye) was ordered medium rare and it was medium to medium well.  In addition, there is no way that steak was a prime cut and I question if it was even a choice. No tenderness and lacked flavor telling me that there was a lack of fat throughout the steak.  We've eaten at several different restaurants this week and I have to say that I was very much disappointed in all except one. I think Vegas has lost something when it comes to food. It seems the prices keep going up and the quality is going down.",

I told my old man there on Father's Day where this place turned 32 years old so they had some great specials.  I got a $32 birthday special; a petite filet mignon (8oz) with sides included.  My dad got the Father's Day special for $53 which included a Ribeye, salad, dessert.  This wasn't just an 8oz filet I had.  8oz always concerns me, usually places say 10oz or 12oz and it looks smaller.  There's no way this was 8oz... and that's a good thing.  It looked a lot bigger.  Tasted amazing - perfectly cooked medium-rare.  Also, when it's not a special, their prices include sides and that's key.  You might think, \"Well, their steaks are in the mid $40-range, why would I go here and no somewhere else?\"  Those places then offer sides starting around $12 each... two sides, tack on an extra $24.  Not here.    The service was spot-on, which I always appreciate.  Top notch place.  Yes, the Circus Circus thing is a huge deterrent, especially if it's for a date, walking through the lobster-tanned zombies crawling through the casino but once you get through that... it's great.",

However those days are clearly behind them. My friend suggested it, having lived in town for a year and heard of its \"best of Vegas\" status.  From the beginning, hostess had a line 5 deep to be seated and was chatting away with the guy at the front. Restaurant was half empty, there should not have been a line at all. We were sat in a table next to the grill. Again, the place is half empty why put us next to the smoky grill instead of a booth. Salad was mediocre. We both ordered the ribeye medium-rare. His came medium. For a $66 steak it should be perfect. Oh, and did I mention we had to walk through Circus Circus! Why are there so many babies in a casino? Never again",

And probably 2/3 the weight of the cut. It should not have been served, but rather discarded. My wife's filet was really tender but the flavor was non existent. The asparagus were thin and still not cooked to tender at the bottom of the stalk. In other words, the bottom part of an already thin and short asparagus was inedible. The crudest salad was drenched in dressing and the romaine lettuce was soggy. And to top it all off, the prices of the food are 5-star prices but this is clearly a 3-star steakhouse.   The only saving grace was the waiter. He was a good guy, very friendly. But we're not coming back for him, and would never come back for the food. Go somewhere else for these prices!",

Everybody and their mama has nothing but good things to say about this place and I've been more than eager to give it a try. My boyfriend and I finally went for our anniversary dinner. We were so excited to go that we went all out when we ordered. We got the seafood platter as an appetizer, which was HUGE. Definitely too much to share between just 2 people before a steak meal. The platter included shrimp, oysters, and crab legs. All of which were just okay.  For our entrees, I ordered the porterhouse and my boyfriend ordered the bone in ribeye. Each meal comes with either a soup or salad to start, vegetables on the side, and your choice of potatoes (mashed or baked) or rice pilaf as accompaniments. We ordered our steak mid rare, of course, but mine came out more on the medium side. I'm not one to send food back so I settled with what I had.   Honestly, to me, the steaks were kinda dry and not very flavorful. I've definitely had better at other steakhouses. I guess what people love about this place is that, for the price of the steaks, you can't go wrong. They are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than most other steakhouses, but I personally tasted that.   Wait staff is great though. All the servers were polite and friendly and had great recommendations.",

    "text": "Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:  I have often read about how good this place is and I wanted to try it.  What better way than Restaurant Week.    The bread basket had a very tasty piece of lavash, a seeded roll of some kind, a pretzel roll,  and two slices of raisin bread.  The raisin bread was also good and the basket came with the bread warmed.  Course 1:  I chose the black bean soup which was served with a small dish of chopped red onion and a tiny pitcher of sherry.  The onion added to the somewhat bland soup.  Since I don't do alcohol, I guess the sherry would kick it up a notch.  I depended on some salt.  It was a good starter.  Course 2:  I had to do the Filet Oscar and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a 12 ounce monster so go hungry!  I asked for it cooked black and blue and it was--nicely charred on the outside and blue from shivering on the inside.  These steak chefs know how to cook a steak the right way.  If you look at my photos, you can see the flaming grill.  My steak was in the middle of the flame for a short while.  The cook took some beef skin from a rib roast a put it on the grill.  When the fat dripping onto the mesquite flared up, he placed my steak in the middle.  With the steak came some nice king crab meat, two asparagus spears, and some excellent Bernaise.  I opted for the bake potato and the vegetable for the evening was baby carrots.  Before the entree was brought, a server had delivered to the table a plate with 4 small dishes with chives, butter, sour cream, and bacon bits.  You could load up your baked potato, or not, any way you wanted.  I like the do it yourself style.  Course 3:  For dessert, they bring the dessert cart to your table.  There was a chocolate mousse cake, their take on Bananas Foster with the ingredients in a martini glass, cheesecake, some others I can't remember and the raspberry chocolate cake I ordered.  It was great!  My server was Mitch and he was an attentive and pleasant fellow.  I would have given this 5 stars but for a few things that caused my downgrade.  There was some crab shell in my king crab.  The carrots were very crisp--undone crisp--and were only lukewarm.  I was there at 5 when they opened so they weren't done enough yet.  Later as I watched the chefs place carrots on dishes, I could see the steam coming from them.  Finally, I had a long wait for an iced tea refill the first time I requested it.  Otherwise, service was good.  Note:  They do not take the M-Life card if you're using the purchase for tier credits.  For some reason (well we know why), Circus Circus is the poor stepchild of the MGM Resorts.  Your check will say use your M-Life card, but you can't.  I'll be back.  This is a gem of a place.",

    "text": "It has been a tradition among our group of friends to go out for a good steak one evening during our annual Interbike trip. In the years past I would have easily given this a five star rating.  Not so much this time.    We had reservations for five people and were promptly seated at a table that should have been used by four even though there were empty tables around the place.  The service was fine and I cannot fault the wait staff in any way.    We started with drinks of course, Makers on the rocks. For twelve dollars in a town that throws alcohol at you, you would expect a decent pour.  The drinks were heavy on the ice and very light on the Makers Mark.  I have had more generous pours while playing nickel slots.   The big disappointment was the steak. Four of the five had us had steak, mine was a bone in rib eye which while cooked correctly, medium rare, was dry and tough.  All of the steak eaters at the table had similar experiences and two were served cold mashed potatoes.   As a group, we didn't discuss our impressions of the meal until after leaving the table.  We all thought that our experiences and concerns were unique and did not want to ruin anyone else's dinner by complaining, but after leaving we compared notes. At that point, one member of the party returned to speak to the management.  To be honest they did not seem that concerned.   This was once a great steakhouse, and worth the money. For my money, next time, I'll be going elsewhere.",

    "text": "Honestly I've been to many steak houses in Vegas this is not one of my favorites. Yes prices in comparison to other steakhouses are good but the steaks weren't all that wonderful. I recently took two doctors who work for me out for a meeting and saw that this would be a great place with a great ambience. The ambience was great but the steak was not to be much desired for. I got the prime rib, the big giant bone in cut , and it was literally 95% fat. The asparagus was bland and the bread that they initially served wasn't that hot. The salad was decent but nothing compared to the Cortez room for other places I've been. My two Dr. Friends got the porterhouse which they seems to enjoy all the one said it was a little too Blackened.  Honestly I would never go back. Not because of any other reason except for the quality compared to what they really pretrade themselves to be. The flavor profiles weren't there. Yes the ambience was great staff was extremely friendly as well. But it did not leave me longing for more. I will continue to search for that perfect five star steakhouse that has a little bit of everything to please everybody's palette !",

    "text": "We came because of the hype about how this is the best steakhouse in Vegas. Definitely not worth the exorbitant prices.  First off, you have to walk 15 minutes through circus circus casino which is literally a circus.  The menu is very limited. Steaks (of course), 2 fish dishes, lamb chops, chicken. Includes bread basket, choice of potato or rice, vegetable of the day, and salad or black bean soup. No creamed corn on the side menu. The bread basket was warm (not hot) and looked like it came from Costco. The water was poured directly into our glasses from an Arrowhead plastic bottle. Seriously, we're paying $50 and $56 for steak, and you couldn't give us Evian?  Or how about springing for a few glass decanters?  My boyfriend got the petite filet, butterflied. He said it was completely dry. I ordered the rib eye steak and it was good but not delicious. The desert tray again looked like it contained items from costco's bakery.   You're better off going to the Prime Rib Loft in the Orleans for half the price.",

I loved the house salad with Italian and the fixings that came with the baked potato to add , chives , bacon crumbles, sour cream and butter.

    "text": "When I first added THE Steak House to my Yelp Bookmarks, it was kind of as a joke. I'm not the biggest fan of Circus Circus and I generally avoid going there, so when I read that one of the best Steakhouses in Las Vegas was located inside, I was skeptical to say the least.  They absolutely defied my expectations.  The service was excellent and we were seated promptly for our 5PM reservation (after a brief tour, which was basically telling us what things were as we passed them)  The better half and I enjoyed the Pretzel Rolls that came with the bread, but admittedly, I think we are both Pretzel Roll addicts.   I had the Spinach Salad (With Bacon Dressing) and was not disappointed.   For the Entree it was the Fillet Oscar with a Baked Potato.  I don't know what the deal with this Baked Potato was, but it was one of the best I'd ever had.  The Steak was prepared perfectly to my tastes and was also delicious with the Crab Meat and Bearnaise. I never wanted it to end, but my stomach had other plans.  For dessert the Raspberry Cake, which might have ended up being a bit much for my belt, but it sure was good!  The price was undoubtedly on the high side, especially considering it is INSIDE Circus Circus, but it is Vegas, and I knew what I was getting into.  I guess my only real complaint was that it felt like it was a bit on the dark side.  I'm all for Ambiance, but I really felt like I needed to start using my phone as a flashlight!  I highly recommend a visit if you are looking for a Steakhouse to try.",

It's not like Circus Circus is bad, it's just one of the older casinos on the strip and is a bastion of that cheesy 1980s-ness down to the carpet. But step into the Steakhouse, and you are absolutely transported into another time/place/frame of mind. Super classy, super low-key, with excellent service and even better food. My sister took me here as a Christmas present, and it was probably the best present I've gotten in years. Food was perfect, and my gigantic porterhouse steak was an absolutely perfect rare. Do yourself a favor and take a loved one (or, hell, just yourself) here, get a gin martini, and soak it in. Leave the meat sweats for later.",

    "text": "A rare gem hidden where you wouldn't expect it. Superb value/quality for money.  I was looking for an above average steakhouse to dine with family and upon consulting Yelp, The Steakhouse checked all the right boxes:  Good food Good service Good value plus the added \"old school\"/ \"hidden gem\" allure.  I arranged to visit The Steakhouse early, just when it opened up for the evening. As soon as you enter you can see the room where they age the steaks. The overall lighting is low, with the appropriate amount of light on each table. The overall decor  might seem \"old school\" as others have pointed out but I found it to be very appropriate for the type of the restaurant. The music also seemed to compliment the \"old school\" atmosphere with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin lightly playing in the background. While this looks like a somewhat \"dressy\" place the atmosphere is quite relaxed and unpretentious.   All dishes at The Steakhouse include a big bread basket with quite a variety to choose from. All of them were fresh and delicious.  We tried the Porterhouse, Ribeye and Filet Mignon; all were cooked to perfection. Unseasoned of course so you can better enjoy the taste and quality of the meat and also so you may add one of the sauces The Steakhouse offers. The green peppercorn sauce stood out, crisp and flavorful.   Each steak costs about $50 which I think is very reasonable: Meat quality and cooking is splendid and the price includes the big bread basket as well as your choice of a salad or soup AND (that is, in addition to) your choice of baked potato, mashed potato or wild rice blend.  Since it was my first time at The Steakhouse, when I asked for the dessert menu, I was surprised to see that our server actually brought a whole dessert cart which showcased all the desserts. I assure you, this is much better than looking at a menu but it might also make your choice even more difficult as all the offerings looked delicious. We sampled the creme brulee and the tiramisu and, as expected, they were splendid!  Service was exquisite: polite and attentive just when you needed them without annoying and pretentious interference. I can't stress enough how impressed I was.  If you want to enjoy a good steak dinner in a more than casual atmosphere then The Steakhouse is the place. Not only is the food excellent but the service as well. Couple these with not so unreasonable prices and you have quite possibly one of the best value for money steak houses on the Strip.",

I don't like wet salad that doesn't pick up dressing.  The baked potatoes taste like it is baked.  So many other baked potatoes taste like it is steamed.

I wish they were in a better casino, sad to have to walk through the dumpster fire that is circus circus to get to this gem. I have been here about 5 times and every meal was great. Highly recommend the Ribeye and mashed potatoes.",

The busboy kept our water glasses full, and was attentive as well.    We had dined there many years ago, too many to say.  We had a lovely dining experience than.   It was the draw of a little nostalgia that kind of sent us back.  We hoped for the best, but accepted the possibility that time and age may have descended upon the restaurant.   It is definitely Old School with the dark paneled wood.  The restaurant itself was well maintained and the linens and tablecloth were in good shape, as they should be.  The restaurant is in Circus Circus; the casino definitely shows its wear and tear and could use a bit more than a refresh.   We weren't disappointed at all be the food or service.   I had the porterhouse steak and my wife had the filet.   The salad came chilled and was a generous portion.  We opted to have the salad that comes with the dinner and didn't upgrade to the specialty salad. The bread basket was also very nice; pretzel bread, breadsticks and rolls.  The wine list is not extensive, but sufficient; the pricing is not exorbitant.    We would definitely go back.",

The Steak House at Cirus Cirus was so delicious and cooked to perfection and the bonus there is that you actually get a whole dinner with your entree. Salad, potato, vegetable, Bearnaise sauce and an awesome steak. I upgraded my salad to a Cesar salad for $6.00 and that was equally delicious. I will be returning in a few weeks and that will definitely be one of my dinner stops on the trip. Total bill for one without gratuity $68.00. I typically spent more then $100 plus. My steak was a petite filet. Couldn't finish my meal. Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "I like old school Las Vegas. I had this restaurant on my list to try it for years and now I've been here twice. First, don't let the fact that they are inside Circus Circus discourage you from going. You have to think, they have been in business for so many years that Circus Circus was probably different at the time they opened. Now it is rundown and doesn't have a great reputation but the restaurant isn't too far into the casino. I actually enjoy stopping at the little gift shops on the way!  When you walk in, it's dark and kind of a time warp, which I love. Vintage Vegas! You can see into a meat cooler (I think that is what you would call it) when you're walking to your seat, which could be cool to some. Depending on where you sit, you might even pass a part where you can see chefs cooking.  Both times I ate here, it was very good. One thing that stands out is the french onion soup. They give you all the toppings on the side, so you can add more as you eat it. I love that! I usually only eat French onion soup until the cheese is gone, so this way you can keep eating. It was delicious! The shrimp I got with my steak was also very good. They are big too!  The service has always been great here. Even when you're greeted at the front, they are super attentive. The second time I was there, we were waiting for a minute (no one was at the front) and when the host came back, he apologized and said we should not have been kept waiting. We really didn't mind, it was only a minute. The fact that he apologized was very nice though.",

We didn't have reservations, but did manage to get our party of 5 in around 7:00 pm on a Sunday. We were worried that we weren't very well dressed, but that didn't seem to be an issue. (Dress in the restaurant was varied, from more dressy to business casual to...uh...less casual, as we were!)  My prime rib was very flavorful. Not the very best I've ever had (House of Prime Rib, San Francisco), but it was pretty close.  My dining companions' entrees were equally good (grilled shrimp, salmon, and rib-eye steak).  Desserts were very good as well - my creme brulee was fantastic. The creme brulee sampler was apparently ok, but the plain vanilla flavored was the best of the 4 samples.  The service was great, CHAE was our server, and he was wonderful - thanks!!  They gave us a big tray of Andes mints with our bill.  Yum!  I would definitely come back here.",

The interior is typical, dark steak house but you really do fee like you have been transported back in time. Maybe it was the Sinatra tunes playing. Anyway, the food. The food was amazing. I ordered the New York Strip and boy was is it a strip! I was expecting the size to be about half of what it actually was because I am used to these newer, fancier steak houses getting greedy with portions. Not the case here. I ordered it medium well and it was cooked to perfection. My strip came with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Nice sides but the New York Strip was the star of the show. The place is a little pricey but unlike other steak houses, sides come with the meal and so you don't have to pay a la carte for anything other than your steak.

    "text": "Really OLD SCHOOL vegas here in the ever getting worse Circus Circus hotel the Steakhouse brings back that old Vegas feel.  Can't believe this place is in this location as if it was anywhere else forget about it.   It was however packed on this Friday night.   Arrive early to our 8PM reservation and have a drink in the bar where generous pours are offered. A View of the meat locker where they 21 day age their \"CHOICE\" not Prime steak is interesting as all cuts are done on premise.  The 18 lb Nova Scotia lobster sitting in the window is also a must see.   Finally seated at nice table \"CHAE\" our waiter who has been there 29 years takes care of us all evening.   Start with 2 Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail each $40.00 for 8 pieces brilliantly displayed with ice, lemon and mayo & cocktail sauce with Atomic pure horse radish on the side.  Delicious shrimp.   All entrees include soup or salad,  choice of Garlic mashed, baked potatoe, or wild rice and vegetables.   Salads were ice cold with crumbled blue cheese dressing.  Very nice presentation with fresh lettuce and vegetables.   Entrees:  Giant Fred Flintstone Bone in Prime Rib that was absolutely mouth watering.   The Giant Filet Mignon & Bone In Rib Eye were  good while  the NY Strip was like the prime rib Standouts.  Garlic mashed were excellent while baked potatoe was average.   Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake for desert were excellent as well.   Service some of the best I've seen and price points for food consumed incredible.  Manager Ron Randazzo stopped by to say hello and chat with us after our meal.  Certainly on my surprise places in Vegas and a must go for any traveler. really a treat.",

Comes back a min later we got a table. Which was awesome for them to squeeze us in. The food was out of this World. The white pepper corn sauce was amazing on everything.

The restaurant is nice and clean, waiters were prompt and courteous as would be expected in a fine dining restaurant. I ordered a bone in ribeye and ordered medium rare, I hesitated a bit because I have had experience with getting a medium steak before, but i thought, no this is a well publicized  steak house, surely they know the difference. To my disappointment the steak was medium the waiter did not come around after the delivery of the food so I was unable to tell him and not wanting to hold up the rest of the group, I finished most of the steak. The meat was just ok, they made up for the lack of flavor with the quantity it was a big piece of meat. If you go there and want medium rare make sure you tell the waiter to ask the chief to make sure its medium rare.You might give advice  for the chief that meat (beef) continues to cook after it's taken off the grill.  I'll keep looking for a good steak when in Vegas again.",

The filet came with fresh asparagus and a baked potato(loaded).  My hat goes off to Richard our server who helped make the experience great.  The Circus Circus may get a bad rap in the past.  However, I noticed  it has invested some $$ in cleaning up the casino as we walked through to the The Steak House. If you haven't tried this place you have to give it a chance.

    "text": "Wait a minute, there's actually a good steakhouse at Circus Circus??  My husband mentioned that he had heard about this place through friends and coworkers. Surprisingly, it was supposed to be pretty good. So we decided to come here on a weekday after work, hoping it would be less crowded. I was able to call 2 hours ahead of time to get a reservation. I haven't been to this hotel since I was a kid, but man this place is run down. Definitely the hang out spot for high school kids.   First of all, it is very easy to miss this place. We came early and walked by without even knowing it. They are located across Market Express, between two gift shops (don't remember the names of them). We were lucky enough to get a booth. An hour later, the restaurant was filling up. I heard a couple asking one of the servers if they could sit at a booth, but were told \"no\" because they were \"booked with reservations.\"   Service was pretty good throughout the night. Our servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. As for the food, the menu was very simple. I really like how dinner INCLUDED bread, chef's vegetables, soup or salad, and choice of baked potato, garlic mashed potatoes or wild rice. That's right, no extra charges for these sides! I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon. It was good, but unfortunately not the best that I have had. It was cooked well and easy to cut and enjoy. However, it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted it to be. I guess that was the purpose of the Bearnaise Sauce, which was alright. Usually, I don't eat my steaks with sauces. On the other hand, my husband really enjoyed his Porterhouse. We also ordered Fries Our Way, which FYI, is fries cooked in duck fat. It was nice and crunchy on the outside, but tasted like regular fries to me! For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu. Out server said that they had \"the best one in town.\" Not so sure about that, LOL, but I thought it was still good and not too sweet. Although, I feel like they were a bit stingy with the lady fingers.   Overall, it was a good dinner, so I would definitely consider returning again. They also give you a bunch of Andes after you pay your bill!",

We heard this place was good and all and especially before you enter their is like awards on the wall. But when we walked in it was dark and dead. Their was barley anyone in their. It was five us but when we were sitting down looking at the prices and it was beyond ridiculous. I ordered Salmon and my mother ordered Shrimp both of our plates were over $50 USD. My other family members got steak and when we got our plates we chuckled simply because first of all the amount of food you getting is nothing compared to the price. We live in Hawaii and we know how expensive food is but this was beyond ridiculous. The claims of it being great were seriously just so unTrue. I was like hoping my food taste good but no it was very plain no taste and just no wow factor. Like was a very boring dish of over $60 luckily I didn't end up paying but still it was just terrible. We just never will comeback to a place like this. It's really not worth it and the place is overrated by people who think they are classy because they eat at such restaurant.   FINAL JUDGEMENT   4 STARS---Customer Service 2 STARS---Taste of Food (Iv'e tasted better) 1 STAR-----Pricing (NOT WORTH IT)  3.5 STARS-Cleanse  3.5 STARS-Restaurant Appeal (Old Fashion Classic) 1 STAR-----Claims of Quality (Didn't cut it) 3 STARS---Presentation (It depends on what you order)  RATING AVERAGE:  2.6 STARS (DON'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE) Go elsewhere for steak. I'm giving it a 1 star based on my overall view. Only go if you really want to try.",

    "text": "I was surprisingly pleased with the dinner we had at The Steakhouse a month ago since I arrived with low expectations.  We had originally wanted to try out Gordon Ramsey's steak house when we were in town, but when our friend inquired about reservations for a Saturday night, they were (not surprisingly) fully booked.  When our friend Chris told us he made reservations at this place, I was taken aback since it's been at least twenty years since I stepped foot on the Circus Circus property nor had much of a desire to on this trip.  Oh well, we decided to leave our hesitation behind and try this place out with an open mind.  This restaurant has been around for ages and when we told our taxi hailing guy at Vdara to hail a cab for us to go to Circus Circus, he said it was an excellent choice for a steak dinner and supposedly all the big wig Vegas honchos still dine there.  When we arrived, our friends were at the bar enjoying a few cocktails.  It felt a little dated in there, but more classic than old trendy if that makes any sense.  There was lots of emerald green walls, burgundy booth seats and lots of hunted animal heads decorating the walls nearby.  Our server was attentive and kept our water goblets consistently filled with bottled Arrowhead water at no extra charge.  I liked how the meals were accompanied with soup or salad, baked potatoes or garlic mashed potatoes and a side of veggies. Since the veggies served that night was asparagus, it was accompanied by some yummy Hollandaise sauce on the side.  I opted for the eight ounce filet since that was more than enough for my appetite.  All their steaks are aged for 21 days and when I took my first bite into my steak, I was a very happy girl.  It was seasoned nice and cooked to medium perfection.  I enjoyed my steak so much that it made me glad that reservations at Gordon Ramsey's uber expensive restaurant didn't work out for us.  I also enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes and the asparagus, but the garden salad I had before all of this was just okay.  Overall we had a great meal and I liked how I was able to charge our part of our meal to our room back at Vdara since it was all part of the same corporate umbrella.  My room reservation included a $50 dining credit thanks to making my reservation through AmEx's travel site, so I'm glad it went toward a meal I actually enjoyed.  Would I go back here to enjoy a nice dinner?  I actually would.  For it to be around for as long as it has, it speaks volumes that it can weather the storm in it's not so fancy hotel despite all the other competing, pricier steak restaurants opening up on the ever changing Strip.",

So if you saw a bunch of awesome guys in suits walking by your kids holding their carnival prize stuffed animals, that would have been us.  This place had everything I would expect from a great steak house. The decor is dimly lit very upscale. The staff is very formal and polite. What's also interesting is that the kitchen is actually in the middle of the seating area so you can see the chefs preparing all the food.  The rib-eye I ordered was huge and perfectly cooked medium rare. It had been aged and the taste was amazing. And unlike some other steak houses, the entrees come with salad and your choice of sides.

Though it seems that detail has not slowed down this staple beef slingin' joint.  Beautiful aged steaks and a very simple basic menu. No frills but everything is elegant and delicious. The staff too is pragmatic in their service approach but absolutely dedicated and hospitable. There's really very little to go on about. This is a classy but not stuffy restaurant. Their approach rests upon the theory that if you serve good food in a traditionally attractive setting by a professional food service team... people will come and they will return. Their approach has proven True.  I will return and return again. Good form!",

The steak house is located in Circus circus, not hard to find.As you enter the steakhouse, you could smell the delicious beef grilling, and you can even see the beef hanging in the glass freezer. We were graciously greeted by the GM Ron. I have to say we've have had dinner at many steakhouses, and I have never seen a GM work the room along with his wait staff like Ron. He is an example of True team player and a great manager. We've been coming here for years,because of the hospitality and the fine food.  Chae was our server and he was excellent. He kept our drinks filled and was at our service. Our dinner started off with two cocktails, a lemon drop and a cosmopolitan, which we cutting edge..We had a prawns cocktail, the prawns were fresh and huge. Bread basket came out hot, and what a nice variety of breads. Our bone in ribeye was cooked to perfection, tender, and juicy. Mash potatoes were creamy, and asparagus grilled just right. They even brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle which was very nice. Thank you to Ron and staff for a memorable evening, we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "This was the first time I had stepped foot in Circus Circus since The Adventure Dome opened when I was 15 years old.  I didn't have a reason to come back, except to try The Steakhouse, which had been bookmarked for awhile, but since I'm not a steak aficionado, it had been put on the back burner.   We were seated at the bar for a glass of wine before dinner, our bartender was as old as the building, and I loved it. The decor was straight out of the 80's complete with floral walls, silk flowers and old wood paneling. We were seated in a corner booth, and to continue with the 80's theme, the booth was a lovely maroon color, contrast with the bookshelves above us. This is old school Vegas....not too cheesy.   Bread basket was amazing, full of pretzel rolls (my favorite) and several different types of crackers and dinner rolls. I ordered the Petit Filet medium well, it was delicious. Perfect cut and temperature. What was amazing about this is, your dinner comes with vegetables AND choice of soup or salad, garlic mashed potatoes, rice or baked potato. All of this for $47. This isn't your typical a la carte steak house where your sides will run $10 each.   Our server was great, what I noticed was, they leave you alone! Thank you! I don't need you to ask me every 2 minutes when I have a mouthful of food, if I'm ok. They deliver your food, and let you be.   For the price, you seriously can't go wrong. Good quality food, great service without a celebrity chef name attached or any pretentious people.",

As soon as you walk in, you're transported to a different land than the circus circus Resort. Been going here since I was a little girl & it's never anything short of spectacular. I've always said that it has to be the most underrated & unknown spot in Vegas. Most people do not believe me when I say that this is the must-go-to dinner in Vegas, but they're never sorry and always grateful for the suggestion.   My go to'a are a delicious New York steak & their fat open face crab legs. Yum yum and more yum. But believe me when I say, you cannot go wrong here.",

I also had a special request for a birthday dessert for my mom since it was her Birthday which never came. EPIC FAIL OF LIFE!! Do not be cheap, go to a more expensive steakhouse on the strip  This is an update! I took it from two to one star. I wrote the review while sitting at the dinner table.

You feel like it's a place where a mob hit get confirmed by one of the bosses.  Straight up gangster.    The menu is simple - filet, porterhouse, rib eye, new york strip, lamb and seafood,  Really, going to a place called THE Steakhouse, how could one not get some beef?  No lamb or seafood for me.  The filet was not as tender as a filet should be.  Even though it was overcooked, the cut was still decent.  The ribeye cut however, was prepared much better.  The cut was cooked just as requested and the juicy fatty flavors really shined through.  For a high end steakhouse, the prices are just a hair under the average.  In short, great eats for the coin and a definite recommend vs. the other steakhouse chains that dot the strip.",

It is not on any billboards or phony paid advertisements, instead it is located in a dilapidated legacy era 90s casino-Circus-Circus. The steaks here are aged to perfection, and they are proud of it since it is confidently displayed in the middle of the restaurant for everyone to see. The ambience is nice but not so uptight where you need to have formal attires. Expect to make a reservations a few days before your visit, especially if you plan on attending during the busy holiday season. The servers are friendly, relax and attentive without laying on the thick sales pitch. I love this place and would definitely recommend this steak house to a friend.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited The Steakhouse on 2/18/17 at 8 pm. I was already thrilled that they were able to take us at this time, when initially they did not have anything available until 10 pm! This was our very first time here, but we had heard great things about this place. The old school decor is great, I loved the dark room, the burgundy booths and the green walls.  Our waiter took quite a while to take our order, but we weren't too upset since they did us a favor by taking us at 8 pm anyway. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing, rib eye steak cooked medium rare, baked potato & salad, plus a bottle of wine. We received our salads promptly and they were great! We received our steaks about 30 minutes later and we were in awe at how beautiful the steak looked on the outside, but we were so disappointed on what it looked like on the inside. My steak was served to me well done. It was tough, hard to cut with a knife, and simply too over done. My boyfriend received a better cooked steak, but even his was more on the medium side than medium rare. Our waiter came back to check on us and asked about our steaks and at that time we let him know they were overcooked. He did ask if we wanted to send it back (which I don't know why you would ask that really. I ordered something I technically didn't receive, most places would just take it, apologize and get you a new one).  We let him know that the wait time was just too much at that point to get another one anyway, we didn't want to wait another half hour or so. Honestly at this point I was so sad and disappointed. I wanted a romantic date night with my boyfriend, you know, steak dinner, wine, candlelight, but when you don't get it all, and it comes at a price, it really sucks. $66 dollar steak and I could have gotten a better one elsewhere for less. I really had high hopes! The place is so cool looking, it's surprising it's in such a lackluster casino.  Once we gave up on our meals, our waiter offered a dessert on the house, but unfortunately at that point, no $10-$15 dessert is going to make up for our $132 we spent on 2 overcooked steaks. We just wanted to leave. Our tab for 2 rib eyes, a bottle of wine was $182.00! We would hope we would have at least received a discount, but no dice. It was unfortunate, and I would think this is just a fluke, but I doubt I will return to this restaurant.",

She and I share the steak and a potato all the time. We basically starve ourselves all day so we can enjoy the meal.

Growing up in Las Vegas, with most of my family working in the restaurant industry, I do have a high standard especially for steakhouses.  On a positive note, my steak filet was delicious and the atmosphere was incredible!!  Ok now the reality of the situation, our server was the worst I've ever had. We would have preferred our busser to be our actual server because he was very attentive.  Our server came over to us after 40 minutes of being seated. We noticed he did not have more than 3 other tables. He was very attentive to all the other tables like a real server would be in a fine dining steakhouse.   We didn't know whether to leave or not. After the 40 minutes of being greeted we had to wait even longer to have our order be taken because he rushed to say he was our server and took off before we could say we were ready to order. Although we were more than ready because it took so long!  Overall he did not seem eager to please or show us any attention. Our food came in 10 minutes which was shocking. I don't know whether that was good or not. Because usually in fine dining it takes time to prepare the food as well as enjoy each course and beverage.  After finishing our main course we were eager to order dessert. Taking another 20 minutes for our server to appear, we had enough. He finally seemed to realize how upset we were and offered to give us free dessert, but we did not accept it. We were not willing to wait.  Unfortunately we were not only disappointed by the service, but also the majority of the food.  My husband ordered the twin lobster tail entree. He said it was chewy and overcooked. The side of baked potato and asparagus were not seasoned. His black bean soup was fine, but nothing special.  I almost hope what happened to us was an off night of the restaurant and server because clearly there are great reviews on Yelp.  However we will never go back to try it again. And told friends, family, and tourists this is the last restaurant we would ever recommend.",

Just wish they had more vegetable selection other than asparagus.  I think I had high hopes because I've heard raving reviews of this gem inside The Circus! Maybe I missed the boat, but I wish they would really make this place stand with excellent food.",

But, this is Vegas where some of the best steak is prepared in America.  My steak was grilled medium-rare just like I like it. No complaints.  Seafood appetizers were tasty but not special. In the age of celebrity chefs and gourmet everything, The Steak House has stayed in the 80s.  Let me say it one more time. Every part of the meal was prepared well and table service was good.  Vegas has more to offer steak diners.  Vive Las Vegas! And Bon Appetit.",

My friend had a 1/2 order of shrimp cocktail and got 2 shrimp for $14 and I had a petite prime rib which cost $57. (Which, by the way, is one of the cheapest things on the menu...) The prime rib was just OK but had way too much fat on it - I've had better prime rib in several other steak places and at a cheaper price too. I'm not sure why this place gets such high ratings... the black bean soup was very good but my friend said her French onion soup was way too salty. The pretzel rolls were one of the best things we got. Also, we were not asked if we wanted anything else- just given the bill. Overall way too expensive for what you get - go to fremont street and go to the chart house in the golden nugget - a little cheaper and the food is much better...",

When you order a steak, you also get a salad and side, which is cool, however the salad is clearly pre-made and stored in a very cold fridge. This meant that they served the salad to me at ice-cold temperatures, nearly frozen, which made eating the cucumbers and beets impossible. For the $70 price of the steak, I would expect a non-frozen salad.  Secondly, they have only one bartender to make drinks for the table patrons and the bar patrons, and there is a steady stream of table waiters barking orders at the bartender to get drinks for their tables, making for poor atmosphere and distracted service at the bar.",

Once at the front desk, it is clear this place is a literal time capsule from over 20 years ago. From the red colored booths to the aged lighting fixtures and carpeting, the feel and ambiance was nothing short of old school. I felt like I was going to look over and at some point see Al Pacino. Ok, ok, on to the food...We started with a half dozen oysters in the half shell. Delicious and fresh! Their flavor popped with a little horse radish and cocktail sauce. I had the NY strip with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed and asparagus tied the meal together beautifully. Our server was great and had a sense of humor while still being very professional. If you want a unique dining experience with guaranteed fantastic food, this is the place. Also, they were more than willing to accommodate gluten free which is always appreciated :)",

It's nice that sides are included (starch, veg, soup or salad) - it's always annoyed me to pay $75 for a steak and be asked to kick in another $10 for a potato. This place doesn't do that, which is great.   There's also something to be said for the surreal feeling of being in such a low end casino and turning the corner into a really classy place (old school, but classy).   The reason I'm only giving it two stars is that the steak was really pretty bad. It was just flavorless. And it was a bone in ribeye, so it should have had a ton of flavor.   I could have had a better steak buying one at Costco and throwing it on my Weber grill, and that's not what I expected based on reviews here and elsewhere. There are probably 10 restaurants on the strip that will give you a better value on a good steak than this place. Wish I could give it a better review, but I was genuinely disappointed.",

We spent last new years eve at Las Vegas and for our new years eve dinner, we decided to try The Steak House in Circus Circus Hotel.   I have to say, the place is decent and food is great, totally the opposite of what Circus Circus, which is run down and filled with kids running around. It was busy that night and we're lucky to get last minute reservation especially during new years eve.  The person making reservation was friendly, courteous and accomodating.   Food portion is good. Me and my wife ordered Rib Eye and Porterhouse steak, and it was enough for us and our 2 kids.  The warm bread and butter they serve was good, even the water they served tasted really good, its funny cause both kids commented how good the water was :)   It cost about 40-45 bucks per entree and includes salad and a side order, which I think is reasonable for the size and quality of their steak.  The steak is good and the side order is so-so. Ruth-Chris is better, but of course it cost more and you would have to pony up 10-15 bucks more per side order.",

The interior decor was like a hunting club with stuffed Pheasants and Dear heads mounted on the wall. I tried ordering the Rib eye and they were out. Seriously?? A steak house out of rib eye.. OK.. So then I ordered the Porterhouse, Medium. Got it close to well. My Friend ordered the same, Medium rare. Got it more like ALIVE. The steak itself was nothing I would brag about. Tasted like cooked meat. I don't think I would recommend this place to anyone who wants good steak and/or atmosphere in LV. Try somewhere else. There are many other places in town with better food.",

Maybe we hit this on a bad night, or maybe we were too late for dinner but this had to be one of the worst meals I, ever had.  Let's start with the fact that it's in Circus Circus.   I was waiting for Clark Griswold and cousin Eddie to show up.  What a seedy, dark, dirty and creepy looking casino this is.  Our dinner started with a salad that was soggy and rotting. I ordered a prime rib only to be told by our waiter that there was only one piece left and he wouldn't recommend it.    I ordered a filet, which was very tender but lacking any flavor and was served room temperature and dry.   The asparagus was over cooked and a couple of the spears we missing the tips.    My husbands meal was just as bad, if not worse.    We should have listened to our cabbie who just shook his head, when we told him where we were headed.   This review will probably  get the same canned response the other reviews got.    Goes to show you how much effort they put into this place.    Not worth the trip.

The servers are excellent, very helpful and attentive but not overbearing.  They make an excellent gin martini. I chose the lamb chops for dinner and they were probably the thickest ones I've ever had. They were cooked to perfection, medium for me.  My date had the bone in cowboy rib eye and he was impressed.  He said it was one of the best steaks he ever had.  The dinner salads were even awesome.  This place is not to be missed. I liked it so much I went back for lunch a few days later.",

Your steak comes with a side and a salad, which you will find nowhere on the strip. My steak was cooked perfectly. I have absolutely no complaints about this steakhouse. I tried the peppercorn sauce, but found the steak tasted better without it. There is a reason why it was voted best so many years in a row.

I clearly told them I want a corner both.  that I notice online that are more private. They assured me that will not be a problem. So we had problems since we first got there. they did the opposite and gave me a crowded table right in the middle. And I notice the table that we wanted  was empty for the entire night.. So all things aside let's get to the food. We ordered the salad .famous bean soup ribeye dinner and  filet mignon dinner. Salad hardly had lettuce but the  blue cheese and vinaigrette dressing was good. Your famous bean soup just tasted like ordinary black beans in a can... The steaks were nothing special I don't see how it so post to be award winning the steaks were very bland  steaks were not season what so ever before cooking on the grill no salt no black pepper no garlic etc. As soon as I took a bite out of the stake I knew something was wrong to my amusement it was not season so I grabbed a salt shaker on the table and they filled it so it not want to come out .so I did not want to go to the hassle of opening it and all that stuff when the stake should of been season from the beginning. Steaks were a decent size but they were tasteless. On to the service our waiter was not professional at all seemed like he kept rushing us . He did not refill our drinks we had to ask for a refill at the very end of our dinner. I don't think that's right that we have to ask for a refill  at a fancy steak restaurant. Are cup was empty pretty much all the way throught.On to desert they told me over the phone they will give me a compliment cheesecake which they did not give to me  !!!!!  so I warn everybody there is nothing special about this steakhouse waste of the money stake is not flavored whatsoever got o ellis island steak dinner much better 8 dollars at least they season ...",

However, they serve the best steak in Las Vegas.  The staff have been fantastic every time I've eaten there and the food is always delicious. Lots of care is taken to make sure that everything is just the way you want it. For example, they were able to pull off a filet mingon cooked \"well done\" (normally considered heresy in a steakhouse). It arrived at the table just as tender as a filet mingon that was cooked medium rare. Thats a testament to the quality of their meats and the skill of their kitchen staff.  Check this place out the next time you are in Las Vegas.",

Make a reservation, get there early, or maybe wait a few minutes for your tablet.  Head to the bar and get a nice classic cocktail, manhattan being my favorite, and take in the atmosphere with old school red bar seats.    The meat here is 21 day aged beef on site, and you can see your meat when you walk in.  You'll then notice the grill, which is in the center of the restaurant, making your mouth ready to water.  Sit down and order a dozen or half dozen oysters, not always the best but always good enough.  Their servers are all mostly old schoolers too as well, and they know what they're doing.  Get a bone in ribeye or filet mignon, rare to medium rare, and sit back and wait for your salad.  The salads are good, as is the black bean soup, which comes with a shot of sherry.  French onion is usually too salty so not one of my favorites.  The main event is the meat, and it has yet to disappoint.  The flavor of the char and soft warm center melds together like a well rehearsed tango in your mouth.  You will be stuffed, yet you will savor every bite.  Top 3 authentic old school steakhouse in Vegas, with the lowest prices ($50-75 per person).",

We love going to steak houses but this was a miserable experience and that's putting it nicely! The service was awful, especially for an expensive steak house. We each had 1 cocktail only because our server never came back to see if we wanted another. We each ordered steaks, a ribeye and a porterhouse. They tasted like NOTHING. A plain, very dry steak!!! Not worth the money at all! The entire time we were eating the server did not check in us even one time. We were done eating for 20 min, at least, before he came and gave us the check. No offer of dessert either. We were clearly irritated and never saw a manger. I have worked I. The service area a long time and this is not the type of service you receive from a very expensive establishment. $200 we will never get back. Do not go here!!!",

I have heard from many people how good the food was and so went there hoping that the  Circus Circus restaurant would be a hidden gem.  Instead what I found was a beautiful old time steak house with red booths and gleaming brass. The steaks are cooked right in middle of dining room.  My crab cake was very good and so I expected that the steak would be great.   Instead of a great steak (I ordered porterhouse) I got something that was more like the meat I would expect to buy at a grocery store.  Last week at Baltaire in LA , I had perhaps the best steak I have ever eaten. Then I realized that all  the newer steak houses have upped the game on prime steaks. Unfortunately this restaurant continues to order old time and not so good meat   Back in the day Las Vegas restaurants were very beautiful but they did not serve great food. Nothing has changed here.  The service was good, the decor perfect but I gave it 2 stars because the meat is not as good as most other steak houses.",

    "text": "I went here back in June for restaurant week. This place is excellent to visit during restaurant week because of the great deal they offer.  You may think that Circus Circus doesn't have anything to offer but you are wrong. The steakhouse has an old time Vegas feel and is probably the best thing that the casino has to offer and the reason it stays open.  Our service was great! And she was from Buffalo as well which is always cool to talk to people from the same hometown.   For $50 you were able to get French Onion soup or salad, Filet Oscar and your choice of dessert. Considering the filet is normally over $50 this is an amazing price.  I decided to go for the french onion soup over the salad. Even though it was summer and very hot out I can never refuse french onion soup. It was very tasty and filling.  The filet oscar was awesome. For those who don't know oscar style is filet with crab meat on the top along with a sauce. This came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were so good. I had leftovers that I made sure to eat the next day! I didn't finish my meal mainly because I had to leave room for dessert  For dessert I went with the chocolate cake. It was a big toss up between that and the chocolate covered strawberries but the cake won. It was so good! It was a large piece so I was able to take some of that home too.  The only downfall was that everything was served too close together. I like when things are brought out with a bit of a wait in between so you are able to digest before your next course comes around. The soup and main course came so close together that by the end I felt so full I almost opted for dessert to go.   I was so glad I was able to enjoy this during restaurant week. Great food for a great deal. For those who go at anyother time of the month it's a great steakhouse but with being a great steakhouse comes cost. It's probably average price for a steakhouse but more than I normally spend on a meal.",

Homemade black bean soup was outstanding and sweetened to your specific flavor preference. Steak (ribeye) was above average but not as good as my prior experiences at this restaurant. THE steakhouse remains on my list of top steakhouses and a must-have when you're in town.",

    "text": "This review is for THE Steak House's 2015 Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu.  No clownin' around here (ha ha). Circus Circus'  THE Steak House has won me over.  First Course - Appetizer - House Salad: I don't even know why I'm writing about the salad because you don't make friends with salad, as Homer J. Simpson once said. Let me be real: the salad was basic. Red onion slices, carrots, mushrooms, and greens. I ordered a vinaigrette dressing on the side, which had the perfect tanginess.  Second Course - Entree - Filet Oscar: If you're expecting several carnivorous offerings, sorry, but the Filet Oscar is the only slab of meat that they're offering for Restaurant Week, which to me is fine. The thick 8oz filet was topped with chunks of king crab with a generous serving of creamy hollandaise poured all over. For my side, I selected wild rice over the mashed potatoes; asparagus was the Chef's Choice veggie of the evening.   Third Course - Dessert - Chocolate Covered Strawberries and Creme Brulee: \"These strawberries are wearing Armani tuxedos, not tuxes from JC Penny,\" my server said to me - gotta love the humor. The chocolate covered strawberries were created to look as though they're \"wearing\" tuxedos. Cute and sweet. My mom and I shared creme brulee, which was fantastic.  Service: Excellent.   Overall: THE Steak House is so good that I would make the drive to Circus Circus -- that's saying a lot. Whether it's during Restaurant Week or any other week of the year, I still recommend that tourists and locals give this steakhouse a shot.",

Here is the breakdown:  Black bean soup is first rate and as everyone says it's the best.  Steak was a strip cooked perfectly. It was not overly seasoned or salty and I think a good steak stands on its own. This one was great. Mashed potatoes were first rate.  Baked potato was not great. Very average. I ordered it and wish I got something else Asparagus was good, average except my wife's portion was small. Should have complained but didn't.  We had great martinis - standard for a steakhouse.  We had a wonderful slice of chocolate mousse cake. It was excellent.  Best of all service was A+ as Roberto and his helper were prompt and helpful throughout the meal.   Lots of steakhouse competition in Vegas and they are all expensive. This one was excellent and for the money a real value for what you get.",

    "text": "I see The famous Steakhouse every year because I usually stay at Circus Circus...it's on the way to the main casino and has been there since I was a kid. I made a promise to my daughter that I would take her for dinner.  We just left The Steakhouse and I would like to say that it far exceeded my expectations. It is dimly lit but very elegant. From the moment you walk in, you can tell you will be in for a treat. First we were served a basket filled with different types of bread and butter. My favorite were the raisin bread but they were all delicious.  The first course was black bean soup however, you can choose a salad if you don't want the soup. It was absolutely delicious. I ordered the chicken breast..it comes perfectly grilled, well seasoned and very tender. It came with grilled asparagus and a baked potato. You can get mashed potatoes too. I read a review below stating the meat was under seasoned, I disagree with that review. Why would the chef ruin a fine cut of meat by over salting it and ruining the natural flavor? I think the meat tasted delicious and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper.  My daughter got the rib eye steak..I wish I had taken a photo of it, it was spectacular.  The server was very polite and and took care of us good. Service is exceptional. A tray of delicious deserts were offered to us after our meal however, we were stuffed. The options were chocolate covered strawberries, cheesecake and a whole tray full of delicious options.  There is a great variety of wine and appetizers too.  You will be very pleased if you come here. It is worth every penny. Food is well seasoned and service is excellent, I highly recommend it here.",

    "text": "I first learned about this place in this old \"Little Black Book\" by David de Montmollin.  Basically an amusing read on a Vegas insider's recommendation for the ultimate Vegas weekend.  Circus Circus is not a casino one would think of going to these days, given the rise of the upscale Wynn, City Center, and Bellagio.  However, it has two nice features - a half-price ticket booth that's not super busy and a phenomenal steakhouse.  The steakhouse has an aging room where you see various cuts of meat and a central kitchen open area where they cook meats on a charcoal grill.  The inside is dark, intimate and classy - but you can wear business casual.  Waiters were super friendly.  The red leather booths we had were really comfortable as well.  Our dinner was excellent - everything cooked well and full of flavor.  Portions were truly massive so I would recommend sharing an entree. The wife and I both got bone-in ribeyes which had a nice smoky crust followed by a tender interior.  Their peppercorn sauce is like a spicy gravy that made the dish even better.  We also got black bean soup which had sides of diced red onions and sherry - very unique flavor but I really liked it.  For dessert, we shared the banana foster which came in a nice martini glass - not a whole lot of alcohol, but real fresh bananas and the ice cream had good layering of caramel.  I do recommend this restaurant - pretty good value.  Even though its $59 for a huge bone-in ribeye, it comes with your choice of starch (rice pilaf, garlic mash, baked potato), asparagus, and choice of salad or black bean soup.  Be sure to ask for peppercorn sauce on the aide and save room for dessert!",

    "text": "Update:  I was being generous at giving 3 stars because of the service. But clearly my photos taken establishes my \"rare\" steak to be over cooked in comparison to my wife's \"rare\" steak. However, the ineptitude of the MGM marketing person is either blind to social sarcasm or is immune to my generosity in spite of their inferior cooked meat. I, normally, do not downgrade any restaurant because of one small thing or another to be fair.  However, this is your speciality. Your reason for being. Ironically our company booked over 1200 rooms and all the ballrooms for our meetings last month at the Bellagio. While I may not particularly like aged meat, my wife does. I know what good aged meat is supposed to taste like as much as I know what good Mexican food tastes like. I don't care for either one as a personal choice but I do eat them. Instead of apologizing they spin it into a taste not to my liking when the underlying cause was their overlooked meat. Anything over cooked is not going to taste good. I am just glad I used Restaurant Week to try them out versus going during regular time periods or else I would be furious. Mistakes I can fathom but inept ignorance is unforgivable. By the way, MGM Marketing, we had a catered lunch for our employees today.  At times I could go ballistic if my meat comes out crappy. However since this was also my anniversary I kept my cool. There are plenty of steak houses in Vegas. I never had any complaints at McCormicks down the street on Paradise/Flamingo.  Since the marketing persons response seems condescending I decided to give them a 1 star even though the restaurant itself deserved more. Service is always a important factor as much as the food.  --------  I finally went to this steak house after hearing about it through the years and reading my Yelp friends reviews. It is an old fashioned steak house as is its reputation. The place is decorated with old charm, red stuffed leather seating, bankers green and gold lamps. You are greeted at the entrance by the glass enclosed aging room next to the hostess station. Petra greeted me and was the same one who took my reservation at 2pm. We went at 7:30 and she was already turning people without reservations away or letting them know the slots open were after 9pm.  We ordered the Restaurant Week menu. I had house salad, petite filet, and chocolate mousse cake. Water is served via bottle. Bread rolls were brought out very quickly. They were a varied lot consisting of cheese sticks and different rolls. The salad was very good. I cannot recall what was in it though. The filet came out medium rare and not rare that I wanted. They got the better half's meat right. Some pieces of crab meat in sauce laid on top of the meat. Baby asparagus on the side. I chose wild rice as the other accoutrement. It was wild and al dente. I am not Italian so I usually eat my rice cooked, al fully cooked. But I don't mind. It gave a nice texture. It had small chopped mushrooms, along with the wild seed looking things that a whole foods eater would be accustomed to. I am not in the fancy wild rice crowd.  The meat was good. The rare was cooked buttery, from my better half's plate. Not a fan of aged meat to be honest. A nicely cooked ribeye would have been better.  The chocolate mousse cake was one of the best I've eaten. Very velvety and just the right amount of sweet. It was more than I could handle so we shared one and took one slice to go. We didn't even finish the one we started on.  The service was too notch. They were very attentive and quick. I felt bad seeing how they had to walk up and down the stair as well as seeing the busboy lift a whole tables worth of dirty dishes and glasses in one sling.  What can I say? It was good but I don't think I will go back again.  I don't see a hankering to go back to this or another aged steak house. Kind of like Ruth's Chris. This is better than them but I tried it and that was pretty it. I rather go back to a sushi restaurant or have a $20 prime rib. McCormick and Schmicks does better steaks IMO. Aged meats only taste good if cooked correctly. Everyone was working hard including the poor guy who had to fire up all the steaks. He seemed like a pro, feeling the meats temperature as they cooked and adjusting. He seemed way too tall for the cooking station tho.  The clientele were mostly silver foxes...my parents and grandparent types. The hostess said we were very young and we pretty much were the youngest people there. So all in all, a classy quaint place. Now I can tell my dad that I've eaten at his favorite steak house and I am not that impressed to be honest.",

I couldn't believe that Circus Circus could have a great steakhouse so near to the petri dish that is their buffet.  This place would get 5 stars but I ordered the Porterhouse rare (blue rare) and received a medium to medium/well steak. When I told the waiter that it was overcooked he argued with me and pulled out a flashlight. I understand that it was dark.. but I know the difference between rare and medium.  Anyways the second steak they brought was cooked perfect.",

The maitre d Ron always is very nice and always remembers us and take great care of us! The steaks are unbelievable awesome! I always have the petite filet mignon and my husband has the porterhouse! Both are always perfectly cooked! For apps we get oysters on a half shelf ! We both get casears salads. I can't say enough good stuff about the this place the only thing I wish is that it was not in Circus Circus its a very long walk from valet or parking garage in heels!",

I mean.. better than good but it didn't change my life or anything like that. I ordered the filet and a Cesar with a side of rice and shrooms. All very good. I would go again but I still prefer the Golden Steer. The staff was great and that was a surprise. Often places like this you get marginal service because inside the Casino they figure you are from ??? and won't be back. The bartender was cool as it gets and the servers were very much on their game! I will repeat.",

    "text": "Everything was great except the steak.  Excellent atmosphere, very good salad and side dishes.  But the bone in ribeye was poor.  First flavor that hits you is the charcoal grill - especially if the steak has some charring.  Second a quality cut of ribeye should not have as much unmelted grizzle as this one did.  Third I requested medium to medium rare temp and it  was closer to rare but it was too busy to send back.  I didn't complain - just knew it was my last trip here.  My advice would be to spend a couple bucks on cabfare and go to Golden Steer.  Their ribeye is the best I've had in Vegas.",

The restaurant is like its steak, aged and vintage. You are greeted by a display case of their aged cuts of meat, that will either A) Make carnivorous folk drool in anticipation or B) Make you wonder why are you staring at old aged raw meat and totally turns you off... I am the former so I was already ready to dig into a nice porterhouse.  I got a nice juicy, flavorful cut, and the service was great. Price is a bit steep, but you pay that much for a decent cut. My only complaint is it's location... This steak place is the only reason I'd want to go to the Circus Circus, and that more often then not is not enough reason for me to go there compared to all these other great casinos and restaurants.  -Ed",

For entree, it was the filet mignon.  One of the best steaks that I've ever eaten.  My father had lobster tail.  Again very good.

I came here with my roommate and a couple of our friends from Michigan. We got a ridiculous deal because my roommate is buddies with one of the managers, Felix. Definitely say hi to him if you visit because he will make you feel right at home. We started off with red wine and the seafood sensation appetizer. Both were fantastic. Nothing too complicated--just top notch seafood.   I got the petite filet which was amazing. Great flavor, perfectly done, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sides matched the quality of the steak which I can't say about the sides at Binion's Steakhouse.   Desserts were OK. We ordered tiramisu, chocolate cake, and cheesecake between the four of us. We were pretty full at that point so we didn't finish everything. Best out of those three was probably the cheesecake because that's the one I remember the most. I've had better tiramisu and chocolate cake elsewhere.   Overall we had a great experience and I definitely recommend it. Ambiance is old-school classy and very welcoming. Our waiter was warm, helpful, and friendly but professional at the same time.   I still have so many restaurants to try in the city but I definitely want to come back here!!!",

It's rare to find a nice steak house that doesn't sell the sides separately. The asparagus was just okay, but the mashed potatoes were delicious!   My fiance ordered the black bean soup to start and it was pretty good. For his entree he had the Bone in Rib Eye. It was very tender, but too fatty for my taste. That's why I always stick to the Filet.   We shared Tiramisu and chocolate covered strawberries for dessert. The Tiramisu was good but the strawberries were amazing.

    "text": "After hearing about The Steak House at Circus Circus for more than 20 years, Restaurant Week gave me the excuse I needed to finally visit the place and appraise it. And, after doing so, while I do not consider it to currently be the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, I was impressed. Rather than being the cowboy steak joint I sort of expected, this was a classy dining establishment with serious steaks, professional service, and an upscale enclosed dining room. Not everything was executed perfectly but everything I witnessed was executed well.   The large dining room that featured fancy multi-hued fabric chairs and comfortable, red leather booths was filled to capacity early on a Thursday night. I was very glad that my party of four had a reservation. The room contained several lit lamps but it was still very dark inside.   Buttered raisin bread was a tasty start to a fine meal overall. A white crock of French Onion Soup was hot and had nicely melted cheese on top as well as well-caramelized onions inside, but the dark broth was very salty and a bit harsh tasting at first. Yet, as I dug in deeper with my soup spoon, and got near the bottom of the vessel, the broth tasted much sweeter, and I liked it.  While the onions were numerous, I found no melted croutons in the midst of the broth, and missed them. But, now I realize that this was my own fault. For, a photo of my soup reveals that several hard croutons rested right next to my crock. All I had to do was dump them in. Pity that I overlooked that when it mattered!   The large Steak House Salad consisted of just a few types of mixed greens, plus grape tomatoes, and slices of mushrooms, carrots, and cucumbers. An excellent thick and creamy Blue Cheese Dressing made the taste buds come alive.   Then came the piece de resistance that I was waiting for the most: a 12-oz. Filet Mignon prepared Oscar style with King Crab, asparagus spears, and a generous amount of Bearnaise Sauce ladled over the top. The steak wasn't the best I ever tasted but it was probably in the top ten.  It was cooked medium rare as ordered; it did melt in the mouth once I reached its middle; and I found it to be well seasoned and tender throughout with no noticeable char. It had been beautifully prepared on the grill above white-hot burning mesquite wood by a chef who clearly knows how to cook premium beef to order, as other steaks at my table were cooked medium and medium well as ordered, with everyone pleased with their entree. The crab and Bearnaise Sauce were also of high quality. Only the spears of asparagus were lacking in appearance and flavor; they were undistinguished thin, green--or in some cases yellow-tinged--reeds. My Baked Potato was good but not soft all the way through on the inside.  It could have benefited from a few more minutes in the oven.   The large array of included desserts from the Chef's Pastry Cart were first rate. Chocolate Mousse Cake with chocolate shavings was dense and luscious. And a novel Bananas Foster that was self-contained in a martini glass was very fine, replicating all of the elements of the more common flambeed variety. Cut pieces of banana, melting vanilla ice cream, and the requisite liqueur all mixed together very well to create a tasty sauce and a memorable dessert.  The only untoward moment was when my wife, Diane, mistook for a Pirouette Cookie an inedible cinnamon stick that was lodged in the Bananas Foster, and almost broke a tooth!   The meal as a whole was a solid 4-1/2-star experience. An oasis of fine dining does indeed reside inside Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.",

    "text": "I wanted to love THE Steak House. Supposedly great steaks in an almost historic setting, at a somewhat reasonable price level, since you get decent sides with any order. I thought we would give them a try, instead of going to Prime as usual.  We had a filet mignon and two porterhouse steaks.  The filet was serviceable but nothing special.  The porterhouse steaks looked impressive, but also had an odd butterfly look, and were quite thin on the strip side. We had ordered medium rare for both, but the filet side showed up as medium or more, and the strip side was medium/well-done.  Both steaks had a lot of hard internal fat, and seemed entirely without flavor. Overall they seemed like the kind of random steaks you might pick up at a supermarket you haven't been to before. Not even close to Prime quality. This was Select at best.  Service was slow, disinterested, but polite. We asked for some sauces, thinking they must have some nice sauces to help the steaks. The waiter said sure and returned with steak sauce and hot sauce bottles. I see now after the visit that they have pepper corn and cheddar cheese (?) sauces \"available upon request\". Well, we did in fact request sauces for the steaks. Had I known this at the time, I would have called the manager for an explanation. I mean, why are we paying north of $200 for bad steaks and industrial steak sauce, like we were in some dingy dinner?  I have only once in my life returned a food order. I prefer to just not come back, and avoid making a fuss. However, this time, literally feeling unwell after ingesting overdone subpar meat mixed with hard gelatinous fatty stuff, I did severely regret not sending it all back to the kitchen.  Not sure what happened here. Perhaps our waiter took an immediate dislike to our small party, which included a young child, and sent us the worst steaks he could find in inventory.  However, other reviews mention flavorless steaks.  In short, the Steak House needs to seriously rethink their approach to being a steak house. In the meantime, I would avoid at all cost.",

I found myself disappointed, especially given the number of options for steak in Las Vegas.  A friend and I dined here; I had the porterhouse, he the main filet, both medium rare.  The ingredient quality was good and the temperature was right, but generally the steaks were not flavorful and had no crust.  Clearly there are many styles of preparation and not all will be seasoned or have a crust, but that is my expectation for an American-style steakhouse, which the Steak House is clearly trying to achieve.  Ambiance was good, classic decor, red leather booths.  Service was excellent, I think the waiter's name was Mitch.",

For dinner, I ordered the petite filet (medium) with garlic mashed potatoes and chef's choice of vegetable (carrots)....paired with house Cab.  Meat was cooked perfectly along with the carrots.  The garlic potatoes were excellent.    Dessert was sampler of creme brulee, basically 4 small squares:  plain, strawberry, raspberry and chocolate.

    "text": "This is a very different restaurant from the type we normally select in Las Vegas. Everything screams out \"old school,\" from the waiters to the red vinyl booths. You are not going to find any molecular gastronomy on the menu, nor can you expect to pay those types of prices. But if you are looking for a great value for a simple steak cooked to your liking, it is hard to beat what The Steak House has to offer.  For starters, both my wife and I chose the house salad with an Italian vinegar etre. The salad was quite large, and full of fresh, crispy vegetables. The dressing was tangy but not overly sweet. For the main course, my wife chose the lobster tail, while I opted for the \"petite\" cut of prime rib. This was my first mistake of the evening. Actually, two mistakes: one was that I ordered the prime rib cooked medium well, which as everyone knows is just a rookie move. The second was that I assumed \"petite\" meant...well, small. The huge slab of beef that was set on my plate threatened to topple over the table. Since I'm not someone who can eat a huge amount of cow at one sitting, I barely made a dent in my plate. This leads me to suggest that sharing a meal at The Steak House might be a viable option, assuming you can agree on what to order and how you like it cooked.  We finished up our meal with quite possibly the best coffee I've had at a restaurant. A perfect ending to what was a good (not great) meal. I can definitely see the appeal of The Steak House, but I think the Zagat score of 28 is awfully high.",

The service. The steak. Everything was 5 star. Amazing. Quiet, Classic. Total high class upper 1% of steakhouses in the world. It's authentic, classic, and everything is original. I felt like I was taken back to a different era.   It's dark. Dim. Perfect lighting. Exactly how a classic steakhouse should be. The steaks are cooked over two huge charcoal grills in the middle of the steakhouse. You can see your steak being cooked. They have a suction vent sucking all the smoke from the middle but the coals crackle and pop and the air is permeated with the amazing smell of large salt and pepper seasoning on grilled steak.   The steaks are also dry aged in the steakhouse for days or months under perfect climate controlled conditions. You can see the steaks behind the glass. Their wine list, while not extensive, is almost perfectly selected. I would only ask they add Shiraz or some more expensive wines by the glass to the menu.   I have been to many steakhouses in Vegas and this is the #1 Steakhouse in my opinion. They are probably refusing to pay publicists or journalists in the media which is why you rarely see media raving about them expect in Zagat magazine which they have been ranked #1 for 30 years and I can see why.   They could easily double or triple their prices would it not be they were located in the Circus Circus Casino.",

Our salads were good but the dressing on mine was so heavily laden with vinegar that I could not eat it.  I even asked for blue cheese dressing to add to my salad in the hopes I could salvage it but that was also a fail.  My husband was fine with his salad and he enjoyed his steak which was prepared correctly.  Mine was not prepared as I requested but I did not send it back (I should have).  The lobster tail was the real problem.  I noticed when the waiter pulled it from the shell to serve it to me that it looked very tough and charred (the restaurant is very dark so it was hard to see).  I took a bite and could barely chew it.  Bottomline, it should not have left the kitchen and should have never been served.  I sent it back and they brought another.  It was prepared correctly but lacked flavor.  I don't think it was fresh at all.  For the price of this meal, I should have sent my entire meal back but I didn't because I did not want my husband to have to wait on me.  Kudos to the front of the house host for coming to the table and apologizing and they did end up removing the lobster tail from our bill.  The restaurant did insist that we take a dessert with us (chocolate mousse torte which was delicious) on the house BUT as a result of this experience, we will probably try other steakhouses the next time we visit Vegas.  This was a huge disappointment for us because we always eat here and look forward to it.  This was suppose to be our dinner to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  Our visit this time was memorable for all the wrong reasons.",

The ambience is that of a traditional old school steakhouse. I fondly remember going to these types of places with my grandfather.  Even the service was awesome, people were constantly refilling our water glasses and checking in on us.   I had a petite filet and everything that came with it.  It was tasty and delightful to eat. I don't get steak very often so this was a treat to have.  The dessert cart was great too but on second thought if you're a chocoaholic you should try the chocolate mousse cake for sure.  It's a must and thanks to my father I had a bite of it.  The chocolate dessert I had wasn't as good.   As people have said, walking into Circus Circus you wouldn't expect a great restaurant like this.  If you're at this end of the strip, this steakhouse is a MUST.",

The Steakhouse is legit, fully equipped with white tablecloths, dark wood, dim but sufficient lighting, without the pretense of the typical Las Vegas big boobed hostess with cleavage hanging out of her LBD.  The rib eye was succulent and seasoned just right to complement and let you taste the meat.  They offered a spiced sauce, but it's a crime to use it.  The steak with plain asparagus and wild rice is simple but very well executed.",

There was always a new steakhouse to try or it was just the fact that we didn't want to venture in to \"Clown Town\" unless we had to. This last boys trip we decided to go retro and give the old girl a try. She did not disappoint. The place was packed with diners and it had the cool old Vegas feel to at as soon as you walked in. Most of the wait staff has been there since the day they opened including the bartenders. The decor, vintage 80's brass, green marble and cherry. The unique mesquite wood broiler smoke wafts through the air wetting your appetite for a great steak. The shrimp cocktail was the best I've ever had in Las Vegas with lighter horseradish sauce that delights. I didn't get a pic because we ate is so fast we forgot. Every dish was a winner and the prices are fantastic. Half of what you might spend at Prime in Bellagio and others. Great food, fun, and service in the most Vegas of ways.",

I had the larger filet and my wife had the chicken. The nice thing is the entree's come with choice of potato and a vegetable (asperagas) . I should have asked beforehand and asked for another choice!  Like I said, the steak was good and cooked right. It came with a side of bernaise sauce, which is not my thing. The steak was like $67 and my wife's chicken was $40. My wife is a very picky eater, but loved the chicken. We both ordered the onion soup which was like $12 each... it was good and I polished it off, my wife said it tasted funny and did not finish it. One thing that I thought was odd was that the entrees come with either a house salad or bean soup...we did not receive a discount for the onion soup and were not offered the salad (or bean soup). The bill with tip came to $150. One thing to note... this is inside Circus Circus, so there were many kids inside and it was a bit noisy. The best steak I have ever had was at Prime inside Bellagio... but that was a $400 tab!!",

They charge a $20 upgrade if you want to split an entree and get an extra salad and potato but we didn't need that he said. Also said if we did want it later he could add it. The king crab legs where awesome and fresh. The cocktail sauce was amazing. We ordered the 16 oz NY strip and we where looking for the flavor we find back home at Jeff Ruby's or Tony's....it just wasn't there. We ordered Medium and it was cooked to perfection. The meat had some gristle in it and the flavor was from the grill and not the meat. Overall we enjoyed and would recommend...just can't give it 5 stars because of the steak flavor (meat itself....not seasoning).",

The Circus Circus seemed well kept on its Interior, not smoky or dingy, We were Well Surprised!

After Waiting 40mins to Order Our Food Came Out in 10mins Or Less(Not Sure How I Feel About That, Both A Good & Bad Thing?!?)

Have asked for white Moscato drink, bananas Foster dessert as my app, a large filet rare, baked potato with butter and bacon. Moscato is really good. Have to sit at bar stool area since no other choice is available. I am determined to refresh my great food memories of this beautiful spot in a most unsuspecting environment of lots kids circus, carnival entertainment. Always a big surprise for new diners!! So...dinner was excellent. Filet about inch and three quarter thick. Good enough there. Tender was excellent. The shrimp were overlooked and missed my table. Oh well. Nothing missed likely. Overall still a favorite here and I'll be back, with friends next visit. Gtyup Brian attended all requests very well.",

Not even close! My bone in rib eye was incredibly fatty. Really nothing special here unless you have a penchant for nostalgia and have lots of money to waste.",

A bug ran across the table and when pointed out to the busboy, he \"scuffed\" it with his breadcrumb scrapping tool, scooting it onto the floor removing the creatures legs in the process.  Those stayed on our table for the meal. He walked off and spoke to our waiter, who spoke to who I assumed was the manager, but this event never was acknowledged.  We ordered 3 steaks one well done, two medium rare, and lamb chops well done, the lamb came out 15 mins after our steaks. I ordered the big cut prime rib, of which maybe 20% was great meat, the rest was either fat, or gristle, unfortunately my wife's undercooked ribeye was on par with the amount of digestible content as my prime rib. The waiter dropped off the check thanking us for dining with them, and kept moving. We paid our bill, with the tip reflecting the level of service.  Take your money to a real steakhouse, not this circus act.",

    "text": "So, my dad wanted to go here for Father's day and what kind of son would I be to tell him that he was picking an obviously inferior Vegas strip steakhouse? I will say that this place is better than I was expecting and while it's still nowhere close from the top strip steakhouses (which is hard to visualize when this is 4 stars and they are 5), there just isn't a lot to knock about this place.  It's certainly of a particular style of steakhouse let's get that straight. It has NOT changed with the times at all. It's decor is atrocious but hey it's part of the theme of the restaurant and it works, old fashioned all the way.  My dad claims we used to go there when I was an infant and so when he says it hasn't changed one bit, from the way it looks I believe him.  Ultimately though the food is pretty good. Nothing will blow your mind and nothing will make you say I wanna come back for that specific thing. The menu is uninspiring and you could probably guess off the top of your head 80% of the menu items because they are classic steakhouse staples and nothing more. All of this sounds fairly negative but really since the entire theme of the restaurant is to take you to a different time for steakhouse dining, surprisingly it works.  -Caesar salad. Run of the mill typical caesar salad which isn't a horrible thing. Won't blow you away but should meet your expectations for what a caesar is.  -Filet and Rib eyes. Honestly both are very good. Dry aged and seasoned well they are good pieces of meat. Again you won't be going nuts over them and there are no absurd toppings to put on them (this is one of the only times when my dad asks for A1 to go along with a 60 dollar steak I haven't cringed), but they are very good.  -Cheesecake. I mean the cheesecake was really good. Tasted great. Again it's no fancy cheesecake. There's no liquid nitrogen frozen mint on it, no fruity reductions. It's a slab of cheesecake. A good slab but a standard one.  I don't know how this place is even still open. It doesn't seem like it's ever busy and since there are now 15 reviews for it on yelp I feel like nobody goes here.  But it's still trucking away and at the end of the day if I happen to be in the Circus Circus (and Idk why I would ever do that to myself) and I'm hungry, there are worse places to stop by for a meal.",

Perhaps this is what gives it its 1980 character?  The food- steak is not dry aged for long. It is not terrible, but since I am from NY I am use to real steak from Peter Lugers. Perhaps if I did not compare this place to Lugers, I would think it was ok at best. The crembrule was not freshly made, no attention to detail.  Wedge salad was best part of dinner.   I am not saying don't go here I am saying if you like the outback, you will love this place. If you are a steak person and know what a real dry aged steak is- you will be dissatisfied.",

Therefore, we made reservations. When we arrived, we were seated promptly. An elderly gentleman, Mike, was our waiter and he was superb. The staff were all very attentive, asking how our food was and refilling our waters, without continuously interrupting our conversations. (The water that they serve is purified bottle water, not tab, by default. FREE! It's a plus in my book.)  Splitting the caesar salad and filet mignon, with a glass of Merlot, was about $100 (excluding tips). The caesar salad was good (with anchovies, the traditional way). The filet was asked to be grilled to medium-rare, it perfectly cooked, juicy, and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. The mash was good, but the asparagus was a tab bit overcooked.   THE Steak House keeps it simple, with no more than 15 items to choose from. However, the food is made right and the service is impeccable.",

Porterhouse steak ($48) was a nice, big cut that would most definitely satisfy any man's craving for meat. I think the prime rib was another popular choice that many diners opted for.   The Steakhouse is worth a try in my opinion.",

    "text": "I'm not sure if I just came on an off night or what, but we came to celebrate my birthday after reading all the great Yelp reviews. Maybe it just wasn't what I expected after reading all the Yelpers raving about this place. Had reservations for 7 and was seated immediately on arrival.   The place is dark and the decor is oldish looking. Maybe they were going for the antique look? it just looked old to me. Upon walking in past the reception desk we were taken past a raised cooking area where the chefs cooked the steaks. We were seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. Seat in the booth was comfy.   The service was good. Wait staff kept our waters filled with bottle water and checked on us often. Bread basket was good. The butter was cold and hard as rock when it first got to the table. :/ As for the salad well. It was a salad. That was fine. From my meal, the things I liked most was the French onion soup and garlic mashed potatoes. Those were very yummy. The steak fell very short of what I expect from a great steak. I hold Ruth Chris as my absolute favorite place for steak. I have also been to Morton's (in Hawaii) and Gallager's (in the NYNY hotel). I would rank Gallager's as my close second. But all of these are a better choice than The Steak House at Circus Circus. And to be honest I find even Stuart Anderson's/The Cattle Company to have better steak than this place. When presented with my entree it looked good. But after my first bite of my steak I was greatly disappointed. It lack any seasoning. No salt, pepper. Nothin'. It also had charred grill marks that made the steak taste burnt. Even after attempting to make the steak more palatable by cutting off the char and adding some salt and pepper I still couldn't get myself to eat more than half of it. And I'm a girl that LOVES meat. I can eat a whole cowboy ribeye at Ruth Chris myself.  I will stab your hand with my fork if you try to take it from me when I didn't offer you any. And I will eat all of my yummy ribeye like the merry piggy I am when I am eating steak. But with this steak, I couldn't. The more I tried to make myself eat it because it was quite a costly ribeye ($54), the more I didn't want it. The char flavor had permeated the meat and cutting off the top and bottom didn't take away that burnt taste. It was sad that I had to waste it because I absolutely could not get myself to eat it.   I highly doubt I will try this place again.",

It has the feel of a 40's steak house and the smell is phenominal. Our steaks were Perfection and the Lamb Chops were HUGE - so were the Shrimp. If you have one \"expensive\" meal eat here. about 60/meal [not including appetizer or alcohol] but the steak comes with sides and a large salad. There is plently of Mood lighting and it does seem a little dark but everything is fantastic once your eyes adjust! Fine dining without a fine dinning dress code. Awesome!  Visited June 2016",

Followed by our porter house steak with a baked potato with all the fixings and followed by a giant piece of delicious cheesecake! Felix made our first experience here a very memorable one!

Waiters are True professionals and run the business efficiently. Now the bad part.  The food.  The bread basket was inedible except for the bread sticks. Ceaser Salad came out of the fridge cold and pre-made.  The parmesan seemed like it came from Costco, and there were no anchovies on the salad.  It really shouldn't be that difficult for a great steak house to make a decent Caesar. Next the New York Strip came out.  It was literally shoe leather.  It was also not only under seasoned, it was unseasoned. The waiter like at any great steak house took it back and replaced it with an extra petit filet.  The cut was great, but again unseasoned.  Finally, the side of mushrooms had a canned quality too them. The waiter did not charge me for my steak, but I didn't want a free steak, I wanted a great steak. I really wanted to like this place and return to Old Vegas.  Too bad!",

Atmosphere was perfect for having a nice dinner and conversation.   Food/Drinks: I started with a Bloody Mary. It was my least favorite part. It just didn't taste any different than someone pouring tomato juice and a splash of vodka in a glass. I was expecting something a little more. I ordered the filet mignon for dinner. It was absolutely delicious.   Staff: Our waiter was very charming and professional.   I'm giving this place only 4 stars because of the location. It was difficult to find inside of Circus Circus and my Bloody Mary was less than stellar. Aside from that, I'd go here again.",

We went early and were greeted by Ron, the manager of 31 years! He sat us in a semi private area and we got our same waiter David who was still there! David took excellent care of us. We got the food festival special which was an 8 oz filet topped with crab meat and a Bearnaise sauce, a salad, choice of potato, asparagus, and a dessert. The meal was exceptional as always and we were so pleased. We told several Uber drivers about The Steak House and one of them took his family Saturday night. He sent us a text that he loved it and would recommend it to others! We already planned another visit this year and will return again to this wonderful restaurant.",

    "text": "I was in town this past weekend with my son and four of his groomsman for his bachelor party.  We needed a steak and found this place here on Yelp.  After the mostly very positive reviews, we decided to go.    Circus Circus.  What can I say.  Wayyyy past its prime.  But nicely hidden, so much so that if you're not really looking you will miss it, is The Steakhouse.  What a nice surprise.    This is a throwback to the old school style steakhouse which my son and I totally love.  Dark wood, cozy surroundings etc.  I was looking for the Rat Pack. (Frank, Dino, Sammy)  You walk right past the grill area when you are seated and we had a table where we could watch the guys cooking the steaks.  Kind of neat.   Just a great atmosphere for eating a steak dinner with friends.  We were greeted by our waiter, Ray, promptly.  I mentioned the bachelor party thing and he immediately lit up and was engaged in making our time a good one.  He is a veteran of the game and knew just how to take care of us.  Drinks and food were ordered and away we went.  Where they stumbled was with the food.  Drinks were great, salads were very good.  But 3 of us had ordered steak medium rare and received medium well.  Also, I ordered a lobster tail with my ribeye and the tail was raw on the inside.  BUT our man Ray handled the situation professionally which is to say with no comment other than a sincere apology and the offer to redo the meals which we accepted.  Unfortunately, a few minute later, a runner came out with my lobster tail which had clearly been nuked in the microwave.  All shriveled up and steaming.  Ray was nearby and I flagged him down and he was aghast.  The ruined tail was taken away no questions asked.  We a were offered a round of free cocktails while we waited and it was a bachelor party so....Way to go Ray.  Unfortunately our 3 friends were done with their meals when our redone meals arrived.  But they arrived completely fresh and perfectly done.   No recycled veggies etc.  In the end we all had terrific meals and were completely satisfied.  But again, the fantastic Ray then offers unsolicited our choice of free dessert or an after dinner drink of our choice.  Again, being it was a bachelor party....We all had generous shots of a nice high end bourbon for \"dessert.\"  So even though there were a few hiccups, the staff handled them very well and we were completely satisfied.  And at a price that was about half of what we would have paid at one of the more notable places like Gordon Ramsey's at the Paris. A great time was had by all.  Thanks Ray.",

We went there as a group of 10 and the meal came out in excellent fashion. We started with cocktails in the bar. At first I felt the bartender was an old curmudgeon but after a half hour or so I realized he probably has seen it all in the last 40 years and nothing phased him. Plenty of hugged booze to choose from. You have to go by the locker where the beef is aged. You will see the process as well as an 18lb lobster they keep around just for conversation starters. I had the petite filet, cooked majestically. The bone in ribeye was their signature steak and offered in large quantities. Btw, the 'petite' filet was 8 ozs while their standard filet is 12 ozs!! They finish your meal with a variety of dessert choices, my favorite is their cheesecake which is flown in from Juniors in NYC. It's at Circus Circus and so worth your trip.",

But if you've ever eaten at any of the great steak restaurants around the country like Peter Lugar's or Mastro's or Joe's or Cut or Prime, then The Steakhouse at Circus Circus is barely okay, and perfectly situated for what it is: an ordinary, verging-on-gaudy place to eat beef.  But you know what? There's some perverse continuity here....because the rave reviews will continue...and it'll continue to remain a mystery as to why.  In the end, I guess what you know today, is based on what you knew yesterday.",

We celebrated Father's Day there and everybody thought it was a great choice.  The restaurant was celebrating their 30th anniversary so we each had a petitie filet mignon dinner for 30 bucks.  What a deal!  The french onion soup was the best I have ever had and I have sampled many a french onion soup from around the world.  The black bean soup was delicious and they give you a shot of sherry to go with it.  The salad was a throw away and I think they knew it.  So, they didn't charge us for it.  Yay.  The filet was predictably out of this world, perfectly cooked and aged.  The asparagus was okay but not excellent because it was not crisp enough.  The service was superb.  It is what you'd expect from a 5 star steak house.  We had a rambunctious 2 year old with us and they didn't bat an eye.  It was Circus Circus so there were many kids there.  Parents, think. you can bring your crazy little kid to a proper formal restaurant!  We had chocolate covered strawberries and they didn't charge us for that either.  Yum.",

I cancelled the meal as I lost my appetite from waiting. A few servers were appalled at the lack of concern from there manager. The fact that their own staff cares more than the managers is just baffling  I will never go here again. If I'm going to pay 60 dollars for a lobster I'd rather go somewhere that cares about their customers. My boyfriends steak was also over cooked. I've honestly this was chain restaurant quality.",

The steaks are of the highest quality and prepared to showcase the flavor of the meat (not highly seasoned like some steak places although sauces are available if you prefer that).  Only complaint is that there were no appetizers that didn't include shellfish so we couldn't order but I'm not taking away from the restaurant for her allergy as they had some wonderful salads and soup.

Or, at least, it's supposed to be good.  The menu is short, the ambiance reminds me of The Golden Steer on Sahara and the Strip:  old-school, dimly lit, very retro and stodgy/classy.  The food is really very average, but with well above-average prices.  The biggest issues I had with my food were, A) dry steak with little flavor, and B) the sides and appetizers were incredibly average.  Normal salad, normal baked potato, normal to below-average seafood.  It's decidely average, or 3 stars, but with the prices the way they are, it becomes a 2.  It's just fiercely skippable.  Lastly, the wine selection is truly poor.  1 of 5 stars.",

But once you cross the threshold you're transported to a totally different place to have a very enjoyable meal.  First off, I don't think the meat is \"US Prime\", so I took off a star. But it was awesome anyway. I'll credit their aging and cooking process. My meat was cooked precisely to my specification. I ate the whole rib eye and forgot to leave room for dessert.  The prices were very reasonable, considering that they included a salad or soup. I paid a little extra for the Caesar and wasn't disappointed. We never wanted for anything at our table at any time.

Wow, this place was more than OK, it turned out to be fantastic!   This is definitely your traditional old school steak house, warmly decorated in dark greens and mahogany.   We were seated right above where the chef cooks the meet over a mesquite charcoal grill, it's nice because you can watch them prepare your meal.   Dinner starts out with an assortment of breads, followed by a mixed house salad.    I had the \"Petite Prime Rib\" which actually should be called the HUGE Prime Rib.  It was perfectly medium rare, juicy and delicious and came with a side of mashed potatoes that I practically licked off of the plate.   My husband's Filet Mignon was melt in your mouth good.   Dinner for two was $115 before tip.which is affordable when compared to the other upscale steakhouses on the strip (especially considering that you don't have to order your salad and potatoes a la carte).  The service was great, definitely not pretentious at all.   The servers look like they have been at this for a long time, and were genuinely very nice to us.",

It's also completely empty since everyone at Circus Circus can't do math, likely can't order off of a menu in English, and can't win at the games.

Some reviewers say the decor is elegant, but it looks like the inside of an Irish bar to me.  I believe that because of its location in Circus Circus there is an illusion of classiness created by juxtaposition.  On the night that a friend and I went almost every item we ordered was awful.  They were out of sauteed mushrooms, so we opted for crab legs and grilled shrimp.  The shrimp were ok, but the crab legs were horrible.  Too briny and salty, we couldn't even finish them, and the friend I was with is a fat bastard.  The waiter ended up not charging us for those because he could tell our meal wasn't starting out well.  Next we got our side salads, which were fine, but they weren't anything special.  Besides, we were there for steak.  My friend got the porterhouse and I got a ribeye.  Mine was edible, whereas I had one bite of my friend's and could not have imagined eating much more than the single bite.  Having learned our lesson, we didn't opt for dessert.  I do recall getting decent service, but it doesn't matter when the meal is utterly unenjoyable.  The bottom line: this is probably a great steakhouse much of the time, but when we were there it sucked ass big-time, and you shouldn't risk that, let alone have to pay for it.",

    "text": "It's become tradition for me to take my assistant out to dinner on the last day of the POOL tradeshow in Las Vegas. Well, I feed and house him the entire time, but dammit, the last day is the day for a GOOD STEAK DINNER. In February we had gone to Morton's, and while it was good, the service and martini were better than the steak.   He had mentioned in February that Circus Circus is alleged to have the best steakhouse in Vegas, which I dismissed at least 5 separate times as total hooey. How could that be? We didn't make it during that trip. So this time, being in the mood for something a little more mellow and perhaps a bit silly, I suggested Circus Circus for our end-of-show dinner. i didn't change out of my grungy breaking-down-the-booth-packing-the-fixtures clothing at all, and off we went.   The Steak House is a class act. My helper friend took a look at the dark wood entrance and stepped to the side to tuck in his shirt and spit-shine his hair. We didn't have reservations as recommended, but they were able to seat us right away.   As soon as you walk in you're face to face with their curing room, an awe-inspiring enclosure with entire sides of meat just dry-aging away. Gorrrgeous! The decor in general is pretty great- dark, lots of wood and taxidermy, and just what you might expect of a steakhouse in a murder mystery.   Service was attentive and not smothering, but a little on the clueless side. He didn't know where the oysters came from, and since my friend the microbiologist recommended that I never eat oysters from the Gulf (apparently they're more likely to carry a particular strain of flesh-eating bacteria than our good old West Coast oysters) we passed. Also, when I asked him to please explain the differences between the cuts (I know what a Porterhouse and filet mignon are, but the difference between a New York strip and a regular ole strip?) he instead launched into a spiel that went like this:  \"Well, for the ladies [he looked pointedly at me] I recommend the filet mignon. It's a tender cut that's low in fat. We also have a petit filet if you don't want too much. And for the gentlemen [eyes over to my companion] we recommend the New York strip. It's a flavorful cut that's very popular with the gentlemen.\"  Thanks, sir. Thank you for being SO TOTALLY WRONG about how to explain cuts of steak. Annnnnyway, the New York strip sounded great to me so that's what I ordered. And apparently the filet mignon sounded great to my companion, so that's what he ordered. Well, at first he ordered the petit filet, but I reminded him that he has a wooden leg and would not be satisfied with the lighter lady's meal.   My steak was EXCELLENT. Rare, flavorful, perfect. The martini was pretty stellar as well. My companion's steak was initially a disappointment to him because it wasn't as flavorful as mine (and this is at the heart of why I only like filet mignon at home when you get to marinate it to your exact specifications. It's a tender bitch, but not as flavorful since it doesn't have the same fat content. FAT IS FLAVOR.) but he grew to kind of love it. And, I have to say, it was miles ahead of the Morton's filet mignon because it was delicously dry-aged. Companion thought it was a little gamey, but I thought it was kind of excellent.   All the other little details about the dinner were excellent as well, right down to their bread and butter. How great is that?   After dinner we went to the big top and watched 15 minutes of harrowing aerial acrobatics. Helps with digestion.",

    "text": "First of all, let's clarify the rumors.... Not all the MEAT is aged 21 days, only the Prime Rib is aged in the glass aging room.  The rest is pre-aged and pre-packaged, if you are close enough to the grill, you can watch them cut it open.  The meat is USDA Choice, not Prime cuts.  Those who know, will know the difference.  I ordered the bone in Ribeye medium rare, which was a bit more rare, bloody than normal. The texture was a bit tough and tasteless, just a chunk o meat.  They could at least sprinkle some salt or seasoning on it.  For $44, it was disappointing...I've had $6.99 steak specials that were just as good (bad)?  same?   The black bean soup?  Pass... I'v made better bean soup myself.  The server saw that I barely touched it and asked how it was and if I wanted something else instead, like a salad.  So I tried the Ceasar salad which was good.    The garlic mashed potatoes were gritty, like cream o wheat, weird taste to it.  The creamy horseradish was different, but good.  It had chives n paprika? sprinkled on top....  Also rumored was some kind of special coffee service, NOPE.... just cream n sugar....  Service was good, as to be expected, so they came through there.....  Either the local review journal got greased for the reviews, or the locals just don't know steak... ha ha get it?",

    "text": "Seems like a deal but read on please.  Well I have eaten here a few times now and I have to say I don't really like it.  First off its 47 bucks for a bone in rib eye now and even though it comes with sides they are lousy.  In one word to describe the whole meal, bland.  First off the steak is dry aged but only 21 days and they have really no aged flavor.  Second they do not season the meat at all, I mean not a bit, it was completely bland and flavorless, you can add salt at the table but by then it's too late.  My last steak I got was cooked ok, actually a little rare, but it had a strong burnt charcoal taste, a few others at the table said the same and some did not.       The few asparagus spears that comes with are very plain too and were very bland.  You can't pick your veggie, it's just whatever they give you.  Also the dinner salad is fine I guess but if you want caesar it's 5 bucks more.  There are only 2 potatoes to choose from baked or mashed, boring.  In the end this place isn't much cheaper and even more expensive than some, treat yourself and go somewhere else and share one or two real good sides with a group.  As long as you don't go overboard It will only cost a few bucks more a person and it is worth it.  A better steak I found that wasn't terribly pricey was the range at harrahs, way better.  As long as you don't compare this place to the expensive premium steakhouses like CUT or Carnevino this place isn't really a deal at all.  4 steaks at 44 (reasonable price for joe's, fleming's, range, envy, delfrisco...) and you all split 3 sides that you get to pick (more than enough) at 8 each would be 50 a person, only 3 dollars more a person than 47 rib eyes at circus circus.  I can't think of a legit steakhouse that I had a worse meal at so I don't see how you could go wrong elsewhere if you are considering this place.",

If you want incredible ambiance & don't mind paying double what you'd pay @ Circus Circus, go to SW Steakhouse @ Wynn. BUT; if you want a reliably FANTASTIC steak with delicious  sides... Go to Circus Circus!!! It's without question, the locals best kept secret. The prices are reasonable, quality excels all the great steakhouses in Vegas AND.... every steak COMES WITH decent bread, black bean soup (to die for) or a COLD crisp salad AND seasonal veggies (usually asparagus) AND a potato.  French onion is the best I've ever had. One warning; the walk to the restaurant is always entertaining. Watch your feet, I've almost stepped on crawling babies in the hall.

The Steakhouse cannot be more perfect.",

Not the type of place you would expect to have a top-notch steak dinner. Well, I was wrong. My group of 4 would agree as well. Steak was perfectly prepared. The price was incredibly reasonable as well. A petite filet is 8 ounces. Most petite filets are 4-5 ounces. The price for the petite filet, vegetables, potatoes, and soup or salad was $50. So glad we took the recommendation from our driver and gave this place a chance. Would highly recommend it.",

We were skeptical at first since it's in Circus Circus and the atmosphere there we try to avoid.  But this place is a slice of heaven!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with an amazing aroma of food.  The meat locker in the front behind the hostess desk has a beautiful array of cuts of meat, and if you look close enough the slabs have dates on them showing how fresh they are.  We were ushered by a very nice man from NY past the grilling island were you could see them preparing your food and we were promptly seated. The atmosphere is pretty upper class with rich woods, a fireplace, darkened room and pretty quiet aside from the restraunt music and the chattering of other diners. This is definitely NOT a place for small children. Our waiter (who kind of liked like Drew Carey) was attentive but not too the point of being annoying. When I described what kind of wine I wanted he suggested one that was spot on perfect.  Our water glasses were never empty and our meals were beyond good.  I had the petite filet mignon and it was the best I have ever tasted. The cheesecake which was recommended by both the NY gentleman and our waiter was also phenomenal.  The place is a bit pricy but absolutely worth it!",

Went here for dinner tonight with my boyfriend because he's been wanting to come back here after eating \"the best steak in Vegas\" several years ago. Its still on point!  Loved the warm breads that were served immediately after seating and taking drink orders. Steaks come with chef's vegetable which was asparagus, soup or salad, and mashed garlic or baked potato. I got the special of the evening which was the 8oz filet for $30 and accompaniments of grilled garlic shrimp and sauteed mushrooms.  My boyfriend got the bone in ribeye with added lobster tail.  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly! I also liked how the garlic butter for my grilled shrimp had bits of roasted garlic in clarified butter and was kept warm by a candle underneath. My shrimp were huge! More like prawns than shrimp...the lobster tail was also a very nice size.  After the main course we were too full to order dessert, but the dessert cart looked very tempting. The only con I would have to add is that I wish they had more appetizer selections and more vegetable sides a la carte besides the chef vegetable.  This was a well worth $200 dollar meal....and much more satisfying than Cut!!",

Definitely not Michelin worthy.   The Black Bean Soup was surprisingly good but it was too big of a portion. There was a dessert cart which was cool though it reminded me of Claim Jumpers.

    "text": "Birthday Vegas Trip: 4/3 - 4/9, 2013 The one thing my fiance was dying to do on this trip was take me to The Steakhouse in Circus Circus for my birthday dinner.  He raved and raved, saying it was one of his top 3 restaurants ever - that is a loaded statement coming from a foodie like him!  We took a cab down from our hotel on the Strip down to Circus Circus.  Let's just say I was apprehensive when we entered the rambunctious casino that was flooded with people - adults and kids alike.  I felt like I was truly at a circus, and I will admit I was seriously doubting any restaurant that would chose this place for its location.  Once we finally found The Steakhouse, when we entered, it was like we were transported to another world. I kid you not.  No noise, no craziness.  Just Frank Sinatra out of the speakers and fabulous light in the classically styled dining room.  We had a reservation (which we were a tad late for after wandering around the casino - but it was not an issue) and immediately were whisked past the beautiful dry-aging steaks and seated in a huge, cozy booth.  Perfect atmosphere! And, just like that, I was at ease and ready to celebrate my 32nd birthday with a feast!  Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive, but not overbearing.  We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir and chose the King Crab Legs on Ice to share.  Huge portions of crab and ample cocktail and tartar sauces.  The perfect starter; just enough not to fill you up.  Having already decided that we'd share a Porterhouse, we ordered it medium.  The portions are huge and there was no way we'd finish two entrees. One might consider this, especially since you are likely on vacation and a hotel room may not be the best place to enjoy steak leftovers!  I have heard, though, that if you ask them to slice it up before they box it, they absolutely will.  We each got our choice of sides - I chose a salad and a baked potato and my fiance had their garlic mashed.  Everything was great.  Again, they served very big portions and you could tell they'd used quality ingredients.  It goes without saying that the steak was cooked to perfection.  We skipped dessert - a rarity - but nothing was beckoning on this particular night.   Worth the price! Quite the experience! A hidden gem in Circus Circus!",

Many times I have had sub-par food but everyone has an off night and service, location etc have led me to return for a better night. Having always wanted to try this steakhouse but unable to convince myself that a client dinner or romantic evening would be perfect inside Circus Circus, finally last night I had my chance. Fright Dome tickets with a steak prior.  Here's the deal:  1) Great Service 2) Incredible black bean soup 3) Nice salad 4) Great shrimp app 5) NY steak very juicy  So how do I find fault?  Cooking area that is out in the open is decades old and you see all the sides, mushroom, asparagus, sauces in pots that may be clean but just plain old looking. Electrical cords every where, the round ones like my parents used to have! Anyone who says this is best steak ever, needs to get around a little, sorry but that is the truth. Overall not a bad experience but if they are looking for my $200+ dinner for 2 they need to do a lot more. After all when it comes down to it do you really want to go through a cheap, old, smokey, Circus Circus for a romantic meal or business dinner...I don't think so!  You might see me for next years Halloween and Fright Dome but other than that your on your own.  But, that's just my opinion!",

I wanted to be able to start a sentence with \"At least The Steakhouse in Circus Circus was good...\"  The sides and garlic mashed potatoes were excellent and the inside was beautifully appointed in classic dark wood and leather upholstery. The waiter was friendly and very professional. The wine was a nice vintage. But the point of a steakhouse is to know what the hell you are doing with the meat.  The prime rib I ordered was a hot mess. I ordered medium-well and got rare. It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat. I performed major surgery to liberate what turned out to be about 4oz of actual meat from the center of this disgusting hunk of beef fat and cartilage. By the time I'd finished sawing away the lard, I was thoroughly grossed out but the huge pile of fat dominating my plate and could barely eat my potatoes and what little meat I had.  So when the bananas foster came for dessert and it had lumps of un-blended cooking paraffin settled at the bottom like marbles, I was ready to vomit. If you are going to make a thickened caramel sauce and use paraffin, get it to the right temperature to ensure it all blends together. Otherwise customers get a mouthful of what feels like cold grease lumps.  Just disappointing. But I guess that's what happens when you eat at a place that has a huge neon clown outside, cackling its way into your nightmares.",

Who knew such a great restaurant would be inside of Circus Circus? Come for happy hour between 4 and 6 at their small bar. The drinks are half price and they don't cut corners. Michael is a great bartender. He's friendly, professional and has good knowledge of the town. The mesquite grill is in the middle of the restaurant, so you can see them grilling your steak. I started with the shrimp cocktail. Giant shrimp that were fresh and great tasting. For my meal, I had the porterhouse steak with salad, garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. One of the many great things about this place is that your great steak comes with soup or salad, baked or mashed potatoes and veggies. At most other high end steak houses, the steak is a la carte and doesn't come with anything. Other places make you pay like $15 for each side. Anyway, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and very tender. They season the meat enough so it has flavor, but you can taste the beef. No need for steak sauce, but I would imagine with just a touch, it can be great as well. The service was excellent and I have nothing bad to say about this place. It's a nice little oasis inside of a cheesy casino. I will be back and I will recommend this restaurant for sure!",

    "text": "I deducted one star because the breads in the bread basket were old and cold. I don't mean not hot, I mean COLD as in just came out of the fridge/defrosted from the freezer. Such a bummer, because that is the first impression of a steakhouse. The bread sticks were good though. Mark up on wine was quite high, but our server Chae was wonderful.  I deducted another star because I was shocked to learn that a restaurant located in Circus Circus does not have non glass cups, or at least a lid to put on the glass cup for kids. The lack of a kids' menu (while strange for a restaurant located feet away from juggling clowns) we were okay with--I get it, you don't want this turning into a Rainforest Cafe.  But come on folks, this is just a plain safety and liability issue. A kid could hurt himself if the glass shatters (which will happen if it's dropped). Not to mention, the pain of dealing with a dumped drink over the kids clothes (glad did not happen to us) especially since you'll no doubt get a bunch of diners who are tourists and are limited to what they can pack in a diaper bag for a dinner. You have to expect kids will dine there because your are located in CIRCUS CIRCUS. Know your audience and provide parents with a more pleasant experience. I would not even take my kids to the steakhouses at fancy hotels.  We split a chicken entree for our kids. Thankfully, we were not charged the $17 split fee (I would have lost my mind if they had done that for a 2 and 5 year old).   Look, this restaurant is free to have any rule it wants. What made this hard to swallow is the fact that they don't seem to enforce other rules. Their sign clearly says \"no tank tops\". Yet, a man at the table next to us was wearing a tank top.   So someone dining at your steakhouse in a wife beater in violation of your rules is okay, but a kids' cup is beneath you?????!!!!!   Interesting that another Yelper made a comment about people dining there in tank tops, and in violation of the restaurant's rules.  Normally I would deduct another star because the beef is not prime, but they charge prime prices. Here, they dry age non-prime beef. However, I did not deduct the other star because the food was good, and our server was great.",

Salad had so many different vegetables in it and was very good.  The shrimp is the biggest I have ever seen!  The Alaskan king crab legs were very large and the lobster was great too.  You have to come for the seafood if nothing else.  If you are going to order dessert try the cheesecake, one of the best I have ever had. Stay away from the creme brulee unless you like it lumpy and burnt tasting.  The steak wasn't horrible but it didn't do much for me, no flavor really. They need to season it differently or maybe start seasoning them if they don't at all.   They give huge portion sizes so make sure you are hungry when you arrive. I would give it a five except for the lack of flavor of the steak and yucky creme brulee.  The restaurant is expensive but well worth it. I will be back again.",

We came at a perfect time, we had no reservation and were lucky to be seated right away. I would highly recommend a reservation though, because as we were leaving there was a large crowd at the host stand.  Service was great, and everything was served immediately. Our drinks from the bar came out right away, fresh basket of bread, and our salads too. Our steaks barely took a little bit longer. I enjoyed my bleu cheese salad very much, and my steak was very good too. My only complaint is that I ordered my steak medium, and it was more medium rare. Still very good though. My husbands only complaint was his steak had no flavor and he had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper. Other than that, I think we both enjoyed everything.  All together our meal was over $100, but I don't feel the pricing was off considering the nice environment, speedy service, and quality of food.",

I about croaked when he suggested a restaurant in Circus Circus. It was my hubby's bday, his choice, shut my mouth and go. I WAS SHOCKED! The atmosphere is soft lighting, dark woods, green glass covered chandeliers. Romantic and comfortable. We sat overlooking the enclosed chef grilling area which was entertaining and amazing to see the enormous cuts of steaks being grilled. We started with appetizers of shrimp cocktails which were prawn sized and very fresh. I had lamb chops and my husband had the porterhouse. Both were FANTASTIC. Both had a nice outside searing with kosher salt. The garlic mashed potatoes were the real deal and the grilled asparagus was perfectly grilled. The waiter must have overheard my hubby comment on what a great birthday dinner and the waiter returned with a slice of cake drizzled in chocolate. Even though my hubby was full, he managed to find space to eat it!! We would DEFINITELY go back. Don't let the hotel's crazy, busy atmosphere deter you from going.",

For some reason we never made it to The Steak House until recently.  I was not expecting the experience we had.  I rarely give a five star, but this deserved it.  The steak was incredible.  I had the large cut prime rib and it melted in my mouth.  Perfectly cooked.  I had a pretty good appetite but still took half of it home.  The service, the way things were presented, the timing, the way the staff took extra care to provide my wife with a nice vegetarian meal, it was all flawless.  I know it's the Circus Circus, but this is one high class steak house.",

However I can't in good conscience let this steakhouse be rated 4 stars.   We came here with a party of 5 and all of us ordered different cuts of steak and had different temperature requests.  4 out of the 5 steaks we got were not even edible.  I was able to take 3 bites of my prime rib before I couldn't stomach another bite.  The steak was flavorless and felt like I was chewing on rubber.  The other people in my party were also not able to finish their steaks as they were over cooked and chewy.   Much to my amazement the server did not offer to take these steaks off when he came to the table and nobody had touched their food.  I really wanted to like this place because it has a good ambience but the food should not be served to paying patrons.  And with the bill coming in at $200 for two steaks and no booze I honestly felt like I had played a rigged slot machine.  It might be time to let this old Vegas relic finally die off.",

The salad was a very ample size and quite tasty. My porterhouse was very large, tasty and served a perfect medium rare. The asparagus and the garlic mashed potatoes were also excellent. My wife had lamb chops and she couldn't stop raving about them. Truly a 5 star meal. We had both of those incredible dinners, and a bottle of delicious Cabernet, for under $150.00.

My plate came with asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes and a creamy sauce that was so good.  Our kids really enjoyed it as well. Its the best we have ever had and we eat out a lot.

Unfortunately this steak house can't properly cook a medium rare rib eye...my first steak had good flavor but was cooked medium and too chewy for my liking. So they nicely cooked me a new steak however the 2nd steak was raw in the middle and there was no way I was going to eat it. They were going to recook this steak but everyone knows you never recook a steak especially after cutting through it. So they gave me a third steak which took forever to arrive. By this time my friends have finished their meals and I was now no longer hungry and I was still charged for my steak. I was so bummed I didn't even bother anymore and just wanted to pay the bill and leave.  It's very disappointing to go to a steak house that can't cook a medium rare steak.

The sauce that came with the steak (shouldn't have to dip a good steak in anything) was also not enjoyable. We all took a couple of bites and left the uneaten steaks at the table.

Never thought I'd say this, but I'll take dinner date night here over some of the overrated pretentious hip celebrity chef joints we've been to. Mr. B suggested Carnevino but I wanted to go somewhere different this time around and my BFF and I have never been here yet, so we planned double date night here with our husbands.   Reservations: Highly suggest you make reservations ahead of time.http://www.opentable.com/the-steakhouse-at-circus-circus-reservations-las-vegas?restref=68473&rid=68473 This place is only open during dinner hours and limited seating.  Dress Attire: Business Casual is just fine.  Location: Inside Circus Circus Casino. Getting here is something else. After you get past having to go through the parking garage from hell and avoid getting rundown by rugrats heading to Adventuredome, you'll step through the doors of \"The Steak House\" and breathe a sigh of relief.  Your hostess will take you past the area where they dry age the steaks. Here's it's 21 days we were told.  You'll go past the exhibition area also where they grill the steaks. Smells so good!   Menu is simple.http://circuscircus.com/images/PDF/SteakhouseMenu.pdf  We all ordered different cuts of steak and our dinners included fresh baked bread, Chef choice of vegetable (asparagus) black bean soup or salad, garlic mash,baked potato or rice. Pretty great deal if you ask me. We planned it that way. My BFF and I told our husbands, they could buy us new shoes.  Anyway my rib eye was a large, thick cut, seasoned well and juicy.   Dining area has half circular booths lined along the wall, tables in the middle.dimly lit, The place oozes of classy 1980's Vegas.  According the the hostess this place has been here since 1982. She said a lot of the staff has been there that long too.  Very enjoyable dinner. We ordered desserts though and had coffee and drinks afterwards. We probably stuck around longer than we should. Bff & I are notorious for it. We were never rushed  and our servers kept checking up on us even after we were finished with dinner.   Service was exemplary.  We all agreed we would come back again!",

I was curious to see that a nice steak house existed at Circus Circus so of course I wanted to check it out! It's located in a row of vendors selling jewelry, purses and Hello Kitty items. Once you go inside you are transported to a place with nice dark wood and stuffed birds...old school decor.   The first thing you see when you walk in is a big slab of beef legs hanging near the hostess podium. There was even a huge lobster in there. I didn't know if that was real or not but I wouldn't mind seeing it slathered in butter, garlic and lemon juice!   I started off with the French Onion soup which had a nice gooey cheese. The broth was also tasty. I had the petite fillet for $41.00 which comes with your choice of potato and vegetable. I chose the baked potato and carrots. I tasted my husband's garlic mashed potatoes and wished I ordered that instead because they were amazing! The meat here is the star because it just melts in your mouth. The sides lack excitement but they taste good.   Here's a tip: If you gamble at any of the MGM hotels you can use your comps to pay for the meal. I guess Circus Circus is like a stepchild to the MGM affiliated casinos. My aunt was able to comp her meal and my cousin's meal .",

That's why we have husbands, to finish the rest for us. The steak was so tender and juicy. The lobster was so good, as it was served with fresh melted butter. This steakhouse is a little bit on the pricey side considering it is in Circus Circus away from the main strip. However, I did appreciate the aged steak. I remember as a kid when I first went here, I fell in love. It was only befitting that I come here the night of my wedding to fall in love again.  The interior is very dark, with an old Vegas mob feel. They even have a window where you can see the beef being aged right before your eyes. It's on of those places you have to try. It smells so delicious the moment you walk inside. Reservations are a must, because I don't believe they take walk-ins.",

    "text": "We ended up at THE Steak House via a recommendation from a friend who had lived and worked in Las Vegas. She commented that, among locals, this is where to find the best steak in town - and it has been voted best steakhouse for seven years straight. I wholeheartedly agree.  First of all, forget that you are at Circus Circus. Ignore the smoky, rundown feel of the casino and head straight for the restaurant. The ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a Vegas steakhouse: dark, intimate, and quiet. The servers are fast and seem to fade away into the background, creating an environment where you can just focus on your company and the food.  The wine list is on the small side but curated with a finesse for steakhouse fare. The soups, salads, and sides are also very complementary classics that you would want to find on a steakhouse menu.  I had the petite filet. I received a perfect medium rare, with the right amount of salt and pepper to bring out the best of the meat. The peppercorn sauce should be bottled and sold; the garlic mashed potatoes were better than anything I could make at home; and, the asparagus with brown butter was the definition of crisp-tender.  And the desserts...oh, the desserts. YUM! We had a party of five so we just ordered one of each dessert. Nothing says dessert at a steakhouse like decadent chocolate cake, cheesecake, tiramisu, and chocolate-covered strawberries. What a delight!  Don't go to THE Steak House expecting some giant, overblown menu like most of the places in Vegas; go with the expectation that you will get the best cut of meat and the best sides that Vegas has to offer. Everything is cooked with expertise and the service is outstanding. This is THE place for steak.",

    "text": "After reading the great reviews and hearing about it from others, I booked reservations here instead of the newer, trendier steak houses in Vegas for 7pm on a slow Monday night.  I was looking forward to one of the best steaks I've ever had, maybe I got my expectations up too high?    First off, upon walking in I read on the podium the dress code was \"smart casual\", Yelp says casual...I was definitely casual and worried we were under-dressed.  After glancing at the others around the restaurant, I definitely was dressed smarter-casual than many others.  Maybe it was smart casual in the 1980's?  Next, the wine list.  I like drinking Pinot Noir with my steak.  A quick glance showed around eight choices of red by the glass, I believe it was all California wines and not a single Pinot Noir.  I settled for a Cab Sav and she had a Merlot, they were both fine and both were the cheapest wine by the glass at $8.  I ordered the Rib-Eye medium rare and she had the NY Strip medium.  I had the mashed potatoes and salad and she had the wild rice and salad.  Both came with asparagus (though the menu didn't mention any vegetable).  The salads came and both were excellent.  Steaks came out 6-8 minutes after we finished salads which was great as I knew they would be hot off the grill.  Mine was cooked medium rare but seemed overly charred on the outside, but it may have been just the large fat trimmings.  Hers was more medium rare than mine but she didn't send it back.  The problem with both steaks was the dryness and total lack of flavor.  A good steak cooked to perfection you should be able to cut with a butter knife, these two $60 steaks, not a chance.  I was very disappointed.  I didn't want to insult the chef and ask for steak sauce, so we added a little salt and pepper, it didn't help.  Maybe it was an off night for us?    The side items were fine and service was excellent to be expected, water was recharged often.  Though sometimes the server filling the water glasses would get too carried away pulling the water bottle up and down as if doing a magic trick and water would bounce onto the salad or dinner plate...stop the gimmicks and just pour my water please?    Dessert was tiramisu which was outstanding.  The check was $155 with tip, $185.  I've had much better two steak dinners well under $100.  Sorry Circus Circus, I won't be back.",

For the reviews and fan fare, I was expecting so much more. I was going to rate this a 3, but we were in and out under an hour. If I'm paying $60 a steak, I'd like to relax a little in between dishes.   The service was so so. It was good, not sure if I loved it or hated it. That's all I can say about that. The old school flare was cool, but I have tons of restaurants like that back in Detroit.   Maybe other steaks are better than the filet, but I'd try somewhere else for the money. Salad was good, but was a $6 upgrade for a Caesar. The French onion soup was, just blah.   I was hoping for so much more.",

The waitstaff is attentive and courteous and it smells great.  the Kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and it makes for a unique dinning experience.  The only complaint I have is the food was mediocre.  Much better at Ruth Chris. I had the rib eye and it had no flavor.  why don't they sprinkle a little salt before grilling to let it seep into the meat, it's not the same to add salt after cooking.  It wasn't just the lack of salt, it did not have the smokey, grilled flavor that makes a good piece of meat great.  So, I'll pass next time and go to where I know the food is good.",

    "text": "This was our second time here and with this night's experience, I figured it warranted a review.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we had a drink at the bar first. Nice area with a dark, romantic ambiance.  The bartender was friendly and drinks were stiff, which I don't mind one bit.    We checked back in with the hostess about 5 minutes early and were seated right away.  As with the bar, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy and dark.  Perfect for a nice intimate dinner.  We were quickly greeted by our server and busser with the usual amenities of bread, water, and menus.  Our drinks and appetizer orders were taken quickly.   Prior to dinner we had Jumbo shrimp on ice, French onion soup, and Waldorf wedge salad.  All 3 were delicious.  Fresh, tasty... but the soup was superb.  For dinner my girlfriend had ribeye on bone and I was trying the Wagyu fillet.  One thing we noticed is that neither steak was very heavily seasoned.  By that I mean, not overly salty or peppery.  I imagine to keep the meat more naturally flavored relying on each patron to salt to taste.  I was fine with this as I could season it to my taste.  The flavor of the ribeye was amazing.  Perfectly charred and cooked to temperature.  The wagyu filet was ridiculously good.  The flavor was so unique, and the texture was so tender.  Like not even eating meat.  As steaks go, I usually favor a ribeye.  They tend to be a little fattier but so much juicier.  This wagyu fillet was very very delicious.  Although with most, filets they tend to be less fatty and a little less juicy.  I would say the same goes for this cut, however with the price point being slightly higher than the ribeye, the flavor and experience was very worth it.  For desert we had the cheesecake (from Junior's) and the chocolate covered strawberries.  Both very delicious as well.    Lastly, I need to mention the service.  Coming from a food service background, my girlfriend noticed that our sever was seated with 3-4 new tables all within 15 minutes of us being sat.  One was large party.  This in no way deterred from the service we received.  Our server Chae was phenomenal.  At no point did we feel like we were waiting particularly long for any portion of our meal.  At the same time he could be seen moving quickly yet patiently to each table giving everyone equal attention.  His attitude was very impressive.  One hiccup we had was with the temperature of my steak.  I had ordered my filet medium rare.  Cutting into it, it was obviously cooked more to medium well. When Chae came by to check on our food he noticed the temperature almost the same time I was about to bring it up.  Without hesitation he apologized and brought me a new plate (all fresh items) cooked to perfection in less than 5 minutes.  Along with Chae, the busser/runner Javier was a delight to have.  He frequently checked on us to make sure we had everything we need.  Javier also had a very enthusiastic and enjoyable attitude which made us laugh throughout the evening.  The pair very much made our night.    All in all this was a great evening for us. Mistakes happen and can often change one's perspective of a restaurant, but with service that these two provided, and the great food we received, in the end it makes for a 5 star experience.  One we'll definitely be back for, and one I would recommend to all.",

Having been to just about every steakhouse in Las Vegas I had always wanted to try this place. I never could bring myself to walk through the garbage can that is the Circus Circus. I wanted to like it and have level expectations but, my taste buds don't lie.   For starters... The service was exceptional and our waiter was as good as it gets. The atmosphere was as expected. The booth we had was comfortable and well lit. The sides, bread and salads were good. The garlic shrimp were great and the crab cake was a crab cake. No complaints there.   With that being said... My wife and I both had different cuts and both of us felt the flavor was lacking. Which was surprising because they were both cooked correctly. My wife ordered a rare plus filet and it was just plain bland. I had the Rib-eye with what felt like absolutely no seasoning at all. I understand I might sound a little critical, but that was not worth what I just paid.  The only thing that matters at a steakhouse is the steak. Period End Dot",

Now on to the food, I love nearly every item I have tried here from the steaks, appetizers, and their soups. French Onion Soup: I get this every time and it's delicious almost every time. There was one time it was a tad salty but I still drank the whole bowl Steaks: I've had the T-Bone, Rib-Eye, NY Strip and the Prime Rib. All the portions are MASSIVE. I typically have left overs and they're like 2 meals! I liked all the steaks but the one time I had the prime rib it was on the drier side.  Overall good place for a date, delicious steaks with plentiful food but it is pretty dark inside so I typically ask for a table closer to the lights",

    "text": "\"Are we still inside the clown hotel?\" That's what a friend asked as we stepped through the dark wood door into a paneled hallway marked with vintage Las Vegas photos.  The dining room of THE Steak House at Circus Circus couldn't clash more with the hotel around in, and that's a very good thing. Gone are the pastel pinks and clown imagery, replaced instead with a large display of aged steaks and a prominent broiler and kitchen. The dining room is furnished with similar care, recalling old Vegas with comfortable leather booths and dim lighting.  It's easy to disregard this restaurant when you park in an aging garage and walk in through a tacky casino that's on the lowest end of the price scale in Las Vegas.  But THE Steak House sets itself apart, and not just with the quiet ambience and tasteful vintage decor.  The food here is top notch, far exceeding my expectations on two visits nearly five years apart.  On my most recent trip, my party enjoyed the New York Strip, Filet Mignon, Prime Rib, and Porterhouse. All four cuts were prepared deliciously, with quality matched by the sides and appetizers.  The only low point of the meal was the bar service. The cocktails started out strong and tasty, but our second and third rounds lacked the same punch. This won't keep me from returning, though, as it's the sole negative mark in an otherwise wonderful evening.  That evening came to a close with dessert. THE Steak House imports Junior's Cheesecake from New York City. If you've never had the pleasure, this is a must.  It was served with some strawberry topping and a dollop of whipped cream, though neither of these added much. The cheesecake on its own is really the star here.  All tolled, the meal was not cheap, but we enjoyed giant steaks and plentiful drinks. One important benefit of this steakhouse versus others is that the cost of a cut and two sides here matches that of just the steak at most other Las Vegas steakhouses.  With that in mind, it's definitely worth the dingy parking garage and the garish decor to get to this little Las Vegas gem.",

    "text": "Not what I expected and I mean that in a good way!  Had plans to have dinner with my family (me, my wife, 2 kids) at another hotel before attending a show I wanted to take my kids to but we were running EXTREMELY late.   We walked down the escalator from our room tower and towards the casino and as we were walking over to catch a cab I told my wife I didn't think we were gonna make it to our dinner reservation in time.   As we walked we came across a door - literally a wooden doorway - with the words 'THE Steakhouse' written above it right in the middle of the craziness that is Circus Circus. I looked at my wife and said 'this will have to do.'  We walked in and never expected a restaurant this nice to be located inside Circus Circus.  The waiter mentioned they aren't used to having kids eat here. That might explain why we were seated by ourselves in the corner of the restaurant. We didn't mind.  My only complaint is that, surprisingly, they don't have a kids menu. At a restaurant in Circus Circus? Really??? But the waiter was kind enough to talk to the chef and they were nice enough to whip up some chicken tenders and fries that weren't even on the menu for the kids. My wife and I were very appreciative of that since it was too late to go somewhere else and we were all starving and had a show to get to.  My rib-eye was excellent. The steaks here are comparable to any of the higher end steak houses on the strip and I've eaten at most of them. My wife had the petite filet and added the 3 giant prawns as an add-on. They were huge! Like the size of my toddlers fist. She only had 2 and offered me one but I couldn't even finish my steak.  Cuts of steak here start at around $50 and go up to $70 or $80 and come with soup or salad, vegetables, and mashed or baked potatoes.  I wish they had more side options though. They ONLY let you choose from either a house salad or black bean soup, and either baked or mashed potatoes. Nothing else. Would have been nice to have more variety.",

The carpet looks like it's still the original and the midway is still the same too. Walking into the steakhouse, it's got that old school restaurant feel. Very classic steakhouse vibe.   We started with some crab cakes. They were pretty good. They split the order for us and gave us each a plate. That made it easy and the cakes were delicious. Great crab to stuffing ratio. Big chunks of crab.  I was deciding between the filet and the ribeye and opted for ribeye for more marbling and flavor. For the price of the steak, you also get a few sides. You get to choose between a basic soup or salad and choice of starch like mashed potatoes, baked potato, or rice pilaf. I got the salad and baked potato to go with my medium rare ribeye.  The salad is pretty basic. Some iceburg lettuce with tomato, onion, crutons and beets. Very meh.  The steak came out and it was huge! For sure over 20oz bone in ribeye. Baked potato was also huge and it comes with some asparagus spears too. The steak was cooked to temp which is great. But I think the steak was a bit lacking in flavor. It needed some more salt. I added some peppercorn sauce and creamy horseradish, but the steak should be the star and I think it missed the mark.  The portions are big and comes with sides so in terms of Las Vegas steakhouses, it's a better deal than most. I think if you're looking for no frills type of steakhouse this will be good. If you want a more upscale dining experience you are probably better off at another place on the strip.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place after reading all the positive reviews. An old school Vegas steakhouse at affordable prices? Sign me up.  The Steak House had the appearance of being legit. Dimly lit. Wood paneling. A dry aging room front and center. A smoky aroma filling the whole place. The cocktails menu had all the classics and the drinks were good and strong.  I ordered the bone-in rib eye. The menu didn't say, but I believe it was 16oz. $67. So unlike most steak restaurants, this included sides. Typically this steak will run you $59-$75 at a good steakhouse. I \"upgraded\" one of my sides to French onion soup for $6. I also ordered some mushrooms. $10.  French onion soup was fair. Steak arrived. I ordered medium rare. It was at least medium. Potato was a potato. You had to dress it yourself which I don't mind, but no cheese?! Vegetable was asparagus. It had little to no taste. Mushrooms had a weird citrus acidity to them. Seriously, saute in butter, salt and pepper. Add red wine. Reduce. It's not hard.  The steak had okay char, but was definitely not dry aged for any reasonable length of time and was not a very good cut of meat. Tough with little marbling.   After sitting waiting for our waiter for what seemed like forever I spotted some of the problems. Chef had a mesquite broiler, but was not doing any indirect cooking. Just slapping steaks on the grill. This leads to overcooking, toughness, and mesquite smoke filling the restaurant.   Overall, I was disappointed. This place had all the makings of a good steakhouse, but it was only on the surface. I think the included sides are just a gimmick as well. I spent just as much money as I normally would, but had to choose from limited and lower quality sides. Won't be back.",

I wouldn't pay more than $30 for that disappointment.   The problem with tenderloin is they are very lean. Fat gives meat good flavor which typically filets lack. Steaks such as these need some form of marinade or sauce to enhance the flavor.   I can't speak for the other steaks but I can't imagine they would be much better if they aren't able to get a simple filet right.",

The bar is wonderful, healthy pours with an older gentlemen there that is personable and inviting. Problem however: you can't order from the menu at the bar. You can only order apps, which are all seafood. The FINEST steakhouses in Texas has - albiet limited- the ability to serve something once furry and don't make you look like a loser sitting in the main dining area by yourself, amongst dozens of couples and big-tops full of people laughing and pointing at you.  Now to the steaks: They have all the right stuff, the right cuts, the right cooking techniques, the right char-grill with real mesquite wood. But they miss something that I think sets Texas steakhouses apart from this place. Well, two something's actually. 1. Spice. 2. Thickness. If it's spicy, it has this thing.. oh, what's it called.. oh FLAVOR.. That's the word I'm looking for! And, if it's cut thicker, you can sear the outside for a nicer cool rare center. I wanted a rare steak, and was talked into the porterhouse due to how it would \"render\" in the bone and they said they would char it to perfection.   Bullshit.. the perfect steak isn't burnt. It's seared. The perfect steak has flavor. Not just a dry aged (although I agree a nice cut) tossed on a grill then splashed with water to put the flames out.   All was not lost however, it was a fair dining experience as the wait staff were so fast and courteous, and the drinks were poured right. The potatoes, asparagus, and side salad were magnificent and they don't make you wait for anything.  Will I go back, probably.. but this time I'm throwing a c-note to the waiter to go hand-select my steak, cut it to my specifications, and throw some cracked black pepper at least and maybe some salt on it and bring it out seared - not flame fried.   Oh, and the desert tray looked divine - but I chose a nice digestif for desert instead.",

I had my salad with blue cheese dressing.  Nice chunks of fresh blue cheese and good veggie toppings on the salad.  We both had the filet mignon.  Melted in your mouth.  In addition, it had such a nice flavor (think they put mesquite in the grill).  Service was great too.  Our glasses were always filled with water, we had minimal time where we were sitting without food and they cleared our plates immediately after we were done eating (my husband hates sitting at a table when finished plates are left on the table).  You have to try this place.  My husband was skeptical but wants to dine here again during our next trip to Vegas.  Don't let the Circus Circus theme deter you.",

And it felt like somewhere mobsters would dine! Lol anyways, we were seated & immediately served water from the bottle. Our server came and introduced himself & we just decided to have water since this is a fine dining steakhouse. (There was pretty much only wine to choose from) they also have us some bombass bread I have ever munched on! We then went & ordered our salad & what kind of dressing with it; I chose red wine vinaigrette  it was so delicious & fit right with the salad. The lettuce in the salad was the freshest I've ever ate. I decided for my main course to get the New York ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes & my bf decided to go for the T-bone steak with baked potatoe and I got mine \"medium-well\" and he got his the same :) OMG!! When it came it looked so beautiful!!  and everything about it was just on point! Even when I cut it with my steak knife! It was like cutting butter! Loved every bite of it! Even the mashed potatoes! And the busser was on time with filling my glass full with water :) for dessert we decided to go with dipped strawberries in chocolate & it was cute how they presented the dessert on the cart that goes around in the restaurant but those are just for display ! I would definitely go back!",

I went twice in the past couple of years and everyone I was with said \"amazing\" this time I heard it was \"ok\"  not much flavor not the melt in your mouth steak of a year ago . I'm giving 3 stars as the place inside is nice waiters are great but the steak is not the same as a year ago so hopefully someone responds to this by telling us they have decided to go back to their old cut of meat ! Please Do so I can brag about your steakhouse again ! Still a decent price for Vegas ! Cheesecake is True NY cheesecake very good !",

Wine menu very poor. So why the great review? Once you get inside, again tune out the other clientele (let's just say Walmart is on par).. The service staff was wonderful, ambiance pleasant old fashioned feel, the chefs amazing for what they do, you can't stop watching their work, featured in glassed area in middle of restaurant.. the steak (that's what you're there for) impeccably prepared. They do one thing extraordinary and focus on that. It was worth the godawful stroll through Circus Circus.",

Salad, Bread, Baked potato and Steak all included in the price.  Excellent value.  Will go back for sure! My mouth is watering right now :-)  Update 03/31/07.  Went back again on Saturday night.  Went early to check on our reservations and lo and behold, they didnt have us marked down.  A little frustrating but the manager(sorry I cant remember his name) said to come in at 7 and they would see what they could do.  Got there at 7 and were seated immediately.  Excellent service by our waiter Felix.  Amazing food and amazing service once again.  I just want to thank the manager of the place for doing a great job and for excellent service by Felix.  This is the type of service that will keep me coming back every single time I am in Vegas!  Thank you to the entire crew at The Steakhouse!",

The steaks are good, but the Prime Rib is always  G-R-E-A-T .  The place isn't \"cheap\", but when you consider the entrees include both salad and potato, it's a better deal than comparable other steakhouses.  A bit tricky to get in on weekends because they're usually fully booked unless you want to eat at either 5pm or after 10",

The quality of the steak was amazing, extremely tender and with an excellent flavor. The place is a great value too because unlike other steakhouses the entree comes with your choice of salad or soup, a veggie and your choice of startch (hubby had the rice blend and loved it and I had the baked potato also excellent). The service was top notch and the atmosphere retro, reminded me of some of the old school steakhouses in San Francisco.  I would definitely recommend this place for those brave enough to walk through Circus Circus to get there! (It is worth though it I promise you).",

Most high end steakhouses are a la carte. I always get the bone-in ribeye...delicious and perfectly cooked. The service is always amazing and attentive. The only downside is making the trek to the place and the lax dress code. I see patrons in baseball hats, shorts, wife beaters, etc... I guess the majority (and wallet) rules. It's not a big deal though. I like trying other steakhouses in Vegas but this place will always have my heart, err..stomach.",

Would recommend the peppercorn demi with your steak as they don't come with much seasoning per order but with the peppercorn is was excellent.   See past the hotel being substandard relative to the new spots on the strip and check it out.   Price point is high. Steaks are $50-62 per person but again you can split one quite easily and be filled.",

    "text": "So the main reason I chose to dine at The Steakhouse in the somewhat dingy and now old Circus Circus hotel was due to a very strong recommendation from one of my clients who insisted that this is the place to have some delicious meat--prime rib or steak.  At first, I thought to myself--this place is at the Circus Circus--am I going to fear for the worst?  I gave thought so many times should I or should I not go for a visit...and well, I read so many reviews on Yelp, and decided what the heck--it won't hurt to take my friends out for dinner there.   So this was our third day in Vegas, and we had just completed an adventurous part of the day earlier that afternoon--found a fedora hat for our friend's wedding ceremony, went to the Gun Store to go shoot some machine guns, and now, it was time to get back to the hotel to savor some great food, as I was highly expecting of.  Got dressed up to the dinner, even though yes, it is at the Circus Circus.  It's one of those occasions you just don't want to dress down, and even though Vegas is quite acceptable with any type of attire, clubbing and formal dinners should be dressed to the nines, in my opinion.  We got dressed quickly, and drove out to Circus Circus.  Quite honestly, it used to be a dump, and it hasn't changed much~!  Well, parking wasn't so bad; easier than what I was expecting of.  As we walked into the casino area, the hotel really shows its age, however at the same time, it bought back a lot of memories from when I was a child, when my parents brought me there to play in the arcade, and watch the circus show.  The Steakhouse is hidden in this little area in the middle of the shopping galley, and as soon as you walk into the restaurant, the vibe is very classy Vegas-style.  We were welcomed by the restaurant's manager, Ron, who was very cordial, and friendly.  Because the manager and my client from work are great friends, we received even greater, and exceptional service.  Sat down at the booth, and the bread came.  Wow~!! It's ridiculously delicious.  We were offered bottle of wine, though we opted because we didn't want to get hammered.  Instead, we proceeded to order from the menu.    My two friends ordered the Porterhouse steak, while I ordered the prime rib.  Talk about portions--wow--it's huge!  My meal came with rice pilaf, and vegetables.  Trust me--I was barely able to finish my dinner.  The prime rib meat was so tender--and the light sauce was just right--not too rich, nor too salty.  It was beyond delicious, and for this dinner, I wasn't looking to dine out all big and fancy on the strip.  I really wanted something genuinely delicious, and this place hit the spot.  Besides the food, the service is just phenomenal.  I'd have to say the service is quite etiquette to the nines.    I left this restaurant thinking that it was by far the best meal I've ever had in Vegas.  You definitely get for what you paid, and because it was my friend's bachelor party, I picked up the tab, but no dollar amount should be compared to the food that's served here--it was just so well worth it.  Trust me--I've been to Vegas more than you can count, and yes, by far, this place is now on the top of my list!  Overall grade: A+",

We were stuck in a very long line for a quite awhile even to get into the parking garage. They had one entrance blocked off for no apparent reason.  Handicap parking and valet were both full.  And we asked one of the attendants were the handicap parking was and he was very rude to us.  So we finally parked and then had to make our way into Circus Circus.  There are kids and parents everywhere.  The ceiling is low, the place smells awful, the gambling sucks.  I definitely never need to go back to Circus Circus ever.  So we finally get into the Steakhouse.  We did get a nice table right by the grill area so we could watch what was going on.  The inside of the place is very traditional steakhouse with wood walls, dark furniture and quiet.    I had the filet mingon with double asparagus instead of potato.  It was nicely cooked.  Good flavor, tender.  Asparagus was good too when I don't even really like it.  My mom had the lamb chops. It was a huge portion.  She took half of it home.  She liked her baked potato.  They give you lots of toppings for it.    So I would say this was a good steak place but not great.  I have had much better in Vegas at other restaurants.  And the process to get there sucked.  Never again.",

    "text": "I was skeptical about anything located in tacky Circus Circus. Friends highly recommended this place, so we went, and ---Glad we did!  Hubs and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary here.  Decor is \"old school\", sort of Brat Pack, 60's ambience--  Dark, intimate and comforting.  They have aged meat here, you can see through a glass window all the steaks they are aging.  Service excellent.  Our waiter Richard, and  assistant Ernesto, were top of the line fabulous.... efficient, friendly, just terrific.  Made the dinner so special.  Menu here is \"old school\" as well, nothing fancy or fusion. Appetizers:  My half order of shrimp cocktail-- SUPERB!  two of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, cooked perfectly, and served with a Horseradish Mayo.. YUM!  Hubs ordered Black bean soup with Sherry (very good) and Oysters.  He said he prefers the oysters we get near Seattle-- but still very good.  Our rib eye steaks were cooked to perfection-- char on outside, pink inside.  Garlic mashed potatoes, and asparagus were also sooooo good.  Paired our steaks with glasses of Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon, which went so well.  After gorging ourselves silly, we had a complementary Tiramisu (for our anniversary) which was a perfect ending to the dinner.  A wonderful experience, great food and service.  The best ending:  We then played some craps at the Casino, and unlike a couple other places on the Strip-- we won!!!",

    "text": "The classic steakhouse of yesteryear.    You remember, the kind of place where starters were chilled seafood cocktails.  The place where you could have any kind of soup you wanted as long as it was French onion.  Where every entree came with a salad, a starch and cooked veg.  Where seasoning wass just salt and pepper atop slabs of fire grilled beef, lamb, chicken or fish.  Where ballin out of control meant a big a$$ lobster.  Welcome to THE Steak House.  Yes, it's in the little black sheep of the MGM empire, home to the $25/night room.  Sure the decor is slightly dated and the servers show their patina.  It's still Vegas baby and it delivers.  Starters are simple.  Well cooked, chilled, sweet, jumbo shrimp served with a simple albeit horseradish heavy cocktail sauce; a steakhouse classic.  The French onion soup, showing a great beef broth undertones blending with sweet caramelized onions and sporting the perfect, broiled gruyere cheese topping.  To the real stars, the steaks.  All 21 day, dry aged on site.   Well trimmed.  Four cuts, all grilled over an open mesquite fire.  Excellent sear and always to temp.  The bitterness of the smoke does obscure the subtle umame undertones of the aged beef.  All good.  In the end, it's like a USDA prime backyard BBQ.   Top props to the porterhouse with the bone in ribeye a close second.  Something different?  The bone in prime rib is as good as any.  Juicy, tender, not as well trimmed as the ribeye but classic in every respect (fat is flavor).  Sides are, well sides.  Baked potato with the works, perhaps cooked carrots or asparagus.  No complaints.  Respectable wine list with low Vegas resort markup.    Excellent, steakhouse friendly service.  Snub it if you will.  It will be your loss.",

    "text": "We decided to try The Steak House after seeing that it was ranked high in various reviews. First, let me say, \"Don't let the walk down the corridor to the restaurant influence you!\" Yes, it IS Circus Circus and definitely not where you would expect to find a great steak house. However, after finding it and opening the doors, the first thing that hits you is the amazing smell of grilled steak! We were seated right away and loved the \"old school Vegas\" atmosphere the restaurant had. Our waiter, Roberto was fantastic and personable. He was very helpful with suggestions as to what to order and the food did not disappoint! Surprisingly, the meals are NOT a la carte, they come with bread, salad or soup, entree, and choice of mashed or baked potato, or pilaf and chef's choice of the day vegetable. We chose to share the bone in ribeye and opted for the split plate charge of $20 so that we both got our own salad and sides. The food was prepared perfectly and it was DELICIOUS! We brought our own wine and the corkage fee was only $20, which is almost unheard of at a steakhouse of this caliber in Las Vegas. We had a great meal at a great price. It was definitely comparable or better than the \"famous chef\" steak houses on the strip and a much better value. We will be back on our next visit to Vegas...definitely!",

    "text": "This wasn't my first visit at this restaurant! I had a 6:30 Reservation at The Steak House. So as a returning guest I'm very disturbed by the service I received.  For a $285 meal, this shouldn't have happened. I've ordered the 27 ounce Prime Rib Dinner on multiple occasions to share. (the restaurant gives you the option for $20 extra). The Prime Rib has never came to my table from the kitchen UNCUT. I was caught by surprise when the server informed me that I had to cut this 27 Ounce cut of meat myself. It's always came cut from the KITCHEN for me and one of my guest. After the waiter noticed surprised look on my face and requesting that the kitchen cuts the huge Prime Rib for me, my waiter grabbed MY CUTTING KNIFE AND TRIED TO CUT MY PRIME RIB IN HALF. He grabbed my serving knife off the table and proceeded to try to cut my Prime Rib in front of me. He was literally in my personal space trying to cut my meat how he thought it should be cut. I had to literally tell him once more that I would prefer if the kitchen chefs cut it. He looked irritated. I mean WTF, why would you try to cut my damn prime rib for me? He brought the meat back and it was cut in a way that it should've never been cut. Directly down the middle.  When I've ordered this before on different occasions it has never came to my table looking so rock bottom. It always comes actually cut in a way that looks like an excellent cut of meat. I'm so angry that this waiter literally took my cutting knife and proceeded my cut my 27 OUNCE PRIME RIB STEAK AT MY TABLE. And then we only had 1 AU JUS Sauce to share. We asked for a second one and although the server brung it to us, he did it in a way where it seemed like we were bothering him. I'm very disappointed. And as investor in MGM Resorts properties, in very disappointed in this property. I'll never return.",

    "text": "Steak is a commodity. It's a dish that almost anyone can prepare, so steakhouses normally focus heavily on service and their sides to differentiate themselves. THE Steak House could not even get the steak part right. I would not even feed this garbage to my dog.  I have heard the servers at THE Steak House have been here for decades, and it shows. Everything about our server was slow. Want some bread? That'll be ten minutes. What to order? That'll be 30 minutes. Want the check? Keep dreaming. I should not have to ask a server to move to every next step in the dining process. Absolutely pathetic.  After dealing with our incompetent server for almost an hour, we finally received our food...if that's what you want to call it. Everyone at my table had overcooked steak. If that was not bad enough, the steak was not even uniformly overcooked. Some part of the steak were undercooked while others were overcooked, and all of it was a complete disaster. The sides were nothing special either lacking flavor and seasoning, but certainly not lacking in disappointment. It was not even worth sending anything back- that is how badly we just wanted the meal to be over with.  After finishing our meal we waited...and waited...and waited...and finally when I realized our server crossed into another plane of incompetence, I finally had to ask for our check.  It appears Circus Circus left the door to THE Steak House open one too many times and the circus itself is now running the place. With so many top notch steakhouses in Las Vegas, there just is no reason to patronize THE Steak House.",

No offense to Uncle Bob (R.I.P.), but the $68 porterhouse I paid for recently was EXTREMELY bland (drywall would have tasted better) and not much more tender than an average Walmart steak.    Also the service was too fast.  It felt more like a fast food joint where they herd you quickly through so they can usher in the next group.   We literally received our salads a few minutes after placing our order, then the main course a few minutes thereafter, and the check before finishing our meal.  To make matters worse the restaurant was only at 25% capacity there was no line of people waiting to get in.   Perhaps there was some hidden \"don't rush me\" option on the menu that I missed.  If you're looking to get rushed through your vastly mediocre dinner, don't plan on having a lot of conversation with your party and really enjoy being swindled, then I highly recommend The Steak House.",

The decor definitely brings you back to the days of old Vegas... in a good way.  But we had mixed feelings about the food.  The dry age room was a sight to see if you're a meat eater, and the vibe of the room reminded you of the golden days when the mob ran Vegas instead of today's Corp conglomerates.     Overall, the beef lacked some seasoning, the pour wasn't as generous, and the dessert was only good.  I would expect for the price, everything would be top notch.  However, service was friendly and attentive, and the booths reminded you of the movie, \"Casino\" with Bobby D.    Total rating is 3.75, but always good to round up.

    "text": "First off, this is an old Vegas steakhouse. If you want to be wowed by a celebrity chef (and pay mostly for a name), then don't bother coming here. If you want a really good steak and a step back in time, then come here now.   This place has been a Vegas institution since the 1980s, and most of the staff has been here that long (seriously, ask them). They will gladly talk about the history of the place and point out where notable people have sat in the place when they served them - both times I've been here, I've had lengthy conversations with the staff about the old days of Vegas and other places that carry on the same legacy (like Golden Steer, Michael's and Hugo's Cellar). And don't let the Circus Circus part scare you .. you won't have to pay for parking here and once you get inside the restaurant, you'll completely forget you're inside the hotel.   Food is reasonably priced and the portions are above average sized. The place is not huge, and it is quiet - good for a romantic dinner. You can see the open kitchen from almost anywhere inside as your dinner is prepared. All parts of the menu are very traditional - do not expect over the top presentations or pizzazz; there is not a drink menu, but a bartender that can make any traditional cocktail quite well. The wine list is pretty good sized and priced the way it should be, corkage is an extremely reasonable $20. Entrees come with a salad, starch (the garlic mashed is to die for) and vegetable side, which is a long lost thing in this town. Couples might want to opt for a larger cut of meat and go for the split plate. If you're a prime rib fan, go for it - this is one of the best in town.   No dessert menu, but you'll find the standard items here. Bananas Foster is highly recommended. I'm a little disappointed that they recently got rid of almost all their Port options, but the one they kept is quite tasty if you're into that.   Overall, it's a must do if you can appreciate what this town once was.",

The restaurant easily accommodated our group of 7 (we made a reservation well in advance). The atmosphere was cozy and resembled an old school steakhouse.   What I liked most about the restaurant is that soup/salad, a potato and a vegetable were all included with your meal. Definitely atypical for most modern steakhouses. Everyone in our group \"upgraded\" (additional $6) their soup/salad selection from the included choices of black bean soup or house salad. The Caesar salad was a True standout. The French onion soup was okay (I wished I got the Caesar salad instead). It seems like it was a Swiss and Parmesan cheese topper on the soup and the Parmesan just didn't work.  Our table was split between filets and prime rib. Even the petite cut of prime rib was enough for two people (and I have a big appetite!). We also thought the wine list was reasonably priced.   For dessert our table had the bananas foster and the tiramisu. Both were tasty and the portion size was decent.   Definitely a place we are likely to visit again!",

If you are looking for a True old school steakhouse experience then baby this is it!!! You can actually smell the steak from about 25 yards from the entrance. For real! The servers wear proper tuxedos and from what I understand most have been there for over 20 years. Please do not confuse the family friendly oriented Circus Circus Casino with this very much adult and formal establishment that rests inside. And frankly, you won't find a steak that is much better either!  Since my introduction a couple of years ago, this has been part of my rotation when I'm feeling extra carnivorous! Just whatever you do... include the Seafood Tower!",

I had the potterhouse steak (pictured) with baked potatoe and aspargras.  Salad (pictured) to start with weird wonderful pretzel rolls  (pictured).  Mesquite grilled steak was melt in your mouth. Dumb lucked with table near the grill so could see all the preparations. As you walk in, you can see the meats being cured. Steak part of the menu is pictured.   The atmosphere is old school.  With over stuffed chairs that are incredibly comfortable.  Service was prompt and efficient.    The steakhouse gets very busy, so reservations are recommended.  The only downside was reservation gal's English was not too good,  but was minor problem.  The steakhouse is in the sketchy circus circus casino,  which you may want to avoid.  The steakhouse can be pricey,  but if it was in upscale casino it would be even pricier.   Am not sure of the size of the potterhouse,  but had nice piece to take home.  That with a couple pretzel rolls made a great breakfast.   Worth finding if you are in Vegas.",

The medium rare steak came out more medium well, and they were able to take it back and return with a new steak, done the right way.  All of the sides were delicious.  I'd say this is a recommended place to dine at, it's worth the price.  If you're a gambler, know that you probably spend $100 or more on the tables or slots risking that to win something, most of the time walking away a loser.  You're better off guaranteeing yourself a satisfying meal, treating yourself to something better than a buffet and coming here for a quality meal.  Circus Circus is one of the few hotel casinos in Las Vegas that does not charge for parking, which is an annoying growing trend that I'm sure drives away locals.  It's refreshing to see Circus Circus offer FREE parking.",

    "text": "This was probably my 4th or 5th visit to the aptly named Steak House at Circus Circus... I have tried a couple other establishments in Las Vegas and, so far, none compare.  The first thing that I kind of enjoy is the rough around the edges Circus Circus casino. After trekking through the dated casino at the end if the strip with the somewhat disturbing clown / circus theme (and a very high percentage of small children for a town that is billed as Sin City) you step into another world.  Appropriately subdued environment, intimate bar, comfortable seating... The ideal steak house atmosphere.  Our server, Felix, was a True gentleman. Helpful with wine suggestions and knowledgeable about the menu. There was a slight delay with the entree and, instead if letting us wonder, he let us know what was going on and picked up a round of drinks. A very professional server but also a gentleman that I would like to have a drink with at the bar I think.  On to the food... The shrimp in the cocktail were huge but the shrimp were surprisingly tender. The presentation was excellent... Served in a funky bowl on a bed of ice. The lemon was wrapped in a yellow cheese cloth (I assume to keep seeds from falling into the food.) The cocktail sauce was perfect. A little more with the horseradish than most places but not enough to hurt those with delicate sensibilities... Most cocktail sauces taste like ketchup to me... Not here. Just right.  The lettuce and vegetables in the salad were very fresh and crisp and the Thousand Island dressing (must've been house made) was the best I've had. It's usually hard to get excited about a side salad but I really enjoyed this one.  My 8 oz filet was, in a word, perfect. Lightly charred just right on the outside and a warm, pink medium rare inside. Possibly the best filet that I've ever had... The bearnaise was an ideal compliment.  I'm not generally an asparagus fan but the stalks were thin and crunchy. Great flavor combined with the steak. I was almost disappointed when it was gone.  A baked potato is a baked potato but it was accompanied with plentiful butter, sour cream, fresh chives and crispy bacon. So big that I could only eat half.  I wish I could tell you about desert but I just didn't have it in me. What passed by with the servers looked fantastic and I think I heard a little sigh if delight from the table across from us... Some sort of multi-layer chocolate cake I think. Looked great   The Steak House is not flashy or trendy. It's expensive but dinners include salad, vegetable and starch so it's actually reasonably priced for a higher end establishment. I will definitely be back every time I come to Las Vegas!",

The Caesar salad is really delicious and large enough to split. The person assisting the waiter was so hard working and kind. The waiter didn't seem to care about anything.  Now to the food. Steak ( filet) was fire grilled and delicious. The salmon was ok. The sides are limited. No specialty drinks or martinis. The restaurant was old and tired. Over all not worth going to because there are so many delicious options for food in Vegas. I highly recommend going somewhere else for the same money. Also circus circus is awful and dirty. :(. So sad to have waisted our money here.  Sadly it was probably a great restaurant in its day but that day has passed!!",

This year the 3 stars was for the rushed and inattentive service by our waiter MIKE.  The host greeted me with a \"happy birthday\" and sat me and party (2 of us) at the table, 12 minutes went by before Mike came to take the drink order and meal order at the same time.  We were still eating our salads when the steaks were brought, but had little to no interaction with the waiter during the meal. Drinks sat empty twice for awhile before refills were brought. The assistant kept busy refilling water glasses, but the drinks purchased were not filled promptly.  I ordered my steak medium, but the middle was cooked medium rare. I was almost finished with my steak when the waiter Mike stopped by to ask how everything was (for the first time after bringing the food).  Not very attentive and felt rushed. Not wished a happy birthday by our waiter as in years past, and not given a slice of birthday cake as in years past.  Steak was tender, but no flavor to it unfortunately.  We were brought the bill without asking for it, or asked if we liked anything else (drink refill maybe?)  Heard other another table celebrating a birthday, but was overlooked this visit.",

    "text": "Wow! Their name, while seemingly self-serving, appears to also be pretty accurate. This is THE steak house that I want to go back to the next time I'm in Vegas. I only ended up here because it was the first result when we looked up \"Steak House\" so the name has its perks!  Located in the back of Circus Circus, the surroundings are pretty incongruous with the relatively upscale nature of this place and the wall of plaques and accolades you see as you come in.  But on to the main event! The important thing here is the steak, and boy is it worth the asking price.  Prime rib, bone in, medium rare - absolutely perfect, tender, and melts in your mouth. Au jus, creamy horseradish, and regular horseradish to compliment nicely. Comes with sides, which are good but totally unnecessary for me given the portion size I was dealing with. Come hungry, or be prepared to share! I didn't get an ounce count but it was big enough that as a big eater I was still worried about being able to finish it. Don't fill up on the bread, salad, or soup if this is a concern - you'll want all that space to savor the main course!   I also tried a bit of the ribeye, which was good but in my opinion gets beaten out by the prime rib handily. They were the same price at $68 a pop so that's my recommendation if you are choosing between the two.  You pay a bit of a premium, not the worst, and I came away feeling like it was totally worth it. 5 stars",

We arrived to Circus Circus about half an hour early and decided to play a little and look around. That casino was a madhouse full of rude people and their annoying 10+ children. I kept having to tell myself that a tasty steak was awaiting me! When if was finally time, the hostess seated us quickly and politely. Our waiter made my boyfriend and I feel like millionares! What service! Super nice guy and the restaurant had a very fancy-cozy atmosphere. Where we were seated we were able to watch their chef grill our steaks. Even the salad was fancy! Best. Steak. Ever. We had the prime rib and the ribeye. The prime rib was very tender and juicy with a very yummy au jous (cant spell that!) The ribeye had a perfect char and an incredible flavor. The asparagus was crisp and delicious and dont even get me started on the potatoes! Yum! If anyone is hankering for an incredible steak and is willing to put up with the zoo to get there, I would recommend this, bar none!",

    "text": "I go to this steakhouse in circus circus once a year with my family every year for the last four years. We come from CA so this is a must do when we are in Vegas. Every time we go we love it and that's why we always come back. The steak is always delicious, but the service this time lacked some attention. First the waiter who poured our water, poured so far from the glass water splashed all over the wine and dinner menus. It could of been prevented by just lowering the arrowhead water bottle closer to the glass. My New York steak was ordered medium. It came out very rear and very pink. Then Usually after dinner we order coffee. Our plates get cleared and the waiter was supposed to clean off the table crumbs so we could have our coffee. We sat there with a dirty table cloth sipping our coffee. Sorry steakhouse, dissatisfied. It wasn't even a busy night for them. It was on a Sunday night at 7:30.",

    "text": "Value+service+delicious food=5 stars  When my husband wanted to try the \"Circus Circus Steakhouse\", I told him he must be crazy. I'm way too prissy to eat at Circus-Circus. But, I took one for the team, and I sure was glad! Now, we eat here almost every time we go to Vegas! Yes, you will pay $50 for your meal. But, unlike other expensive steakhouses, your dish will come with a salad, a vegetable and a starch--I suggest the baked potato with all the fixin's. Most other steakhouses are a la carte, and once you add in the salad and sides, your $50 dish has become a $75 dish. So the value is there.  I will say that if you like a broiled steak, you may not enjoy the \"charred\" flavor on their steaks. It's not a burnt flavor, it's just different than a broiled steak. I actually prefer their crab legs over the steaks. You get a HUGE plate of King crab legs, and they come completely split in half length-wise, so the meat is ready for you. A variety of breads are brought to your table and they are all amazing! The waiters are all super-friendly and my water glass never got more than half-empty. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "In the few times I have been to Circus Circus with friends and have walked past this place I have always laughed and thought to myself what kind of idiot would eat at an \"upscale\" restaurant at this hotel? Well, I am the idiot for thinking that. The Steakhouse is bar far the best steakhouse I have ever been to, better than Smith and Wollensky up the strip and right up there with Mortons in Beverly Hills.   The decor is awesome, it feels like you are stepping into a speakeasy in the roaring 20's. It is all dark wood, a brass fixtures. The have a glass aging room where you can see the meat being aged to what really is perfection. They also have their kitchen in the middle of the dining room so you can see the chefs work, and they do work hard,   The food is amazing, from the basket of warm bread to the Caesar salad to the entree itself. I got a filet and couldn't finish it, it was that big. Unlike many of their competitors, they include the soup or salad and sides with the steak so you get a huge portion at a good price. Dessert was also huge and spectacular. Try the chocolate or cheesecake, you won't be sorry.   Service was also stellar. There is always someone refilling your glass with bottled water (no charge) and we had a very nice and knowledgeable waiter. The best part of all was that while they were attentive, they did not hover.   The person at the valet mentioned that the owner of Boyd casinos eats here. I can see why.  Next time I am in Vegas, I will be back.   P.S. Reservations are a must. The manager at the Players Club got us in, but without her, we would have missed this amazing dinner.",

    "text": "First thing is first..Don't let this steakhouse leave the picture because it's located in the Circus Circus. Yes, you have to work your way through the \"Circus\" crowd but in the end it is well worth it. My dad's boss is a Vegas resident and swears by the place which is where we got the idea to go. We were down from Reno for the UNLV-Nevada game and wanted to have a good dinner without the Vegas price tag. We are college students so all the high priced \"stewey\" steakhouses were out of the question.   Walking in you get the feel of an old school steakhouse which is what we wanted. The smell of beef slaps you in the face the moment you get to the receptionist.   We also wanted a place where dress was considered. We wanted to celebrate and look nice doing it! Some reviews on here have stated that people walk in with shorts and button up shirts...This wasn't the case when we went. Every person in the restaurant was dressed \"up\".  I'm not going in depth about the food because I'm not a food critic and won't pretend to be one, but to sum it up we all had Filet's and they were cooked to perfection. The best part about this place is that your steak actually comes with a side and salad!  All in all we had a great experience. If your looking for a steakhouse that isn't going to hammer your wallet this is your spot.",

The fact that it is in Circus Circus and there are many kids running around outside should not take away from the ambiance and atmosphere of this place.

The service was unbelievably good with many waiters constantly attenting to the table refilling drinks and whatever else is needed.

I hadn't heard much about it as a Vegas local but was hoping for the best.   4 stars for the ambiance its that old red leather dark Mobby Italian renaissance decor that makes you yearn for the Vegas of the past. 4 stars also for the wait staff who is professional and hard working and striving to make sure you never have an empty glass and just the perfect amount of banter.  Ok now for the bad news, the food was only 2 stars.  While there we had:  The Spinach Salad with hot bacon dressing - this was nothing special definitely more deserving to be highlighted at a mid market family restaurant.  The Chopped Salad- decent but again nothing special.  Petite Filet w garlic mashed and green beans- Sorry can't use the words great to describe it . The green beans were the standout.  Porterhouse- Not cooked correctly filet Ok but other side tough and overcooked which in my mind is completely ridiculous for a steak house where you are paying 50 plus for a steak.  Desserts- looked good but frankly after being underwhelmed by  dinner didn't take the plunge.  Final issue, was when we were done we were at the CIrcus Circus not anywhere to grab a quiet after drink. except the bar in restaurant",

The meat is on displace aging in temperature controlled glass lockers for your viewing pleasure.  The red booths are what give it the throwback look with the kitchen grill on full display in the middle.  The meat is aged 21 days without spices...  That being said, this place is very good if you like your meat rare to medium rare as the flavors really come out.  Anything above medium and you will have a burnt tasteless piece of meat on your plate.  This place is old school and everything is ala cart and should be shared, the bone in Rib Eye is very good.  I am a purist when it comes to meat so butter, excess salt, or marinade on my steak...I will pass.  In other words Ruth Chris' type places are awful to me.  I'd say this place is on par with Morton's of Chicago, Flemming's, etc.  price-wise too.  Guess there is a reason The Steak House was voted top Steak House in Vegas 20 years in a row...20 years.",

Located in the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, Its entrance looked quite elegant for its surroundings.. Walking in, there's a room that exposed raw cattle hanging from the ceiling ready to be charbrioled and served. I thought that was interesting. We got seated promptly and our waiter was very polite.   I ordered the Ribeye steak with a side of  mashed potato (my usual combination). The bread was decent and house salad was good. The steak came shortly afterwards and had that charbroiled aroma to it. It was a hefty piece and had the right amount of char. The steak was pretty tender, juicy and had an all natural steak flavor. Overall it  was better than average but  not spectacular. The mashed potatoes were mediocre. The wine did help with the whole experience..  Oldschool Steakhouse that still Holds its own..",

Two of our group ordered bone in Rib Eye steaks and when the arrived at the table we thought they must have messed up the order because they looked completely different from each other, one had a big bone showing and the other had a small bone that you literally had to hunt for. I ordered a filet and out of all the filets I have had in my life I have never seen a filet that looked like this (looked like a very small tri tip) it was like a small triangle. I ordered my ($60.00) filet medium rare and it was medium to well done very chard on the outside with no flavor (all you could taste was the char). I have to tell you that I have never paid $350.00 dollars for four steak dinners where not one person at our table could finish close to half of their steaks. Dried out and no flavor!  Believe me..... I don't have a problem spending that kind of money on a steak dinner, but it should be an experience that you brag about when your finished. We didn't even want our leftovers.

I can't think of any other place where I can view my steak in a glass walk-in cooler and then see it grilled right in the middle of the dinning room.    Everything we ate was amazing.  We started with a seafood appetizer with halved king crab legs and the biggest shrimp I've seen in a while.  I highly recommend the french onion soup but make sure you eat it hot before the cheese cools too much.  I tried the filet mignon, medium rare, with hollandaise sauce and it was incredible.  They really grill it to perfection however you like your steak.  The only other place that can compete to this experience is STK but that is because I prefer a younger atmosphere.

The thing that made The Steak House stand out was that sides come WITH your steak, so there's no democratic vote that has to go on at your table as to who wants a jacket potato, who wants mashed potatoes, and who won't eat asparagus so don't bother getting it.  We had a 7:00 reservation but were at the mercy of the bus service,  and while  we showed up 20 minutes late and very apologetic, we were still shown to a table immediately. YAY!   So for everyone's future reference: The ACE doesn't stop in front of Circus Circus-- you think it will but then it takes a right and goes waaay away from the strip only to come back at the Stratosphere. You have to transfer to the DEUCE to backtrack, or you have to take the DEUCE all the way down.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail that consisted of 4 gigantic shrimp, and filled up on rolls-- OH THE PRETZEL ROLLS! My husband ordered the filet and he deemed it fabulous, and my salmon was quite tasty as well. We were too full for dessert. Service was attentive but not snooty, and we just had a good meal in general. :)",

I prefer a little more seasoning or pizazz on my meat and truly look forward to the little surprises other dining options have to offer. A few things I did enjoy were the grill being out in the open for all to see and the dessert table. They also include sides with their entree choices which makes it an affordable steak option.

It is hard to ignore the walk through the casino all dolled up for a fancy restaurant when everything around is stinky and cartoonish.    However, once you arrive to the doors of The Steakhouse you are made exclusive.  You will be greeted and escorted to your table.  The team of waiters were there at every beck and call without me really having to make any requests at all.  I ordered the petite filet mignon which was still huge.  For an appetizer, oysters on a half shell which were also great.  I will be back again!  This place has my heart!",

But then, he's never been in Circus Circus.  I, of course, took him up to the Midway, so he could get a good feel for the place.  With his nerves shattered, the ice-cold perfectly constructed martini we were served once seated was much appreciated.  As were the perfectly cooked, humongoid steaks.  I preferred his ribeye to my porterhouse - his steak was thicker and had a much better sear on it.  Both cost about $50 with salad/soup and potato included.  Corkage was only $20 - so the damage to our considerably lightened wallets was minimal.",

    "text": "Had a dinner reservation at 5pm last night. Our waiter Richard was top notch. He catered to anything we needed and was super attentive. We ordered the grilled garlic shrimp for our appetizer. It comes with 4 large shrimp and a side of lemon and garlic butter. Cooked perfectly and the garlic butter is a must, ecen though the shrimp on their own are tasty. My husband had the porterhouse, baked potato, carrots, and black bean soup. The porterhouse is huge, so be hungry! I had the bone in rib eye medium rare, carrots, garlic mashed potatos and salad. The rib eye, also huge, is to die for. The steaks had that perfect char taste. The don't season their steaks, which I saw some yelpers complain about, but I guess they dont get that The Steak House wants you to get the flavor of the meat, not the salt or a marinade. The salad is your run of the mill cripy veggies. The black bean soup was very tasty, served with a side of onions and dry sherry. The potato and veggies come with your meal as well, not ala carte like most steak houses. The veggies is always the chefs choice. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake which was decadent. He had the key lime mousse which was good, but very sweet and a tad overwhelming. Make sure you really like key lime a lot before ordering. It is huge.  Overall, great food, great service, and a great hidden gem to check out. Highly suggested over the snooty, over priced steak houses that lack service.",

You are greeted by your waiter and given complimentary bottled water.  They also provide a yummy bread basket, must try the pretzel bread!  The food was wonderful the prices were great, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it was so smokey.  I am not talking cigar or cigarette smoke, it's smokey because the chef cooks in the middle of the restaurant.  Now don't get me wrong it looks really cool, but after the meal and the next morning I was coughing felt like I had smoked a cigar or something.  So if smoke doesn't bother you then you'll love this place.  It is wonderful just be prepared.    8oz filet was $38  12oz filet was $48  *all entrees come with choice of black bean soup (which is delicious) or salad *garlic mashed potatoes (so good), baked potato, or rice pilaf *chef's veggies  **We did not get an appetizer and we were full... still couldn't finish everything on our plates!!!!  *****Great food, great price, amazing portions!",

As other reviewers mentioned, it requires you to pass through the seedy/trashy casino of the hotel.  The restaurant itself is very dark and in need of a more modern decor.    I ordered the NY Strip Steak, which was huge.  It wasn't the best or worst steak I've ever had, but for $47, I guess I expected better.  The Pina Colada I had was okay- couldn't taste any rum (maybe they gave me a virgin one by accident due to my baby face?)    I'm sure there are much better, more atmospheric steakhouses in LV...",

Ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer -- the whole order had 4 shrimp so a little pricy ($23) but they tasted really good. Ordered one medium rare ribeye and one lobster tail. The steak was on the fatty side and was too charred for my taste but still rare on the inside -- very good but not as great as expected for $58. The lobster tail was a little overcooked so it was a tiny bit chewy but the portion was very generous (also $58). Service was decent. Overall very nice dinner out.",

After walking through the casino and thinking yuck! We stumbled upon this diamond in the rough.   We were able to be seated without reservations. My wife ordered the petite Prime Rib and I thought about what petite would be (small) so I ordered the regular Prime Rib. When they brought her plate, her portions were the size that I thought I was ordering. The petite was a very generous portion. The waiter brought my plate and jokingly laughed and said \"You have to eat this in 15 minutes.\" MY eyes bugged out of my head and I thought about the show \"Man VS Food\"! That piece of meat was about 2\" thick and covered what seemed to be 3/4 of the plate. But It was quite tasty. Needless to say that I didn't finish it and I didn't need to go out for dinner or lunch for the rest of the week! The garlic mashed potatoes were great, but I thought the vegetable portion was lacking based on the size of the meat portion.  My suggestion if you're ordering the Prime Rib. You'll be satisfied with the petite.",

Of course, compared to the rest of the hotel your neighborhood Applebee's is a rather upscale and classey place...  But on to the restaurant itself - interior is dark wood, kind of with a British hunt club feel. You know, classic steakhouse?   The food - well, ehh.  The steaks themselves were good cuts and cooked as ordered but, and I jest not, no flavor whatsoever.  I had to put salt and pepper on my ribeye.  That's really not acceptable at a high end steakhouse.   Also, the house Cab  ( I just had a glass as the person with was not a wine drinker) was rather cheap tasting. Basically a glass of Two Buck Chuck for about $8 or something like that.  On the plus side it's not as expensive as most of the town's other higher end steakhouses - the steaks do come with a side dish -  however, this really isn't a top notch steakhouse.  It's more or less middle of the road. For that it's sort of pricey.  I understand that this place was, for a number of years, (note the past tense) voted one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  Sorry my friend, thise days are long gone.",

It was great because while driving there she joked \"what we are going to circus circus to eat\" and when I said yes she didn't believe me.  When I turned into the casino parking lot the atmosphere of the car dropped about 20 degrees.  I could read her thoughts, \"I cannot believe I got dressed up to go here, he's in so much trouble and so on\".    The Steak House not only crushed those thoughts but made me out to be superman for the day with a year long get out of jail free card.  Once you walk in you are definitely not in Kansas or Circus Circus anymore.  Dark lighting, wood and leather ruled the day.  Behind the hostess station is a classed room where you can see them dry aging the meat.  As we were seated we walked by a raised area where you could see them cooking the steaks over an open mesquite wood flame.    Next great point was the attentive service.  And, finally a bartender that actually knows how to mix a proper Tom Collins without having to ask me.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, the bake potato came with do it yourself toppings. the different breads were delicious.  Overall it was a great experience that is definitely a gem hidden in a \"pile\".",

    "text": "This was my 5th, and LAST time here. The first 4 times I came here were amazing. Old school Vegas feel, amazing quality meat, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff, perfectly cooked food. NOT this time.  It's been about 2 years since my last visit, and things have gone WAY down hill! When we walked in the lady up front was too busy on the phone to acknowledge us, so we patiently waited. After about five minutes I started to wander over to the aging room, which apparently got her attention enough for her to finish her phone call. I had made reservations on Open Table two months ahead, and she seated us. Lucky us that we got the worst waiter in Las Vegas! This guy obviously hated food, and hated his job. I ordered the Rib Eye which comes with asparagus. I asked him for barnaise sauce. The food comes out, NO SAUCE. I remind the waiter that I had asked for barnaise sauce, he replies that its on there. I said, \"really? Ive never seen invisible barnaise!\" Can you please bring some extra? He comes out 15 minutes later with some brown sauce that looked like gravy. I said \"what is this?\" he tells me its barnaise. I said no, barnaise is yellow. He tells me that he is positive its barnaise and then walks away.  The quality of the meat was mediocre at best. My steak was actually tough. The seafood we ordered tasted like it had just been thawed out. The only redeeming part of the meal was the salad.  I think I'm just going to try and remember the good times and NEVER come back.",

In a steakhouse with this fine of a rating I would expect nothing less than at least warm, if not fresh baked bread for the table.  Steak was decent.  Cooked the way I asked for it.  But not overwhelmingly delicious.  I guess the price is right as this steakhouse bill wasn't as high as top notch steak houses but I guess you get what you pay for.  If I'm in Vegas I'll stick to what I know and go to Del Friscos Double Eagle steakhouse on paradise road.  Simply the best steaks in Vegas.",

The rest of the casino, at least every time I've been there, is... well... not my thing.  Going in this time, yup, still not my thing. Even this restaurant really looked awful - was very much questioning the decision of my foodie friend leading this group.  Sat down and they didn't get me a napkin. The waiter had never heard of Hendrick's gin. He screwed up the martini order. They misplaced every single one of our dishes (we weren't moving around or anything). The wine selection was not  that great.  And I absolutely don't care about any of that - the filet that I had was incredible. Cooked perfectly, and easily one of the best steaks I'd ever had - and the price wasn't bad (although, to be fair, we had eaten at Picasso the night before).  They do have other stuff on the menu, but why would you bother?  I'll certainly go back.",

Nestled in a dark corner past the dirty casino, dollar blackjack, and screaming kids is a doorway that leads back through time. THE Steak House at Circus Circus is a local legend, a True hidden gem known only to Vegas insiders and locals. When I say the restaurant is a time machine, I mean it. The Rat Pack could easily have haunted it at one point; indeed, it's the sort of place Don Draper and Roger Sterling would frequent. If you're a Mad Men fan, I don't think I need to say any more. But I will.   The waitstaff are seasoned professionals that will attend to your every need. They are happy to make a recommendation from the extensive wine list, and never need any further guidance upon hearing the words, \"rye old fashioned.\" I wasn't even able to finish half my glass of water before it was refilled.   The menu is simple, as it should be. Traditional steakhouse fare. For around $50 (give or take), you'll get a superb cut of aged midwestern beef, cooked to perfection, served with a salad or soup, potato, and vegetable. I'm picky when it comes to steak, and every meal I've had at THE Steak House has been fantastic. My personal favorite is the ribeye, but they make a great filet as well. A friend of mine enjoys the lobster. I've never had dessert, although I have ordered coffee after the meal and it is very good.   You will walk away stuffed. You will leave, make your way back through the unwashed masses, hail a cab toward the opposite end of the strip, and feel like you're part of an elite club.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas Thanksgiving week and this was the highlight of our trip. I've been to a seafood buffet, which was very good, Italian restaurants, cheap eats, etc. and I must say this was the best place I went to. A large Portehouse steak, just enough marbling, luscious and juicy. No frills meal; great sides, included. Hostess was an attractive slim woman with a Central European accent; my guess is Czech. She was very nice and fast with the service. Wait staff also equally professional, kind, and alert. Prices were honest and not just to pay for a fancy place or to fatten a celebrity chefs wallet. I have a beef with these celeb. chefs. What do they do? They cook. They claim it is art. BS. Art survives the test of time; their \"art\" won't survive anyone's bite. So I really am not nor will not make any Gordon Ramsay, Collichio, Battali, whatever whatever any richer for their overpriced meat and preparations. I also hate it when they put down people on their shows, that's why. Any person can cook, maybe not be a chef, but anyone can cook. But not everyone can fly a plane. Or perform surgery. Or design a skyscraper. So you high priced Vegas chefs you can stuff it, this place will kick your behinds any day as far as taste, presentation, value, and overall experience.",

The place was very clean and simplistic. I appreciate this because so many places now are crammed with crap.   The wait staff was very soft spoken and attentive, i like the calm approach rather then then crazy loud \"fun\" approach at some chain restaurants.   Steak was perfect, no complaints about the food. It had real flavor and didn't need any extras which in my opinion is a sign of quality.   Check the price, if it is within budget definitely a must go place.",

    "text": "I heard about this restaurant through a friend, and saw many ads along the Las Vegas I-15 freeway that rated it as one of the top steakhouses for the last 20 years or so. Knowing this, I assumed that this place would be really good. My boyfriend and I love to eat steak, and were excited about going here.   First of all, it is not a place for couples to go. It had a very \"old\" ambiance to it, red leather booths, dark wood panels, pictures of cows, etc. There were no \"couple\" seatings, but mostly tables and booths made for 4 people. When I glanced at the menu, I was surprised to find out that a side of vegetables, salad, or soup were included with the steak, in addition to rice pilaf, garlic mashed potatoes (that was the best I've tasted in a while), or a baked potato. I ordered the Porterhouse and my boyfriend ordered the Rib-eye. Each steak was priced at about $44-47.  We were first brought a basket of different types of bread that were delicious. After we ate almost all the bread, we were brought our salads. Then the steaks came....I ordered mine Medium rare....but to my surprise, it was almost rare in many parts of the steak...the steaks were practically burnt on the top and bottom....and there was no special taste from the meat in general. The steak tasted like a slab of meat that you can just buy at any store and cooked on a home grill! I was very disappointed. If anything, the best thing I had there to eat was the garlic mashed potatoes.   Despite the lack of taste of the steaks, the service was superb! I heard that the filet mignon was the best thing on the menu. This is also offered on their Sunday Champagne brunch at 930, 1130, 130 (Reservations recommended). The cost is about $35 for it, and offers many other buffet style entrees. The filet mignon is priced at about $55 or so, so the buffet price doesn't even touch that. Next time, I would probably just go for the buffet.",

So finally i said okay let's go and try this place out.   Of course it's not the best location. Circus Circus was an old casino hotel. i used to come here so many times with my family when i was a young kid. it did bring back memories and seeing how much our lives have changed. Growing up poor and working our asses off and now we realized how much that hard working pays off and we are all living comfortably and happily.  I walked into the restaurant and you can smell the steaks. Smelled really good which got my stomach growling. I liked the old school vegas feel to the restaurant with the dim lights and mahogany colors. There was a grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chef prepare the steaks which i liked a lot.  My dad ordered the NY steak, mom the filet, Mark the rib eye, and myself the king crab legs (since i knew i was going to have some of their steaks). all the steaks were cooked perfectly to our likings. I would NOT order the crab legs. they came out not too warm and for the price of $62.00 definitely not worth it! Staff was very friendly and nice. Our waiter reminded me of Drew Carry ehehee.  It's hard to really love this place since i've been to the best steakhouses like SW and Prime to name a few. BUT if you're looking for something good yet casual with an old school vegas this place is it.  The price is just the same as any other fine dining steakhouses though. so if you don't want to pay up to something like a fine dining steakhouse this place is not for you.",

    "text": "Wow. This place is a little hidden treasure inside of Circus Circus. Upon our arrival, we received a complimentary bottle of house wine, but that wasn't the best part. The steak, aged 21 days, was excellent. I'm impressed. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. The crab, oysters and shrimp appetizers were great too, but we were nearly full when the steak came. The service was excellent. The waiter checked in on us just the right amount of times and was very friendly.  There are many choices in Las Vegas to get a great steak, but if you're in the area, definitely stop by The Steakhouse.",

Best deal and best food in Vegas! Wonderful atmosphere! Old Vegas feel...Also when you walk in the smell is down right divine! Ask for Alfredo- he was wonderful and paid attention to detail!",

    "text": "The good - My server was personable and attentive. The bad - My steak was desperately lacking in seasoning. The meh - The whole atmosphere feels rushed and not very welcoming.  I really wanted to like this supposed \"hidden gem\" in the downscale Circus Circus.  It had all the hallmarks of a good old fashioned, throwback steakhouse in a city full of glitzy temples of beef worship.  Unfortunately THE Steakhouse fell short.    I'm a firm believer that your experience as a diner begins at the host desk and the woman running this show was hurried and not friendly or especially welcoming.  Instead of greeting me she remain glued to the monitor as she asked for my name.  Wow, am I bothering you?  Your major job is greet people (fail!) and to know what tables you have and where tables are in service.  Stop relying on the computer and use your brain.  I had to wait for my table but to be fair I messed up my time and arrived an hour early.  A man who was also working the host stand - manager? - managed to get me in a little early and that was very much appreciated.  BUT!  I decided to wait in the bar and despite sitting at the banquette for 45 minutes the bartender never once acknowledged me or inquired if I wanted a drink.  There are 10 seats at the bar.  He can't possibly be that busy.  I do like the decor of THE Steakhouse.  Lots of wood panelling and rich green walls with dimly lit wall sconces.  Unfortunately the harried rushing around by the staff is at odds with the private club vibe.  I was finally summoned to my table by the man-host.  He walked briskly ahead of me and left me to keep up.  When he got to my table he sort of half-heartedly pulled my chair out, dumped the menus, and was on his way back to the host stand before I even arrived at the table.  He did toss a \"enjoy your dinner\" over his shoulder as he hurried past me.    Not feeling especially welcome but resigned to at least enjoy a good steak, I settled myself in and was promptly greeted by a back-waiter who delivered some water.  Side note - an one of my pet peeves - it only takes a few seconds longer to make sure a table is set neatly with the silverware aligned and the lamp and salt and peppers neatly placed.  This table looked like it had been reset on the hurry with the silverware sloppily placed.  The salt and pepper were all the way at the edge of the table where they had been pushed to reset the table and the lamp shade was crooked.  First impressions people!  Left to my own devices I started perusing the menu.  It's not an especially expansive selection but it's got something for everyone.  I was on the hunt for steak and that's where I headed.  New York Strip, Porterhouse, Bone-in Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, and Prime Rib with two sizes.  All steaks come with a choice of soup or salad, potato or rice, and daily veg.  I opted for a Porterhouse with a $6 upgrade to the Bleu Cheese Wedge, baked potato and asparagus.  Next up the wine list.  Disappointing is the word that comes to mind.  I think any good steakhouse should have an equally good wine list.   Here I found a limited by the glass selection with no vintages listed and the main list was an odd collection that looked like it was either leftovers from a previously good list or was put together for the restaurant by a beverage rep - an all too common occurrence.  At an rate, I ordered an adequate but forgettable cabernet by the glass.  After ordering and receiving my wine, I settled in to wait for dinner to commence.  A basket of bread was delivered and another cardinal rule was violated.  What the hell am I supposed to do with ice cold butter?  I can't spread it.  Butter should always be served at room temperature.  Details are the make or break for a good restaurant.  My salad was delivered promptly and was pretty good.  Excellent ratio of dressing to lettuce and the bleu cheese and bacon crumbles were tasty.  But once again there's a big old \"but\".  Do not bring my entree while my salad plate is still sitting on the table and then swap them out.  Clear my salad plate.  Give me a few minutes to enjoy my wine and then deliver my steak.  I really hate being rushed like that in a supposedly good restaurant.  And, the steak.  First the good - it was cooked perfectly for temperature and it was a respectably hefty size  But, for a supposedly 21-day dry aged steak there was almost no aged flavor and the lack of seasoning was absolutely shocking.  I shouldn't ever have to reach for salt and pepper for a steak and this one forced me to do that.  It was also dry and honestly pretty disappointing for $66.  Not bad, mind you.  Just not especially good.  The accompanying potato and asparagus were ordinary but tasty but when the main attraction falls short the supporting players can't save the experience.  So.....needless to say I'm not going to be rushing back to THE Steak house.  Oh, hell.  Let's be honest - I'm never going back.  For $120 out the door for one person I'll take my $$$ somewhere else.",

The decor is rich with romantic lighting, red leather seats, an open kitchen, and an \"old classic Vegas vibe\" in the best way. The service was impeccable. It was my boyfriends birthday so they gave us a premier table, and a free chocolate cake that was to die for. The steak filet was one of the best I've ever had and I've been lucky enough to eat high quality steaks all over the world! We also shared the crab cake which was to die for, as well as the spinach salad with bacon dressing. I'm gonna go again and again!!!! 5 Stars!!!!!",

As other reviews stated, you do get your choice of salad and side items included with the price of the steak (no a la carte upcharge like at other places)  The steak was great - we ordered the porterhouse for two, and got the extra sides to be able to split the steak.  Wedge salad, asparagus and baked potato...all prepared well.  My girlfriend did have a glass of wine.  Our total bill was a little over $100 - don't remember if that included tip or not (she paid!)  It was a great experience.  It's a great contrast between the normal look of Circus Circus and the steak house.  Don't let that scare you away.  Once you enter the doors it's like a different classy world that you would expect for such a great place to eat.",

    "text": "It had been 6 or so years since I last stepped foot in Circus Circus.  One of Eric R.'s best friends Aimee H. came to Vegas with her boyfriend, best friend, and another couple to celebrate her 30th birthday.  She invited Eric R., my brother Jeffrey L., and I to join all of them for dinner to celebrate her birthday at Circus Circus' The Steakhouse.  I was skeptical but went ahead and put on the same outfit I wore on my birthday (LBD with a giant bow in front and rainbow glitter heels with bows on them).  I was relieved to see carpet when my last memory was of the Adventure Dome's sticky floors.  We traversed through this casino to the restaurant, which immediately brought us into Old School Vegas, dimly lit with green sconces and lamps.  The three of us arrived first (and 15 minutes late for reservation) because we had locked our car and house keys in our place and thought we would have to cab it over, but our condo manager was nice enough to come over on a Saturday and give us a back-up key so we didn't have to sleep in the hallway.  The birthday group had troubles getting their car from valet at their hotel so they were late too.  The bread basket had pretzel rolls which made me happy, and the butter had Longhorns on each pad - Hook Em Horns!  Our server was Ray, specially requested by Aimee H. because her parents come here when in Vegas and he is the guy to have.  He was excellent!  Eric R. shared a bottle of Asti Spumante in celebration, but the rest of the table got free wine bottle coupons from a nearby table and got some house cab and chardonnay.  Eric R. and I both like filet mignon, so we opted to share a 12 oz filet, and he added a lobster tail.  There is a $15 split fee but Ray waived it because he is awesome.  The plates came with salad or soup, choice of mashed potato, baked potato, or rice, and asparagus.  I got baked potato and house salad, Eric R. got rice and Caesar salad.  My brother got the oysters on the half shell app (6 to order) and a petite filet.  The house salad had beets on it, which I immediately thought was cool.  Ray provided triple peppercorn and cheddar sauces plus all baked potato condiments on the side.  Our plates came out perfectly split (including the lobster, which I immediately return to Eric R.'s plate to make sure he was happy), and we got 6 oz of filet, plenty of asparagus, a lemon to squeeze wrapped nicely, and our side.  I was pleased to see fresh chives to add the potato.  I did a little butter, the cheddar cheese sauce (since there was no cheese condiment), and chives.  The combo was just perfect.  After our meals (where almost all of us took a to go bag), Aimee H. selected her free dessert from the cart (chocolate raspberry torte) and we sang to her with the candle lit.  Then we all nibbled on the dessert and left quite satisfied.  Overall, the cost was quite reasonable (Eric R. figured since we did not each get a steak, we could splurge on the wine), the food was good, and the service was amazing.  Definitely get in Ray's section if you ever plan to dine here!",

It was not on the menu but Roberto asked the chef to make it for me.  Hubby got the Porterhouse. The meal comes with soup or salad. I had the ceasar salad which was an up charge but it was really good.  My hubby had the spinach salad. Also an up charge. Also comes with a bread basket and your choice of a baked potato with all the fixing, rice, or garlic mashed potatoes along with asparagus.  I had the garlic mashed potatoes. They were creamy and delicious. Hubby had the baked potato which comes with a side little garnish bar that includes FRESH hot bacon bits.  Yummy. So the steaks.... oh the steaks....  Hubbys porterhouse was HUGE!! He really enjoyed it and said it was cooked perfectly and flavored well.  My filet was really good. It was very flavorful, however I did have to chew it a little bit longer than I like to chew my food. Im not a big steak eater, but when I get a filet, i expect it to melt in your mouth. Although the steak was really seasoned well, it didnt melt in my mouth. Thus the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.  All in all I really enjoyed my meal and I would eat here again.",

When was the last time you ate at a higher end steak house (not Outback folks) that included soup or salad and choice of potato? Enough said! If you're like me, then you've dined at many of the Vegas steak houses: N9NE, Strip House, Morton's, Delmonico's, etc. One thing is consistent among all of them - sides are sold ala carte. Not at The Steak House. Here, your $60 dollar steak includes choice of black bean soup (french onion for an extra charge) or salad and choice of potato.   The black bean soup was accompanied by sherry wine and red onions. The explosion of flavors after adding the sherry and onions was fabulous! Their black bean soup definitely gives Georges \"famous black bean soup\" in La Jolla, CA a run for its money. I ordered the 12 oz filet butterflied. I regretted not ordering the 9 oz after eating one too many bites of the black bean soup. That said, the filet was delicious. I also got to taste the bone in ribeye. My oh my was that fantastic!   The service was wonderful. They wait on you hand & foot and your glass will never be empty. The best part - the food comes out fast.   Why only 4 stars? My garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely divine, however, they were served cold. I like my food piping hot. Not a problem, they quickly resolved the problem. Also, the restaurant was way too dark, making it difficult to read the menu let alone try to eat your food. It could also stand to be updated, but, then again, it is in Circus Circus.  Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience. I will definitely return, and I highly recommend it.  Bravo The Steak house! Well done.",

He was on top of everything; refilling drinks, asking how things tasted, if we needed anything else, etc. 5stars. I had the salmon fillet with the sweet chili glaze on the side. Very very good!! 5stars.  My boyfriend had the bone in cut Prime Rib. Perfectly cooked to his likings just like he ordered. He enjoyed it so much!! 5stars. I do have to say, the garlic mashed potatoes are to DIE for. So good!! It was my boyfriends birthday and Mitch surprised him with a piece of chocolate cake. I would come here all the time if I had a bunch of money at all times. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or date night out.  Thank you for an amazing experience and amazing food!!!",

The menu is small and to the point which makes ordering very easy. Not much selection on the sides that come with the meal, but I came for the steaks and they are very good. The flavor is in the meat itself and you don't need a ton of seasoning when the meat is good. Our waiter Mitch was on point.   I'm knocking 1 star since you do have to go inside the horrible casino to get to it and I wish they would up the dress code. I don't like going to a steak house and seeing people in shorts and sandals.",

Dark wood, large comfortable booths, and Frank Sinatra music playing. The dinners come with soup or salad, choice of potato and a vegetable. As good as the food is, the wait staff is just as good. They are not just waiters and bus boys. It's their profession and they obviously take pride in what they do. I had to send my filet back because it was q bit over cooked and our waiter, Ray, whisked it away and was back in minutes with a brilliantly medium rare ( more rare than medium) filet, another whole baked potato and carrots. Besides a delicious chocolate raspberry birthday cake for our friend's birthday, he brought me 3 large chocolate covered strawberries just because I sent back my dinner. Total bill with tax and tip was $204. That included drinks. The check would have been double that at Mastros. I'll gladly close my eyes, hold my nose and run through that shit show known as Circus Circus to go back again.",

Everyone's meal was cooked to order and delicious (tough to do with some pretty picky eaters in the bunch, including a former steakhouse chef!)  Attentive service from start to finish and didn't break the bank on the bill.  Very reasonable for dining on the strip with that 'old-school vegas' feel.  Definitely recommend!",

He said it was a best kept secret, and he was right. easy to overlook, but near our elevator we walked in 40 minutes before we wanted to eat and made a reservation - on a saturday night - we probably could have walked in without a problem. The menu is fairly simple, but it has everything a good steak house should have. they even show you the room they age the meat in. dimly lit, comfortable table, great cow paintings- even the butter was stamped into cow shapes. amazing bread, prime rib petit portion was enormous...really good!~",

I have been reluctant to dine here mainly because of its location but I regret not dining here sooner.  The waiting staff is attentive, classy, and very professional.  We ordered the French onion soup and the jumbo shrimp on ice.  The jumbo shrimp was very good and the French onion soup was a little thin but flavorful.  For the main dish we ordered the filet mignon and lobster.  The lobster was probably the best lobster we have had in Las Vegas.  The filet was very good however it didn't tremendously stand out over other steak houses we have been to.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the wait time for our initial and subsequent drinks orders seemed to take way too long.  Overall, it was a breath of fresh air after dining at other high-end dining establishments on The Strip and being consistently disappointed over the years.  We will definitely be going back!",

Once, I called about 3:30 in the afternoon and it was...no, it was 10:30!!! This place can be that busy on weekends. I do recommend reservations whe npossible.   Well, we went during the week last week when a friend was in town and we actually we able get get a quick seating. The interior; it is classic Steakhouse and has nothing of the gloriously cheesy circus atmosphere that exists just outside the doors.  I love how it looks-oh, and the cow paintings as you enter the restaurant on either side of the hall are great!! The service;our waiter was great.  no problems there. The steak; I shared a porterhouse medium rare and my friend had the strip.  I gotta say, I have been here before and the steaks were good.  Today, it was cooked as i ordered, but was just ok.  I choose the place and was too embarrassed by my steak that I didn't ask my friend how is strip was.   Would I go back? yes, eventually.  But only after i hit the Golden Steer nearby a few times-I rarely had a mediocre steak there!",

Dark, leather booths, and grill in middle of restaurant. Even has a room as you walk in where you can see the beef being aged.  Unfortunately they don't use salt and pepper. I noticed everyone at our table saying they could use extra seasoning, so I decided to go watch them cook. I was right. No salt, pepper, or any other seasoning. Watched about $500 worth of steaks come out of the drawer, out of the plastic, and onto the grill. That's it, straight to the plate. Would be four or five if they wouldn't ruin good steaks. everything else was nice, sides were especially good. Not worth $50 a steak.",

Walking in, it was amazing because of the open fire area where the chef cooks the steak.    After receiving a great variety bread assortment, we had the black bean soup as the first course and that was great.  My husband and I each ordered a surf and turf of steak and crab legs, and we definitely could have shared one order of the 'surf'.  I think we were each given about four king crab legs, split and presented very nicely with each meal (the crab legs came out on a plate of their own).  After ordering a bottle of wine and two main dishes with the seafood added, we were pretty high in the price, but it was a great meal with fantastic service.    Another place we really enjoyed while we were there was Texas de Brazil in Town Square - a great five star restaurant!",

In the center ring, you can see the chefs prepare your meal through a kitchen enclosed in glass.  The food is delicious and the portions performing plentifully.  The king crab legs were plump and expertly cut in half.  The house salad has a superb variety, with carrots carefully cross-cut for visual appeal.  The bread basket includes performances by a variety of breads, including pretzel dough.  The main performance, the filet mignon, was tasty and flavorful.  Even our cocktails--stoli on the rocks--were tremendous (the glass was filled almost to the brim--a triple instead of a single shot).  My one complaint is that the server did not properly serve the wine, which is odd in a restaurant of this caliber.  Perhaps the server underestimated a group of guys in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties in t-shirts and flip flops (the sign at the front assures guests that \"resort casual\" is OK) and thought we were young tourists not familiar with the wine service ritual.  It's fun to be an undercover foodie sometimes.  In any event, I did miss this part of the performance and this was the only bit of clowning around the whole meal.  This place deserves the spotlight.  After a standing ovation, I'm ready for an encore on my next trip back.",

As described by others this place has that old time social club feel with the dark greens and reds set against the dark wood paneling. They have a simple menu with your choice of beef (rib eye, porterhouse, sirloin, etc.) Lamb, chicken or fish. Side dishes? what side dishes, I guess they don't believe in them other than sauteed mushrooms but that didn't distract me from my porterhouse with baked potato that came with a huge side of bacon! Everything was flavorful and the mesquite char was nice. Not as expensive as other high end steak places probably because of the lack of expensive sides and stuff but that wont stop me from recommending this place to others.",

My girlfriend Jacinda and I went here on my birthday this past Monday, Mar. 7 and I must say that this place truly impressed us both. Honestly, from the bread, to our steaks, to our incredibly attentive and friendly waiter Mitch, it was high class through and through. We had ordered a French onion soup in addition to my petite filet mignon and my girlfriend's NY strip and everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The soup even came with an accompaniment of shredded cheese along with green onions and delicious garlic croutons. And speaking of that soup, our server had forgot to serve it to us after our salad and our steaks had arrived without any sign of the soup. Mitch was quick to apologize on the server's behalf and insisted to comp the soup and serve it to us along with our steaks. Of course, having a soup with the steak is a perfect combination and so I didn't mind enjoying this dish with our main meals. The m'aitre d also knew it was my birthday and so he also comped our deserts. I had the apple torte and Jacinda had a chocolate mouse pie. Both were a fine ending to a very classy and memorable 30th birthday! Only small knock would be the abbreviated wine list. While it is more than enough with some decent choices, I assume there are quite a few steakhouses around Vegas with much larger selections. I am no wine snob, but I do know that Gallo wines is quite basic and it was one of the reds on the wine list. However, the Clou Du Bois we enjoyed with our steaks was perfect, but don't go there expecting to be exposed to anything special.",

Our waiter came by with the dessert tray and showed us the desserts and kept walking with the tray.  He never asked us if we wanted to order one, and quickly returned with our check.  I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in Vegas and this was very bad.  Just to list some others that I have been to....Gordan Ramsey Steak, Hugo's Cellar, Maestros, Cut, Stripsteak.   Any of these I listed blow this one out of the water.  I am not sure if the people reviewing this are not fine dining experienced, but their reviews are very deceiving!!

It is no wonder they were awarded the best steak house in Vegas so many times. The sides were great I even finished off my girlfriend's sides and the service was excellent. Our waiter made us feel right at home, he was very friendly and funny. On a side note, I would suggest you make reservations at least a day in advance. I had to wait a day to eat there because they were fully booked.",

    "text": "If you love old Vegas the way I do, you will really appreciate a fine-dining restaurant that is located within the 2nd dingiest casino on the strip (after the Riviera) and won best steak in town for like 40 years or something ridiculous.  Arriving for our reservation, valet was kinda backed up, so my husband dropped me off while he went to park in the garage. The maitre'd greeted me promptly, seated me, and asked my husband's name so he could seat him when he arrived. On the way to our table, I was shown the meat room, which has all types of beef, including halves of cows, hanging up and aging. Cool. Service was friendly and efficient, from the bread basket to a bottle of champagne, to our meals, to the dessert cart. We had the petite filet and the ribeye and both steaks were excellent - seared on the outside and pink to red inside. The sides were good, and we really enjoyed the seafood platter appetizer.   Even better than the 'classic-ness' of the Steak House is the value. We ate steaks with salads and sides (no a la carte here), a seafood appetizer, bottle of Moet, and cheesecake for $240 with tip.  I'm torn on 4 vs 5 stars because of the Circus Circus locale. That place is old and pretty gross, but in a way, that makes me want to give the restaurant its extra star. It remains at 4 for now, until I make an equally excellent return visit.  I recommend that every local visit The Steak House at least once and would also endorse it for tourists yearning for a little of that old style steakhouse feel.",

Salad was spectacular, fresh and crisp and perfectly dressed with house dressing. Hubby had blue cheese and loved it too. Extremely tender steak. I ordered medium and it was a touch red but that is my only complaint. Entrees came with salad AND choice of potato or rice AND veg AND three steak sauces. No ala carte side to \"cha ching\" the bill. How novel is that? Don't like steaks, pork chops and fish choices are also on the menu. Definitely recommend.",

I've been to Morton's, Fleming's,  Mastros and Patrellis,  and some Chicago Steakhouses.  It was a good piece of meat but that was it; didnt seperate itself from the pack.

    "text": "OMG!!!I believe We as a people advance 10steps forward and 30 steps back. I was born in Las Vegas, NV. I can remember when you could walk from one end of the strip to the Tropicana in no time. I can remember my parents going to Cesar's palace to be entertained by Diana Ross. At the age of 3 my mom married my stepdad and He relocated us to Los Angeles,CA. They have transitioned. In October of 1968 my mom brought me to Circus Circus for their grand opening. I'm a professional. With my profession being law enforcement. I'm considered upper middle class. I'm a frequent flier and avid traveler. I visit Vegas yearly alone or with family and friends. But in October I come to Vegas alone to celebrate my birthday. It's sentimental for me. I come alone and think about all the beautiful memories I have of Las Vegas as a child.  CIrcus Circus isn't really my cup of tea. However I stay here because of the memories. So my vacation started with 2-nights stay in Sedona ,AZ and then Las Vegas. Another tradition in our family is to go out to dinner for lobster. My parents didn't care what it cost we ate lobster for dinner.  I've seen THE STEAK HOUSE several times but elected to eat at Palms or other restautants but on the 27th I decided to try it out??! Big mistake. I'm sure the staff are Donald Trump supporters. I have never in my life experienced the racism that I experienced in my life.  The waiter was so confused because I ordered the most expensive lobster platter on the menu. He couldn't answer simple questions I asked him. Mind you he was Asian and had the nerve to be racist...??African American people stay away from this place. The greeter wasn't any better. This place isn't all that trust me! Your just a cut above the Red Lobster. By the way I refuse to eat their also. I divorce them when they changed from the seafood broiler. I will never come here again. As a matter of fact I will never come back to Circus Circus again. The Steak House I just want to thank you for ruling my family tradition. Do not eat here if your AFRICAN AMERICAN",

But after many years and many many recommendations I finally made the schlep over and now I am kicking myself for eating anywhere else in vegas for a steak.   First off you can see how they cook the steaks when you walk in and they are char cooked so if you don't realize that your an idiot and are wrong sorry.  Next the hospitality was bar none might have been the greatest experience in a restaurant in my life. Our waiter was amazing! I was going to order a caprese salad and he told me dont worry about it cause you get a salad with your steak I was still going to do it cause I wanted mozzerella and he brought some out for free without asking so I could have my meal the way i wanted it.  For app we had the shrimp cocktail. Beautifully plated baby arm sized shrimp and he knew we were sharing so he brought them out on seperate plates already for us with our own lemons and cocktail sauce.   Afterwards he came back and chatted with us about NY and the history of the restaurant among other things. Extremely knowledgeable and all around great guy.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly and he even went and found me some fresh ground horseradish for my steak to top it with. I can't wait to get to vegas to come back here worth a trip by itself and this time I am definitely getting the prime rib!  side note first time I ever tipped 30-40% in my life",

    "text": "I came without a reservation.  I'd recommend making reservations beforehand as the restaurant was pretty much booked.  I was able to sneak in around 7 pm with a 15 minute wait.  Service was very attentive.  They serve bottled Arrowhead water as your drinking water.  I ordered the Oysters on the Half-shell, Rib-eye steak, and had my soup that came with the steak upgraded to the French Onion Soup.  Oysters on the Half-Shell - Terrible.  The presentation was fine, and oysters were separated from the shell and cleaned well.  I tasted no grit, but they were very bitter.  I'm not an oyster connoisseur, but I've never had bitter oysters before and I certainly didn't enjoy them.  French Onion Soup - Tasty.  The cheese stayed melted throughout the entire time I was eating the soup which surprised me because a lot of the times, the cheese just congeals.  I enjoyed the soup thoroughly.  It wasn't too salty and was full-flavored.  I would probably get this again if I had to come back.  Rib-eye Steak - This was way under-seasoned and there was a lot of char on the steak to the point where all I tasted was burnt crust in some of the bites.  The parts that weren't burnt, I had to add a lot of salt for some flavor.  I find it really sad that a steakhouse charging these prices cannot cook a proper steak.  I was incredibly disappointed because I wasn't able to go here the last time I was in Vegas and made it a point to make an outside trip to come here this time around.  I was sorry I did.  The sides weren't too bad.  I had the garlic mashed potatoes, which were actually pretty good and the best thing on the entree plate.  The veggies were nothing to write home about.  Service is very helpful and attentive, but food-wise, this failed miserably.  Overall, I would not come back, and if anyone in my group suggested it, I'd probably nix the idea right away.",

    "text": "Note: Restaurant Week August 2013  Brad \"Mr. International\" T. & I decided to come here because this was something he has always wanted to try. Also, we needed some red meat after not eating any red meat for 3 months! I was hungry for some good steak!   Courses.   First course: Caesar Salad - (2.5) It tasted like any other caesar salad and it wasn't something that I was impressed by, I could have made a better caesar salad.   Second Course: Filet Oscar -  Mesquite Grilled Petite Filet Mignon Topped With Alaskan King Crab Meat, Asparagus And Hollandaise Sauce.  With a side of loaded baked potato  (3.8) I was super excited to try it and have some good steak! I ordered my filet medium rare & maybe I should have asked for it to be rare instead. It was a bit overcooked, but it still tasted great!  However, I wasn't a big fan of the hollandaise sauce. :( It was way to creamy for me or maybe I just dont like hollandaise sauce at all.  The carb meat tasted delicious. I loved it so much! The loaded baked potato was simple and ordinary.  They  put all the sour cream, butter, bacon, and chives on another plate.  Which was pretty cool because you determine how much you want on your baked potato.    Dessert: There was a variety of desserts that you can choose from. Yay! From the choices I remembered there were creme brulee, another type of creme brulee, banana foster in a martini glass, chocolate cake with raspberry, and a few others. Brad T. got the banana foster and I got the chocolate cake with fresh raspberry!  Banana Foster in a martini glass (5)  It tasted amazing, THE BEST banana foster crepe-like I had ever had.  It was perfection!  My chocolate cake with fresh raspberries (4): It was very moist and I loved the raspberries.  Service (5): They were amazing and always filling your drinks, checking up on you,and professional!    Atmosphere (4): very old-school vegas, with the red leather seats/booths, but I really liked it. They had deer heads mounted on the walls, but good thing there wasn't too many of them, then that would be over-kill.  I remember counting only 2, but then I realized there was another section of the restaurant.    Great place, great service, and great food!",

This restaurant was zagat rated for several years and I highly recommend this place if your desire is for an outstanding steak.  The only drawback is if you want call it, it's in Circus Circus... Not to sound like a snob, but there are far nicer hotel casinos in the area that have restaurants that you would think serve the same caliber of steak..

    "text": "I was in Vegas about a year ago and did some research into which steakhouse to patronize. I chose one that was well reviewed and that had made more than a few top ten lists. It had a famous guy's name attached and held a prominent position in the ranks of the city's swanky meat joints. I could not have been more disappointed and upon leaving the place, felt a little swindled.       This time I decided to go old school-y, narrowing it down to The Steakhouse, Hugo's or Golden Steer. I was more than happy with my choice of The Steakhouse at Circus Circus.       The worst part of the visit was the actual walk through CC. it's not nearly the worst place I've ever walked through, but it's a bit of a dump. The ceiling felt a little lower and the cig smoke smelled a little thicker than the Vegas average. I breathed through my mouth and moved quickly.        Once in the restaurant, you walk past an glass enclosed aging \"closet\" and a glass enclosed kitchen where you can see them grilling the most gorgeous slabs of beef and pristine shellfish, all on the way to really beautiful red leather booths and white tablecloths. The lighting is low, the room warm and dark and in the background you hear the hum of Sinatra or Tony Bennett. It's all like some welcoming Martin Scorsese cliche  is playing out just for you and it's awesome. Fantastic vibe in this room!          You get bottled water and a less than stellar bread basket after ordering. The pre-meal  salad was decent with generous amounts of crumbled bleu cheese. My companion thought the black bean soup was on the bland side, but liked the addition of sherry and onions on the side.         I had a bone-in ribeye that was around the size of a hubcap and my companion had a porterhouse that was a bit bigger than that. These things were huge. I didn't finish mine, which is rare. And speaking of that, both steaks were cooked a goddamned perfect medium rare with a nice criss-cross mesquite char covering tender and flavorful goodness inside. I had not had a steak this good in a very long time, in this city or any other. I added sauteed mushrooms and peppercorn sauce on the side, but they were unnecessary. The other sides were fine. Garlic potatoes, wild rice, asparagus, yadda yadda....The meat is the show here, and worth the trip.       Skip your Kobe wagyu fancy-Dan, trendy-Wendy steakhouse and come here. It will make your soul happy and you wallet happier.",

    "text": "(Dined 2-14-2013, thought I already posted)  My husband and I just finished our \"Valentines Day\" dinner tonight,  Saturday evening. He was very excited about the surprise dinner he planned stating they had great reviews and is always listed as a top Steakhouse. Neither of us had dined here before.   We arrived to The Steakhouse after walking through The Circus Circus to find a surprising setting and ambiance. We were greeted by the manager and immediately walked to our booth after giving our reservation info. The manager actually turned the table sideways so I could slide in and moved it back after we sat! Being 6 months pregnant I found it unexpected and greatly appreciated.   The menu was old school, straight forward and genuine. We both ordered the bone-in prime rib. It was a Flintstones sized cut! Delicious. For dessert we got 2 orders of the chocolate covered strawberries because the first was so sweet.  But, the kicker, the icing on the cake, what really made the entire evening special, unique and tailored to us was Javier's top notch attention and service!! He was friendly, pleasant and engaging. He spoke to us about our soon to be baby girl being that it was our first child and told us about his family and related. He was absolutely amazing and definitely made the evening memorable. My husband and I enjoyed our first Valentines as a married couple because of the experience at The Steakhouse!",

Don't be fooled by the worm down circus circus hotel and casino which is not a cool place to stay unless you want to see a bunch of kids running around and screaming but the steak house is a remnant from the past when the casino was much nicer. The wait staff was on point and the shrimp was great ..steaks were also very good .. We had a half shrimp app (2 shrimps ) , 2 steaks (rib eye on the bone ) oh and a salad app to share with the shrimp..had one drink the bill was $200 with the tip..so yes it's  dry expensive compared to many places but it's worth seeing a piece of old Las Vegas ..",

    "text": "Ate here while staying at the Circus Circus hotel.  Mitch, our waiter, was both very knowledgable and helpful.  The food was on par with a restaurant of this stature, but I will admit I've had nearly as good of a prime rib at other less expensive restaurants like Texas Roadhouse.  The real value in this place is the fact that it isn't ala carte like so many restaurants in this category.  My bake potato came with a heaping side of bacon, butter, sour cream, and chives which was plenty more than I needed.  My only real gripe is that their appetizers were seafood only which I did not care for.  If you are staying at the circus circus there is a coupon for a free bottle of wine at this restaurant, but keep in mind the bottle they give you with this coupon retails for $5.39 at a wine store, but hey it's free.  Overall a nice steak restaurant worth going to on the strip if you have never been.",

It is noted for serving dry aged beef from an in-house cooler located near the entrance to the dining room.  After reviewing the wine list and estimating our final bill, I selected a bottle of Rosemont Estate Shiraz. This $32 bottle of wine, featuring a twist off top, retails for approximately $8, but proved to be an upgrade from what we have been .  We started off with a grilled shrimp appetizer that included a delicious garlic butter sauce. Dinners include a basket of bread and house salads.  The bread was warm and the salads fresh and flavorful.  We each chose the petite filet mignon that was perfectly cooked to medium rare as requested and accompanied by an impressive amount of garlic mashed potatoes plus several baby carrots. We doggie bagged a single slice of chocolate mousse cake.   Our food was excellent and the service throughout the evening was seamless. The final bill came in just $3 short of our $150 comp.",

    "text": "Wow... where to begin.  The seafood sampler appetizer was truly horrible.   I have no idea what breed of oysters they use but what little flavor they had was odd... not off, just odd.  Don't let them tell you there are 4 crab legs... there are 2 single sections cut in half (for 4 pieces) and they are old and meal-y.  The shrimp were large but also pretty flavorles and obviously not Black Tigers.  I will say on the plus side, their house made blue cheese dressing was passable and the lettuce wedge was crisp and freshly cut.  The negative comments regarding unseasoned meat are correct, but I prefer that personally.  Proper aging gives all the flavor you would need but sadly (regardless of the aging room prominently displayed as you walk in), this meat is barely aged.  I would suggest they clean their grills, though, as the char marks had a bad flavor to them that detracted from the overall flavor instead of enhancing it.  Service was good (the only reason they got 2 stars instead if 1) although no one inquired as to why we allowed the seafood to be cleared having barely been touched.  At $61 and the highest priced single item on the menu I would have thought there would have been at least a little curiosity... unless they know in advance that it is sub-par and just count on the lack of sophistication of most guests to get them by, of course.  I don't care what kind of awards they've won, this is a place to avoid.   If you want a GOOD traditional steakhouse experience in Las Vegas go to the Golden Steer.",

Everything was salty. The fish was not cooked correctly. The sauted mushrooms tasted weird. Canned perhaps? The asparagus was OK, but simply cooked. Microwaved?  So again, red meat eater's only.",

Our waitress and bartender were so friendly and funny and the environment was very relaxing. Sitting at the bar allowed us to make friends with other people and just had a blast.   I haven't even gotten to the food. It was AMAZING!!! I had a Bloody Mary, extra spicy. So delicious!  They brought us out a basket of different breads and the cutest slabs of butter with little bull shapes on top.  We all ordered the same thing.  Ribeye on the bone.  Seriously one of the best steaks I've experienced. It was huge and flavorful.  I love that A1 sauce was not even offered because it's all about the meat.  It was accompanied by Asparagus and a huge baked potato.  I was only able to eat half of my steak, my salad and the veggie.  I took the other half home with my entire baked potato and had that for breakfast the next morning.  Definitely a place I'll go to again and in my opinion was worth every penny spent.",

    "text": "You'd never expect to find this kind of restaurant in Circus Circus. We were invited by clients for dinner so had no say and went with a lot of hesitation.  Truth is, we were very surprised! It's an old school type steakhouse with the open kitchen and mahogany leather booths. Service was very good and welcoming.  Food was great,  too - both in price and quality.  All dishes come with an appetizer of soup or salad,  and a side of potatoes or rice.  Our table had the rib eye, salmon, and halibut.  The halibut was dry but everything else was good. Full bar also helped the experience!",

They got my order wrong, gave me a baked potato instead of mashed, they brought out the mashed potatoes without hesitation and promptly, they brought out a slice of cake (chocolate) and wished her a happy birthday.  I loved the experience and the feel of the restaurant. Romantic and old Las Vegas feel to it.",

    "text": "Being an unabashed carnivore who has a passion for the fascinating ,and sometimes sordid, history of Las Vegas, The Steakhouse at Circus Circus was a truly memorable experience that seems to have been tailor made for me!  (OK, I just flashed back to the Yelp! South Park episode where Kyle's dad goes into these long winded and terrifically verbose reviews. My bad.)  Anyways, back to this incredible experience!   Having to navigate through Circus Circus and the hordes of kids was pretty annoying, but once you step through that archway it almost feels like you are being transported to a different time. They definitely kick up the a/c in there and you could feel it instantly!  The room is a throwback to classic, old school Vegas. I LOVE IT! Lots of dark oaks, dim lighting, and romantic music are some of the first things that hit my senses. The other thing....  ...the incredible aroma of steak being perfectly cooked and marinated! Wow! It smelled so good in there!   Nancy was our server this evening and she was outstanding! Very friendly and attentive service, without being at all intrusive. When we return(which is about a 100% guarantee at this point), we will certainly request her!   We were seated promptly and within 2 minutes were brought a bread bowl with butter and served our drinks. Service was done in a very timely fashion very little lull between items. The bread was warm and soft, so the butter just melted perfectly inside. I didn't want to fill up on bread so I just had a couple of pieces.  As for the main course, we both opted for the New York Strip Steak ($56), which came with a choice of house salad or  black bean soup (I had the house salad) and garlic mashed potatoes or a baked potato.   The garlic mashed potatoes were so good! Compared to the puny and bland portion we recieved at another strip restaurant the previous week, this really hit the spot!  But the steak! Oh, that NY Strip steak was so delectable! It was so tender and juicy, the knife just fell to the plate with ease with each cut. We were both wildly impressed with how flavorful it was! Without a doubt, one of the best steaks i've ever had in my life!  Service was beyond outstanding! Our glasses were never empty the entire meal! It really made the difference between having a good meal and an experience!  Nancy asked if we would like to have desert, but we were totally stuffed and had to throw in the towel at that point! But, rest assured, we will be back! Oh, we will be back!  5 stars!  Woohoo! As good as it gets!",

Yes ... the walk to the steakhouse was lousy. loud kids running everywhere and it was pretty crowded when we went. But once we got to the restaurant all was peaceful inside.   We had a reservation for our date night so we were seated right away.   Everything we ordered from the salads to the main course was amazing. The food is so good. The waiter was very nice and the table side service for our salads was a nice touch.   We will definitely visit again .",

I've eaten at plenary of steakhouses and this one is average at best... let's progress thru the meal...  The drink... double Woodford Reserve on the rocks... a very generous pour and nothing but kiddos there..  The bread... they bring you out a variety basket of some truly different breads... problem is the bread was cold and so was the butter... sux eating medallion butters cold and not spreadable... one of these needs warmed up....  The salad... if I get a salad at a high end steak house I don't spect the salad to set the first impression bar high... this one failed on so many levels... first off they used standard packaged lettuce from a cheap dealer and half my salad was the hard white \"heart\" pieces of lettuce... the lattice cut carrots and cucumbers were a nice touch but the epic fail was the dressing.. the bleu cheese dressing was a bland almost ranch ... like they used hidden valley and sprinkled sub par finely chopped bleu cheese onto it....   The entree... bone in ribeye with steamed asparagus and a rice pilaf...kinda... the rice was well cooked and had decent flavor... the asparagus was nicely cooked with a little snap to it... the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare but lacked a great flavor... was just ok... it needed seasoned and for a 65 dollar steak it was a two cut steak(meaning two swipes of the knife to cut a bite off)... the steak in all aspects truly failed to believe... I have had better steaks at a longhorn steakhouse...   Not saying it was a bad place but with so many great steakhouses in one place I'd deff go somewhere else and spend a $150 on a great meal...",

My husband ordered a large steak, I ordered the garlic prawns and we made our own surf and turf by sharing.   Cheesecake was rich and delicious.

I must say that I'm not a big fan of Steaks because they are usually too dry for me.  I am definitely not a seafood eater, but both of these entrees sure got me to reevaluate my order in the future at a fancy restaurant.  The price, however, it shows three stars on Yelp, so it's no surprises that it will be a little heavy. However, I guarantee you that it will worth every buck. In addition, each order is enough for two.   Tips: The Onion Soup and the Galic Mash potatoes are also outstanding. Highly recommend that you make reservations,. especially during Holidays.

Our rib eye with bone cooked on charcoal tasted extremely good.    It's an open kitchen and we can see how they cook. The time control, seasoning, rest time they are all the same as you can find on YouTube. But how they aging the beef makes the different. Another key is the control of the charcoal fire.   We had the medium rare which was crispy outside (but not burnt) and juicy inside. The meat was so soft and tender which has nothing stay between teeth's. It's a almost perfect steak I would say.   Very good experience. Top choice if anyone staying at LV for one night. Everyone love steak should try.",

Was it the best steak I've ever had? No. Was the steak and service good? Yes. We were actually told the prices were cheaper than most strip steakhouses and sides were included. Part of this is True. Both meals came with a choice of salad and a side which was nice but we felt like the prices have increased significantly since previous posts. My wife had the chicken ($40) and I had the New York Strip ($64). Both prices are in line with modern steakhouses. If you want old school vegas feel and great service its worth a try. If you want a little better steak and modern try any of the newer casinos.",

It's \"old -Vegas\" style, it's dark, romantic,old-school & classy.  What a gem hidden in Circus Circus.  We happened upon it when a stranger at the airport happened to mention it- and I'm so glad we tried it.  We will be back every year in January when we're in town for The World of Concrete.",

    "text": "Throw back, old-school steak house where nothing much has changed in 40 years, including the bar tender or his vest. Once you get over the fact that you came to Circus Circus for dinner and step inside THE Steak House, you step into yesteryear and the Mecca of wood-fired steaks--seriously!   Our party of 10 was crammed tight into the tiny bar (seating capacity: 8) while our table was being prepared. The crusty old bar tender poured stingy, meticulously measured cocktails, squeezing every dime out of each liquor bottle while we were tantalized by the aroma of grilled steak creeping around the corner.   Not the best start to the evening, but fortunately, not an indicator of what would follow. After a short wait, we were led to the dining room via a narrow, dimly lit passage way that meandered by the dry aging room and then the meat tender who was man handling the nicest cuts of beef I've ever seen, slinging them around the wood-fired grill like nobody's business.   The service was super attentive and the kitchen is efficient. The steaks were as good or better than--and as generously portioned as any on the strip--or anywhere for that matter, including NYC.  The meat was as flavorful and flame crusted as your imagination allows. The clubby man-friendly atmosphere is somewhat reminiscent of the original Mortons in Chicago or Sparks in NYC--Dark wood, dim lighting, burgundy colored upholstery. I used to think Hugo's Cellar in the 4 Queens downtown was the best old-school steak house example remaining in Vegas, but The Steak House at Circus Circus has Hugo's Cellar beat by miles.   If you're too young to remember what great steakhouses used to be like (and should still be like) before they all became mechanized look-alike and feel-alike big chains (think Ruths Chris, Flemmings, Morton's, and Del Frisco's and more recent entrants like Eddie V's, Perry's, etc.) you must try The Steak House and compare. It's not as old as Taditch Grill (SF) or St. Elmo's (Indy) or even Keen's (NYC), but it is better, less costly and every bit as old-school.  THE Steakhouse is a destination unto itself even if you're not into the whole \"Circus Circus thing\". I took a cab from the Wynn and am glad I did. SW has nothing on THE Steakhouse!",

It was great as usual.  My GF, her daughter, and myself.  We ordered-  Huge shrimp cocktail. Oysters on the half shell. One Ribeye steak.  I'm going to say it was at least 24oz. Double Lobster Tails, easily 10oz to 12oz each. Split up the salads, choice of dressings. Two baked potatoes, and they threw in a third at no charge because that's the kind of place this is!    We could barely finish the steak and lobster we were so full.  Everything was outstanding.  They brought out a nice piece of chocolate cake for our Anniversary.   I had a lemon drop martini and the Queen of Reseda had a glass of Pinot Noir.    The bill came to $212.00 before tip.  What a deal for dinner for three!  Best value in Las Vegas.  The steak house at Circus Circus is the best.  Can't say enough good things about the place.",

    "text": "We came here to check it out.  I'm a Chauffuer on the strip and have done a couple of rides for people in a limo coming for dinner...  Curiosity got the better of me and I had to come try it out. I don't personally recommend a place unless it's either highly recommended, word of mouth or I have firstly tried it out myself....  Service was slow, there were no cocktail or desert menus.  We started with some fresh breadsticks and a variety of dinner rolls, some with raisins. The sweet raisin bread rolls seemed oddly out of place... perhaps a sundries tomato filling or garlic and herbs if anything would have been more palatable than raisin buns...     I don't want to order a cocktail and get slammed with a $40 charge for a drink that may or may not have ice flown in from some glacier somewhere.  Or a mystical $35 charge for a Creme Brulee that was harvested and helicoptered in from Mt Brulee....  I enjoyed my House Salad, nicely presented with Red Wine Vinaigrette. I would dare to say as a tip perhaps get the Vinaigrette on the side. It was a bit zesty for my liking.  My partner loves French Onion soup and tried the Surcharged French Onion soup instead of the house salad. He's comments on the soup that he did not finish was a pokey tongue raspberry sound....  Fresh cracked pepper was offered on the salads only...  My Steak was cooked well, as ordered, a good Medium cook. Seemed to lack some good flavor. Was just blah.  Broccolini was nicely steamed crisp to the bite, lightly seasoned.    Garlic Mash was essentially boring. Nothing special. Forgetful.  Drink refills were slow and the booth was pretty crammed for a party of 4.  My main issue with The Steak House at Circus Circus was the quality of meal for the money.  At around $100 a person there are at least 2 quick references I would recommend hands down over sending someone here.  I can not personally recommend this place.  Glad I tried it out for myself and that I would not wrongfully suggest this steakhouse to others....",

It was hard to get the burned taste out of your mouth. The worst part was the lack of seasoning. There was NO seasoning at all.  Baked potato could use some improvement. The bacon tasted stale like it was taken off the buffet the day before.  They offered a few toppings but cheese was definitely missing.  The only thing that saved the evening was the excellent service.  It was like we had two waiters and we were treated very well.  Oh, and also the bread saved the day.  That was some good bread.  The steakhouse would do better selling bread rather than steaks.  I don't see where all the other 4+ reviews come from.  There are better steaks out there.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC!! I stayed at the Circus Circus from 9/13 thru 9/16 of 2018. i did not know about The Steak House prior to my stay. FYI, this is a fine-dining restaurant. I ate dinner at The Steak House Friday and Saturday evenings 9/14 and 9/15 2018.  Entrance: There is short, well decorated and CLEAN hallway leading to the host/hostess station. I did not have a reservation and fortunately did not need one as I was dining solo and prefer to sit at the bar. The hostess was COURTEOUS, PROFESSIONAL and KNOWLEDGEABLE. The hostess sat me at the bar upon my request and provided a dinner menu and wine/cocktail list.   Bar: The bartender briefed me on the dinner and drink specials. I had a Maker's Mark with sprite and Stella draft. I'm mostly a beer guy, however i did notice Johnny Walker BLUE on the top shelf. FYI...it's $34 per shot which is a typical restaurant price. The manager passed by to greet me and make small talk.   Food: Appetizer: shrimp cocktail; I had the full order of 4 jumbo shrimp. Each shrimp was as big as my hand and i'm 6'0\" 230 lbs.  I ordered the porter house the first night and the 12 oz filet mignon the next night, both med-well, with loaded baked potato and caesar salad both nights. The beef here is PRIME RIB 21 DAY AGED. The bread service featured three styles of bread, two slim bread sticks, two different sized rolls. The B&B was warmed such that the butter was softened. Which is a nice touch overlooked by other establishments.  The steaks were cooked to PERFECTION, the salads and apps were great!  Service: The service is excellent! The staff are experienced, confident, and engaging.    Ambience: AROMA!  The aroma of the 21 day aged Prime Rib is absolutely mouth watering and INTOXICATING.  The steak House features an open grilling area in the dining room. the restaurant motif is that of early Vegas. And represents nevada's western and beef industry heritage.   Cost/Comparison: The prices are consistent with fine dining steakhouses and perhaps little more. I recently dined at Smith and Wollensky Boston, which is great! I would actually rank The Steak House a notch above.   Take-Home Message: Dine here!  You will love it!",

    "text": "My friend and I racked up enough points from playing all day and found out we could use them at the steak house located in circus circus. We were so excited because we heard good things and the smell that constantly lingered in your nose after walking by was amazing!  We entered the place to hopefully be seated right away. The mananger was standing at the hostess post and asked how he could help us. We went on to say we wanted a table for two. He then followed it up with \"well you need to make a reservation \". The place was not busy AT ALL but we agreed to it and made one. He told us the wait would be 45mins. Mind you, we walked in straight from gambling all day so we were not dressed up- far from it actually and we really didn't want to leave to change, so we sat down and waited. The manager kept looking at us as if he wanted us to change and about 15mins later he came up (after realizing we weren't going anywhere) to say he could seat us... this is when the horrible experience begins. We go around the corner to be seated and noticed only 2-3 tables were active. We sit down and giggled cuz we felt so out of place. The table arrangement was nice, as you can see in one of the photos. There were 2 waiters so we expected everything to run smoothly- we were wrong. Our waiter saw us and continued to service his other table. We sat for a good 30mins just waiting for drinks. I'm thinking this was done puposely to see if we would leave because of our appearance but we stayed cuz we wanted steak. We put our drink order in finally along with our order so we didn't have to wait longer. We got soup, another one of the pics, it looked better than it tasted. Totally not worth it to be honest. When our steaks came, the other pic, we got so excited cuz they looked phenomenal- far from it. We took a bite and looked at each other surprised cuz there was no...flavor...at all! And the potatoes were cold! We took a couple more bites and said screw it. Our waiter didn't check on us until another good 30mins and when he did we voiced our disappointment. He gave us attitude and got the manager. When he cane over we explained to him as well our disappointment and he was shocked that both of us had the same problem and proceeded to ask us to try another bite and we said we did (it was obvious) and then explained that we didn't want anything else. He then was trying to be nice after being kind of a jerk and offered another meal- we got crab legs and rice, they were OK, better than the steak for sure. Either way, this place IS NOT worth the money out of pocket and we will NEVER go back, even with points. The whole experience seemed stereotypical towards us because we were young, in our 30s, have tattoos, and were completely dressed down. They had no idea that we had money, which we did. It was like something out of the movie Selena... don't judge a book by its cover!! To this day I believe our experience and customer service (or extreme lack of) was the reason behind this. Sorry steak house,  but you were rude and horrible!",

It was great talking to the staff and hearing that they have been part of the circus circus hotel for 20-30yrs. The atmosphere is a very fun old school steakhouse feel.   The oysters weren't shuxked and had a lot of broken shell. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much by ordering seafood at a steakhouse. I thought well, this is a nicer establishment and they should have good quality stuff. Oops.   Anyways, my husband and I ordered both our meats rare as we are carnivores. Mine comes out perfect, his is cooked more medium. The waittress was amazing, she came back once we cut into our meat to check on us. She could easily tell that the meats were cooked differently and immediately offered to fix it. The replacement steak was cooked beautifully. Hats off to the waittress and chef to quickly make a happy customer.   Dessert and appetizers were wonderful, and added to the complete meal experience for our wedding anniversary.",

    "text": "We won a $150 dinner credit for the Steakhouse while attending a Travel Show back in March. We have to be honest, had we not won the credit, we would not have dined here.   Our reservations were made for us on the date and time that we specified through the Sales Department. Goofy as I can be sometimes, I remembered the date but not the time so I had to call the restaurant from our hotel room (yes, we stayed at Circus, Circus; check my separate review on that). The hostess answered, found my name right away and confirmed that we were due in at 6:30pm and was that time okay or did we need to make an adjustment? I told her that we would be there at 6:30.  We arrived on time and were immediately greeted and taken to a booth where menus and a wine list were presented. Our waiter's assistant came by with a bread basket and poured still water for us. He assured us that Felix, our waiter would be by shortly.  Felix arrived with a friendly smile and what I would call an abundance of old school charm. He took our drink orders. When he returned with the drinks, he asked if we had any questions or were ready to order.   I had two questions. The first was regarding the appetizer Seafood Sensation and what all was included on it. He said that it came with four oysters on the half shell, four prawns and four Alaskan King Crab legs. Okay, we can do that please.  My other question was whether their prime rib was salt encrusted or rosemary encrusted. For that question, he went and asked the chef to be sure. When he returned, he told me that it was salt encrusted rather than the rosemary which I preferred.  I went with the prime rib anyway. Rare. Bone-in. 32-ounces. House Salad with Blue Cheese. Baked Potato, loaded. It also came with Chef's Vegetables which was buttered asparagus. When my entree was served, the hunk of prime rib was so rare and so tall that heads turned either to admire it or in fear as it went by. It was absolutely fantastic! The Au Jus served with the beef wasn't the typical thin, over salted brown water served at so many restaurants but a thicker concoction with a depth of flavor that was simply wonderful.  She had the Rib Eye. Medium Rare, Bone-in. Not nearly as large as mine. The rest of her meal was the same as mine.   I asked Felix to slow down the timing of our meal. With such a large appetizer, we didn't want to get swamped with the salads and the entrees. He was kind enough to ask us when he took away the carnage that we created with the Seafood Sensation, how long we wanted to wait for the salads to be served. We were primed and ready to go and I asked him to bring them on!  The Seafood Sensation was very good. Everything was served sitting on a bed of ice and well chilled. The oysters were big and meaty as were the prawns. The King Crab legs were a bit misleading in that instead of four legs, we received four 1/2 legs. Each leg had been split down the middle on a band saw. A minor quibble, we had plenty to eat and it was all delicious! We each also  received a small plate with a 1/2-lemon wrapped accordingly to keep the lemon pits from falling onto our food. There was also a container of Cocktail Sauce as well as a container of Mayo/Creamed Horse Radish?. On the seafood display, there was another small container of Horse Radish.  For dessert, we split a Bananas Foster and each had a cup of coffee.    Between Felix and his assistant, we were very satisfied with the service. During dinner, she had Iced Tea while I had a Diet Soda. Anytime our drinks were down to about 1/3 full, they were replaced with a fresh drink.   Yes, we exceeded our $150 certificate budget by nearly $100 including tip and tax but I will always remember that beautifully hunk of loveliness that was presented to me.",

If you can ignore the fact that it's inside Circus Circus, then you will be visually stunned once you enter this really nice restaurant.   As you walk in, your nose is greeted by the best smell ever.... steak.   As your eyes adjust to the setting, you may be in disbelief that you are in a kiddie hotel.     The server brought our water, our drinks, and our bread and butter.... Now,  they had an incredible selection of warm tasty breads.   The water was fantastically fresh, that I had three refills.   My strawberry margarita was oh so good!!!   For the meal, I opted for the house salad with honey mustard dressing, as opposed to the black bean soup.   Great minds think alike, as my dad and my step mom each had the house salad, too, but with blue cheese dressing.  Delish!!!!   With that, my dad and I ordered the porterhouse steak with the garlic mashed potato option and with it was fresh steamed asparagus.  Our server brought over the A1 sauce, in individual sauce bowls for each of us....oh yeah, it was on then!!!!   My step mom ordered the lamb chops and she mentioned that it wasn't seasoned, but that it was good.   With her lamb chops, she also had green mint jelly in her individual sauce bowl, as well as mashed potatoes and asparagus.      Wouldn't you know it... I didn't save room for dessert.   But.  I did order the cheesecake to go, after heavy convincing from my dad.  Clearly, this food had to come home with me as I couldn't finish it all... I'm definitely coming back, as I told my husband who couldn't make it, that they also have grilled shrimp, mushrooms, crab legs, crab cakes, lobster tails, lamb chops, salmon and steaks on the menu.  I can see why everyone says this is theeeeeee best place for steaks.",

Something about the ambience.. just everything... the waiter we had was very attentive and came to check up on us very often, which was a plus in my opinion. In some places, the waiters ask if you need anything else and never come back until the check is needed. Not this place! I love how you can see the chef cooking your food right in the middle of the room. The food was absolutely delicious and prices were reasonable considering it is a steakhouse. We will definitely be returning here!!",

We received a tip from one of the bartenders and our Uber driver that this was the place to have a steak. I know what your thinking because I thought the same thing: \"seriously, Circus Circus?\" We decided to give it a try. I know it's not glamorous but, all I can say was the steak was great! We both order the rib eye.  A big plus is the salad and sides are included in the price of the steak. The rib eyes were cooked perfectly. Tender, juicy and huge! We definitely could've shared. If you decide to split, know that you will be charged $20 but this includes the salad and sides. The only downside is revamping the cocktail and wine list.",

    "text": "When I told my Uber driver that I planned to go to a Brazilian steakhouse while in Vegas, he suggested that I change my plans and go to THE Steak House inside Circus Circus.  I was incredulous that Circus Circus of all places could be the site of an unforgettable experience, but he went on and on raving about it, so I figured I had to check it out.  When the time came and I was on my way to THE Steak House, I told my new Uber driver where I was going, and he pretty much echoed the first Uber driver's sentiments.  I now felt even more comfortable that I was in for a fantastic dining experience!  THE Steak House definitely did not disappoint!  Upon entering, you are immediately exposed to the many restaurant awards posted just inside the entrance.  The rich, dark decor is reminiscent of old-time steakhouses and the grill and prep area right in the center of the restaurant allows guests to watch as the fantastic steaks are prepared.  I started with the Waldorf Wedge, which was delicious, with plentiful bacon and dressing; very crisp and fresh.  The fresh baked bread that accompanied the meal was literally so hot that it burned my fingers to hold it, and it had a delicious flavor, with very creamy butter.  I went with the New York Strip, and it was outstanding!  Tender, juicy, flavorful, definitely lived up to the hype!  I also had a baked potato, which came with numerous topping options, and was cooked perfectly.  Don't be fooled by the location...THE Steak House is transcendent and a must for steak lovers visiting Vegas.",

The inside of the restaurant is dark, but elegantly appointed with a classic steakhouse vibe.   I ordered a medium-rare prime rib, which comes with your choice of black bean soup or salad and your choice of starch (I went with the salad + mashed potatoes). Portions were generous so you won't be leaving hungry. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for steak.",

Upon entering, we noted the dry age room with all sorts of cuts of beef.  We then saw the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant -- a good sign.  This place doesn't have anything to hide!    The meal: we started with the complimentary bread basket.  All were fresh and warm.  I particularly liked the raisin bread.  Hubby chose the caesar salad and I elected to opt out of choosing a salad.  :)  (N.B. This place is not a la carte!  Sides are included.)  My salmon filet was perfectly cooked and my accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery.  Hubby's porterhouse was tender and VERY GOOD.  I almost wished I ordered that myself.  The only less-than-stellar component of our dinners was the veg (that night, carrots).  No flavour.  Dessert was the chocolate mousse cake.  It's the only dessert not housemade, but it was still decadent and delicious.  Coffee was meh, happy hour wine was yay.  Good value for a steakhouse on the Strip, as you're paying for the meat/seafood AND sides.  Great place for a cozy dinner, romantic date, or splurge.  Service was very good.",

The steaks are grilled on an open flames and charbroiled. They are cooked to perfection as well. The sides are your basic sides, nothing to rave about, they are still tasty. This steakhouse is a must! AND... Grab a matchbook on the way out! They matches are quality!  Come for happy hour before dinner 4-6! You can get a large glass of Grey Goose for $5.00.",

I was very disappointed in the Steaks...I ordered Filet Mignon well done and it was tough to chew so I order a Rib Eye and I was disappointed again. The service was great and the salad was delicious, but we did not come here for salad but for the steaks. My boyfriend Peter has been coming here for 15 years and for the first time he said his Rib eye was tough therefore he did not finish his steak which he normally does. Peter introduced me to The Steak House in 2010 and I have been coming with him ever since. I asked for the manager because I wanted him to know not because I wanted free food....anyhow I spoke to David and he wasnt very apologetic he looked at me like he didn't believe me. So what does he do...he gives me strawberries just to shut me up and doesn't return to the table at all. What an insult. I don't think I will be coming back for a long time.",

One you get inside however, it's like you stepped into a time machine and went back to a quiet steakhouse in the '70's.  It actually takes you a moment to adjust to going from a circus  (pun intended) to a serene, dimly lit dining room.     I loved the selection of breads, I think 4 or 5 different types, the pretzel bread was amazing!    Another thing I enjoyed is the steak isn't a la carte, you actually get sides along with your meal.  Now you won't find any duck fat fries or anything type of foie gras, nope, this is a traditional steakhouse!  I ordered the New York Strip.    The steak was good, could have used a bit more flavor,  I know a lot of folks do not like or think a good, properly aged steak needs to be seasoned however it can add to the flavor of great steaks and save ordinary steaks.   Still a very good steak, not sure if I will return with so many options out there,",

The food was cooked to perfection.  Needless to say, the food was delicious and everything else we ordered was fantastic including the wine selections.  Our wait staff and the folks that came by the table to see how we were doing was just as good as it should be at any place you go dine.  They were attentive, knowledgeable of their wine selections and they weren't trying to upsale anything which is rare in that industry.  If you want to experience what a great establishment should be like, this is the place to go.

    "text": "FAMOUS FOR: - Steaks  BUZZ - Prime Rib  I TRIED - French Onion Soup (7/10) - Bone In Rib Eye (2/10) - Sauteed Mushrooms (5/10)  I was once on a flight and saw that someone had left a Robb Report magazine in seat back pocket. I flipped through it and saw it had listed the 7 best steakhouses in Vegas, and I was astonished when it even mentioned Circus Circus. I mean, what is actually redeemable from that decrepit place? I read on to find out it actually won some kind of award saying it's the best steakhouse in all of Vegas. Wait... WHAT? Come again? Circus Circus...THE Circus Circus? The Circus Circus that's way off the strip, and has thousands of smelly kids (and adults) swarming and mobbing all over the lobby, the taxi lines, and hallways? THAT Circus Circus has the best steak? No F-ing Way! For a few years, I've been wanting to go, but probably in the 5 times I've been to Vegas since reading that article, nobody wanted to go. This time, I finally got the chance!  The menu is very simple. They have quite a few seafood options like crab legs, oysters, lobster tail, etc., but at a place called \"The Steakhouse,\" I feel like those are sort of obligatory menu items. No idea how they taste. Pretty much the menu is STEAK, and very few appetizer and side offerings. Asparagus? No. Creamed spinach or corn? Nope. Mac & Cheese? Psh! As if! They got seafood accompaniments and sauteed mushrooms. Period. So...pretty limited choices.  All the steaks I've had in Vegas have been decent, but not all that great. I'd prefer Morton's to SW, Carenvino, Delmonico, Cut, GR Steak, and I'm sure I'm missing a couple others. I was actually hoping Circus Circus wasn't good, because if it was good, that means we may need to make trips out this way to have steak from now on. Well..  FRENCH ONION SOUP Not my normal appetizer, but considering the limited choices, the only one that made sense. It was pretty decent. Presentation was kinda cool, bowl served on a plate with some extra croutons and cheese shreds in cute little heaps. Seasoned well, onions were cooked well. It was probably what I'd call textbook French Onion Soup. It was good, but nothing really made it unique or special. It was just good French Onion Soup.  RIBEYE Here goes. It's presented ok. The cost of the steak comes with your choice of potato. The steak looked healthy - decent spots of char all over. I start cutting a piece, and ended up finding that about 30% of my piece was fat. The fat is the most seasoned part of the steak, and also pretty delicious. Normally I cut it off, but hey, Vegas! It's the most seasoned part of the steak, so this bite should have been stellar...but...no. In fact, there was hardly any seasoning at all!  You couldn't even fathom my disappointment! If there was any kind of special mesquite flavoring, I didn't find it. The meat was decently tender, and I can't really complain about any of its technical aspects (i.e. medium rare was just as I asked), but the taste was just so BORING! Nothing inspiring, nothing savory, nothing...good! It was bad! I mean, there was nothing going on with this! It's not like \"no news is good news.\" With steak, \"no news is the worst possible news!\" I had to restrain myself from asking for A1, but I did end up sprinkling some salt on it. It did make it taste better but anytime you add salt after the fact, it doesn't taste right. I was so disappointed I probably left 1/3 of it. I was taking scoops of mashed potatoes with each steak bite, to try to add seasoning somehow. I tried everything. Nothing worked. It just gave up!  It was a pretty bad steak...not the worst I've ever had, but definitely the worst $50 steak I've ever had.   MUSHROOMS Well, certainly better than the steak, and while tasting halfway decent, it wasn't anything special. If I went to TGI Friday's or Outback or Chili's and got this batch of sauteed mushrooms, I'd have found it fitting, but if I paid $7 for them (and it was a pretty small batch), I'd like something with a little more creativity!   INDIANA JONES & THE STEAKHOUSE OF DOOM I was really, really upset! I mean, even though it was free (company paid), which should make it taste even better, I couldn't believe what a waste of money this place was. Considering the $20-$30 roundtrip cab ride and having to swim through a roaring (and smelly) sea of children and parents for about a mile (exaggerating), there's more at \"steak\" here (see what I did there?).   Either A) the reviewers were all full of sh*t, or B) We got the C- cooks, because I can't imagine how an establishment like this could have gotten high marks anywhere.   Thankfully, I now know, I don't EVER have to go to Circus Circus again! If you're a curious person like me, then you probably do need to go here, just to say that you've tried it and conquered it. Otherwise, if you're solely on a mission to try actually good food. Skip this place!",

Only the foodies and locals in the know, can look past the \"clientele\" that Circus Circus attracts in order to find one of the best Steakhouses in all of Nevada (yeah. I went there).   Service: Always top notch. These waiters are old school and professional. They know how to give you your space while at the same time remain attentive. Always kept our water full (with their own branded water! Free of charge, no need to pay for some fancy pants Euro piss).   Drinks: Solid. They know how to make a solid Martini and other various old school drinks. They didnt know how to make my wifes French Martini, but gladly comped us a free drink for having to ask whats in it (and they did make it right).   Food: I loved every portion and the food was presented nicely and on-time and perfectly paced.  Salad: The house made dressing and all the fixings were yummy.   Bread: Pretzel bread. Cow shaped butter. Enough said.   Steaks: I have had their ribeye. Cooked perfectly. Both amazing in cut and flavor. Is this some USDA Prime dry aged marbled beast? Not sure. But that wood grilled mesquite makes these steaks mighty darn tasty.  Dessert: Pretty solid. Basic usual suspects. Cheesecake, Ice Cream, Pie, Brownie.  Atmosphere: Classic steakhouse. Wood booths and green Leather. Pictures of Various Bulls, Cows, and Steers adorn the wall. Love it. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!",

The absolutely worst part of dinner was the a/c was not working properly. Yesterday it was 110 in Vegas.   It was so hot in the restaurant and the staff told us they were aware of the problem but there was nothing they could do.  This made the evening miserable - spent $500 on dinner for a family of 6 in a sweat box.  The waiter was the best part of the evening though - very friendly and funny.  Out of his hands regarding the a/c but completely unacceptable in a high end restaurant. Plus, one of the nice things about this place used to be the fact you entered through a closed door from the casino, then went through another set of glass doors to completely remove the fact  you were in a low-end casino.  When we arrived, all the doors were open so the experience was lost.  Not sure if they were attempting to cool the restaurant or the hostess was just trying to cool herself off.  Truly disappointing and won't even go back.  Should have gone to Morton's.  P.S.  Parking is a joke - valet was full.  We had 3 vehicles to park in their parking garages..that was an experience in itself.  I should have realized the evening was not going to end up well if you couldn't even valet park.",

The beef is aged 21 days but is a low quality meat....very chewy. I probably was only able to eat half my steak. There are many many better steakhouses on the strip that I have ate at. Service is mediocre. They do a great job keeping your water glad full but no plates were ever cleared until the next course arrived.  Menus were left on booth start until we left.",

    "text": "Inside Circus Circus  From being rewarded to their pretty good rating I'm led to believe that we descended upon this restaurant on a really really bad night. I'll explain why in a moment...  The first thing I'll highlight is how reminded you will be that you're in a steakhouse... from all the Cow Decor, to the smell of the cooking beef wafting through the air, to the kitchen being smack dab in the middle of the dining room, to the various cuts of beef being hung on display. Honestly not one bit of this impressed me, but I was still optimistic because of their reputation. The place looks very dated and although it may have been really classy at one point... it just hasn't been long enough to give off a classic or vintage vibe.  Other than maybe the deserts you'll see that the presentation is pretty consistent with most other steakhouses...absent if you know what I mean. I feel like one should be able to dine with their eyes as well... you know... involve all of one's senses.  We all started off by sharing their complimentary bread: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#hnwoRKQPYrn_Sk1XKgOo3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a> which wasn't bad and served as a pretty good precursor to our impending meal.  I then had a bowl of their famous Bean Soup: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#8udUmTWVy5eHpBH03i56Eg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a> I freaking love soup and this one was a very good example of a more rare soup that is available. I really enjoyed this and now really looked forward to my main entree in the form of...  Their Bone-In Ribeye: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#Y94ctMW52aSx_LHDxA2Z8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a> Now I'm fully aware they are more known for their Prime Rib, but not only am I not as big a fan of PR, but I just prefer the cut of a BIR and its wonderful marbling and flavor it normally possesses. I say normally because this place managed to deliver a steak that was devoid of flavor and just straight up tedious. I did appreciate the fact that my steak was cooked to my requested temperature of \"Medium-Rare.\" It had some pretty nice grill marks on the outside and was fairly tender. The sides of green beans and baked potato were \"ok\" at best... again nothing fancy. Normally I would never crave Steak Sauce at a Steakhouse or Chophouse, but found myself wishing I had brought some in an attempt to wake this poor excuse for a piece of meat up! They managed to kill this poor cow twice!  To finish off this meal I felt like I needed something with flavor to make up for what I just consumed so I ordered their Tiramisu: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-steakhouse-las-vegas-2?selected=h_saFHn_RCOk3QTUSLttpA#6DxGHudL6bhm0iwmePOzaQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a> which thank goodness was yet another spike up in the graph so to speak. This nice piece of Italian Cake was perfect in every way. it seriously had a nice balance of flavors, textures, colors, that were all rounded out to a beautiful presentation.  Service while kind was pretty forgettable. Our server did a really good job of conveying the fact that this was a job and any cordiality was more out of obligation.  There is plenty of parking at Circus Circus.  On this night we had received an experience that was totally reflective of the hotel it so comfortably sits in (also affectionately referred to as the \"Shits Carlton.)  I'm not ready to completely write this place off just yet... I just won't be rushing back with all of the great options in Lost Wages.",

    "text": "Life could be funny. One hour I am eating at the bottom of the restaurant totem pole in Sam's Club and a few hours later I am eating at the top of the restaurant totem pole in the Steak House (in Circus-Circus). Life could be unfunny. After 22 years I was seeing my estranged aunt for the first time and learning about one star circumstances that happened on my mother's side of the family. To put it nicely I was very relaxed before the meal and will probably be writing a review on Todd English P.U.B in the near future.    The Steak House is in Circus-Circus. This is an out of the way location if you are in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. If you are driving, the traffic could be heavy and the cab ride could be pricey. Owing to the fact that my Aunt was staying in the Aria, the Steak House was not my first choice. I would have gone for Ruth Chris's Steak House or someplace like Bubba Gump. However, my Aunt heard great things about the Steak House and really wanted to eat there. She did have a valid point. The Steak House claims in their web site to have been voted Best of Las Vegas for over 20 years and was named Zagat's 2011 Top Steak House in Las Vegas.   My first impression of The Steak House is that it is extraordinary fancy. It is the antithesis of Circus-Circus. The lighting was just right. The decor was extraordinary elegant. And up to the time that the waiter never gave back the change, the service was commendable.    My Aunt, brother, and I took advantage of the $31 Petite Filet Mignon special. Supposedly it is available throughout the month of June. The Petite Filet Mignon special started out with fresh baked bread. My taste buds greatly enjoyed it. I chose house salad with ranch dressing over black bean soup. My taste buds also greatly appreciated it. The Petite Filet Mignon special came with Chef's Fresh vegetables, which was a bowl of green stuff that I did not touch. From a choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato or wild rice blend; I chose the wild rice blend. My taste buds greatly appreciated the petite filet mignon at the same time that 1) they would have appreciated a bigger serving and 2) they experienced better steak at some other steak houses. The soda (or pop) tasted bland. The reality was that the dining environment added to the taste of the food. It was a dining environment ideal  for family members estranged after 22 years to catch up. As for the food, if I were to be given a blind taste test between their steak or Ruth Chris in a diner for example; I think it would be very close. I learned that in dining, a lot of the experience is the dining environment of the restaurant.   Life is funny. I learned that I enjoy casual dining food as much as elegant dining food.  In my opinion the dining environment in the Steak House might be better than steak in casual dining restaurants when the food is just the same.      The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 89.",

Nestled amongst the chaos inside Circus Circus is a diamond in the rough simply called \"The Steakhouse\". As I walked in it felt like I was walking into a steakhouse in Old Vegas....of course Old Vegas to me means something like going to Wet N Wild back in 1996. The dark ambiance was great, it felt like I was having a meal in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. The rib eye was simply ridiculous....it felt like I was cutting through butter. Magnificent!!! The flavor was awesome. The shrimp were the biggest I have ever seen and the baked potato was all that! Service was excellent.....our host Michael C. was simply the best, he was funny, witty, & a real Johnny On the Spot! It was so cool to sit there and watch all the steaks being cooked in the glass walk-in cooler as well. So, for now I have The Steakhouse in a dead heat for #1 steak in LV alongside  Mesa Grill.

First off, the bartender made us some fantastic old-fashions.  The service throughout the night was outstanding, and they seemed to be grateful that we chose to eat there.  It feels like what Vegas should feel like.  It is dark and cozy, and we sat in a red vinyl booth.  I love how you can see the aging room and the kitchen as you walk in.  The menu is simple, and we enjoyed the porterhouse, a mashed potato, the spinach salad, and the onion soup.  The breadbasket hit the spot.  Alongside the potato came a number of toppings, including so much delicious bacon it was comical!  The spinach salad was just okay, as we would have expected the dressing on it so you get that slightly wilted effect.  The rest of the meal was outstanding, and we especially enjoyed the steak.  It was cooked perfectly, and had a nice aged flavor.  We tried very hard to finish everything, but it was a battle that we eventually lost.  It is hard to even leave a bite at the table, but in Vegas there is no place for leftovers!",

There are a few places I really enjoy eating at where the location is less than attractive. If anyone's ever been to San Francisco and wants the absolute hands down best local Vietnamese food ever, Tu Lans is the place to be. The problem? Well its on 6th and Market which is probably one of the worst streets in San Francisco. Now back to The Steak House. Whats wrong with the location? Well... Its smack dab in the middle of the Circus Circus Hotel Casino. Not a place one would picture a steak house thats been voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" 18 years in a row. The minute I roll up to the Circus Circus, I immediately feel over dressed... Not that jeans, dress shoes, button down shirt would be over dressed anyone else in Vegas... After fighting off what seems like 1000 kids from the parking lot to restaurant, the whole atmosphere changes once you're in The Steak House. This place is like the other top notch steak houses. Classy. Definitely classy. We get seated and immediately feel like we're a million miles away from the Circus Circus. The waiter suggests the Rib Eye and who I am to argue with a professional. We also order the Prime Rib which could easily feed 3-4 asian girls. The meal starts with the standard fare, a variety of breads and a house salad (or the soup of the day). And at the exact moment that the aged meat arrives cooked to perfection, all our previous gripes about the location, getting here from the parking lot, and fighting off all the little kids seem to dissipate. Now I know why this place keeps getting voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" from the locals.",

    "text": "I strongly suspect that most Yelp reviews on The Steakhouse are not legitimate.  This is probably the worst steakhouse in Las Vegas and one of the worst steakhouses I have visited in a very long time.  First, the interior is drab and moldy and probably hasn't been updated since the Brat Pack were still active in Vegas.  (However, it's probably no more nasty than the rest of Circus Circus which you are forced to walk through to get to this place).  Second, the service is slow and, when they do show up at your table, often rude.  Third, the steaks are third rate at best.  If you are wondering what select grade meat tastes like go here.  Their ribeyes range from bland to so full of hard gristle that they are practically inedible.  I don't even want to get into their disgusting side dishes and salads. Finally, to top off this great experience you will pay top dollar for a steak that Outback would be too ashamed to serve.  Do yourself a favor and go to a real steakhouse like del Friscos, Ruth Chris, Delmonicos, etc.  It amazes me that this place is still in business.",

    "text": "Here's a question for you: where is the WORST steakhouse in Vegas?    Every damn steakhouse in this beautiful city claims to be \"the best in Las Vegas.\"  Yep, Pipefitters and Drain Uncloggers Union Local 133 proclaimed, and Retired Shop Teachers Society of Pahrump, NV agreed, that So-and-So Steakhouse is the \"Best in Las Vegas.\"  Think for yourself and know your sources.  Well, it was Friday night in Vegas and we found ourselves hungry and reservation-less.  All dressed up and nowhere to go, if you will.  I took the elevator to the main level and walked from the bright light of the casino to the pleasant darkness of The Steakhouse.  I basically talked the hostess into seating us at 7:45, which was less than an hour from that point.  The ambiance was that of a traditional steakhouse.  Quiet and dark, the restaurant looked like a classy, old-school, old-money parody of itself.  The Steakhouse has it all: dark leather booths, cow paintings, giant slabs of beef . . .  The prices here are pretty reasonable: $44 buys you a salad, a decent size steak with some vegetables and a potato side of your choosing.  Places like Morton's charge you about $50 for the steak itself, with the rest served a la carte.  However, comparing The Steakhouse to Morton's is like comparing the fence in your back yard to the Great Wall of China: both are made of bricks and both protect you from intruders, but only one is worth traveling thousands of miles to see it .  My New York strip from The Steakhouse tasted very bland.  While perfectly prepared, the meat simply lacked flavor.  It was a cheap USDA prime New York strip which could have been purchased at a local Safeway and cooked at home.  You can season the meat and charbroil it to death, but you just can't add flavor to it.  I guess you get what you pay for.  However, in the city of $7.99 prime rib dinners, The Steakhouse should really think about distancing itself from the competition.  A word about our waiter, if you don't mind.  Richard, who was pretty nice to the three of us in the beginning, was a bit confused about his target audience.  For the first few minutes, he was being extremely professional and helpful.  Shortly thereafter, he somehow mistook me and my two female dinner companions for 3 douchebags.  He went from \"Sir, will you be having wine this evening?\" to \"Dude, look at this steak!  Thick, juicy, full of fat - beautiful!\" and from \"Would you care for a shrimp cocktail?\" to \"Man, that stuff [horseradish] is HOT.  Owww!\" in less than 15 minutes.  We all looked at each other in disbelief.  There was a time when I could pass for a college freshman recovering from a tough fraternity pledge week, but not now.  I treat you with respect, and I expect you to do the same.  If I wanted to be your friend, I'd bring a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon and some pork rinds to your double-wide, OK?  Overall, an OK place for dinner if you find yourself on the North end of the Strip.  It's definitely NOT one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, but at least it's not outrageously pricey.  Meh.",

    "text": "Wow, like anyone and everyone should/would/could agree...who would think that such a great steakhouse would be in Circus Circus of all places.  Yes like sleepy t. wrote, don't let the location deceive you...this is definitely a 5 star steak house right up there with the top of all Prime steakhouses yet it is in Circus Circus.  This works to your adv. and disadv. Adv - It's kind've like that secret gold mine no one knows about, not full of really annoying people, and much easier to get reservations and better prices. DIsadv - Hard to convince a group to come there and/or tell people about the place without getting weird looks.    But if you've been to the circus circus steakhouse..you'll know straight up it's no joke. The 21 day aged PRIME steak is delicious, and priced very fair. In fact a bargain compared to places like SW steakhouse at the Wynn. When it comes to PRIME steak not many places differ, they all grill to perfection, and add salt and pepper. Really the only way they differ is...atmosphere, price, service, wine list, and sides.  The atmosphere at The Steakhouse is very comfortable, elegant and ritzy (unlike the family-oriented casino), the price is top-notch for a PRIME steak house (but of course not dirt cheap by any means), the service was great, and the sides...well they weren't the best i've had, but they had all the basics down to accompany a steak properly. ANd lastly the Wine List what of an appropriate size and price to accompany great PRIME steaks as well.   I am sad to hear that Circus Circus may be torn down in the future, I mean there needs to be some aspect of family left in Vegas. But mostly because the hidden jewel that is THE STEAKHOUSE at circus circus would go down with  it. In regards to overall value for what you get regarding Steakhouse in Vegas...you can't beat the Steakhouse at Circus Circus...otherwise you're just another goon..who believes the only way to get a good steak is paying $100 for a 12 ounce steak...and in that case you're not a real meat eater and do not deserve to eat PRIME. ~G",
