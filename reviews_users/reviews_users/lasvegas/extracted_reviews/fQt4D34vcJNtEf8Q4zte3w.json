    "text": "We enjoyed the overall experience here. We ate at TAO last July ('07) and found it all a new sort of dining experience.  We had a reservation but still had to wait an hour for a table, the waiting area was overcrowded but still comfortable. The bar staff were very good in fetching drinks while you waited.  The rather 'slutty' waitresses were a little off putting.  Even my husband (who enjoys a good eyeful) said that the whoreishness of the waiting area servers was obnoxious and way over the top.  We got a table right next to the big statue and the candle wall and that was really nice. Our server (luckily not one of the whoreish ones) was really nice and spent a little time talking to us and just being hospitable.  We LOVED the food. A wide range and many different things to try. I think there is something for everyone, if they like the 'out of the ordinary' Asian food.  This (of course) being Vegas and in the Venetian is going to have that little extra price tag, but it was exorbitant and we though it was worth paying a little more for the experience of TAO.  -1/2 a star for the stupid waiting time, -1/2 a star for the hooker waitresses.",

    "text": "Quite a scene here.  Consistent with other reviews, we weren't seated until an hour after our reservation time.  Which meant I dropped about $100 at the bar waiting.  As the night gets later, the crowd really pours in.  I couldn't wait to get to our table.  The amount of dudes standing around gawking at the women was ridiculous.  I don't know if the cheese dick bus stopped off but some of the people here were straight out of central casting for 'Night at the Roxbury'  Overall, my dining experience was good.  I thought the food was good considering its Vegas and everything here seems to be a knock off of an respectable restaurant elsewhere in the country.  The service was SLOW, but I can't blame our server, it was hectic in there.",

Service was friendly, attentive & majority of the waiters were quite decent looking lol.  *Lychee Martini - Excellent *Pork Spring Roll w/ Thai Chili sauce - delicioius, tho they're more like a triangle shape than a roll lol *Pad Thai - mediocre, wouldn't order it again *Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail Roll w/ Crushed Onion Rings - Flavorful, Fresh & unique *a Crusted Red Snapper dish - Awesome. the fish was cooked just right: not too dry, not too undercooked.& the sauce went well with it.   It's a fun, trendy atmosphere & I definitely want to go back...minus one star for the small portions...but ya gotta expect it in Vegas I guess.",

Spendy, trendy, and a little confusing menu wise if you have a big group like we did.  we had a great waiter that helped us with our order and nobody left disappointed or un-full.  The place is loud and full of energy and beautiful people.  Ask for help with the menu if theres a group.  If youre a couple youre golden.  So many things to try, you could eat here 100 times.

    "text": "Scrumptious! Loved Tao, we had an early reservation, 5 p.m. as we were going to see Phantom of the Opera, so I cannot verify the issues of other reviews who had to wait a long time even with a reservation.  We were promptly seated, and hats off to Titus our server. He was fabulous. When asking for recommendations he was honest and truthful offering an explanation as to why he felt the way he did about a dish. He was attentive, friendly and fun to interact with during our dining experience.  Now to the food, we started with the Lobster Wontons, steamed and not fried and exquisite. The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the ginger broth was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more. I ordered the Wok Seared New York strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. The sauce is bursting with strong Asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment. Tony ordered the Omakase, which is sushi and sashimi and is the Chef's choice. He was thrilled with everything served on the plate.   The food was wonderful,so  we decided to break with tradition and order dessert, that turned out to be a good decision. We ordered the Chocolate Eggrolls served with an Orange dipping sauce, again, truly amazing, there is nothing better than something with a crunch and oozing warm melted chocolate.   Can't wait to go back!",

My favorites out of everything our group of 4 ordered were the Pork Spring Rolls with Thai Chili Sauce, Unagi, and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice. I took off one star because you don't get good portions for the price and one of our dishes was just okay. The decor is very nice though. We were seated right beside the giant buddha over a pool of koi. Since we had dinner, we were given a stamp for free entry into the upstairs club which unfortunately wasn't as good as the restaurant.",

Ordered the Taotini which was excellent n the waitresses serving drinks are hotties!! Had the Chilean Sea Bass for main course which was superb! My wife is veg & ordered a few things off the menu but none of the veg items were good unfortunately. Go with the Chocolate Zen Parfait for dessert....it so rich n delicious! The waiter offered to get us in for free at the Tao nightclub n we didn't even have to wait in line. Totally worth it!",

The edamame appetizer was really really tasty. My friends had the miso-glazed chilean sea bass, lo mein, soy ginger salmon and a few sushi rolls. Overall, everyone was pretty happy with their dishes. I'm definitely satisfied with the portions...was happy to see they didn't serve bite-sized pieces on expansive white plates....the portions were large enough to fill.  The waiter was snooty, but he kept our water glasses filled. The restaurant is  also really loud. I sat at a table for 7, and I could barely hear the person talking one seat away from me.  I'd probably go back for dinner next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "We went to Tao Bistro when it was doing it Grand Opening... where my gf and I get to mingle with K-Fed, Robin Leetch, Lil Jon, Hugh Hefner and his ggggffffffssssss.... That night was the best night ever. For some reason Tao management decide to put us up to the Super VIP area and we enjoy great food and service. This review i would give Tao a 5 stars, because every was great and delicious especially the GIANTS FORTUNE COOKIE's DESERT.   We decide to give it any try this time around (May 10, 2008) I know it will be bad... But i give it the benefit of doubt that they will proof me wrong. The service was \"OK\" not bad or great. The food was however, horribly salty. i can't even finish 4 bites, even the desert is ok not great as i remember. so don't eat here unless you want to impress your date or desperately craving for chinese food.   Lounge: it's a good lounge and you should kick it here. I gave the lounge a 5stars.  Club: the only good thing about eating here is the fact that you get to cut in line when they open the club. However, its so crowded in here that you can't dance or walk. you get to see semi-nude dancer though. it's better if you come here with a VIP table so at least you get to sit when you get tire and the drink is within an arm reach.   Overall: if you never try Tao Bistro I recommend you try, since I'm asian my expectation of what chinese food should be is kinda high. For me their food is not that great, you should try the Grand Wok @ the MGM they are alot better.   Lounge: definitely need to go and kick with your buddy. there is a lot of girls that you can pick up and if you are a girl there is a lot of guyssss. If you want to still to your own gender, hey don't like me stop you....   Night Club: is fun, fun, fun and more fun.... especially Tao Beach is pretty cool partying up on the roofs.",

The food is so bad....... it makes it over priced.    We started off with veggie dumplings.  Let me just say, Trader Joe's makes better dumplings!  The we got an tuna wasabi appetizer.  The pieces were so big, we could barely fit them in our mouth!  We also got another roll that was cut into large pieces.  It comes down to this, I don't mind spend money on a good meal!  What a waste of money!  Don't go!!!!!!",

I have never been so cramped in all my life at a dinner.  That is a minus for this review.  After trying about 10 different appetizers at our table, I was probably hovering around a 3-star review.  The food was average for Asian food at best.  What do you expect, right?  It's an restaurant with food from all different Asian cuisines, probably not doing any of them real justice.  Then I got my entree which was miso seabass.  OMFG.  I eat lots and lots and lots of fish and seafood.  When I go out to eat, that's pretty much all I ever eat.  The fillet was over 1\" thick and cooked to absolute perfection.  It friggin' fell apart with hardly any pressure of the fork.  The miso was perfect.  Just a light coating which really enhanced the flavor of the fish itself instead of drowning or masking the taste of the fish.  So the hero of the plate?  The fish.  Ding ding!!!  We have a winner.  So many times I get fish and the hero of the plate is the sauce on top.  If you have a very fresh fish cooked properly the sauce should be mild and minimal.  I was jumping for joy.  Seriously, I've had miso cod and miso seabass and this has to be the best I've ever had.  Luckily for me before ordering the entree, I told everybody I wasn't interested in sharing.  I had enough beef and other types of meat in the appetizer round that I had no interest in anymore.  Nobody else wanted to order fish or real seafood, so I didn't try any of the other entrees.  I'm so glad - the fish was put on my plate from heaven.  Others at the table that were sharing their entrees were saying the pepper beef was really good, too.  I had no interest in trying it.  If I went back, there's no way I'd even try another entree because quite honestly, I doubt it will be anywhere nearly as good.  The appetizers were average - 3 stars.  However, the fish was a 5++++ star, so that averages out to 5 star.  I have a strong feeling that most of the entrees are not nearly as good.  I'll never find out because I'm not going to try them!  Based on what I saw others eating and their responses, they seemed to think the entrees were of similar level as the appetizers and were just decent.",

Our party of 10 stayed and roughed it out. When the food finally came it was cold and we were too tired to enjoy it. So they write a few Chinese words on the ceiling and throw in some asian looking statues. Ok looks like a Chinese restaurant now. Lol. To sum it up the food sucked and the service sucker. We went to the club and it was packed. They didn't count how many just let everyone in. I think the fire Marshalls came. Am I a complainer? No! This whole facility is poorly managed. Who is the GM and where were they 1.1.2015? Fire them asap. BTW. Who serves duck with Tortillas?? Its supposed to be with Steam buns. You don't see Asians in here which means it's an expensive version of PF Changs at most. You don't see Asians at Panda Express either.  Hint hint  I dont mind spending $1000.00 for food but it better be a decent experience.  So now they can take some of that money to put into marketing and lure in more suckers. Save your money and TIME because this place will take them both from you.",

I ordered the filet dish, however it was the most disgusting thing I have ever had. It was way too salty. They drowned the filet in black bean sauce. It was as if they had poured an entire jar of black bean sauce right over it. I wanted to finish my $80+ meal and plus I was hungry, but I could NOT get myself to swallow it was so salty. My friend ordered the kung pao chicken. She was gagging because it was so salty. We also ordered a side of chinese broccoli. How can you go wrong with gai lan?? Again it was drenched in oyster sauce. We hardly touched our food because it was so disgusting. I am not exaggerating when I say you can get better tasting food from Panda Express. Meanwhile we overheard one of the gentlemen sitting at the next table going on and on about how great his Kung Pao Chicken was. I guess we all have our opinions and he obviously does not have any tastebuds.  Don't go here. Food is disgustingly salty. Spend your money at the buffet instead. I noticed that Vegas steak houses tend to make their steak extremely salty as well. Maybe it's a Vegas thing?",

I've also dined at the New York location but prefer this venue at the Venetian.  I book via OpenTable and reservations are a must. If you plan to hit up a club I recommend having a late dinner around 9:30pm and moving upstairs to the club straight after.   This saves a painful wait in line (otherwise be prepared for selective entry) and the bonus of not having to pay a cover charge.",

    "text": "Tao is always a solid go-to spot when in Vegas. It's usually fairly easy to get a last minute reservation via OpenTable and they easily accommodate big parties. I've found that a later reservation is the way to go - maybe 9:30 or 10:00PM. That way they'll come around and stamp you for the nightclub so you can walk right past the line after dinner and pay no cover. Definitely a perk for a Friday/Saturday.   The food is good and has been consistent over the years. A sushi roll and appetizer is plenty for me before hitting the town. It's very easy to overeat here trying different items! The lobster dumplings are fantastic and so is the rock shrimp. Any sushi roll with mango and the sauce is a must try!   Also - they make a GREAT dirty martini!",

    "text": "ATMOSPHERE: Romantic ambiance with a modern twist on the Buddhist and Asian-inspired designs. As you walk in, you'll see a line of bathtubs filled with rose petals and lit candles on both sides of the entrance way. The entire restaurant is clean and dimly-lit.   FOOD QUALITY: Don't expect anything grand here for what you pay for. It's basically over-priced Chinese, Thai, and Japanese cuisine food. It's like the equivalent of eating at Panda Express or at some other Asian cuisine food court restaurant, except you're paying at least 3x as much for it. But then again, this is a restaurant right on the Vegas strip in Palazzo, so this shouldn't come as a surprise. After trying a couple of dishes, the only item that was actually good and worth its price would be the \"Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables\" ($39.00). The fish's flavor and texture were excellent.   SERVICE: I must say, our server Jeffrey was top-notch. He provided one of the best services I've ever had. Jeffrey was friendly, patient, and very easy to talk to. We had a group of 14 girls (bachelorette squad) and he was able to handle us like a pro. The bride's hair caught on fire from her dessert candle and one of the other servers who was passing by put it out within a second. Thanks for making sure our beautiful bride could return home to her fiance with a head full of hair.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: It's a good place to go to mainly for the atmosphere and service, just don't expect to be blown away by the quality of the food. Not saying the food was bad, it's just that you can get the same quality of food elsewhere for much cheaper. Also, there are so many better restaurant options in Vegas with high-quality service, atmosphere, AND food.",

    "text": "Flat out, we were disappointed on our first dinner at Tao. First, the design of Tao is engaging on a Vegas-scale. Pretty over the top, but in a good way. But what was plain weird was the music. They actually had a DJ during dinner, and he was playing what felt like exactly the wrong kinds of music, like something that could work well in a Hard Rock restaurant.   The food was not at all memorable, and mine was far too salty - and it was a noodle dish. It seems they put the most effort into not offending anyone with any of their food. It reminded me of PJ Changs, but a bit more expensive. They call it Fusion. I call it cop-out.  Their Tao hot tea blend was very good.  This one really got me. I asked for hot bean sauce, a staple at any real Chinese restaurant. They had nothing hot on the table, but was told all they had in the back was Sriracha. I love Sriracha, but in this setting, their own sauces should've lead the way. All we saw was a typical sweet sauce and mustard sauce for dipping; neither were better than average.   The last thing I have to mention is the waitstaff. Everyone was nice, but maybe too nice. It started to feel a bit like Disneyland. Our primary waiter (I think there were four assigned to our table) sounded more like a used-car salesman than an informative waiter. And another waiter just started talking with us, picking up a conversation we were having privately at the table. They're trying far too hard.  We're not going back. These guys really need to start living up their own hype. It all feels so old-school.",

    "text": "Why would anyone ever eat Americanized Asian food on the Las Vegas strip you may ask? And why would I give it 4 stars?  Here's the kicker: If you're hosting a large Bachelor party (10+ guys), and don't want to drop thousands of dollars on bottle service (face it, some people in your party don't mind spending, but others want to keep $$$ to a minimum), this is your place.  If everyone in your party orders an \"entree\" (which range from $30-$45), you get free admission into the club.  The best part is that you can bypass the ridiculous line altogether!  It's a win-win situation...considering the entrance fee would have been $40 for guys.  Keep in mind the club opens at 10pm, so schedule your dinner upwards of 8pm.    Going back to the food, my expectations were pretty low.  I was expecting extremely sub-par PF chang's style food, but I actually came out decently impressed.  I ordered the Pepper beef filet Mignon and it had quite a bit of meat and decent flavor.  The beef was tender and cooked pretty well.  The Sea bass would probably be the star entree here.  I got to try some of it and it was actually pretty good (think Yardhouse Sea Bass).  Long story short, if you're looking into getting 10 guys into a club and don't want to wait in line, Tao Asian Bistro should definitely be at the top of your list.  The food here is just a perk of getting into the club, but don't be surprised if you enjoy the food (stick with the pepper filet mignon, sea bass, or scallops and you'll be fine) . 4 stars.",

Call be biased or snobby, but I don't like to pay a lot for Asian food when I can get amazing food in Chinatown for half the price.   But I went along with it anyway.   We arrived a few minutes before our 7:45pm reservation. My friend (who knows more about the NBA than anyone I've ever met) caught sight of a small sign sitting outside the restaurant. The poster showed a just a pair of eyes and some small text. Of course, my friend recognized right away that these were no ordinary eyes. These were Lebron James's eyes. He read the sign with urgency. Turns out, Lebron was going to make an appearance at Tao Nightclub after eating at Tao Asian Bistro. My friend almost fell over with excitement. \"I don't care what it costs, that's where we are going afterwards.\" I laughed and agreed that we would inquire.   We walked through the hall of little basins filled with water and rose petals, and the hostess welcomed us immediately.   She walked us through the restaurant, which is dimly lit and has a huge Buddha on the first floor. The ceiling is decorated with large canvases of calligraphy writing. Stunning displays of portraiture line the back wall and restroom hallway. The hostess seated us on the second floor. The ambiance was just the right combination of bustling, formal/casual, and you know, that Vegas \"je ne sais quoi\".   Our waiter appeared promptly. He gave excellent cocktail and entree suggestions, and when asked, informed us that I (as a lady) would get in free to the Lebron party, and my friend would pay about $25. Which I'm sure was deeply discounted. Not only that, but we got stamps on our wrists to bypass the line.   I ordered the blueberry/pomegranate martini and it was delicious. My friend loved the Orient Express (a coffee-based martini). The tuna tartare was amazing, and I ordered the special (which was a short rib udon). The food blew our expectations away. Sure, it's a VERY expensive meal, but it's Las Vegas.   I thought they did an excellent job of offering a fusion selection that didn't over-complicate. They stayed True to Asian flavors and I liked that.   The service was hands down the best we experienced in Las Vegas. The chocolate fortune cookies at the end of the meal gave us fortunes that were hilarious, full of sexual innuendo, and right on point.   I would definitely recommend Tao. Our meal was pretty much flawless, outside of the $5 bowl of jasmine rice (really? five dollars? it was perfect rice, but come on, I can feed a family for a month with $5 worth of rice). More to come when I write up the review of the Lebron party at the Tao Nightclub.",

Our waiter was nice and attentive. We ordered pot stickers, not a bad choice. Then we got Kung Pao Chicken and Coconut Shrimp. Eh, the chicken was bad and I did not enjoy that dish at all. The shrimp was dry but it had a good flavor. They were big shrimp too.  The drinks were amazing but I went for the food. At the end of dinner we got a pass stamp for Tao Night Club. We didn't go.  Honestly, if I had to chose between Tao and PF Changs, PF would win.",

Our waitress was fantastic and everything was spot on. My girlfriend and I ordered a round of Sushi and split one of their small plate entrees of the sea bass. We liked everything so much, we ordered a second round. We truly enjoyed our experience at Tao!!!!!!!  The only negative: We were there at about 10:30 pm and as we were finishing, we were asked if we were interested in going up to the nightclub. We said sure and they stamped our hands. When we walked up, the guy told us we still needed to go outside and stand in line . . . even though we had dined there. I thought for sure I misunderstood, so asked him again and he was extremely rude. At that point I asked the hostess and she showed us the line. Sorry Tao . . . we had better things to do than stand in your line after we just dined at your restaurant. So . . . off to the next place!!! Way to take an enjoyable experience to a ticked off experience in a matter of minutes.",

    "text": "If God came down and said, \"Time to go! Where do you want to eat?\"  TAO!   Wow!  I'll be back, again and again and again and again!  It was the hubby's birthday so we celebrated.  The highlight was that Bono (U2) and Lebron James were here!  We didn't get to see any of these mega stars but I did see Lebron's birthday cake as it was being brought in, complete with basketball and crown!  I made these reservations weeks in advance and confirmed them several times. The restaurant is so intimidating which should be the opposite since it has such a Zen feeling as you walk in with the tubs at the entrance filled with orchids and candles.  The most surprising thing was seeing families for the early dinners.  I really thought this place was a couples romantic dinner place.  They also have a sushi bar.  We got there a little before 7 p.m. and someone had a baby and another family had some teenagers. It was a nice mixed crowd.  The very dark lounge is where we started and we were in the mood for Mai Tai's. Waitress took her time getting to us so we walked up to the bar.  We are big on birthdays.  Last year we went to Hawaii so the Mai Tai's seemed fitting since we stayed state side.  They were fabulous!  So if your a Mai Tai drinker, have one here. You get a nice slice of fresh pineapple too.  We got a booth and I have to say that I wasn't too happy since it wasn't facing the giant buddha.  But after our gorgeous waiter appeared, I mean our friendly waiter appeared all was forgotten (or was it the Saki bombers that did it?)  Every recommendation he made we took.  It was our first time here so we were happy to be guided through the menu.    We shared everything so we started with the Lobster Potstickers, it was served in a hot pot with mushrooms and this incredible sauce OMG it was so mild yet the most delectable tasting dish I have had in a really really really long time. Next for the main course was the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass-wow!  Another melt in your mouth experience.  We also had some wasabi crusted steak...melts in your mouth, it was like buttah.  We had some scallops and brown rice, it was honestly the best meal I've had in Vegas...it's one of the top 10 dinners that I've had in my life!   Our waiter Brad deserves his own review.   If Tommy Lee from Motley Crue had a handsome, classy, smart and sweet fabulous twin, this would be him.  Wow! 5-star service! He was super hospitable and friendly.   Very attentive and helpful. He's the best waiter in Vegas! Ask for Brad!  He also brought out a nice dessert for the hubby complete with candle and chocolate written HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate.  Brad was also nice enough to give all of us some VIP stamps to check out the nightclub for free! No waiting in line...woohoo!  The downer?  The restrooms say YIN and YANG or something along those lines. So if you've been hitting the sauce, you will just have to try a door. If you see a male bathroom attendant (like I did) you're in the wrong restroom (if you're a girl).    Another downer? It's one of those restrooms where you can see under the mirrors.  So ladies, if you want to do any SPANX or bra adjustments, do them in the privacy of the water closet. Otherwise, the dudes will get a great show (no wonder I started seeing $1 bills popping under the mirror! WT...?)  Check this place out if you come to Vegas! You'll love it!",

Also, one of the waiters spilled about a cup of soy sauce on my girlfriend. It wasn't hugely exciting when that happened. Another issue is the noise level in the restaurant area basically makes it impossible to talk to anybody.  However, the food is really good. Lots of great options for all sorts of tastes, the service was prompt once we were seated. You can't really go wrong with anything you order. I'd give it 3.5 stars because of the combination of lateness seating us, soy sauce all over my girlfriend, and noise level, but Yelp doesn't allow half stars, and it deserves more than 3.",

    "text": "By far the biggest disappointing experience in my life. What a let down. I had so high expectations.  We had a 10:30 pm reservation and ended up after 3 trips to the hostess station getting seated at 11:15 at a table that wasn't set up yet. Then after speaking to a manager got seated at another table. Let's start off between me and the other 3 people sitting at the table, we have a combined restaurant fine dinning experience and working in the industry over 70 years. From a Food Beverage Director of a hotel casino to restauranteur and founder of the most successful night clubs in Miami. That said I'm not f@&)ing around here.   The food was at the most a 6 from 1 to 10. The service though was pretty good and hospitable. But really pisses me off. When you sell your own filtered water that still tastes just like out if a fountain gun for $8. Specify on the menu that it's not bottled water. If wanted some Aquafina or Dassani I could had went downstairs at get for free from the casino host. Let me tell you. You have lost me and my thousand of  followers that ask me. \"Where I should go out tonight\".   Now to top it off to have a girl In a tub covered in rose petals and lighted candles  In the  front entrance as a decor at 1 AM in the morning. Is probably the most degreating thing I have ever seen.  To top it off. Holly shit !!!! The crowd that night after the Floyd Mayweather fight. They will let anyone in there. It looked like Miami Beach Memorial Day Weekend, or a episode of Hard Core Pawn.   Well enough said. They figure it's Vegas and million of people just stroll in no matter what.",

We shared a bunch of small plates that were incredibly authentic and full of flavor:  rock shrimp lettuce cups, lobster wonton, crispy orange chicken, shrimp tempura, singapore noodles, potstickers with chile  glaze and some sushi to top it off.  Of everything the sushi was the only thing I wasn't blown away by, but I'm a tough critic when it comes to sushi so take that into account.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Probably one of my new favorites.  Unfortunately I have to travel to Vegas to visit Tao...well maybe that's not such a bad thing!",

    "text": "We went here last night with a birthday party of 14. We arrived early but had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation to be seated which really made a lot of us cranky and frustrated.  When they sat us on the main floor we noticed an empty elevated long table section near us that was totally empty and could have accommodated us. The energy of the birthday girl was off at this point but we tried to cheer up the mood. We ordered the $75 per person family style menu because everyone was so hungry and agitated we knew if we all ordered individually it would further throw the party into a black hole.  Some guests were just saying bring out food, anything will do.   The line for the night club portion was piling up and packing the staircase which was horrible because it became a major task just to get to the restroom on the 2nd floor.  Security initially told the girls that was the only one while we were initially waiting to be seated so we did not know any better that there was a restroom on the main floor.   A girl came around and stamped our wrists and told us this is to get into the club upstairs after we finish dinner which seemed like a cool option that the restaurant seemed to give patrons and we decided that we would stay for the club after dinner instead of hesding out to Ballagio.  This later became a ridiculous ordeal because as we went up the packed staircase with our entire party the bouncer at the top stated that the stamp now did not give us admission but got us past the line outside. He told us to all go to the front door.   The look of disgust on the birthday girls face summed it up and trying to patronize the place further would just lead to further aggravation.   The only reason I gave this place one star is because the food was really good but I can't be really sure because when you are starving anything tastes good and some of the girls last meal was around noon so we were pretty hungry.",

We told him what we wanted to order and he seemed to be pushing the more expensive meals on us. We decided to go off his recommendation and we paid $40 just a one small peace of slimy sea bass.

We ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi, TAO Angry Dragon Roll, Lobster Wontons, Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass and Pad Thai Noodles with Shrimp.  My favorite dishes were the Lobster Wontons and the Sea Bass.  The seasoning was enough so that it's not too salty or spicy.  The sashimi was simple and had a hint of jalapeno (I didn't eat the jalapeno).  I had the Sake Flight which was not impressive.  I probably should have ordered a cocktail instead.  Overall the food was delicious but a bit pricey.  Our group of 4 people was perfect to share the different dishes.  The decor is unique with the large Buddha in the center, dimmed lights (you need a flashlight to read the menu) added a warm glow to the place.  We dined here around 8 p.m., the music was starting to get louder and we couldn't always hear each other talk.  I enjoyed the 80's music that was playing.  I would come here for the experience.",

    "text": "I came to Tao as a side trip for EDC, and about half way through the meal, I felt like I came to Vegas for Tao, and EDC was just a side trip.   I ate at Tao with a group of 8 people - family and friends, all a bunch of young adults in our twenties. We ordered family style (many plates in the center of the table to share), and in total, we destroyed 8 delicious dishes and a beautiful dessert smorgasbord. Every single thing we tried was delicious. I am spoiled in that my parents take me to nice places on occasion, and Tao is at the top 5 of my list of best meals I've ever eaten. One friend who ate with us said - and I quote, \"This is probably the best meal I will ever eat in my life.\" I am going to New York this fall or winter and plan to eat at the Tao restaurant in New York with my boyfriend. You can expect to hear another review on that restaurant soon.   My favorite dishes of the meal we had include:  - The flavorful 28 days aged new york steak which melted in my mouth - The miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass which tasted like it was injected with the best sauce ever created. Every bite gave you a gush of flavor, and it was cooked just right. - The Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame which came with a not-too-spicy wasabi dipping sauce. - The delicious mixed sashimi platter which had a wide variety of sashimi including fatty tuna.  - The gorgeous display of desserts (also ordered family style) which came with a hilarious and delicious giant fortune cookie and sweet dipping cream. The fortunes were Vegas-themed and made us laugh.   The atmosphere was nice and our server, Jeffery, was amazing. He always came at the right time, promptly filled our glasses, and was extremely helpful with the ordering process. He was absolutely hilarious, and super friendly. His language is what puts him over the top. The way he described the food as we were ordering was something from a movie or commercial. He used 2-3 descriptive - and one would even say seductive - adjectives for each dish. It's hard not to order them when he describes them that way. My brother put it best when he asked Jeffery, \"Could you please describe the food to me like that as I'm eating it?\" About a quarter of the way into our meal, the manager even came out to make sure we were all enjoying our food.   All in all, it was a perfect dinner, and a fantastic way to start our crazy night at the Electric Daisy Carnival.",

The reviews almost scared me away.  I am glad I gave Tao a try... Loved the ambience of the restaurant.  We were seated right next to the large budda.. Everyone in our party was pleased and had a great time...  Thank you Tao ... Until next time",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I absolutely LOVE Tao! The decor is amazing, the staff is very friendly & helpful, and the food is delicious. And if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. You can't beat that!   We visited Tao (Restaurant) on 4/1/10. We made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. I had the \"Crispy coconut shrimp with Thai peanut sauce\" and my date had the \"Soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach.\" Both dishes were great - Cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. However, I think the best part of the meal came at the end. Like any other Asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. But these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. The fortunes inside are a little more unique than most. Mine said \"You will receive a spanking in your near future\" and they bear the Tao logo on the corner. Definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal.   On the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in Las Vegas. Don't let this deter you - This place is worth the splurge! I highly recommend Tao - I know I will make time for Tao every time I go to Vegas!",

We got here just in time for our reservation and but had enough time to have a few round of shots at the bar. I was not too happy at the bar since there were not enough bartenders, but then I was not here to hang at the bar in any case.   Dinner was insanely perfect, am a big fan of Chinese fusion food and it was my night of gluttony. I would totally recommend the Thai crab cake with the Mango sauce, I know I devoured to the last speck. The next thing that I would not miss the next time am at Tao's is the Pork Dumplings, delicious!! But watch it, they can be really HOT!! Don't miss the Kung Pao Chicken here, I know it sounds gross, I too would save it for P.F Changs but it seriously was different and you will not regret it. Also try the shrimp in coconut sauce, but you should be a coconut friendly person. Overall great food and absolutely great service.  Try the Mochi tasting for dessert or the mango rice pudding with ginger icecream or even better to try the Tao's Chocolate Martini... you would be in heaven for the next few minutes.  Overall a great night. I wish I didn't eat as much as I did since I had no desire to be on the dance floor after tons of food in my tummy... I think we stayed at Tao's the entire night and totally had a blast.",

It was as if they were doing everything they could to get us in and out as fast as possible.  The individual assisting our waiter kept taking our food before we were done - even after I told him to stop.  After spending $100 a plate I'd like to finish my food.   After all of this, I tried desperately to speak to a manager without any luck.  It was as if the employees at Tao were intentionally preventing me from speaking with a manager because they were afraid they'd get in trouble.  They told me that I had to talk to the general manager.  I called twice and they finally transferred me to his voice mail which obviously wasn't the general manager.   Seems like something a general manager shouldn't be handling anyway.  The food was okay.  We ordered Peking Duck.  I've had better.  The only good thing the whole night was our waiter Dave.    After my experience here, I am telling everyone I know not to eat here.",

    "text": "I tried giving Tao Restaurant a second chance, but it has still failed to redeem itself from previous experiences. A huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. I called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we STILL had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. What's the point of making a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? The hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"Your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. I have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.  Finally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering AC system, us poor gals decked out in Vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. The fish clay pot I had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so I played it safe and ordered the black peppered filet mignon w/ udon once again. It took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. The miso glazed Chilean seabass was one of the best dishes at the table. Who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status.   I still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for fried rice is just flat out absurd. The only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. Smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at Tao, but after this experience, I'd much rather scout for VIP passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.  PS: Don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper filet mignon. I walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. Hawtness.",

The music's too loud, the food's too expensive, and it's just too long to sit down for me when I'm in Vegas and there's a ton of stuff I want to make sure I have time to do.  But I come here for one reason, and one reason only.  CHILEAN SEA BASS.  This place has orgasmic fish-orgy-in-your-mouth watering CHILEAN SEA BASS ($34).  I look forward to eating this dish every time I go to Vegas, simply accompanied by a side of white rice.  I also had some $14 appetizer of tuna tartare which was delicious but I could have done without.  Topped off with a nice bottle of Sake and we kicked off the night right.  I was a little apprehensive about eating here with my friends on a bachelor party trip.  The thought of 10 guys eating at Tao together late night made me think like we'd look like a bunch of freaks, but literally every table there was a large group of males or females, but not both.  Makes sense right?  No one wants extra baggage in Vegas.  Last point....when you order water you better say tap or they're gonna bring you some Voss and charge you $7 for it.",

But, seriously - a genuine smile occasionally from the hostesses wouldn't hurt!  Front of house rudeness is not tolerated by most. Lucky for Tao, we like the Kobe Tao Shabu Shabu dish & Miso Sea Bass too much to stay away!  Anthony was our server - he was excellent. Drinks came out quick this time, which was a first....I'm guessing down to an earlier reservation, so it wasn't too busy at the bar AND because Anthony was so competent  ;-)  Our other Asian/Fusion fix is SushiSamba, where the hostesses actually smile when they greet you - if it weren't for the fantastic dark atmosphere in Tao, we would just stick to SushiSamba.",

My recommendations: Shrimp and Lobster Dumplings, Kung Pao Chicken, sushi of your choice- tasted very fresh, and I loved the seaweed sampler.   It was a great setting for a group, a bit loud if you are looking to be able to talk to everyone all at once, but great for small conversations all around the table.

However, had our server known that our bar tab alone would have made up for whatever entrees a normal table would have ordered, I think he would have been nicer.  As soon as the words \"we'll be splitting\" came out, the server rolls his eyes and takes our orders. It was a good 20 minutes before he came back, brought our food in the wrong order, and proceeding to ignore us again. We watched as he visited every table around us, including one with 4 girls who each ate 1 dish and drank water (aka... prob not going to be getting a big check). It got to the point where we asked one of the bussers to see if they could get us another drink.  Food was okay  - got the sea bass and lo mein noodles.

    "text": "Since Tao was conveniently located in the Venetian where I was staying, we decided to go there for dinner.  I love the walkway inside with the floating rose petals and the super comfy couch to sit on while waiting for your table.  We had reservations but still had to wait about 10 minutes which isn't too bad considering how mobbed it was.  The ambiance is swanky Asian and kind of dark which is nice.  We promptly ordered drinks upon sitting down.  I had the Lychee martini made with Ketel One, Triple Sec, and Lychee puree.  It was fucking fantastic - tasted fruity but not overly sweet and there was a piece of lychee on a skewer in the drink for you to munch on.  I can't say I've ever had this before but I will definitely try any lychee drink from now on.  For food we were a bit random and ordered a few different things.  We had the chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce.  I freakin love Thai peanut sauce so I loved this little appetizer.  Then we had some sushi rolls - I think they were spicy tuna - and they were also pretty good.  For our entree though we had Peking duck since our waitress told us they were known for this dish.  For $34 per person it better be phenomenal and perhaps cure cancer.  It came out and it is basically almost an entire duck served with what amounted to Asian tortillas and hoisin sauce.  There were also some onions and cucumbers to put on your tortilla.  I tried it with the tortilla but it just reminded me of an Asian taco so I just ate the duck alone.  The skin was shiny and crispy and the duck was juicy and fatty.  I don't know if it was worth $34 but it was damn delicious!  Eating it with chopsticks was a bit of a challenge so by the time we got to the drumstick I just picked the meat off with my hands...no shame in my game!  Overall I was pleased with Tao and could definitely see going back to try some other things on the menu that looked interesting.",

    "text": "SUMMARY: Located in the Grand Shopping Canal, TAO serves as a restaurant with an adjoining club that has housed many popular DJs. However, the restaurant itself is not good, the dishes are too sweet, and the only redeeming quality is the space... but that gets old quickly when you're hungry. Service was good as our waitress offered to swap one of our dishes after complaining about how sweet one of the dishes was.   VERDICT: I would not recommend eating here and will not return here.  ITEMS ORDERED: (1) Chicken pad thai -- how on EARTH can this dish be so sweet? I'm still puzzled by the overwhelming sweetness of the dish. Actually, all of our dishes were quite sweet, so whoever's in the back kitchen telling people to add more brown sugar to make the dish more \"Asian fusion\" or whatever needs to cut it out because it's not tasty. (2) Scalloped curry dish -- I'm not sure what this one was called, but this one was actually okay. Probably the best dish out of the ones we ordered. I drowned the chicken pad thai with the remainder of this curry sauce to try to cut some of the sweetness.  (3) Five Spice Space Ribs -- okay, this dish was weird because I would have thought spare ribs meant that you left the bone in? But all of the pieces were quite tender. This dish was okay, but like I already mentioned, all of these dishes were quite sweet for whatever reason. (4) Sashimi -- My dad ordered a sashimi platter that is probably the best thing to order if you've made the unfortunate decision of eating here. You get a variety of fish but the cuts are quite thin.  (5) Chinese broccoli -- we had originally ordered some wilted sauteed green dish but that was (shocker!!) too sweet and switched to this dish, which was better, but also I really wish I didn't have this experience eating here.   Going to Vegas with your family can be tough, especially when it comes to figuring out what to eat. Therefore, I hope my review helps you decide not to eat here. It's True that the inside decor is cool, and the club itself must be fun, but the food is not good and will leave you feeling bloated and miserable after from the amount and sweetness packed into it.",

But if you have eaten good Chinese or Asian fusion you'd say this was a tiny bit above average. I think an average meal at PF Chang's is about the same.

Remember you're still in Vegas at a tourist hotel.  I'm not one for trendy places.  My experience has been that trendy places are trendy because of the decor, pretentious people who made it trendy due to excellent marketing.    I had a sushi dinner that wasn't at the top of my food experiences but it was above average.  The fish tasted fresh but the presentation was lacking.  The soup that came with it was ok.  Also, the dinner was short on pieces and the pieces were small, but the price was not small.    Is Tao trendy, yes.  Is Tao a local favorite, no.  It's a tourist trap but I enjoyed the experience.  I would go again if I'm staying close, but I would not make a special effort to return to Tao.  Give it a try, you'll at least like the decor, atmosphere and service, but I believe there is better food in Vegas that is not part of the Vegas tourist trappings.",

We ordered the Peking duck, lobster wontons, miso soup, coconut shrimp, vegetable fried rice and the spring mountain sushi roll. I wasn't disappointed with anything, however my personal favorites were the lobster wontons and the Peking duck. The portion size of the Peking duck is huge. While priced per person, it really is huge and would definitely recommend only having a light appetizer or no appetizer when ordering because the portion size is so big. Would definitely come back.",

The entrance is one of the best I've seen. The flower filled tubs are a nice touch which you will appreciate and probably won't see anywhere else. The decor is over the top but very well placed with multiple spots around the restaurant for pictures. The service was quick and our server very helpful in suggesting starters, main courses but keeping an eye on our time because we were on a time crunch. We had tickets for a show but we also wanted to enjoy a great meal ... and we sure did!",

Now, sashimi that melts in your mouth, order the trio for an easy option. Rolls, soups and green beans all superb. Then the dessert, sorry, I only had room for one. Three types of chocolate Buddah's in a sweet take home box.  My only hesitation, when will you hear me say this.....the food came out too fast. Maybe order a little at a time and enjoy the wait.",

The yellowtail sashimi wasn't very good. Not horrible but not like it can be done. The wheels came off the buss at the main course. Miso glazed Chilean sea bass with wok vegetables. I should have known better than getting a dish like this. Sorta my fault. The waitress said it was her favorite and I could see it being decent if it had been at all fresh and not fishy and stinky.  I'm not sitting on the porcelain goddess writing this review as it completely trashed the system. Super cool atmosphere, DJ was playing some fun music, service was good, decent drinks, bad fish. Lol.

    "text": "So I've taken a little break from Tao since my last incident. This time around, I wanted to give it another shot. I remember the food being great, regardless of what we had ordered. Well I'm glad I came back because the food was awesome! We started with the lobster dim sum, which was honestly OKAY, I wasn't a huge fan. A spicy tuna hand roll which was excellent, the orange chicken, and the lobster fried rice. What I love about tao is that their food is very consistent. Always tasting great regardless of which time you visit.  Our server was also great! Knew he menu really well to point out specifics. I didn't like that our table was wobbly the entire time we were eating. Clearly their turn over is pretty high. I would think they would have replaced it by now instead of trying to insert pieces of wood on the bottoms that don't solve the issue.  I hate to dwell on a similar issue, but the host was horrible. Our reservations were for 9:45 and we arrived at 9:50. He told us they were cleaning off our table and will take us back shortly. At 10pm I ask about our table and he says \"any minute now\". Well 10:15 rolls around and he points me out and asks for my last name again... whattttt.... I think he could tell I was furious. 30mins of standing around and you don't even check me in?! Well, we got seated shortly after; to find that there were plenty of tables available throughout the restaurant. The best part.... when the girl was walking us to the table she goes \"you will be sitting upstairs, is that okay with you...\" I ask if we can sit downstairs and she goes \"there will be a bit of a wait\" I told her we waited enough and she replies \"perfect, right this way then\". I think a refresh on customer service and etiquette wouldn't hurt for anyone at the front desk!",

Service was not good and the manger kept telling us we were the best table as they were seating multiple  people one after another in front of us. I was so excited come here and will now look for another place in Vegas.   Previous review   Amazing!!!! Amazing!!! Amazing!!!  This restaurant is so beautiful, great service and the food is exceptional!!! The miso glazed Chilean sea bass is MUSt!  Definitely a great place to visit in vegas!!!

    "text": "Large parties dining at Tao should know this.... ___________________________ To my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  I dined at Tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of August 13, 2007. Although I was disappointed with Tao, I still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends.   I don't remember everything we had, but I enjoyed the Spare Ribs, Lobster Wontons, Chilean Sea Bass. Least favorite was the Pad Thai (one of the worst I've had) and chicken skewers.   Reason for 2 stars: After we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. When she came by, she was friendly but did not communicate clearly how she was taking our order. Since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. She specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. That took me by surprise b/c I thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? So I repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? We decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary.   When the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. What we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. She NEVER once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.  If we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. I can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food.   When we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. We then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscommunication. This is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. The least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards.   I have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. I've always said, I want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.  I would not go back to this restaurant again. Food was good but not worth the price.   The club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. We got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed upstairs to the night club. Seems like a classy place but I find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.",

The cocktails were not the best, I sent back my \"geisha\" drink twice before they got it within an acceptable range.",

Mediocre to acceptable food, high cost for small portions, slow service, and a poorly laid out restaurant design lacking anything visually appealing. Ok, the big Buddha was pretty cool, but that was about it. Between food, service, and atmosphere, would think they have got one of them right? All lacked substance. Seemed like a restaurant that is resting on its laurels. Since this is about Vegas, herding people in, getting as much money as they can, and then some, it is what it is. What it is not, a place I would come back.",

The decor is incredible and although the restaurant is big, it's still intimate because the tables are located on different levels.

With the purchase of a main entree, you do get access to the nightclub, but we were too tired to go at the end of the day. Servers are very knowledgeable and professional.

Expect to spend like $75 a person if you order a 3 course meal with drinks.  I highly recommend this to any group, party or couple visiting Las Vegas.

Menu is very limited, quality nothing to write home about. They gave us all sticky forks, and we had to ask for new ones. Service was average.

    "text": "Very disappointed in this place. I got hyped up by the 5 start reviews but TAO is far from 5 stars. We were politely greeted by our server who was very enthusiastic about the place. I asked him what the most popular dish was & he responded with \" Miso Glazed Sea Bass \" . The fish was cooked properly, tasted & looked great. We also ordered \"Omakase\" style sushi which means that the consumer trusts the chef to create a plate based on his skills & tastes. This is where i was very disappointed, we payed $58 for 6 or 7 pieces of basic, dull sushi. Nothing creative or original. If i may add i personally think that Whole Foods sushi is gourmet compared to TAO sushi. After a disappointing dinner i had conversed with our waiter for a few minutes about fine dinning & how TAO is not anywhere near that. Once he realized that i am a True connoisseur of fine cuisine he immediately started to blame the restaurant for catering to people who don't get to try Asian cuisine & wont expect a 5 star quality, and thats why i wouldn't be impressed by anything there. He himself recommended us to a few 5 star sushi restaurants around town. For $120 with gratuity i feel like this place is not only a rip off but very hyped up for absolutely no reason besides the decor inside. Never going to dine at this establishment again.",

    "text": "7:30pm reservation.  Arrived on-time and seated promptly.  The place was already packed and there was a good vibe.  Not too loud, not too quiet.  Our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.  Drinks- Tao-tini..  They were good.  Smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  Didn't really feel the effects so I'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.  There was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  Super cheap.  Both the gf and I went with this option.  First course- spicy tuna tartare over crispy rice.  Yum.  She went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  Again yum.  Second course-  Fried vegetable rice.. eh ok.  She went with the roasted peppers.  Neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.  Third course-  Wasabi crusted filet with tempura onion rings.  Two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  Unfortunately I ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  After taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  I'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so I just left it alone.  I finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.  Fourth course-  Chocolate spring rolls and a citrus dipping sauce.  Very good and very rich.  Juniper apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  Nothing special, but good none the less.  If we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, I know my review would be completely different based on my filet mignon not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  With that aside, I did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with Bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.",

Bartenders are particularly unfriendly but it's forgivable as I'm not a 7 star high roller that'll tip then $100 to stare at their boobs all night. On to the meal, the ENTIRE staff was a dream. Our servers was awesome and friendly without being fake. Our busser was sweet as well and on top of his game. Unfortunately a glass broke next to us and the manger all but RAN over to make sure we were all a-ok. On the the food, while delicious, the portions are VERY small. Hence, my 4 star review.",

The food was mediocre and the service was completely horrible. I would be more adamant in refusing to come back except I'm probably not going back to Vegas anytime soon anyway.  My friend made a reservation at Tao for a late dinner. Some members of our group were a little late, but still made it to the restaurant before our reservation was cancelled. For no particular reason, the waitstaff at Tao decided that the appropriate action was to make our group wait before seating us. During the 1+ hour wait, my friend kept going to the host to find out the table situation, as the rest of the group watched patrons finish their meals and the restaurant clear out. Partway through our wait there were numerous empty tables, yet it took another 15-30 minutes to be seated.  My friend complained to the manager of the restaurant, who apologized profusely and brought over our waiter, and made lavish promises to make up for the ordeal our group had been through. They promised free shots, a couple free appetizers, and \"special service\" from the chef. Well, we received the free shots and some edamame. I never figured out what the \"special service\" was...   Overall, the experience flat-out sucked. Food was okay, but that's probably only because I was starving by the time it arrived at the table. The time we saved waiting in line was negated by the wait for a table. And if the manager makes an apology I expect him to HONOR it.",

Could I open a retail establishment with an 'exotic' name like Shangri-La, Tao, or Buddha Bar and start raking in the bucks because Americans believe in exotica due to never traveling internationally?  Le Bistro??  Le Car????  This place is as overrated as they come. My bias is that I don't like Vegas in general, but this place reminds me of the worst fakey aspects of Vegas, Hollywood, and Beverly Bills. The real Buddha might have laughed his belly off at the vanity, superficiality, and ego-parfum of this place, or silently glided through the materialistic depravity.  I had a vegetarian bowl....about 3.00 worth of vegetables with a 400% markup, which was my fault. I read some online reviews that were all so glowing I lost my marbles and went. Lost some bucks, and more importantly I wasted another sliver of my life. Going to Vegas even for that 80 minutes, after being in Zion National Park , almost ruined the serenity I gained the during the whole trip.  The restaurant Tao has nothing to do with the real Way of the Tao, as far as I can see. It's just another trendy, forgettable, disposable waste of time and money, situated in a shopping mall!",

It's definitely not the place to be if you're looking to have a quiet conversation.  I loved the electronica being played in the background and they make great drinks.  My beef is that despite having reservations, you have to wait in line to check in, then wait in the lounge while they prep your area.  My dish of choice here is always the Peking duck.  I'll never understand though why they charge for 2 people when I ask for 1 order, perhaps that's the default?  If that's the case they should just have a base price on the dish of $68, rather than $34 / person.  I always enjoy ordering the spicy tuna over crispy rice, but couldn't' find it in the menu this time.",

In fact, we took a bite out of the spareribs and decided not to eat it. It had a really strong sweet honey flavor that was just off-putting. Giving it a three star because the rest of the food is ok.",

The food? Hmmmm, I have to be picky when it comes to Asian food, especially Asian Fusion. But this is beyond my tolerance: I never had such overpriced and terrible Asian/American in my whole life.  My bf ordered Kung Pao chicken and I ordered Salmon sashimi special...When the waiter brought them over, we were like....THAT'S ALL??? Salmon Sashimi($16): It's literally four slices of Salmon with some guacamole underneath. Kung Pao Chicken ($29): it's a small bowl of rice, with some swee t n sour chicken around it, and some chopped onions and bell pepper. YUP, THAT'S ALL.  UM, THAT'S ALL. WE WERE SPEECHLESS.",

Everything was great. The only thing I can complain about is that the NY location has (or had .. I don't know anymore because I haven't been in a long time) a bigger cocktail menu which included a mojito menu. I specifically remember a blackberry mojito which was amazing. Unfortunately, they don't have a mojito menu at this location.",

There are tubs filled with flowers as you walk in.  The decor is really pretty and there is a huge Buddah statue in the restaurant.  They have a nice sized menu.  I would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things I found weird.  I am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  He helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  There was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  The food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price I would hope it is) so I don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  I ended up ordering vegetable fried rice and asked if they could add pineapple because I saw they used it in another dish.  The waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  They did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  Again, I think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.  Other than that I have to say the food was delicious.  My rice was very good.  The vegetable dumplings were so good we got a second order. The vegetable sides I was able to order were tasty.  My husband had a pepper steak dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.    During the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to Vegas to get married.  They did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.  It was a huge fortune cookie that when cracked open contained what tasted like both a chocolate and a vanilla mousse.  Whatever it was, it was adorable and tasted very nice.  I did enjoy the experience and the food and would love to eat here again next time I visit Vegas.",

They had a table set up all the way up to the hallway door for the restrooms - with a chair in the way of all patrons.  LOVED the Duck Lettuce Wraps, and the Sashimi dinner.  We'd come here again",

We got stamped to go in to the club and left to go to the casino for a half hour. We came back and the bouncer claimed I was wobbly and too drunk to come in, and said to come back in 45 minutes. I felt fine but regardless we respected the decision and came back an hour later. He spotted me in the line before i got to him he said you can't come in, you wobbled a bit. I was appalled because I had 3 drinks the whole night and hadn't got 2 hours prior to this event. We felt singled out because we were guys and we even spoke to the manager who could tell that I was sober but since I got angry at the bouncer for being unreasonable we could not come in. I am a Vegas local and have come to the TAO restaurant regularly and bring my guests there. I will never go to TAO again nor would recommend anyone spending money at this restaurant/club.",

That is how much we liked this restaurant. To celebrate my husband s birthday I booked a table for saturday night, weekend in December, very clearly mentionning that it was to celebrate a birthday at the moment of reservation. I was looking forward to having the duck dish. We started off with the lychee cocktail. It was not to our liking. Very strong and it had no taste of lychee. Just a very strong taste of alcohl. My husband asked for more juice and the juice supposidly , lychee tasted more like DETERGENT !!  nothing to do with what we had previously in Tao. Next came the duck dish, it was just lookwarm, nearly cold. obviously heated dish maybe in the micro wave  I cannot tell you how dissapointed we were. We are both hard working people and this dish was expensive, no problem if it had been delicious as I remembered it to be previously. We were expecting a desert with a candle, nothing of the sorts !! We ordered a desert, received  it but still no candle.  Then to top the evening, the young lady, our waitress, was very cockey, nearly rude, She had absolutely no idea of what customer service meant. No idea. I called the manager and he asked : what can I do for you??? NOTHING. JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT TAO IS NOT THE SAME PLACE THAT I ENJOYED GOING TO.  I am so sorry to have to write this, we will NEVER go back. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. We passed the bar on our way out, on a Saturday night it always was full, this time it was nearly empty, TAO must have LOST a lot of their customers.",

That is the ONLY thing that my Tao Restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had I asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. We had reservations for Saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. Friends were gathered from Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco. We had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. We were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall Buddha statue. Our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.  The standouts for me appetizer-wise were the vegetable dumplings and egg rolls (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). My carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon tail spare ribs and meat potstickers. Through it all, the wine kept pouring.  Our entrees came and I was dazzled by my Typhoon Lobster with Fingerling Potatoes and Spicy Stir Fry. This is when the bib would have come in handy because when I was done it looked like I had massacred an aquatic beast! Fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered.   I will mention that the pair who ordered the Peking Duck for 2 were indifferent to it. The description had sounded amazing but did NOT live up to their expectations. Everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. Then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.  Over the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. It included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. Simply incredible and I am not generally a dessert person.   From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave Tao you feel as though you are experiencing something unique, exotic, and daring. The decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. Thank you Tao for making my birthday dinner one I will never forget.",

    "text": "I went to Tao with three friends and we were very disappointed in our experience.   We were rushed through the entire meal.  The server kept hovering around the table to take our order even though we were just seated.  After we placed our order, he forgot to bring one of the appetizers.  Then, our entrees were brought out before we finished our appetizers.  We were asked about dessert before the table was cleared.  It is unusual for four women not to want dessert, but we were just not up for any with the remains of dinner in front of us.  We did like the atmosphere.  The food was good, although I wish my meal, the Roasted Buddha Chicken, was a larger portion.  Overall, we were really looking forward to a nice night and meal, and Tao did not measure up due to service issues.",

    "text": "I am giving Tao 4 stars based on my other experiences in Las Vegas, particularly on the Strip.  Restaurants there are generally over-priced.  You have to remember that Las Vegas is far from any port so if you are visiting from a town where they choose their fish daily from the port side fish market and you like seafood, they have a bit of a challenge here. We went with a group of 7. We enjoyed both the bar and the restaurant.  Another yelper complained about the glass wine list, I don't mind trying new wines so I actually thought it was a good list.   This is not a place to go for group discussion, you can't hear across the table.  But so long as you have good dinner partners on either side of you, you'll have a great time.  Beautiful People watching gets an A+.  The vibe and the atmosphere is definitely fun. Most of our party got the miso seabass which as someone mentioned miso fish (officially called \"saikyo\" preparation in Japanese) is always good.  I was very happy with my seafood hotpot that included nice sized scallops, shrimp and chunks of lobster.   At the bar they serve complementary wasabi dried peas that are totally addictive. We were at the Venetian for a trade show and had a big day following so we didn't take advantage of the VIP tickets to the club that they gave us with our dinner.",

NEVER make the mistake of going to the lounge and feeling hungry right before the kitchen closes. You will regret it because it SMELLED good in the lounge, but the results were not so much.  Chef's roll = EWW, EWW, EWW and tiny for the amazing price of $16!!   I am generally against these type of Asian restaurants that are kinda fusion, but when you get hungry late, you get desperate. Our waiter was nice and was on top of it, so the star is for him.  Maybe it's better when you go for actual dinner, so don't take my review for that (although you might wanna stay away from the Chef's roll then too).",

Service is always outstanding and you can always request best seat in the house.  It is pricey, but worth it.  Great music, great drinks, great food and great \"scene and be seen\" place.

FYI, tao was the highest grossing indepenent restaurant in the US in 2006. ($55 mil, that's $16 mil more than No.2). they must be doing something right.  tao's service was surprisingly great although we arrived 8-ish without reservation. we were seated promptly with courtesy. our server was super nice and informative, as he explained every single dishes we've ordered as they arrived at our table.  interior deco was as usual. check it out for yourself on their website.   some of the dishes we've tried:  small plate: thai stuffed shrimp with garlic, lime, and thai chili sauce  small plate: satay of chilean sea bass with wok roasted asparagus wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura of onion rings chef's roll desert: chocolate zen parfait  the food was all excellent, but this place is really more about the vibe and the people-watching. tao is a popular destination for private parties among celebrities. the bill came out to be around $130, including a couple of drinks. not bad for a fun dinner in vegas.  i would definitely visit there again next time i go to vegas.",

Note: Your required to confirm the day of the reservation before Noon.  Checked in with the matre' D was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  It was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? There was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  We were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. Before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  In celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and Voss Sparkling water. After reviewing the menu, I asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, I thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  We ordered:  Satay of chilean sea Bass with grilled asparas, Wasabe crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings, Duck friend rice,Noodles and Short-ribs.  The food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  There are so much more comparable quality food here in SF  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  Needless to say I wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and I was paying to be part of the scene.  Now Kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  I'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, I thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female Ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner I still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  Above and Beyond.   In summary: Tao Restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  Especially for those of you who live here in SF.",

The atmosphere is drastically different than the rest of the Venetian. I totally loved it. From the large Buddha statue to the lighting, Tao definitely has an awesome ambiance! I had the wasabi-crusted filet mignon. This was to die for...I'm still thinking of it as I type! The wasabi gave the beefiness of the filet the perfect edge. I scarfed it all down! The rest of my party had sushi, which they thoroughly enjoyed. The best part is that we received stamps to enter Tao Nightclub as well. I highly recommend giving Tao a try!",

The atmosphere is very cool and hip with a great vibe going on all night there....we did go to the club afterwards and while the website shows this as a big looking club we actually found it to be a bit cramped an small for the amount of people they let in....unless you get bottle service be prepared to feel like a second class citizen....the security people are somewhat militant as one time I set my drink down to simply put on my blazer and was immediately approached that I was not allowed to set my drink there....a bit ridiculous and extreme IMHO.   We will definitely go back to the restaurant but will skip the club even if it offers free admission with our dining experience as It was not enjoyable.",

We didn't think we would get in but much to our surprise they had a table ready right away for us.  The sever took almost 10 minutes to greet the table so we were a little worried things would not go well. After the drink order was taken our waitress did an excellent job explaining the menu and making good solid recommendations.  Our table ordered 4 appetizers and each of us decided on an entree.   The restaurant being Asian has a very unique decor which is dark and full of Asian style statues. We sat in a large round booth that made it very easy for our group to reconnect and converse as the dining experience progressed. Staff members were seen constantly moving around making sure all guests were enjoying their experience.   Drinks we great and didn't take long to arrive. The apps made it to the table in less than ten minutes from the time the order was place. The were all amazing and hot which is something I am very particular about.  The suggestions made by our waitress were spot on and the selections were enjoyed most by our table. This showed a True understanding of the menu.   Dinner arrives and the food was hot and delicious. Again the waitress recommended the Chilean Sea Bass which I ordered and was not disappointed. The fish was cooked perfectly and was accompanied by some perfectly seasoned wok vegetables. Other at the table also enjoyed their meal selections and once the meal concluded several all agreed that we made a fantastic choice for dinner.   The only reason not a 5 star selection we were not offered any after dinner drinks or desert to round out an already awesome experience. I recommend the restaurant and plan to stop by again in April when I am back in town.",

We arrived on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't that busy but we made reservations anyway for a party of 6.  I love the sexy Asian, contemporary atmosphere; It's very chic and upscale. I just wish there was a little more lighting to show off their interior decor even the more!  Their service was splendid and on point.  Our waiter was very detail oriented and also gave a great introduction and set the high expectation for the evening.  He recommended the chef special; it's basically an all you can eat smorgasbord and the chef makes what he recommends.  We did not take advantage of this because our party had too many food restrictions but I'm sure any party would!  We ordered the strip teriyaki steak, rainbow sushi, Orange chicken, and chili sea bass.  I highly recommend the strip steak and sea bass.  Both were perfectly cooked and very tender.  The sea bass felt like it melted in your mouth.    A great restaurant for any celebration; with a party or a romantic dinner for couples.  You'll definitely want to make a reservation and put on cocktail attire for this visit!",

Since were already staying at the hotel, we figured we might as well stay and not have to worry about getting around during the festivities.  The atmosphere, decor and great looking people is what makes this place the place to be.  With the dark ambiance accompanied with the vibrant red throughout, make this place unique to other spots on the strip.  The food was delicious but it was a very loud dining experience.  With large groups living extravagantly, everyone celebrating random occasions and people just overall having a good time.  I wouldn't consider this place an ideal date night if you are searching for a romantic spot but it is a place to see and be seen if you catch my drift.  The lychee martini was yummy according to my wife and worth the price. Their tempura shrimp and ribs and lacquered ribs were on point.  Their fried rice was surprisingly good too!  Can't complain about the service.  Everything was 5 stars.  I'll be back for sure but probably not for NYE.",

The food was phenomenal and the service was impeccable. I forgot our servers name but she was very attentive and helpful. The only drawback was the pricing on some of the items because of how little you get but overall great!!!",

Because I can literally walk to any shop here in SF, even a mediocre sushi place and it would taste better than that. Heck I can even make my own sushi better than that!! This place isn't even mediocre. It's beyond disgusting! All I know is these sushi is so gross, I had spit it back out. It's that bad. Why is there VINAIGRETTE SAUCE inside sushi? LMFAO. And the bill was 100$ for 3 rolls of sushi and a giant fortune cookie that looks good but taste like shittttt. I mean serious? The cookie is not crunchy at all, it's like eating a half wet cardboard box, and the chocolate inside the cookie is just nasty as hell! Seriously, this meal isn't even worth 1$. The food here, sushi and the fortune cookie taste like old food sat in the storage for 4 months.. it just old rubbery taste.. like never again. And for 100$  you funny. I'm never back again. Take ur 100$ and add 70$ head on over to Hell's Kitchen instead and you'll get a full 3 course meal there for this price",

She was well versed in all the menu items at Tao and was well able to describe anything you asked about. Her descriptions and suggestions were very detailed. She was also friendly and complimentary. We specifically talked with the manager and let her know how much we appreciated the service. Jamie is a True leader and should be teaching men and woman, worldwide the art of service!

After I complained, we were then seated next to the DJ and across from noisy bar! It took all my willpower not to walk out because I've read some great reviews and was looking forward to our dining experience. Big mistake!   The restaurant is huge with many levels of seating for dining and had a club atmosphere and not conducive to enjoying great Asian cuisine chatting with friends. This place definitely caters mostly to the nightclub set. And it was only 7:15pm and people at the bar were over the top!   After waiting for about 40 minutes (unacceptable) we ordered our food. Since it was hard to have a normal conversation with my husband during dinner  we ate in silence and got out of there as soon as we could. This Foodie is not used to this kind of treatment!   By the time the food arrived we were starving so we dug into the Peking Duck Spring Rolls with Hoison sauce which was very flavorful and we both enjoyed it. Thank goodness! However it was the only dish that was good out of the 3 dishes we ordered! The Crispy Coconut Shrimp with THAI Peanut Sauce ($33.00 for 6 medium shrimp) was pricey and I did like the flavor of the peanut sauce with the shrimp but my husband said to him they were just uninteresting.   I did like the flavor of our 3rd dish Mandarin Fried Rice with roasted Pork however my husband said it reminded him of Panda Express at 5 times the cost!   With all the many choices in restaurants in Las Vegas this restaurant does not get our vote and we will not be back!",

    "text": "Yes, it's time for another episode of \"Yes, I went here. Yes, stranger things have happened, OK?!\"  TAO Asian Bistro is the most famous of the TAO restaurants. I entered ambivalent. The TAO downtown (Manhattan) is one of the most unprofessional restaurants I've ever been to, and the only time when my party was rushed out to make room for other guests. What?! You expect this on United Airlines when they overbook, not a swank bank restaurant. Then there's the cultural appropriation question*** -- giant Buddha in lobby as decor -- and the hip environment of EDM, mood lighting, and impeccable wall details that YOU. ARE. PAYING. FOR. IN. MENU. MARKUP.  But that was TAO NYC, and I was curious about TAO Vegas. Whether it's Cirque du Soleil or Hakkasan, the Vegas outpost is typically the standard setter that all others -- including Manhattan, yes -- must follow. Further, this is where Cleveland Cavalier JR Smith infamously partied after the surprise 2016 Cavs championship, and look, I wanted to see it (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FXhgrJ4fYVLjyr0wPnDhmCAyXIZM%3D%2F1x0%3A415x276%2F1400x1400%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281x0%3A415x276&s=06470839ebcefec610a4eba3020b8473dbad992176123ff67289266e9cc712d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/...</a>):format(png)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49901247/shirtless_jr.0.0.PNG)  I'm happy to report that this one is a lot better than the one in Manhattan, with better P2P (price to portions) ratio, too, and an environment that makes both un-cool people like me feel as \"at home\" as people wearing Balencia (sp). There were even some children in our area, so it's a \"family restaurant\" in some ways.  I recommend just getting a smattering of small dishes: lacquered pork was incredible, as was the soy chicken. You can't go wrong with the sushi or rolls, though they aren't sublime. Duck spring rolls were a bit of a bust. I didn't taste much duck. The bread pudding dessert was amazing. You also get a fortune cookie with a dirty fortune, and I hope they sort and screen these by age before they pass them out. Mine was scandalous and can't be repeated here!  TAO is located in \"The Venetian,\" which is like a Disneyland version of Venice, complete with canals and boats. Sort of cheesey, tbh.  *** = I use \"cultural appropriation\" here even though I'm mostly against use of the term given the amount of cultural syncretism that has occurred when it comes to foodways.",

As most places are in Venetian it was very expensive but the quality wasn't the best. If you want a nice restaurant with delicious reviews you should probably go outside the casino.  I got the shabu shabu filet mignon cooked in a ginger scallion broth with wasabi dipping sauce and the udon noodles with vegetable. The shabu shabu filet mignon was really good, though I don't prefer my meat rare done they recommended cooking it in the broth for 3 - 5 minutes which made it way to well done. So I was able to cook it 30 seconds and it was the perfect texture and juiciness. I mixed the wasabi sauce with real wasabi and that made the sauce for the filet mignon even better. I enjoyed my main dish a decent amount and would give that a 4.5 / 5  I didn't like the udon there was way too much salt and too much sauce, the sauce literally drenched the udon noodles and vegetables. The udon tasted very typical and nothing great, I'd rate the udon a 2 star.  Even though the ambience was really great our service wasn't the best, the waitress didn't seem to respect us (maybe because we were young) and not give us great attention nor was she the most polite.  Went with 11 people and most of the people didn't enjoy their food because it was super expensive and the food was just average. If you want high-class food you'll want to try somewhere else.",

Everything I tasted was amazing I really can't tell you what I tasted because I was sort off buzz (I mean come on, it's Vegas) but when I went to the one in LA it brought back Vegas memories ahah. Ok I'm kidding, but trust, this place is delicious. Waiters were attentive, I mean they just kept bringing food out. I love the vibe and energy right after we were done we walked upstairs to get lit. Ooh the only thing is the bathrooms you can see the males washing their hands they can see us.. I mean a drunk one in Vegas showed me his dong under the mirror (hilarious smallest thing I've ever seen).  You gotta love Vegas !",

A bit pricey, but quite enjoyable nonetheless.   When you have a large group, as we did, I would advise getting a lot of plates to share. You can always get more of anything you love. We started with sushi and moved on to Squab Lettuce Wraps and Satay Chicken, all of which was very tasty. Personally, I love dim sum and I felt the Crispy Pork Bao Buns to be about my favorite dish of the night. The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was probably the most popular dish among the group. Tao also has several Wagyu beef offerings and I haven't found too much fault with any of them.  All in all, a great dinner in a great venue with plenty of ambiance. If the girls are having a good time, then I'm having a good time!",

I would recommend to get the crab cakes for appetizer. They are meaty and very tasty. The glazed miso cod is one of the best things on the menu. For side dishes you can never go wrong with the fried rice or the noodles. And for dessert, well you have to get the amazing fortune cookie. This is a giant fortune cookie with half chocolate and half cream! It's just delish!  If you are planning on visiting Tao you will be pleased with the food. However, the restaurant is not cheap. Well I guess you get for what you pay!",

    "text": "This was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  My girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  We were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  That was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and I'm sure that's nothing new.  Once we were seated, our waiter, I hate that I forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  The restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  Honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  Because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  Pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  Now, I don't know if I got my hopes too high up for Tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. Not great, but good.  I wasn't disappointed, but I guess I was expecting out-of-this World cuisine.    Honestly, the best things, were the Thai Crab Cakes and the Pork Potstickers.  Full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the crab cakes was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  That was my favorite.  Now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but I wasn't blown away.  If I had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon.  Cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of onion rings were a great match. A fun match.  I ordered the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  It's like there wasn't enough.  But the quality was top notch.  It was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  I mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  The fresh fruit with the chocolate, I mean it was literally a sweet ending.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!",

Although we had already been inside the establishment and had a meal there, to join the upstairs club we were instructed to exit the restaurant and enter again through a screening process that included a visual check of the contents my purse, a walk through a metal detector, and a check of my identification.  When I presented my government issued retired military ID the bouncer told me that it was not good enough, that the only military ID's they accepted were those with a chip on them.  This was rather insulting to any veteran, to be disrespected in such a manner  Is this the way we treat our veterans? The arrogance, ignorance, and lack of training and respect demonstrated by the bouncer at the door was shocking and I was reluctant to write about this but I suspect that if such behavior is not corrected other veterans may be subject to the same practice.  The bouncer was about 6 feet 2 comes across as really cocky and condescending and was the responsible for checking ID between 11 and 12pm.",

This place is an Asian-fusion restaurant, and the meal and environment is well worth the price.  I ordered my favorite dinner dish, filet mignon. I had this with fried onions, a side of white jasmine rice, and a redbull-vodka. The meal was delicious, and my buddies ordered some pretty good stuff as well (check the photos). We shared a plate of cauliflower, which was pan friend with a great combination of spices. The waitress and staff were friendly, efficient, and ensured an excellent experience.

Given we were a large group, the menu was determined in advance and afforded us an opportunity to sample a large number of dishes. Large being the operative word as the dishes came out rapid fire. Overall, everything was delicious and cooked perfectly, a feat given the large size of the party.  Stand out appetizers included the Spicy tuna on crispy rice, Bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings, Chinese 5 spiced beef short ribs, Chicken Yakitori and the mini lettuce cups with Bang bang chicken. I wasn't asfond of the Peking duck Mushu wraps or the mini vegetable egg rolls. Foe entrees, we had the roasted Thai buddha chicken, which I would highly recommend, and Mr. Wongs jumbo shrimp, which was flavorful but drowning in sauce. The Che'f selection of mixed vegetables tempura was good if you like friend food. I only tried the sweet potatoes and they were delicious. The Singapore Mei fun noodles and Buddha's harmonized vegetable feast were ho hum and I would not rush to order either one.  Dessert was outrageous and featured a giant plate with fresh fruit, a HUGE fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, donuts and egg rolls filled with dark chocolate which were to die for.  If you're in the mood fro Asian food in a clubbish atmosphere, Tao should fit the bill.",

She didn't tell me this before I ordered and after I asked about happy hour.and I wondered why since my martini looked comparable to the specialty drinks on the menu. Ordered a few apps , lobster wontons and spicy tuna sushi. Both very good. Drinks were fine. Bar not busy but bartender seemed preoccupied, socializing with her coworkers seemed to take precedence over being super attentive to bar patrons. She was not rude, she did her job at the bare minimum and that was it nothing above. I loved this place a year ago and I will go again based on that visit.",

    "text": "Two orders on their menu that I highly recommend. Order their Sea Bass and Chinese Sausage fried rice with egg. Their Sea Bass was so tasteful it literally melted in my mouth.  It was so good. Their Chinese Sausage fried rice reminded me of a province in Southern China where I spent some time called Taisan; where almost everyone eats this for breakfast.  It was surprisingly very close to being authentic and yet Asian fusion style. But, regardless what you order, everything is going to be flavorful. Their service was fantastic, and they are able to split your bill individually especially if you are traveling on business with a large group.  This is one place to dine in Las Vegas that is not to be missed!",

    "text": "Went with a group of ten. Half the table got the \"chef's selections\" and the other half ordered off the menu. The off the menu selections were great, the filet, the strip steak, and the chicken were all great. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the chicken came out flavorful and juicy.   The chefs selections came out in a bunch of small, family style portions, and featured everything from pad thai to fish skewers and edamame beans. Drinks were okay, the wines by the glass were good, and prices were more than fair for the offerings. Don't however, ask for anything off the menu. One person at the table ordered a grapefruit martini, and the waiter looked as though he had been hit in the head with a baseball bat, and ran off. What came to the table 20 minutes later was a glass of vodka with a splash of crappy grapefruit juice cocktail, it was horrid...Then showed up on the bill for $15+...  More things went awry when the bills were presented. The server dropped them off then disappeared for a half hour, with our table size he already got his built in gratuity so he seemed to not care anymore. We were billed 3 times for something we ordered once, and there were other things that got rang in more than once. The waiter conveniently attributed this to the \"chefs selections\" choice, and would do nothing to fix the bill. It ended up being $85+ per person for the chefs selections menu (those who ordered, requested to stay at the $50 price point, which the restaurant offered),  Overall, the food was good, the steaks were well worth the $35-$40, and the wines were worth the $10-$12 glass, other than that, it was a bit over done. I would go back for the steaks and wine, but would recommend against summoning yourself to the chefs menu, seems like a great way for the restaurant to pawn off whatever isn't selling on you while charging whatever they feel like.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I made reservations for my hubs bday here before a show in the hotel, and notified the staff we had right at an hour and were in a timeline....as we walked in. I also before the apps and drinks were ordered notified the server of the time constraint and she said we were going to be fine.   Our drink order was taken and within 15 min or so had the apps and sushi we asked for. It ALL went downhill from there. As we ordered apps we also ordered entrees. I timed and it took 45 to 50 mins to get med rare seared tuna and crispy orange chicken. These item normally shouldn't take that long to cook if there are no large parties. I've worked in food and beverage service ,so I know. Not once during this wait did our server walk by, apologize or offer excuses or even offer complementary items while we waited. I don't EVER expect a comp in a place this fancy...but money or not, they wasted my time.  Finally after the server came back by I grabbed her attention and demanded the manager.    With five minutes til show there was no way we would be able to scarf down, get the check and make it on time. The birthday dinner, and show were ruined. I ended up telling the mgr how this was a special event and that I had warned the server and hostess of our timeline and even asked if they could serve us in time or if we should come back. He offered a bottle of champagne and dessert. In tears I asked if I could just call him tomorrow if we ever decided to come back. He gave his card and apologized.    We made it to the show in the nick of time. Later the next day I called the mgr and asked if we could just have our same dinner again, to which he agreed. ***** edit, I paid the $150 tab from the night we ate there that night and still left a tip of 15%***although I DO not feel it was deserved, I will never stiff a server.  Turns out dinner was lovely, relaxed and delish. We did add the mandarin sizzle fried rice above the original order, but got the complementary bday fortune cookie to make up for the prior night. The Entire tab was comped. I tried asking the mgr to let me at least buy the rice so I could tip the new server but he declined and said he hoped in November we'd visit the Tao in NYC since we told him we were going. Great food all in all but if you have a special event or are on a timeline please tell the mgmt staff to avoid a ruined bday.",

We arrived for our 10:30 reservation at 10:40 (we had a 15 minute grace window on a contract with the restaurant and nightclub), but they made us wait 40 minutes for a table anyway.  I will say that the bartender was super friendly, which was nice considering we spent 40 minutes with her waiting for our reservation.  Dinner took 2.5 hours to complete and they KNEW we had a reservation at the nightclub afterward, which made that experience terrible too.  Just don't waste your time, too many other delicious, more caring restaurants in Vegas to bother with this place.",

I've been to the Tao night club before but I had no idea that there was a restaurant part.   The food at this place was on point...I had the coconut breaded shrimp and my fiance had the wasabi crusted filet mingon. We also had a variety of tempura foods for an appetizer and I also tried one of their signature drinks, the \"Tao-tini\"-delicious! The beverage was a little pricey ($15, about standard for Vegas I suppose), but it was very well made and rather strong! I would say it's worth the money. Other than the food, the atmosphere is good and the prices are decent...however, it was a little loud and hard to hear the person next to you but other than that, everything was great! We will definitely be hitting up this place again when we are back in town!",

For dinner we had the Tao lo mein, which was flavorful but a little salty, and we LOVED the sea bass, melted in your mouth! Highly recommend the sea bass for dinner. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax.   After dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. On Memorial Day weekend with dinner, ladies were free and guys were 1/2 off. Can't wait to do dinner and dancing at Tao again!",

    "text": "The Good: The restaurant was unimaginably beautiful.Food and service wise, I experienced everything TAO had to offer this past MDW '16. The service was stellar (although I had a glass of water spill on me -- accidents happen, I get it.). The server was informative and guided my group of guys through a good culinary experience.   Why Not Five Stars?: I had the Drunken Lobster Pad Thai and felt underwhelmed with the food.  The presentation was amazing and I can't complain about the large helping of lobster but it was watered-down. The level of spice was poor and had me thinking that I should of stated extra spicy.   Refer to Friend?: I would. However, one of the most important reasons of dining at TAO during MDW is the ability to enjoy the nightlife aspect of TAO right after dining (free and speedy access into the club section if each one of the party members orders an entree from the dinner menu). To my dismay, this dining benefit was not honored. To TAO's credit, DJ \"Bless Up, I'm Up To Something, I like that, We The Best EPIC, Cloth Alert, New Deal Alert\" Kaled was going to be hosting. It just would of been great if TAO explained the \"Dining First\" option would not be honored when I made reservations.",

I would definitely recommend a table but they are always pricey so if it's not in the budget just walk over early enough that you can stake out a spot bc it will get busy and crazy.

The music and crowd on a Friday night was obnoxious as hell.   The food is great and our server was helpful, BUT only eat here if you like dining in a nightclub.    Ridiculously loud, crowded and intense.   Not what I was hoping for.   I would only come back if it was lunchtime and the atmosphere was more serene.     I don't mind going to nightclubs, I'm a professional dancer and I love a good cocktail, people watching et al...   I just don't wanna eat in the middle of one where I can't have a conversation without yelling.      My dining companion had a splitting headache before we were done with our entree.   Expect to be seated a full half hour late at least, even if you have a reservation.",

I have been here a few times, and each time I have been pleasantly surprised with the amount of delicious food they have here.   Here are a few suggestions: *The halibut on a skewer. I don't even like cooked fish, but this was salty and so yummy! *Kobe beef tempura roll. Exactly how it sounds. Pair it with some great wasabi and soy sauce, and you get a bit of a carpaccio feel. *Pork potstickers. These potstickers melt in your MOUTH!!! *Pad Thai. Very tasty with a subtle hint of peanut.  TAO is a bit pricey, but they have a full bar and a great menu. The chefs are also very courteous about allergies and specific requests.   Go here! Your tastebuds will be dancing!",

Went here for our bachelorette's \"last supper.\" We made reservations for 15 ladies and we got to sit in a private room. (Everyone in your party has to be there in order to get seated.) The room overlooked the first floor next to the giant Buddha and had the option of closing the curtains.  We got 2 private waiters who were very attentive. They gave us the option of doing separate entrees or doing family style for a set price. Either way, we'd get free entry to their club. We chose the family style and just had the waiter create our menu. He asked us if anyone was allergic to anything, which I thought was nice of him. Everything we  had was delicious!  Had a great experience here! Left with a delightfully full stomach =)",

    "text": "Great atmosphere! My husband and I came here right after we landed in Vegas and arrived at our hotel (Venetian). Our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. The ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is upstairs which has a very different feel (you would never know though!).   Our food was excellent. My husband got the coconut shrimp, I got Chilean sea bass and we shared shrimp fried rice they were all very good. But the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. We love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. We're considering going back for just sushi. It was so fresh and tasty.   Lastly, if you eat at Tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! Overall great experience. Would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas.",

We couldnt get reservations until 10pm (on a Sat) 3 wks before we left, so make sure you're out in good time if you dont want to eat in the middle of the night.   We arrived at 10 and had to wait for 10-15mins before we were seated (large party of 12). The place has a really cool vibe and we all loved the decor. We ordered pretty much something from every section of the menu. I had the miso infused Sea bass and its def. up there with the best things I've ever had. I will go back to TAO next time im in Vegas just for that sea bass. Yum. I also had a pink geisha (if I remember the name right) and that was also delish!   The service was ok, a little slow (had to wait for check for a while), but other than that good. The food arrived pretty quick and we didnt have any complaint about the overall service experience.   At the end of the dinner we got our stamps to get into the nightclub for free and we didnt have to wait in line, which was nice.  Now the few negatives. The place is LOUD. Like night-club-loud and we could not talk at all during dinner, just because we couldn't hear anyone. I have tinnitus and had to pop in my earplugs during dinner, it was really bad. There are ALOT of stairs (you have to walk up and down stairs to get to the restaurant and club) which is kind of a pain, especially in heels after having drinks.lol. Other than that we had a great time and I would go back (but not to the nightclub, which we left after 30mins because it was crazy crowded and the music blew).",

Tao's wine list was superb.  I tried a blend, a cab, and a sauvignon blanc and they were all top notch.  The appetizers were also excellent.  Especially their \"special ahi roll\" which was ahi in some kind of crunchy outer shell that melted in my mouth and made me wish that I had ordered it alone for dinner.  Than me and my ahi could have had a \"special moment\" together. It was a food \"o.\"  BUt I can't give it higher than 3 stars because if you're going to drop $100 on dinner than the sea bass better be cooked right.  Mine was undercooked on the bottom and I was bummed to be sure because up to hitting the slimy undercooked part, I was really enjoying it.  The atmosphere is awesome...great music, cool interesting decor (a two story Buddha), and beautiful people.  WE left by 11 and it was a Monday so I guess we didn't see the nightclub but it's just as well....I'm an old fart mom.  :)",

It was not crowded as it usually gets. My husband and I sat upstairs and enjoyed our time there.

I made the earliest reservations possible but still had to wait 15 mins which was totally okay because while I was waiting I won $400 on some weird monkey slot machine nearby.  I told the Hostess what happened and handed her $20 as a celebratory tip which of course she reciprocated by seating me at a really nice table.  Besides referencing my fellow Yelper's feedback, I sometimes like to preview menus online before dining out so I have a couple of choices instead of randomly ordering.  Here are the choices I divulged in and all were REALLY delicious:  Lacquered Roast Pork   $12 Toro Fatty Tuna                $15 per piece Squab Lettuce Wraps     $15 Tempura Sweet Potato     $4  (Blurb from website) Specializing in Hong Kong Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisines, Chef Ralph Scamardella's creations include everything from Kobe beef to traditional Peking Duck, all prepared by master chefs from across Asia.

Just ask nicely. - Fri/7 Jun we arrived about 11:55 midnight and we just missed entering viewing the \"hotel guest\" line (my friends were staying at the Venetian).  Took us only about 20 minutes to get in thru the main line. - Fri/7 Jun it was $20/man, or $10/man with the club pass.  Sat/8 Jun it was $30/man, or $15/man with the club pass. - Tao club had a typical ratio, I'd say about 60% guys, 40% gals, and average age of 25 or so (whereas Lavo crowd skews older, average of age 30 or so).  Lots of \"happy 21st birthday\" shout outs by the club/DJ.  Fri wasn't too busy but Sat was really packed. - Bouncers, waitresses, bartenders were all cool.  I was ordering a couple of cocktails and the bartender accidentally threw away my beer sitting on the bar counter.  I told him, \"hey, that's my beer\" and he promptly replaced it.  - Cocktails are $13/ea.",

    "text": "So you want to get into the Tao Nightclub guaranteed without waiting in line for hours??  Have dinner here first !!  We were a party of five (bachelor party).  Three of us had the steak, another had the sea bass and i had the sword fish.  We also had the dragon roll, two servings of rice, dessert but no drinks.  The total came out to around $52 a head (remember we didn't buy drinks) but here's the best part...  After dinner, they will stamp your left wrist that says \"Line Pass\".  Once you get this stamp, go outside of the restaurant and show it to the guy at the front door.  He will then give you a stamp on your right wrist (Chinese character) that will \"get you in and out of the nightclub as much as you want all night long, no waiting in line\".  So really, you can pay cover charge of $30 and wait in line for hours and hours (the line went outside the casino) or you can have a nice dinner and be able to get in and out all night long and not wait in line for an extra $22.    And by the way, i was pleasantly surprised with their food!  It was actually very good.  At first they said it was a la carte, so i thought their entrees would be small but surpringly they were not.  Take our word coming from five grown men that by the end of dinner we were actually pretty full!  Dinner was very good but the ' in and out as much as you want, no waiting in line ' option was VERY much well worth it !!",

    "text": "Living in Las Vegas, Tao is by far my favorite restaurant on the strip. Francis Fox is one of the most personable and professional Assistant GM's I've every met and is one of the reasons why I dine here on a regular basis. The hostess greeted us with a smile and was so friendly. Tonight we had Alex as our server. He had a constant smile on his face, was extremely professional, described his recommendations (which we ordered) like none other before, and really enjoyed our evening. The food at Tao speaks for itself! The decor and music is absolutely perfect. I cannot speak enough wonderful things about this place and share with others in the entertainment and hotel industry just how amazing it is. My future clients will definitely be dined here to experience this one of a kind restaurant. Thank you so much to the team of individuals that continue to make this such a special place. WELL DONE!!",

The sea bass was wonderful. The sashimi plate had a great selection; the toro toro roll and the Chef roll were all delicious.  We sat at the sushi bar. Something we always enjoy, however, at Tao there was no interaction between the itamae (sushi chef) and the patrons which we found disappointing, especially because it seemed they had a lot of down time.   Because this is Vegas, people watching is always at its' best. There was another couple sitting at the sushi bar who clearly had a lot to drink, so that made for some entertaining conversation over dinner.   Overall, the food was good and the wait staff attentive; however, I would probably try somewhere else for sushi when we go back next year.",

    "text": "How do I say this, ok the food is mediocre at best. It's not terrible just average and not worth the hefty prices they charge for entrees. The best dish we had was the side of eggplant, it was really tasty and so much of it enough for 5 people.   The cocktails were good but overpriced as well.   The best thing I can say about Tao is the service they are very attentive which I'm sure isn't easy considering how dark and loud it is in there. What makes having dinner at Tao worth the money is you get your hand stamped and don't have to stand in the unbelievable line that is waiting to get in the hottest club in Vegas. Once we finished our dinner we went downstairs and out to get in the no-line, line we waited 5 minutes at the most. The club is insane and I'm glad we went to dinner so we could just walk right in.   Next time I go to Vegas if I want to go to the club again I would go for dinner first, I would definitely go early the crowd is unbelievable.   If your not planning on going to the club there are better Asian-Fusion restaurants so save your money.",

I went here with a group of people to celebrate and ended up with a bill of $910, paid with my CC and went on my way to explore other things in Vegas.  I come home from my trip to find a $1200+ bill and call TAO, get transferred a few times before I get a live person that will listen, she takes my info and promises to \"resolve\" the issue\" - no call back.  I take time out of work AGAIN to call and get the same maze of people before being put to accounting, there I leave a voice message, no reply to date.  I finally call AGAIN for the THIRD time in 4days only to get another person who has no clue where to transfer me, I ask for a manager, get a voice mailbox and no resolution.  Its unfortunate, the food was amazing, the dessert was perhaps one of the best in my travels all over the world, but a mistake like this and the lack of direction by an entire staff has pissed me off. I would have loved to come here again, but no apology, no fix on their end on a mistake I did not make, no followup.   Give me a break TAO, your not going to last long with a staff like this.",

The drinks were very strong and the atmosphere was great but those paled in comparison to the food. We shared the sausage Chinese fried rice and My wife had the coconut shrimp and I had the Chilean sea bass, it was a TON of food way more than we could finish and my sea bass literally fell apart in my mouth it was so tender. The coconut shrimp was very crunchy on the outside but cooked perfectly on the inside and everything had amazing flavor. Literally the only things I would change if I could is the price.... Even thou I obviously understand why it is as expensive as it is, and the fact that the restrooms don't say \"men's\" and \"women's\" or have any type of sign on them besides \"ying\" and \"yang\".. So if you don't know which is male or female you basically stand outside until someone walks out...(I noticed a large amount of people doing this at it made for some interesting conversation outside the restroom).",

We ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in Vegas on this trip.  Might as well go out with a bang right?   Anyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:  -Spicy tuna on crispy rice -Lobster wontons -Sea bass skewers -Toro sashimi -Salmon sashimi -Mini donuts for desert  The thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  The dining room is a scene AND it is enormous.  It is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  And given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  Tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty Asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right.",

    "text": "Tao is the best EVER. Having eaten at their downtown location in Manhattan, I was ecstatic to see that Vegas had a location as well. I had an incredible, delicious, mouth watering meal here, but who would really expect any less from Tao!?  My writing cannot possibly do the ambiance of this place justice. The vibe is dimly lit, serene, meditative, Buddhist style meets sexy, bold, modernism. The decor is absolutely incredible, and we loved overlooking the GIANT Buddha statue sitting on top of the coy fish pond. I could not get enough of how sexy and awe inspiring the decor was, hard to believe it is located within a resort. So, so, soooooo beautiful! Everything is trendy and Asian inspired.  The outstanding service goes beyond words. Every staff member from waiter, to hostess, to bus boy was beyond friendly, high energy, had big personality, helpful, and professional. Whoever trains the staff here needs to give lessons to every dining establishment in the country.Tao does it right. The ambiance and price makes you feel like you're somewhere exclusive, but the service lets you know without a doubt that your service is appreciated. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Cannot say enough.   Now...the reason there's a collective pile of saliva under me....the food. We can never decide what to order at Tao, so we close our menus and make our waiter order for us, and they are always spot on. Ordered the lobster dumplings as an appetizer. SO flavorful, large dumplings with a delicious, full bodied sauce with mushrooms amazing. I couldn't even finish my share. For a meal we split the Peking duck for two. The closest I've ever had to an out of body experience. Holy _____. The crispiest, best, most tender, most juicy, most PERFECT DUCK I HAVE EVER HAD. We tried a new rice with Chinese sausage and a fried egg on top whipped together right at the table for you...amazing. Despite the full term food baby inside my stomach, and the hatred I had for myself for eating so much, I forged on and demanded that we try the fried bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sticks, and bananas foster sauce...biggest smile ever. Servers gave us awesome suggestions on things to do after dinner, but guess what I did? NAP! :)   I am so impressed with Tao and this location lived up to every expectation I had. My favorite restaurant ever!   **MAKE A RESERVATION!! WE MADE OURS A MONTH IN ADVANCE AND GOT THE BEST TABLE EVER, OVERLOOKING THE 1ST FLOOR AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COY POND**",

I ordered the curry noodles and they were salty and the noodles are way too thin, not to mention it was extremely over priced (along with pretty much everything on the menu) I mean c'mon 26$ for a little bowl of curry noodles?   Super dark and SUPER LOUD. It's pretty much like eating in a night club. You have to yell at the person across from you for conversation.   I went with a large party maybe 15 or so people. When the check came out we simply asked for it to be split up. The waiter literally looked at us as if we were asking him to juggle chainsaws on fire while unicycling on a tight rope.   He said it would take some time to split it up, pretty much trying to convince us not to. He took roughly 35-40 minutes to split the check. Seriously? C'mon. If the local Denny's can split a 15 person check with no issue why can't your hip modern upscale Asian restaurant do so too?   In conclusion, avoid Tao unless you enjoy mediocre over priced food and shitty customer service.",

From when we sat down to the very end of our meal, our server made sure our food was promptly served, and our drinks never ran out.  Service just isn't the same as before, but he definitely gave us a preview of how it used to be.  The food was spectacular from the sushi, to fried rice, pot stickers and special sauce, the salad, and I forgot the other food we had.    1.)  I was impressed with the sushi and could have had more if my tummy could hold it.   2.)  The salad is not something I've had before and that's what stuck to my mind after everything.  The dressing had a sweet and sour taste to it.  The sweet ginger gave it the zing it had.   3.)  Fried rice was good and had the right amount of sodium to it.  Most fried rice I've had have been very oily and can feel the oil reach my skin to create acne.  This wasn't like that.   4.)  Anyone can make pot stickers. 5.)  I forgot the other food we ordered.  I was happy and my tummy was too!",

A waitress took one straw, swirled the drink, put the straw IN HER MOUTH and TASTED IT, did not change the straw, and TOOK IT OUT TO SERVE!!! Hello Disease!  Now for the real review -   8:40pm 4/10/11 Showed up early on a Mon night for 9:15pm reservation, hostess said we were not on the list, very unprofessional. Was told to wait on the non-reservation line. Terrible.   9:40pm 4/10/11  Staff: Our Waiter was great, attentive but not overbearing Food:      Appetizers: DELICIOUS                Thai Crab Cakes with mango chili sauce - HOLY COW THIS WAS EXCELLENT! It may be REAL crabmeat!                Pork Potstickers with a chili sesame glaze - Pretty Darn Good!                Peking Duck Spring Roll with hoisin sauce - Not as good as the traditional Peking Duck Bun but it was pretty fun in a spring roll presentation.        Entrees: Eh                Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with tempura of onion rings                 - It was not crusted... the (yummy) \"crust\" was a tiny bit on TOP of the Filet Mignon. The onion rings were terrible. Battered with no spices. The steak was cooked perfectly but a bit on the salty side.                 Tao Shabu Shabu kobe beef cooked in a ginger scallion broth with wasabi dipping sauce                 - The 1 oz ($17) of Kobe Beef was 2-3 THIN slices of beef (2in x 1in). Broth tasted like soy. The sauce was all soy tasting too.",

It was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. The signature sea bass is why I usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck fried rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. The fried whole fish was pretty good, I ate everything from the tail to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. The duck rolls were bland and our lobster rolls were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. During this last dinner at Tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, miso soup and sea bass. The appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking.   Although I've had a good experience at Tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. Not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in Vegas right?",

The hot and sour soup with dumpling was amazing!  We shared many of the main dishes and they were all fantastic.  The dessert stole the show which was the fortune cookie.  A-MAZE-ING!  We'll be back for sure!!",

I went with the fixed price menu and had the salmon which was okay. Definitely had better for half the price.   I did REALLY like their filet mignon. We subbed out the wasabi that it comes with but it was a damn good filet mignon.   I know Tao nightclub is upstairs but DAMN it was loud in the restaurant and I'm one of those people who always tell others to relax when they say a place is too loud. It really was way too loud.   Fixed price menu is $55.   Honestly, it was only worth it so we could get stamped to get into the nightclub.",

    "text": "***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***  Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.  Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.  Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.  Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.  As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.  Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.  Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.",

What helpful guys...Wish I had half their amount of energy.  Now for the food... Tiny portions, not out-of-this-world good at all and wayy too high prices.  I know it's the Strip and they rip you off like crazy but the prices seem higher here than the NYC restaurant and the portions and quality are better at the NY restaurant.  None of the special rolls I would recommend-- all tasted like any I could get for 7 bucks at your local take-out joint.  The salmon with crispy onions - 16 bucks for a few pieces of salmon...Unreal.  Hardly filled up with 3 tiny dishes and some sake and 100 bucks later...Well, hey it's Vegas.",

Ok on to what we liked:  Ambiance: great- kinda loud so good for groups. Service: this was good too, I guess it will depend on your waiter. Food: we had the Kang Pao chicken, Shrimp Coconut, wasabi crusted filet mignon and the damn sea bass. (YES they push the Sea Bass to you)!!   Ok, yes portions are small, but everything is very tasty. So basically you are paying for the chefs making it. We paired it with a bottle of wine. Oh and the water. Careful here, it is 8 dollars for distiller water. Hahaha ..   After dinner we literally had to step out the restaurant to stand in a special line just to be directed to go back in. That's silly if you ask me. You will get stamped TWICE, that is silly too. At around 10pm when the club opens the crowd is not bad. However, this place gets ridiculous full of women. So men ... enjoy!",

There is re-entry and You get to go on a much faster line too) We were on time for our reservation. The hostess said we'll be seated in about 15 minutes, but we ended up waiting for 40+. Now I was super hungry and it was already like 11PM. If it wasn't for how pretty everything was inside and how nice the people were, I would've given them a lower rating. I had the miso salmon udon and it was delicious. I made it a habit to get uni every time I am at a japanese restaurant, and their's was really fresh. My boyfriend and I weren't a fan of his wasabi crusted steak, however. Service was excellent and the whole place is beautiful. Don't think I would eat here again, but definitely coming back for the party =)",

    "text": "If you haven't read, most clubs in Las Vegas are extremely hard to get into without paying a host. XS, Marquee are probably the hottest night clubs right now in Vegas but don't count out Tao. Once midnight hits and the patio is open Tao is shoulder to shoulder busy with people all over the place partying.  We all took advantage of the popularity of Tao nightclub by eating at Tao which provides expedited access to their night club.  My initial impressions of Tao was a restaurant trying to cash in on the Asian theme. When you walk into Tao and see how it opens up however, you're quickly reminded that a lot of thought had gone into designing the space. Lights are dim to set the mood which plays off the color scheme quite well. A giant Buddha statue sits in the middle of an open hall that spans two floors. Asian art is hung everywhere with bamboo vegetation. At the same time, it wasn't hokey, I really appreciated what they were trying to do here.  Onto the food itself, our parties ordered a large number of appetizers which were delectable. I suggest the sashimi platter which had bite-sized party-in-your-mouth morsels of deliciousness. My main meal was a deep sea dive scallops in basil curry. If you had a bowl of rice to this dish, it is such a full complete meal considering. The sauce was rich and the scallops itself were very large.  I would definitely recommend you explore other sea food dishes as my samplings of them were also quite rich.",

A bit more on the pricy side but you definitely get your moneys worth, portions are massive. We didn't finish half the food and I felt bad because it was so good. (My boyfriend also had said when he went to the bathroom they had a person who puts the soap on your hands and has different things you can have on them (perfume,mints,floss) I personally find this a bit too much for my liking but I didn't need the washroom so I had no complaints.",

The Peking Duck for two and sausage fried rice were delicious. The satay of Chilean sea bass is an absolute must.   Our server, Danny, was obviously very well trained and made great recommendations based on our preferences. Service was on point and not overbearing. One of the managers, Raul, came by and introduced himself and made sure everything was going well. These things don't take a lot of effort but make an experience so much better.   You don't expect a place like this to treat you like family because of the volume they do, but they really take pride in being hospitable. It's a trait most restaurants lack. Thanks Tao for the great experience.",

The $5 small side of brown rice seemed a bit unnecessary. Everyone else's food was well below average. Orange chicken would be better at Panda Express. Egg roll appetizers were dry and better frozen.   Ambiance---incredibly culturally insensitive AND inaccurate. Not sure who's idea it was to put a giant Buddha in a CLUB. But it was a bad one. The restaurant is also scattered with other decor from random unassociated eastern religions.   Overall would never be back and would never recommend!",

Dinner was comped thanks to our awesome promoter Thisoo, so the menu was pre-selected. Everything tasted incredible from the edamame to the dumplings to the fried rice.  We had 1 round of shots which were good(I think they were lemon drop) and 1 drink each. I got the tao-tini and I hated it, but that's personal preference! The drinks the other girls got were great.  Dessert was the giant fortune cookie with white and dark chocolate mousse inside and that was to die for. Not too sweet, and enough for all 6 of us.  Our servers were so friendly and accommodating! The only issue I had was that it was so loud inside, I couldn't hear my servers talking unless they were basically screaming in my ear. Overall a great experience and would def recommend :)",

We were greeted by a very friendly staff and quickly seated.   Since I both weren't too hungry due to going for dessert before hand at Serendipity, we just ordered the duck fried rice and chow mein noodles. They were both delicious and extremely filling. The ingredients were fresh and although the food was greasy, it didn't make me feel all disgusting like most restaurants. The rice was my favorite. Tons of duck meat and vegetables. The noodles weren't bad at all, but nothing too special.   Although the food was quite delicious, my favorite thing about Tao was the atmosphere. The Buddhist theme was present throughout the restaurant. There was a huge Buddha statue in the middle of the restaurant with other Buddhist statues along the walls and pillars. Even the table set up was awesome. I loved the entrance and the lighting.   When I return to Vegas, I will definitely come back here with much more of an appetite. The other dishes looked amazing as well.",

    "text": "The worst Asian fusion restaurant and also the most overrated and overpriced. Seriously the only reason why this restaurant still exists is because of tourists who eat here hoping to get a spot into the Tao club. Don't waste your money eating here. The decor is cool and over the top which is good for Vegas life but that's about it.   I ordered filet mignon mixed with Chinese broccoli and green peppers. Terrible. Super super salty drenched in heavy oyster sauce. And filet mignon didn't even taste like high quality beef- tasted like cheap beef from a Chinese restaurant for $ in your local area; And yet they're charging $$$ here. Truly a joke. Everything we ordered was so bad I refused to order anymore. Flavors are just off- either too salty, too greasy, too sweet or a combination of everything. The only things that were decent were the drinks and the large fortune cookie for dessert. And it seems like all the waiters come by for is to check if you want to order more food meaning spend more money, but we know better than that. It's just all for show and the glitz and glamour.   Bottom line is if you want better Asian cuisine, go eat at your local restaurants for $ or $$ and I'm certain it'll taste way better than this. But if you really want to go to the Tao club, go early but do yourself a favor and save your money for a decent meal somewhere else in Vegas.",

Lobster Wontons as a starter were very very good as were the Peking Duck Spring Rolls. Mr. Wongs Jumbo Shrimps w a Thai Basil Sweet Soy was delicious with 8 nice sized shrimps cooked perfectly. Our order ofMiso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with wok vegetables was cooked to perfection. Moist, tender and succulent nice portion of fish with a bit of crispy char on the edges and just enough glaze! The XO Long Beans made for a nice side. My friends ordered desert of which I had a bite and whatever it was was fantastic as well.  Tao was the highlight dining experience of my few days in LV",

We ordered the sashimi roll with edamame, which I figured would just be a standard roll, but the sashimi was so fresh and the crispy lining outside was a perfect blend of texture.  We also got the glazed salmon, which was very good and came with mushrooms that melted in your mouth.  The most memorable dish though was the Thai Buddha chicken, which is the best bite of food I've had in a long time.  The chicken was so tender and moist and the flavors all worked together without being overpowering.  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Tao did not not disappoint. The atmosphere was wonderful, but more importantly- the food was phenomenal. We ordered a bunch of appetizers so that we could have a taste of everything. The most memorable food items consisted of:  -The shishito peppers and mustard sauce. Amazing taste and not overly spicy.  -The chicken satay and peanut sauce. They were so good that we ordered a second plate.  -The veggie rolls. They were big and very filling. Definitely not a standard small egg roll that you find at a PF Chang's.  -The molten cake and salted caramel. The caramel ice cream definitely made this desert worth it.   The restaurant was also kind enough to bring out a huge fortune cookie dessert in honor of my birthday which was also amazing. It was filled with a chocolate and vanilla mousse.  In terms of the service, our server was extremely friendly and attentive. He helped us pick out our alcoholic beverages, which again were beyond our expectations.   Everything was great except the following:    1.) There was a man (possibly the manager or some wannabe security guard) who went around with a microphone/headpiece giving updates on table availability. He made us feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed. I understand that this restaurant is in high demand and busy. However, we felt like the experience wasn't enjoyable because we were being pushed out so another party could sit down. This gentleman AKA wannabe security guard approached our table and asked us how our food was, BUT he didn't do it in a way that made it sound like he actually cared about us or the food. He constantly kept hovering over our table and I found myself annoyed. Also, keep in mind that we were only at the restaurant for one hour.   2.) The bus boys kept sweeping up food remnants off the floor every five minutes (when honestly there was nothing to even clean up). It was excessive and made sitting down unpleasant. No offense, but when I'm eating, I really don't want someone sweeping next to me or even underneath me. If you want to get technical, those dust particles are traveling in the air each time you sweep. Therefore, they could have quite possibly made it onto our plate. From a sanitary perspective, wait until people leave the table.  On top of that, the bus boys kept clearing our table when we weren't even finished with our food.  At one point, we snapped at one of the guys as he was about to take our plate that we weren't finished with.   A word to management, stop having your guys go around rushing people to finish their food. I really liked the food, but quite frankly- the constant hovering, sweeping and clearing of the table made me not want to revisit this location. It shouldn't be about how many people you can cram into your restaurant. If we wanted fast food, we would have gone to McDonald's.",

As I was saying, the pad thai was phenomenal!  I added shrimp and there was literally tons of it.  I was actually surprised because some places can get stingy with the meat, even though they charge you for it!  We also ordered an exquisite dessert.  I highly recommend the large fortune cookie.

Wait staff are also very friendly and professional.    I started with the spicy tuna roll.  Tap makes the best I ever had.  Very fresh!  For the main course I had the Filet Mignon stir fry.  Great flavor!  Tao is always a great experience.  Only down side is it can get crowded so make reservations and it can be very noisy.",

Starting from the entrance, with the pools filled with rose petals and floating candle lamp in the center. They sat us down very quickly once we arrived, the attention from the waitress and staff was immediate, food came out and as I said before did not dissapoint. We had a few different dishes in order to be able to sample different items on the menu. From the crispy green beans, to the simply but always great warm edamame. For Entres we had the Chilean sea bass, the Wasabi crusted steak, the triple pork fried rice, vegetable fried rice and chicken pad Thai. I know some of the choices don't go together but everything we tasted was appealing to the palette.",

    "text": "TAO would not have been my first choice for an expensive meal.  Yes the decor is beautiful and original, I LOVED the huge Buddha statue, the gorgeous flower petals on the basins, the simple, chic and modern atmosphere, tables, wall art.  But this is where the good ends.  We were a big party of 10 with reservations on a bachlorette dinner. The first thing we noticed when we were sat down was how dark and cold it was. It was so dark no one could read the menu and so cold that 3 of us had to order soup to keep warm. Our server started off extremely pleasant, providing guidance on the menu, allergies, family styled nature of the restaurant, and specials. At the end they even did a big congratulations fortune cookie dessert.  The menu is typical Asian fusion, a bit too expensive IMO for Asian fusion. The plates were not big enough for \"family style\" specially between 10 people. My Chinese short rib plate had maybe 6 small pieces (definitely not enough to share!). Additionally, everything is a la carte so that $20 small short rib plate does not come with even a cup of white rice.  The food was very flavorful, sometimes too many overpowering and competing flavors. The ribs were drenched in what I think was a sauce... but it was too much for me. I heard similar complaints for those around me in my party.   It all went from bad to worse when I had to leave and asked the waiter for my check. All of a sudden he had an attitude with everyone at the table, repeating multiple times that \"even if [he] had to split it we would be still be responsible for the 20% gratuity\". He was extremely rude, acting as if we were going to not tip him (or tip him less) just because we wanted different checks. He also made a big deal about it taking so much longer to get the check. I am sure this can't be the first time that they have had celebrations were everyone pays their own checks (its 10 girls in their twenties... no one has $1k to pick up the tab).  Left a bad taste in my mouth, I could think of a lot of better places in Vegas if you want a nice expensive dinner.",

Similar to ambiance of Venice Italy that you experience at the Venetian canal, the Tao restaurant venue provides you an equally rich Asian feel environment (Buddha statue is a nice touch). It's a great venue to take business colleagues. If you are looking for a dish that just blows you away, try the Peking Duck that is served with rice wraps. It is simply amazing! You can't go wrong. The only thing preventing the 5 star is the high prices. It is a very expensive restaurant for what I'm considering simply as Chinese food.",

Just wanted to send my review in because I've enjoyed their food for so long and always thought the food was superior and never actually gave my honest review.  Keep it going guys!

I called twice to modify the reservations, and they never could find my original reservation.   It still worries me since I had to put a credit card hold, and they said it never existed.   Anyway, as we got down to the week before the event, I called to confirm and the third time must have been the charm as they had the reservation.  We were seated quickly.  The table was very tight for ten people. I understand packing it in, but this was a little much.     The server was helpful with what is gluten  friendly.  Gluten friendly items are marked on the menu, but there are many more options than what is listed so be sure to ask.      They also brought my sister a desert to celebrate her birthday. Overall, an affordable meal for the a fun group!",

Overal the place was great the only negatives were the drinks were not that strong, usually on  greygoose lemondrop I am good to go, but i had two of their tigerlillies and didn't seem like there was a lot of alcohol.. also we had a reservation and had to wait about 25 minutes, but was told wait a few minutes while they were setting our table. which probably was not the case.  overall i'd come back w/a girl's night out but for romantic date night, probably choose a quieter place  (also agree w/ the guy that mentioned the tap water request, they ask what type of \"bottle\" water you want and if you say no they say oh ok, so tap water is fine, instead of just saying water..)",

It's certainly expensive for what's on the plate, but you're also paying for the ambiance and the exclusivity -- this place is a hot ticket in Vegas. Last night I sampled the appetizer of steamed chicken potstickers (very tasty) and the fish hot pot main course, which was full of delicious shellfish in a lovely spicy broth that smacked of lemongrass, garlic, chili, etc. Sooo good. After finishing off the lobster, clams, scallops, shrimp and calamari that were floating around, I pretty much wanted to drink the bowl dry, the broth was that good. My date had the wasabi crusted filet mignon, which came with onion rings and a few greens. I tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. Our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested. Even the dessert (a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, a mochi sampler, and ice cream), was really tasty.",

I ordered Sushi and my husband ordered the Wasabi crusted filet and both were very good. Our server was awesome, he was so friendly and happy. We ordered lobster appetizers and each had wine. The atmosphere is nice, dim lighting with a giant Buddha and fish swimming in a pond around it. After dinner we got stamped for free admission to the club, we went in for a drink and stayed for about 30 minutes.

You enter into a large open dark area with lounge style seating. We got a nice private room that overlooked into the rest of the dining area. We had about 15 people in our party and spent over $1000 including tax and tip. So this was an expensive restaurant nonetheless. It was a different twist on modern i would say. I ordered the appetizer butter fish which was skewered on wood and came with virtually uncooked and earthy tasting fresh asparagus. The butterfish was cooked just right with the perfect sweet fish flavor. The sweet glaze on the butterfish was delish as well. I ordered a bowl of brown rice which they charged $5 for. I think they pride themselves in the presentations of their dishes. Their bathrooms are quite unique as you walk into the hallway and see these boy pictures and think taht you are going into a male bathroom and then you find two doors with each with a similar statue next to them, but no inscription as to which is male or female. Talk about Russian Rulet. I won't spoil it. I ended up waiting for someone to come out of one of them before i chose the right bathroom.",

UPDATE: I found a stream-of-consciousness blog post I wrote about Tao, so I am pasting it here:  The food- oh, the food! We ate at Tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous GORGEOUS zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between Bruce Lee and Richard Gere. Both Gene and I fell in love with him. We sat under a 30' high Buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. I had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'Buddha's harmonized vegetables for the minor gods', among other sumptuous dishes. The place is so incredibly beautiful, in that insanely huge budget kind of way. The entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. The walls are lined with Buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. Incredible. Not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. Each thing was more delicious than the next, and I don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing I might have ever eaten.",

    "text": "We had a short weekend trip to Vegas and decided to check out Tao since we were staying at the Venetian.  It was our first time going into Tao (we later also went to the nightclub), and we found the decor and ambiance to fitting, comfortable, and well-thought.  The four of us kept commenting on the Buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  Fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.  We ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  The scallops were amazingly tasty, and the peking duck rolls were beyond my expectations.  Our entrees were pad thai, a red curry chicken, a sea bass, and salmon over udon noodles.  All dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  Impressive.  Five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  Dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our Cirque du Soleil show.  At the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  I'll definitely be making another reservation the next time I'm in town.    Bonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  The stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge.",

I ordered a round of drink for some friends at another table, but one got drunk and they all left, so we have to drink them. I drank so much, I forgot to order the large fortune cookie for dessert. The drinks were ok to good. We got the Mango Tamarind Martini, Xi Gua Tini, Lychee Martini, TAO Love Potion #9, TAO-tini, and some Patron. Og, the Miso Sea Bass (appetizer or entree) was great. Miso fish usually is.",

No issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an Open Table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  We have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.  Food, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  My husband has had the Hot and Sour soup with Shrimp Toast, Jasmine Rice, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  He LOVED them all.  I have tried the Orange Chicken (before I was GF), the Jasmine Rice, the Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken, and the Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce.  If I could get this food from home, I would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!    We have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a VIP after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  The Club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in Vegas.  HINT:  To address the \"which is which\" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  One has boobs, and one has a penis.  This seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and I figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  Seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?",

From the minute you walk in, to the bar area, and the dining area it was perfect. Good music, you're almost guaranteed to spot celebs anytime (we were hanging out at the bar next to Robert Horry). Staff is nice and super quick, drinks are good too, if you plan on getting Sake bombs for the table, they have a really cool machine that places all the beer glasses and shot glasses on top, with a lever at the top and you push and all the shot glasses go down. The food is awesome, kinda pricey for what you're getting but you gotta pay the price if you're trying to be at all the \"it\" places.

Lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  This is drinking food.  If you must have sushi, top props to the spicy lobster roll with black tobiko, king crab California roll (made with real king crab), and the crispy soft shell crab roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  All are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.  Small plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled Chilean sea bass served with a satay sauce. Never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  The Thai crab cakes with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  Well balanced.  The spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice crackers, a great twist on the classic.  Outstanding.  Bold flavor, cool tuna, crispy rice cracker.  So much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  Finally the  kobe beef sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.  Do not pass on the Peking duck spring roll with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp spring roll with spicy pineapple sauce.  Big bold flavors.  Textual contrast at its best.  Finally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  The warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  Very different.  Very good.  Note:  Dining at Tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  The food is meant to be shared.    Special note:  For the guys, dining at Tao does not give you any special VIP privileges to enter the Tao nightclub later in the evening.  Ladies, work the magic.

We ordered the miso glazed salmon which was fine, the size of the fish was beyond my expectations (insert my mass production epiphany), spicy toro tartar on crispy rice.... a nice attempt at copying Koi's signature dish but fell short on the crispy rice, it was too thick so the crispyness did not stick together but fell all over my plate.... some Filet Mignon yaki udon dish that really made me miss Oh! Taisho's kimchi yakiudon but I digress.  It was a very bland dining experience.  The only good thing - we were able to receive comps to Tao Nightclub.",

    "text": "What can I say about Tao the restaurant...? Its trendy...its spendy...its a mad frenzy...and its probably the best spot to have \"dinnertainment\" (thats right Yelpers...I invent words!) in Vegas. The spectacle of the huge Buddha seemingly floating above the koi fish pool is unreal (makes you wonder how they got that big bastard in the building) and awe-inspiring. The lounge and bar are like a social scene all in itself. The multiple dining areas (downstairs, sushi bar, upstairs) all have their own vibe about them meaning you get a different experience everytime you dine there. The food...well its just goes without saying that its f&*^^in great. The sushi, the thai, the chinese...everything is as tasty as can be. And hell yes its expensive...but your in Vegas...so deal with it. You can to have fun, dine and party like a rockstar, so do it and enjoy. The service is absolutely top caliber and just adds even more to the experience. For a non-Vegas person, I eat here and party here everytime Im out there (I should be a spokesperson for the freakin place) and will continue to do so as long as its there. PS...Reservations definitely the way to go unless you have the Vegas Passport (know someone that works here).",

I gave them a 3 instead of a 4 because the food was just ok and despite being told ahead of time that we would get into the nightclub free if we dined there.  After the meal they said it was still half price for guys because it as a busy weekend.  There's not much you can do but was still a little upset that I told a table of 10 we'd get into a club for free only to be told differently after we ordered.  The waited did hook us up with a tasting menu for the table which for about $70 a person proved to be plenty of food with a wide variety of dishes to try.  The sea bass skewers were by far the best dish we had, all agreed.  The lobster pad Thai was good but the lobster was tougher than lobster should be.  I wish there was more sushi because that wasn't bad at all but all there cooked items were marginal.  I like the at,osphere but for the price there are much better options to choose from, especially if you still have to pay to get into the nightclub which was the restaurants best perk.",

    "text": "Tao just flat out lacks what makes a great restaurant.    Waiter = Davy  SERVICE - The WORSE part of Tao is their service.  It is very very obvious that their waiters want to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.  I understand that people need to make money & waiters want you to order more. Go ahead and make that money, But there has to be a balance that waiters don't cross or else it will be TOO obvious & the customer will give you a 10% tip of the slightly bigger check instead of the 20% they were planning to give if the guy acted like what he was suppose to be, a good waiter.   When we sat down, we were offered 2 choices of water, both of which they charge for.  The option of bottled water is normal for \"high class\" restaurants everywhere, but it's the a-hole way of wording & tone that pisses you off.  My group of 6 didn't care for the bottled water because we were all ordering cocktails & beers anyways.  So we said \"Just normal tab water is fine\".  A BIG frown on Davy's face, and raises his voice in a mocking tone & says \"In Las Vegas, no one will give you tab water.\"  HAHA, a big freakin joke or what?  Couple of us in the group comes to vegas about 5 times a yr for business with the company.  We've been to more than a few trendy restaurants in the 5 star properties.  We went to Shibuya at MGM just 2 nights before, we had a CHOICE of bottled or tab.   DECOR - If you've been to trendy restaurants in LA or NY, there is nothing special about this place.  Don't get pulled in by the hype that the promoters try to put onto the place.    FOOD - Onto the food selection, Davy tells us \"Its my job to explain the menu to you and I'll be HONEST with you, these are my favorites\" & proceeds to point out the 2 most expensive items on each section of the menu.  As he was doing that, we were just looking at each other like ... look at this clown.  We ordered what we wanted ourselves, again Davy's service starts getting worse.  All the food were very normal, nothing bad, nothing special.  CHECK - When we were done, Davy comes over & said \"You guys have to get desert, everybody's doing it\" What a pathetic half joke half pressure line.  We passed on it.  When he brings the check, we find that its more than what it was suppose to be.  On a closer look, he charged us for the price of entrees for 2 orders when we ordered appetizers.  Davy insisted that he gave us the entrees which we wouldn't know because the portions were all small.  Even if he did, it was his mistake when he took the order as we honestly all heard our friends order the appetizer.  Again, crooks.    There are PLENTY of nice trendy restaurant/club in Vegas, try any of those.  Don't be sucker & go because of the \"hype\" like we did.",

    "text": "Tao is one of my favorite restaurants ever!  Located inside the Venetian, this Asian Fusion restaurant is a must eat when you're at Vegas.  Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends, or you might not get the time you want or you'll have to wait awhile. The decor is very trendy Vegas, with dim lighting, lit red walls to contrast the dimness , Buddha statues, bathtubs filled w/ rose petals, and japanese lanterns.  Ambiance is very chic, modern, and sophisticated.   The food compliments the ambiance of the place, using traditional asian recipes and adding modern flair.  Here's what I had: Appetizers:  Spareribs- asian flavored spareribs were sweet, tasty, and the meat came right off the bone - there were 6 spareribs in one order Peking duck springrolls- fried spingrolls with peking duck inside was delicious and not covered in oil like other springrolls Entree: Miso glazed Chilean Sea bass -  my favorite place to get Chilean sea bass never disappoints American Kobe- my friend ordered this and he gave me a couple bites, and it was pretty good.  First time having Kobe beef so I wasn't too sure what to make of it.  Beware of $88 price tag. Dessert: Giant Fortune Cookie- Enough to feed 4 and served with fresh tropical fruit.  The fortune cookie was light and complemented well with the vanilla mouse inside the cookie.  I found the chocolate mousse to be a little too sweet. Service was efficient and friendly, so no problems there. I'll definitely come back to Tao every time I go back to Vegas.",

The service at this place is impeccable! Not only was our server completely attentive, but there was also a clean up person waiting on his toes. Did you ever play Roller Coaster Tycoon when you were younger? Well, if not- in the game there are custodial workers that you can pick up and move over to any mess you see so they can clean it up right away. This is pretty much what that guy was. I swear there must be some one overlooking the tables at all times so if any spills occured, they \"pick\" this guy up and drop him at our table with wash cloth in hand, ready to clean up. Oh and upon realizing that I had received the pad thai with chicken instead of shrimp, I informed our server who apologized and offered to get it replaced immediately. After declining, mere moments later someone in management stopped by to apologize and offered the correct dish for me to take home- free of charge. If we weren't going clubbing right after I would have gladly accepted because that would have made for some awesome drunken munchies.  That leads me to the next thing. The food was delicious. Everyone at my table loved their meal. Also the general ambiance of the restaurant was nice. We were sitting there talking about how it really doesn't get much better: good food, good company, good wine. What a meal! My only complaint is that it is a little bit dark and loud in there. Hard to hear/see people.  Oh! Side note.  Upon being seated, we informed our server that we wanted to go to Tao the nightclub afterwards (we had heard that they can help you get in for free). Someone was sent to our table near the end of the meal to help us out. Unfortunately they could only give us a \"line jump\" stamp but it didn't really matter since we were staying at the Venetian and were already on the guest list.",

Made reservations about 1045 pm. Arrived around 1030 pm. Waited no more then 20 mins, which wasn't bad. Seated upstairs overlooking most of the restaurant which was pretty bitchin. Nice and dim lighting, Asian writing on the ceilings. Music I gotta say was a bit loud. To the point where I had to yell my order out to the waiter. But nothing too bad. Had the filet mignon and noodles. Which was good. Brother had the sausage egg and noodles. Which to me sounds like a breakfast but he enjoyed it. My friend had the orange chicken. Which was very similar to panda express, no joke. Had some drinks and a bottle of cold sake. Yeah with tip and all. Still manage to keep the bill under $200. Which I have to say is damn good. Because at the end of our meal, we all got stamps to the club, with very little wait. All in all not bad. I might make another round here if I'm ever in Vegas.

I tried the Chilean sea bass, while the missus had the Wasabi encrusted steak.  The fish was very sweet, but pleasant and flavorful.  The meat was smoky and rich.  The preparation was excellent, but for the prices, I would have preferred larger portions.  It's very much a \"presentation\" meal, meaning that it's very pretty to look at, but that factor is likely factored in the overall meal cost.  The veggies were good as well, however.  The other factor of the restaurant is the restrooms.  \"What\", you say?  Hear me out.  They are not listed \"Men\" and \"Women\".  They are listed \"Yin\" and \"Yang\".  I stood there, having no idea what the Hell to do, until deductive logic forced me to go in the door next to the statue without breasts on it.  Considering the lack of women inside and resulting screams, I chose wisely.  (The correct door for us is \"Yang\", gentlemen.  And you're welcome.)  Seriously, I'm all for going against convention, but practical applications for practical purposes.  The inside is very nice, and gives a great ambiance. The servers were always ready to to proved respectable service, and the food was tasty, if a little smaller than my likings.  But not a bad experience overall.",

I wanted to go to the freaking noodle bar at the hotel because I was kinda grumpy but she insisted. There was this long wait for the night club upstairs but we told the hostess that we were there to eat but we got this weird look as if we were cutting the club line which I tried to ignore.  The main dude- kinda heavy set with a flat top says \"Hi, you guys got reservations?\"  That really pisses me off, calling my hot girlfriend a guy.  No...we didn't have reservations.  So...I take the little plastic buzzer and he says it will take 30-45 mins.  I decide to order some dranks as the bar.  When I go up for the second round at the bar for drinks, the chicka dees at the bar are all gawking at how cool my mustache is.  Two douchers walk up behind me, one has total respect for the stache and the other must have had too much to drink because he got in my bubble when I was trying to order my drinks.  The bar tender came by and he started talking and i grabbed that pencil neck and threw him over my shoulder behind me.  So....the wait for the table.  4 jack and cokes in....we get our table and I had to relieve myself.  I go to the bathroom and come to our table...very dark..very loud..trying to be patient because there is a night club upstairs.  So...I'm a little drunk and then our little too cool for school waiter comes up with the dumb a** blow out hair cut comes up and starts his spiel..saying what we \"Have to order\"  to go to the night club menue...bro...broham...we don't want to go to the night club.  We just want to eat.  So....I say right off the bat..Could we please get two waters?  He points to our table and says  \"There's two waters right there.\"  His tone, his attitude, etc. made me have a Viet Nam Flash back.  Like I said, the joint was dark and loud, I didn't see the two waters and plus I went to the bathroom.  Talk about wanting to chokeslam a doucher for attempting to embarrass me in front of my girlfriend.  This turd needed to be flushed down the drain.  I ordered a pretty extensive order and got up and left.  Bro....Broham...you're a waiter for a reason because you suck at life.  How ever if that's what you choose to do....have some common sense and learn how to take an order.  If I say two more waters, shut your stupid mouth and bring me two more waters.  You were lucky I was in a good mood.    So we finally end up going to the the noodle bar at the and it was the shizzzzzznitttt.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.  I love you.  And bring me my two waters next time.",

    "text": "Truly just OK.  I was here with two girlfriends and we came for dinner before hitting the nightclub. We had a reservation but had to sit at the bar for over 20 minutes before we were seated. The place was super loud (people and music) and when we were seated, we were barely an arms-length away from the next table over. Our server(s) - we had a few rotating in/out (maybe it was the switch over time?) - were pleasant but seemed rushed and stressed throughout the meal.   The food was mediocre and arrived overly quickly... We definitely felt rushed. We each had something different - variety of fish, meat and chicken - but each dish was overly salty and oily. The portions were fine but lacking flare and flavor. I also didn't like how we \"had\" to order main dishes in order to be able to access the nightclub. I was much more interested in ordering two appetizers but my evening plans got in the way!  The cocktails were fun and the wine list impressive. The bar at the front of the restaurant has a great atmosphere - I'd come back for drinks anytime.  I'd probably also come back for dinner because, after all, it's Vegas and you're here to have some fun in loud and busy places!   p.s. In case you didn't know: the entrance to the restaurant has bath tubs which have both rose petals and barely clothed women soaking in them! It's a surprise and a unique experience!",

    "text": "I went to Tao Asian Bistro on April 4, 2013 with my boyfriend for our romantic date in Vegas. I loved the atmosphere and decor. The music is loud and pumping through out the restaurant but it didn't bother me at all. It could bother some older people though but it set the tone for the ambiance of the place and I personally enjoyed it.  I suggest making a reservation to the place since it is pretty busy.  The wait for our table did not take too long. We were able to grab a drink at the bar right there located in the entrance and get our barrings and enjoy what this place had to offer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food..amazing. I had the chilean sea bass..OMG! So good..so worth it. Boyfriend had the kobe steak topped with onions, amazing as well! Dessert was terrific.  After dinner, if you wanted to go to the nightclub all you have to do is ask your waiter and a hostess will stamp your hand to get in to the club. You still have to go outside to check your i.d. but the wait in the line is minimal.   So, why the 3 star?  Well everything was GREAT except at the end of our meal when the waiter brought BACK our check to sign the total. I wasn't sure what that was about but pointed to my boyfriend to have him sign it because he was paying for it. Now, we are seated very close to the other people and the waiter yells out, \" Well when you tip me less than 10% you have to initial that's what you want.\"  People next to us were looking at us and my face just went flush! Then he walked away muttering something under his breath, I was trippin! My boyfriend had miscalculated the tip, not usually coming to a place like this and feeling a bit uncomfortable, he quickly signed the bill over and gave it to the waiter not realizing he miscalculated the tip.  Now, I understand..don't get me wrong. I was a bartender so tips are apart of your income and perhaps in a place like this, management may look at the waiters performance as a reason why his tip was so small, which clearly was not the case, he was great. But to embarrass us like that, really upset me and instead of going to the club later, we just decided to go home. So much for a romantic night. But you know, regardless of all that, I do know that Vegas thrives on money and on our way out I gave the waiter another tip because he was good, no doubt. IT was just a misunderstanding.  Again, I understand where the waiter was coming from but jeeze, maybe speak softer and don't walk away muttering things under your breathe making us feel like we were unwelcomed and like we did not belong. Because of this, regardless of the awesome food, we will not go back nor advise others to do so either because I believe it could have been handled better with less embarrassment for customers who spent over $200 for dinner.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at Tao and this was a far better experience than the first. We were seated promptly in a romantic booth on the far side of the restaurant near the gigantic Buddha on the first floor.  If there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of Tao, I would in an instant. (I'm a sucker for asian decor, but I digress.)  The service was phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) We had show reservations at NYNY and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.  My boyfriend had the hamachi (yellowtail) to start with. The fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. For an entree, he had the Hong Kong XO Shrimp with Long Beans and Jasmine Rice, which he loved.  Eating out for me has been pretty rough lately since I developed some weird food intolerances. There's very little in the way of flavorful food that I can have without giving me a terrible stomachache.   Since I'm not a fan of seafood, I decided to go with the Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumbers and a side of jasmine rice. These were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and I had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) If you like vegetables at all, you HAVE to get these. So full of flavor and healthy to boot! We joked at the end of the meal that we'd come back and just get four orders of these dumplings.",

Hey hey heeeeeey... Refused to be forgotten... Hey hey heeeeeey... *  When the waiter told me it's one of their more well-known dishes I was sold. Sure, they forgot about me and thought I was only eating a side of brown rice but when my sea bass came out oh boy did it find my lovin'. You can never go wrong with fattiest fish of the sea!  If I were to describe the party in my mouth it would be like P. Diddy's white party in the Hamptons with loads and loads of cocaine and orgies in every room. MY KIND of party.   The individual bowls of rice can definitely feed more than one person so save yourself a whopping $4 and share one with a friend. Also, when you dine here and purchase an entree you can ask for a stamp to get into the club that helps you bypass a loooooong ass line.  But enough with the tips! The take home point of this review is- ORDER THE SEA BASS. You will not be disappointed!",

Bamboo Steamed Chicken Gyoza, Thai Crab Cakes, Tofu Lettuce Wraps were all delicious! (The crab cakes were my favorite).   Then...the dessert. My GOD the dessert. So delicious. We received the Chef's Symphony of Sweets which included (I don't know the real names...) a giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla whipped cream, apple pie empanada-esque with vanilla ice cream, banana/chocolate eggrolls, mochi ice cream.

    "text": "I had heard so much about this place & was so excited because I absolutely LOVE Asian food. But I'm so sad to say, I felt like it was over-hyped & over-priced.  First of all, Tao is probably one of the most sought-after, hot restaurant/clubs on the Vegas Strip. The architecture and decor of the place is absolutely incredible! The beautiful Buddhas, the tubs with rose petals, the scent of incense and the gorgeous Asian artwork is completely the opposite of the uber-modern, loud, well-decked, expensive perfume- & cologne-doused, busy crowd that it attracts, especially on a Saturday night.  Our meal had its high points. A group of 7 of us plus 1 child were there to celebrate my Mom's b-day. We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day, but were told the only one they had available was after 11 p.m. Rather, they said try coming in & waiting for a table, which we took a chance on.  We waited for about 45 minutes in the bar area for a table on a Saturday night, which isn't bad at all. We ordered some drinks & a few appetizers off what I thought was an app menu while we waited.  But once we were seated, we got the same exact menu, which is kind of limited. There were enough options & our group had a lot of vegetarians, so everyone was happy.  I wasn't super hungry -- a horrible thing that happens to me when I travel! -- so I wanted to go with something somewhat light. I ordered the Pad Thai w/chicken, which was pricier than most neighborhood Thai restaurants at almost $19, so I had high expectations. Though it came in a really cool dish that was sort-of elevated, it tasted about the same as if I had paid $9 for it at a local spot. And it was completely SMOTHERED with tasteless bean sprouts. I don't mind a few, but I don't want a mouthful with every bite.  I wanted to order the shrimp tempura appetizer, too, but the waiter said you get 2 pieces for $8 which I didn't think was worth it!  The service was good, tho, and my family enjoyed their meals. My husband said the orange chicken was really good and he would have loved some more. The giant fortune cookie dessert with Happy Birthday all over the plate for my mom was a real treat!!  All in all, I'm glad I got to experience Tao, but I feel like I was slightly let down. That being said, given the chance, I would go back again & try the sushi. It looked fantastic!!",

    "text": "To give one star review it takes a lot. Well, Tao made it. It was the biggest disappointment in my life. I am not a critic, and I don't complain a lot. But this place earned both of them. Giving you a long story will be boring so I am giving you the facts. We spend only 3 days in Vegas, so we tried to make our restaurant \"visiting plan\" and make a list which restaurant we want to visit. Tao was on the list. So, the time has come and we showed up at the restaurant. The waiting was about 20 minutes. After we been escorted to a tiny table, around us a huge crowd of people with big parties. I am talking about party of 20 or more. So we asked a bottle water while we look at the menu, which came. But later it was constantly ruing with the bus boy by refilling our glass with top water, on the top of our bottled water.  We placed our order, drinks and food. The drinks came in about 10 minutes later, with some free appetizers. The table was so small we had to move al the things around and accidentally my wife's cocktail ended up on the floor.    She didn't even touched the drink.  The drink never been replaced or we have never been asked if we like to order an other one.  So after we been waiting like 25-30minutes total, one of the dish came. I was like okay, we gonna wait until we gonna get the other dish. After an other 10-15 minutes with empty glasses we decided to share one dish. The dish was nothing special and the portion was small no to mention it was not even our food. Or it was the food what we ordered nut the menu description was different. Well, on the perfect time just right after we finished one share dish, the other on came. Guess what, the same mistake. It was not we ordered, but very very similar. So after total spend almost 2 hours including waiting time, and shortened with $150 for the wrong dishes, and zero positive experience , I am writing this review and hope it will help people to choice  an other  restaurant where they want to spend their money and time.  I know it could be a lot of questioning elements, like why we did not tell the, busser or the  server what is happening, but like I said, there is more in the whole story, but I don't want to write a book.  I see there is a lot positive reviews about this place, and this is just my experience, but this review is honest, and not a \"payed customer.\"",

    "text": "Accepting the fact that everything on the strip is really expensive and unavoidable, Tao's got some pretty good food. It's a bit loud, but dimly lit and always packed with ppl.  4 stars because the Gyoza, chicken and dessert were tasty and would go back for it. Plus, lots of potentially good looking dishes I saw (fried rice, pad Thai, chicken skewers and more)  The food (ps the highlight was the cauliflower omg) - CHICKEN GYOZA (3.5 stars): choice of steamed or fried, wrongly opted for the steamed - mushy exterior but a tasty filling and soy dipping sauce. Served with pretty much raw bean sprouts. - CRISPY TUNA ROLL (2 stars): fresh fish, but overly heavy handed on the wasabi and ginger. Tasted a little too oily for me as well. Served on a bed of ton of edamame with grated ginger - CHILEAN SEABASS (3 stars): very flavorful, very fresh, served with veggies but a bit too buttery tasting for me. - ROASTED THAI CHICKEN (4 stars): a bit dry, but otherwise good.  - CAULIFLOWER (5 stars): imagine Kung pao chicken but cauliflower. Perfectly roasted, super firm yet cooked, doused in a delectable sweet and sour sauce. A bit sweet, but seriously could not stop eating this - FORTUNE COOKIE & MOUSSE (5 stars): didn't really taste like a fortune cookie, so much as like a vanilla crisp or something, but the killer part about this was the little bit of dark chocolate it's dipped in and the delicious both chocolate and vanilla mousse that it's served with. Also, it comes with fruit / so it's healthy right?  TLDR: based on price, good for business dinners or if you're okay with spending. Lots of good potential dishes, you just have to know what to order.",

The ambiance is really wonderful, and they do a pretty good job of making sure that the service received and the experience is not effected by the huge amount of people that they fit in the restaurant.  The Food: I have never gotten anything on the menu that I didn't like. The Orange Chicken is good, the Peking Duck Rolls are amazing, the Egg and Sausage Rice is amazing, and ALL the sushi is fantastic. The food is all so fresh and so unique that we can't help but come back every year. I can't speak much for the beverages, but I hear that their sake selection is pretty decent as well.   Go there to celebrate something! We have been for our anniversary two years in a row, and they don't give you a free slice of cake or bowl of ice cream, they provide a HUGE fortune cookie, filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, and topped with all kinds of fresh fruit. It is so very delicious. My only complaint is that I leave every time with a stomach ache because the food was so good, that I couldn't stop eating.   Go to TAO, it's worth the high price for the experience!",

    "text": "Tao was definitely a fun experience as so many people talk about it I felt like I had to go when I visited Vegas in March. The food was pretty good though I don't know that I would say it was memorable. I got a basic filet mignon lo mein dish. The fortune cookie dessert was the best part! It's a huge cookie at least 4 people can share and each person gets a fortune. Although two of us got the same fortune so oh well. Our table was on the second level which was nice as we were able to look out over the entire restaurant. The only other drawback I would mention is that's it's dim as heck in there. My interior photo had the flash on so it looks brighter than it actually is, but there were multiple tables using their phone flashlight to read the menu. I guess it's just part of the sultry ambience they are trying to create. I have to say my friends and I got somewhat dressed up to eat here as we read it was a \"dressy\" restaurant. Upon arrival I don't know that I would still say it's dressy as I saw people in sweats/jogging sweat suits others in jeans and sneakers or people in hoodies (not just young people either :\\). Did make me wonder why not try to look nice when dining at a nice restaurant but oh well I'm not reviewing the diners. Overall it was a good experience the staff is super friendly.",

In NYC it was presented in an egg shell; scrambled egg shell filled with the rice inside which made for great presentation as well as ample egg added to the dish.  Vegetable egg rolls were bleh.  Two of us split this appetizer that has 4 pieces and I barely ate one.  Something funky about the taste that I can't pinpoint.  Lastly, Kung Pao Chicken.  This came with too many veggies.  There was some kind of whole green onion or shallot, not sure what it was, along with lots of peppers.  White rice DOES NOT come with the dish, you had to order rice al la carte.  The server also told us this was the special and said it was $28 and when we got the bill it was $31.    I'm just not impressed and the prices are super high.  Loved the downtown NYC location but that was many years ago.",

Other than a few choice items we left the selection of the food up to Brandon who took us on a great culinary journey of appetizers, sushi/sashimi and entrees - all of which I would order again. Especially notable are the miso glazed sea bass, garlic green beans, toro tatake, very fresh sashimi, eel special roll, etc. Definitely looking forward to go back to try more from their comprehensive menu.

    "text": "Want the short of it? Don't, just don't...also CHECK YOUR BILL....want the whole story? Read on.   They call it \"vibe dining\" because they certainly can't call it FINE dining. Not sure what \"vibe\" they were going for with the Asian heavy theme & weird choice 90's rock playing for the dinner service.   Our story begins with a bubbly & gregarious hostess seating us and chatting about the menu. She informs us that the BEST way to dine is to do things \"tapas\" style and get lots of small plates. Well... we were here a couple days before for the New Years party and some of the small plate items were served. They were legit un edible. The salmon mousse was like salmon tooth paste! I forced myself to swallow it only because there was no place to spit it out. Any way.. seeing the same items on the menu I wasn't giving those things a second chance. At the time of the party I assumed it was because they went cheap for the New Years party & the actual food from the restaurant would be better. WRONG.   Any way the friendly women in front of us asks for our drink selections and we both decide on the reasonably priced $18 sake flight. She lights up & says \"Since you are both ordering one I will be sure to mix it up so you have a chance to taste even more of our sake and a couple higher end ones\" This was a statement and not a question. We thought she was being genuinely nice. WRONG. She charged for what we thought was a complimentary up grade making those $18 flights about $64 each.  Now the food. I ordered the Singapore Mei Fun Noodles with no chicken extra shrimp. Did this piss off the kitchen or something? Cause my first complaint is that the shrimp were not all devained and even worst many of the ones that were had the \"vain\" sticking to the side of it instead. Really not appetizing. I couldn't get man buns attention so I kept cleaning them off and tried to just move past it. I should have kept them to show .... oh well. Then I bite into an onion and it is completely RAW all the red onions in my dish were raw. I like onions but this was terrible to do in a dish like this. It said it came with a sauce, the noodles had flavor but it they were dry ... there was no \"sauce\" that I could really tell. Basically I have had better Asian noodle dishes at the mall food court.  My boyfriend had the Duck fried rice. He said the duck was dry it might as well have been poorly cooked chicken. There was way to much hard rice to be considered reasonable even for fried rice and the flavor was only remotely enjoyable for a few bites before it just overwhelmed.   We had been to the night club for New Years and one of the reasons we came back is I remembered them saying to show your ticket for 20% off of dinner so I ask about it and the waiter tells me has heard of no such thing but to his credit (the only credit he gets here) went to ask the manager. Turns out I was right but I missed the part about it being for New Years Day only. I felt it was completely reasonable to expect them to just honor it any way but they of course did not offer.   When we get our bill & my BF realizes the BS over charge he also noticed that we haven't seen the girl who sat us for the rest of our meal. She brought out the drinks and left. He was annoyed at this point but the attitude of the wait staff and not being able to confront the girl he decide it isn't worth the fight. We were there on vacation relaxing & he didn't want to ruin it further by getting all worked up so he let it go. To be honest, if I had been the one paying the bill, I would have said something. I didn't know about this part till later & was pretty mad because the whole meal was a disappointment (even the \"upgraded sake taste was bad. I didn't want blueberry crap for dinner and literally only one was good) and I would have spoken up.. I turned the other cheek on things like the raw onion just to keep the evening pleasant. Also, I don't think they care. I really don't think they gave a f*ck if we had nice meal. It is Vegas. Plenty of  new suckers. They don't NEED repeat customers.  Come here for the night life... maybe... not sure cause I paid for the special event... if the event says \"heavily passed hors d'oeuvres\" and you think GREAT I'll eat there! Don't count on it being something you WANT to eat. It was all so gross the waitresses serving were literally BEGGING people to take it. Not joking. They looked embarrassed having to serve it.  You would see them with the same 10 bites on their tray for like a half hour at a time because people would try ONE and never go back for another. You weren't fooling them twice. The Shrimp was like rubber and was being served cold but was warm... GROSS...",

I care more about the taste of my food.  And when you ask for water, they ask you if you want plain tap water or bottled water.  They almost make you feel like a schmuck for drinking ordinary tap water.  They serve Voss water in a big bottle here.  We got the usual sushi rolls and steak entree.  The food is okay, about what you expect from this kind of place.  The people are gorgeous so if you're into people watching, you'll probably like this place.  But otherwise, it's a one time experience for me.",

A large 3 story Buddha statue and DJ oversee a faux converted warehouse full of beautiful people.    The sashimi trio left much to be desired.  Though the wasabi salsa was delectable, the poor portion size made this dish way overpriced in comparison to other Japanese food venues.  Think deli thin sliced. A sampling of the vegetarian fried rice and Chicken Satay with peanut sauce saved Tao from total shame.    My suggestion? Eat before you get to the club and save your money for the drinks.",

Reservation was for 7pm but we arrived 10 minutes early and grabbed a cocktail at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. Ended up being seated closer to 7:30 which was fine because we were enjoying both our cocktails and the conversation at the bar.  As stated in an earlier review, we got the skinny waiter with glasses who looked like Dave Chapelle. In short he was an awesome waiter and made our experience that much better.  Had one member of our party who was a vegetarian and he went out of his way to explain all the vegetarian options available to her.  Had the Chilean Sea Bass and tofu lettuce wraps for apps and they were fantastic. The sea bass was definitely my favorite.  For my entree I went with the wasabi encrusted filet mignon with a side of giant onion rings. Cooked to perfection and an excellent choice.   Will definitely head back here on future Vegas visits.",

So we ask for a table, maybe wait for about 15 minutes, and get seated. the waiter was super nice, kept filling my water up (hurray! gotta hydrate!) and he was super patient with us as we took forever deciding what to order.  Ok, so this was actually like a month ago, so i dont remember the EXACT dish that we ordered, but I remember not liking the gyoza/dumplings. I was sooo disappointed because i had been craving for some, but it was not good. i forget why, but it just wasnt. maybe it was just bland, nothing special for however much it was.  i DO remember loving the fried rice with the fried egg on top, and their phad thai was really good.   You can also hear the music in the restaurant, i think it might have been different from the dance floor, but it was really good. hip hop music but it wasnt too loud where we had to shout across the table to talk to each other. just a great place overall.",

After three glasses of wine I honestly can't remember what appetizers we had but they were the bomb-ass rap song. If you don't believe me, ask L.A. Lakers Robert Horry - he was at the table next to us saying hells yeah... or maybe, \"As usual, I'll take the check.\" I wonder if he knew that the hot red head sitting next to him just came over to our table and advertised the strip club where she would be working later that night?  Our server Sereka was the cats meow. Not only could she handle 12 crazy men, but she helped us haze the groom. She hand picked a table of bachelorettes for us to send a comp bottle of champagne. Imagine the groom-to-be's surprise when 10 boa-clad bachelorettes came over and personally thanked him for the bubbly.  Oh, and definitely get the miso sea bass - delicious!  4.5 * stars",

    "text": "Friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular Tao Restaurant.  (It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!  We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.  The menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)  In the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:  Squab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.  Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.    Sashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.  Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?  Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.  Jasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.  Overall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)  Service is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!  At the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.    Tao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    There are better places where service is valued higher.  $185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks",

The hostess said the restaurant was closed and would not let me in to take a look.  It made no sense since I just wanted to look around the corner.  A very fashionable friend of mine went on a different day and was allowed to take a look in.  I don't know what is worse....I wasn't allowed to look at the restaurant because I was there when the hostess working was a bitch or because I wasn't fashionable looking enough.  I was in Las Vegas for the HR convention (15,000 people) and told my counterparts to avoid the restaurant if they expected good service.",

Come on guys, just cause we're Asian and all exotic or whatever doesn't mean we invite our spirits to the table for meals or like, pray or something while we go clubbing. I mean, wtf.   Well anyways, if you're able to get past the obvious whoring out of different Asian cultures, you'll find that the menu is made up of day-to-day plain-jane dishes dressed up and sold for 10 times its usual price. And it's not like they're so well-executed either. I'm talking fried beef udon and wonton... uhh, they sell better udon on the streets in Japan, and for a tenth of Tao's price.  Btw, our salad came with a fruit fly crawling in it. A LIVE INSECT. Our server was plenty horrified when we pointed the fly out to her, but God forbid she actually offer to give us comps for our lousy meal. She simply whisked the salad away and acted as if nothing's happened.  Minus one for the crappy, stingy service. Minus one for lumping three different, unique Asian cultures into one shitty themed restaurant. Minus one for charging sky-high prices for blah food. Minus one 'cause I just feel like it.",

She just had me fill out a very simple CC Auth and we were good to go.   Getting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. Once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of TAO hands down) you are golden!   And on to the food...   Started the meal with Pork or Chicken (sorry, I forget) Gyoza. It was good but CMON BABY, Gyoza is Gyoza. We also had the Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumber Salad. Both were so light and refreshing.   My entree was a wassabi crusted Fillet with Onion Rings and a side of Sake braised Shiitake Mushrooms. The Mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. I had when Shiitake's get mushy. The fillet came out a True medium rare and the Wassabi crust set it over the top. My spoiled ass even found a cab from Napa on the wine list. **Side note - don't you have being out of California and seeing whack wines on the menu?**   Too bad I didn't leave room for that Giant Fortune Cookie I keep hearing about.   After dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!",

    "text": "Dined here with my wife over a long weekend and to quickly summarize the experience, we both loved it...everything from the decor, the service, and of course, the meal was top notch.  We booked an early reservation around 5:30pm after being sold on reviews of both the original Tao in New York and this one.   TIP: Book reservations early since the choice times fill quickly on the weekends.   My first impressions of Tao's decor looks like money well spent...especially in the details. Upon entry, we noticed tubs filled with water and rose petals...to which my wife replied, Can we get in? I told her, sure ;) It also created an intoxicating scent...or perhaps that was the drinks?  Our table was nicely situated on the second level which overlooked the giant Buddah and coy fish pond. This was a great location since it was above the group tables noise and was quiet enough to have a decent conversation of sweet-nothings and what-nots. My wife also pointed out from this vantage point, you can see down some girls tops...I resisted to look as I felt I was being tested.  Our server, Michael, was tremendously helpful with our dining experience. His fantastic recommendations with the sashimi, the vegetarian selections, and the strong, yet fine Tao cocktails were spot on.  I also liked how the other staff members went the extra mile in making the dining experience special. Our water glasses were always full, and empty dishes were promptly removed. They also gave us a line pass for the nightclub upstairs. This was great in avoiding the long lines even as they opened at 10pm.  Another helpful TIP is the Yin/Yang signage on the restroom doors. Here's a helpful primer...  Yin = Feminine forces Yang = Masculine forces  Clever, huh?  This took my wife and I awhile to figure out, especially after a few drinks. They even included male and female statues...and the occasional male attendant peeping out from time to time...to help the confused or drunkards.  It is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. Overall, we enjoyed Tao so much and found ourselves craving the food the next day. I'm sure we'll be back.",

The food seemed tastier the first time around, nothing quite impressed like a year ago. Maybe Tao is getting a little old or my taste buds sharper, not quite sure. The filet is still yummy and dumplings were pretty good but everything else was okay. One must-try, their dessert doughnuts...definitely a win-win.

You may say,  Vegas as a twin sister of NY City, in terms of their party hours time.   In most clubs in this city, the 'happy time' is go on for twenty four seven!

Boasts an outside terrace with a strip views of Vegas!  I went and experience this 'hot spot' when I visit Las Vegas back in February 2006, that night, before and after I went to see and enjoy the Cirque du Soleil performance, Mystere!  Check out this hottie and experience it yourself! Experience a religious night at the Asian Tao Bistro in this Dazzling, Sparkle City, Las Vegas!  I am telling you!

    "text": "Great food in a loud, trendy spot. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. Drank champagne and wine, so can't speak to the cocktail list.   As for the food- we had the duck spring rolls, which honestly were average. Was fine, but wouldn't order again.  We had 2 pieces of toro served nigiri style? !  Then tried the tuna tartare over crispy rice, which was kinda like spicy tuna over a tater tot? Not sure how rice became like a tater tot, but it did! Quite good.  We had a sushi roll- I can't remember what it was called, but it had lobster, crab, and spicy tuna. This is the reason I'm docking a star- just not the greatest roll. In the future, I would probably stay away from rolls here...  All in all, I'd eat here again, and probably love it. The sushi roll was just a bit of a let down. Oh, and our fortune cookies were burned...  Perfect ending? Another two pieces of toro.... the best bites of the meal!",

Food overall very good, no real complaints on the food, I had the seared tuna, rolls, duck, wagyu, sake. Recommended for sure!  Located on the second floor of the venetian.",

Having said that... I'm judging this place on the food.   Chilean Seabass Skewers were amazing. Sea bass is always flaky and always good. Two skewers for $20.   Minced Pork Rice- $18 this had Pork belly slices served over rice. Very tasty. The portion was tiny. Was it good? Yes! Was it worth it? No.   Wasabi Crusted Steak $40- this was overdone. We wanted it rare and the server said medium but it came out well. The server never came back so we couldn't tell him. Ended up sending it back.   Curry Scallops- these were ok. The curry sauce is your standard sauce. Scallops weren't too big.   Just overall the price is not worth the food but it is worth the ambiance",

Not only was the food OUT OF THIS WORLD, but what was 10 million times better was our service. Literally THE best server I have ever had in my entire life was Jeffery. He was SO NICE, no on EVERYTHING, so helpful. We were all honestly in SHOCK of this guy because he was that good, and we had a huge party. None of us have had service like that in a LONG LONG time. HIGHLY recommend.",

As the sitting host  takes you to your table you will be enchanted by The Buddah siting in a lit temple of water within the resturant which is quite spectacular.   The service as always is great we orderd steamed Vegatble Dumplings along with fried Chicken Gyoza and King Crab California Roll which arrive at the table beautifully presented with Red Caviar and for our main course Filet Mignon Pepper Steak filled with asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots slightly glazed in a wonderful asian bistro sauce.   Tao is dramatically beautiful food is very delicious and as I said well presented I personally will take my guests to enjoy a wonderful dining experience here when they arrive out of town.",

Not only was the food exception the service was the best we have had on our trip. Amanda P our server took time to help us with the menu, made sure we found things we would like and even treated us to dessert as we were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary. It didn't stop with Amanda, every person who came to our table was very helpful and at the top of their game. It was great to learn about how everything is made on site, you could taste the freshness in the homemade lo mean noodles, the diver sea scallops were by far my favorite but my husband loved the spicy dragon roll!  Looking for an intimate setting with great food and great service Tao should be on your list!",

Keep in mind we did have reservations! It was so crowded we couldn't even walk or find a place to sit.

    "text": "I have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  This place is like a mediocre P.F. Chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  There are too many amazing restaurants in Vegas to waste your time here. Turn around and head out, do not pass Go and save your $200.  Seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  If you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came).   A group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the Venetian.  We made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.     Tao highlights the modern Asian fusion movement on their menu.  Unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by making them overly salty or overly sweet.  This makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad Chinese takeout.    We tried the Thai Crabcakes (WAY too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), Hot and Sour Soup (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), Crispy Pork Bao Buns (The pork was again WAY too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  Crispy Orange chicken (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as Chinese takeout), Kobe Ribeye (NO way this is real Kobe, despite assurances from our server. It was tough and hard to cut, we had real Kobe at Gordon Ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/sashimi rolls (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. We had better sushi at the buffet).   Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were certain elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the Orange Chicken, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  All in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. Their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.",

I ordered a pot of tea to split, dumplings to start, and since there were no longer any hot pot options on the menu, a small plate of the chilean sea bass.  One word for the sea bass: underwhelming. The rest was typical for a sit-down option of Asian food, however incredibly overpriced. Sent the seabass back  (it was very dry!) and ordered a sushi roll instead. The Angry Dragon roll was decent, have had better for much less money.  Service staff was on point. Absolutely no compliants on service, which is why they recieved a 2 star rating instead of a one.",

The only complaint I had was in the bathroom, you have to tip the lady/man for soap and a towel to dry your hands. But overall the environment was beautiful with the candles and tubs filled with rose petals. Food was fantastic and service was fast. Would recommend and will return when in the Vegas area (just remember to bring $ to the bathroom with you).",

The food here was no better than your average Pei Wei/PF Changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of vegetable rice is outrageous. We ordered scallops, Sea Bass $39, Orange chicken $28, and coconut shrimp for 4 of us. My husband and I had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. The Sea Bass and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. The scallops were large, there were 4. They were soaked in a curry sauce, which I did not care for. The service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f The bill was probably $230 including tip.  The worst of all was the noise level. There were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering upstairs to the nightclub at $60 a head. The noise, oh the noise! We had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  By the time we were done with dinner, I had a horrible headache.   If you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!",

For the first course, my friend ordered the Satay chicken with peanut sauce.  I got the \"crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with spicy mayonnaise.\" We both enjoyed our dishes.  We didn't try each others dishes because Paula doesn't eat sushi and satay chicken is just satay chicken.  I did try the peanut sauce and it was good.  For course two, Paula got the roasted Thai Buddha chicken with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  I got the filet mignon pepper steak with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and shishito peppers.  I did have some of the Buddha chicken and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.  For dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls  with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.  Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  The table was bussed quickly.  Our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at Tao.  The room is quite nice.  Dark and woody with a large Buddha in the center along one wall.  We got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  It would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.  I can only can fit in two places for this Restaurant Week, and I'm glad Tao was one of them!",

Bartender the bar was horrible...but bar tender in the restaurant was amazing. We spent enough to get into the club, which is a whole 'nother review on its own.",

The service was good, but the food was nothing overly special, and it was a bit pricey.   In my opinion, PF Changs, or a local Asian restaurant is just as good (if not better) and the price is WAY more reasonable. The portions are relatively small as as well. Again, the atmosphere is very cool, but the prices for what you get are not worth it in my opinion.",

A few cocktails that is recommend are the orchid and espresso martini.  Just ok cocktails were the bubbles and berries : orchid.  Try to get a seat on the upper level for a view of great Buddha.

I only wish the portion was a little larger but nonetheless I enjoyed every bite. After dinner they brought out a huge fortune cookie w/ ice-cream with fortunes for the whole table and sung happy birthday! it was so cute. I really enjoyed myself and the waiter was on point too.

The atmosphere is dimmed lighting and adorned walls of traditional Thai decor, who can forget the giant Buddha statue in the middle of the restaurant!? The decor is gorgeous, and the music is always on point.  Not ready to leave TAO? Head upstairs after dinner to their nightclub and enjoy a cocktail while listening to the hottest music being spun by their house DJ.",

Maybe it was the hype of everyone - family, friends, celebrities - that I thought my dinner at TAO was going to be a culinary experience. Honestly, I probably would have had a better meal at PF Chang's and spent a lot less for it. My appetizer (steamed dumplings) was bland and my noodle dish was so oily and greasy! I left feeling quite unsatisfied and quite queasy too.   Would I go TAO for the club and drinks? Sure - it's the Buddha that calls me.  Would I go for dinner at TAO again? Yes, but only if I was outnumbered in a large group and that's where everyone decided to go. Otherwise... probably not.",

He was probably 37, acting like he was 13 and a pube. He obviously hates his life. He didn't give our entire table menus, only a select few. And he gave us ONE drink list. When he asked us if there was anything else he could do for us, in a very fresh tone, I leaned in and told him to dial down the sass. Needless to say we were then approached by a waitress for a dual effort. The food was good but you have to order several plates to make you full. By the time it finally arrives at the table, good luck trying to remember what is what. It all looks and tastes relatively the same. One positive thing, the sushi was great. Management definitely relies on the fact that this place is considered trendy. I would pass, unless you hate the person you are with lol",

    "text": "For the past year I have been going to Tao regularly, once or twice a month for the Thursday night girls' dinner.  The food and drinks are excellent! But the last few times we went we had to wait like 30 minutes past our reservation time for a table.  I'm not sure if it's because priority is given to the paying customers, or if it's just turned into one of those places. I don't think I would stay if I had to wait 30+ minutes for a table plus pay a lot of $$ for food.    Since they give us a variety of appetizers and sushi each time, I have some favorites.  The stuffed shrimp and the chicken skewers are delicious! We get those almost every time. The dumplings are also decent.  And the sushi is always fresh. I never had rubbery fish there. The unagi is also really good. My favorite dessert are the won tons and ice cream.    Of course Tao is really trendy, loud and always crowded.  The restaurant is huge and most of the people are young and pretty.  Although most of the time you see a huge group of strippers.  We've always had good service even though the restaurant is busy.  And after dinner you can go upstairs to the club and dance it off!",

Even with the reservations, we were told that we could expect to wait about a half hour. When our buzzer rang 20 minutes later that maitre'd angrily told us that it had only been 20 minutes and that our signal had certainly not gone off or went off in error.  I hang with a pretty yuppie crowd back home and I'm typically prepared for dealing with the posh and pretentious crowd that frequents Tao and places like it. What I was not prepared for was dining in a night club with staff that was even more pretentious than its already pretentious clientele (and I fairly count myself amongst them).  Tone down the music and fire half the staff (our cocktail waitress was great), and I think Tao would be something special. As it stands, the maitre'd spoiled my dinner long before it had arrived.",

This is not a safe place for women and I want to warn people about this bathroom before you go because it was horrible and violating. I am calling management today to make a complaint and will be calling the police to notify them of what is clearly a violation of bathroom safety law. I also will be contacting my lawyer.",

The Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon ($40) with Tempura Onion Rings. This was great! A little fatty which I loved, perfectly cooked, and the crust was very flavorful but not overpowering. A good deal considering the prices of the other dishes! Go with the steak!!  Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck ($15). This was good! It had lots of flavor, and a slightly larger portion than I was expecting...but still a little spendy overall.  Lacquered Roast Pork ($13). This was a little chewy and the sauce was pretty thick. Can't touch the cheaper versions in Chinatown!  Pass  And to finish, the Dessert Platter. This thing was HUGE!! Enough food for the 10+ of us! We said our dinner here was for an anniversary, so this monster was gratis! There were some goodies there...nothing amazing, but all were good!   So again, if you come here...go with the STEAKS!

The menu was a little confused going from Chinese to Thai to Japanese with no cohesion. It just didn't make sense. We had duck spring rolls as an app. It was on par with a lower end restaurant and I suspect they were pre-made and frozen. For entrees, we had fried rice and a seafood dish. Neither were hot through to the center of the dishes. They were no better than going to a mall foodcourt. Even the tea was just warm despite asking for super hot water in the tea. Again, the waiter was very nice but this is not the place to go if you want really good food. For the prices paid, expected much higher quality. Asian menu trying to cover too many cuisines should have been a red flag.",

    "text": "I went to Tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  The last time I went I had some sort of a Groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  I think that's the only way I would dine here.  I think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town I'd rather go.  Maybe it's just me.  We started with two appetizers... the spicy tune tartare on crispy rice and the lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth.  We had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  We enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  The lobster wontons... well, they tasted like the best wontons I've ever eaten, but I could barely taste the lobster.  The flavor was drowned out from the broth, I thought.  For a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  Very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices of sashimi.  Granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a lobster roll of some sort, but for $58, I'd expect a little more.  Throw some salmon nigiri in there!  We also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  That was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as I think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  It also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.  Lastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  Very tasty.  We stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  We did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like Tao.  The service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in Vegas.  So 4 stars for me.",

The restaurant itself is pretty gaudy, huge statue in the middle, lots of Asian themed art. It can also be dark and loud if they have a DJ playing. But we've never had to wait more than a few minutes for our table and they have always been able to accommodate our large groups.  The food here is always surprisingly good and the prices are very reasonable for Vegas. We highly recommend the Crispy Thai Pork, the Short Ribs, and Sausage Fried Rice. You absolutely must get the Yuzu Sugar Donuts. 1 order per four people, or less. They are universally loved.   Drinks are pricey, but still cheaper than the club. So fill up here, then head upstairs and party with Busta Rhymes or whoever happens to be partying at Tao that night!",

But they give you 1 that is plain and 1 that is seasoned! yum! -Tuna Tataki: Fresh & perfect balance of heat! I just wish they would give you enough pieces to feed everyone.. I ended up having to go halvsies on my piece LOL -Dumplings: We got 1 green vegetarian option and 1 spicy pork option. The pork dumpling was definitely the winner!!!  -BBQ Pork: was nice and flavorful and didn't have an overbearing pork taste. -Shishito peppers: tossed with yuzu dressing = YUM -Triangle shaped eggrolls- Jason recommended that we wrap them in the butter lettuce they are served on.. Great suggestion!!!! -Fortune Cookie Cake: It wasn't exceptionally delicious but I love the cute fortunes that come with it!   Service was AMAZING!!!! Our server, Jason R, made the dinner very enjoyable and even showed us a magic trick at the end of dinner! Definitely request his section!   HOT TIP: Look for a promoter they usually have some free shot tickets to use at the bar ;]]] We were also supposed to get comped bottle service after dinner but as it turns out you can only get either dinner or bottle service & not both~",

Seafood was sort of lukewarm and not very flavorful. Just underwhelming all around.",

My BF raves about the sea bass but I thought it tasted like pancake syrup.  Whatever marinade/cooking prep they're using makes it WAY too sweet and destroys the delicate meat to where it's unrecognizable as sea bass.  Sea bass is such a light fish it needs a light preparation with no or very little marinade.  A little salt, pepper, lemon juice and garlic are all you need! For that much money I can think of a LOT of other places I'd rather eat. The service was great and the only reason they got two stars. The ambience and decor are very cheesy 80s too. But a lot of people I know love this place so give it a try and prove me wrong...",

    "text": "What a pretentious yet tasteful dungeon this was ! I got the feeling that the reason this place is so pricey besides the fact that it is in Vegas, and in the Venetian, is because they are still trying to profit and pay off whoever did their decor. It was unique, but I was not impressed because I see this stuff around all the time (hey, I AM from Los Angeles, the cultural enclave of the west coast). The decor is the highlight of eating here, not the food or the service. It is definitely no bargain. The selection of food is not sufficient. There is no description of the special rolls, which confused my companions and made me have to explain the differences to them -__-. The sushi was not well wrapped, or proportioned well. I did like the idea of a seaweed salad sampler plate for a measly $10, but the dipping sauce was bland and watery, and they just didn't go well together or alone. I'd rather go to a white box with windows for good food rather than try and fill my stomach through looking at cool things, but that is just me. I had a Love Potion #9 cocktail, and though it was good, it was a ripoff. Maybe I hit the bad bartender who gives too much ice and not enough of anything else, but it was a necessary gamble.  The service was fine, no complaints here. I actually ended up waiting less time than I thought I would have to. I also got the feeling that you have to be less than a size 6 to work at this place, including the men. Abercrombie/Fitch style lawsuit, anyone?  The music the DJ was spinning from ITUNES wasn't hip or amazing, it was just typical background music. I wouldn't dance to it, nope.  At least you can look around at other places you should have eaten after you eat here, since the Grand Canal shopping area is right here.",

I imagine the build out must have been underwritten by the casino as a draw.  A normal restaurant probably would not have the cash to finance such a spectacular place.  Statues of Buddha adorn a very upscale place...A tip on the bathroom, the woman's room is nearest to the statue with the naked breasts  So my first thought is great place/horrible food like a RainForest Cafe, but this place really delivers great food.  The menu is all things Asian.  I guess we call that Pan-Asian.  You can eat anything from sushi to Peking Duck and beyond.  We split the Chilean Sea Bass, dumplings and duck, which were all incredible...The service was on the ball as well  If you are going to Vegas, this is a place worthy of visiting",

    "text": "So we're in Vegas--my first time, and I'm luv-in' it!  We went to Tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose Board my husband sits on.  So dinner was not on our dime, I never looked at a menu with prices, so I can't comment on how pricey the place is.  I can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  It takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next  The next thing I noticed was the music being piped through the place--VERY hip!  Loud but in a good way.  A later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented DJ responsible for the tunes.    The drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including filet mignon, an UNBELEEEEVABLE Chilean sea bass with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, fried rice, and sauteed shiitake mushrooms.  Ummmm..HELLO!  After dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were TRIPPIN'!!  Next up was an assortment of desserts, including a Fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and I, why, we're lovers!!!  The service was absolutely and completely IM-PECC-ABLE.  There was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  My water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when I asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a Chardonnay and I politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable Pinot Grigio that hit the spot.    All in all, a fabulous experience, and one I wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!",

Basically, they know the place will be packed so if you don't want to deal with their bitchiness, they know someone else will gladly take your place.  I f-ing hate that attitude.  That said, I had the BEST veggie potstickers on the planet here. The kung pao tofu was amazing - and I'm the one who doesn't like tofu. But it was fried (like Mo Mong's tofu luc lac) and soooooo tasty.  I ordered a cappucino and it was horrific. Do not waste your money.   I will say that once we were seated (after getting the runaround upon our arrival), the wait staff was very good. I appreciated that, bc obviously they knew a fat tip was built into the check, but they were on top of things and I didn't sense any attitude.   Eating here is just one of those Vegas things that's nice to do at some point, if you find yourself in Vegas. And even though you swear you're not going to go to Vegas ever again, you do find yourself there. Again.",

The music was super loud. I suppose I was okay with that since I knew it turned into a nightclub afterwards. The actual nightclub is just located upstairs. The service was okay. I didn't mind since my beverage cup was never empty and my food came out in a timely manner.  We had ordered Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce, crispy spicy tuna roll, toro toro roll, an assortment of tempura, miso glazed chilean seabass, sand pot lobster/shrimp/scallops with black bean sauce, asian green stir fry and XO Chinese long beans. Everything we ordered was pretty much delicious. I certainly will be back to try other things on the menu.  I loved how after dinner, we were allowed to walk upstairs to the club without waiting in line or paying an entrance fee. We were stamped and set for the night. :)",

Luckily they give you a pager and there are some shops around to kill time. Plus theres a room full of couches to wait around on, and a small bar as well as cocktail waitresses that will be more than happy to bring you $700 bottles.   The food was pretty good. A lot of the \"fancy food I have no idea what this is\" type stuff on the menu. But if you're into the fancy stuff you'll like it.  Our waiter was super awesome. I expected some douche baggery at this place with the staff but everyone seemed pretty nice and even most of the security at the door were pretty nice guys. But back to the waiter, he hooked us up with drinks and was very helpful with menu questions. Unfortunately no \"group drink\" bowls for alcohol. Those are always fun and this would be the perfect place.   The theme here is pretty cool too. You've got the Buddhist stuff going on, it's very dark, and theres a giant statue on one wall. They've got loud music going the whole time, not like club loud, but you certainly can't have a quiet conversation.   Would I go back? Maybe. I don't regret going though. If you eat here you get free entrance to the club. Gotta get a stamp!",

Cocktails were very disappointing, especially at $15 each. It took them 25 minutes to get all of our food on the table, but since we were sharing, family-style, this didn't hold us up. By then, our waiter had handed us off to a busboy. We asked him where our waiter had gone, and he said the waiter \"was busy with other tables\". Apparently in another part of the restaurant, since we didn't see him again. He got his \"automatic tip\" for groups over ten, so he didn't care.

    "text": "NOTE: THIS PLACE IS QUITE ASIAN (food-wise)  This place is great. Fabulous.  Wonderful.  Not just the food, but also the service.  My girlfriends and I went to Vegas for Spring Break and decided to try out Tao.  There were 6 of us, and being poor college students, we did not want to splurge too much on the first day of vacay.  As such, we spent almost 20 minutes trying to decipher the menu and decide what to order -- I think our server came up to us at least 3 times in those 20 minutes.  Finally, we got over our shyness and asked him what he would recommend for us.  Our server was friendly, and directly asked our price range; we stated $30-$40 per person, at most.  He offered to put together a \"tasting menu\" JUST FOR US.  We were really grateful, and we immediately accepted the offer.    DISHES:  Most famous for their sea bass; our waiter ordered 3 appetizers of sea bass (2 sticks per order, so we each got one stick), a ravioli thing (I think?), and some other noodle and dumpling dishes.  When the food arrived, our server explained that he had given us a mix of the most popular dishes of their restaurant, and the dumplings and noodle things were just to \"fill us up.\"  Indeed, between the delicious food and omg-I-can't-get-over-the-sea-bass, we were extremely full by the end of dinner, and each person's bill averaged less than $30.   We were so happy with the food and service that we decided to tip more (I think we tipped like 25% lol).  So for my rating:   sea bass: 5/5; all other food: 4/5  service: 5/5",

Each table got a huge plate of delicious sea bass (among other dishes) and everything was gone at the end of the night. I realize its hard to screw up sea bass since it usually comes out shiny and melts in your mouth like a stick of butter, but w/e. It was awesome.  There is a decent amount of presentation involved as well, both in the setting and the actual dishes. I wish I had more details but the open bar slowly made the entire evening blurry and dark. Fun of course....but like...what happened again..? Go eat here, dont expect like 5 star restaurant experience but its fun.

The sushi  Is really good, just expect that it is very overpriced. Some sushi , drinks and edamame Will cost you  $ 200 easy .  Upstairs is a nightclub with great music younger crowd on Thursday's . And for the Life of me, I have no idea who designed their bathrooms. There are no signs in English or sensible diagrams articulating  man versus woman, You just kind of grab the handle and hope you make an accurate 50-50 guess..   During my third trip to the ladies room, I began chuckle  and actually enjoy hearing men accidentally stumble into the ladies room Lol  Soooo confusing.",

We got 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary. The food was awesome! I must say the wagyu beef stir fry was so soft. We ate everything including sashimi rolls. Kim chee fried rice was bomb! We also had a few drinks which had a lot of flavors   Located in The Venician hotel, self parking is free. The complimentary fortune cookie dessert hit the spot, I totally enjoyed the flavor of milk chocolate and white chocolate oozing out of the cookie. It also had 2 fortune messages which was cool!  We definitely be back",

The sea bass appetiser is amazing, my other favorite was the crunchy quinoa roll. A great thing about their sushi rolls are the substantial size and the fact that there's more filling than rice. Loud but not too loud on a full night. Make sure to make a reservation. We were fine making one early the day of on a Saturday.",

The Venetian was absolutely packed, as was TAO, so there was a constant stream of people walking by our table, which was situated near the entrance of the restaurant. Due to the volume of people, it was very loud and was difficult to carry on a conversation with colleagues, but we managed. Our service was also slow because our server was swamped. However, the food was very good. We shared a variety of appetizers, including edamame, spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice, steamed vegetable dumplings, and a few sushi rolls. All were very good. For my entree, I chose the miso glazed Chilean sea bass. This was delicious - so tender and buttery. We also shared the molten chocolate cake and seasonal fresh fruits for dessert, and both were scrumptious. I would like to try this restaurant again during a less busy time, but everything was enjoyable.",

However, my friend was in town for JCK so we decided to grab dinner there. We walked in at 5pm, no wait. We were greeted by the manager who asked if it was our first time dining with them, which it was. Told them I had been wanting to come here and he said I can assure you will keep coming back. Boy, was he right!! The place is beautiful but the service and food will keep you coming back! Everyone is extremely polite, not fake, and attentive. We are talking from the manager all the way to bus boy. Our server was Danielle who was a doll! She was super helpful with suggestions and her recommendations were on point. Another manager came by and greeted us later on and asked if we needed anything as well as during our meal. I decided to order from the kitchen so I ended up getting the Pad Thai with tofu and an order of the Avocado Tempura. Both dishes were 10 out of 10! The Tempura was amazing! Very unique, I had never this seen before. The Pad Thai had the perfect heat and was just right. My friend got Lo Mein with pork which was good as well. We also paired our dinner with a glass of sake. I'm not sure which one she had, but I had the cucumber one which was cold. It was crisp and delicious.  At the end, we were brought chocolate fortune cookies and \"shots\" of their signature drink which were on the house (I think it was the Taotini). Great way to finish the meal! You can come in here and drop a lot of money, or you can keep it simple. I will certainly be back soon, for my birthday next!",

Not a huge deal, but something to note.    Waiter was cantankerous and agitated that we didn't want to participate in their \"authentic asian meal\" of Prix Fixe dishes for the whole table. We ended up doing several dishes per person with a bill of $400+ and he still acted as if we weren't spending enough. Not pleasant.   The worst though, and why Tao gets 2 stars, is the aggressiveness of turning tables. Our bus boy tried taking EACH AND EVERY one of our plates before we were finished consuming the food. So bad as to TOUCH THE DAMN PLATE and us having to go \"dude, get your hands off of that I'm still eating it\".  Ruined the whole dining experience. They wouldn't check up on us while we ate to see if we wanted more drinks, food. Jarring.   Some of the food was well made and well seasoned. Most better than your typical asian joint, others the same quality just 3x the price.    The long and short is I wouldn't recommend the restaurant and I'm not sure I'd go again.",

There was a group of 11 of us, and I can't imagine not coming back with girlfriends. TAO is the celebration/party type restaurant and the vibe was perfect for us. It's dark and sexy, but you can definitely still read the menu without a flashlight.   I wasn't a fan of the lychee martini, so ordered the bubbles & berries to start and wasn't disappointed. I also didn't really care for any of the sushi we had, but when the hot food came out, holy F&$^, I was blown away. The lobster soup dumplings were to die for, in addition to the fried rice with Chinese sausage, and the sea bass. I was so full, I hardly got to enjoy the dessert.   Raul the manager came by to see if everything was okay, and ensured everyone was having a good time. The server assistants were constantly refilling the waters for us, and clearing the plates when needed. I cannot wait to come back!!",

Food was a bit salty but was nonetheless delicious. We also had as an appetizer some wontons that were in a gravy like sauce and I found myself just about licking the bowl. Truly tasty.

We had to wait to be seated and I was told it would be fifteen minutes, but actually only waited eight. Good start to the night already. The restaurant is beautiful and the lighting is simply amazing. The great art that surrounds the restaurant feeds the ambiance and tranquility. The vibe is so uplifting here and the music playing is very popular and upbeat from artist such as the Eurythmics just to name some we heard.   The food was incredible I ordered the vegetable egg rolls and the roasted shishisti peppers. The egg rolls were amazing there was hardly no grease which was so great. It was cut into fourths so was so easy to dip into the sweet and sour sauce. By the way the sweet and sour sauce has no after taste and is a perfect balance of the sweet and sour. The hot mustard was just that hot, so it was not for me! The veggies inside the egg rolls was so good, all were fresh too! I could actually see fresh mushrooms and can only rave about them. The peppers were hot and cooked to perfection. The dipping sauce that is accompanied with the peppers brings out the flavor of the peppers. While peppers are hot it was a half and half, some hot and some not. All were absolutely delicious.  The service was flawless, and if I could give more than five stars I would! The server was so observant to all my needs and questions as a guest. All of the encounters with the staff were perfect! I went to the bar and ordered my Rose wine and they had four bartenders working behind the counter and all were friendly and so professional. The staff here is trained to perfection and attends to all the needs of the guest. Our water cups were never left more than half full either. This is a quality standard I believe. I am so impressed with the TAO and this will be my go to when I need to fulfill my Asian craving!",

We had dinner at 7 pm and took our time and the club music was not an issue. The music in general could be a tad lower though as it did make it difficult to hear the servers. The service was good, we had a reservation in advance, we were seated after about a 10 minute wait, which we didn't mind since there was enough room on the couches in the lounge area and the decor is interesting to look at. I was offered more options once I talked to the server so you vegetarians/vegans out there, make sure you talk to your servers. The food tasted very good but are the prices high? Yes, but that's Vegas prices for you, nothing extra that this restaurant charges. Here are the items we ordered- - Vegetable potstickers - Kung Pao Tofu - Fried brown rice with vegetables and tofu - Sea bass  Wish we had room for the giant fortune cookie but we were so full that we skipped on this highly recommended dessert.  Tip: If you want free entry to the TAO night club then dine at the restaurant. They'll stamp your wrist and you can beat the lines and show up to the club.",

My husband and I wanted to go out and have a nice dinner one night we were in Vegas and everyone was telling us to try this place out...SO glad we did! We went with my parents and we all got different entrees (orange chicken, pad tai noodles, two different sushi rolls and fried rice. They were all excellent! The pad tai noodles were the best! It was my moms birthday so they brought us two desserts on the house. Doughnuts with three different sauces and a HUGE fortune cookie stuffed with different mousse's and fruit! It was delicious! The entire staff was so friendly! I really don't have any complaints on this restaurant. One thing...it is dark inside but it makes for a cool atmosphere. Will for sure be coming back!!",

    "text": "Compared to other places of similar food type where I ate in Vegas this place is far from the best, in fact I would say it is well below average.  The short line to get in around dinner time should have been a clue, but alas it was one that we missed.  This place looks fancy on the inside and does fill up relatively quick but most of the food is mediocre or just plain bad.  If you're thinking that it will share some thing like any other Asian restaurant think again, the food has too much salt, too much soy sauce, and is bland overall.  We had their pork buns here, think (Q-Bao buns) and they were burned on the bottom and raw on the inside.  The drinks were more watered down that I would expect for Vegas and poorly made.  I actually attempted to complain as given the decor of the establishment I thought they might do something about it, but I couldn't get the attention of anyone.  By the time someone stopped by I was ready for the check and done with dealing with it.  In case it wasn't clear, service was bad also, the waiters were busy and you shouldn't expect attention here.  We left after an hour and a half, having had a $100 meal with nothing but bad taste to show for it.  The place had filled up by then and there was a small line surprisingly.  That doesn't make it good, that just makes it convenient.  Take your time, the food court nearby will treat you better.",

On reaching there, our table was not ready which was the first major sign of how the night would go. We finally had a table at 10:50 pm. We proceeded to order a spicy coconut shrimp main and 2 sushi plates. The shrimp arrived atleast half an hour before the sushi did, so we had quite an uncomfortable wait for our sushi. This was not expected at Tao and the food really lacked any lustre.  The coconut shrimp was nothing to write home about but the sushi, well if it's an Asian bistro and you have specials as sushi, at least nail that. It was underwhelming to say the very least. Utterly disappointed with Tao.",

    "text": "meh...when it comes to asian food, i typically don't like to spend more than necessary.  reason being i can find better, cheaper and tastier versions in the San Gabriel valley. The reason i ate here was that one of my friends had their bachelor party dinner here.  i will have to give it props that, it was one of the cheaper venues to have a dinner party for 16 people.  other places i've called were roughly 150 a person, whereas TAO was going to charge us 95 bucks for a prefixed menu.  As for the prefixed menu, i believe we got: lobster wonton spicy thai dumpling soup curry beef samosas filet mignon pepper steak red curry scallops mixed vegetable tempura pad thai noodles chicken fried rice symphony of sweets.  the best item on the prefixed menu was the spicy thai dumplings soup.  i don't know what made it so tasty, but it was very soothing to drink.  the symphony of sweets was also cool.  they brought out a lot of different types of dessert, so its sure to please everyone at the table.  service was prompt. ambiance was very club like.  this place is loud and it'll be difficult to hold a conversation with someone sitting across the table.  another thing that i find kinda funny was that i remember getting to the bathroom was like a maze, or at least felt like one.",

We started off with tempura asparagus which was delicious! I had the pepper steak and my friend had the sausage fried rice. The asparagus was phenomenal with the sweet chili sauce and the pepper steak was so good! My friend also has some smoked salmon. Bill with tip came to about $100. Loved the atmosphere too. Michael was our server and he and his crew did a great job. We even had two managers stop to check on us. They invited us to the nightclub and would get us in for free too.   ***i must mention that i LOVED how allergy conscious they were. They asked if we had any allergies so i told them yes to seafood. Every time they brought a dish they let me know if i could eat it. For someone with food allergies this is amazing-I've never seen a wait staff be so attentive.",

I suggest the Tao-tini (delicious vodka cocktail) and their fresh fish items such as hand rolls, sushi and other fish specials. The rolls were to die for. I would definitely ask about the specials as well, we ordered items of the special menu and were very much impressed. The only thing to keep in mind is that most items on the menu are in basted in various sweet type sauces. There are not a lot of spicy, tangy or non-sweet options. I tried the chicken lollipops everyone suggested and liked them but they were very sweet so after two pieces, it just got way too much.",

I loved this place at one time and I'm sure I still do love the food but the hostess services was by far the worst I have ever encountered and due to this I walked about with my guest.   First off I was told 45 minutes to wait, great no problem because I love Tao ever time I come to Vegas I want it, but that turned into 2 hours plus. I approached the hostess asking how much loner after about an hour and she said another 20minutes. I said well should I of made a reservation and she said yes they are priority over you so I came on yelp and made one with an opening in 15minutes. I went back up and explained this to her as she rolled her eyes and gave me an attitude and said can we get seated now since it's been double the amount of time I was told and she said no I have to replace you on the list now. I was shocked. I've seen every single person before and after us get seated and still nothing. I even asked two other woman which my party had two if the reserved and they said no, and guess what they were sat before us. I didn't understand how we got missed so I said maybe something is wrong with our pager and nope it's blinking and perfectly fine. This was my best friends birthday in which I planned on showing her an amazing time and we sat there for over two hours for nothing. So it hit about 2 and half hours and I just couldn't anymore. I asked about and was told it's going to be awhile. I just sat my pager down and walked out. I could not believe it. How can you place a hostess that picks and chooses who she wants to sit. I have been a hostess so I have been there and for an even larger place and I know there is no excuse for our treatment. I loved this food and place until my last trip which was July 30th and I can promise that I will never go back. Horrible service.",

    "text": "Tao is a pretty good Asian restaurant. and club. and apparently like 5 things in one? anywho, let's start with the restaurant.  the inside looks really nice. giant Buddha statue, waterfalls...and half-naked sumo wrestler posters. that certainly was appetizing  the chicken potstickers were good, but $10 for 5? I guess that's Vegas pricing for you...and for my main meal, I had fried rice with duck, there was not as much meat in the dish as I would hope a $14 bowl of fried rice, although it was fairly tasty.  they have a lot of sake on the list, as well as house specialty drinks. I'm more of a beer guy, so I was pleased to see Kirin and Asahi on the list.  call ahead of time for reservations.  I'd go back next time I go to Vegas, but maybe go for lunch and see if it was cheaper. I was still kind of hungry after the meal.  here's a nice touch - if you go for dinner, you get a stamp to get into the nightclub without (a) waiting on the normal uber-long line [instead you wait on the slightly shorter long line] and (b) paying [not being a nightclub person, this was good].  perhaps I'm just jaded from living in NYC and having large amounts of Asian food available for cheap all around me.",

The lychee martini was nothing like the one I have tasted in New York I couldn't even drink it all. And the service here was awful. We felt as we were being rushed the whole time and we asked for more salt for the edamame and it never came. The food was very good but that's about it. The experience was not great, and dining out is not just about the food but the experience in general. Super disappointed.",

The Sushi was fresh (don't forget I'm from Colorado) & tasty. The Singapore Noodle could have had more bite but I like it hot. It was very $$$ but I think we would defiantly go back.",

There seems to be differences in opinion in the Yelp reviews whether dining at Tao gets you a free pass to get into the Tao Club. My understanding is that if you order an entree then you (males and females) get into the dance club for free. People also seem to have experienced differences in whether they have to leave the restaurant and then stand in a line to get back in, or if they are allowed to go straight in. On the night we were there (Friday), we had to go outside the restaurant and then stand in a somewhat short line to get back in.  A cool place to eat, but there are lots of great places to eat in Vegas, and this place wasn't good enough to make me want to go back.",

    "text": "Some of you people are ridiculous.  Let me point out a couple of things-  I saw someone who gave this restaurant 2 stars say that, \"I've never eating here, but I'm reviewing their service.\"  Then don't even bother posting your review- save us the time and save Yelp's bandwidth.  And to people complaining about the loud music. Why, did you bring your family there to celebrate your granddaughter's baptism?  Nice, real nice.  Oh, and stop comparing Asian restaurants to Panda Express- it's getting old.  First off, you can obviously tell that I love this place.  Let me tell you why.  Even during the first time I ate at Tao, I didn't expect it to be a quaint and gentle dinner made by a world-renowned chef.  Tao's advertisements have a naked woman with \"Always a happy ending\" tatooed to her back in Chinese.  Seriously, what did you expect?  If you think that kind of lewd advertisement says, \"Bob and Daisy's Kosher Garden Cafe,\" I'll fly myself to your city to slap you.  I came there and got what I expected and a bit more.  Stunning interior design by a NY firm whose design philosophy is heavily based on catering to the audience.  From the dramatic lighting, the 2-story buddha, and the naked girls in the bathtubs at the tunnel entrance- if you think you can take your grandma on her tennis-ball walker to this restaurant, you deserve a second slap.  As far as the food goes, it was fine.  Yes, I could've gotten better food at an off-strip restaurant, but was I there mainly to have the ultimate epicurean experience?  Absolutely not, I was there to eat, enjoy the energy of the restaurant and most importantly, to have fun with my friends.  What, you're gonna give a restaurant who serves amazing food 5 stars even when the food is served on paper plates and they're located in a rat-infested hole in the wall with horrible servers?  Don't be ridiculous.  As far as the service goes, I'll admit- it's not flawless.  They do know a lot about the menu and about Japanese and pan-Asian cuisine, and they're quite attentive.  But the hostesses could be a bit more polite.  You know why they're ticked off by the end of the night?  Imagine yourself as a tall blonde girl with 32C's, getting drunk calls at all hours of the night, getting hit on and gropped by the occasional stranger.. and hassled by the idiot who decided to bring their 3 year old child and needs a baby seat.  Of course, this is no excuse for the management to hire more enduring hostesses, but they don't care.  The money is coming, and they still remain as one of the most highest earning on the strip in terms of annual revenue.  Anyways, you've heard it all.  I love this place because it's a place I can enjoy inexpensive food (seriously, $12 pad thai isn't that much on the Vegas strip), amazing interior, decent service, with people I know who can enjoy it with me.  You want amazing food, go to Joel Robuchon.  But be prepared- I don't think Joel himself will come out to thank your granddaughter for eating at his place on her baptism day since obviously, that's what you expect of Tao.",

I am not a fan of raw meat, yet I tried it and it was unbelievably fresh.   The dessert plate included edible chopsticks and the fortune cookies had very interesting messages inside.

We ordered pad thai, gyoza, and a few other things. The server helped us decide, and took an active role in making sure we were taken care of, comfortable, and full. Granted, this was after the buffet at Island Sushi off the strip, so we weren't trying to eat too much, and the final bill reflected that: $20 per person, including tip. But we didn't order too much, and the server had it all just right. He also made sure that we had enough room in our stomachs left to be able to dance comfortably. He got us the line pass stamps to get into Tao, where we danced the night away (albeit a little uncomfortably, given how many people were crammed into that tiny room).  The decor is spot on. They did a fabulous job decorating this place, and it's all very classy and elegant, without it being over the top, like the rest of Vegas is.",

    "text": "Tao is one of those places that you feel is a must whenever you're in Vegas. In my opinion, it is one of those places that is a bit overrated.  My friends & I had reservations for 10PM at Tao about two Fridays ago to celebrate a friends birthday. When we first walked in we had to make a line in order to have our IDs checked. It was extremely crowded & noisy as we made our way up the line. Once inside we were given a beeper that would alert us when our table was ready. During that time we were waiting around & people kept rushing/pushing past us to get upstairs to the club.  Let me get to the service & food. After we were seated we had a friendly waiter who suggested a couple of the restaurant's signature dishes. I discretely told him the fact that it was my friend's birthday in order for them to bring out a cake or special dessert for her (which they did - a mousse filled fortune cookie). He was great and started stating some random facts about the club after I whispered in his ear so she wouldn't catch on. So kudos to that. Service all around was AMAZING.  The food was decent. Honestly, what stood out to me was the miso glazed sea bass. I could have ate that & that alone all night long. Everything else was okay from the noodles to the several appetizers we did try out. I can't remember everything we ordered exactly.  If you're trying to go to the nightclub & are in the mood to eat something before hand then you should come check it out for yourself. With the purchase of an entree you don't have to pay the cover charge for the club.  Will I be back? Not likely.",

And also like the New York Tao, featuring plenty of Asian Fusion that is severely overpriced and at times overrated.  Plenty of people tend to seek this place during all hours of the day, during various nights of the week.  Staff has been helpful but amusing in that on more than one occasion, our wait person was unable to pronounce properly some of the items on the menu and confused a Thai dish with an Indian one (curry, go figure.).  If you must go, make sure someone else pays your bill as my night special bok choy with seared tuna and duck spring rolls was a mere $31.50.  If that wasn't enough, in order to fill myself I ended up going to In-N-Out shortly afterward.",

Made reservations on OT 11:45pm, showed up at 11:50pm, and was not seated till 12:30am.  No biggie I guess, we just dranks a few cocktails and people watched at the bar.    The more attitude you give the people at the host's podium, the better they will treat you.    The prices of the specialty cocktails were $10-12.  I think that's a bargain in a luxury resort on the strip.  Bartenders were great, they were honest about the flavors of the drinks and warned us not to order certain ones.    Tried: Tao-tini, Saketini, Love Potion #9, Lychee Martini, Tiger Lily, & Orange Dragon.    Portions are pretty tiny here.  So be prepared to spend.    The yum: Onion Stuffed salmon sashimi-we ordered a SECOND round.   Crispy lobster & shrimp dumplings, light & full of crustaceans!!!  The aiight: Yellowtail sashimi w/jalapeno & ponzu, lacking in fresh flavor Spicy salmon roll, dull Assorted Nigiri  The ugh: Spicy Lobster roll w/shiso & black caviar, faux TOUGH lobster, ick!!!  End of the meal:  FREE chocolate flavored fortune cookies.  Preferential club treatment: Maybe mid-week.  They just give you a stamp, but you still have to stand in line outside AND pay the cover charge.  I say just stand at the foot of the stairs and wait until the bouncer is preoccupied and mosey on upstairs.",

The peanut sauce with the satay was great.  For my meal I had the filet with noodles.  The sauce was great.  I would have liked a little more meat, but I was still very happy with my meal.  For desert we shared the giant fortune cookie.  One half was filled with dark chocolate mouse.  The other half was filled white chocolate mouse.  Overall it was a very good meal.",

I'm not much of a fish eater, but the seabass was sooo goood. However,  I recommending getting two if you have a large group and doing family style. The portions here are fairly small, but the quality of the food is high.    Service gets five stars as well. The first time I came here, we sat upstairs- more secluded and private. The waitress came everytime my glass was half full and refilled my drink for me and asked if we needed anything else. The 2nd time we came here, it was extremely busy and we sat downstairs. Again, the service was GREAT! The waiter came back and filled up my water so much I told him to put the pitcher on the table :)   Heads up: I would hold off on the drinks unless you are drinking WINE with your dinner. We got a few signature cocktails and they were all average. Also, it kind of ruins the taste of the food.",

For a party of 9, we ordered a bunch of dishes - little bit of everything. The filet was pretty popular, and I really liked the pork as well. Their noodle dishes were pretty tasty too. I really had no complaint about any of the food we had.  It's a fancy place, so you won't get a huge amount of food per dish, but what you do get is quality stuff. The service was superb as well. Our waiter was very friendly and understood exactly what we needed, and knew what to ask and when.  On a side note, I found their restrooms a bit confusing. As some of the doors are left open, you cannot therefor see which is labeled men and women. And on top of that, they use 'Yin' and 'Yang' as labels for those instead. The first time I went I had to wait a second to see who was coming out of the bathrooms to tell which was the guys'!  All in all, can't beat this place for a nice, and fairly healthy, meal. Be prepared to wait for a table though, especially on popular nights for the club next door.",

    "text": "So who goes to eat at a night club and expects great tasting food and customer service? Not me, that's for sure. Well Tao (the restaurant) was a pleasant surprise. They were able to accommodate about 20-25 of us for dinner (though our reservations were for 11:30pm, but we made them at 4pm).  I would say majority of us ordered the sea bass and majority of us would say, it was damn good! We also ordered a family style dish of some fried rice and that was good too. I was amazed at how good the food was. Quality of the fish was excellent. My only gripe is the portion we all got. It's not a big portion. If you come here hungry, you won't leave full, I'll tell you that.   The service here is excellent, great staff brought everyone what they ordered, cups were never empty, the brought us everything we needed... all while being in the dark. I have no idea how they got everyone their order without being able to see, but they did... and the fish  (sea bass) was cooked to perfection.   WAIT... there's more! So we recently just found out that if you eat here you get entrance to the Tao night club too... without waiting! On top of all that, they gave us a free pass to Tao Beach the next day. What a deal! What would have cost us about 80 bucks (dinner, club entrance, beach entrance)... cost us the price of dinner.",

I wish portions were a little bigger though. I also tried the squab lettuce cups which I loved! They have a nice selection on their menu and also daily specials.  Price: Prices here are expensive. My dish was about $27 or so and my appetizer was around $15, I think. You're really paying for the atmosphere.  Service: Service is outstanding here. We dined here early but there were plenty of waiters taking care of us. They were all polite, well mannered and very on top of their stuff. Also you can make reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> but if you are planning on dining on a Friday or Saturday night...make them at least a month or so in advance!  Atmosphere: I loved it. We dined upstairs. Considering that we were here for an early dinner, it wasn't loud or anything. Very relaxing actually. I would love to see the night club next time. The entrance here is also beautiful. There are rose petal baths! I would love to come here to celebrate a birthday or something.  Location: Located right in the Venetian near the exit of the Venetian canal shops.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent, service was great, and the food was prepared quick. The day after we all went to the Bellagio Buffet which was more expensive than Tao and the food was nowhere near to Tao. Bellagio buffet was a waste of money.

For five bites a bit costly (17), but worth every penny! My only gripe with him would be that he didn't suggest the dinner portion knowing how good it was. One spicy tuna roll order later I was where I needed to be, but sad to know I would be leaving Vegas and not to eat this \"delish\" dish again.

This is where you tell the waiter how much you want to spend in sushi and the chef will come up with something to impress you.  I like the idea of challenging a chef to give his best rather than just fill an order.  I wish I could remember the two rolls that were exceptional, but will maybe update this review later.  The decor is amazing, decorated in classy asian theme with a giant buddha in the restauarant.  They could maybe get rid of the sumo wrestler photos.  The staff was attentive to our every need.

I want my house to look like the inside of this place! My drink was fantastic.  My friend ordered a tall greyhound and the waitress was nice enough to ask \"double tall or tall w/ more grapefruit juice?\"  No one has ever asked that before, so we gave her a big tip. The downside was that our drinks cost a lot of $$, however, the place itself and the friendly waitstaff made it that much better. We would definitely go again when/if we come back into town.",

Came on a Saturday night, so of course it was super loud and crowded. Good service, but we didn't have the same waiter twice. Is that weird? I thought it was weird. I would come here again when it's not a busy meal hour, and would be sure to be super hungry. Nothing's sadder than seeing a delicious coconut chicken curry being scooted off because you can't finish it. And don't even think about asking for the rest to go, lest you like public humiliation.  Spendier than some... there was 1 beer, a glass of wine, 1 potsticker appetizer, curry and pad thai, which ended up being a little more than $100. But eh, it's Vegas, what do you expect.",

And love all the asian style decor everywhere when you get inside. And the food was delicious! I got the Shrimp Pai Thai and it was so yummy and filling. Had to take half home. I'd definitely be back there again when i return to vegas! :)",

I have been to the one in NY and against my better judgement went to Tao in Las Vegas last week since some people I were with wanted to go there. The food while good was very OVERPRICED and frankly I have had better Asian food at a lot of places. The service is absolutely HORRIBLE. The hostess had an attitude and was not friendly, the waiter was like a robot and acted like he was doing us a favor by doing his job. Then during dinner I asked someone for water (who was not our server) and guess what he never came back. Asked a second time 5 minutes later and still no water. 10 minutes later my waiter appeared as we were done with dinner and has the nerve to say \"Is everything ok?\" Uhhh no.  Pointed out other server who did not help us to the manager and he said to us the server said \"Oh that's not my table I thought someone else would do it.\"   ARE YOU KIDDING?  F this place and everyone who works there",

We were trying to figure out where we could experience some fine dining, and we kept seeing signs for Tao at the Venetian. Right as we walked into the beautifully decorated walkway, I felt like I was stepping into a glamorous nightlife scene from a movie. There were floating rose petals on each side of the walkway lit by candles.   Of course, there was a wait, but it was expected. However, instead of just standing around trying to pass the time, we sat down at their lounge area where we were waited on by a cocktail waitress. We ordered a few drinks before dining while snacking on their complimentary wasabi peas, and before we knew it, our table was ready.  Their decor deeper into the restaurant was even more impressive than the front of house. Behind me was an open sushi bar across from a wall displaying artistic pipes featured inside multi-colored backgrounds. In front of me was an enormous statue of Buddha surrounded by more candles.  Our service was EXCELLENT. Since it was our first time there, our server really wanted to give us the full experience. He was very suggestive without being pushy, so it made our ordering much less difficult. The only thing that kind of threw us off, was when a new server took over without our being informed. The service, however, remained top-notch. They were anticipating our every need.  The pad-thai was good, the Shiitake mushroom tempura was delicious! Best tempura I've ever had. The desserts were creative and aesthetically pleasing. Definitely stop by if you want to make your trip to Vegas a memorable one.",

Our server was extremely friendly and even recommended drinks and food options.  I wish I remembered his name, so I could call him out.  But overall, great service.  Here is what I ordered: - Hot Edamame: Standard dish and was good to munch on as we waited for our food to arrive. - Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumbers: This was the best thing I had all night.  This is so good that even my non-vegetarian friends ended up my share, and I had to order another one.  I could have just ordered a bunch of these for my dinner.  Definitely order this for the table...its too good. - Pad Thai Noodles: This was disappointing.  It lacked flavor that Pad Thai usually has.  After eating the veggie dumplings, this was definitely a let down.  Overall, the food was mediocre, with the exception of the Veggie Dumplings that were amazing.",

She checked with a waitress who said no and put my order through.

Well here comes the Chilean sea bass, and let me tell you we both finished on that course. It was simply one of the most amazing meals I ever had in my life. The sea bass was definitely in my top dishes in my life, and I consider myself to of had some pretty damn fine meals. I wish we weren't in a rush to get somewhere, because we truly had to eat as fast as possible.   My only complaint is that I'm now seeing we could of gotten into the club upstairs with dinner purchase.. although we couldn't of stayed long, being able to check it out for even 5 minutes would of been worth it to add to our experience.

When we got there, they said we could wait 15 minutes for a large enough table for all of us (and we didn't have to pay $90 per person for the pre fix menu like they had initially wanted!) They poured us all drinks and this left plenty of time for photos with the Tao backdrop! The waiter recommended splitting the meals family style and though the portions weren't huge, we had plenty of food and the bill was actually not too badly priced!! Way less than I expected! They brought out a cool looking dessert as well!  The only thing I will say is the restaurant is dimly lit and the atmosphere isn't as night club/lively as I would have thought Tao restaurant would be. We got stamped so we could just walk up the stairs to the nightclub and had to get a second stamp which was kind of a pain but overall great way to get in without worrying about waiting in line.",

Chicken dish???: not sure which one, also didn't taste.  **DESSERT** We were treated to a giant platter of fruit, cakes, and TAO's giant fortune cookies.  Overall, a great experience.

For a cocktail I had \"Bubbles and berries\" which is served on the rocks with veuve yellow label, belvedere, St. Germain and strawberries!!!! It was a hit!!  We had a feast served family style!!!  Shishito pepper- a little spice, cooked and marinated!  Sushi - eel avocado roll and tuna roll were the best!  Edamame- nothing special.   Egg rolls- huge! Cut in half great for sharing!   Tofu lettuce wraps- tasty. Good even got those that do eat meat.   BBQ pork- not a fan. Not marinated enough... Just taste like pork with no flavor.   Chicken fried rice- light and tasty!   Giant fortune cookie- not the tastiest, but s great concept of fortune cookies for the table!  All in all... I would definitely come back!",

The Thai Chili crab cake were good too. One thing that I disliked was that the Busboys constantly cleared they table. They were not personable and they came to the the table constantly. I felt rushed and couldn't really enjoy my meal because they were trying to clear items before we were finished. It was not busy that night so I don't know why they were trying to turn over our table.",

Upon entrance if you made a booking through open table no one will greet you because the entrance to the night club is the same so as soon you get there you have to locate the person who's in charge of your dinner reservation and it's pretty dark . It's located on left side in the very dark unorganized corner .   The Buddha is beautiful set in the middle . Plenty of seating available in a Friday night . Loud music is being played since the setting is more lounge bar and the Tao night club is located upstairs not a dinner set up style .   SERVICE:  They are pretty fast and the girl who served us pretty nice and quick but so cheers for her! And they do stamp you here to get free entrance in the nightclub if you order any food in their main entree .   FOOD: *Pricy for what it is, well it's Vegas so expect it!  *Size of the service in sushi is pretty good  *Thai noodle with pork serving good for 2 person    Overall not worth it , better check other dining that deliver the best food rather than pretentious gimmicky place  . but if you wanna avoid paying for the ticket in the night club and eat here instead automatically they will give you free stamp ticket for you guys to get into the Tao night club   *the upstairs of Tao Asia bistro is the Tao nightclub *if you are guest in the Venetian which we are you can have free entree as well in the club",

My 2nd time eating here was nothing short of amazing. I hosted a bachelor party for my best friend with a group of 16. We didn't order one thing, I told the waiter to bring out his favorite dishes \"family\" style with big plates in the middle. Sake, drinks etc...EVERYTHING. 14 out of the 16 guys said this was the best meal of their life..Not just because of the amazing new twist they have perfected with Asain cuisine/french techniques, but the service was impeccable. They literally treat you like kings, My glass of sake, water or wine was never empty and I didn't lift a finger, I used about 18 forks, 13 spoons, and 12 knives just from my meal alone, and never had to ask to have it picked up or to have a new one. It was ridiculous in the best way. I've been to 5star  restaurants in London and Melbourne that don't treat you this well. Will definitely go back, but bring a large group and bring your wallet. lol",

It wasn't crowded bc we ate dinner at 5pm which is an ideal time. It probably gets crowded later on. The service was great and the food came very quickly. I got the miso soup as my first course and it was delicious. My mother got the lobster pot stickers I think, and they were great. The TAO martini is great (as told by my mother). I got the fried brown rice which was so good. It was a smaller portion which was great for me. The dessert was soooo good as well. I believe we got the sampler. The food was great and I had a great experience. Yes it's a little pricey, but that's bc it's a duplicate restaurant from the 2 in NYC. The attire can be nice casual. I wore heels and a nice dress and may have overdressed but who cares it's Vegas:)",

We celebrated my husband's birthday and had a group of 9. The restaurant was busy as is expected on a Saturday night but once we were seated, the staff treated us as if we were the only client in the restaurant which made the night special.   Daniel waited on our party and he was extremely kind and accommodating, especially with dietary needs/ allergies of one person in our party. Being our first time at Tao, I asked for suggestions and he was very knowledgeable on the menu. He made fantastic recommendations throughout the night. Amongst our favorites were the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice which combines the soft tuna with the crispy rice which work very well together; lobster wontons which had a welcomed complexity in flavor; and the miso glazed sea bass which was light, flaky, moist and so flavorful. I should also point out that the plates are family style portions for sharing which allows for interaction and great conversation. We had several dishes throughout our meal, wait staff were constantly removing empty plates, so our table never felt crowded or tight, our glasses were never low and they were there when we were ready for the next course.   Food was outstanding, presentation was memorable and the service, superb!  The GM, Matt was beyond attentive and came by several times to make sure everything was perfect. He was very friendly and charismatic and treated us like family. Nick also stopped by during the latter part of our dinner to check on us, introduce himself, and let us know that he would be escorting us to the club upstairs once dinner was over. Nick treated us like a longtime friend and escorted us to the club to finish off the night with a bang!   I definitely recommend Tao and I am already looking forward to our next visit! Thanks for making our celebration one for the books!",

Received a call the day before confirming my reservation for 8 (we had a party of 15) they then realized whoever booked the original reservation had booked us at 2 different tables.  I was told there was basically nothing they could do because the reservations manager was busy and I would get a call back from them later that day. I never received a call back.    I called them 3 times within the next 15 hours and it still wasn't figured out. They told me my only option was to come in at 4:30 pm (3.5 hours before our original reservation time) The hostess was very polite and I did apologize to her for having to deal with this situation because I knew it wasn't her fault, but how they were handling this situation was very disappointing.  Not only were the reservations made in far in advance, but we were all on one check and were going to do their tasting menu which makes it a lot easier on the kitchen staff.   In the end, they figured it out and pushed our tables together, but it took my family to reach out to 3 spectate contacts they had associated with the Venetian / Tao to receive my first call back from them 3 hours before our dinner reservation.  We all arrived at 8pm for an 8:15pm reservation and were seated around 9:05pm.   On a positive note: the food is awesome. Our entire table loved EVERYTHING they brought out.  Just beware if you have a large group :-/",

The lobster was delicious and surprisingly big. I had one piece of the tail and couldn't eat anymore so I asked the waiter to pack it to go. By the time I got to my hotel and checked my leftovers, only potatoes and one piece of lobster was in the plate. I have no idea what they did to the remainder of what was left but I paid for it, therefore nothing should have been missing. Real disappointment and it's hard for me to eat there again considering they showed me they are not trustworthy. When you're paying over $200 for two people to eat, they should have more respect for their customers!!!",

As I said in my other reviews of Vegas places, you don't come here to save money so don't get mad at the price.  We ate like kings and queens here. Pretty much had the entire menu as each person ordered a different appetizer and main dish. Very fancy, delicious and FAST considering the whole place was packed and busting at the seams. The kitchen and wait staff do great here.   Ended up paying $107 a person before tip. Totally worth it when in a big group because you try pretty much the entire menu and the price included 1 drink. I didn't need any more than 1 drink here anyway. No, not because they pour them so strong....because we pregame and I was all set, if you know what I mean. Hey, it's Vegas baby!!!",

The other reviews are correct, bring your cell phone or a flash light as it is difficult to read the menu and see the food as it's too dark. The service was good and the food was surprisingly delicious. The tuna tartare appetizer on the rice cake was amazing. I would highly recommend it. The lobster wontons were also good. It was family style so we got a lot of different entrees but the highlight was the fried rice. Overall, I'd recommend it but don't skip out on the tuna",

There wasn't much flavor to the entrees other than salt.  The dessert was better than the appetizers and entrees. However the presentation was a little odd. The fresh fruit came served over crushed ice and was very unappetizing once the ice started to melt.  Although the restaurant comped a few of our menu items, we still ended up paying 60 and 70 dollars respectively for a very poor quality meal. The atmosphere was nice but the food was definately not worth the price. I've had a better quality meal at panera bread for $15!",

Let's say this first: every restaurant in Vegas over-salts their food, because it's part of the bigger plan to drink your face off.  Knowing this, I can't really complain about how salty the food was (which it was), because that's just sort of the foundation that Vegas sets for you.  My coworker and I shared steamed dumplings, a sushi roll, and an order of the pad thai chicken.  ...it was all REALLY delicious.  I was honestly pretty shocked.  I come to Vegas about 4 times a year for work, and I've managed to eat at my fair share of restaurants on the Strip.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  We also got an excellent table in the back of the room, but I think that's because a coworker called ahead to her contact at Tao for us, since she'd done a reception there recently.  Not sure if that affected our service, but the waiter was very friendly and chatty.",

It would appear they are more concerned about making sure the restaurant is at capacity than customer experience.   We were seated around 9:35 PM. After complaining that this was unacceptable, the host picked up our first round of drinks.   Once seated, the noise level in the restaurant makes talking next to impossible. I felt myself yelling to communicate, which I am sure perpetuates into an even louder restaurant.   We had ordered a king crab roll. It was mediocre at best. I have had thicker crab meat at the buffet across the street. And for this price ($18 if I recall correctly), I am sure 50% of the price was paying for where I was eating.   The highlight of the meal was the dessert. We had the yazu trio donuts. They were delicious.   The lounge was nice. Ample seating space for you to lounge after eating. Drinks are the same price as you would expect on the strip in any top scale lounge/club.",

I had the Singapore mei fun, a standard noodle dish on thousands of menus. It was quite tasty, and the portion was substantial. Also, for Vegas, the prices were very reasonable.   I was actually surprised some dishes were in the $12-18 range. They obviously had some more expensive, seafood centric dishes, but that's certainly to be expected. They like to emphasize the family style dining here encouraging people to try multiple dishes. We had about 9 people at our table, and everyone enjoyed their dishes very much.   They are Asian fusion, which blew up 10 years ago, but good food is good food. Sometimes you handle the basics and let the trends fall where they may.",

WARNING -- if you are a dude, and plan on having dinner with several dudes (i.e. bachelor party) at Tao, don't count on getting line passes to get into the nightclub.  I went with three friends on Sat, 4/21, and after dropping $400 on dinner, we were informed by the HR manager looking hostess that we couldn't get line passes because we \"threw off the guy to girl ratio\" at the club. That's about the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life... way to take care of your customers! We might as well have eaten at some fast food joint and started waiting in line at 8pm with the other sunglasses wearing jackoffs that infest Vegas these days.

Schick, contemporary and fresh! - Extremely clean - Food is to die for! You cant go wrong! - Service is attentive and usually very professional, personal and upscale! - This place screams luxury!   What else can you ask in a restaurant?!  Just log into their website to see the style & design! It is defiantly one of the reasons I like visiting Vegas.  Cons: - Wait time to be seated can take a while - Seating at the less private tables can be annoying (too close to other people)  Those are the only things I can think of.  Few Tips: - As I mentioned, ask for a private table - you'll suffer at the small ones listening to strangers conversations  - A reservation is a must! This place is booked weeks ahead - Order at list 10 days prior! - If you did not make a reservation, act as if you did and it's their own fault for not updating the list, act mad, surprised and appealed.  Also, if you look like one, act as you are somebody important, celebrity or a hip hop talent. You might need to wait but you will be seated!  Price is expansive but you get what you pay for, and TAO provides a lot In terms of food, service quality and dining experience!  It also got the TAO night club which is awesome, to the best of my knowledge you could enter for free if you were dining that night. Club is open on weekends only.  Great for groups, dates, business & celebrations!  One of my favorite restaurants in the world!  Yalla Bye!",

Very good, perhaps slightly overpriced, (but barely) Asian fusion food.  Gorgeous, sexy decor and lighting.  I had dumplings to start both nights, and veggie pad thai the second night followed by a veggie sampler the second.  The sake braised mushrooms we had as a side dish were very rich on the second night.

I sort of knew what to expect so I wasn't surprised when the waiter brought out a cast iron pot and sterno can, but the meat was really exceptional.  The appetizers I sampled were decent and the waiter made a good sake suggestion for the table.  The ambiance in this place is set when you walk in through a short, arched hallway lined on each side with 5 stone bathtubs, each half-full with water and covered in floating rose pedals with a single candle in the middle.  The main dining room, dimly lit, is laid out around a towering (i mean 20-30 ft) Buddha.  If you can imagine, *from there* it gets a little cheesy.  The photographs on the walls range from sumo wrestlers to tibetan monks to little old chinese ladies and beyond.  The music was a little loud but they had a live drummer playing an amplified hand drum to the DJ's electronica.  It was actually decent music.",

It is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  Lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  This place is a scene.  But you know what?  The substance was actually there for the meal that I had.  We shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  The substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  A nice treat considering that I was expecting the worst.  For our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, XO Chinese long beans, the crispy spicy tuna roll, and the spicy eggland dish.  All of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  The dish that really stood out here was the crispy spicy tuna roll which ranks up there with one of the best rolls I've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.  For the main courses, we shared the chilean sea bass, the typhoon lobster, and the wasabi crusted filet mignon.  The main courses were all delicious.  The sea bass was fantastic as was the lobster.  It was all decadent and delicious.  I would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  Plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the Tao Nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  A nice bonus!",

Maybe if I was younger again and coudl deal with it - or if i was from somewhere where what they offer at Tao is \"new\" or \"interesting\".    The waiter was an A-HOLE big time.  Before we ordered he YELLED AT US that he REFUSED TO DELIVER ANY FOOD UNTIL THE MENUS WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE TABLE - basiclaly that means we can't get appetizers and order more later...Jerk?  Seriously?  Second of all, the food tastes like either Panda F**king Express (all noodle dishes) or it's completely covered in Sesame Oil.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVES me some sesame oil - but not when you can't taste what is is cooked with?  Finally, I think our bill was like $700, probably because we had 8 heavy drinkers there.  But it really felt like a rip - I paid $70 for drinks, one egg roll, and a bite of some Mall court noodles.   no thanks!

And the kobe beef appetizer -- which was one of the better items.  We ordered a couple more items to satisy our drunken appetites but I can't say all and all it was any good.  Really with all the hype around it, I expected something more, anything more than what we got and it wasn't cheap either.   I wouldn't go back with so many good dining destinations in Vegas, don't waste your time eating here -- maybe just hit up the club.",

    "text": "This Tao is one of the things that makes Vegas bearable for me. The decor (by my friend Thomas) is spectacular- the club part is just gorgeous- Buddhas everywhere (ok, a bit too much beaucoup de Buddha), Asian antiques, big stone tubs filled with floating rose petals- the sheer scale of the thing is amazing.  That said, of COURSE it is obnoxious. This is Vegas baby, and this place is very popular.  So, you'll need a res for sure, and even then you will wait, and the waitron will treat you as though you are an enthused tourist who just can't wait for that exotic experience. It's not quite as bad as \"Would you like some Sake? It's Japanese rice wine, and by the way, some of the fish here is raw\", but...almost. HOWEVER the sake selection is excellent and shows good taste in a sake sommelier ( a big career ambition of mine), the cocktails are strong, and the food is decent.   It is worth visiting just for the upstairs bathrooms, which are completely transparent until you lock the door- then they cloud up (a trick also used in the NYC Prada store, but they don't serve sake). An interesting psychological test.",

    "text": "I am quite positive that when the \"geniuses\" came together to plan Tao Restaurant and nightclub, they thought \"ya know, let's put a HUGE 20-foot Buddha in the place!  Everything's cooler with a 20-foot Buddha!!\"  Sad to say, they were right.  The original Tao opened in New York in 2000 to much applause and fanfare.  People streamed to the place like moths to a candle for the mundane pan-Asian menu, hip nightclub vibe, and that wild-ass 20-foot Buddha!  The geniuses came together again and said, \"Damn!  This worked so well!!  Let's do it again for the soul-less, culture-vapid city of Vegas!!\"  Well, lightning struck twice, and in 2005, Tao Las Vegas opened its doors to brainless celebs like Britney Spears, Tara Reid, and of course, Paris Hilton.  With the \"icons\" of our generation flocking to this mega power club, the lemming touristas followed blindly.  The masses consumed the wholly uninspired and overpriced food without blinking an eye.  They drank their cutsey sake-tinis and munched on the half-assed sushi bar under the watchful eye of the 20-foot Buddha.  They shook their bodies to the thumpity-thump electronic muzak like Massachusetts Shakers on Sunday mornings.  My visits to Tao (a requirement of the job) have led to some realizations.  Perhaps I'm too old and out of touch with what's hip nowadays.  Maybe I've entered the second phase of my life and have become a \"fuddy-duddy\".  Or maybe, just maybe, I'm immune to the brain-washing of the 20-foot Buddha.  **This would've been a 2-star review if I hadn't scored a pic with Tiffani Faison (of Top Chef season 1)  while visiting almost 2 years ago.  It was approximately 2 weeks before the Top Chef final and surprisingly, she was still serving food at Tao.  She was gracious and sweet.",

And when they mean fine they mean FINE! This place is awesome and also gets you front of line status if you want to go to Tao nightclub.  Since we had such a large party (8) we couldn't get a reservation until 1045. A little late for dinner....but its Vegas....I woke up at 5PM so it's not that late ;-)  We were seated and our server was very helpful in explaining the menu and the items on it and mentioning the special of the night.   So I had the 8oz wasabi encrusted filet mignon. BEST STEAK ever!!! I have eaten at most of the \"Fine\" steak houses in San Diego and one other steak house in Vegas but this one takes the cake. It was so tender and beautifully cooked (medium rare). My friends also had the special of the night (a 12oz Rib Eye) this was also very good and cooked perfectly. We also had the beef shabu shabu pot....it was good but I wish we could have tried the kobe beef...that would have been awesome. Either way I could have eaten the broth by itself. The other thing that stood out was the kobe beef carpaccio. EXCELLENT!! Marinated and cut exquisitely.  All in all the best restaurant I have eaten at so far in my 27 years.",

But for those not staying at the Venetian and want to go to Tao club afterward, dining there will get you a vip pass to skip the long lines.  Now the food part. The lobster wontons were AMAZING.  I know it sounds odd, but every bite was like a taste of lobster heaven.  The sauce concoction was just incredibly delicious. I also had curry chicken and sirloin steak (forgot the correct entree names), which were good but not great. I guess without the lobster wontons, I'd give Tao a 3 star.",

    "text": "If you stay at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, it's hard not to see all the ads for Tao. My boyfriend and I failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their \"Spiritual Dining\" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.  Tao is huge. And I love their asian-themed decor. But it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. They just get THAT much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. Our server Darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. There were LOTS to mention. Just like Sushi Roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.  It took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. Lesson learned! I started off my appetizers with an Orient Express cocktail ($13) with Kahlua and Vanilla Liqueur.  My bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (Japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well.   My main was Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). A vegetarian feast indeed. The dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but I wasn't expecting the amount of spice. Still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).  Tip: The restrooms say \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\" Yin is for the women and Yang is for the men.   Darren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. I could barely get any more food in my stomach so I wanted ice cream. And I got to choose 3 different scoops: White Chocolate & Yuzu, Cocunut, and Green Tea with almond cookies and even Pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. The thing is, I think the Yuzu (a Japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. I couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!  The Vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.  Tao Restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. You probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha fountain, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but I'm glad I dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other I've seen in any of my travels.",

    "text": "First off, let me say that you can get better food in other restaurants.  But when you are in Vegas, it's often more about the atmosphere and the experience.  Want a celebrity sighting?  Want to visit a Vegas hotspot?  Tao is definitely a great choice at the moment in the fickle and ever-changing Vegas scene.  The food takes a number of dishes from Southeast Asia and moderates the taste for a Western palate.  Spices are generally mild, the ingredients are less exotic, and anyone who has eaten at a P.F. Chang's will feel very comfortable.  You really can't go wrong if you choose a number of small plates and share them family-style.  I'd also highly recommend the sake flights, which give you a sampling for some very fine wines.  Oddly enough, you can't tell which is which, but does it really matter?  This is a great location for those large groups, although getting a reservation can be difficult.  It's a good thing that they have late-night seating up to 10:30 or 11:00pm.  A note for those bachelor/ette parties - eating dinner at the restaurant does NOT get you into the club automatically, so plan accordingly.  It's still a good choice to eat downstairs and go clubbing upstairs afterwards (because you avoid an extra taxi ride in between dinner and partying), but you need to make reservations at both locations BEFORE coming out, otherwise you risk having to wait in line.",

Yet we waited almost an hour for our table!  We almost bailed then, but we were really hungry and Asian food sounded good.   You've crammed too many tables on the floor near the Buddha.  Our table was so close to the other tables, that some of us had to get out of our seats to let the servers by.   Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.  We were charged about $40 worth of drinks we did not order.  We had a party of 7, yet we were charged for 8 sodas.  Only two people had a coke, without being offered a refill.  We had some bottles of Corona on our tab.  Corona?  Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???  Our server acted like he was doing us a favor by taking our order.  He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.  I will never waste my time going to Tao LV again.",

The vegetables were cooked just right and so tasty, and the Pad Thai had just enough peanut and spice in it.  I also enjoyed the Tao-Tini off of their specialty cocktails menu. It's a little sweet, so one drink was enough for me.  Be sure to make a reservation because the restaurant is very popular and will fill up very quickly.

I was disappointed. My friend got sushi, it was really good. My other friend got swordfish it was good. I got chicken and while it was good (you can't mess up chicken), it wasn't worth $25. For $25 I got a thigh and half a breast of chicken and... and what? That's it. Fine dining at it's best... I don't get a side of veggies or rice or tates, just chicken.   Maybe I don't understand the whole realm of fine dining, but why would I pay $25 for a piece of chicken that I could definitely cook better at home and not get anything to compliment it?   The decor was nice and all but honestly, it's a little too dim in their for me. Sure, it sets a mood blah blah blah, but I'm not going to be in any mood but seeing an optometrist after I have to strain my eyes looking at the menu in dusk-like light.  As much as I enjoyed a piece of my friends sushi, I'm confident in saying that I will not be returning here in the near future.

If you have a few friends in town that want to experience the Vegas seen for dinner and go clubbing all night than this is a great place to start. If you're a real foodie who enjoys amazing food and the experience is only a small part of the dinner, save your money and head to Nobu.",

We had 10 pm reservations and got there on time only to wait 50 minutes for a table. Actually the wait might have been longer but I had had enough by that point, there was only so long I could sit with other sad people waiting for tables before returning to the maitre d and informing them where they could stick their pager.   I get that they are busy but that sort of delay is unacceptable. Especially for a purportedly high end place with over priced food and drinks. Unless you really get off on snobbery, slow service, and/or proving how cool you are by where you ate dinner, you are better off spending your time and money at any of the other great restaurants and clubs in Vegas.",

I went to Las Vegas for a Bachelorette Weekend and we decided we needed one \"real\" meal and that Tao was the place to do it.  They were incredibly accommodating with our reservation, letting us push it back so we could take more time to primp for the evening.  We were seated almost immediately and had lavish drinks in our hands just as quickly.  I ordered some sushi and where you normally get two pieces of yummy fish for one solid price, at Tao you only get one (whomp whomp).  The miso soup was delicious and the cucumber sunomono salad was tangy and sweet, just the way I like it.   I'd definitely go back, but I'd probably try to find a Groupon or discount coupon first.",

    "text": "I LOVE everything about this place!  It's a restaurant/night club at the Venetian.  When we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. One of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in Vegas.     We got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  People were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!  This place is very trendy, very hip.  The decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that I saw.  It was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.  The one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  Loud music was busting from the night club.  If you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  But then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.  We had ordered: Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles Pad Thai Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork Crispy Coconut Shrimp Chai Kiss Chocolate Lave for dessert  I won't even try to describe each of them.  Everything on our table was oh so good.  There was nothing that we didn't like.  We also ordered cocktails and they were refreshing.  All was good good good.  After dinner, we hit the club.  We liked the kind of music they were playing.  The dance floor was great.  It was packed and crowded.   We just had a good time here.  This is definitely a must go restaurant/nightclub in Vegas.",

The host made us wait and said \"I'll see what I can do\" when we said we didn't have a reservation, giving us the impression that they might be booked. Inside, there were enough tables to make my girlfriend and I roll our eyes.    The Good: The drinks were amazing. We had the Tiger Lilly and the Black Pearl. The desert was also amazing (molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream).  My girlfriend really liked the spicy smoked salmon roll. We thought the jalapeno yellowtail was decent. The decor is really pretty.    The bad: The bus staff rushed around us and passed things over our head unsteadily. It makes it hard to relax when you worry that your girlfriend is going to get trampled because she's near a service entrance. The waiter was nice, but paced the meal poorly, so we spent a lot of time just waiting after we finished our jalapeno yellowtail. The music was also very loud and made it hard for us to hear each other or the waiter.  The ugly: The sushi wasn't fresh. The wild yellowtail, the white tuna and the hawaiian snapper were all virtually indistinguishable because they shared a common tinge of whatever coolers they were in. The soft shell crab roll was pretty tasteless and the sauce didn't add anything other than moisture to a dry roll.     My tiny girlfriend was hungry again after a couple of hours in the casino and we ended up going for another meal, so was that $130+tip we spent at Tao worth it?",

However, when we arrived there, we were informed by our server that we must each order 1 entree from The Sea, The Land, or The Sky, or 2 rolls, which would be 25+ for each. Didn't turn out to be a big deal because everyone was pretty hungry.   I would definitely recommend the miso glazed sea bass. It was delicious! But be sure to order a side or rice because it'd be too sweet without it.  The orange chicken doesn't resemble anything from Panda Express and comes in a large portion with a side of rice. Not bad, but I'd prefer the sea bass.  Thai Buddha Chicken is a mystery. I am not quite sure what it is exactly, but it was juicy and tasty nontheless.   And we got our stamps and got into the club with no troubles for the rest of the night. The dinner average out to about $40 / person.",

The hostess suggested we sit at the sushi bar to avoid a wait for a table and then failed to walk us to the back to seat us. We awkwardly wandered through the restaurant until we reached the sushi bar in the back and there we not even any open seat there. Once we were finally seated our waiter brought us water and took our order. We said we wanted to hold off on ordering drinks until we got our food.  A different waiter than or original one brought out our food and we were never checked on. Didn't have the chance to order drinks, no one asked how our food was or if we needed anything...we were totally ignored. I ended up asking a third staff member in passing to bring me a drink. A man who appeared to have a managerial position based on the way he was dressed was wandering around our area for awhile and never even picked up on the fact that we were not being helped. About an hour later we had to ask him where our server was just to get our bill and neither apologized to us.

His answer to me was \"oh we didn't think you would realize it\" and took it off the bill. I find it insane that they even tried to charge me for water they poured from the sink. The answer from the manager was just rude and not professional. At least apologize and offer dessert for trying to scam me. Another thing is how it was done in front of a client of mine. What the hell kind of service is this. I paid $250 dinner and they are this cheap to charge us for tap water. This is the biggest joke and I will never come back here.

Furthermore, the manager made a point to come in and check in on us throughout the meal to make sure we were enjoying everything and to apologize again for the delay, at the end he even sent us a giant fortune cookie for dessert that was heavenly. The manager and the staff did an amazing job turning our experience around and making sure we were truly happy and enjoying everything. I would definitely done here again.",

    "text": "I always have to get my TAO fix every time I go to Vegas.  Best Asian cuisine on the strip.  The food is always great and presentations creative. Haven't had a dish that I didn't like.  The wait staff is very professional, very knowledgeable from apps to dessert, cocktails to the wine list.  The evening that we were there, they offered a 3 course pre-pix menu for $55/person, with quite a few selections for each course.  The portions were plenty and the taste even more outstanding.  What we did was to get everything on the menu so we can share all the dishes.  Cocktails: TAO-hito, TAO's version of the classic Mojito with Bacardi Limon Rum Lychee Martini, Belvedere, Triple Sec and Fresh Lychee Puree  Mango Tamarind Martini, Finlandia Mango Vodka, Cranberry Juice and Tamarind Orient Express, Stolichnaya Vanilla Vodka, Kahlua and Chilled Espresso  Wines:   Shiraz, Hope Estates 2007, Hunter Valley, Australia  Appetizers: Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce - Chicken cooked just right.  Peanut sauce so tasty.  Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice Cakes - Tartare just seasoned perfectly.  I could have had two of these... that good!  Crispy Thai Shrimp with Spicy Pineapple Sauce - Shrimps were huge!  Spice just right.  Entrees: Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings - Wasabi crust not too overwhelming as Wasabi can be.  Filet cooked at medium with just the right pink to the meat.  Pad Thai Noodles - Best Pad Thai ever....  Soy Ginger Glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach - Salmon cooked medium, noodles flavorful.   Side Dishes:   Vegetable Fried Rice Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant  Desserts: Chocolate Spring Rolls w/Kalamansi Dipping Sauce - OMG Delish!!!  Crispy Fuji Apple Blossoms serviced with Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - OMG Delish!!! Assorted Ice Creams and Sorbets with Almond Sesame Cookies - OMG Delish!!!  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Food:  Made sure you bring a big appetite.  The dishes don't skip on portion control.  Service:  Outstanding.  Decor:  Very Asian with a ZEN like feel.  Bring you camera for some great photo opts.  You know us Asian just love to take pictures!  Price:  Can be pricey, but wouldn't you just want to dine at a place with a ZEN like atmosphere and enjoy your food with calm....  After dinner, the restaurant turns into a nightclub, so enjoy the rest of your evening drinking and dancing.  What a way to end the evening!  Highly Recommend!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "What an experience this evening was for me and my colleagues! I wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. I had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week. The entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. It has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic Buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. Ambiance is fabulous. Bring a light so that you can read the menu though!  Our server was Lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. Great humor and a lot of fun. I recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the Kardashian's reality show. Lovely lovely guy.  We started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. The standout was the Lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth. My friend and I practically licked the bottom of the bowl. Unbelievable.  Two of my friends ordered the steak which they both LOVED. The steaks came with three huge and gorgeous onion rings. Great presentation. My other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. The entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so I \"settled\" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce. I asked if I could get it not fried but told I couldn't. I think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. Disappointing as I would have been perfect if not fried. I was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. I felt such a waste to leave all that food. The portions are very generous.  We finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. My one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. Again we licked the bottom of the plate!! What a fabulous way to end the meal. The food and the ambiance were both outstanding. To top it off though was the service. Everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. Special shout out again to Lawrence our server. I did stop Dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. I found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. This is basically a tourist place and so I wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special.",

We started with a sake sampler. The waitress really took good care of us with her suggestions.  The three sakes were delicious all in their own way.  Lobster wonton in a yummy broth with mushrooms and onion came first. Unbelievable. Just delicious. Next came a Chilean seabass with a miso glaze, fried rice with duck, and spicy eggplant. The fried rice was so so but the seabass and eggplant dishes were amazing.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.   This was every bit as good as Nobu but in a better, warmer atmosphere.",

The kitchen DOES NOT accommodate patrons with dietary needs.There are few vegetarian and gluten free choices on the menu however the menu doesn't indicate which items contain shellfish/fish. Really? The waitress who was quite sweet thought the Pad Thai contained fish sauce, but wasn't sure if another sauce could substituted. NOPE, according to the chef, can't make the dish with another sauce because the NOODLES are soaked in sauce that contains fish and prepared in bulk for the day. (Staff are not educated on how the food is prepared). Apparently despite the fact the restaurant was HALF FULL, the CHEF COULD NOT BE BOTHERED TO BOIL up fish free noodles to prepare Pad Thai. I have eaten in many 5 star restaurants and have never encountered a chef unwilling to accommodate a life threatening allergy. We were visited 3 times by 3 apologetic staff, drinks were comped but frankly who wants to eat in place where the chef is a jerk!! We went down the way to Casablanca where the food, service and experience was FANTASTIC!!",

    "text": "I totally get it.  The promoters/owners lure you into Tao Restaurant, ply you with yummy food and drink, and then convince you that Tao Nightclub is just as upscale and well-done.  Don't fall for it!  Just eat the food, drink the booze, and leave!  You'll have a better night for it.  Tao Restaurant is amazing.  I loved the decor, the service, the short wait, and of course the food.  This behemoth of a restaurant does Asian fusion right.  I had the Tao-tini (after my requisite dirty Grey Goose on the rocks).  Fruity, strong as all hell, and delicious.  My PIC and I started with the lobster wontons.  Best.  Dish.  Ever.  Next time I go back, that's all I'm ordering.  We also had the lobster dumplings to start.  Good.  But definitely not the lobster wontons.  We then ordered the Thai fish hot pot, which had a very strong sauce, overpowering on its own, but perfect with steamed rice.  We made the mistake of ordering veggie fried brown rice.  Why were we trying to be healthy? Anyway, what came was a plate of veggies + mush.  Ugh.  Panda Express makes a better fried rice than that!  Upon leaving the Venetian, my PIC and I decided that next time, we're just ordering 6 servings of the lobster wontons.  And then heading to Jet to shake it all off!  P.S.  One of my students told me that her group of friends was offered free dinner + drinks + Tao admission the same weekend.  So if you have a group of 10+ cute Asian girls, you may get dinner for free!  Otherwise, expect to spend about $50/person, not including drinks.",

Our table of 7 (? it's been a while, I don't remember the exact number) spent about $40-$50 just on freaking water!!  The food was expensive too.

Because if it gets too busy it may be difficult for them to add more ppl to your party. Food is delicious. Had the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. Other dishes we ordered Fried Rice topped with Fried Egg, Hong Kong XO Shrimp & Thai Buddha Chicken. All scrumptious, & best of all is getting a stamp after dinner to go clubbing upstairs. But for Labor Day weekend, you still have to pay for admission even after dinner. The club is usually way over packed, especially during labor day weekend. Popular place, hip-hop music, fantastic asian food, great service...I can't wait to go back, back to Tao's Tao's UGH!!!",

Don't go there thinking that it will be anything like the location in NY ( which is a hometown fav) the Las Vegas version has an identity all of its own. I did the sushi platter with the chef's selection. Your better off sticking close to the sushi chef's for an entertaining night.   Personally I suggest bringing a crowd that can appreciate a place like Tao. The whole enviroment inspires intelligent conversation and anything less seems to put a damper on the whole experiance.   Even though I was a guest of Rich they STILL made me get a line pass and re enter just to go upstairs. I hear they make ppl pay to get in but they just let us walk up. Upstairs is cool. Naked women decorating the place is a perk.   Not a place to get your dance on .....stick to the bar behind the wierd skully wall.",

We had like 4 waiters, which was fine, but it was confusing when deciding how much to tip.   The waiters were pushy about drinks, so we got tea because it was late and we were tired, but it was fantastic and really nice to enjoy between courses.   As a party of two beware of ordering too much food~ an appetizer, entree, and side dish was more than enough for us. There is nothing bad on the menu and everything we ate was delicious.  *SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT....the chocolate molten cake and apple turnovers~WOW. The most perfect way to end the meal.

    "text": "It's probably no coincidence that I scheduled my afternoon full body massage at Canyon Ranch Spa on the day that I was eating dinner at Tao. Sound body followed by a sound appetite makes Scott a happy boy (an old Buddhist proverb).  I already knew what to expect from the Tao experience, and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the Venetian's baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner. Feeling relaxed like Gumby and dressed in my favorite black D&G suit, I rolled into our private party at Tao with a few people on my staff...we were greeted by a friendly and attentive wait staff holding trays of coconut shrimp, ginger-chicken ravioli, and chicken ginger dumplings...I was stuffed before the main event.  Since we had a large party, we did Tao buffet style. Here is the beef & reef sampling that I picked up along the line:  - A piece of miso glazed Chilean sea bass (Delighted my taste buds. Superb.) - A slice of wasabi-crusted filet mignon (Tender. Vibrant. Absolutely delicious.) - Chicken in hoisin sauce (Just okay. I've had better at Saigon Grill here in Manhattan) - Pad Thai noodles (Mildly nutty. Tender noodles. The sweet & spicy flavor wasn't balanced enough for me...hey, I'm a pad thai snob.)  The best part was the dessert. Nothing is sweeter than watching the \"WTF?\" looks on the faces of people waiting to get into the nightclub as 150 of us are given priority access. Oh well, sometimes membership does have its privileges. The rest of my evening is well-documented and sealed inside the Vegas city limits ;-)",

The food was very good.. although it was way too expensive and the portion sizes were tiny! I guess this is to be expected in a place like this.. but  honestly, for asian fusion flavor you might as well go to P.F. Changs. The atmosphere is not nearly as good, but you get your moneys worth.  The drinks were even more outrageous than the food. I had a Grey Goose and Cranberry... $16. Seriously.. for one little drink with more ice than booze.   Our server was a complete... a-hem. She was covertly and outwardly hostile the entire meal. We were pleasant, not demanding, ordered lots of food, drinks, etc... she should have been happy to have our table!  Long story shortish, if you want to be in a visually appealing, trendy place and you don't mind paying for it. Then, definitely go.  But watch out for snotty serving people.",

    "text": "Tao is completely over hyped. It's nicely decorated and the people working at Tao are all very pretty. The DJ is even great. But the food is awful and the entire meal felt rushed. I felt like the waiters were really trying to turn the tables over quickly. The waiter even took my cocktail and didn't ask if I wanted another. This also happened with the food. But that's not even the worst part. The worst part was the actual food. Maybe I'm spoiled, living in the Bay Area. We have so much great Asian food. Tao just couldn't compare. Not even close. I understand it's Asian fusion, but it just did not taste good.  The appetizers were OK. We had lobster wontons, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. Of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. For dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. Just awful. We also had the miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass and it was tasty but I think it was undercooked. About a half hour after eating it, I got really sick. We kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if I hadn't even eaten it. It honestly could have been anything I ate there that made me sick, but I really think it was the sea bass.   We even had plans to go to the nightclub afterwards but we had such a terrible dinner we wanted to get the hell out of there. We ended up at the Palms. Avoid Tao. It's just not worth it.",

    "text": "I had a horrible experience here all due to the staff. We had 9:45 reservations at the restaurant and the morning of our reservation they called to confirm. We thought Tao was the perfect place for dinner because we heard about the great food and if you eat dinner there   Later that evening we got to the restaurant at 9:40 to make sure we were seated promptly. A lot of us were starving because of the late dinner reservation but that was what we could get. 10:10 we stil weren't seated. I decided to go drop off something at the hotel room since we were staying in the Palazzo. Being that we had a late dinner reservation I decided to try to get a stamp to ensure that I could easily come back to the restaurant. I go to this desk near the door to ask for a stamp. The guy tells me that I need to get in line for a stamp. I look at the line and it's empty so I crawled under the rope. Immediately this security guard comes over.  Guard: Excuse me Maam, you'll need to go all the way outside to get in line. You can't line jump.  I look out at the entrance which was only a few feet from me and there's still no one in line.  Me: Umm there's no one in line.  Guard: I know that but you can't line jump. My manager won't have it and I'll be the weak link.  So begrudgingly I go outside. There's another guard at the entrance. He proceeds to tell me that it's a $20 cover to get in.  Me: What? I was just in the restaurant and they told me to come out here to get a stamp. I have dinner reservations here and just want to drop something off in my room  Guard 2: Well if you have dinner reservations you'll have to get in the reservation line to get a stamp.  Me: I was in the reservation line to check in and they didn't give us a stamp.  Guard 2: Well that's where you'll need to go  I stand in the reservation line. A guy is yelling at the hostess letting her know that he's been waiting 50 minutes for a table, and they had reservations too. The hostess wasn't giving in and the guy got angry, threw the pager at her, and yelled some obscenities.  I proceed to tell my story to the hostess and she tells me that she has to get the stamp girl to come over to give me a stamp and I have to wait. My friend Kelly comes up to the desk because we've been waiting for a while for our table. Kelly talks to the hostess.  Hostess: Oh right, you had a table for 4  Kelly: No 8. You guys called this morning to confirm  Hostess: 8? Oh... well then you'll have to come back in 5 minutes and then I can tell you what's available.  Kelly: Why can't you tell me what's available now? We had 9:45 reservations and it's 10:20 now.  Hostess: Just come back in 5 minutes and I'll let you know what's available.  kelly and I are upset but because we had a group of girls for a bacheleorette and they all wanted to go clubbing, Tao was the best option because we get dinner and the club included so we decide to proceed with dinner.  I then proceed to ask the hostess again about the stamp. She says that I need to finish my dinner before I can get stamped. UGH!  We finally get seated and eat our meal. The food isn't that great. I've gotten better at normal $5 chinese restaurants. The waiter brings Kelly brown rice instead of white. She mentions it and he says, \"Don't worry I won't charge you for it.\"   At the end of dinner, lo and behold we were charged for the rice. Kelly mentions it and tells the guy that he said he wouldn't charge.  Waiter: I don't remember saying that. Since you ate it we have to charge you for it  Kelly: No i mentioned it to you and you said you wouldn't. That's the reason I ate it  Waiter: Tell you what. I can hook you up. I'll get the girl to stamp you so that you can get into the club.  We are SUPPOSED TO GET INTO THE CLUB if we have dinner there!!! Never again will I go there!",

Once you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.  It's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and Red Bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a Sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for. Well duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the Sudan. On the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.  Avoid the 'family' meal experience. The bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us.  Stick with the sake bombers instead.  Tao has a unique device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. It's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times. Don't forget to shout out some Asian babble as you salute the Emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.  The sea bass was a triumph. The beef was like butter - I'm guessing it was Kobe, and if it wasn't, it was likely from a bull who'd had his nuts cupped daily by some half wit.",

We remarked we would take them to the shoe shine as they were stained . At this point, front of the house manager was there , no offer of any comps . Nothing, just awkward silence. Word of advice - next time offer a drink or dessert when any service member spills on guests, just a thought. As for the food - tempura was greasy with the dipping sauce being flavorless. Fried rice with duck was excellent. Seared tuna was over cooked and dry . Overall , disappointing. I wouldn't come back and it negatively affected my view of The Venetian as well.",

We sat at the bar while we waited for out table and I chose to do a signature cocktail (I usually just drink Scotch on the rocks) The cocktail was wonderful and not too pricey. We got a seat right next to the large Buddha and had a wonderful server. The food was excellent and my husband was brought a giant fortune cookie filled with chocolate mousse as a Birthday dessert.",

So I went to Tao the night before attending a conference with some of my co-workers (the party peeps).  There were 8 of us and we had resos...but we forgot about the taxi wait and walking in 5 inch heels...first night rookie mistake.  We called to push the reso by like 15 minutes.  The first half of our group arrived and we were immediately seated in the lounge area until the second half arrived.  Upon their arrival we were immediately seated.  Our waitress was really sweet but she seemed new.  She took our drink orders...all adult beverages and water and then suggested we do the tasting menu...they like to offer that for larger parties.  I think primarily to make it easier on the kitchen...good luck with that with this group...let's just say #ADDisOurNativeLanguage we opted for individual entrees which was fine by me.  I was going to order the lobster kim chee fried rice but when I asked she said it wasn't her fav.  I asked which of the rice dishes was and she said the either of the duck fried rice dishes so I opted for the Thai duck fried rice and it was amazing!! #YummyYummyGetInMyTummy.    All and all a nice dining experience but there were some small issues with the timing of the dishes being delivered to the table and two items did not make it to our table and had to be re-ordered but such it life.  I'll still go back though.",

All that said, my concerns were unfounded.  The food was divine!!  We started with the Lobster Spring Rolls which were delish ...the Sea Bass truly is one of the best things I've ever eaten (apparently that's their sig dish) but the shut yo minute dish was the Coconut Shrimp.  Huge shrimp in this crispy coconut coating was beyond yummy ...  We finished with the Fortune Cookie which is much much more than a cookie!!   Full and a wee bit tipsy we went through the gyrations to get into the club (why so many stamps and check points??)   Party if was!!! Really amazing costumes. Great music. A place to stand or Dance.  Best of five clubs we visited!",

For starters, the bathtub looking decorations on the way in were stunning- filled with water and fresh rose petals with floating candles, absolutely gorgeous! There was no wait (amazing, given all the other reviews, but it was a Monday night...) so we were seated right by the floating Buddha. As for that-- this statue is breath-taking! It is approximately 20 feet tall, and appears to be floating on the pond of live koi fish. I happily drank with the TAO-tini (delish) and my companion had the lychee tini (a little too sweet for her) then the berries and bubbles (very good).  We started with the Chicken Gyoza with Napa Cabbage and Soy Dipping Sauce (steamed) and we inhaled it. PERFECT! We then shared the miso glazed chilean sea bass over veggies (excellent) and the chicken pad thai (very good- not as spicy as I'd have liked though). The dessert menu was very diverse, and we settled on a 6-pack of buddha chocolates (adorably packaged-- almost too cute to eat! Milk, white and dark chocolates).  The ambiance was absolutely divine, so much so that we did not want to leave. But our bellies were full, our drink glasses empty and the hour late-- so we did depart after all. But for sure, I will be going back!!",

Not only that, they decided to \"appease\" us by giving us a free round of drinks which was not something we wanted from them. Along with the fact that both my friends who ordered the same entree the peppered steak got horribly sick from it, and they not only did they kick them out because they thought they were drunk, but they didn't apologize, refund our tickets to the club which we could not attend because my friends got sick from THEIR food. The assistant general manager RAUL CERON came out and gave a bs apology, told us to email him and he'll refund us our tickets, which he never did. He did not even respond to the emails we sent. Horrible horrible experience, staff, and place. So disappointing. I am spreading the word and people will not be going to the LA and Vegas location. Good luck you money hungry pigs!",

I reserved there 21st Birthday Package which included free entry for up to 15, free drink tickets for each of your guest, VIP entry and a photo in front of there red carpet. AGAIN, all of there staff including security were so friendly! While we did not reserve a table the one guard let our older party guests sit while the place was not as crowded.  After 11:15 the place really started to get packed. Lots of air conditioning and fans which was cooling, pun intended. A fun and \"pumpin\" DJ. However, the dancefloor was so busy that random people spilled drinks all over me.   Not a fan of the half naked women standing on raised tables and shaking there butts. Gave the impression that it is okay to treat women and sexualized objects. I was indeed grabbed and felt objectified. It was my first and probably my last club. The excessive flashing lights did not help. If touchy men (and/or women) are going to be getting close to me I want my vision to be adjusted so I can see what's going on.   However, for those who enjoy the LAAARGE club feel- this is for you. TAO staff will make it worth your wild",

Why can't you bring the menus initially? Server tended to other tables bringing them checks, etc. Waited 15 minutes before we got menus.   Food was mediocre. I was with a big party so I let everyone else run the show. I would never on my own order crispy rice and tuna.  And I think the Asian food, majority of what we ordered, was catered towards non-Asians. The lettuce wraps were too salty, although they were literal cups of lettuce. It was cute. I would have liked to tried some other things on the menu. Will come back.  Side note: server disappeared many times. We didn't even see her on the floor.",

We arrived without reservations, but luckily for us, they had a few seats at the sushi bar in the back. It remained very busy the entire time we were there, so I'd recommend reservations if possible.  We ordered the veggie kung pao, which was not AT ALL like kung pao. It was more like a mild sweet and sour sauce. Oddly, the kung pao didn't come with rice, so we ordered a side of it separately. We also ordered the vegetarian udon noodles, which were fine but somehow managed to miss the spot for me. Our third dish was a hamachi sashimi dish that was to die for! They put sliced jalapenos and a ponzu sauce on it. If I went back, I could just order 3 of those and be satisfied.   Overall, a decent place. Due to noise, I wouldn't suggest this as a place for a romantic dinner or business meeting (unless you weren't particularly fond of the people you're with, lol).",

The main reason I am writing this is because of the \"bouncer\"(very tall with a beard). We went into the restaurant, party of 12, then towards the end of the dinner I went outside, my wife came out to check on me. She had a drink, tried to go back in with the drink she had when she left. He wouldn't let us back in. He didn't even want to give us a chance to give us a reason why we were going back in where we just  spent a lot of money, I wish I got his name because he ruined the experience and thus now whenever we go back to Vegas as we frequently do will NEVER spend our money there!",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant, exceptional staff, and good food; my only negative was you're paying for ambiance and service, not uniqueness or authenticity of the meals.  Tao has an Asian fusion vibe, not authentic, but not fake either.  The Buddhist iconography and kanji gave a mostly Chinese feel.  The restrooms were clean, but unfortunately had an attendant.  The restaurant was very crowded and popular, especially around the stairs leading to the (disappointing) nightclub.  I loved our table; it was a cozy and comfortable booth, but was near the kitchen so my coat was repeatedly knocked off my chair.  Our waitress that evening was perfect; friendly, efficient, and nice.  We had the filet mignon; it was succulent and I enjoyed lightly cooking each piece.  I enjoyed a beer and tea with dinner.  The host staff was funny and made me feel like our comfort was tantamount.    The conversation was the best part of dinner, while people watching and taking in the ambiance.  This is a good place to try among the culinary smorgasbord present in Las Vegas.",

For drinks we had some very good Malbec wine and a full order of their \"Premiere\" cold saki, as well as several cold saki samples, and all were delicious.  Some of the best sushi and sashimi we've ever had (and we've had A LOT!).  Very nice, low-light, low-key ambience, great music, and our bartender was the BEST (we think his name was \"Ron\".

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here on our last night in Vegas to celebrate his birthday. We settled on Tao based on their advertised Gluten Free options. When we arrived, I told our server that I have celiac disease. We were informed that several of the GF menu items actually do contain gluten (barley). If menu items are not fully gluten free, they should NOT be listed as such. It is False advertising.  Our server tried to tell us \"there is a difference between gluten free and celiac\" -- how ridiculous. If an item contains gluten, it should not be listed as gluten free. Period. I have eaten at countless high end sushi restaurants and have never encountered anything like this before. Highly unusual.  On top of that, the service was slow and unprofessional. We were brought chilled saki instead of hot as requested. Which wouldn't have been a big deal, but it took 10 mins to get the server's attention after the mistake. The server was defensive when we brought up our concerns and then argued with my partner as to why he brought the wrong drink, instead of just offering to replace it with the correct one.  We spoke to the manager and then went to a different sushi restaurant at Caesars, which was incredible and has tons of GF options. The Tao manager offered us free appetizers and drinks upon our return... but we won't be back since my only appetizer choice is edamame. No thanks. It's 2017 - it's unacceptable for a sushi restaurant of this caliber to not have allergy-friendly options.  Anyone that needs to be strictly gluten free: do not go here! There are plenty of GF-friendly sushi restaurants in Vegas.  The only positive is the decor and atmosphere were great.",

There were two kinds of dumplings and one of them was SUPER good - I think they were kind of spicy, I can't really remember right now but they were awesome.

    "text": "So since my cousins and I were on a budget, we decided to all share our orders.  We ordered pad thai, shrimp tempura and some eggrolls.    The pad thai wasn't anything extraordinary.  I personally like the pad thai that I've had at San Jose with many ingredients.  Tao totally skimped out on us..which brings me to the shrimp tempura. So, when we ordered the shrimp which was $8, we expected there to be at least enough shrimp for the eight of us. however, when the waiter brought out our order, it consisted of two shrimps on a tiny platter. They weren't even prawns, they were those small tiger shrimps that you can buy in bulk at your local asian store for $8 a pack! Ridiculous! We expected at least four pieces of good sized shrimp but for a tiny cocktail shrimp?? No, that was a waste of our 8 bucks.  Lastly, my favorite has to be the eggrolls. Maybe I was overcome with hunger but they tasted really good.",

Otherwise the experience was less than satisfactory and I will not be returning any time soon.  My husband and I aren't big eaters and don't like wasting food so we almost always split meals.  The prix fixe menu looked amazing so we ordered that to share after the waiter recommended sharing the dishes family style. We were told that the prix fixe menu couldn't be shared. My husband protested because you should be able to do what you want with the food you order and because the restaurant would be making more money than if we just split 1 dish, which would have been the alternative. Our waiter took it up with the manager who allowed us to share, which was a plus. However the quality of service we received from our waiter quickly deteriorated after that. We got more service from the waiter serving the table next to us.  The food wasn't spectacular either. Having had many experiences with Americanized Asian food, I can say that the PF Changs meals you buy frozen in a bag are better than Tao. The filet was drowned in a sticky, sweet sauce and didn't taste like filet. The chocolate egg roll had way too much chocolate.  If you want to experience one of the Tao Group's restaurants, I highly reommend Lavo because Tao doesn't live up to its hype.",

For dessert the giant fortune cookie was beautiful... a giant fortune cookie dipped with white and milk chocolate with fresh fruits (berries, lychee, banana, etc).

We showed up early.. Walked right in.... Had a drink at the cool bar. We got seated right on time for our reservation.. The interior is pretty impressive. Lots of people everywhere....They have a big Buddha statue.. Of course we took a picture in front of it.. As for the food, the portions are small, but ordered enough food... With drinks, we walked out of there for 230 bucks for four of us.. I ordered the fillet Mignon.. It was hot.. cooked perfect and actually very tasty,.. Overall, Tao is cool. We would go back..Oh yeah, we got to walk right into the club with no cover... Rock n roll!!!",

The food is quite good, especially their kobi sushi roll (I think that's what they're called? Whatever the hell they're called, they're incredible!) appetizer.  The rest of the meals have been a little forgettable, but I remember them tasting good, hehe.

    "text": "We went to the Tao Asian Bistro that is a celebrity hangout in The Venetian.  It is over 42,000 square feet, that boasts a nightclub, lounge and restaurant.  The decor is lush velvets, waterfalls , many unique Buddha sculptures and a hand-carved 20-foot tall Buddha floating over a pond.   The food was awesome. Kudos to Sam Hazen the executive chef who has created a menu that features specialties from China, Japan and Thailand. Not going to list everything ordered, as that would make for a very long blog. But the highlights were the Lobster Wontons, the addictive Edamame, Filet Mignon, a Sea Bass dish that was unlike anything that I have ever had, and of course all topped off with a hot sake.  The only downside to the visit - even though we had reservations -  we had to wait an hour for a table.   But I will go back just for the dessert - Chocolate and Raspberry Wontons served with Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice-Cream. (Next time - NO SHARING!!).",

I was in Vegas with my kids and really wanted to go to TAO since it was incredible 18months ago when my husband and I went alone.  We made an early reservation and dined ahead of the night club crowd.  The food was so delicious.  My son who loves asian food said it is the best and my picky daughter left stuffed.  Chilean sea bass, lobster won tons, spicy wonton soup, vegetable dumplings- everything was fresh, full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  The donuts were a tasty ending.  The staff was very attentive.  The ambiance is great - it is an experience!",

I admit the servers were very good, attentive, talkative, the atmosphere was not bad either but the food........ unbelievably average!! Coming from Los Angeles, I guess we are so used to good quality, high standard Asian bistro type of food. Most of the food we had were so salty. I started to wonder if they wanted us to keep ordering wines and beers to wash it down. Filet mignon steak - tender and juicy good portion of beef , but why wasabi flavor bread crumbs outside??? We were impressed with the desserts, everything was yummy.  I can give 4 stars to their desserts.",

That's a little bizarre to me, but then again, Vegas in itself is pretty bizarre.  Tao wins in the arenas of drinks and appetizers - seriously their Taotini is the most delicious drink I have ever sipped.  And the Chilean sea bass skewers were truly incredible.    This is a good place to start your night in Vegas, but make sure to leave plenty of time to wait in line even with a reservation.  And prepare to speak loudly to your dining partners because the music is bumpin!",

    "text": "It kills me to write this review. This is maybe the most disappointing dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. I brought a group of 11 here last Thursday night. Our waiter's name was Bobby. He strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, FYI).  So after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. Fried pork buns, spring rolls, short ribs, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. Our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. Also, I thought all of it was delicious.   Unfortunately, this is where our fun ended. About an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the FIRST time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. We said, \"Ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\". He acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. He left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. Well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. I told Bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. He tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. But I disagreed and he got a little upset with me. He told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. So we waited. Again. Ten more minutes went by and I walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. I said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. He said that was fine. Moments later the food finally came out. But it was too late.Almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party.   Two minutes later, Bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. I told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. He got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after I demanded the bill.  We finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. For appetizers and about 13 drinks. We tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a True apology for screwing up our dinner.   What stinks, is that I was the reason my group went to dinner here! I convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. Even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. Seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks.   Needless to say, I will never go there again. And 10 other people will never go again either. Its a good thing Las Vegas has so many awesome places to dine. And for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!",

I think the key is making a reservation well in advance and expect that you will have to get a drink in the lounge while you wait for your table. (Max wait has been 20-30 minutes, nothing compared to the 1.5 hour wait the first time) It's a great place for groups as you can tell them your preferences and have them just bring out a bunch of items for the table.",

    "text": "It's fairly rare that I'll kick out a 5 star review. In my opinion, a restaurant has to meet or exceed on ALL expectations in order to achieve a five star rating. That said, Tao Las Vegas achieves exactly this.   I have eaten here many times at this point but this particular review is for dinner last Saturday. I was in town with friends for a birthday celebration. There were 5 of them and none of them had ever gone to Tao. So, I wanted to share the love and expose them to the joy of Tao cuisine.  Our reservation was for 6:30PM. We arrived 10 minutes early and were seated promptly. We quietly pulled the server aside and let him know that it was a birthday dinner and he promised to take care of it.   During dinner, we ordered everything from the steak (amazing!) to the TAO Angry Dragon roll (highly recommended). Some items that I recommend, in no particular order:  TAO Angry Dragon Roll - Delicious Satay of Chilean Sea Bass w/ Wok Roasted Asparagus - no trip to Tao is completely without this Lobster Wontons - a good secondary choice - if you have room add this  One thing I should point out - if you're feeling like steak, don't shy away from TAO's offerings. They were FANTASTIC! And very uniquely seasoned.   In fact I want one right now.  Last but not least - the restaurant delighted us by bringing us a huge fortune cookie for my friend's birthday, filled with chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse.  FYI the chocolate mousse was the best that I've ever tasted!  And finally - they ended the night by serving us delicious coffee.   Thank you Tao. I love you. And I'll be back to see you again really really soon.",

But even with the \"trendy charge\" factored in, this restaurant was still too pricey, so I am giving it only 2 stars.  There is a difference between being hip and pretentious, and Tao errs on the wrong side of that fine line.  I can't quite figure out why, but it just doesn't have the same spirit as Buddha Bar in Paris, a restaurant with similar theme.  $15 for a piece of Otoro sashimi is just too much.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to visit Tao after watching a Cirque show. We were quite tired and hungry from all the walking, so all we wanted was a place to sit, relax, eat, and drink. Tao seemed like the pretty obvious choice since we were staying at The Venetian, but we were definitely wrong.  We walked into the dimly lit establishment and we were greeted by 3 individuals at the door. As if the doormen didn't scream \"pretentious\", we just had to walk in to find out more.  One of the hostesses walked us over to our table and said that the waiter would be over shortly. We waited, and waited, and waited and waited until my boyfriend looked at me with pity because I appeared to be very thirsty and no one had come to take our drink orders after 20 minutes! This is beyond ridiculous, IMO, especially when there were about 3 waiters circulating in our area. As he grabbed my hand to pull me out of there, a waitress came by (in the nick of time), to say \"oh, where are you going?\" when we proceeded to say \"we were just about to leave\" when her slew of apologies came flourishing out and we felt obliged to stay. At about 25 minutes into our stay, we finally received our glasses of water.   That night, I decided to order the chicken pad thai while my bf had the crispy orange chicken. Our waitress put a rush order in for our food and we were served in less than 15 minutes. Pad thai- flavorless and watery. It almost felt like a pad thai soup. I thought letting it sit for a bit would cool it down and let the sauce thicken, but that didn't help Crispy orange chicken- it was good, but it wasn't amazing.   Our waitress then decided to go on break and left us waitressless. We asked about 3 people for our bill because we had had enough, but it wasn't until 15 minutes later that we finally received our bill. My bf and I religiously tip our waiters, but this was just a downhill battle that Tao would not win. Tip? Provide better service and don't rely on the hype around your establishment to make your food taste better.",

The place is very dark and filled with Asian tchotchkes and photos. Disney meets China. It had a manufactured vibe, similar to a PF CHANGS. Not really good but good enough.

I actually ate here twice on this trip to Las Vegas and I was extremely disappointed both times. The first time we went we ordered a couple of appetizers and a few sushi rolls. The lobster wonton was good but the sushi rolls were not. They came out 2 minutes after ordering them meaning that they had been made well in advance and they were no where near as good as in the past. We also got several piecess of salmon, tuna and yellowtail sashimi. In the past they would have brought us one big tray with all of this sushi as well as lemon, cucumber and other extras that drastically change the flavor of the sushi in a good way. This time it was quickly thrown on a small plate and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  I ended going again because some other friends had just gotten in town and wanted to try it out. Once again I was disappointed. The sashimi was still way over priced. We go the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and ponzu and it was good but not $20 good for 4 small (really small) pieces. The sea bass was good but not good enough to out weigh the negatives.  The atmosphere is still fun but it is slightly louder then I remember. You can tell that the place is going downhill in popularity as well since there were over 50% of the tables were empty on a Friday night at 9:00.",

    "text": "We ate at Tao this past weekend for our groups official bachelor party dinner and it was a major success. I set up the dinner about a month in advance for our group of 14.  I did a lot of research at other spots for a nice set menu dinner, and we ended up choosing Tao based on what they offered for the given price, and their great location on the strip. We almost did a steakhouse dinner elsewhere, but it would have come with less courses, and about $100 more per person.    Anyway, working with the Tao group was great. They provided us with a nice custom set menu, which really gives the dinner an 'official' feel, and always impresses the guest of honor. We all arrived and were greeted and escorted to the semi-private dining room which overlooks the restaurant. I was a bit shocked because I thought we needed 16 to get the room, but I guess based on our time slot and availability, we were able to be seated there.  This was awesome, and the whole group was way impressed already.   We had a great spread of food, and they did a wonderful job with the portions and dividing it up well based on the seating. It wasn't tons of food, but it was still a good amount to leave everyone happy. The Peking duck spring rolls were a huge hit during the appetizer course. For our entrees, we went with orange chicken and the wasabi crusted filet mignon, and then a bunch of sides. Both were big hits, especially the orange chicken.  Then the dessert course came, which was ridiculous. The spread they brought out could have filled everyone up if that was the only thing we ate. Everything was amazing.   Also the service was great throughout the event. No one seemed to be waiting for a drink which was awesome.  We were probably loud with speeches/toasts/etc, so having the semi-private area was perfect.   All in all, everything went so smoothly from course to course, and we all left there in great spirits for the night ahead. Every one of the guys kept giving me props setting the dinner up and praises for how the food was just right in terms of what we got and how much we got of it.  It was an awesome feeling and confirmed that we definitely chose the right place for our bachelor parfy dinner, so I wanted to share some of the credit by writing this review.  Bravo.",

    "text": "The sushi I ordered was very good, but that's about it. The menu is EXTREMELY overpriced. So overpriced that the good sushi and rice isn't enough to bring it up to 2 stars. If I hadn't come here with gift cards I'd have been super pissed. The food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the filet mignon in my main dish I promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. Serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.  The filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a McDonalds chicken nugget. The whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. The chicken that my fiance ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. I had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. Not something I would have ordered. Also, I was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.  We ordered a side of pork fried rice also. This was a semi-bright spot on the night. The rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. Big fans of veggies. But the pork in the rice was bad. It was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.  Now the sushi was amazing. I don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (I think), and a spicy-ish sauce. This roll was absolutely delicious, and I devoured it in like 5 minutes.  As a side note, the service was good. The waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. She was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.  I have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak I've had in a long time. I'll use it for sushi or drinks but after it's used up I definitely won't be back.",

I will definitely go again next year on my vacation. I will also recommend it to friends that plan on going to Vegas.  Be sure to open your fortune cookie for a cheeky fortune ;)",

Family style is the way to go here.  8 of us came and shared a bunch of dishes starting with the lobster wontons which were just the perfect starter.  Next came some rolls which were my least favorite dish of the night.  They weren't bad but not memorable.  Peking duck was the star of the show with its crispy skin and made for delicious wraps.  Phad thai was good but probably as good as any other phad thai you've had.  Sea bass was nice and flavorful.    Service is slow but food comes out fast.  Menu is slightly overpriced but for Vegas - it actually seems reasonable!",

And I'm pleased to announce that the night went off without a hitch!   I'm not usually a fan of Asian fusion so my expectations were nonexistent but the menu was shockingly good:  The kimchi fried rice was perfectly balanced and the uni was pure creamy heaven. The bill was pretty reasonable considering our drunk asses were ordering like everything was free : $75/pp including tax& tip and that's AFTER covering our 2 guests of honor's split. In addition to good food and cocktails, our late dinner reservations successfully secured complimentary access to the club without a wait in line. It feels so good to stroll past the sour faces lined up outside for immediate entry. Just eat dinner here people, it's that simple!  The club was as crowded as it used to be when Jessica Simpson still had a career. Ok, maybe it's not that popping but it was still a really good showing. Oh, but whats with all the birthday shoutouts every 3 seconds? We don't care that Jennifer turned 21 and she's probably already passed out with her head in some random guy's lap. DJ: less talking, more music playing!",

    "text": "We had dinner reservations at 10:15pm on Saturday (April 9th) and due to the craziness of it all, our group of ten ladies ended up at two different tables (5/5).  (Our other option was to wait until 11pm to be seated at one table; no thanks!)  Btw, dinner reservations gets you complimentary entry to Tao Nightclub, which is right above the restaurant.  A promoter gave me and my girls bracelets for free drinks upstairs from 10pm-11pm and we managed to get one drink before being seated for dinner.  The food was good as usual (see pics): * Chicken satay with peanut sauce ($10) * Soy ginger-glazed salmon with udon noodles ($26) * Unagi (one for $5) * Uni (one for $8)  May seem like a lot of food, but bear in mind that the portions are very small.  You're paying more for the ambiance, I would say. I also tried their Tao-tini ($13), which was good and strong.  ;-)  Although the initial plan was to dance the night away at Tao Nightclub, our \"new friends\" from Tryst invited us to Marquee Nightclub at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We took them up on the offer since it's the new \"IT\" club, and we didn't have to wait in line or pay cover.  However, in hindsight, even though we had a good time at Marquee, I wish we had stayed at Tao.",

    "text": "After a long day on my feet while on a business trip yesterday, I was looking forward to sipping on a delicious cocktail and enjoying great food with co-workers. Instead, what I got was an unexpected surprise...  We arrived on time for our 8:00 p.m. reservation and were seated relatively quickly. The ambiance is very chic and trendy and the noise level actually wasn't as loud as I was expecting. Since there were six of us, we decided to order a variety of items from the menu like the Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Tempura Rolls, Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail Roll, Coconut Shrimp, and Spicy Smoked Salmon Roll to name a few.  Once the food began to arrive, we all started indulging in the sushi dishes. As I took my first bite of the Shrimp Tempura Roll (which was delicious by the way), I felt something hot dripping down my back... it was the Coconut Shrimp!!! YES, THE COCONUT SHRIMP! One of the people bringing the food to our table (not our waiter) had accidentally spilled the dish on my brand new WHITE blazer. Now, I understand that accidents happen. What bothers me is that the only apology I heard, was from our waiter (Edmond?) who had NOTHING to do with the incident. Even the manager did not apologize right away. He said he'd be back to check in on me... he did NOT check in on me during the remainder of the meal.   Once the six of us finished our meal, a complimentary platter filled with an assortment of desserts was delivered to our table (giant fortune cookie, ice cream, molten chocolate cake, chocolate Buddha)... as an apology I'd imagine since the only one I received by that point was from our waiter. Then (hallelujah!), the manager reappeared. He brought me a dry cleaning slip (which was useless considering I was leaving the next morning). He offered to reimburse me for the dry cleaning costs and if for some reason the dry cleaner could not remove the stains, they'd replace my white blazer for me. Then, once we received the bill, I FINALLY heard him apologize for the incident.  We were not comped for even a portion of the meal or offered a discount even though we asked. The waiter actually laughed when we asked which I felt was very unprofessional. We paid and left... never to return again! The food was pretty good but not worth the inconvenience and terribly unprofessional service from the management to the servers. Though Tao Asian Bistro had been recommended to us, we will not be recommending this place nor dining here in the future. I'll stick to Katsuya!  P.S. After dinner we went back to the hotel so I could change before going out. Turns out the Coconut Shrimp seeped through my white blazer and onto my shirt as well. I've posted the photos on my account. Feel free to check it out.",

I don't like sea bass, but I tried the Satay of Chilean Sea Bass with Roasted Asparagus (a small plate), and LOVED it!! Our table ordered half a dozen of these plates because it was a favorite by far!   Good selection of Cabernet wines too!  Also, if you want to get into Tao Nightclub, but don't want to pay or stand in line, make reservations and eat here first.

Rather, it's a competition among patrons to outdo each other in attire. Think 'little black dress' on steroids. And certainly not just the women (when did all-white suits come back in fashion?).   Again, food is fine and the decor and service are great. But the people-watching is the reason to go.   FYI, I went on a Saturday night which may have influenced my experience.   (Worth noting: the entrance is lined with beautiful large stone bathtubs with flowers floating in the water. On our way out there were bikini-clad Asian women kneeling in them...WTH?)",

I ordered the Tao-tini and my boyfriend ordered the Tao-Rita for drinks. Both drinks were good, but I would recommend the Tao-tini. For appetizers we ordered the lobster wontons and crispy rice tuna. For the best food experience, definitely order the crispy rice tuna as an appetizer. For our meal, we decided to order three different sushi rolls to start out. Each roll came with 8 pieces. To our surprise, three rolls filled us up and we didn't end up ordering more. We ordered spicy tuna, crunchy spicy yellowtail, and shrimp tempura rolls. My favorite was the crunchy spicy yellowtail and my boyfriends's favorite was the spicy tuna.  Not only was the food amazing, but the atmosphere and service was too!",

Upon entry, we waited at the lounge area, which was very nicely decorated and close in proximity to the restaurant diners. Within 10 minutes with our reservation, we were seated. Apparently there are deals in which you can bring a group of people and pay a certain amount for a variety of dishes that are served to you.  Thankfully, great price for the amount of food we got (7 girls paying about $15 each for the many plates of food, plus a cocktail and shot, & still had food left over), atmosphere and decor were beautiful, service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious! I will definitely be back again!   The only thing: it is pretty loud in there so it may be hard to hear your server or what type of food they are putting on your table. Don't be afraid to ask! **yes, there were vegetarian options with the variety of foods they put down. And they ask in advance if anyone is allergic to anything!",

Oversized bowls of candles and fresh rose petals, luscious velvet booths in a quite and serene atmosphere... don't let the entrance fool you.  We were escorted to the very back of the restaurant where the most obnoxious and loud guests were placed.  There was a group of 10 behind us and they were hooting and hollering like a bunch of uncivilized animals.  The waitress clearly needs to look for other employment or be trained on proper etiquette.  Asked a random server for a sushi menu since our waitress ignored us and he was unwilling to help us and stated he needed to let our waitress know, we literally watched her roll her eyes when he told her of our request.  I asked for a sweet tea and she looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears and told me no. The other guests at my table had dirty silverware with dried food crusted on them. We were told by family that Tao is a must while here in Vegas.  We experienced other high end restaurants while on our trip and the service was much better than what we received here.",

My children had not been in a restaurant this high-class before, but they handled it pretty well.  We were seated and taken care of well.   One bright example of how well they took care of us was that I asked what the staff would recommend for a diabetic patron. She gave us some good choices.  We ended up going with the shrimp lettuce wraps with Asian stir fry vegetables, and it worked out very well.    I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, and I loved it.   There were various layers of flavor in the dish. It wasn't too spicy for me, but did have a lovely hint of something that made it unique.   I also ordered some tea, and a family member and I really enjoyed it.   I am really picky about my tea, and it was good quality tea with a great flavor. Just a hint of strong smoke-like flavors, but not too much to overpower it.     I had had a celebration that day, and happened to mention it to the server.  She brought me a dessert: their signature dish.  The giant fortune cookie was loaded with white chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse, and different kinds of fruit, including cantaloupe, nice, tart raspberries, strawberries, and dragon fruit.  They had written \"congratulations\" on the plate, and I felt very celebrated.    If I ever return to a city where Tao has a restaurant, I will definitely attempt to eat there again.",

It seems like everyone says \"you have to go to TAO\" to eat if you are in Vegas. Not sure why as they are prob many other better places to eat. It's a fun place, so you can enjoy the food and have a good time but to me its more of a place to be seen rather then eat great quality food. Well at least I got it out of the way to go eat here so I don't have to go back. You are not paying for the food here because if you were then you be getting ripped off big time, you are paying for the scene and the name.",

We had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. I understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know.   Once we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. His recommendations were spot on. We started with the spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious).   He had us move onto sushi and had the Surf and Turf roll and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and Ponzu sauce. The yellowtail has a great balance of flavor and while the surf and turf roll was good, it had almost too many flavors going on.   We moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared New York sirloin (which was good and WAY less expensive than the 12 oz Kobe ribeye our waiter suggested), the Chilean sea bass (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the Buddha's vegetables. All were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group.   We finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share.   Overall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).",

    "text": "Beautiful. Relaxing. Fragrant. These are a few words to describe the overall experience at Tao's in the Venetian. If anyone is looking for excellent food at well rounded prices, then this is the place for you.  Nestled in the corner of the Venetian, a little ways from the indoor gondola ride area, Tao is an Asian food experience that is certain to make you want more. Not only is their service impeccable, but their food creations are sensational, beautifully balanced, and light. We went there to experience the hotel Asian cuisine a few weeks back, and I have to say that Tao was one of the best we've had in our lifetime.  After ordering tempura to start, we followed with a kobe steak, kung pao chicken, and lobster gyoza in a mushroom truffle miso sauce to die for. The tempura was light, flaky, and melted in my mouth. The winner appetizer, however, were the lobster gyozas. The sauce was incredible, the lobster was sweet and the dumpling part was so soft and perfectly chewy. The entire dish was well balanced to the point where I wanted to drink the broth! The steak was so soft that a knife was unncessary, and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. Our server was quick to refill at every turn, and there was so much to eat, dessert was not an option.  Although our dinner cost well over 180 dollars, it was well worth the experience. Not only is Tao restaurant a genius at Asian flavors, but a visual beauty. I honestly cannot say anything about this place except--exquisite.",

    "text": "If I could, I would give this place 3.5 stars.  To start with, we had our reservations at 10:15 but didn't actually get seated until well over 10:30.  The interior decor was very exotic and I loved the big buddha inside.    The food: I ordered the wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings.  To be honest, I could not taste the wasabi much and the onion rings were a bit too dough-y.  The filet mignon was not very flavorful so I don't know if I would order that again.  The other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the chilean sea bass and the buddha chicken.    The drinks: My friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  I'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it.   The dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!!   The service: It seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  He forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.  The layout:  the tables are VERY close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.  Also it was very loud in the restaurant.  I wouldn't recommend it for parties bigger than 4 because you cannot hear what people are saying.   The DJ:  The guy who was spinning the night we ate there was AWESOME",

    "text": "I have to give Tao five stars based on the fact that there was a waiter in Las Vegas who knew how to accomodate to a vegan. Make that one that even knew what a vegan was. (I got some strange looks and questions on how to spell v-e-g-a-n from concierges at some pretty prestigious hotels/restaurants)   So the VBF was happy and so was I. Our waiter was nice and honest about what a vegan could eat and what was cooked with chicken stock. had egg, etc. He also mentioned meat/chicken/fish dishes that could be substituted with tofu. I loved my duck fried rice and my roll was delicious. Plates were well-timed and we didn't have to do much waiting. The decor is pretty much like every Asian fusion higher-end restaurant in the West coast. Prices are very reasonable.  Try their version of the mojito, it's delicious!!",

    "text": "When planning my trip to Vegas, this was one place I had heard a lot about and thought I needed to try.  So, we booked reservations a week in advance through Open Table.   I knew the place was trendy, and in my experience, trendy means pretentious and disappointing.  My first impression, by the automated response I received from Open Table was not great.  The message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.  Isn't that their job???  I was kind of offended.    Anyway, I called to confirm and they were abrupt on the phone.  We got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         Once at the stand, I was given a buzzer and told that I needed to wait.  So, we waited 10 minutes.  There's good people-watching, but I'd rather be seated right away then wait when I have a reservation.    When the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in Vegas had been.  He thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  We were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story Asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  It was gorgeous.  The waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  We told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  He told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  Again...so nice...totally unexpected.    In typical fashion, I over ordered.  We had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  We also had tempura avocado (I'd never seen that before, and I don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  And...because I'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which I was looking forward to most of all.  They were probably the biggest disappointment.  The shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  Hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp.    For entrees we ordered the filet (B) and Thai seafood stew.  B thought his filet, was good...not as good as at Delmonico, but still good.  It was served with onion rings (one of the better things served).  The seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, shrimps, clams, lobster, and squid.  The broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.  It was a clear broth, though, which wasn't what I was expecting.  Due to the order ordering at the beginning of meal, there wasn't room for dessert.  Overall, 4 stars for great service, 3 for food.",

Be sure to get the Sea Bass (melts like buttah, baby) and take full advantage of the bar.  The  eggplant, while quite spicy, is really good (and i normally HATE eggplant).    The entire dining experience is great, and I found myself having a 3+ hr dinner at Tao (actually, we closed down the mezzanine dining level) and the waiter was not only attentive, but very personable.  The candle on our table went out and it took less than 30 seconds for someone to notice and replace it.  Yes, not really a critical part of having a nice dinner but it just showcases the level of service and attention to detail the wait staff had.  Everyone was willing to come by and ask how we're doing (including the mafia-don type manager who was really nice and actually kinda funny) but we didnt feel crowded at all.    It's a bit pricey, esp if you have several drinks, but it's well worth it.",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised by the food. I wanted to experience a trendy Vegas restaurant and heard mixed reviews on Tao (NY and Vegas). However, I really enjoyed my dinner here.  First of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. A restaurant called Tao, filled with numerous Buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of Buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? Not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. Not sure this is what Buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.  We had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. We got a drink at the bar. Yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for Vegas. Once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic Buddha. Our server was very friendly and informative. I felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.  As appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy white rice (basically like nigiri) and the toro toro roll. The dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. The spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. The toro toro roll was the weakest dish. The fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since I love toro. This roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that I did not love.   We also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed sea bass. The steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. The miso-glazed sea bass was delicious and perfectly cooked. The vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the sea bass was so beautifully cooked that I didn't care too much.  Definitely a fun, vibrant, LOUD environment. Overall, I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and I enjoyed the atmosphere.",

The decor is outstanding, Buddha statues all around, including one 30 foot one.  The food is Asian fusion.  I had salmon/avocado/crab roll which was excellent (real crab.)  The duck spring rolls were a bit over done, but tasty.  We had the lobster sea food dish, the lobster was  a bit overcooked and the sauce was heavy, but the dish was good.  The soups were very well done (cream corn and hot and sour.)  The blueberry won ton dessert was just excellent.  If I'd had more room I would have ordered another. We had the lettuce wraps, which were okay, but pretty standard.    I had a couple of sake flights (they have an excellent selection) which were delightful.  The wine list is very good.  Don't bother asking for a blended drink, 'it takes too much time...\" the waiter claimed.    The service was very good, actually too good, as they started bugging us too much.  First to explain every single dish on the menu in excruciating detail (it is a big,eclectic menu.)  then to constantly refill my water glass every time I set it down.    It was a good meal overall and I'd recommend it.  We got their early with reservations when they opened and were promptly seated.",

It's no wonder that this place has earned its title as a classic Vegas hotspot.  The entrance to the restaurant is flanked by bathtubs. But not just any bathtubs - big and deep stone tubs filled to the brim with what I imagine is deliciously scented bathwater, accessorized with floating candles, and topped off with flamingo pink and lemon yellow rose petals. And when you're led into the main dining room and greeted by the sight of a majestic 20 ft tall Buddha floating above a koi pond and blessing you with its effortless zen chic energy? Truly sensational. Talk about setting the mood. TAO really knows how to feng their shui!  Recommended items: - Chicken wing lollipops  - Roasted shishito peppers  - Chicken satay  - Miso Chilean sea bass  - Wasabi-crusted filet mignon  - Giant fortune cookie  Overall, TAO totally nails the Strip ethos of leisure, spectacle and sensuality. And with free entry into the adjacent nightclub included with dinner, TAO is a no-brainer for a one-stop shop night out!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner first time. Very crowded on a Thursday night. Good ambiance, I like the big Buddha statue and I believe the branch in NYC has a similar decor.   Cocktails we're good and pretty standard for this type of venue. As the night went on the table did order sake bombs that come in this neat holder haha.   For appetizers we tried the edamame, shishito peppers and salad. All were good but nothing exceptional. For main dishes we had the Tao lo Mei, pepper steak and salmon. All were tasty but nothing exceptional again.   Would recommend trying it out more for vibe than food.",

Constant water refills, cleaning off our table, removing finished dishes, friendly waiters, etc.! -The food came out FAST! I was worried that on a friday night with a lot of people, the food would take a long time to wait for but there was very little waiting time. -The food was yummy. I loved the miso glaze chilean sea bass and the roasted pork fried rice. The sizzling soy chicken was also good. It had the flavor of orange chicken from panda express (which I love btw) but less fried breading. -The drinks were okay. A little too sweet for me but I think others would enjoy. -The ambiance was obviously stunning with the floral baths with candles at the entrance, the hanging lantern lights, the red glowing atmosphere, and asian themed decor.  Overall, my friend and I had a great experience coming here and would definitely want to come back!",

Heavenly taste  and abundant serving size.   Did not like the service though. Understand that serving a big group ( 21) is a work but we still deserved the best service we could get. The waiter pushed us  to get the packaged menu with a reason that giving us our order and having a separate check will be taking time.  Nevertheless, few on us  stayed on the single menu.   The place is classy, small and dark. I believe for me to enjoy my food, I need sufficient lighting. The inspiring decor is a plus for the experience.",

    "text": "There are SO many better Asian places on (and near) the strip. The first thing that left a bad taste in our mouth was the rude host. The gentleman had such an attitude and didn't want to seat us because one member of our party wasn't there, even though we wanted to order drinks and appetizers in the meantime (we were absolutely ravenous). We finally convinced him to seat us. The hostess was nice though and made up for it somewhat although she did mess up my order. I wanted to get fatty tuna sashimi style and 2 salmon sushi style but it came out reversed which was annoying but not annoying enough to warrant sending it back (again, super hungry). Their pork bao buns were not at all what I expected (the pork was baked into a pastry type bun rather than being a large sliver or pork in a taco-style bun like literally every other place serves). Lastly, I tried a piece of my coworkers sushi and for the price, it was absolutely unremarkable. There was no noticeable flavor profile and it lacked a much needed texture. Only thing I can say was good was the edamame and the decor (although rather dark). Perhaps the nightclub is more worth it",

Great as you get to try more things! Between 4 of us, we ordered 3 appetizers / dim sum to share. Then for entree we shared Kobe steak, miso glazed sea bass, pad Thai noodles and Chinese sausage fried rice. It was all incredible! The staff were friendly and happy to help with recommendations and knew the menu very well. The music was good and this restaurant is inside the Venetian, so great to check out the casino and gondolas before or after dinner. Tao is higher end in price, but it's worth it!",

The atmosphere has a reputation on its own, the servers are over the top amazing, and the food can hold its own as well. We were balling out, so we told our server to surprise us and she pulled out all of Tao's best appetizers and dishes. I remember the tuna truffle appetizer specifically. All of their entrees were phenomenal, I could not even pinpoint a specific favorite. She was over the top cheery and was professional. If it is one of your first times in Vegas, there are AMAZING restaurants from all over the world... But you have to go to Tao because it is worth your time and money and it is one of the most iconic restaurants in Vegas. Once you are a seasoned veteran then other restaurants can come to fruition, but Tao needs to be done at some point.",

Wasabi was non existent  Filet Mignon was small and bland  Tempura of Onion Rings where flavorles Lo Mein was equal to Panda Express   Don't waste your time go to China Town in Las Vegas for real and quality Asian food of all types.

The service wasn't good... the waitress never smiled at us and wasn't attentive.  I didn't say anything about it during the whole meal, but when I was about to write in the tip, my friend said, \"she was kind of a bitch,\" which gave me confirmation that I was right.   As for the food... tempura avocado was good.. the sea bass skewer was alright, but a little sweet and too small to be worth the price.. the satay chicken was good (peanut sauce was excellent).. the orange chicken was alright.. and the Wasabi crusted filet had NO flavor... NONE!  We actually had to ask for salt.  The texture was good, but the wasabi crust tasted like air and the meat just tasted like plain meat.  The onion rings had a nice tempura batter, but the onions were thick, cold, and strong.  Shocking part... I ordered a Coke.. it came in a small glass with lots of ice, so it was literally 2 swallows!!  I  asked for a refill.  When the bill came, I was charged $4 for EACH Coke.  Are you fucking kidding me??  $8 for 4 swallows of soda?!?!  So whatever..  $133 for 2 small entrees, 3 appetizers, and 4 swallows of Coke.  I tipped just under 15% due to her being a bitch... sooo, $153 total.  Not worth it at all and I'll warn others to not go.  :(",

They will make sure dinner is complete and make sure you don't wait long for either drinks or your meal.  Very friendly, and very attentive.  Second, the food is among the finest anywhere.  Yes, it's Chinese - and the menu names suggest you can order this from your local carry-out.  But be warned...you cannot.  The food here tastes on a whole new level.  From the ingredients to the spices, they do not get lazy.  The best is the desserts!  Who would have thought you could order amazing desserts from a Chinese restaurant?  Visit one time and you will know.   I can't wait to come back in March!!",

We made reservations and we had no problems getting in on a friday night (even with reservations some end up waiting)  Half of us went towards the towards the Noodle dishes the other half got rolls. Personally I don't think its worth getting rolls The Lo Mien was bad ass the Pad Thai was unlike any other i have tried we loved it.  We had the Sweet potato tempura as the appetizer it was nice. The drinks however were not. the Tao-tini (I had to go there wanted something lighter) was just bad another person in our party got the lemon grass something and he didn't like that much either. The prices are so fair its ridiculous. Noodles ranging from 14-20 dollars. The Desert was sexy we got a big fortune cookie stuffed with Chocolate cream on one side and vanilla cream on the other It was hot. The best part is we got comp admission to tao night club and didn't even have to wait in line and honestly admission alone would have been the price of our tab. Tao is defiantly a Must!",

The restaurant was located on the second floor. The night club was closed that day however they still had soft music and people dancing on the 2nd Floor of the restaurant. The waitress was nice and once your drink runs low someone from no where comes to refill it. The food did taste like really good Asian Thai food just very fresh and a good amount. Pretty pricey but worth it. I ordered the coconut shrimps they was really big and thickly breaded couldn't finish it all. My bf ordered the Mango Chicken. We also shared  Shrimp Tai Fried Rice. We are heavy eaters but we got full fast. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be eating from here again and exploring the menu. We also order some beef which was that nights special. Don't remember the name of it but I loved it, my bf thought it wasn't cooked good. They did however leave some pieces of fat on it.",

My boyfriend got the Thai peanut sauce shrimp & it was AMAZING. Light, delicate, spicy, lemongrass....i still dream of it!! We also split tempura scallops which was $10 for 2 (our waiter kindly advised us) & delicious.  Our friends also loved their food, including sushi rolls. People devoured the short ribs.  Our waiter communicated well with us as the sushi was made in one spot & other food in the kitchen. The waiter felt the ribs wouldn't be enough for 2 people but our friends got stuffed & ended up sharing.  We also got a free desert (with naughty fortunes) for our friends birthday.  Everyone was SHOCKED by how much we actually paid - it seemed so little for the quality!!!  PROS: Selection, food, waitstaff, speed, decor CONS: the guys next to us trying to hit on every girl that would sit down.  PROTIP: apparently the bathrooms aren't labeled....",

Their vegetable bamboo dumplings were pretty decent if you are looking for something simple and vegetarian. The Peking Duck was nothing special. The wrapper that came were very disappointing: too dry like they were left out in the air for a while. I liked the coconut shrimp, but it was a bit too sweet. Chicken with Bakchoy was very boring. It wasn't tender or flavorful. Again, I love the ambiance, it was designed with taste and thought. It's more of a place for drinks and little appetizers.",

We started with the lobster wontons in a shiitake ginger broth and the satay of Chilean sea bass that was coated in miso and came with large crisp asparagus. These were both incredible. We ended up ordering a second of the sea bass skewers as they were flaky, moist and sweet.   For dinner we shared the udon vegetable noodles, the salmon sashimi with avocado and the New York steak with a peppercorn sauce and veggies. Everything was top notch ingredients, and really flavorful. We ended up ordering some sort of crab roll at the end and that was the worst thing we had, otherwise each dish was really wonderful. I'd definitely come here for a fun dinner in Vegas again.",

Although I had to wait a tad bit long to get my order taken and for my bill, I still felt like a priority to my waitress.   She took into account my dietary restrictions, asked the kitchen for details on specific ingredients, and made THE BEST menu suggestions!  Food: Wow! Their menu, a compilation of Chinese, Japanese and Thai food, is sure to impress. Try the Chilean Sea Bass (sweet, buttery and soft fish atop a bed of flavorful, sauteed veggies) and the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll with rice paper.  I also ordered the Drunken Lobster Pad Thai (which was lacking sauce and flavor and didn't live up to its name).",

Seven of us ladies dined here on Saturday and got the $55/ person pre fixe menu.  We were able to substitute some items.    Edamame - Nice way to start out.  Roasted Shishito Peppers with Yuzu - I loved that garlic sauce.  Alaskan Salmon, Crab, and Avocado Roll -  Perfect little bite.  Salmon Sashimi with Avocado, Crispy Onions, Sweet and Spicy Sesame Sauce - Heavenly.  One of my favorite dishes.  Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs - So tender and packed with salty flavor.  Lobster ravioli - I loved the texture of this velvety dumpling and the mushrooms.  Crispy Coconut Shrimp with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce - My least favorite dish.  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables - Another favorite dish.  The fish was so buttery and fatty and moist.  Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork - Really good!  Crispy Orange Chicken - I was impressed!  This was no Panda Express orange chicken!  Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings - Wow!  Such tender meat and that crust was like tempura.    Yuzu Sugar Dusted Doughnuts - The caramel was my favorite dipping sauce.  This was the perfect amount of food for seven of us girls.  Our server, bussers, and food runners made a really smooth dining experience.  They were on it.  My server ran over when he saw me looking around fondling my empty martini glass.  Ladies, you can get into Tao nightclub free after you dine.  Get a free drink wrist band good until 11:30 PM upstairs.  Make sure you make a reservation and put your name on the guest list 24 hours prior to partying.  They print out their lists ahead of time so you can't do it the day of.",

    "text": "Tao is often overlooked when one thinks of dining in Vegas, but give it a chance - you will be pleasantly surprised! I like to take my out-of-town guests here for a one-stop dinner/club experience and we always have an amazing meal and an amazing time.  I have pretty much tried everything on the menu at this point and I've never had a dish I didn't like. There are two dishes that I adore and frequently re-order: (warning, I get pretty cheesy about the following dishes)   The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass *Located in the \"From The Sea\" section of the menu  Oh my gosh, the sea bass.... This would very likely be my last meal on Earth! The sea bass is usually prepared to the perfect melt-in-your mouth consistency with a subtle miso glaze that delicately balances the flavor of the fish. On a few occasions it came out slightly overdone and they happily sent out another one.  Salmon Sashimi with Avocado, Crispy Onions *Located in the \"Special Dishes\" section of the menu  This is one of those genius dishes that seems so simple until you take that first magical bite. The combination of texture and flavor is mind-blowing. The salmon sashimi, avocado, and sweet and spicy sesame sauce flavors with just a hint of crispy onions brilliantly balance each other like like a symphony of flavors in your mouth!   After you finish your incredible meal, Tao will send you off with a naughty little fortune cookie. And if you're lucky, maybe it will come True ;) Hey, it's Vegas!  So do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have a night of clubbing ahead, you can usually get escorted into the nightclub upstairs from your table.  Tip: If you're just a small party of 2-3 and they don't have any reservations available at the time you want, you can usually just head back to the sushi bar and get a seat right away.",

My bf and I decided to dine here during my stay in Vegas for CES 2010. We had to wait for our table even though we had made reservations, so we went to the bar and I had a mojito while we sat in that crowded area. We were seated in 15 minutes. The place is very asian and sexy...but kinda crowded. We had lobster crab cakes & wontons as appetizers. For our main course we had this huge spicy lobster, prawns and scallops in black bean sauce. Food was decent, service was okay as well. I probably wouldn't go back here unless it was for someone's birthday or something.",

We had the Chilean Sea Bass skewers to start, and we nearly fought each other for the right to eat more than our one skewer share. It was heaven. Then we shared the Wagyu beef entree and the sausage fried rice - both were truly excellent. The beef was fork tender and perfectly cooked medium rare.

It was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. Not that big of a deal really. -My husband had the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon w/ Onion Rings. He was pretty disappointed. I felt bad bc I had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.  The Pros: -My dish alone is the reason I would go back to Tao and the reason I gave it 4 stars... the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was outstanding! Best fish I've ever eaten. Just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter.   Somewhere in the Middle: -For an app. we had the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice- good, not great. I was hoping it would taste like a similar dish I had once at Katsuya in Hollywood and it just didn't stack up.   Will we be going back? Doubtful. Maybe if I go to Vegas with some girlfriends in the future I'll have a chance to eat some more of that delicious fish, but I will not likely be going back with the husband.",

    "text": "I've been to Tao Las Vegas twice, and both experiences are in the top 5 best meals I've ever had.   I think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything.   First off all, we had incredible service. There were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. His manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of Perrier-Jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass.   Our server (I can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. All in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. It felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. Highlights included:  - Satay of Chilean sea bass with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. Melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful.   - Spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice  - Crispy spicy tuna roll with avocado and soy paper - probably the best sushi I've ever tasted  - Lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour  In addition to the wonderful food and service, Tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. Bonus is that you get free entry to Tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun).   Would highly recommend Tao for dinner!",

I shared the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, sea-bass, fried rice, and salmon with udon noodles.  The rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  The sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the filet mignon hit the spot.  We had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  I'm a huge fan of the decor of Tao nightclub, and can say the same holds True with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)    The servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got VIP stamps to get into the club.  And I'm not talking about \"VIP\" status where you get into a \"VIP\" line and wait another f-ing hour.  At 10PM we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  Considering I spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what I think anyone would call a good deal.  If you're going to come and complain about the \"noise level\" take a pause and think about it.  What do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).  The only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in Vegas have the same place ..Tao and Tao.  Nightclub and restaurant.",

However, Tao in the Venetian in Las Vegas was nothing short of a major disappointment. Our dinner consisted of two people, one drink each, two apps, two entres (I had the wasabi Filet Mignon) and one dessert. Tab with tip was just short of $180.  The service was exceptional as expected but the food, our primary reason for booking this visit, was just average. I would suggest RA as I have eaten there a number of times and it never disappoints.",

    "text": "I'm quite picky about restaurants and don't give out 5 stars easily, however I do feel like based on my personal experience, that this place warrants it.  We had reservations for dinner here although we knew that despite having reservations there would be a bit of a wait. We sat in the nice lounge and looked over the drink menu until the hostess led us to our table.  We had a nice booth on the left hand side of the large Buddha that dominates the room. I definitely liked the decor (although it does take some getting used to the dim lighting).  DRINK RECOMMENDATION:  I love the Tiger Lilly...Ketel One Vodka, Chambord, and Pinapple Juice. The Tao Love Potion # 9 is also supposed to be a big hit.  To start, I ordered the Kobe Tartare Tempura, which was absolutely amazing. First, make sure to note that appetizer portions (at least where our meals were concerned) were huge, and I was pretty much full after it. The flavors were so bold and exciting and it was an amazing start to my dinner.  For my main course I had the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. It seemed to be what most people recommended you order.  I do not like seafood in general, but when you go to places such as Tao, which are known for it, then you have to just trust that it will help with your misconceptions. And it really did. The sea bass was amazing...very light, flavorful, and not fishy at all. It was perfectly cooked on a bed of vegetables and had a very nice flavor profile.  Sadly, I couldn't even finish it!  For dessert...I believe it's an off the menu thing...but the Giant Fortune Cookie is a must. Depending on the number of your party, they'll put the appropriate amount of fortunes in it...most of them being sexual in nature and quite funny!  After dinner, we waited for the manager to arrive so that we could get our hand stamped in order to get into Tao Nightclub without waiting in line.  All in all a great meal with some amazing food and flavor profiles!  P.S. The bathroom is definitely interesting. While washing your hands, make note if you look at the gaps between the mirror and the sink, you can peer into the men's restroom and even see men standing by the urinals. It was so random yet funny at the same time. ;)",

    "text": "They may say Tao is meant to be a spiritual dining experience, but after our terrible night there I was closer to wrathful sin than enlightenment.   I made a reservation at Tao for the second anniversary of the first date I had with my girlfriend. We came all the way to Vegas from San Diego, and we were curious about Tao's because of the interesting decor etc.   Quite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. Our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. He was large, Caucasian, and messy haired (I only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. I have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. He didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just FYI took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. He checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. When we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what I assume was an earpiece. Not subtle at all... My girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). Either way she walked straight out. I however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. He responded with \"Oh its just... Nothing...\" and looked away. Very nice, Tao... Treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies...   But that aside on to the restaurant itself.   The atmosphere at Tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. Clumsy Asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant Buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set.   Unfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. We had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. I wish I had a better memory for names because if I could single him out for the managers I'd say he deserved a promotion.  Our actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if I'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... In his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say \"Hi\", just \"So what can I get for you folks tonight\"...   The food itself was well... okay... I mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. Just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. I had the Crispy Thai Pork which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had Spicy Chicken which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. So the food was a bit of a let down too.   They were also out of most of my favorite beers, Tiger, Sapporo etc. so I settled for a warm Kirin out of the bottle. Not much to say other than well, warm beer.   All in all I sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in Vegas. Tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. Do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.  Boy I wish we had just ordered Room Service...",

He didn't, ask questions, never came to check on drinks even when he was right there. I am a reasonable person. If it was so busy and he was working very hard, I'd understand. Since he had enough time to stand at the back and observe, I would think he could make himself useful and at least refill our drinks. This is Vegas people, many, many, many better options. Do not waste your time or money on this place. There were three of us, no one liked their meals. It is also very loud, as it is part of a night club -- I didn't mind this part -- that was actually the fun part. What I didn't appreciate was where I was seated. They seated us at the back where the staff kept going in and out from, with dishes et al -- and every time someone would pass, most likely would knock into me. The rudest part was no one -- not even one person there apologized for doing so.    I am disappointed as after reading the reviews people have received good to decent service -- not in our case.  Yikes, save yourself the trouble and drop your dime elsewhere. Way, way better options available.",

Dear Angela, you are a fantastic bartender/server! Thank you for making our experience at Tao Bistro amazing!   Anywho onto my review of the food.  Chilean Sea Bass (small plate):  Absolutely mouth watering. Full of bold flavour and can easily make you want more! This sea bass is so flaky and since its done right succulent as well. If you've never been into seafood this dish will definitely make you a believer that yes those swimmers in the deep blue are definitely worth snatching up and being prepared under Tao Bistros watchful eye.  Get It!  Chinese Sausage Fried Rice:  I was a little wary of this dish just because Chinese sausage has always kind of put me off. Why I guess it's always been a little funky but whatever I figured since it was so highly recommended we'd give it a shot. Topped off with a fried egg we mixed our little rice dish together and well it was simply delicious. The rice for me was a little overcooked but with the flavors that were put in place to make this little side dish so stunning I looked passed it easily. Once again Tao bistro serves up full blown flavour with this dish.   Tao Bistro definitely stands by that go big or go home ideal with its choices in flavour s used in their dishes. A respectable trait in a restaurant.  If you're in Las Vegas make you're way over to Tao you definitely won't be disappointed.",

One thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make reservations. We went here on a Monday night at 9:30 p.m. thinking we would get seated right away. Apparently not. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we didn't have reservations. The wait ended up being an hour but luckily we were staying at the Palazzo so we went back up to the room for some drinks to kill some time.   We ordered the sea bass (amazing), the coconut shrimp and udon noodles. The shrimp was really crispy and the sauce on it was so good. The udon noodles were whatever. I don't really like udon noodles in general so i can't really give an honest opinion.  We tried their sake sampler but I realized that I'm not a sake fan. It's too strong. Their mixed drinks are pretty good though.   Since we came here on a Monday, the club was closed. I'd imagine that when the club is open it could get pretty loud. There was music playing but I don't remember it being overbearing.   If you're looking for some where to eat in Vegas I'd recommend this place for sure.",

As for drinks, I am not a martini fan in general, but I make an exception at Tao. I will usually have a lychee martini here, and it is expensive like everything, but again reallllllllllly tasty. I have also tried the Tao-tini and one other drink, and they were both tasty as well.  For dessert, Molten Chocolate Cake. Let me repeat that... Molten. Chocolate. Cake. Worth every last calorie consumed. Save room for dessert, which will be hard, but trust me on this one.  I have always received outstanding service here, and excellent food.",

    "text": "If you've ever been to any of the New York locations, the Vegas location will disappoint. The decor (for the most part) is just as lovely as any of the NY locations, however the photos of sumo wrestlers over the sushi station seem a bit out of place in an otherwise very upscale decor.   The service was great and our waiter was as nice as can be. He was enthusiastic about the food and very attentive.   Ambience: loud. The music in addition to the very load ambience was a bit too much.   Pad Thai was under par. My husband ordered spicy chicken dish with pineapple and peppers which was very tasty however the chicken was a bit over cooked. The pad Thai was overwhelmed with sprouts and coriander and served in a very annoying vessel which made it hard to eat.   Our fortune cookies tasted great but oddly?  had very sexual fortunes.  Overall ok. Didn't meet expectations compared to other locations.",

    "text": "The entrance of this place is beautiful when you walk in. Dark and swanky with big, plush red booths. An enormous Buddha statue in the center of the restaurant and an almost converted warehouse feel in the back feel a little disjointed from what you see when you first walk in, though.  The weird warehouse section is where two of my friends and I sat for dinner tonight. We tried the bubbly blueberry sake which I have to admit was not my idea, because seriously, that sounds *^%*# gross. However, I was really surprised by how delicious it was. Sweet and effervescent with no real sake taste at all. I was pleasantly surprised.  For dinner, I ordered two sushi rolls. The mountain spring roll was good but I do wish I would have been told it was served on a wasabi sauce before ordering. I also ordered the spicy lobster roll, which I would just rate as ok. The sushi here was decent, and definitely better than most of what I can find in my landlocked home state of Kansas, but I have to be honest when I say I've had much better sushi not only on the coast, but in even in Vegas.   For dessert one friend and I split the molten chocolate lava cake. The box you see in the picture is chocolate shell and when you break it away the molten cake inside is much smaller. The taste was good but nothing outstanding or memorable. The cake was served with a salted caramel ice cream which was super salty. I stopped after one bite but my friend finished the rest, so it might just be an acquired taste.  The wait staff was attentive and the water glasses were kept filled. My major complaint was that we were sat by the entrance to the kitchen and my chair was repeatedly bumped into and hit by servers walking by. This was really distracting and even caused my purse to fall off the chair and hit the floor twice, so I kept having to bend over and pick it up again. For this level of meal and this level of restaurant, I would expect to not have endured that distraction.  I've heard a lot about Tao so I'm really glad I tried it out, but with all of the other great options in Vegas to choose from, I'm unlikely to return.",

We checked in for our reservation time but it took another 45 minutes or so to be seated even though we had reservations. We sat at the lounge and waited.   Finally we were seated at a table of 8 and were served. We ended up doing the family style dining which was about $75 USD per person. We thought this would be the best way to taste as many different types of food.   Each of the dishes were quite exotic and very tasty. The service was great. They served most of the dishes at once and continued to clear the table as plates were emptied. It felt like they weren't going to stop serving us. There was so much food. The variety of the food was sufficient - dishes from the land, from the sky, from the sea (ie. meat, veggies, seafood).  They offered us free entry to the TAO nightclub because we were pretty big spenders that evening. Food and service was awesome. Ambiance was a little dark and the wait was a little disappointing despite the reservation.   But overall a great place to go.",

That was definitely a bummer. Other than that the waitress and bussers provided us with excellent service. The food was nothing special, we ordered a little bit of everything and nothing was my liking. The lobster pad Thai that is very popular here wasn't good and neither was the spring mountain roll I ordered. I only seemed to like the rock shrimp lettuce cups. I ordered the taotini and it was good but too strong for me. I don't think I'll be returning.",

From the giant Buddha statue in the center to the layout and decor of the overall restaurant, this is something that will satisfy any diner regardless of their past dining experiences anywhere else.  The food is absolutely amazing with portion sizes that are moderate in size and not small.  The menu was diverse and offered something for everyone.  I wasn't so sure of this spot at first as I was pretty hungry, but I left highly satisfied.    I ordered this fried coconut shrimp dish. It was an absolute delight and was more filling than I expected.   I did not expect so many shrimp and so I was both surprised and delighted at the portion size.  It was cooked well and good not have tasted better.    The decor of the restaurant was very tasteful and trendy.  This is an Asian fusion restaurant and so it was a fusion of Asian styling with modern trendiness.  This is a solid choice for any type of occasion, whether it be a date or just dinner with friends.  They even have booths near the front for more romantic types.    One final note about this spot was how amazing our waiter was.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the food and one of the friendliest servers I have ever had.  It was my birthday a few days before and he surprised my friend and I with a giant stuffed fortune cookie cake that contained chocolate and vanilla creams.   It had \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate and was on the house!   Quite a surprise to end the night.",

    "text": "When coming to Vegas I was SO looking forward to eating at TAO! I've heard so many great things and was super excited to finally experience it for myself! Upon entering I was very surprised to see that it was pretty empty. It's a rather dark restaurant with pretty good music and classic Asian decorations all around. I pretty cool atmosphere, really. My family was seated and our waitress came to us right away. We ordered drinks, appetizer, and sushi for dinner. Our food all took a bit long to come out. I would say the service was very average here. We stared with the crab cake appetizer which was absolutely amazing! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and very well-seasoned. Yum!  We were super excited for our sushi. We ordered a plate of sashimi as well as the crispy tuna roll, a yellowtail roll, and dragon (eel) roll. I'm so so sad to say that my family and I were not impressed by the meal at all. We were super hungry so we ate most of the sushi... but I personally found that it wasn't the quality that I was looking for. This is a place I've heard about for years and was soooooo excited to visit. I expected so much more! We told the waitress that we weren't satisfied and she brought out the manager who did not hesitate to take the 3 sushi rolls off our bill and bring us out another dish. We ordered the duck fried rice which was ALSO just super average... I hate to write a review like this about such a reputable place but I can't lie about how truly disappointed my family and I were. Perhaps it's not as good as it has been in the past? Gotta end on a positive note so I'm gonna praise the yummy chocolate fortune cookies with sexual fortunes/sayings in them. We all loved the fortune cookies, that's for sure! Hopefully the next person won't have the same experience as me. I'm hoping it was just a bad night and Tao is still the awesome place that I always heard it is!!",

It's definitely a place to been seen.    After hours, outside around the corner upstairs is a hopping club.  Ladies in bath-tubs and dancing on the speakers.  The music was a mix of hip-hop and techno.    My only issue was the ONE SINGLE bar for the entire club that's  a NO-NO. I don't like 20 people in front of  me trying to order drinks.  It took 30 mins, okay I'm not thirsty anymore.   Other than that, the restaurant was delicious and the club was awesome.  Until we meet again VEGAS!",

The Thai bath tubs at the entrance are very pretty except I didn't get why were they related to a restaurant. Also the bathroom has vending merchandise was not normal to me. They put statues here and there all the way led to the bathroom could be kinda spooky for some ppl.  Comes the food I was totally satisfied. With the material, texture, flavor and the price. Also the service was awesome too.  They put a whole lobster in the lobster pat thai noodle. That portion feed two to three ppl with other orders. My son loved the short ribs, they cooked them so soft and juicy. Other dishes we had were also good.   Definitely recommend this restaurant in Vegas.",

I had the Sea Bass and loved it!    Secondly: the decor is unique and elegant.  Dark and slightly mysterious.  Tables range from large round or rectangle for groups, small 2 tops, and a bar-type area surrounding a sushi prep area.   There is also a lot of lounge seating and a full bar.   Last:  this is a LOUD place.  If you want a romantic intimate quiet atmosphere you will not get it here.   That being said, everyone on the night I went was having fun and sharing a good time!  I assume it was a precursor to visiting the nightclub next door.",

We dined very early at 6pm, because we had been working at a convention all day, and were spent and knew we'd be in bed early.  Upon arrival, we found the atmosphere to be inviting ~ dark and mellow.  However, as the night progressed, this place got LOUD and energetic.    The food was fantastic.  We had lobster potstickers and roasted shishito peppers to start, and then shared the miso glazed sea bass and lobster kimchee fried rice.  We loved them all!   We did decide to indulge in dessert, and had the giant fortune cookie and molten chocolate cake.  Both were fine, but not necessarily worth the calories.  But, they were both beautiful presentations.   One note - the bathroom has an attendant.  I dislike this soooo much, since I never bring my purse or money to the restroom and quite frankly, can grab my own paper towel and dispense my own soap.  This was the only thing I didn't like about our experience, as I always feel guilty for not tipping because I was not prepared.",

I attended TAO with 4 other people and we ordered family style (really recommend, but if you don't do family style, prepare for leftovers).   We ordered the drunken lobster pad thai, an assortment of sushi and sashimi, angry dragon roll, spring mountain roll, and dumplings. I tried all of the food except for the dumplings as I am a pescatarian. We also got the mochi and the giant fortune cookie for dessert.  Our waiter was awesome except towards the end when we needed to get our check - that took forever and a day.  The pad thai was amazing - just wish that they had more lobster in it. It was only two claws and if everyone shared it it's not worth it. Sushi was the best sushi I've ever had in my life but the spring mountain roll -pass on it. Not worth for $25 a roll.  Lastly the giant fortune cookie is cool for pictures but in all reality it's just a fortune cookie that you probably won't even eat half of. Mochi was great except the red bean one but then again, I'm not a fan of red bean.",

We were a party of 6 and to not make things complicated opted for the \"family style\".   The food came out pretty quick and efficiently. Most of the food given for family style were delicious. Although some were very salty. The food that stood out the most to me were the Thai Chili chicken pop sticks and the Sea Bass sticks - so so good. Every one could not stop raving about it.   The prices are on the higher end at about $100-130 each to include drinks. TAO is a place to check out if you are bringing a date or dinner with close friends and family.  I will definitely be back here next time!",

    "text": "I was in town for a conference and saw the constant line of people waiting for this place so I decided to check it out.  I was able to make reservations for the next night for me and a colleague.  When we tried to stop in earlier than our reservation we weren't able to get seated until our reservation time; totally understandable.   Food: I ordered the sea bass and it was cooked well but there wasn't anything mind-blowing about the flavor.  For the price, I'm not sure I'd say it was worth it.    Staff: I can't remember our server or anything about them so I guess that's good.  No news is good news, right?   Location: This place gets CROWDED. They have a hot happy hour scene and a club entrance next door.  I imagine a lot of people stop in here for drinks before going to their club next door.  That combination makes this place extremely loud and crowded. It's not like you can hear the club next door or anything; it's just the amount of people hanging out for dinner and at the bar that makes you yell to your dinner guests if you want to hear anything.  I swear my voice went hoarse after dinner from all the yelling.",

So last night I got my chance to eat there and man, was it good!  The entrance to this place is just beautiful. You walk by tubs filled with rose petals and lit by candlelight, where the hostess is is backed by Buddha heads and a large replica of a Zen Garden. The whole place is covered with Buddhas and asian artwork.   We were sat in a corner booth. It was hard to read the menu due to the lack of lighting but that just added to the experience. (Just turn on flashlight mode on your phone.)  We started with the shishito peppers and a spicy tuna roll. The tuna roll was probably the best I've ever had. So good and loaded with flavor.   I got the Tao-tini for my drink. It has Malibu rum and fresh raspberries so it's sweet and fruity.   Dinner I got the peppered fillet mignon. It was sliced steak cooked with mixed vegetables. The steak was so tender I could cut it with my fork and the sauce it was mixed with was so flavorful.   Dessert. Mmmm. We ordered the lava cake. Trust me. Just order it. Unless you're one of those people who doesn't like chocolate (how do you live?) you're going to love it.  Plus it was presented beautifully.   Overall this was a great experience and worth the wait!!  The prices are Vegas prices but you definitely get what you pay for with this place.   Thank you Tao for exceeding my expectations!",

To be honest, I'm one of those cheap Asians who refuse to pay too much for Asian food and wouldn't come here voluntarily. Luckily, our friends (non-Asian) love this place and are super generous to invite us here. The place is decked out right when you first walk in with beautiful fountains full of flower petals, and a humongous Buddha statue inside.   Their menu is almost like a mini book. Sooooo many options to choose from and everything just sounds so good. We went with a few appetizers to share, an entree each, plus 2 desserts. What really stood out to me were the dumplings, orange chicken entree (surprisingly), and the lemongrass creme brulee. I'm a sucker for creme brulee and almost always have to get it every time I see it on the menu. Theirs is the biggest portion I have seen and possibly the best creme brulee I have had, not too sweet, creamy but not too thick, and paired perfectly well with the fruits plus the ice cream.   I would definitely come back here again at least just for that creme brulee. Besides that, wouldn't make it a habit when there are so many other great Asian restaurants not too far from the strip for sooo much cheaper.",

Everything is decorated with chic Asian-flare and with the pumping music from the club upstairs and lowly dimmed lights it really sets the mood for a fun and romantic night.   The front of the house staff could use a little advice from the back as they all seemed a little less than excited to be there, however. When we walked in a little early for our dinner reservation there was about 5-6 employees standing behind the desk all talking and not one greeted us. Ouch. We eventually caught their attention and were told we could wait by the bar for our table or walk around. We chose to walk around instead.   When we were seated at our table they sat us all the way in the back at the service entrance. Now having a reservation several weeks in advance this was a disappointment. Still I was determined to not let all of this deter our evening. Our waiter was so polite, fast and on point with everything that our mood was quickly lifted.   This place is fancy and expensive and you truly pay for the food and drinks because they were just the best I've had in Asian Cuisine ever. I had the Tao-tini followed by the Tao-mojito both delicious and beautifully served. We started out with the shrimp tempura sushi and this was hands down the best sushi I've ever had in my life. The rice was still warm and you could really taste how fresh everything was. We ended with the chicken Pad Thai which I also loved but would say they served a little heavy on the sprouts.   Overall our dining experience was pretty great and I can't wait to try the Tao in NYC. Definitely worth a stop if you're ever in Vegas.",

The portions for dinner were huge, enough for sharing and leftovers. The lychee martini was strong and tasty. This is a great place for birthdays since they bring out the huge fortune cookie! The ambiance is also a 10/10.   I ordered the lobster and kimchi fried rice and it was the best fried rice I've ever had. The combination of kimchi along with the huge chunks of lobster went together very well. My friend ordered the shrimp pad Thai, it was a little too sweet for me. For apps, we ordered the sea bass and crispy rice with spicy tuna...both made my mouth water!   Will I return here on my next trip to Las Vegas? ABSOLUTELY.",

When we finally did sit down, our waiter was not very helpful and seemed annoyed that he 1. had to help us and 2. we didn't take his recommendations upon ordering. We ended up ordering several small plates, dumplings and sushi. They brought out all our food at once -- and the sushi was NOT freshly made at all and had no flavor and kept falling apart. The only highlight of the meal was the fact we got into the TAO club upstairs for free. $107 later..... I think this place is extremely over-rated and not worth waiting on line for.",

    "text": "Tao Restaurant is a pretty nice place.  Really cool environment, good vibe, beautiful layout, etc, etc.  It's also not a bad thing that they don't seat you right away (even if you have reservations)....they have a nice lounge area.  If restaurants were all about the environment, then Tao would get 5 stars.  But alas, this is a review of a restaurant, so the actual food is important too.  Typical asian fusion stuff....a mix of a wide variety of asian dishes.  If you don't know what asian fusion is, think about it this way....you can order sashimi (Japanese), pad thai (thai), satay chicken for appetizers (thai), and then throw down some shrimp, sea bass, spicey tuna rolls, kung pao, etc.  Oh yeah, avoid the sashimi....we're talking 4 small leaflets worth for $60.  The food is decent, but nothing special.  The environment goes along way (great place to take your special someone or a bunch of friends)...but the food is nothing to rave about.  Remember, it's definitely on the pricey end.  If you're considering a few appetizers, some drinks, maybe a bottle of sake, an entree for you and your sweatie, and then some dessert to close the deal, we're talking $100 each, easily.  And please, please don't go here just to get a free line pass for Tao, the club.  It's not worth it.  Why pay $100 per person for a mediocre dinner just to get into the club?  And besides, if you're part of a sausage fest, you'll still have to pay cover and still wait a bit in line.  And if you cheap out on the dinner (where your main motivation was to get into the club and it's obvious), the server doesn't have to hook you up.  And once you're in, you're screwed because Tao is geared towards table service.....unless you enjoy being packed like sardines (well I suppose if there were two girls and you.....).  Anyways, think about it...$100 for dinner, $ for cover, and then a whole bunch of $ for drinks. ...and standing the whole time and being very uncomfortable.  Or spending $200-$250 each person for bottle/table service, depending on how many are in your group.  It's a no brainer.  So back to the Tao restaurant....great environment good vibe, cool place to eat......average food.",

The only good thing I can say about this place is that their lounge makes sick drinks (kudos to the Tao Love Potion concoction!) and their bartenders are really nice. Other than this their bouncer need a freakin reality check. You're a bouncer. You prob got let out of prison 3 months ago and it's only a matter of time until you go back. I'm dropping 200+ on dinner so do me a favor and check with  your manager before you tell me that I have to wait in line to get into your club which was also one of the WORST I have been to in Vegas.

We had 9 pm dinner reservations, and we weren't seated until 11.  Plus one star for comping us a free round of drinks, no small feat when there were 16 of us, and a round of appetizers, but only one because the food took an hour to arrive and was lukewarm and when it did, not to mention uber salty.  The quality was low - anyone who says it's any good obviously hasn't had any Chinese food that's any better than P.F. Chang's.  The only reason to have dinner here is to avoid the line for the club, but when you've got a bachelorette party totaling 16 chicks, there is really no need to wait in line anywhere, or pay any cover charges.  I suspect the reason why we wound up here (and many of the other dining patrons) is because this place was featured on the Kardashians.  Go figure. :P",

Then we moved on to the pepper filet udon noodles which were a more flavorful lo mein and the XO shrimp with extra spice which had green beans, shrimp, rice all in a spicy, bean sauce.  The shrimp dish was the best Asian dish I have ever eaten.  For dessert, we went with the donuts with the dipping sauce which were a great finish to a great meal.  Great, knowledgeable and helpful service.",

    "text": "Good food, good service, good atmosphere. Nice place to come if you're craving Asian fusion or are celebrating something special. I do recommend you come with a fair amount of people so you'll be able to sample a little of everything as it is family style portions. Items that stood out for me on the menu were the sea bass, shitake mushrooms, and udon noodles. Lots of mushroom which I like and you can taste a hint of the sake they used in it. The sea bass was very fresh, tender, a bit fishy though so if you don't like the fish taste, I wouldn't recommend it. And last but not least, the filet mignon was nicely peppered, grilled, and complimented the udon noodles well. All the other stuff we ordered like pad thai, kung pao chicken, or the lobster wonton didn't excite my taste buds. The kung pao chicken had more vegetables then it did chicken. Boo. The pad thai was dry and not enough sauce, also I found it odd to serve a Thai dish at a Chinese fusion restaurant. The lobster wonton were mediocre. Would have been better if they were smaller or maybe fried. They had too much filling and were soggy. The little fortune cookies they give you at the end are kind of fun. They're chocolate cookies with your not so everyday fortunes :) Service was amazingly fast, 3.5 stars for you Tao!",

I've been to the one in NY and it was fantastic, considering I was at the one in NY for a sorority Centennial dinner and everything was  organized into a pre-fixe menu.. However, def. no comparison to NY and no comparison to NOBU which is why it lacks the 5th star.  Other than that, I had a bunch of assorted appetizers rather than meals, kind of tapas style.  Everything was fresh.  Their wait staff was terrific.  I had their Earthy Sake, hot it was fantastic.  Def. warmed me up considering Vegas was FREEZING when I went. I'll be back in the future for their nightclub scene.  I'm curious to see what they have to offer.",

    "text": "to be honest, i actually loved this asian fusion restaurant. and normally, i'm not down with places where there's more caucasian people than asians. but tao is totally an exception. our party of 14 had reservations at 8:15 on a saturday night, and we got seated exactly at 8:15 (give or take a couple minutes). we had to get 2 tables, but our waitress was fabulous! she was sooo nice, i was expecting her to be sort of snobby because well, it's tao. i ordered the xo shrimp with rice and long beans (beware, some items don't include sides such as rice and veggies. ask the waitress/waiter which ones do). it was FANTASTIC. the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the beans were so tasty. the rice was also cooked well, something i didn't expect, since it's so americanized at tao. boyfriend ordered the salmon with udon noodles. holy cow! i wish i'd ordered that, too! (not instead, but TOO!). luckily, he always has a small appetite, so we got to share!  perfectly cooked salmon, too. not dry at all, or bland. from what my brother said, the shabu shabu was also really yummy, and the broth that it's cooked in is nicely flavored.  not only was the food great, the service was incredible. people kept asking us if we were enjoying ourselves, and our waitress and waiter were not rude one bit, which made my cousin's 30th birthday so special for her. they recommended the dessert sampler, $65 for a variety of desserts (a HUGE fortune cookie, chocolate mousses, molten lava cake) and they stuck a sparkler in there so we can sing happy birthday to her. she loved it! and it fed all 14 of us. the desserts are fabulous! our party spent $845 a good amount of food, a couple bottles of sake, and a bottle of wine. not bad at all, in my opinion. i will for sure be there the next time i'm in vegas!",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner here with friends on Saturday night and came away a bit underwhelmed.  By no means was the food bad, it very tasty, mostly what soured my view of the establishment was the overly loud music. I realize it converts to a club at night, however not being able to hear someone across the table unless they speak loudly and I lean in does not make for an enjoyable dining experience.  I was also a bit disappointed that I was steered away from ordering the orange chicken by my waitress. I don't consider myself someone who enjoys very spicy food, and when I ordered it our waitress asked if I liked my food spicy. I explained I do like some spice, but not large amounts of it. She then told me I might be better off ordering something else. Not wanting to ruin dinner with friends by not eating my meal I opted to order the filet mignon with udon noodles. While I enjoyed the flavor of the filet with udon I was disappointed in two regards. Firstly the amount of filet mignon with the noodles was pitiful, I had maybe 3 oz of meat total in my meal I think. Secondly, the sauce with udon noodles was tossed in was pretty average, I think I've had the same sauce in a meal at Noodles & Co.  To top it off, my friend ordered the orange chicken despite our waitress' warning and found that it wasn't nearly as spicy as the waitress made it out to be.  Despite hearing how great some of the desserts here were, we decided to skip it and go elsewhere so that we could actually hold a conversation without shouting.",

We went as a group of 4 on a Tuesday, with reservations at 7pm and it wasn't crowded, so we had the server all to our self.  When we left about an hour later, it was absolutely packed and the servers were running around from table to table.  So, go early and enjoy yourself!  The food is awesome and the ambience is even better.  Not sure what you want?!  Your waiter will defintely help you make a decision.  For vegetarians, they can replace the meat with tofu on most dishes (although, you'll still pay the meat price), so you have plenty of options.  For dessert, defintely get the jumbo fortune cookie!  The prices are a tad high, but you defintely won't leave the place starving.",

Thankfully, they more than made up for it when we were there.  I took the advice of our server and passed on the Ahi for the Chilean Sea Bass.  That saying, \"melts in your mouth\" was True in this case.  The spices complimented the fish, and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Each bite was ecstasy.  That's really the only way to describe it.  And as embarrassing at it is, there were moments where I literally closed my eyes to fully enjoy it (and so did the other girl that ordered it!).  I had a bite of someone's sushi roll as well, which was also incredible; so fresh, and uh, last time I checked, Las Vegas is pretty inland, so... wow. Someone else ordered the Miso-glazed Salmon, and raved about that as well.  Lobster wontons, probably not the best choice, opt for something different.  Definitely trust what your server has to say... you can't possibly go wrong!",

From the rose-pedal baths to the giant Buddha and wall of antique opium pipes, the whole place just feels like a place you'd want to be seen in. As far as sushi goes, the rolls left a lot to be desired, especially at the prices they were fetching for them.  At 30 dollars for their most expensive roll, I would have expected a little more.  However, the nigiri was pretty good, and they had some of the best toro (fatty tuna) I think I've ever had.  Then again, I've never really met a piece of toro I didn't like.   So, it would be a cool place to go, but not the best sushi I've ever had.  Definitely a place to see and be seen, so dress accordingly.",

We had to fill our wines a few times, didn't try any of the cocktails.  The wine list is fairly extensive with many options from relatively cheap (Vegas standards) to high end stuff.  (wines by the glass, not so extensive)  I ordered the pepper steak w/ udon noodles.  It was nice, although I expected more pepper for a pepper steak.  The noodles were done well and the sauce was tasty.  Overall, it was a nice dish, the problem was it's not worth the $30 they charge.  I get that this is Vegas, but there are better restaurants for that price within the Venetian.  Ambience was cool, the buddha is big, the bathrooms say yin and yang, so I walked into the wrong bathroom not knowing yin means women in some kind of Asian language.  I like the electronica playing and it was never overly loud, although we were there early.  The fortune cookies are very wise as well.  Mine read like this, \"Sex is the most beautiful, natural, and wholesome thing that money can buy.\"  I should give them four stars just for the fortune.  There are better options for food, but if you want a hipster joint with decent food, this may be your spot.",

    "text": "I've done 22 reviews so far, and have not yet given a 5-star.  In thinking about the best experience that I've had in a restaurant recently, I'd have to say Tao in Las Vegas.  The combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes Tao Las Vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  Of course, the Vegas excitement adds to the total experience.  This isn't one of Yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in Vegas based on the ratings, so I'll share a couple of tips of what I've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:  - Making reservations here is a must!  Without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (If you do, try $20 or higher)  - Come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  Meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.  - Once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the Edamame, Satay Chicken, or  Thai Stuffed Shrimps.  - If you like Sake, they have a pretty good selection of Sakes.  If you haven't tried the Nigori Sake (unfiltered), I'd suggest at least trying that.  The best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.We had the Voice in the Mist bottle and it was yummy!  - For your entree, you MUST get Miso-Glazed Chilean Seabass!!  It's my favorite fish entree in the world!  Savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  It definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  So good!  My friend likes the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, but I think it's not nearly as good as the Seabass.  I've been to Tao now for 3 years.  I've had a great experience every single time.  I now cannot imagine going to Vegas without my Chilean Seabass experience at Tao.",

Located inside the Venetian, which already smells great, the entrance and gift shop have the wonderful smell of sandalwood. The stone \"baths\" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time I've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. I've heard mention that there may be events where Buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. Either way, I wish I was a Tao bath girl....   But I digress...back to the food. Whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. Dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the Buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large Buddha statues abound. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction.   The sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the \"chef's special\". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in Vegas. You give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. The sashimi of Kobe beef (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate).   Peking duck eggrolls, Sea Bass meal or satay small plate, scallops...you could spend forever savoring. The sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason I have never gotten to desert. But then again, there are great places within the Venetian to venture to for liquid desert!  If you like Asian food or sushi it's a must visit for the food and the atmosphere.  And no, the swanky couches in the front room are not for the uncool to lounge upon and think they can order drinks from - bottle service only and all that goes with it!",

It is a bit pricey, but oh well - it's Vegas.  Made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and got seated pretty quickly (there were only 2 of us)  Crispy tuna sashimi roll - inventive and different, but just ok in my book Lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth - yum, v. good, would get this again Wok seared NY sirloin - good sized portion, nicely cooked meat, the sauce and mushrooms were very flavorful TAO lo mein - really big portion, v. yummy but was your typical lo mein from any chinese restaurant  Before we left we got a stamp on our wrist that said \"Line Pass\".  We went back to our hotel to relax for a bit and then went to TAO a bit later and got in no problem.",

First strike against them.  The drinks were good and not much pricier than most places in Atlanta. The food was also good, but a bit overpriced. My spicy shrimp was excellent and my friend seemed to enjoy her meal. I just felt like paying $18 for about 7 shrimp and not much else was too much.  It was good place to people watch and the staff was generally friendly. If you don't mind spending more money on roughly the same quality as a PF Chang's (and you want a break on the cover charge to the club) then it's probably not a bad choice at all.",

Good food - Check (I highly recommend the sake-infused mushrooms; the yellow-tail roll with fried scallions; the roasted shisito peppers; and the spicy tuna tartare atop crispy rice)   Good drink - Check (if you're in the mood to experiment, the mango tamarind martini's fabulous).   Good service - Check.   All in all, a great place to have a night special on the Strip..... but get ready to shell out some pretty pennies 'cause this place ain't cheap!",

In a town filled with meat, this was a great place to get a vegetarian meal. You are usually in pretty good shape with asian food, but the abundance of fish and steak on the menu made me worry at first!  WHAT WE GOT  Veggie Spring Rolls Veggie Dumplings Kung Pao Chicken as Kung Pao tofu :)  Sweet Potato, Japanese Eggplant and Avocado Tempura  Root of Innocence Sake (YUM!)  The wine list is immense and great, but the sake was a better deal :)  I personally recommend the avocado tempura!! I had never had avocado tempura before and these BIG yummy chunks are a great treat!",

    "text": "Walking into a club to have dinner wasn't something on the top of my list of things to do but I heard many good things, so in I went. Red accents along a dark backdrop. A hallway full of naked women in bathtubs covered in rose petals. Winding maze to get from the hallways to the upstairs dining area. Plenty of bouncers to ensure eating privacy. All seemed fairly crazy to me at a place we were to have dinner but It was well worth it.  The Tao restaurant had some of the most delicious salmon I've ever had. I ordered the soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach. The salmon cooked to perfection, beautifully medium in the middle, and the udon was amazing. Every morsel, every bite, and every scent was packed full of flavor. The seasoning enhanced the flavor of the salmon rather than masking it.  I eat a lot of Asian food, not because I'm Asian myself but because there is an abundant amount of Asian restaurants in my area. I wouldn't say the food at Tao is authentic but it is a warm welcome to to the culinary world with Asian influences.  Overall, It was the best salmon I've ever had and definitely worth the price and I would definitely return. Next time I'm bringing my appetite and dancing shoes as the club is amazing.",

The foods okk, ive had better asian cuisine. its over priced, they charge $5 for a piece of sushi which is unbelievable.

(We'd tried to get one, but were told the earliest possible was 11pm).  The host was great and said he could get us a table in 20 to 30 minutes (yes, we were looking our gorgeous best that night).  Turned out to be about 45 minutes, but was happy to wait since we grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine, and snacked on the wasabi-coated edamame, which were so very tasty.    After our buzzer went off, we were seated at a perfect little corner table.  Would have been perfect for a date, but alas, it was just my girl friend and I.  Not that I mind. Ninety-nine percent of the time I'd rather be with her than a date, anyway.  Beautiful, opulent decor.  Our server was very friendly.  Recommended a half bottle of wine when we were both ordering a glass, which gave us more bang for the buck.  We shared the chicken dumplings (fine), the crabcake appetizer special (so, so good), and the wasabi filet mignon with onion rings (tasty and perfectly cooked).   Overall, a good experience. Plus we got front of the line passes for the club. Definitely tops it off nicely.",

We had made reservations that morning and was able to get a reservation with no problems.... we ended up showing up an hour earlier than our reserved time, dunno how that happened and why ... but i guess in vegas ALL people lose track of time... i guess we were too excited to just stay in the room...... any hoot, we show up and we were able to get seated 45 mins earlier than our reservation. We were totally surprised and delighted at the same time. This was my first time to the restaurant part... and honestly wasn't expecting much to begin with, based on all the negative things that i've heard about the food and the service.   But honestly.... i had a great time.  The ambiance was nice, i could've gone for lowering the volume to hear my friend sitting across from me, but i didn't mind yelling. =P The food was absolutely delicious. We had all ordered fish ~~~ there was the Miso Glazed Chilean Bass, Soy-ginger glazed Salmon, and the Yellowfin Tuna. All were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes.    Service was decent for what it was worth. The place was crazy busy and we had plenty of libations at our table so we didn't really notice any lack of service... we were enjoying each others complany wayyyy too much. =)  I hope i don't ever experience what people have written about this place.... HAPPY EATINGS!",

Thai Fish Hot Pot with Lobster, Scallops, Shrimp, Squid and Clams also great.  Hong Kong Xo Shrimp with Long Beans and Jasmine Rice is good, but I have had better.  The Japanese Seaweed Salad Sampler is okay...I guess I don't like seaweed that much.  Martinis also yummy...had a watermelon martini which was refreshing.  Service is fast, great.  Decor is great...get a 2nd floor table on the edge for a great view of the giant buddha...hey, there is a koi pond under there!!  (Didn't notice my first time here).    Highly recommend before coming to Vegas or when in Vegas...call for reservations!  Or expect a very long wait, dinner @ 11:30 pm or forget about eating there that night.  This last weekend we were there & settled for an early dinner due to their anniversary celebration & with the with likes of P. Diddy there that night...getting in at any other time would have been impossible.  Also pricey, but hey it is Vegas.",

There are two types of people who come to TAO to eat: 1-those who actually come for the food 2-those who are using the restaurant to get into the club. I must admit first off that I fell into the second category because we brought only brought sausages to the party. That being said I still appreciate good food and the food was mediocre at best.    For those who were wondering what the sashimi was like, wonder no more. It was small PERIOD. Four small pieces to be exact. Because I was freakin starving after that and for some crazy reason did not want all my calories to be liquids, we tried the Peking Duck. The duck came promptly but it was cold and bland tasting. For 60+ bucks you would think they could at least give us warm food.   The only benefit to eating here is that you can get a line pass into the club and you don't need to bring a slew of chicks with you. The service was prompt and our waitress was friendly. Our food was moderate at best and I left hungry and with much less money to spend on the ten dollar beers upstairs. I would have given this two stars but it receives three for the sole reason that it got us into the club without waiting. The extra money just might have been worth it to see the look on all the dudes faces in lines as we passed them by.",

If your tight on cash and can't afford to go big, then I suggest you order just one thing and that is the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables. It is just as good as the reviews claim it to be. Buttery and tender sea bass that melts in your mouth with a delicious miso reduction.  I also loved the Spicy Tuna Tartar bites served atop Crispy Fried Rice. There were 6 of them on the plate and the spicy aoili-like sauce on the plate was fabulous.   Looking for a good bang for your buck?!? Try the Squab Lettuce Wraps, which are delicious and plentiful. We comfortably fed a table for six with them as an appetizer and asked for more lettuce \"shells\" to stretch them even further.   Ohhhh if you are trying to go big, ordered the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon with Tempura Onion Rings. The beef is super tender and the wasabi seasoning on the outer edge is unique and incredible. The beef was also cooked to the perfect temperature.  I would skip out on the satay, the sushi, and the chicken dishes. They are just so-so and I feel like that is when people walk away feeling ripped off.",

We topped it off with the surprising Mango Rice Pudding, which I would come back for again and again! Creamy rice in a mango custard, with mango sorbet and topped with a melted sugar coating that proved crispy and chewy for a great mouth feel!

    "text": "The first time I saw this place, I couldn't wait to try it out. It looked so fancy and beautiful, reminiscent of the Buddha Bar in Washington D.C.  Being a local, I don't really get out much to the strip unless visitors come into town. When some girlfriends of mine came into town, we were very excited about trying Tao.   Our reservations were for 10pm on a Friday night. We didn't get seated until 10:40pm. That wasn't so bad, since the wait staff was very attentive. Finally seated, the three of us ordered right away and then the wait began. During this time, three other tables around us, got seated, served and left, while we kept waiting. The gracious waitress kept coming by to apologize and the faithful water attendant never let our glasses get less than 3/4 full. We definitely got re hydrated, but were starving.   Finally, we requested to speak to the manager. When he finally showed up, he didn't have much to say, and didn't seem at all apologetic. The saddest and most ridiculous part was that he blamed the 90 minute wait on The Wok!! Seriously?!!   This huge establishment should have more than one wok. What kind of excuse it's that? He didn't offer us any appetizers for our trouble and we finally suggested maybe a dessert would be nice.  So, our food finally arrived and I ordered the Duck Fried Rice. I love duck and I'm a kind of a salt-aholic usually, but my dish was just meh, greasy and salty even beyond my ability to tolerate. My friend's dishes were also just ok, but NOT worth the hour and a half wait.   What if we had tickets to a show or had to catch a flight? Anyway, we hoped the desert would be better, but 30 minutes after finishing our meal, dessert still hadn't arrived. A woman came by offering us stamps to get into the night club, which we wanted to try, so we still had hope. Another 15 minutes passed by, still no dessert, we finally decided it was time to leave.  Then it was time for the night club. What a let down! First of all, much like the restaurant, a lot of people weren't even dressed nice. Packed to the gills, as expected, but the dancers looked bored and were barely trying. Then there were these sad, mopey girls sitting in the cement bath tubs. Seriously?   The dancers at Hard Rock are so much more entertaining. I was sad. Sad that my great expectations were crushed, sad that my girlfriends had this same lame experience on their first night in Vegas.   Maybe you need to be blind drunk in order to look passed all these short comings and hoot at the top of your lungs. Maybe that was were we went wrong or maybe Tao jumped the shark.?",

    "text": "Ambience = 6 stars. I have eaten here twice, and on neither occasion did the exceptional interiors disappoint. Except, that is, for the bathroom, which is inhabited by a human soap dispenser. Awkward and disgusting. But overall still a 6 -- yep, it's that nice!   What could be greatly improved are the service and the food. Service is painfully slow, and food is so far removed from Asian it's laughable. Not that I expected the \"Asian Bistro\" to be authentic, but I was expecting the food to be at least palatable (it barely met that standard). The portions are also ginormous so you either let half your meal go to waste or leave completely gorged (take-away is impractical, for obvious reasons). One plus in the food department was presentation: the plating, like the decor, is faultless.   The last time I ate here was during restaurant week, and that ended up being over $200 for 2 people (we ordered wine). I will probably be back, but maybe just for drinks next time.",

The nightlife was fun and I saw a slew of gorgeous women.  You will too :)  My friends and I were here for a real estate conference and one of them suggested this place.  Initially, I thought it would be like PF Changs, Americanized Chinese Food, but I ordered the sea bass (their specialty) and it was awesome!  Most of my bias beforehand comes from the fact that I am asian and eat chinese food everyday, so I did not think some fancy chinese american restaurant would really compare, but it was solid.    Everytime I come to a new venue, I always trust the waitresses and go with their recommendation.  It has served me well.    Be mindful that you are in the Venetian, so I think when the tab was said and done, my dish, one drink and my share of the appetizers and tip came to about $86",

I was also getting information that wasn't True from the 3 hosts, and they had an attitude. Took off 2 stars for the rudeness of the hosts. The point of having a reservation is to NOT have to wait.

    "text": "Eh.  The best part of this place is the amazing decor and ambiance. Food is just fine, but expensive (vegas nightclub strip restaurant, go figure!). We wanted to try out tao because we were with a couple of dudes and knew we could get into the club without paying for a cover for the guys if we ate dinner there.  Just FYI, you must get an entree which does not include most of the sushi, soups, etc. if you want free access to the club. I kinda think the rule is crap because I wanted a miso soup and sushi roll and was planning on ordering multiple drinks but was told that it didn't qualify as an entree selection. SO I ended up getting something I didn't want as much and ordered less drinks. I really couldn't win here. My recommendation would be spending an amount per person or per table, but I am not an expert.   We ordered edamame and tempura shrimp and sweet potato as appetizers. Edamame was SUPER spicy, but I am into that sorta thing so it was good. The tempura was average.For my entree I ordered some special sushi roll with tuna or salmon on top, don't remember. If you couldn't tell the sushi roll was very unmemorable to me. It was average sushi that comes with an AYCE joint. However, this suchi roll was $32! My husband got the lobster pad thai which was presented great, but taste was again average to me.   The highlight of the night was the giant fortune cookie desert that they bring out for celebrations. It was very tasty and great to share.   Bottom Line: Probably won't be back if it is my job to choose a place, but the food was edible, in a beautiful location, with friendly servers.",

The Chilean sea bass was amazing as was the chinese sausage fried rice. There was a sashimi dish my dad ordered that had jalapenos on top. Don't order that. It kills the taste of the sashimi.

We arrived on time and they escorted us to a sitting area while they finished getting our table ready. Only took about 10 minutes and while we waited we were quickly approached for a drink order. The drinks came out right away while we all enjoyed taking in the very lavish decor.  I think we were very fortunate with our service, our waiter, TJ, was EXCELLENT! We ordered everything family style and aside from the dishes we asked for, TJ made some great suggestions.  Everything came out cooked to perfection. I still had a lot of food restrictions to follow and TJ was very attentive to making sure I didn't feel left out and explained which dishes I would be able to eat. Overall, incredible experience! Will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas.",

The dim lights certainly set a certain kind of vibe that can be experienced through out all seating areas.  They have various areas of sitting whether in plush sofa seating for the bar, plush red booths downstairs or actual dining tables upstairs.  The host and waiter were very pleasant and attentive. Real great customer service.  The menu is simple but you will definitely find something for every one.  We ended up ordering the egg rolls,, Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork, and the Shrimp Tempura Spicy tuna Avocado and Soy Paper Roll.  The egg rolls were huge, I can easily see 4 people sharing this plate.  The filling was fresh and definitely a great way to begin the meal.  The sushi roll was very decent as well.  The spicy tuna had all the right textures and flavors.  My least favorite plate was definitely the fried rice.  The description on the menu indicated an explosion of flavors.  It was definitely still delicious but I guess I just wanted to be wowed.  On the occasion of my sisters bday, I ordered the fortune cookie for her.  Also, Please note that if you check in on yelp, the cookie is free.  Which was totally great because it is actually huge, delicious, and selfie worthy!  I really enjoyed this place and even if you are not a huge fan of asian food, try this for a great night out in vegas!",

The sushi roll was probably the worst sushi I've ever eaten. The crispy salmon was dry, unseasoned and the sauce it came with on the side was ridiculously salty. The roll was around $19 and the fish was about $42. We also ordered the Chinese sausage fried rice with egg and pork lo mein for the kids. The kids liked the lo mein and the rice was good but that's about it. THe best thing I had was my cocktail. It was called Taoism. It was vodka, sparkling wine, cucumber melon puree and a bit of lime. That was pretty delicious. It was the only thing I enjoyed. I've been to Tao before and I remembered having a pleasant experience. After this dinner I will not be revisiting Tao nor recommending it to friends. It was so bad.. the service was good & friendly. The decor was outstanding; the food gets a big thumbs down We spent about $350 for this meal. Definitely not worth it..  save your money.",

I thought the noise level was a bit too loud among the music and various side conversations from neighboring tables.  Our group of 14 decided to order family style. Dishes that stuck out to me:   * Spicy Tuna tartare on crispy rice: One of my favorite things I ate at TAO. If you're afraid of spicy food, this wasn't too spicy. I enjoyed the textures and flavors this dish provided.  *Squab lettuce wraps: delicious and easy to wrap.  *Lobster wonton: I thought the wonton was overcooked, which had that \"mushy\" texture. Pass.  *Miso glazed Chillian Sea Bass: Another favorite dish I enjoyed eating. I highly recommend this dish.  Our bill at the end of our meal came out to $45 for 13 of us. Although the food was enjoyable, I personally thought that it wasn't worth $45. Then again, I had no input on what we ordered since one of the girls in our party was responsible for that. I wouldn't mind coming back and giving it another try though.  *EDIT 9-26-12*  I should clarify that each girl paid $45...not $45 for the total bill. If you're all about the food, you might as well head to a good Chinese restaurant and pay half the price.",

Menu is served a little bit in a hurry and not at the same time for all guest. As everything in the States the location is very huge but the interior is designed quite cozy and chic. Air condition as usual too cold! Try! It's better than boring burgers ;-)",

Once my lungs adjusted and I stopped feeling like I was about to have an asthma attack (note: I don't have asthma.. thats how much smokey smelly craziness in the air), the rest of the dining experience was lovely.  I tried both the chilean sea bass with miso glaze and the peppered filet with udon noodles.  Both dishes were absolutely amazing.  When I think of Asian food and beef, I think tough and overcooked.  The filet was so tender and flavorful.  Right after I ordered it, I was regretting my decision thinking that it was going to be mundane and that I should have gone for something more adventurous, but the dish had wonderful complex flavors that took it way beyond what you would think a beef and noodle dish would be.  The sea bass was so flavorful.  I have tried chilean sea bass many times before, and I have always been put off by the flavor.  This was done right, the miso glaze was amazing.  Our drinks were great, our party of four all selected different cocktails so we could sample each others drinks.  All of them were delicious.  My favorite was the Tao Love Potion #9.   For desert we shared the giant fortune cookie filled with white chocolate and dark chocolate mouse with fresh fruit.  Kind of cheesy, but it was really tasty and the fortunes were pretty funny.  Aside from food and drink, the restaurant decor is beautiful and the service was great, would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been to the club here before, which will be reserved for a seperate review.  Dining at Tao is one of those Vegas experiences that you will remember.  Located at the Venetian, which is like a LEGO-land comprised of the Gritti Palace and the Royal Danieli with St. Mark's and the Grand Canal thrown in for good measure, Tao is a Buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.    You will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  Take the opportunity to order a Grey Goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot Asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the European bitches in their Milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  Yes, yes, tres chic, I know.   The dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  Not sure if I'd come here for a \"special occasion\" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  Our waiter was cool, reminded me of a SoCal dude, like he'd hang out in Venice Beach.    For dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and kobe beef shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the kobe beef was like eating Kobe Tai, go figure).  With our main course (we both got the miso glazed Chilean sea bass) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice).   I'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, I believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy Voices in the Mist was our least favorite - I walked out of here a bit rocked.  For dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.    In the end, $244.00 for two before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  Will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy.",

The wise and skilled waiter (Jake) sagely suggested that we set an approximate cost per person of around $70 or so (not including drinks) and he bring out multiple entrees and serve family style. We had a few vegetarians in the group.  This plan worked very very well. The vegetarian dishes (kung pao tofu, spring rolls, vegetable dumplings, sake-flavored mushrooms) were all quite good. The Sea Bass skewers were out of this world. Also quite good were the lobster dumplings. Service was excellent at all times, though this might have been influenced by a VIP in our group. B/c said VIP among other stuff we were treated to sushi, some apps and a dessert platter with a giant fortune cookie stuffed with yum, ice cream, apple dumplings, pocky, and stuff similar to cannolis. The dessert was good, but definitely not the best stuff that this place has. If you are looking to save money, skip dessert here.  Perhaps our experience was not normal b/c the VIP on board, however the food, ambiance as well as the great wine/liquor menu justify a splurge here. If your waiter is half as good as Jake, you will be 100% satisfied.",

My only complaints are that 1-the sushi we ordered came with cucumber when the waiter said it came with avocado, and neither one of us like cucumber, and 2-no cream cheese...I LOVE cream cheese in my sushi! So, that made me a little sad.   Other than that, it was an overall nice experience.",

Let me just explain that there are different types of 'customers' i am the type that patiently waits for the server to be ready, i am the nice customer that smiles and says thank you, and waits.   Ma' BOO... on the other hand is Mr. 'Right now', Mr. New Yawk. He orders when he's ready, weather he sees you ready with your pen and paper or not he's gonna order. He wont wait for you to make time to stop by, he goes to get serviced. He pretty much thinks he is Prince Aladdin.   Thats why i felt bad when i came here. He is all about himself. He wants shots and martinis before dinner... he will make the server go run and get it. The food was great. Boo didnt love it soo much but the service was great.   The staff made sure we took our 'couple' picture at midnight and they were awesome. I will come back next time i come to vegas. But boo wasnt so excited about the $200+ dinner tab :(",

Additionally, why is the restaurant staff telling me to go up to the club, just to block me at the door.    If you want to spend a lot of money and then get shit on, go here.  In Chicago, their sushi wouldn't even break the top five.  This place is so shallow that all the 5-star reviews are probably from people that work here.  Notice all the 1-star reviews.  There are a lot of tools working here.  Congratulations, you make $10 an hour.  I'm on vacation and I have to deal w/ these losers.  Great!

That being said, this review is for the restaurant, which I can say I'd rather go to more than the nightclub.  The best thing I ate here was the kobe beef sashimi, which was one of our appetizers. My friend claimed it was good. I don't think I will ever doubt his taste in food after tasting the sashimi. It is super flavorful and it felt like a party in my mouth (please, no dirty comments, haha).  The lobster and shrimp dumplings were tasty too. The lobster wontons could use improvement, so I wouldn't recommend it.  As for my main course, I had the tuna with peppercorn sauce (I don't think that's on their website menu), which I thought was pretty good until I had a taste of my friend's miso glazed sea bass. Soooooo delectable. It melted in my mouth. I really enjoyed my meal and the wait staff were really nice.  Tao is a bit overpriced, but I'm still willing to come back, especially for the kobe beef sashimi (if I didn't mention it enough times). Plus, it's actually really nice inside.

    "text": "So the best meal of the whole vacation goes to... Tao. What do you think of when you think of Tao, besides Winnie-the Pooh, maybe a pathway or a philosophy of the True nature of the world? Tao restaurant located in the Venetian has found their \"pathway\" through their food.   Unbeknownst to me, Tao is one of the hottest places on the strip. Not only is it a restaurant but a lounge, banquet hall, a club, and celeb hot spot. I guess I know how to pick them! What I like is that the service treats everyone like royalty. The service here is insanely fast and they have more then enough staff on hand. We met one host and then got seated by another, then our server, a water guy, a guy that brings out food, and then a guy that takes it all away. The decor was insane too, dark rich colors, all kinds of fabrics, very bold and very detailed. Of course the 16 foot tall Buddha stands out just a little.   The most impressive attribute about Tao is their food. Tao specializes in Hong Kong Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisines. I know it's a lot but this location is huge so they room for it all. The crispy Tuna roll was unbelievable and all it consisted of was fresh tuna in a roll with a crispy outer ring of something (they wouldn't tell me what is was). Vegetable dumplings and veg egg rolls were surprisingly filling and were perfectly cooked. Of course you have to get something tempura, I recommend the asparagus, it wasn't greasy at all, we loved them. So for dessert you have to get the Giant Fortune Cookie (it's almost the size of your head), yeah it's cheesy but it's filled with white and chocolate mousse and you won't be able to put your spoon down.   Other then the drinks Tao is relatively cheap, at least compared to most of Vegas. But even if it wasn't Tao is worth the visit.",

We walked past the GIANT buddah near the wall and were seated at one of the many tables. I don't remember most of what we had for dinner by now, but it was cutely presented. I remember some pretty good sushi, seafood, and steak...  My favorite is the also GIANT fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse topped with tons of tropical fruits.",

    "text": "Fantastic looking club with awesome Asian and Zen decor and vibe. Didn't eat at Tao nor go clubbing upstairs but had drinks here.   To enter, you walk through this tunnel with bathtubs of water and flower petals - we didn't see any women in these tubs despite the many reports of them. You then enter a super cool-looking big lounge area with dim lighting where you can get a drink and watch all the pretty people and wannabe's walk by. Past the lounge is the restaurant area where you are greeted by this ginormous buddha statue with candles all around it.  Bottom line: Probably one of the most cool and happening places in Vegas to grab drinks with some friends and people-watch in a hip Asian atmosphere . But come early to secure a booth as it can become a madhouse with lines of ppl out front when the club opens.",

    "text": "Dinner here was AMAZING.  We made sure to get an earlier reservation (6:30) on a Friday evening, so we didn't have to worry about the night club crowd coming or having our reservation be bumped.  I had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another.  We were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn't have been more perfect.  There were two of us having dinner this evening, and Tao didn't disappoint (at this time slot) for a romantic evening.  The lighting, decor, and music were all absolutely perfect.  We started out with the lobster wontons and veggie dumplings.  He had a gin and tonic, I ordered a shirley temple  (unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers, but I wasn't going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of stairs for another soda for this pregnant chick).  Entrees were wasabi crusted filet mignon and orange chicken with pork fried rice.  PHEN-O-MENAL.  I have never had such good food enter my mouth.  I HATE steak, and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert.  Dessert was fruit and sorbet, making for a perfect food ending to the experience.  Our server was just ok, but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos.  Just an over all pleasant guy.  I suggest this restaurant to anyone...just make sure you go earlier in the evening, and I think you'll be hard pressed to bitch about ANYTHING.",

OMG!  First of all this place gets a 5 for ambiance. The two-story tall Buddha statue looks like something I would put in my house if I was a millionare. I love Asian decor. I have a much smaller red Buddha in my condo as we speak. I love the Koi pond and this place is just cool. What can I say. It's not just the place. It literally makes you feel like a cooler person when you walk in here. The food is awesome. Nothing on the menu is bad. I've had steak entrees that were great and everything else is just delicious. The miso clam soup is soo good. They put whole clams in the shell into your soup. I don't know who thought this would work but it actually does! Delicious. I love Tao.",

I have to admit, I'm a Chinese-food snob, having grown up amongst some of the best Chinese and Polynesian cuisine on the East Coast, so take my review with a grain of salt (or drop of soy sauce). Every dish was fine, but nothing was standout, and therein lies my complaint. If you're the most fashionably trendy Asian restaurant on the Strip, shouldn't you have at least one dish that's memorable not for its presentation but its flavor? Nothing was over the top, even my carnivorous friends admitted as much.  The decor was, of course, Vegas fab. Love the ginormous Buddha and carved lighting fixtures. But at our table of 10, where was the ubiquitous Lazy Susan? That was sorely missing, and added some aggravation -- as well as spills -- to our meal.",

The wait for a table was a bit long for a Wednesday night, but we sat in the lounge up front and had some cocktails.  The dining area was a little \"cozy\" for my tastes, but we were led to a corner booth with plenty of room to be space hogs.  The giant Buddha across from us was awesome.  The food was splendid - the tempura was tender and crispy, the dumplings burst with flavor, and I even had duck for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly.  My dining partner enjoyed the evening so much he took a rock from the assortment  behind us as a souvenir.  I don't think that's recommended by the management.  The thing that cracked me up the most about this place were the, what I like to refer to them as, Slut Fortune Cookies.  My fortune said, 'This evening, don't let common sense be your guide.'  With fool proof advice like this, no wonder Tao's celebrity clientele go all over the world flashing their cover-upable bits.",

We started with the sea bass as a appy which was amazing! next time i am ordering the entree. We ordered the lobster and crab rolls which while good they were not worth the price. We also ordered the fingerling lobster which was really good. I didnt order any fancy drinks only because i didnt see anything that appealed to me. My husband always gets beer and thing time i talked him into trying something diiferent. He went for the sake flight and was so happy he tried it. The restrooms are really fun to try and figure out which one to go in. While washing my hands in the restroom i could hear my husbands calling me. I checked to see if he was at the bathroom door and i saw him looking at me under the mirror! LOL. There is a huge gap between the mens and womens mirrors so make sure to check this out :)  I will be adding a updated review because i will be visiting again in april.",

Its hip and loud inside. Not ideal for a romantic setting but highly recommended for those dining with friends. We had dinner reservations at 10pm on a Thursday night but wasn't seated til 10:45 so we hung out at the bar and had a few drinks. The place is packed! Apparently its the cool place to be for a Thursday night according to the host. The men there are very aggressive. My fiance' had to be on me so that they would stay away.  After being seated, we had our food within minutes. They have great service other than the wait which is totally understandable. Everyone is very polite and eager to please. They are also attentive to your needs. Someone would go by our table every few minutes to refill drinks or to make sure everything was ok.  Food is AWESOME and cheap! I had Wok Seared NY Sirloin which was yummy til I tasted fiance's Chilean Sea Bass which made me cry. Im salivating as Im typing right now reminiscing of how good it was. We are both fish eaters because he sport fishes every weekend. Fish dont really impress me til I had this sea bass. I dont know how they cooked it but it tasted like fish flavored butter. Soooo goood!!!! We had the giant fortune cookie for desert and it was awesome! It had fruits around it one of them being lychee. A fruit I havent eaten since I left Manila. Fiance' has never tasted it but loved it! It brough great nostalgic memories of my childhood. =)  The restroom is confusing but theres a very polite guy who directs you where to go. Going to and fro the restroom: ladies beware. Men seem to pop out of nowhere and hit on you. Its annoying when you have to go pee really bad.  A Tao employee was going around giving free wrist stamps for people that ate inside the restaurant so they can go in the club upstairs. We decided to check it out since we're already there. The club was huge but packed! Im glad we didnt have to wait 2 hours in line and pay just so we can be pushed around inside. Great scene for single people looking for a vegas hook-up.  In a nutshell: Great food and service Not ideal for romantic dinner Great for people in groups (pre-game dinner) Eat at the restaurant if you want to go in the club so you can save money and not stand in  line Club is great if youre single and looking for a hook up If youre going there with a date its best to get bottle service so you can have a place to sit and relax",

So we had 9:30 dinner reservations and as expected, didn't get seated until 10pm (this is for a party of 2). But I am not the type to get all worked up about that. Our table was the type where you can hear your neighbors conversation and they can hear yours without trying.  I am not a fan of that.  The food was good, I had salmon and my date had shrimp and the portions were generous in comparison to other restaurants of the same kind.  The drinks were pricey, my well vodka with grapefruit juice was $12 but it was large and strong.  Our server was attentive and helpful.  We were not able to go to the club because it was a Sunday night and the club was closed.  So, despite the little mishaps, TAO did not disappoint.",

I got a couple of tempura dishes (sweet potatoe and avocado) and some type of chicken dish. My husband tried sushi and something else and we are both a fan. It turns into a club upstairs at night and it's free to get in as long as you get your hand stamped. However, you still have to go back outside and wait in line again to go into the club. The club was too crowded, loud, and had a much younger crowd that what I would have liked so we didn't enjoy the club portion but the restaurant is a must do!",

What I don't like about this club (where should I begin is more like it):  They let in too many effin' people in this place.  I don't appreciate getting crushed like a sardine or getting dry humped by random strangers on the dance floor.  Just say no to STD's OK?  I'm pretty sure the amount of people on the dance floor violated fire codes.  I couldn't even move for a good ten minutes cuz I was either getting pushed by people trying to get on the dancefloor, people decided to walk by me cuz for some reason there was no other space for them to walk past, or people bumped into me cuz they were trying to dance.  Not my idea of a good time.  The only time I put up with that noise is when I'm seeing my favourite band in the entire world.  I'm sure if you're a girl, you can get in no matter what you're wearing.  Sucks if you're a guy though.  Also some friends we were trying to meet somehow got invited to get on the VIP list but then later they asked them how they got on the list.  We got attitude from a bouncer saying \"You can't bring in a shopping (plastic) bag to the club.\"  OK, well we went shopping before going to your place.  Luckily, my friends had very large purses so they got creative and shoved the bag in that.  Shoot us.  There's no such thing as coat check here I guess.  They really oughta invest in one of those, it's good for business.    I'm not a fan of hip hop clubs to begin with, but seriously 30 minutes of a SexyBack mash up filled in with clips of various other top 40 of course?  I like a little more variety.  Last time I checked this was Vegas...play something a little more hip.  I went to a club in my boring suburban town that played similar stuff...I guess DJ AM was at this club too perhaps?  I'm sure this place is tons of fun if you arrive early and leave early, but if you get here around midnight or later, forgetaboutit.  No room to dance.  No room to walk.  Get me to the bar for some water please.  Confusing \"EXIT\" signs too.  I had to ask five different staff members how to get out of this joint and I ended up back where I started.  Cover was also $20 which I guess is \"reasonable\" by Vegas standards.  I couldn't even enjoy the cool decor in here because I just wanted to get the eff out of there.  Not my idea of a good time.  I'd rather go shopping here or stay in the hotel.  No club for this party pooper.",

When we got there it was like a chicken coop with chickens scrambling around with their necks cut off. It was packed tight. Just to get to the podium to check into 30 mins. Right in front of me was a guy who cut the line, and did that bribe in hand thing to get a table. I saw it with my very own eyes. The hosts played stupid and pretended that they were returning customers. Please. I know how it is. There was a bar in front and the restaurant was towards the back. Odd to me, to have clubbers and people eating at the same time. Our server was nice and was attentive with everything. The music from the club was pretty good. I didn't imagine myself actually eating a meal in a club type atmosphere, but it was upbeat and something different. The food was okay. Sushi was pretty good. The hot and sour soup was probably the best I've ever had. The lobster dumplings were also very good. The sauce it came in was perfect. The drinks were surprisingly tasty. Enough alcohol for you not to complain about it yet still had the flavors of the drink. Wasn't too expensive, which was good on my pocketbook. The decor was beautiful. The center Buddha was divine and a def picture opp. It was where I got my first Vegas kiss from a total stranger. =)   Note to men who want kisses from women at a tourist deathtrap:   Guy: Can you girls take a pic with me? Girls: Yea, okay. *picture get taken* Girl #1: Okay you can move now Guy: I will move if you give me a kiss on the check Girl #1: Yea okay. *moves in for kiss on check* Guy: turns his head and plants one on the girls lips. Girl #1: SNEAKY! Can't hate you for that..that was a good one!",

The other asian fusion looked ok too, typical pad thai and some chinese/meiguoren type dishes, ie: orange chicken...The service was really really good though, they brought our food out and while pouring a champagne toast (bachelorette party) it got cold and they made a whole new order, and also gave us complimentary watermelon kamikaze shots on the house. Niiiiice. The waiters were all young and not hard on the eyes either...heeeey.",

Sea Bass is really good too. i ate upstairs where you have a great view of the buddha. everything at this restaurant is good as hell. i highly recommend this place over any restraunt in the other hotels. you cannot go wrong ordering here.",

It covered my face, sweater and lap where my new Louis Vuitton clutch resided! Never said sorry but gave a used wet rag from wiping a table down. Ewwww who does that, seriously????? After that point, he never apologized when he presented the check nor tried to make it right. Now I have a ruined sweater and smell like soy sauce. When it comes my things, I don't mind it spilling on my head, but don't ruin my materialistic items",

    "text": "I had a pretty good experience at Tao, and would recommend people check it out. I'd maybe give it 3.75 stars.  Here's a random collection of thoughts, along with a really cool story about what happened to me here!  Service: my waitress was cheerful and pretty cool. The people at the front, however, along with the reservations girl, were aloof in the \"too-cool-for-school\" kind of way. Also, this place doesn't give current wait time if you call and ask them, which is unnerving (is this a problem specific to Vegas?).  Atmosphere: 5/5. This is where Tao earns its stripes. It is a truly beautiful restaurant, with a big golden Buddha resting in the center of the restaurant, framed by lots of red booths and dark lighting. Think of it as a PF Chang's on steroids. Beautiful inside!  Food: Nothing to write home about, about on the level of PF Chang's, but still pretty good. I tried their Orange Chicken ($28), with white Jasmine rice ($5), and it was fairly tasty (though I wasn't blown away). I also had the vegetable egg rolls ($12), and those were pretty good as well, but again not mind-blowing.   Story 1: I came here alone (I was in Vegas on business, and no not that kind of business), so I kinda felt like the guy in forgetting Sarah Marshall who comes to the restaurant, where Jonah Hill says \"aw dude, you came alone? Do you want a magazine or something?\"  Story 2: Also, I ran into multi-billionaire, and Venetian owner, SHELDON ADELSON right by this place. I looked him right in the eye, he looked me in the eye! And then he looked away, and I felt poor.",

    "text": "A friend and I visited Tao's restaurant and club in Vegas during memorial weekend 2015 and we were definitely impressed.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. The entrance to the restaurant itself was very unique! Walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. No pictures were allowed but I tried unsuccessfully anyway. We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full.  Once we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us. After having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge. The club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. Like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. Snoop dogg was the entertainment for the night I was there. When the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. But on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers LOL. My friend said they were a relief from her high heels. I simply took mine home as a souvenir. The take home slippers were definitely a unique touch. The only negative that I could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm in Vegas again.",

Prior to coming in, I of course had to check yelp for pictures and reviews. I was sad to find that the salmon served with udon noodles was no longer available. Also, the menu seems all sorts of confused, but I had to remind myself it's an Asian bistro... Meaning fusion; and it definitely was. They serve everything ranging from Japanese shabu to Chinese dim sum to Thai pad Thai noodles.   A friend of mine insisted that we had to eat here because she never leaves Vegas without eating here at least once. Why? Because he's obsessed with:  Chilean Sea Bass ($39) miso-glazed sea bass on top of a bed of veggies. Just a little sweet and all sorts of delicious. My friend did not steer me wrong. Portion was perfect and I left happy that I wasn't stuffed and excited I had room for dessert :)",

They have an incredible menu, large, and very creative in the categories of: Sushi and Sashimi, Soup, Dim Sum, Tempura, Fish, Noodles and Rice, and numerous dishes \"Noble Treasures From The Sea\", \"From The Sky\", and \"From The Land\".  I've tried a lot!  But, this is the best! =========================== Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($39)  I've tried each of these, and hardly near done with the menu: ============================================== Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Ponzu Sauce ($18), Octopus Salad with Aji Amarillo and Baby Watercress ($19), Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail Roll with Crushed Onion ($15), Shrimp Tempura ($8), Spicy Tuna, Avocado in Soy Paper Roll ($16), Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll with Avocado in Soy Paper ($17), Crispy Soft Shell Crab with Yuzu Mayonnaise ($17), Roasted Shishito Peppers with Yuzu ($10), TAO Temple Salad ($12), Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce ($14), Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame ($17), Chicken Wing Lollipops ($18), Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice ($19), Thai Crab Cakes with Mango Chili Sauce ($19), Spicy Thai Dumpling Soup ($13), Glazed Salmon with Sesame Eggplant and Shiso Vinaigrette ($31), Crispy Coconut Shrimp with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce ($33), Filet Mignon Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($38), Spicy Hoi Yin Eggplant ($12), Vegetable Fried Brown Rice ($13).   Their motto: ========= Our servers are here to guide you, so please call upon them for the smallest of favors. TAO has no set rules. Be creative, live long, be happy and follow your own path. ...And the Emperor said, \"let the party begin!\"  Conclusion: ========= Make a reservation late with your sweetheart and go!  Great place.

It is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.  First of all, we were asked, \"Still or sparkling?\" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.  When ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.  The meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles. (Yes, it was also appreciated that they had GF options!)  we were also able to use their buy-one-get-one promotion for cocktails as it was happy hour. However, everyone at the table was really disappointed and rather indignant at the service that was given.   The cuisine was good but the experience was marred by the sub-par service and the costly extras.",

    "text": "Cool place with amazing decor. The service was fast and competent BUT......I think the food is tasteless and ridiculously overpriced.  $20+ sushi rolls that are made with, what taste like mushy rice that you would get when you buy sushi from the grocery store.  $19 for Spicy tuna tare tare on crispy rice. You get a total of 5 pieces about the size of your big thumb.  $39 for Miso glazed seabass. I followed the hype on Yelp and it was NOT worth it. I would say it's about 5\"x5\" piece of fish sitting on a small bed of oil-drenched Chinese veggies. The fish tasted over cooked marinated in miso. Wasn't what I expected. Very disappointing.   $18 Mandarin fried rice with shrimp - no flavor but they do give you a lot of shrimp.   if you're looking for good tasting Asian food... I would explore elsewhere. There's no flare to it.",

    "text": "No...No...No!!!   This place was an overpriced PF Changs with absolutely horrid service; on a Tuesday (late) night nor less.   We had 8:30pm reservations. Waited 15-20 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. Here's a tip, put some better lighting in your place since your servers obviously cannot tell who has or hasn't eaten, received drinks, etc.  After we (finally) received our drinks, we waited another 15-20 for the server to come back for the dinner order. We totally skipped appetizers because of this. I was disappointed because I really wanted to try a roll or three.  Food came out within about 20 minutes. Everything was right. Flavor wise, it wasn't anything to scream about. I've had much better salmon dishes. He made a huge point about \"our salmon comes medium rare, is that OK?\" There was hardly any pink, so meh. The sesame glazed eggplant was a salt lick. Fried rice was OK and the cauliflower was the best part of the meal.  I guess if you're in Vegas, this is how it is I noticed here and other places. Horrible service with high prices. Thank goodness the boss paid. I'll never go back.",

This place is very well decorated and the staff is really friendly. We got seated since we made prior reservations. The restaurant was perfectly dimmed. We asked our waitress for recommendations since we have never been there before. Annie, our waitress recommended us 3 appetizers which was the Bao Buns, the buns were really soft and tasty it was filled with meat. The second plate was the spicy tuna with rice crisp, I really enjoyed this dish. The spicy tuna wasn't overly spicy and I really liked the crispy rice. The third plate was the lobster potsticker which was pretty good with its sauce that it's doused in. I really enjoyed all three plates. Annie was a great waitress, she always came to our table to check up on us and refilled our waters. My overall experience was just very pleasant.",

From the west coast to the gulf coast when people talk about going to Las Vegas someone always says Tao is a great place...so kudos on the marketing guys.   There are, however, two sides to this coin. The food side is not extraordinary rather it is very good and very well plated. Not adventurous with the menu and the tastes as one would imagine an expensive highly touted restaurant would be. The best thing by far on the menu was the fortune cookie dessert. Holy moly it is the one thing that saved an otherwise typical experience at an westernized Asian restaurant. The fortune cookie dessert with the different chocolates littered with the fresh fruits is by far the best thing I ate all day.   The club...well the decor and the ambiance make it the great place that people talk about all the time. The drinks stand out better than most clubs in high priced casinos. Ultimately, it is a trap for first time Las Vegas visitors.   Stick with the restaurant side.",

I don't even typically like fish and I was still enjoying the occasional bites from her plate. I got the filet mignon and again was amazing. Great cook but the sauce and veggies mixed in is what really put it all together. The boneless ribs was so tender as well. Champagne was a bit expensive but that's what you expect I guess ordering glasses of champagne so no complains about it. And lastly our server was amazing. A little mad at myself for forgetting her name because I'd love to name drop her amazing service on here. Super friendly and was always checking up on us. Overall I'd definitely recommend but just be prepared for the cost.",

Tao the club was buzzing, and a deal including dinner at the restaurant and bottle service in the club for about $150/pp was actually a pretty solid deal.  Unfortunately, Tao's food is nothing to write home about.  Essentially P.F. Chang's with even more offensive interior decor, Tao's \"Asian\" food is basically designed for the lowest common denominator - the Midwestern palate.  Spring rolls were okay.  Potstickers were okay.  Crispy orange chicken came straight from the cauldrons of Panda Express.  Soy ginger salmon was okay - the udon was a bit unruly though.  Desserts were excessive.  What the hell were they thinking with a chocolate-filled egg roll?  A bite guarantees an oral blast of too-sweet chocolate, versus that same blast recreating a chocolate necklace on your clubwear.  But yes, we did get to skip the Tao line.  Maybe a solution would be to pre-eat elsewhere, then just drop the money for nightclub purposes and save yourself the culinary dishonor.",

First the good:  They confirmed my reservation and at that time I mentioned a special event we were dining for, ended up with questionably the best table right above and directly in front of the giant Buddha.  Cocktail waiter was fabulous and the food menu was also explained really well. We ordered 4 starters (dim sum, satay, egg rolls) between 2 and didn't need a main course.  Also were asked if we were in any rush for a show etc which I thought was a nice touch!  The bad:  The waiter seemed to be displeased at being asked to take a picture for us, I appreciate its a common request but a bit of grace would be nice. The food tastes amazing but is VERY salty, it tastes amazing but if salt effects you be aware! It's not the cheapest option but it is beautiful and the food and presentation is lovely!",

Hey, it's The Venetian on Strip. Whatya expect!   I did have to minus a star because:  1. two of the dishes were considerably over salted...the brussel sprouts and the long beans...no biggie, but ruined the perfection. 2.

The fish was fresh and great quality but the other dishes (pad Thai, Lo mein, orange chicken) were just okay. Not surprisingly they were more expensive than your average Chinese food-- which was expected and fine given the setting-- but I assumed that the higher price point would equate to elevated, special dishes. However, they were not much different than a neighborhood 12$/dish Asian food joint. I would recommend coming for sushi/apps but there are much better places for dinner in Vegas.",

And they knew how to mix a cocktail, which always wins me over.   However, the food was only decent, not great - both the entrees and the sushi. For those prices, I'd at the very least expect good. And the music was playing so loudly that we had to scream at each other to be heard.  The highlight of dinner was dessert. We got an enormous platter that included a little bit of everything - the molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream, chocolate Buddhas, the giant fortune cookie, and the chocolate parfait. It was INCREDIBLE. I'd go back just for that alone. Yum.  Overall - definitely worth checking out, but a bit overrated.",

    "text": "We came here on May 20, 2013 and weren't quite sure what we would be getting. It's Asian with a twist - and a nice one at that.  We ordered two starters - chicken satay and the carpaccio.  They were so flavourful it was hard not to lick the plates after we had decimated both.  I had the Thai Buddha chicken and my husband had the Kung Pao chicken.  Mine was tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice, and hubby's was great as well.  For sides we had the jasmine rice (just slightly sticky), and the Asian stir fry which was underwhelming.   All in all, this place serves great food at elevated prices.  I don't think I would go back again, however I'm happy that I tried it and was able to judge it for myself.  I can report that the chicken, once again, was yummy, as were the starters.  The reason for the three stars is due to the sides and the prices - paying $29.00 for Kung Pao chicken is a bit over the top. Perhaps Tao should stop taking itself so seriously.   Special shout out to the bathroom attendant - make sure you throw a couple of bucks into the tip jar!",

To start, I had the Tao-Tini. It obviously did its job since I barely remember dinner.  For dinner had: Edamame-Always a delicious choice Alaskan Salmon, Crab and Avocado Roll (...I think...I don't remember...) Hong Kong XO Shrimp with Long Beans and Jasmine Rice  Now, that night was a little fuzzy, but I do remember the food being DELICIOUS! I hate green beans, so when I saw shrimp on a bed of rice, with green long beans circling my plate, I was convinced I made the wrong choice. Turns out long green beans aren't really green beans. They're just long beans.",

Dinner was a little fast-paced...I had read that Tao was the top-grossing restaurant in the U.S. (probably with the club receipts), and I realize that means table turnover is crucial, but it's not like we were four girls taking up the table for hours after splitting a salad.  Food was tasty -- loved the squab lettuce wraps and yes, the chilean sea bass (although isn't it still on the do-not-eat list?) melts in your mouth.  Not sure if that one's worth the guilt.  Drinkwise, the Taotini is the way to go...it's like juice and is practically a value drink at $10.",

So, the experience was a great one!    My party of eight got a varied mix of food but I had the filet mignon udon noodles and I have to say, they were pretty damn good.

We were entertained by some strong cocktails and a wandering saxophonists playing to the house beats the DJ was spinning. I tried to avert the saxophonist but homeboy just could not let up.  It is a beautiful restaurant. we were not thinking it would be a quiet romantic dinner. The husband and I did sharesies and had the spicy tuna tartare appetizer which looked like a roll, the rice had a crunch as if they put in on a frying pan...it was good.  Memorable was the wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings. It had a little kick only wasabi would bring. Also memorable the crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with crushed onion rings. The lo mein with pork- ah okay...but you can get that anywhere i think. The lobster and shrimp dumplings were good.  Drinks were really good.  We enjoyed the people watching and the pulsing beats of the DJs. It's Vegas so don't expect bible study groups-it's all about the bachelors/bachelorettes and general party people. oh and ask for the stamp so you don't have to wait in the awful line",

    "text": "After watching an insanely trippy show by Elton John at Caesar's palace (I swear I needed drugs to fully appreciate that show)me, my sister, my cousins and their friends headed over Tao for a late (and I mean LATE - it was a 10:45pm reservation!) dinner. I was little bit skeptical about going to eat at this place.  First off, I'm from San Francisco - it's hard to top the taste of Bay Area Asian foods that sell for a cheaper rate than Tao, and 2nd - it was ridiculously loud because Tao night club is right above the restaurant.  We had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 minutes.  Fine... I got that it was busy.  But after not having dinner, and being a little loopy after the Elton John show - I wasn't a very happy camper and I wanted to bail.  But the dinner was for a birthday and I didn't want to disappoint by being a Crabby Patty.  So I dealt with it.  Since we were a large group of 10, we were seated in a nice little alcove in the very back of the restaurant.  It was nice and cozy and I felt at ease.  Thank heavens we weren't in the middle of the restaurant where it was crowded. I was crabby enough as it was to have to deal with the lack of space.    We had a nice view of Mike Tyson as he sat at the table behind us with a lovely female friend.  We tried to be slick in taking pictures of him as each one of us placed our order.  When the food came out, I wasn't so impressed by the presentation but I figured I shouldn't judge by looks alone.  I ordered the Chicken Yellow Curry.  The smell was heavenly. I saw the little pieces of lemongrass in it. That was different for me. I've never had Chicken Yellow Curry with lemongrass. I poured some curry on my rice and took a spoonful... it was fantastic that I had to offer some over to everyone else for a taste.  The chicken potstickers on the table tasted fresh and succulent.  My sister had a beef dish that was just DIVINE.  But my favorite was the dish I ordered.  And today I still crave for that wonderful burst of flavor on my tongue.  As I always say... \"Party in my mouth...heeeeyyyyy!!!\"",

If you read my last review on Alex I had to chastise you guys a little bit, but fret not, you have been redeemed.  After an amazing \"evening with Cher\" @ Caesars palace, my friend and I fell through Tao and had an extraordinary time.  Details:  Arrival was swift, I anticipated a wait based on prior Yelpers experience, and received the Olive Garden style beeper then shown to the well decorated and seductively lit lounge with quite a view of the gussied up Vegas party-goers.    After about twenty minutes, my dining companion and I received our table with a round of drinks on the house due to the wait.  Way to go on the customer service Tao.  I had the Tao-tini--A+ my friend the Tao Cosmo.  Both smooth and easy.    The food--ordered in portions and had wonderful dishes: Spicy Lobster/Crab roll excellent Steamed Veggie Dumplings--needs extra dunking sauce yum yum Dragon Tail ribs--ok could have done without Crispy Rice Tuna Tartar--OMG, could have 2 of these Hot Edamame--fav.  Dessert was over the top:   Giant Fortune Cookie exploding w/ chocolate mousse VERY rich, so be warned Rice Pudding Creme Brule w/ extra scoop of ginger ice cream!  Just like mom used to make back south--right.    Our waiter was helpful, but a bit stuffy--otherwise an overall stellar performance by Tao.  Be careful not to trip on the way out over the eager Tao nightclub revelers.",

I had never been a fan of sushi before (in fact, had a few bad experiences with sushi) but was willing to try a \"good\" place. Wow! So yummy!! Highly recommend it!   There were four of us in the party and we didn't have reservations--highly recommend you make reservations--so we had to wait for like an hour. We sat in the bar downstairs and got properly drunk while we waited. By the time we were heading to our table, it was standing room only, and difficult to move.  As with everything else in Vegas, it's pricey. But worth it. With dinner, you get a hand stamp to get into the club upstairs for free. That was pretty cool. Unfortunately I was with some people that didn't want to go to the club, so I just poked my head in and looked around but didn't stay.  The bathrooms were very cool too.  It was almost midnight when we settled the bill and left. The place was PACKED and the music was loud, but enjoyable. I'd definitely go back again and again!  The only downside, besides being pricey, was that it was hard to find inside the Venetian. I'm not sure which entrance it's at, but I always get lost inside The Venetian!",

The eight of us shared the kobe beef with scallons, XO shrimp,Pad thai,lo mein, kung pao chicken, assorted sashimi, and the lobster dish that I totally hate my friend for ordering .... just kidding about the hate part.....  Every entree was very salty, and the worst part was it tasted like the same sauce was used for every dish. with all the food we ordered and consumed, I actually still had room for dessert, I must say this is probably the best part of the meal. The chocolate parfait with Godiva liquer was nice, balances out the saltiness lingering in my mouth. Tried hubby's lychee sorbet - refreshing, kid's mousse fortune cookie, so-so, but they found it amusing.

From the sweet potatoes, to the onion rings, to the Pad Thai.  Everything was just amazing.  Our server was excellent.  He was friendly without being annoying.  I told the server that I was a Concierge and that I worked for an elite company (the name of which I can't say here because I'll get FIRED!!!)  and he brought out a complimentary fortune cookie.  I'm not talking about those little shits you get from the takeout place up the road.  This was a massive, probably 5 pound fortune cookie with one side filled with chocolate mousse and the other filled with white chocolate.  Covered in fresh, tropical fruit, it was absolutely stunning to look at and even better to devour.  Entering the bathroom, it's sort of hard to tell which one is for you as they are only labeled with \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\"  Which one am I? Yin or Yang?  Omg omg omg.  A brief panic attack hit me as I feared entering the wrong gender bathroom in the hippest restaurant in Las Vegas.  Luckily, some slutty looking chicks went into one of the bathrooms (can't remember if it was yin or yang) and so I went into the opposite one.  Inside, a convenience store was waiting.  This is not a joke.  Every type of gum, breath mint/spray/strip, and designer cologne you could imagine was just sitting there.  Like 10 grand worth of Burberry just laying around.   Heaven! Except there wasn't an overly friendly Indian man working in there.  So, not a TRUE convenience store, but I'm confident that Tao will complete the theme sometime in the near future.  Anyway, Tao is even on opentable, so I really can't even find one, single flaw with the whole place.  If you're in Vegas, go there!  (If you're hot/cool/trendy/rich enough.... you fucking loser.)",

My favorite dish was the wasabi-crusted filet with onion ring tempura, not because the meat was silky and tender (which it was - credit where credit is due) but because the onion ring tempura resembled an insane alien pod ship. But otherwise it took us half an hour for our tea to arrive, and I know it doesn't take half an hour to boil water. Or to steep tea. Or both. And the desserts were a royal disappointment - I mean people, Godiva chocolate should not be listed on a menu. It's not impressive, nor is it good, and - dare I say it - it's not even chocolate. I'd skip the dinner in favor of drinks where you can enjoy the real reason for going - bachelorette party watching.",

I can't have MSG (gives me terrible migraines), so I was sure to ask the waiter if any of their items contain MSG. He replied that pretty much everything on the menu is made with MSG, and gave me a few options that would work. This is really puzzling to me. MSG is typically a substitute for quality ingredients, and a cheap way to add flavor-what is it doing in $30 a plate Kung Pao Chicken? I wasn't overly thrilled with the selection offered to me, and ended up ordering sushi. $90 (for just me!!!) and a not very full stomach later I was wishing I had just ordered some white rice and grabbed some pizza or something on the strip. The sushi place up the street from my house is better (and better priced). None of my friends' meals looked spectacular either; I felt like I was at an overpriced PF Chang's. The waiter was very good, I would have left a bigger tip, but I don't like finding an automatic 20% tip already added to my bill. Sorry Tao, you are all hype and very little substance. Meh.",

    "text": "My friend and I stayed at the Venetian hotel apr 3/4 - easy elevator trip to Tao.  We took an early reservation at 5:30 to get to  7:30 show.  The visual/decor of the restaurant is stunning, low lights, asian-pacific, tasteful and romantic.  Not many folks there at 5:30 which was fine.  The food in general was good, and the service was excellent.  I had a tequila and cucumber cocktail that was fabulous.  My soy-ginger salmon was heavenly!  The one disappointment was when my friend ordered the kobe beef skewer with shitaki mushrooms.  (She had never had kobe beef before, and not knowing better she ate a portion of it, along with the mushrooms- and remarked that it was \"good\").  I tried it and found it flavorful but chewy - something that kobe beef should never  be.  By the time we were able to point this out to the server, it was time for us to leave for our show and there was no time to order something else. No adjustment on the tab, either!  Lesson:  Don't order kobe beef unless you know the restaurant knows \"kobe\" beef.",

I am not a sushi lover but there were plenty of wonderful selections of other items. Made our reservations in advance through open table and were seated promptly at the appointed time. Our server was fantastic. Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. He made drink and wine suggestions and also brought me a sample of a wine he thought I might like since they didn't carry the one I asked for. These are the items we ordered: Pan Fried Dumplings filled with Chicken Gyoza with Napa Cabbage and Soy Dipping sauce, Imperial Vegetable Egg Roll, Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables, Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles, and we were graciously presented with the Giant Fortune Cookie which is filled with White and Dark Chocolate Mousse for dessert as we were celebrating an anniversary. The decor is absolutely fabulous. You feel like you are in an exotic Asian wonderland. There is a giant Buddah in the dining room with a koi pond underneath. The restaurant has a lot of energy and is noisy. It's an exciting adventure both visually and culinary to visit Tao.",

The decor is very modern and the low hanging lamp shades also create an eastern influence which sort of sets the right kind of atmosphere for an asian bistro. We were there at 6 pm and even though most tables were empty the staff scrambled to get us seated. Most of the tables had a reserved sign on them and many of them were unoccupied during our entire time there so even though we did have a reservation I find it hard to digest that it could take them 15 minutes to get us seated at a time like 6 pm. Coming to the food - we ordered the chilean sea bass satay (on recommendation by the waiter) and peking duck. Both were disappointing. The waiters seem to be in rush to get us out of there so hurried us through our dinner which was annoying. I'd not visit this place again on any future trip to Las Vegas.",

Bottle service at the club was a total rip off, certainly not worth the 400 bucks.  We had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old staircase I've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). We were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  They looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. Also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. We had to track down security to ask them to leave. Anyway, the environment was so lame and I was so irritated that I drank waaaay to much (so I wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). I blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the Encore. I was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. Being in Vegas with no ID, wonderful, let me tell ya. Needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. If you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place. I don't understand why it gets so much press, it's a real dump. Now I know why they have to pay celebs so much to go here.  If they weren't getting paid, they wouldnt be caught dead here.  And as far as sushi goes, if you want an impressive meal, head to Nobu or Sushi Roku (see my review). My next nightclub experience will probably be at XS, it looks waaaay better.",

My hubby had the wok-seared New York sirloin w/ shiitake mushrooms and szechwan potatoes - my GOD can you say SALTY! it was a heart attack waiting on a plate! I did not want to eat too much so I ordered their shrimp tempura and scallop tempura w/ a side of Jasmine rice. My husband thought the dish would come out w/ at least four of each...but I was right it came out w/ 2 of each. We paid $4 for each shrimp and $4.50 for each scallop...granted they were cooked perfectly, but probably would not pay that again. And the rice was $5 for a tiny small bowl of rice.  The only things I would probably pay for at this restaurant are the desserts. (That's what the 2 stars are for.) My hubby had the crispy fuji apple blossoms w/ tahitian vanilla ice cream and I had the sugar dusted doughnuts. I'm a HUGE critic (period), but desserts I critique much more! And the desserts at Tao were @ least pretty good- enough to pay for them again. After that...we went into their nightclub area...my co-worker was right, this place is WAAAYYY overrated! Unless you've got money to burn on getting your own booth, good luck with trying to find a designated dancing area...because there isn't one! But at least I can say I've tried it and will definitely NOT do it again.",

For drinks, I had the Tao-hito, which unfortunately just tasted watered down. Also, the decor is well done, as has been mentioned before, the 30-foot Buddha wall is sweet. The service was great once the food started coming, but previous to that it was slow and it took some time to get our drinks. Lastly, if you go with a group, you may want to limit it to six people only because we had to cram in eight sizable guys around a table designed for six. There were other tables which would've worked, but the majority seemed setup for six.",

The place was grossly overpriced so you're really just paying for the atmosphere. My fiancee and I were extremely let down and the place did not live up to the hype. Our hostess said that our dinner ($185 mind you) guaranteed entrance to the nightclub after but, of course, incompetent doormen & nightclub managers had no idea what we were promised an hour earlier. Save your money and go somewhere else! A group of our friends who made it in the club were split up since women were the only ones allowed upstairs. My fiancee and myself, on the otherhand, refused paying to go in since dinner was terrible and their word meant close to nothing. Honestly, if you want good asian food then go to an Asian restaurant, not an asian-themed restaurant. If you want a better Vegas experience take your spouse to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for dinner @ Caesars and the Mix @ Mandalay (the Hotel) for after dinner lounging and drinks, where at both places you'll be deeply satisfied.",

Three of us waited 1 hour on a Monday night to eat here, which wasn't really a problem since we sat at the bar for that hour, but it was also 10 PM!! We made friends with the bartender who was a really cool, down to Earth girl who shared stories of celeb sightings and poured plenty of alcohol in our drinks to make them worth $15 (she also told us about the bizarre rules that Tao had for their staff, only to be expected at a hot Vegas spot). By the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. She forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. I sampled a few things - the duck spring rolls which were ok, the coconut shrimp which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi and sashimi which was again - just OK. Anything else we had was not memorable. Like I said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is Vegas! But I could've drank the \"Geisha Girl\" martini all night. I definitely won't be back there to eat but would consider going for a few cocktails or hitting the nightclub.",

There's a huge Buddha statue that's in the middle of the restaurant and it was pretty cool that they sat us in front of it. The servers and waitresses are quick and attentive. No complaints there, However, the food is another story.  I'd reccomend coming here for the experience and to lounge around but don't expect too much for the food. Out of the 5 dishes that we ordered, 2 were decent and 1 was a mochi dessert tasting. The sushi was kinda meh, but the postickers and shrimp lobster spring roll were tasty. I enjoyed the mochi tasting a lot, definitely a few unique flavors along with your usual chocolate and strawberry.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience that if you got some time and money to spend, I'd recommend trying.",

When we arrived we had about half of our party there while waiting on 4 others. We were told to wait and that we needed everyone to be seated. When everyone was finally there we were sat immediately in the second floor. Very nice and relaxed ambiance but yet very classy. As we scrambled through the menu we asked for recommendations. Our server mentioned what was a chefs selections of foods. Depending on how much we want to pay per person is how high the quality of food is. Starting from $70 up to $120 per person. Our server did mention the food portions remain the same as she mentioned we would be \"getting pounded with food\" but only the quality is what changes. We all agreed on $90 per person being very reasonable so we went with that. From Exotic sushi to lobster to Wagyu beef to Ribs. We had it all. It was so much good we couldn't finish a single serving between all 8 of us. The food and service was amazing! The price point is fair considering the quantity and quality of food here. If you are in Vegas for a night out looking for a dinner to remember then you must check this place out!",

The entrance is located inside the Venetian near the entrance to the gondola shops. They also have a cute little TAO gift shop. The entrance to TAO is a dark tunnel with pools with rose petals, so purdy! We sat on the main floor in front of the budda.   I was pleased to see they have a couple of my favorites. The dragon tail spare ribs, and the sandpot! The waiter asked if we have ever been to TAO before, which I responded of course! I asked if he had any favorites, and he liked the coconut shrimp. Like a creature of habit I went for my favorites. The coconut shrimp is an entree but we ordered it as an appetizer. It was so good! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the coating was crispy. Next we got the dragon tail ribs! They were so good and meaty! They were so tender you can eat them with a fork! When we were received our sandpot I noticed something strange, no lobster?! I asked the waiter and they prepare it a little different then in NYC. They de-shell the lobster and let it saute in the garlic sauce. Either way it was still delicious. It was also a plus not to have to work at my food LoL.  So in good TAO fashion, its dessert time! You can not go to TAO and NOT get the fortune cookie! So good! It's a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla mousse on one side and vlchocolate mousse on the other, and served with fresh fruits. All in all a good time was had by many! This place should be a must on your next visit!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently came here for an early Christmas celebration dinner. Yes it was pricey, but hey that's the strip for ya. Ambiance wise this place was outstanding. The decor is beautiful and elegant, but also trendy. The music was definitely more club like, but not too unbearably loud like some other restaurants tend to be.  As for the food, wow, delicious. We started with the tuna tartare small plate to share. The tuna was a bit spicy, but not too overpowering and I loved the different textures. We also shared the crispy thai pork and spring mountain roll. The pork was absolutely delicious! It came with mushrooms, onions and peppers also mixed in. The sushi roll was good, but nothing outstanding. Can't forget dessert too! I'm typically not one for fortune cookies, but this giant beast was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the fresh fruit garnish and vanilla cream filling.  A great date night spot for when you're looking to splurge a little bit. I highly recommend the tuna tartare on crispy rice and crispy thai pork!",

We brought our own wine and were ready for a good evening. So far, so good.  Sitting in the lounge, no one asked if we wanted a drink or needed anything. Fail.   After zero service in the lounge we became impatient and my wife took the wine we brought to the bar to have them open it so we could start enjoying our evening.  About ten minutes later (still no help at the bar) the pager went off.  I went to the hostess and said we were waiting on our wine.   My wife waited at the bar and was finally told the corkage fee was $50. Really steep for a non-Michelin place, but not the point.  About another 10 minutes later still no service.  Ridiculous.   After waiting another 5 minutes my wife finally had to ask for our bottle back so we could leave.  Fail.   After speaking to the manager, the response was, \"if you'll stay I'll make sure you're taken care of.\"  We didn't want anything but the manager made no attempt to address the concern and just made some promise of satisfaction.  Fail.   We won't be back.   Fortunately, we were able to order delivery from JC Cuisine and had great food (in the pic)... for less than the Tao corkage fee",

We were a large group and told the waitress/waiter (they switched half way through) that we were going to split the check into two, half for one side of the table, half for the other. We thought this would make it easier, but turned out to be a disaster.  As you can see on the picture, they over charged on some things and then the same item they charged a different price for on a separate line item. We already sent the check back once cause of an inconsistency, and we were rushing out the door to a concert, so I just looked to see if they included everything we ordered as opposed to how much they charged. Lesson learned for sure. The actual food is good, as always. They did take off the cod and replaced it with seabass which is def not as buttery and I will probably not get again.",

The fish was huge and very sweet, served with some veggies drenched in sauce/oil.  I also ordered a wine to go with my meal; it was just okay.  This sounds picky, but the wine glass it came in was the same as a crappy set I owned in college.  I couldn't help feeling like I was back at a college party.  A restaurant that expensive could afford a nice wine glass at least.  My husband got the Seared Ahi Tuna (~$35), and they were really salty.  The tuna itself wasn't great; you could hardly taste it.  On a side note, if you eat at the restaurant you can get in to the night club as a VIP - just ask the waitstaff to get your wrist stamped.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Vegas celebrating our recent marriage and we made reservations at Tao for dinner. We were staying at the Venetian, so it seemed appropriate that we went here for dinner, plus we heard you get free access to Lavo (the other club at the Palazzo) if you eat there.  We had 8:30 reservations and when we got to the place on a Tuesday night, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The place did not seem that crowded, especially for a weeknight. Anyways, once we were seated, we told the waiter about the reason for our trip and he said we would be taken care of! After browsing the menu we settled on Filet Mignon Pepper Steak ($35) and Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken ($19) and we each had a specialty cocktail. The Filet Mignon pepper steak might have been the best thing I have ever eaten. It was fabulous. I know it was my husband's favorite meal of the entire trip. I mean, pepper steak from most chinese restaurants is pretty good, but then when you add filet mignon to the dish- it takes it to a whole new level! The pad thai was pretty good too, but the star of the meal was the pepper steak.  After our meal, our waiter brought us over 2 glasses of champagne and we weer able to choose a dessert for free. We selected the Yuzu Sugar Dusted Donuts with a trio of 3 dipping sauces. OMG these were amazing. They were warm and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The dipping sauces made this dessert extra special.   We had great service here, the decor was very romantic and I would definitely go back to this place next time I am in Vegas!",

    "text": "So after promising myself I wouldn't come back to Tao to eat, here I am again with my fiance because it was 1130 pm at night and Tao is one of the few restaurants still open. Unless you want to eat McD or Panda Express of course...which ain't nothing wrong with that.   We got good service but the waiter was SO PUSHY about ordering drinks. Sir, it's almost midnight and we plan to go to bed after this meal, we do not want your specialty rose flavored cat sake no matter if it's in season!   We ordered:  Chicken gyoza pan fried - super delicious. Great with the barely sweet soy sauce it came with.  Beijing duck for two - freshly sliced duck with crispy skin and crisp scallions on the side. Plum sauce was good and did not overwhelm. moo shi pancakes were freshly made and melted in your mouth.   So a good meal, although it is a bit pricy for the value of the food. I don't know what it is about Tao, but it's also busy so it takes FOREVER to get your food. We got our appetizer in 25 min and then another 20 min wait for the duck after that.   Kept our waters refilled and our dishes cleared. I guess I'd come back again for lunch, dinner just takes too long.   Very very loud and dark.",

I got some sushi that I can't remember. I think it was the angry dragon and a spicy shrimp roll with asparagus. Both were just okay. Some of my buddies got the black pepper filet mignon with udon noodles. How would I describe it? salty! It was like they poured in some soy sauce and decided to leave the bottle titled while they cook the food. That dish was dissapointing. Maybe we got some bad dishes, but gotta be more consistent than this!  Service was pretty good, but the food was meh. Go here if you want entry into the club. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.",

This is one of those dishes that when you taste it, your eyes roll backwards and all you can say is Oh.... My God. It is that good.... No lie. I like the restaurants decor with its upscale/trendy/Asian style. High ceilings that create a feel of openness. Interesting art, sculptures and artifacts that adorn the walls. This place offers everything you would expect to find in a 5 star restaurant. Excellent service,innovative gourmet food and fine dining. Expect to spend a lot of moola.",

My Vegas trip was early December and my bridesmaids and I chose this spot to come after our Chip and Dale's show to keep the party going.  what a buzz kill.   We had reservations and they stuck us under a fan/vent/ i dont know what and it was so cold. They did try to change the temperature which was very accommodating of them but it didn't make a difference. They didn't offer to move us away from the vent.   The food was not good... like at all, I tried really hard to like this place because we were all in such high spirits but I could see how progressively we were just getting more tired of TAO   I didn't have a drink but my bridesmaids weren't wowed (I mean for what your paying there, should you be?) and the food wasn't even half-way good.. the waiter got bombarded with large parties and it took forever to get out of there.   All in all I have to say as a New Yorker there are so many delicious options in terms of dining out no matter where you are (times square included) you could always find a reliable high rated yelp no matter your location but I noticed Las Vegas just plain sucks for dining out.   Most yelp ratings for these places are all 3 star averages and Peppermill was not good it was just excess.. the only redeeming food establishment was the delicious Tacos el Gordo which deserves 5 + stars.   Save your  money and go elsewhere TAO stinks. I've had better chinese take out.",

It's my second time here and it was much like the first, fun because both times were celebrations and I enjoyed the company I was with but other then that this place is beyond OVERRATED and I wouldn't come here on my own accord.  I had the orange chicken which honestly could have come from PF Changs where I would have gotten more and paid much less.  Didn't bother with drinks because I'm just not willing to spend $14 for a drink.  Waitress also tried to overcharge us for something that was her mistake and acted like she would try and fix it.  She did but acted like it was big deal.  I thought the large fortune cookie dessert was the best part of the evening.  Very creative and shared with a group of seven.  Some would recommend this place for date night but I probably wouldn't unless you like yelling to be heard.",

But I know the staff has a lot to do here so I'll do my best not to be a bitch.  I would give this place a 3, but after 2 drinks and 2 entrees I ended up paying 100 dollars.

I didn't except it to be dark and the ac was on full blast. The music was really noisy. We got the 3 course meals where there are 5 dishes in each course.  I didn't like half the food they served us; they were either too dry or there was too much seasoning. Chinese Sausage Fried Rice was decent. Wok-seared New York Sirloin was ok... alittle bit charred. After we were waiting for the bill, it was like 30 mins later they arrived with the bill. When we were leaving the exit was filled with people at the bar. I don't understand why the bar is so close to the front... My experience was horrible. I will not be going there again. 2.5/10",

It's the desserts that were killer; Mochi Ice Cream (Great) and a bread Pudding that had a Carmel sauce that was off the hook - WOW! (we joked that it must have cocaine in it it was so great!).

My dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  There were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  The hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  The waitress that took our cocktail orders was sweet, and she made some great Taojitos for the group!  At 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.  Dinner was amazing once we were seated.  Chris was our server and took great care of us.  We enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck spring rolls, and eggplant tempura.  We also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, pad thai with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, spicy eggplant, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fired rice.  It's two days later, and I am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (Usually I would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  We literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!  Luckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  Chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  I'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like AJ's in AZ).  It had \"Happy Birthday A & Z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.    I didn't pay the bill, and I'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and I'm sure it was worth it!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, Tao was amazing!  Beautiful ambiance too - I'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!",

    "text": "Best. Asian Fusion. Restaurant. Of. My. Life. ( ! )  Tao Restaurant is located inside Venetian and has such a decadent interior, with red and dark hues and Buddha statues everywhere. I find absolute culinary perfection at Tao Restaurant, and I will be more than happy to explain why.  My three girl friends and I decided to spend New Years Eve together. But what can we do when NYE is in less than 36 hours? Where we go that isn't too far from home, yet not so close? Where can we party til the sunrises?   SIN CITY!   *Ding, ding, ding, DING!*  Who would have known the four of us were locked, loaded, and ready to go within 12 hours after saying yes. After three and a half hours of driving, we finally arrived.  we made managed to sweep dinner reservations just a few hours beforehand. After we finished dolling up for the big night, we spent the next hour finding parking at the Venetian parking lot. The staff was kind enough to hold our reservations, even though we were 30 minutes late.   When we got to the restarant, we were greeted by a female hostess, who seated us immediately. She was HAWT (full blown double dees and a badonkadonk). We were given warm towels to wipe our hands and given menus. We started off with a Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce ($10) as an appetizer.  Please do yourself a great favor and order these two items:  - Crispy Filet of Red Snapper with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce ($29) - Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34)  Both plates were cleaned completely. If I was home alone, I would have licked the plates off.   Shame on you if you don't try these two dishes out!  In my 23  years of existence, I have never EVER ordered fish from a restaurant because I was born a lean, mean, meat-eating machine. However, after my wonderful experience at Tao, I've opened up my palete and ventured into fish entrees.  One of my friends ordered the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings ($36), which is just okay, but not nearly as delectable as the sea bass and red snapper. I'd have to delete one star for that because at that price, I would expect it to taste better.   All of the cocktails are $12.5. Try the Blue Zen (Cruzan Citrus, Malibu Rum, Blue Curacao, Pineapple Juice).  The desserts range from $9-12. Our waiter highly recommended the Giant Fortune Cookie (filled with white and dark chocolate mousse). Four people can share this.   Every bite of the red snapper, sea bass, and giant fortune cookie were sensually pleasing to the palette. The only words we can utter were \"mmms\" and \"ahhhs\" throughout the entire meal.   I have yet to try the sushi the next time I come here again. Hopefully, it will be soon.",

I didn't know about this secret the first time I ate there and had wound up ordering the sea bass, which I found to be overly hyped.  The tasting menu consists of a multi-course meal of items selected by the chef depending on your food preferences and your price point ($60-$120 per person).  If you're in town for a short time and don't see yourself visiting again any time soon, the tasting menu is what to request!",

HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.    My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).    After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long \"special line\" and then wait in another \"special line\" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.

    "text": "Ok when I think about restaurants on the strip I generally don't think I'm going to have any sort of meal that is satisfying, tastes out of this world and is not pretentious. Tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. Don't judge until you've tried.   I've come to Tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. Not really...cos both times I wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. Note to self: DO NOT wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps.   I digress...I digress...back to Tao. Contrary to popular belief, both times I was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on Saturday nights. As you enter Tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if I had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis I would go take plonk myself in one of these. They look that zen and inviting.   This latest visit I made to Tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. Lychee Martinis...I made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. A great start to the night. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. He knew exactly what went in each dish. Tao is also very vegetarian friendly. They can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. Ok now to the dishes:  1. Shishito Peppers - Yum Yum...very nice and interesting. Never had these before. I probably wouldn't order these if I didn't have more than 4 people in my party. Rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites  2. Sake Infused Mushrooms - OK I am going to go insane right now. This was soooo good....i HATE sake and I'm salivating all over my laptop right now. I can't even describe this dish. You just need to get it. NEED TO I tell you  3. Steamed Veggie Dumplings - The dumplings itself were pretty normal. Nothing out of the regular dumpling world. Don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although I guess I already have). Now, the dumplings came with this AMAZING crunchy cucumber side. Ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. Sounds icky but Yum Yum Yum. Very very nice...  4. Fried Brown Rice with Veggies - Wow. Crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating brown rice (I don't like brown rice). Tastes sooo good. This is literally the best fried rice I've had outside of Asia. And I've eaten many a fried rice  5. Mango Tamarind Martini - This one tasted sooooo good. Masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. A perfect complement to the meal. The drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"  We ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. I'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so I can't really remember how it tasted. The girls seemed to like it though.   We even got our hands stamped to get into Tao (the club area) after we ate. Totally worth the price!  If you are in Vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip I would suggest Tao for sure. Great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful.",

I saw a picture of a shrimp plate on their website and knew I wanted that because it works with my diet, I ordered an appetiser plate of the crispy Thai shrimp thinking it was what was on the picture, however that was not it. However what I got which was stuffed shrimp in a fried wrap similar to an eggrog was devine. Others in my party ordered Chillean sea bass, lobster wontons, and other delish looking dishes and they said it was all excellent. I capped off the night with a pot of green tea which was great. I love Asian food and I highly recommend Tao to anyone.",

I went on a Sunday (holiday weekend) and the wait was about 30 minutes. We had a drink in the lounge area so it wasn't bad. The music and ambiance were perfect. Once we were seated, we had nothing but GREAT service. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and our food came out super fast. We ordered the lobster wontons, the trio of sashimi with wasabi salsa (I'm not a big fan of wasabi, but this was sooo good!), sea bass with asparagus, and the chef's roll. Everything we ordered was delicious, however the chef's roll was okay.  Again, the servers there were great. It was a team effort. If another server saw that we had a question or had finished our plates, he/she would come right away. Anyway, if you're looking for a restaurant that has great food plus a fun and fresh atmosphere, Tao is perfect.   P.S - I took off one star because this place is a little pricey and the portions are a bit small too.",

    "text": "Just got back from a weekend in Vegas and a second visit to Tao.  I think the crux of the issue here is that it's a restaurant AND a nightclub.  So, you get (what is in my opinion) some pretty decent Asian Fusion cuisine and attentive service in the restaurant marred by the typical nightclub attitude - \"self-important\" is the phrase that comes to mind.  First and foremost, be sure not to stand in the wrong place.  My group of four were informed not to stand where we were standing three separate times in the first 20 minutes at the venue.  The first was when we were in line to check in for our 9pm reservation behind some other folks that were taking an impossibly long time at the host stand to notify the host of their arrival.  A \"welcome to Tao\" would have been nice but instead it was more like \"be sure to stand to the left if you have a dining reservation.\"  Gee, thanks.  After being informed at the host stand that they were running \"a little behind,\" we headed to the bar to grab some drinks.  The end of the bar was open so we headed over there, but very shortly after ordering our $50 round we were informed by another bouncer that we couldn't stand at that side of the bar.  I informed him rather indignantly that we wouldn't even be in the bar in the first place if they were able to seat us in a timely fashion for the reservation we'd made a month ago.  So I took my time signing the check and then we headed to another area of the bar where we were told yet again not to stand where we were standing.  Things got better once we were finally seated at our table - fortunately it was only a 15 minute delay which was marginally acceptable (in my opinion, any material delay when a reservation is involved should warrant some free drinks).  I do like the food here, even though several of the menu options are somewhat uninspiring (read: Kung Pao Chicken).  The sushi is good but overpriced and the shabu shabu is fun but easily recreated at home.  I think the small plates are probably where the best options lie, but you do need to order several of them to make a meal.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive - a nice contrast to the police state that was the bar area.  It was the food and ambience that brought me back a second time but I think I can find something comparable in Las Vegas on a future visit,  somewhere where they care a little more about friendly service and are not focused so much on cattle-herding the club kids.",

    "text": "Group of 5 ladies, came here on a Saturday night during the 4th of July holiday. First of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. Had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. We would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. The waiting area was blaring with loud EDM music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. Meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. We were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, Lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. The night started off quite weak. Once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. At least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. Nice view of the big Buddha statue in the center. Food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried chicken gyoza, the lobster wontons and the rock shrimp lettuce cups were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. My cousins miso sea bass entree was good. Strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. Big portion of chicken pad thai by someone else. I dont like pad thai or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. Looked big and fresh. I split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. Was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. It was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but I have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. The table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. The waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. In this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from Lavo, was thankfully shining through here at Tao as well. A nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. As I said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as Lavo used to do. Will continue nightclub review in other yelp page.",

We walked right in got a table pager and grabbed drinks at the bar. We sat at the cute little booth and chatted for less than 5 minutes when our pager started to buzz.   We were seated next to the giant Buddha water fountain. Very nice decor! I ordered the Crispy Orange Chicken which was delish and my gal ordered the Black Pepper Filet Mignon with those yummy Udon Noodles add a side of rice and call me satisfied cause I liked it!   We asked our waiter what time the party started and he said sorry ladies no party on Tuesdays. Boo! But he was nice enough to offer stamps to their sister club at the Palazzo Lavo (more on that later).   After we ordered our server kinda disappeared and then we got a new guy who brought out our food and then the bill. We had to ask about the Lavo pass again. The manager came over and stamped our hands and that was it. This server weirdness is minus one star in my book.   Okay about the bathrooms- they are not labeled male and female.

The quality of the food is great, I'd definitely recommend the sashimi plates; we had both the salmon and yellowtail (the salmon was definitely my favorite!).  I also recently became a fan of uni but I have to admit at $8 a pop for 1 piece, it can become a pricey addiction. =\\ But it was a very large piece, and very fresh!  Also had their signature tapas dish -- sea bass with asparagus.  It was a bit salty; we needed to eat it with the roast duck fried rice we ordered to tone it down.  That was the only negative of the meal.  We did not order a main entree but what we did order was the perfect amount for the two of us.  Bill came out to be about $100 and we didn't order any cocktails, which seems about average for a restaurant like this.   Good service and a nice ambience.  Extremely busy on weekends so without a reservation you may be waiting a while to get seated.  Overall a pleasurable dining experience. =)",

The pad tai noodles seemed really dry and were missing some major flavor. Didn't try the Lo Mein, but heard it was good although it didn't look very appetizing. Kinda hoped service would make up for the food, but that too, was just ok. I felt like I had to yell to talk to anybody at the table 'cause it was a bit loud in there.

Taojitos and Taotinis flowed while waiting for our entrees.  the orange chicken was good, nothing over the top.  the coconut prawns  were huge and well worth the wait.  chicken with veggies and jasmine rice weren't anything to brag about either.  $50+ per girl was expected in the Venetian, but in the real world nothing was spectacular about the meal.  they did bring out a giant fortune cookie filled with pastry cream and topped with fresh fruit and chocolate drizzle for the bday girl, a definite added plus to make good on the hour wait.  as a bonus you get in free to the club for dining first, but make sure to get the *line pass* stamp before leaving your table!!!",

Vegas was better in terms of service: arrived on time for our reservation and seated immediately and the servers were friendly, efficient, and extremely attentive. The atmosphere and decor is interesting and fun, and plenty of big tables for large groups.   On the other hand, Tao Las Vegas is not so good with the food. Same menu and in fact, we ordered several of the same dishes(salmon nigiri, peking duck spring rolls, chilean sea bass, black pepper filet mignon with udon) but they just didn't taste fresh and as the hubby says \"it tastes very Vegas\" (translation: food made for the masses). It's a fun place for the ambiance but if you are there for the cuisine, there are too many other great places in Vegas to try. I will save my next visit to Tao for my next trip to NYC.",

Food:  the appetizers that people raved about on here weren't on the menu, my broiled snapper arrived way too fast and barely warm. I suspect it was precooked and heated slightly before it arrived in front of me. And the taste?  If I wasn't starving I would have sent it back.  No fortune cookie either.

I think they know that people will come anyway so they don't care about the customer service or involving with the guest to understand their needs. But what they fail to realize is that on an average you are paying approx. $60 per guest if not more and that for sure calls for a good customer service. They also force you to pay a minimum 20% tip by asking you to presign your check instead of letting you decide what tip you want to give based on the service.  Overall, this is not a place where I would take a delegate to.  Food selection is also redesigned but food was ok, as you would expect in an Asian bistro.",

He was so friendly, nice, helpful, and excited. Whenever we asked about certain dishes, he'd go \"The seabass is RIDICULOUS!\" .. and it sure was! He was so attentive to us 15 girls. Jeffrey needs to get paid more :) haha.  So, I'm Chinese and I typically get disappointed when dining at any non-traditional Chinese restaurants (like PF Changs, eh gross. Too salty). Tao had RIDICULOUSLY tasty food without being too salty. My favorite was the salmon, seabass, garlic noodles, and the filet mignon pepper steak (omg the meat was SO tender and juicy!). For dessert, we ordered the chocolate zen parfait. It had layers and layers of different chocolate flavors. My favorite layer was one with chunks of waffles in it.   The restaurant was fancy too. Love the decorations!",

Service - four stars (possibly got lucky on the waiter)  ALL of the top items were sweet. Even the waiter admitted that was an issue. Squab with lettuce wraps, Spicy Tuna Tartare, Satay of Chilean Sea bass, Chinese five spice short ribs....   Us chefs know you can pander to a wider crowd by adding sugar and/or salt to your \"sauce\" and he did EXACTLY that and too much of it. Makes the sauces now \"superficial\" so to speak.  SUMMARY - Frankly not much to say about it which is quite sad. We REALLY wanted it to work.",

For a main course, the menu in general is good, but the stand out is the crispy orange chicken (with brown rice). The flavor & texture is perfect. I could eat this dish daily.",

PROS- I don't know why I'd think of a place I'd have to *find* something good to list - when I clearly would never return...but here goes: .... uh....nice decor.  CONS - the worst dining experience I've gotten in my life and I've been around the world, at every level and star of restaurant. I am also a very good tipper. I've been known to tip people exorbitantly when I thought service was good. But I left a $0 tip. Why?  - Can you say ATTITUDE? Waiter had zero eye contact, zero smile. He buried his face into his notepad and had his pen poised to take our orders. What would you ladies like? When we were too slow to answer (a few seconds, I'd say), he trots off with a huff \"I'll give you a few more minutes\"...well thank you for doing US the favor.   - I asked him to leave the drink menu behind, did he? No. He actually *snatched* it off the table. Good thing, too...the martinis were $13 and SUCKED. I could have made better in a plastic cup. I am glad I didn't order any more.   - The food: $26 for a skimpy piece of salmon on a bed of Japanese udon noodles. It was tiny. Salty as hell. I tasted my companion's meal and it was so salty I couldn't eat it all, neither could she. It gave me diarrhea the next day.   - We asked for separate checks but at the end of dinner, got one tab.  I asked another waiter about it and he turned his nose up at me and said \"we don't do separate tabs here\"...sheesh, well EXCUSE ME. I told him I needed my tab for work, compliments ala United States Government and he changed his tune a bit, so we did get two separate tabs in the end, but not without attitude.  Other Cons:   - loud as hell. Welcome to dining in the equivalent of someone's car with the stereo blasting.  - front desk staff = zombies'  - did I mention loud as hell? Its OK for a nightclub but not for a restaurant :-(  OVERALL IMPRESSION of the place = NOT WORTH THE HYPE  Would I go back = never.",

Reservation was for 6pm, right before their dinner rush during CES, a very busy time in Vegas.  We arrived exactly on time and the restaurant was almost empty, so there was no excuse for their placing us in the worst seat in the house, directly overseeing the commotion below from the second floor at a narrow aisle where everyone would have to pass by on the way to their tables - imagine an aisle seat on an airplane.  I looked down at the first floor and saw plenty of tables with booths we could have been given, so I was starting to get agitated.  I looked up at the third floor and saw empty tables where we also could have been placed.  Strike one.  We ordered our dinner, a pricey sea bass and an even pricier lobster dish - the most expensive item on the menu at fifty bucks.  My dish arrived and was basically a sloppy mix of smelly spoiled lobster (very obviously not served fresh) mixed with fried potatoes and popovers and a ton of cilantro on top to cover it the way a cat covers its poop when it is finished.  Hers was an overly sweet sea bass slathered in sugar.  I have had to crack open lobster dozens of times in the past but was given the tiniest shell cracker to de-shell with.  Strike two.  I complained to the manager and was offered free dessert or champagne and declined both - I didn't want anything for free - I wanted what I asked for.  He could have offered to relocate us and did not.  Strike three.  I am never coming back!",

The entrance is dark and romantic with pools of rose water and candles. The interior is ancient sheik.  My waiter was helpful and I chose some sushi, The Spring Mountain roll. It was beautiful, fresh and well made but I have had better tasting sushi.  My entree was the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea bass which I tried for the first time in Vegas and liked.  This is a very hip sheik, expensive restaurant will beautiful Asian decorations. My plane was leaving so I didn't know about their attached night club which I could have gotten into for FREE!!!!!",

The service was great along with the manager checking if everything was ok. We had drinks and wine sushi and spring rolls. Be careful when ordering it turned out to be a lot of food!

Unfortunately, it was near impossible to find a server, and there was no one checking on us either.

I had already been before, but it had been a while and it was for clubbing purposes only, so i had forgotten how pretty (and DARK) it was inside. There was a slight line, but i had reservations so i didn't have to wait for a table. It was pretty crowded (but it was a Friday in Las Vegas so duh). so our table was slightly cramped but no big deal.  I ordered shrimp tempura, and california rolls. My mother also ordered some sushi(can't remember which ones) but everything was good,  My dad had some spare ribs that were extremely tender(i got a piece off his plate) and my brother ordered the Thai Duck fried rice-which was so good, he ordered another and I ordered one for myself.   So because I checked into Tao via Yelp I received a free ginormous fortune cookie for dessert. It was filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse and very yummy. And because our waiter was so nice, he brought a second one free of charge with candles to celebrate my mom's birthday. Very cool. She enjoyed it and it made her bday memorable-and solidified my position as her coolest child.",

Stationed overseas for 4 years I've had the luxury of experiencing and enjoying varieties of sushi and Japanese cuisine from Tokyo to Osaka. With high expectations and standards I expected nothing, but quality and taste for the appropriate price for the right food. (Especially being in the main spotlight of Vegas.) Sushi is expensive and in all Vegas is expensive, but charging 9 dollars for an instant miso soup deluged in hot water is beyond overpriced, but rather senseless. As for the main course I would compare it to Japan's dollar conveyor belt sushi resturaunts were they serve two large sushi for a dollar and the miso soup is actually miso soup! It's not Japan (I know) and no, the world is not running out of fish either. I say this not for my own health, but for next wallet waiting to be dipped in soy sauce.   But the resturaunt is kinda pretty.",

Duck fried rice for $15? Pad Thai for $19-22? For one person? I'm not one to look at the price but this place made me do it. I could go to any Asian restaurant for the same food but for less money and better taste.  We started the night with some tasty cocktails. I wanted to try Love Potion #9 (Grey Goose Cherry Noir, cranberry and lychee puree) but Angela H beat me to it so to be different,  I got a Dragon Slayer (Bacardi Dragonberry, Ginger liqeur, strawberry and togarashi spice) instead. Black Pearl ((Henessy Black, blackberries, yuzu and agave nectar). The drinks were pretty awesome!  Wasabi-Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura Onion Rings: This one was the best value for $38. Good and tender filet. However,  this one came with fat...and I'm not a fan of animal fat.  The wasabi crust was great and not overpowering/sinus-clearing. 3.5/5  Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck: The duck was great and overall this was good fried rice. But for $15 and a serving for 1 person? Not so much. 3/5  Lacquered Roast Pork: Chinese BBQ pork is what this is. You get about 7 slices of pork. I mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. Go to Chinatown instead. 2/5  The highlight of the evening was the dessert sampler. It was a huuuge plate with all kinds of crazy chocolate desserts. We had a chocolate mousse, a giant fortune cookie filled with cream and chocolate, ice cream, souffle, wontons with chocolate, fruits...CRAZY!",

I don't remember the food exactly, but I so remember myself saying that I would have been upset if I had paid for my meal.   Fast forward 4 years to October 24, 2013. I was invited to dinner for someone's \"birthday.\" I wasn't too thrilled it was being celebrated here since I don't remember having an awesome experience before. Restaurant is a bit cramped, but they do cater to very large parties. I wasn't too bothered by the lighting being dark, but I could see how it would bother other people who actually want to see their food. As for the noise level, it's located in a club, so expect it to be above normal. None of this really bothered me, it's the actual food that gets to me.  If I'm going to dish out $$$ for food, it better be spectacular. And Tao did not deliver. I ordered the sizzling rice with Peking duck. For the price I paid, I could have just made that myself. I also got to sample the other dishes my friends ordered, and I was not impressed by any of them. The highlight of the night was the dessert platter which I thought was yummy. There are so many other good places to eat in Vegas for way less money. I know for sure I won't be back.",

There wasn't much lobster and it was a bit chewy. We also had the crispy orange chicken which is usually awesome but this time it didn't seem as fresh. We also tried the Sea Bass which was actually very delicious which was the reason we gave an extra star instead of just one.

The lobster wantons were especially good as was the rice pudding with ginger icecream desert. I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is great. The waiter tried to upsell us on everything so we ended up paying for a bottle of Voss water but oh well. I knew it going in but this place is Dark and Loud! So if you're looking for a quiet meal this place is not for you.",

The atmosphere is very serene. Lighting is dim and creates a pleasing dinning experience. We got the Soy Ginger Glazed Salmon which was amazing. The crust was crisp and the noodles under the piece were fantastic. We also got the Yellowtail sashimi and the Soft Shell Crab roll. Both of those were excellent. Oh, and you can't forget the Crispy Thai Shrimp appetizer that had the shrimp inside an Eggroll type shell and came with really good sauce. The drinks were amazing as well. I got the Mango Tamarind Martini which was a lot different than anything I've ever drank and very tasty. We payed about $150 for 2 people, so it wasn't too bad. I'd definitely go back again for another special occasion!",

None of the reception area checked on us or anything, the only attention was from \"security\" guys managing flow by the door, telling us to get out of the way.  I know it may have been extra busy since Kim K was celebrating her b-day there, but we had booked long before that became public and no matter what goes on you should be able to manage your customers just the same. It was a bit of a mood killer among my group since we felt in the way and not welcomed....Not to mention waiting so long took the wind out of our sails for the evening. One redeeming thing is that they brought over some complimentary shots and appetizers to munch on, since we were all starved after our wait. The food was what to be expected, tasty but not worth the crowds and the hassle. The restaurant was not worth the wait.",

We had a nice bottle of wine, the Peking duck for two, black pepper filet mignon, and lo mein with roast pork.  The duck seemed a bit over-cooked, the filet mignon was excellent, and the lo mein was probably a poor choice and I'm pretty sure we've all had better at our local Chinese restaurants...  The waitstaff was friendly, albeit a bit slow because it was so busy, and the decor was really gorgeous.  A bit loud, but the nightclub is right upstairs so it's not surprising!  But the best part of the dining experience by far was the dessert!  We shared a truly awe-inspiring huge fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse, complete with a huge paper fortune inside.  Amazing and the main reason for the extra star!",

Our party of three had the peppers with yuzu appetizer (good, but I prefer a Spanish take on the peppers), Chilean sea bass satay (just as delicious as advertised), hot and sour soup (good), pork spring roll (excellent, with excellent sauce), five spice shortribs (pretty good), Thai chicken (delightful) and some sushi (quite good).

    "text": "I ate here at the bar with my sis-in-law since we were going to the club afterward. It turned out to be a great idea, not only for the convenience of being downstairs from the club, but also because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very fun. The decor was awesome and the layout of the bar/lounge was cool, except it gets really crowded before the club opens. Our bartender was on top of everything the entire time (except for one thing that I'll get to at the end for emphasis) and our food came at a reasonable pace. The sushi here is about average based on what we got. Some yellowtail sashimi and a special roll. Tasty, decent portions, the usual. I have loved this place ever since for two reasons: the sake menu is extensive and the kobe beef carpachio is incredible! It's the best I've ever had and I've been craving it ever since! We had a great time at the bar and had some good food for the price... it didn't seem all that expensive to me for what we got. All in all, a great start to the night.   Now here's the one thing that the bartender dropped the ball on and remember this if you eat there before the club:  Turns out you have to get a stamp from your server to get in upstairs. Even if you have a freakin receipt for $200 at that very place! So back to the bartender we go, then she says go to the front because she was busy I think. By then the front is getting slammed with bodies all wanting to get into the club so talking to the folks at the front was near impossible, not to mention maneuvering through the masses. So FINALLY after badgering the people at the front, and some nifty work by my sister getting in with another crowd already lined up for the stamp guy, we got em and were good to go. That's a whole 'lotta nonsense for a stamp I know and just remember to get yours when you pay for your meal. Lucky I didn't give 'em three stars for that cluster f#@$!",

If this was all done in a lower price range bracket (one step down will do) it would be a 5 star easy.  I guess when the bill crawls over the $100 mark for two people I need to be dazzled and super impressed with every category.  Ambiance, service and decor get 4 stars.  The food 3.  Coconut Shrimp was great but the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon was just OK.  The rating would actually be higher if I went on a Friday or Saturday since you get into their nightclub free if you order an entree and drinks.  Thats actually a pretty expensive perk considering their entrance fee is 40-50 bucks I think.",

Our server was nice but as other yelpers have mentioned the service is fast, so fast I feel like you can't really enjoy your evening. Bussers constantly hoover around like ninjas to clear items right away making me feel rushed but I'm sure its because they have a lot of reservations. Started with the King crab roll , very good and then we had the miso seabass and the duck fried rice. The seabass was so delicious just like butta!

    "text": "ok I know I'm late to review this.. I ate here at the end of March, but one of my friends just reviewed it and it got me craving this place again. I loved it so much I HAVE to say something!! I'm sorry my review comes 2 months late!   You walk into this place and it's just swanky and oozed coolness. I love the big Budda and the rest of the decor is funky as well. Loud ambient lounge/chill music could be heard overhead... I was so happy I was wearing a leopard print halter, otherwise I would have felt under dressed here.   Cosmos were fantastic! The sushi was excellent too. I have no idea where they fly the sushi in - as we were in the dessert, but it didn't matter it tasted fabulous and fresh! Pan seared Tuna was fantastic, but OMG the  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was to DIE FOR- I mean to DIE FOR. I still dream about it 2 months later.....   Bathrooms for me were confusing - the doors had a yin icon on one, and a yang on the other. I got to the door and though WTF, I should have kept up with my yoga class and maybe I would know this.... and while I was trying to decide which door I was going to bust through, some chick walked into Yin and I followed her. Later my friends nicely pointed out - had I not had 3 cosmos I might have noticed the female budda outside of the women's room as the clue... oooops who knew?  My take - this is a MUST visit place for dinner in Vegas. It will not disappoint, but make sure to make a reservation otherwise you will wait a long time! I made mine on open table a few weeks before my trip.",

    "text": "Not impressed.  I was very excited for this restaurant, amidst all the hype and reviews.  The big buddha especially was appealing.  We considering just popping by for the club at first, but decided we may as well just eat here instead.  Boy do I regret that.  First, the service.  For a high-scale, populous, touristy area such as where Tao is located, I would except only the best of service.  This started on the wrong foot, when my party was running 15 minutes late, and called out of politeness to notify and apologize to the restaurant like we always do.  Here's a first:  when I asked if our reservation could be pushed back by 15 minutes due to a slight delay, the hostess replied, \"15 minutes should be okay.. any later, and it's up to the manager's discretion on your reservation.\"  What?  What kind of BS rudeness is this.  I can understand that for a top-notch restaurant, space is limited and therefore any outrageously late reservations / no shows will be given to people who have been waiting for a seat.  But we were only 15 minutes late, and by the time we arrived, there was no one waiting in line.  That just added salt to the wound - if there had been an extremely long line with multiple aggravated parties waiting to be seated, sure.  But don't spout some BS to us over the phone and cause us to rush when it wasn't even needed with a passive aggressive threat to our reservation.  Also, during my reservation, we had requested a seat next to the large Buddha.  Granted, I understand requests are not always given, but it was for my girlfriend's graduation dinner, and the fact that there were empty seats around the Buddha when we passed by it made me wonder what exactly the manager does when training his employees on the ideals of service.  Nevertheless, we spoke up when they attempted to seat us in some dark corner, and waited while the hostess \"discussed\" with another our seating preferences, and reseated us after 2-3 minutes.    Moving on, the decor.  They get an additional star for this, otherwise this would have been a one-star review.  As a tourist, we love seeing flashy, new things - my camera is always ready in my hand.  First, they had multiple beautiful rose petal water baths in the entrance (for visual pleasure of course).  The light was dimly set, but not dark enough where you can't see a thing due to the illuminations of all the other decor.  Aside from the various Asian inspired ornaments we saw, the Big Buddha was again the most appealing factor of this restaurant.  Definitely bring a camera if you're the type who wants to see things like this - it'll be one of your only high points of the night.  Third, food.  Meh.  PF Changs puts the same amount of flavor, for 1/3 of the price.  It's basically just heavy MSG foods with some fancy names, and more expensive types of food such as lobster.  I won't go too deep into what we had, but our party had a variety of different types ranging from sushi rolls to lobster to fish.  The fish was the best - it was flaky, with a great texture and the right amount of sauce.  Everything else fell far below my expectations.    Fourth, price.  Ugh.  $35-$40 per entree.  And I feel as if I could get most of this from my local chinese take-out, minus some expensive stuff like lobster.  However, just because you offer a few expensive dishes doesn't mean you can charge premium price.  If the taste isn't there, it's not worth it.  If the service is subpar, it's not worth it.  I would have been fine with Tao, possibly giving it 3-4 stars, if these dishes are maximum $20.  But for what we got - a rehash of what we could get anywhere else, for up to $40+?  Hell no.  Summary:  Unless you really need to fill your tourist bucket list and see the Big Buddha, avoid this place.",

    "text": "I don't really understand what all the hype is about. After hearing about this place almost every time I visited Vegas, I was quite excited about getting invited to a meal at Tao the last time I visited. Unfortunately, I was kind of let down.   Don't get me wrong, the meal did have its high points and I saw a glimmer of what I had originally made this place out to be. They seated us relatively quickly for how absolutely packed the restaurant looked and a few of the dishes - particularly the albacore nigiri and green bean tempura - were pretty damn delicious. However, their jaunty service and sup-par special dishes left me wanting to come back for a do-over.   Although the wait to be seated at the door wasn't bad, trying to catch a server (of which we had two who seemed to be quite distracted with their myriad other tables) took us quite a while for both our drink and dinner orders. Upon flagging one down, we placed our order (a few of her recommended favorites in the mix), and waited for our dishes.  The appetizer course - lobster wontons, green bean/avocado tempura, pork potstickers - was decent. The crispy green bean tempura and delicious sauce on the lobster wontons far outshined the heavy avocado tempura and chewy, thick pork postickers. Having ordered the miso glazed sea bass, crispy orange chicken , fatty tuna and chinese sausage fried rice as our mains, we eagerly waited the next course. While all the dishes were alright, none of them really stood out or made me want to come back and eat it again (but maybe that's not even the point with a gargatuan place like Tao?). The miso sea bass (a restaurant favorite) was cooked well, but a bit sweet. The crispy orange chicken was the biggest upset, as the promise of crunchy, tangy chicken was everything but. Neither crispy, nor flavorful. At 15 dollars an order, I was really counting on the fatty tuna to be the star, but was let down by it being a little warm for fresh nigiri and kind of floppy. The chinese sausage fried rice was good, but nothing worth almost $20.   The saving grace came at the end of the meal in desert form. That was the one plate we cleaned entirely.The molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream... get this if you come here. As someone who just questioned above if they'd ever return, it almost made me want to come back for more.",

HOWEVER, the food was UHHMAAZINNGG!! I get sushi, because in my opinion its the best place ive been to in Vegas with great fresh sushi, and my hubby gets the filet, which is served sliced raw with a boiling scallion broth you cook to your own perfection!

I hardly finished when the person I was with entree came out. He was practically done with his entree, and then my sushi came. I love eating alone. I asked where my food was and why they brought out an entree when I just got my appetizer. They shrugged I think there are few menu items that everyone orders and they are practically cooking them every 5 minutes and they bring them out. I was very disappointed I knew the food would not be excellent but the service made it by far worse. I ordered a crab and salmon roll for my entree that was just average. the place was not even a good scene. The lady was supposed to come stamp our hands to go to the club and she never showed. Thew waiter reminded her again and she still never came. I actually saw the crowd heading in and thought it would be better idea if we passed anyhow. Not my scene at all  !",

You can tell they are highly trained to achieve top customer satisfaction. When the menu is this expensive, great service is a must, and Tao delivered in spades. The appetisers were amazing. We had some sushi rolls and tuna tartar. Both were outstanding. Good cocktail selection. Entrees were good, I have to deduct 1/2 star only because I felt my dish, the Hong Kong Shrimp, was lacking something to give it that wow factor. but that's a small, snobby detail. But I did try someone's steak stirfry, and THAT was amazing.   This place is not cheap, but you wound't come here if you were on a budget. If you are looking to have an expensive night to treat a special lady, or to have a great night with a group of friends where money is no object, this place shows you where your dollar goes. Love this place, a highlight of our trip.",

    "text": "I would never compare this place to PF Chang's. Do you see a puddle of grease or a pile of salt? Nope.   You must understand first that I have a serious problem when it comes to chocolate lava cake. All those kids down $1k at the poker tables got nothing on me and my lava cake. 6 months ago, I came to Tao for dinner and was the only one who wanted to get dessert (surprise, surprise). I ordered the lava cake for MYSELF because no one would split with me but I left for 15 min to pick up my friend from the hotel lobby and when I returned, the cake was GONE. Everything from the chocolate chopsticks to the ice cream and every drop of chocolate was G-O-N-E!!! My friends remind me as much as possible how delicious this cake was, and I've wondered about it ever since.  It's my last day in Vegas and I had yet to get my precious chocolate cake. After gorging myself on pounds of bacon wrapped fillet mignon and queso bread at a Brazilian Steakhouse, with just 20 min to make it to the Bellagio to see \"O,\" I called my order in and rushed over to Tao to pick up my precious lava cake. Gimme a break, it was my last chance!  I got dropped off at the lobby and ran in to pick up my order, but when I looked in the bag I noticed they didn't have plastic forks. What?! I guess I'm probably the only one who has ever ordered something to go, so I sat down at the bar to take just one bite. Yum... (No I did not use my hands).   My friend went to the bathroom so I decided to continue eating while I waited. So I'm sitting at the bar by myself eating chocolate cake out of a plastic box, with chocolate on my face, and 10 bartenders gawking at me.  Me: (Gorging myself with chocolate cake) Bartender: Would you like a...uh... glass of water? Me: *om nom nom* no thanks *nom nom*  By the time my friend was back from the bathroom, the box was empty. Needless to say, after hearing me rave about getting this chocolate cake all weekend long, my friends who waited in the car, were shocked when I came back empty handed.   I can't say I remember exactly how the cake tasted because I wolfed it down so fast, but I do remember the taste of victory, and it was glorious.",

    "text": "Pretty much all you need to do as a white person to determine if an Asian or Asian fusion type restaurant is worthwhile is to simply glance around the room at your fellow restaurant goers. Are they mostly Asian? If so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. If not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.  Don't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow Bachelor Party-Goers and I had here, from the admirable sea bass to the wasabi crusted filet mignon was incredibly well-executed and tasty. But while I still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that I could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the San Gabriel Valley still sunk the experience.  That's just me though. I think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want Asian food in a super-cool environment, Tao could fit the bill. If you want something that's just as special and more reasonably calibrated, price-wise, there are a ton of other places in LV you might want to visit instead.",

    "text": "Ok here we go.... Things to consider on this review: This is a restaurant that claims to be one of the finest Asian Fusion bistro in the US so I should be rated accordingly since they are charging you accordingly. Looks: the place is beautiful, ambiance is perfect, they get a 10 here Service: started good, I was greeted and assigned a table right away, restaurant was near full, once I sat it took 15 min for my waiter just to show and every time I wanted a drink I had to wait much lore than usual just for him to get my order, once ordered the drink came fast, so it was my waiter the cause of the delay. Food: I started with a Crispy tuna roll, it was ok, fresh good flavor but too simple, I've had much better tuna rolls in Fort Worth Then no had the ginger salmon, first I expected wild salmon not farm raised, it was well cooked though it came in pieces, one large a a couple around, not like broken but as if I got the bottom of the pile, again I am rating this restaurant accordingly to what they claim to be.. And charge. Flavor was good, i love ginger, but it was too intense, not even half through i couldn't finish it, it was too much ginger and garlic. Dessert was vanilla ice cream with apples, the apple part was old and hard to chew, the I cream was perfection. Drinks: i ordered a beer, I was surprised they brought me the beer in a aluminum bottle and not even offered a chilled glass, made me feel like a red neck  Would I return ?? NO specially with all the options in Vegas. Hope this is useful !!",

Buddha statue and ancient figures decorate the place. Chinese calligraphy on the roof. Overall, this decoration give me strange feeling. Besides, it's also a night club with disco and dancing at night, I think they doesn't match well.  Lukewarm tea water doesn't meet my standard. Food is ok. I would say that this restaurant is more suitable to non Asian customers. For Asian, with this price, we would expect better food.",

We started off with a couple drinks, all of which were delicious. We then had the duck spring rolls that came with a delicious sauce. The next course we had was a mix of raw fish. I enjoyed this dish as well it was very fresh. For the main course we ordered the chicken sausage fried rice and the Chilean Seabass.  The fried rice was really really good. They even put a fried egg on top and then the server mixed it. I had Chilean Seabass previously and remember it being delicious. It did not disappoint. It was just as good as I remembered it it was totally succulent. I will dream of that sea bass!  Our server was great and the atmosphere was really great. Overall I enjoyed the meal and would try it again!",

The Open Table reservation was easy, and Tao even called ME the day before to confirm, nice!  Our party of three enjoyed the sexy stylings of Tao- in one room you've got a 16-foot Buddha with a wall of white votives, in another you've got a wall of eye popping multicolored squares with objects embedded, they've got an upstairs as well. Everything is just gorgeous.  The short rib appetizer special melted in your mouth, and service was on point all night, explaining the specials and checking in on us frequently. I had their specialty sea bass in a miso reduction over braised vegetables. At first it didn't wow me, but the more I ate it, the better it got! Very good dish.   Everything our table ordered was outstanding, and I would love to come back to try their sushi and specialty rolls. I think my only complaint is that Tao advertises a dress code, but then you do see LV tourists traipsing in with their shorts and sandles. I guess it's inevitable, but wish Tao would keep to the code, as it's a nice place that deserves nicer dress.",

    "text": "Tao Asian Bistro is a trendy, OVERPRICED version of PF Chang's located in the Venetian Hotel. At first glance, Tao's eastern Buddhist inspired atmosphere was inviting, warm, and unique despite the men in black that guarded the entrance. Even on a Tuesday night, the dining room was almost full with late 20s- 30s casual business class patrons. Our host and waiter were efficient though and we were seated right away. So, 4 stars for the ambience and courteous staff!!  Food: We ordered a spicy tuna avocado roll and Singaporean noodle paired with tap water, of course. The spicy tuna avocado roll was good, but nothing spectacular for its $17 price tag. The Singaporean noodle ($26! oh shit! ka-ching!) was dry, cold, and boasted of flavors from the far-east...just kidding, more like flavors from the Costco frozen aisle. Since it was my bff's birthday, they gave us a delicious complimentary dessert, which was the best part of the meal...and i would come back here just for that. The dessert was creatively presented as a giant fortune cookie, decked with a lining of chocolate almonds atop a bed of vanilla and chocolate mouse and surrounded by fresh fruits. The \"fortune cookie\" is really a crunchy crepe, which was not too sweet and just the right price (free!).   We were definitely disappointed with this meal overall, but still had an awesome time because the crowd and waiters were fun! If you want to dress up, but not to the fancy extent of Picasso or Joel Robunchon (umm...completely different price range lol), you might want to check this place out. We might try this place again, but next time opt for their entrees instead.",

I make no apologies for the movie reference - those who get it know who you are LOL!   Ok the food - we started with chicken lollipops (cooked to perfect tenderness yet the skin was crispy and covered in this amazing aromatic Chinese 5 spice sauce), pork bao buns (steamed then pan fried - honestly I could've done without the fry, it was too greasy for me - more steam!), and hot&sour soup (great flavor with all the fix'ns of mushrooms and bamboo shoots, but no egg and the broth was more glutinous than rich broth - too much cornstarch chef!), finally a sushi roll (I don't remember the name, but it wasn't WOW - the sushi roll menu wasn't impressive. If you want raw fish just order from the sashimi section skip the rolls; the fish was still high quality).   Dinner consisted of Signapore Mei Fun noodles (perfect portion for sharing and bursting with flavor), chili chicken (a savory dish of plump bite size chicken breast breaded and sauced up! Not too hot but enough kick!), and grilled ahi tuna (as expected, rare, but I think the grill was too hot or it cooked too long because the edging seemed thicker and dried out instead of thin and flaky; still fresh and good flavors from the sauce n veggies).   Unfortunately, I was too full for dessert, but I look forward to going back because there was more to explore on the menu!",

It's Asian Fusion made American. It's the pimped up fancy cousin of Panda Express.. I was really disappointed with the food since I heard so many good things about them, I'm not saying they taste awful. They were decent for sure but for such a highly rated(and expensive) establishment it's just plain disappointing.   The Tempura was a shocker! The batter they use for the vegetables were inconsistent with the ones used on the Prawn which should be the star of the Tempura. It's just wrong on so many levels..I'm sure if one's never tried real tempura this would have gotten a pass but Com'on guys you have a rep to keep up.  All the Rolls were saucy as you might expect for American Cali rolls, so you'll never find these in Japan for sure.  All in all the Chinese dishes were Sauced heavily or sweet which is absolutely Americanized.   The servers however were excellent and know the menu really well. The decor is a 5 star for sure, and that's the only reason I give Tao a 2 Star and not a 1.  I definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "Despite wanting to come to this place for years now for one reason or another the stars never aligned.  Well, we finally got to eat at the famous Tao restaurant in Vegas. Let me just say I left feeling pretty underwhelmed.  The best compliment I can give this restaurant is it has awesome decor and bumping music. Its rare to eat at an Asian food restaurant where they have Drake playing in the background.  They said plates here are meant to be shared but they were super small portions of food. We tried the pork potstickers and they were almost cute how small they were. Like a large wad of gum. The lobster and shrimp spring rolls were the best thing I tried here all night. Amazing.  As for everything else, we had the duck fried rice and a noodle plate. Those were more than enough to share between the 4 of us. They both lacked in flavor but heavy on salt.  The $50 sirloin and broccoli was not nearly as big as it looks in pictures. One small helping between 4 of us and it was gone. I could have probably finished it all myself. The Orange chicken was delicious but again, not a lot to go around between 4 people.  I guess they are more generous with their rice and noodle plates because they are cheap to make but skimpy on the meat dishes.  Also, be prepared to wait. Had a late 10pm reservation on a Friday night and wasn't seated until 10:45. We were heading to the nightclub upstairs afterward and the promoter requested we get there by midnight or risk losing our table so we felt a little rushed to get through dinner.  I don't regret coming here because I had wanted to try this place out for some time now but it was a bit of a let down",

    "text": "TAO is a well-oiled machine. It was reportedly the highest-grossing independent restaurant in America last year and there're some good reasons for that. Giant space (with a giant buddha sitting in the middle), giant menu, conveniently located inside the Venetian on the Strip, with a nightclub upstairs offering constant celeb sighting. I enjoyed seeing how impressive this is as a business case as much as, if not more than, I enjoyed the food itself.  TAO is the epitome of vibe dining; the entrance is lined with stone tubs filled with water and rose petals, the interior dimly lit with black cobblestones, bamboo, Buddha statues, Sumo wrestler paintings. Front-of-house is extremely efficient - they literally walk super fast; thus don't expect overly warm chatty service, but our waitress managed to take our drink and food orders, check on us, get the check, all in proper times, and our water glasses were never empty. On hearing that we were staying at the Venetian for my birthday trip, she brought out a complementary dessert with bday festivities. It's hard to hit all the service marks in such a giant, fluid venue, but TAO managed to do so.  Enough for my restaurant-working nitpicks, onto the food itself. The sand pot with lobster, shrimp and scallops is a satisfying blend of flavors, although there's too much black bean sauce for my liking. The pad thai is fairly average thus would not recommend spending $$$ on it here. Nigiri and rolls are generally fine but no standouts - which could be a good thing because you should save room for desserts! The giant fortune cookie is amazing; I like how they didn't just make a standard fortune cookie 10 times bigger, but also hid inside white and dark chocolate mousse. The mousse is silky creamy and not overpowering; the white and dark chocolate also provides a nice contrast. My bf usually prefers milk chocolate while I prefer dark and we both found a happy middle ground. I'd come back for this dessert alone. I do really think their New York location should have this dish though; wouldn't \"black & white cookie\" be a nicer pun in NYC?",

We started with a sushi roll which was super fresh and dumplings which were also great. The best part of the meal though was the entree. We each got the Shabu Shabu. The beef was beautifully marbled and tender and the broth was salty but delicate. It was so fun to be able to cook the beef itself and was absolutely delicious. Such a memorable meal",

In fact, all 4 of us got it for our entree.  Let me first start off by talking about the service- AMAZING.  They were very attentive, helpful, and friendly.  Now onto the food.  We started off with the crispy tuna, the lobster dumplings, and the hot and sour soup for his sister's boyfriend.  He didn't like the soup and let the server know, and decided to order another one of the crispy tunas.  The servers did not give us a hard time, but took it back and came out with another crispy tuna quickly.   Now that miso glazed sea bass- SOOOOO good.  I could have probably eaten it with a spoon.  It could probably be one of the best sea bass entrees I've ever had. I would say for the price, it was actually not tooooo unreasonable ($39).  We ended with dessert, we shared the lava cake and a huge lime shaved ice.  The dessert was pretty good, but I'd definitely come back for the sea bass.",

The atmosphere is what really sells this place in my opinion. If you are looking for a romantic date night spot look no further. The dimmed lighting and red interiors make this place feel super lux.   I called that same day to see if I could make reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night and they were completely booked. However we were able to snag a seat at the sushi bar around that time.   I hope went with the chicken gyoza and the Buddha's harmonized vegetable feast. I really would have preferred soup dumplings as I am not a big potsticker fan. They were good, but didn't blow me away. Now the Buddha's harmonized vegetables were my favorite. You get a pretty nice sized bowl of vegetables and udon noodles tossed in soy sauce. Personally, I think this is the place you go for the atmosphere more so than the food.",

The hostess showed us to our seat & asked how are time in Vegas was. Since the nightclub was closed, she recommended ones that were open.   Our server immediately brought us waters & gave us time to order. Now, onto the food  Drunken lobster pad thai: A full lobster displayed in a bowl with flavorful seasonings & topped with bean sprouts. There is actual lobster & (small) nuts mixed in with the pad thai.  Saba (mackerel): the mackerel was freshly sliced on a bed of glowing ice & decorated with a plumeria flower. It was gorgeously displayed & literally glowing.   Spring mountain roll: this sushi roll had Spicy King Crab &  Lobster & was topped with spicy tuna and avocado. The avocado was fresh which I appreciated & the flavors blended well together with the first bite  The atmosphere is extremely warm & even dark in some places so if you're looking for brighter lighting, you may want to try somewhere else. The warm lighting creates an intimate atmosphere to me it seemed. You will definitely notice the big Buddha that is several feet tall & the centerpiece of the whole restaurant.   The food is delicious & the atmosphere is more intimate, two things I appreciate in a restaurant!",

The atmosphere here is great and really positioned well for the night club business.    We were told the wait for a large table would be about 20 minutes - no big deal.  We found a place to sit and got a round of drinks.   I had an old fashioned which was good, but not great.   I would have expected a large ice block not small cubes.     In less than 20 minutes, our table was ready and off we went.  Since we had a group of us, we ordered food \"family style\".   So we shared a few appetizers and then shared main dishes.   Overall, the food was good.   Portion sizes were good as well.  Lots of choices and variety of dishes.   Our waiter was great with his recommendations.     If you get there late enough for dinner but before the club opens, they will stamp your hand so that you can get into the club.   At least that is what they did for us!  Now don't come to Tao for the prices.  Prices aren't cheap but they are reasonable for the atmosphere and location.",

The waiter was so nice, he walked us through the menu page by page and was able to answer every and all questions we had. The food was so fresh, and came out in perfect timing. As a table we decided to do family style of food and ordered a variety of things. Everything from the lobster pad tai to the sushi was so good, we even went in for desert. It was pricey, but that was totally expected. I would def recommend this place to just about anyone 21+, date night, work related, girls night out, etc...

I had been wanting to try Tao for years so when I came to Vegas this trip, it was on my list of places I wanted to try. I really enjoyed the ambiance and dim lighting but when it came to the food I wasn't impressed. I got the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, which was good, but nothing special. I ordered a salmon roll with avacado...the waitress said something about that not being on the menu, although I was looking right at were it said salmon sushi, and you could make it a roll (+$6). She charged me $23 for the roll and it had very little salmon in it (never have I had such little sushi in a sushi roll...and with sushi being one of my favorite foods, I have had sushi often from various restaurants) I asked the waitress about it and she said that's what she had to charge me and there's nothing she could do about it. I also ordered the pad Thai, which I did not enjoy. For me the sauce was too sweet, and lacking the flavor I was looking for. Overall I left quite disappointed on multiple things. With Thai food and sushi being some of my favorite foods, I was really looking forward to dining with Tao, but given this last experience, I don't think it's somewhere I would want to dine at again :(",

    "text": "A group of my friends and I went to Tao last night to celebrate a birthday dinner for eight.  The service was absolutely horrible. I made a reservation several weeks ago for 8 pm and they made us wait for 45 minutes.  Once we got seated, it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order then we waited another 20 mintues between appetizer and the main courses.  When my friend complained, the waitress responded by saying, \"I was trying to time it right,\" then proceeded to bring out the rest of the remaining dishes (all six of them) in one shot!    Gratuity for a large group is automatically  added at 20%, so I got the impression that  they take no pride in taking care of their guests once you're seated.  My rankings are the following:  Service: one star Food: two 1/2 stars  The Chilean Sea Bass and the New York Strip steak were decent.  The potstickers were average.  The noodles and the XO string beans were over seasoned and soggy.  You can get better Chinese food elsewhere for 1/4 the price. We paid $57 per person.  Bottom line is you pay for the ambiance mostly at Tao, but the food is mediocre at best.  A dinner that should have taken 1 hour and 1/2, took 3 hours due to poor service and lack of attention.  I would think a restaurant of their caliber would take more pride in treating their guests right.",

My husband and I started with a few appetizers- he had the hot & sour soup with shrimp toast.  The shrimp toast was the best I've ever tasted.  I had the shrimp tempura which was made with large, meaty prawns.  We split the pork dumplings, which we both praised. We shared the orange chicken as an entree.  We also ordered a side of rice, which was perfect because the entree also came with rice.  The chicken was excellent and served with that green Chinese vegetable I like and always forget to look for at the grocery store.  We both agreed that the dish was sweet- it would be perfect with another spicy dish to balance it. Loved the 20 foot Buddha and the opium pipe wall.  Hated the meditating Buddha heads on the wall behind the host desk- it looked like body parts.  We also didn't quite get the large bathtub type objects filled with rose petals in the entrance.  I am guessing it's a nod to offerings to Buddha. If you are thinking about trying this place, go.  There is a reason it's the highest grossing restaurant in the country.

We tried to talk to someone to tell them we were there and they told us we had to wait in line to check in. When we finally made it to check in, they informed us that they had given our table away because we were more than 15 mintues late. They then gave us a buzzer and told us we'd be seated shortly. One hour later we finally were seated.   The hostesses were accepting $100 \"tips\" to seat parties more quickly, however if you didn't want to pay them to seat you -- you had to wait an hour.   The food was delicious and looked amazing... Pricing was on paar with other Vegas restaurants. -- Ambiance was okay, but the the music from the club bleed into the restaurant after 10pm and made it almost impossible to have a normal conversation. The food poisoning we got from the food ruined our entire groups evening as well as most of the next day.",

    "text": "We decided to go to dinner here after seeing a show.  It was very crowded since it is probably the #1 nightclub in Vegas and the line to get into the club was wrapped around the atrium.  We showed up for our 10:15p reservation and was told they were running a little late so 10:15 turned into about 1045p or later.  We decided to sit at the bar and order some sushi and a drink.  Both the sushi and the mango martini were very good.  We then sat at a table and ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken.  Both dishes were really good and the portions were very generous.  Service was good as well.  While you are waiting for your table it is very entertaining and I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are in the mood for asian food.",

    "text": "My friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a \"scene,\" that simultaneously had good food.  Needless to say, Tao was not the right spot for us.  As for the \"scene,\" Tao pretty much hits the mark.  It is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of Las Vegas visitors looking for a good time.  As for the food, it was very mediocre.  I will not be returning.  On a busy Saturday night in Las Vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  Not bad, huh?  Well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, I was expecting to be seated right away.  I want my 40 bucks back! Oh well, live and learn.  On to the food.  Between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellowtail crunchy onion roll, lobster wontons, shishito peppers, vegetable brown fried rice, and edamame.  Sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  This was definitely enough food for us though.  The sushi was really not impressive.  Yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  Well, we got three.  The worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  So small! So bland! So boring! Come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  The other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  This is my pet peeve.  Leave off the heavy sauce people! Especially if it tastes like crap.  The lobster wontons were pretty decent, I could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  I will say the vegetable brown fried rice was pretty good.  This \"healthier\" version of fried rice was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  The best thing at this restaurant by far was the shishito peppers! I swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  I cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, Tao did a good job here.  If you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  I wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  Anyway, I may come back to Tao for a drink, but as for food, I will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.",

I would have loved to given this place 5 starts But, as soon as we folded our menus and gave them to the waiter someone else seemed to have come with our food. It brought the question of 'heat lamp' to mind. The food was amazing so I can't say anything about that. It is a lot of money, which is ok, because that fact isn't hidden up front, but being rushed for a quick turn around isn't good either. I would highly recommend Tao to anyone visiting Vegas, make it clear you intend to stay awhile and really enjoy the great job they did decorating and take in the ambiance. I give the food and service 5 stars!!",

    "text": "I have been to Tao before, though usually earlier in the evening and we liked it enough to go back. Well, that is the last time I will be going there and also the last time I will recommend that anyone else go either.   Like many of the other reviewers I had made a dinner reservation (far in advance) for a Sat night dinner. The best time we could get was 10:15. After waiting in line for the \"reservation check-in\" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. Well wait we did. We didn't get seated until and hour later! What kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? That is really poor front of the house operation.   FOOD: The Shabu-Shabu Filet was terrible. It tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. The green beans we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and I could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the spring rolls (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! Not one person at our table commented on liking their food.   The wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. After that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. When it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. Even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! If you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.  After our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club upstairs. They came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. When the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry for two to get in ($50!!). Immediately we said, \"wait we don't have to pay\" Instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. He acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. What, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? Geee, thanks so much for the generosity. To top it all off, the club sucks. Cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. We decided to go up the Tao Beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.  With all of the choices in Vegas now, this place needs to step up their service and food quality or be replaced.",

The Miso Glazed Salmon was awesome. The Steaks were melt in your mouth great! It is pricey but, it is so worth the money. Also considering your in Vegas where even a 20oz Coke is $5. The service we received from Jeffrey was second to none. VERY professional. We will go back next time in Vegas.",

I went with a very large group and they sat us in a separate space from the rest of the dining area. That allowed the wait staff to focus on our party - and they were great (in the past I've found the wait staff to be very rushed). We had a set menu with a good mix of food. Highlight for me was the cod. Sushi was OK too (just). When we left I was amazed to see the lines of people trying to get into the nightclub (very different than the crowd at dinner). Overall a great place to go especially if you're already staying at or near the Venetian. Was surprisingly better than I expected.",

I would reccomend coming to Tao if you have a set reservation or know someone, otherwise you are going to be waiting in line for a long ass time. The place is like a maze and when you are drunk, figuring your way in and out is something else. During the club part, they have naked girls in the bathtubs which is pretty incredible. I couldn't stop staring. A great place to come if you are looking to throw down serious money for guareenteed good time. If you don't get bottle service, plan on trying to work your way into VIP or be sadly disappointed by the crowds surround the bar!!",

The lounge is a nice area to people watch as you wait for your table or if you have no reservation, you can eat there on a first come-first serve basis. We always get a plate of sushi for starters. The spicy tuna roll is good. Had the wasabi crusted filet w/ onion rings, decent. The wasabi was a different twist on things, but I think I can do without. Also previously had the miso sea bass with peking duck fried rice as a side, both were decent as well. Service has always been pretty good.  I would reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance or you'll be dining late. I mean starting dinner at 11:30pm late.  I've learned when you go to a trendy Asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. Sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. If you're looking at Tao then you heard about the nice decor. The vibe is Vegas/Hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. If you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club. You can impress your friends and said you had dinner at the highest grossing restaurant in the country, which Tao is. The place is more about the scene than the food. But worth checking out once to see what the fuss is all about.",

But is comparable to good inexpensive chinese restuarants.  But if you like eating it in a nice ambiance you gotta go the Tao.  The reason I am giving this 4 stars is because our waiter was the BOMB diggity.  He is a skinny black guy with glasses.  And he was BY  FAR the BEST waiter ever.  He knew the menu from top to bottom and had something to say about everything.  He made the meal pleasant. He was on top of things, didn't miss a beat and helped us with anything.  Suggestions for places to go and places to see.  NEVER had a waiter that good before.  My husband felt the same way.  He even gave the guy a compliment, said \" you are a really good waiter.\"  And my hubby never compliments anyone.. haha I know.  If I go to the TAO again, i will ask for him., should have caught his name to give him credit.    But even though I went to the bar beforehand (at the Tao), which was alright, cause the girls are pretty but had attitude.  Why do some hot girls need to be \"bitchy?\"  don't understand it, but it was all good,,, afterall.",

Atmosphere is sexy dark and non invasive. We sat in the mezanine overlooking Buddha. I ordered Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai and my husband ordered the Black Pepper Sizzled Filet with Udon Noodles. We shared both as they each sent your mouth into absolute happiness. After dinner I had the Orient Express Martini for dessert (so delicious) and then we sat and enjoyed a pot of tea before paying the check. Perfect 10 year Anniversary dinner.  They also stamped us for the Nightclub which was awesome as the line was at least a mile long. Will return for sure!",

    "text": "Wow....This place is WAYYYYY overrated! This is coming from a Chinese San Franciscan who has had her fair share of real Chinese food and the attempted crappy Asian fusion foods.  So a few friends and I made reservations two days in advance and this is how it works; if reservations are made they call us the day of to make sure we are still coming. I thought, okay they wanna make sure so when we come by they have a table ready for us....how spiffy. Was I wrong! We all got there 5 minutes before our expected arrival hoping to get some food and then head to the club upstairs. To my surprised, we get a pager and we are told to wait until a table is ready in ten to fifteen minutes. WTF?!! We confirmed earlier that we will be there and we come early and we STILL had to wait?!?!? Mind you that we have not eaten and we are all starving so, we were pretty frustrated....and after fifteen minutes....no pager action so we head to the front and ask when we will be seated. The host looked flustered and told someone to lead us to the table. Wow such \"wonderful\" service and it doesn't end there.  When we finally got seated (also I was looking around when we were taken to our seats....there were plenty of open tables), I looked through the menu and decided what to order in like 5 minutes. I kept a timer near by me because I saw how much the waiter was passing us and it took them 20 minutes from handing out our menus to actually take our orders down.   When we finally got our food, the only good thing about it was probably the plate it was on. I ordered the Thai roasted chicken. When I ate my first piece of it, I realized that the chicken was dry....not the way I like my chicken to be cooked. In addition, The chicken was coated with a ton of very sweet sauce. I tried using the sauce to moisten the chicken up but the sauce did not complement the chicken. I was very disappointed with that. I even a bite from my boyfriends food...Meh it was alright.  My overall review for this place, we came in at 9 and didn't leave until 11 due to waiting for service to come by. I think we spent probably a good 75% of the time just waiting. So what do i say about the service, that IT SUCKS! The food was not worth the taste or the price. I wasn't very pleased with the place and will not be returning to the restaurant to eat ever again.",

We were a group of 7 so we were offered the option to do a \"family style\" meal. It can range between $50-$250 per person. We went with $50 and they did not disappoint. They selected and brought several appetizer plates and several entrees. We even had one vegetarian in the group and they made all the accommodations for him and ensured he had plenty to eat. Our server was very nice and attentive. Absolutely EVERYTHING we had was good- even the vegetarian options. Some of my favorites were the Filet mignon, dumplings, tuna on rice cake, fried rice with chinese sausage and the spicy tuna sushi. Definitely recommend if you are open to trying just about anything and having a good time.",

We came in on a saturday night at 8:30, it was pretty busy yet our server never neglected us. i stopped eating sushi THREE years ago, but their sushi looked soooo good i could not resist!! their sushi is SO BOMB! great service and staff! :)  sidenotes:  -it's attached to a nightclub, but the nightclub is separate. you will walk thru the shops first before you get to the restaurant.  -it is pretty noisy in there, (not in a bad way because i loved the music lol). -I did see a party with a child, but I would suggest it's predominantly not kid friendly because of the nightclub being attached, the dimness, and the noise levels. but it is doable!  -also, it's nice that it's in the venetian, because the venetian has free parking!",

We were blatantly disrespected & ignored the entire time.   After being seated our waiter Kameron came and took one persons drink order and  abruptly disappeared for about 30 min. After finally recovering one drink at an 11 person table, he took our food order and disappeared once again, but this time for over an hour. He did not check in on us ONE SINGLE time.   We decided that our business wasn't wanted and got up to leave when the manager begged us to stay and offered us a round a shots that NEVER came.  When the food finally came out, it was disgusting and dry, as if it had been sitting.   After all of that we still paid full price and no accommodations were made.   THE SERVICE,FOOD,and MANAGEMENT failed miserably & it completely ruined my birthday dinner. I made a horrible mistake choosing TAO.   PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME!!   I give it one star because 0 stars is not an option !!!",

Had an amazing assortment for a big birthday dinner and they do a great job of accommodating large groups (we were about 20). The yellowtail sashimi with ponzu and jalapeno was delicious and super fresh. The lo mein is perfectly cooked with the right ratio of ingredients, and their miso sea bass appetizer is unreal. We also had orders of waygu steak with crispy onions (medium rare) orange chicken (a bit spicy, which I loved) and their massive fortune cookie birthday dessert with chocolate and fruit was unreal.   Overall a really good time, expect to be there for a long time to drink, eat (order more appetizers than main dishes, they're amazing) good music and amazing environment.",

    "text": "After a hellacious road trip here, I decided to spoil myself for dinner. Ordered the sand pot lobster, shrimp, and scallop for 42$. Not impress. Mainly because I was expecting it to come out on sand. The name is a bit of a deceptive creative concept for alluring the diner to a more upscale price point. What came out was a clay pot. Something I can get in Chinatown for a fraction of the charge. Ordering rice? Upcharge. You mean steam rice does not come with my food? I am not a tight spender by any means, but 5$ for a bowl of steam rice that customary accompanies an Asian dish?   Since I was myself, I had to take a seat at the bar. That means if you, like myself, wanted the Wagyu or Filet Mignon Shabu Shabu...it will be an impossiblity. Understandable.   Ordered a sake flight and it was probably the best thing there.   Outside of the ambiance, I'm not sure what the appeal is to dine here. I mean, unless you like your dining environment so loud, you can hardly hear yourself think...feel free. Probably going to come back and experience the night club scene. Oh, as one of the other Yelper suggests, I felt rushed to finish my food at the bar so they can seat more people.",

After poor service and feeling \"out of place\", our waitress \"accidentally\" charged our table three times our original bill... This is where the general manager (Matthew Griffith) became involved.   We were expecting an apology on behalf of the restaurant for charging  my card $150 more than the actual bill. Instead, when addressed the manager seemed uninterested, dismissive and very plainly apologized and said it would be sorted out.   He didn't ask for our names, nor a phone number to contact and I personally didn't believe a word he was saying.  Needles to say, Tao did not live up to our expectations and as a server myself VERY disappointed with how the entire situation was handled.",

The vibe was nice, the food was delicious, and the service was great. Our reservation was at 6pm but we were running late and they let us reschedule to 6:45pm instead. We then got seated at the lounge as we waited for the rest of our group. Once the rest of our group came, they seated us right away. The servers refilled our drinks promptly and always checked up on us to see if we needed anything. My bf got the miso glazed sea bass and he fell in love with it!! We definitely recommend it! My friends got the sand pot lobster, shrimp, & clams, pad Thai, fried rice, and a bunch more plates that I can't remember and they all liked their meal. The portions vary. My friend's pad Thai was huge and my other friend's plates that was probably lo mein (?) was smaller. Another friend's plate was a small bowl of fried rice. Since we were celebrating my birthday, they gave us a free fortune cookie dessert that was so so good!! It came with fortunes for everyone at the table and the fortunes were a mix of \"serious\" and silly. It definitely gave us all a laugh and was probably the best part!",

PFC is not really Chinese either, it's Amero-chinese and they do a good job of it. TAO is totally mall Chinese. I can be OK with mall Chinese. Two meats, a veg and some noodles for $10? Great! One meat for $25? Not so much. To make matters worse, it's generally pretty bland for the sugared-up type of Chinese food that this tries to be.  If you're into the Buddha Bar looks of the early 2000's, this is great. Otherwise, go elsewhere if you care about food.",

Here's what we always get: - Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice - Lobster Won Tons - Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass (with wok vegetables) - Grilled 12 oz Kobe Ribeye (with Yuzu Cilantro Butter) - Wasabi Crusted Filet (with tempura of onion rings) - Giant Fortune Cookie (with white & dark chocolate mousse)  This is the best sea bass I have ever had. We have come back to Tao time and time again because we love this dish so much. The fish melts in your mouth and falls apart beautifully. The Kobe Ribeye is amazing-- tender, perfectly cooked, seasoned exceptionally. I am very picky about how my steaks are cooked and they cooked this wonderfully-- rare and delicious.   (If you don't want to pay $85 for the Kobe steak, the wasabi crusted filet is a wonderful option. They do a great job seasoning and cooking it.)  The restaurant has a dark, sexy vibe that we really enjoy. It's classy, upscale, and intimate. The whole atmosphere is impressive to say the least-- words really don't do it justice. The entrance to the restaurant has giant baths filled with rose petals, there's a 2 story tall Buddha... It's over the top and makes it a really memorable spot for dinner. MAKE A RESERVATION.",

    "text": "Went out for a fancy dinner with friends to celebrate some birthdays this past weekend in Vegas. Dressed to the nines and prepared for some fancy offerings...was NOT disappointed!  Atmosphere: Dark and intimate! Two levels of fancy decor and a giant Buddha in the middle of the first floor. Make sure you have reservations to this place. It's very popular. It is a great place to go for date night if you want somewhere romantic. Or bring a group for a fancy night out with friends!  Drinks: Don't expect a cheap drink here! I had a small bottle of sake for $30 and most cocktails were very pricey. Wine is pricey as well and beer is available for a cost.   Food: INDULGE. Just do it. I had the Duck Fried Rice which was sooo flavorful and was a giant bowl full. So many herbs and not as greasy as I had expected. Thanks to my fellow Vegas goers I got to taste the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice, Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups, Chicken Gyoza, Drunken Lobster Pad Thai as well as the Grilled Kobe Ribeye. Everything was amazing and that steak was like butter! Leftovers were a must. If you can, pass around the Giant Fortune Cookie dessert (free with Yelp check in!!!!). This place is great",

The bar tender was good at her job - told me their signature dish was sea bass on a skewer.  It was terrible - chewy and salty.  I think it gave me a bad stomach.  The lobster wonton was my favorite though all the dishes were too salty - not a symbol of very pricey restaurants of which this is.  I also had the spicy tuna carparcio something-or-other. It was so over seasoned and salty that you could not tell what you were eating.  I ordered some vegetable medley that came with Udon noodles which wasn't bad - could be less sweet.  Overall, I expected a lot more for a high-priced restaurant like this.",

    "text": "Tao is your typical asian fusion restaurant that caters towards the American tastebud. It's like a fancy PF Chang's with Japanese food, chinese food, Thai food, korean food, a little bit of everything. To start off, the service was amazing from start to finish. Our waiter gave us his recommendations for the food and checked up on us throughout our dinner enough for us to have everything we needed but not so much where we felt uncomfortable. Our water cups were constantly filled, if we had taken a sip they would come and fill it back up to the top. Everyone had a friendly smile on their face and seemed genuinely interested in making our dining experience great and it was! ... at least in the service aspect. Now for the food, we ordered the sizzling fried size with roast pork, chinese 5 spices ribs, crispy pork bao buns, and a chicken pad Thai. The crispy pork and chinese 5 spices ribs were probably the best dishes of the four but they weren't great either. The sizzling fried rice was kind of dry and the pork looked like something I would find in a $3 breakfast burrito back in the middle school days. And the pad Thai, I couldn't even eat it. We took it for take out and I tried to eat it again as a drunchie and it still tasted horrible and it says a lot if food tastes bad when you're drunk. If it weren't for the service and the ambience of the restaurant I probably would have given 3 stars but I probably would return again to try the sushi (which seemed popular) and other dishes. And mostly for the service and ambience.",

I had phoned in my reservation but when I got there, they didn't have my reservation!  Go figure!  Anyway, we got seated promptly.  We ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken, Fried Rice with Kimchee, Red Fried Rice with Pork Belly, Endamame, Lo Mein, & Long Beans.    It was just OK.  Not fantastic.  It's bordering on westernized Chinese food.  The presentation of some of the dishes made me wonder why they selected their china that way.  The bowls were huge and on a pedestal and not your usual rice bowl.  Very difficult to eat noodles or rice.  They try to impress that they are using Chinese china in an interesting, splashy way but it doesn't make sense.  Why use a clay pot for long beans when there's hardly any beans in the dish?  You have to really look into the pot to grab the long beans!    Decor is very nice.  Big Buddha as the centrepiece.  Dark with very low lighting and candles.  I had to get used to it.  There's a wall of pipes, in their own coloured showcases.  Interesting.",

This was supposed to be an Asian fusion type restaurant but it really lacked in Asian authenticity in terms of flavor. It seemed like the chefs just used different types of sauces  to compensate for lack of flavor which resulted in chaos.   Fried rice with sausage: Very SMALL portion. Weird \"sweet and sour\" sauce spread over the rice. I would not order again.   Pad Thai: Lacking flavor. Some type of sweet taste that I knew after one bite, I would get sick of it after subsequent bites. Very unauthentic. I would not order this again either.",

If you've never had a Tao-tini, I highly suggest you do so ASAP.    We ordered multiple items off the menu for our dinner, including the Chilean Sea Bass Satay as an appetizer.  After watching the Vegas edition of \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" on Food Network, we wanted to try this highly touted app.  I am so happy we did!  That was seriously one of the best foods I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Everything else was just as yummy.  Tuna Tar Tar, Pad Thai, Halibut, etc. etc.  We all loved the food.

Having dinner at Tao gets you easy entry into the club, which was perfect for us since we needed to eat and hate lining up. We showed up for our 9:15 reservation and instead of being seated were handed a buzzer to let us know when the table was ready. I realized this meant there would be a wait so we sat at the bar and ordered two Kirins (the bartender looked slightly disappointed that we didn't want cocktails but it's 2016 and I don't do lychee martinis anymore). The wait wasn't exactly short but not long enough for us to finish our beers. When we were finally seated, our attentive server Mike told us the specials and we were immediately sold on the pastrami fried rice. We also ordered lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth and Chinese five spice short ribs. I honestly didn't have very high expectations but it was all pretty tasty and we were quite satisfied. We ended our dinner with key lime doughnuts, another yummy special. After we settled our check, we asked Mike about access to the club and a lady and black soon came over to stamp us wrists for entry. We then just had to go back out to the entrance to have our IDs checked, then we circled right back into the club - no lines, no muss, no fuss. I've had far more difficult entries to Tao before so I thought this was a really great deal. The club experience itself was not super stellar - the DJ seemed to have a playlist from 5 years ago - so we left after just one round of drinks. But it was well worth having a good dinner and a brief club interlude just to round out our Vegas experienc",

Josh if you are reading this, THANK YOU for making our experience one of the best experiences we had in our trip to Vegas.",

We were greated warmly, and arriving at 5:30 on a Friday evening we were seated promptly. Our waiter took great care in making sure we understood the menu. My wife ordered the tempura eggplant and the mandarin fried rice with pork and I ordered the chilean sea bass. Both of our entrees arrived warm and presented well. I sampled my wife's fried rice and I can honestly say it was the best I have had. And the chilean sea bass was just as I remembered it...out of this world! We topped it off with the giant fortune cookie...holy smokes was it good! For the two of us it was under $100 and well worth it!",

I ordered two kinds of sushi - angry dragon roll and whatever the waiter recommended - and i loved my angry dragon roll. The waiter forced me to get the other roll or he wouldn't give me the stamp to get into the club portion of TAO. (Going to Vegas with all guys, never again!) That's fine by me, except the waiter said it in a mean spirited way and was pretty rude overall in my opinion. However the food was TAO's saving grace. I also had the prime rib and orange chicken which was super yummy.  My friend ordered the kobe steak, which was amazing! It was so good, it deserves its very own paragraph! Perfectly cooked and just made me fall in love with steak all over again. My friend was kind enough to share that delicious steak with the rest of our party. One phrase stands out to me from that night, \"the kobe steak was like an orgasm in my mouth.\"  I think the steak definitely bumped my rating from 3 stars to 4. Again, it was really awesome.",

    "text": "We stayed at The Palazzo on our last visit to Vegas and were looking for a nearby restaurant for dinner. It was Friday night and we had to meet friends back in our rooms at 9:30pm, so I made an early reservation at 7:30pm. We arrived at 7:30 to be told \"your table is almost ready, please have a seat in the lounge\". I ordered the Tao-tini, which was way too sweet. Not bad, just tasted like Kool-aid and not what I expected. In 15 minutes we were called for our table and then promptly forgotten about as we stood awkwardly adjacent to the host stand and three other tables were seated ahead of us. Another 10 minutes before we are shown to our table. It's now nearly 8pm so we quickly place another drink order and review the menu. (Great atmosphere and cool vibe coming from the restaurant, BTW.) So by at 8:15pm we flag down a waiter (not ours, he disappeared) to order. We promptly got our appetizer and then we waited. And waited more. We ordered sushi and Shabu Shabu. Items that you DO NOT NEED TO COOK. So please tell me why our food took 45 minutes to arrive? At this point it was 9pm and our remaining friends had arrived early to the hotel so one gal barely ate and left to go meet them with the room key while the remaining group ate in the most un-lady like fashion and scarfed our plates of food. Ridiculous. The manager came over at that point to offer us another round of drinks and dessert on the house!?!???? We were already late, and no we don't want to be delayed even further. He ended up comping our app and drinks instead.   All in all the food was good, the drinks were mediocre and the service was terrible. I wanted to love Tao Las Vegas (I love the New York location) but I can't get over the horrible service. No one in our group will be back.",

We were already pretty tipsy so we didn't have anymore drinks, we were just there for the music and, quite frankly, since we stayed at the Venetian it was the most convenient, and open place for us to go. I guess that it kind of won by default but we still liked it.   They have cool buddist projections on the dimly lit walls, and the hallway to the restroom is lined in buddist monk art. They should have named this place Buddist because of all the bodacious Buddist decor at every corner.  Anyway, the only negative is that we tried to explore the upper level, but got denied because we didn't have a stamp on our hand. Not sure what that stamp was, or where to get it, but it was probably a buddah head. Oh well, we enjoyed ourselves anyway. But be forewarned that if you head in at the wee hours of the night, there are drunks o plenty who are full of brave juice and you'll have to either laugh em off or swat them away like flies! Either way it makes for some hilarious times!",

After that though, he got pretty pushy, with all his recommendations corresponding directly to the most expensive items on the menu.  I get that you make money off of tips, and that you're getting an automatic 20% off our large party, but really?  If you give me a good service, I'll tip above and beyond the 20% you talk on automatically.  Guy was a bit clueless too, when someone mentioned we were Korean, he was wondering if there was anything Korean inspired on the menu . . . either the staff isn't trained well, or he's just bad.  The food is Asian fusion, with strong Chinese influences, and a bit of Japanese and Thai thrown in.  Anyway, the food was okay - the prawns were over-cooked, but the beef was good, and the eggplant was delicious.  Edamame was good, but that's hard to screw up.  On the other hand, the prices were exorbitant for the quality and small portion sizes.  With as many options as there are in Vegas, I don't see myself returning on any future trips . . .",

I suppose with the economy, Vegas is hurting too so he's gotta \"make it work\".  Other than that, here's the rundown:  -Sushi:  We shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  We had a spicy, crunchy tuna roll and something else with yellowtail; like I said, good, but I've had better at Sushi Wabi in Chicago.    -Drinks:  Sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  Left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  The other tini's were on the sweet side.    -Dinner:  We had peking duck for two...MUST try.  It was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  Friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and chilean sea bass, also delicious.  I thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for Vegas.    -Atmosphere:  Lots of typical d-bags yelling \"Vegas Baby!!\" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  But overall, no complaints.  We were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank.",

Expect to spend some time waiting for your table, surrounded by giant bachelor and bachelorette parties, convention groups, etc. I'd say it's a great place to see and be seen, but not really...it's more of a place to gawk at the bad choices people made before leaving their hotel rooms. \"Oh no, she did NOT just wear that sweater as a dress. Oh no, this guy does NOT have a moustache minus the irony...\" You get the idea.  Still, it's certainly over the top and will wow newbies to Vegas. And if you are as much about getting your drink on as getting your eat on, this is the perfect choice. However, if you are focused on the finery of your food, you will probably be disappointed by the excessive use of salt in everything that drowns out flavors and creates one TAO taste.  Bottom line: know what you are getting into. If you do, you may love it!",

Upon arrival, the decor was very nice and I thought I was in for a treat.  Well I was wrong.    We started with a few cocktails, which were good.  We ordered some starters, The Edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), Hot and Sour Soup with Shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and Vegetable Dumplings (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).    For entrees we ordered the Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken (which was basically like Sweet and Sour Chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), Eggplant, and Noodles.  After seeing the food I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  The food is not flavorful in any way and I definently think that Tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were unimpressive)  At the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  I have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  They had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the GIGANTIC fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  They also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert eggroll.    Overall I would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Other reviews are pretty accurate.   We had a 9pm reservation and were seated at around 9:45.   Service was very slow and we were there for about 3 hours (mind you this was Asian fusion and not a 7-course french tasting menu).   Our waiter left out parts of our order (the sides), but this was rectified in a fairly timely manner.   Appetizers and sushi were the highlights of the meal.   We went to the nightclub after dinner (you can ask for a stamp during dinner that will then waive your cover,  but they do make you go downstairs and wait in a line in order to get in to the club ... you can't just enter from the dining  area, although this would be physically possible ).   Food and service are average, likely busy due to the hype and that it is currently trendy.   Not sure how this place will do long term.    It was fine, but it is unlikely that I would return on future trips to Vegas.",

I have to admit I came in quite hungry so if I would have known I was only going to get four pieces, I would have ordered more. The environment is very dim and relaxing and the service was great. The menu is pricey, but totally worth it. My bf ordered a saki martini that tasted wooonderful. I can't wait to go back and next time get to visit the Tao Nightclub next time (it was closed when we visited.)",

    "text": "*bias switch on*  Unaccustomed as I am to the wayward excess of wesson cooking oil, cryogenically frozen hamburgers -their flesh revived after 5 years of roaming the Mc pastures- and a forced-entry of Harsh Browns-shirts down my esophagus, for the everyday equivalent of a Nazi Spandau prison breakfast, my antibodies capitulated and allowed the stomachal aches to begin their bombing. I decided to tenderly call it \"the blitz\"  This necessary intro will frame for you the picture of my everyday routine in Vegas; as I made my way for the Sands expo center at the Venetian, and with the imperative need to eat some breakfast and lunch. It was not until Friday, after a party at said hotel's poolside, that I finally had the opportunity to sit down at a real restaurant, where I would have at least, real food (the rest of the evenings, btw, dinner was served in a bottle with lime) Enter Tao:  Oh yes. Finally some tranquility, some posh, some xanax imbued zest! My muscles relaxed the moment I sat at the couch. My pancreas wept alongside my saliva centers as soon as I blinked through the menu options. I refuse to pejoratively call \"drooling\" what clearly was the act of tender weeping. The why? Crispy Spicy Tuna and the lusciously fresh Salmon in a sweet (but spicy) sesame sauce and incrusted with crispy onions. Naturally, I enjoyed every bite of these dishes with unabashed contempt to all cuisines under the tyranny of wesson oil, and with unabashed praise towards the butcher's dexterity of the sushi liberating chefs. Kudos.  As I made my way towards the bathroom, I noticed that Tao offers an expansive seating area to accommodate many refugees like myself, and when I also saw the stairs that led to the TAO nightclub chamber, I couldn't help but feel how the imposing pictures of the monks and innocent children that loomed in the walls in front of me, where in fact, severely bent on scattering my sinful wishes aroused, or perhaps to manipulate them by whispering in a nomadic tongue: \"Its all-ight, we approve!\" And so that you know that monks never lie, Tao offers to stamp a comp admission to the TAO nightclub above in your pumping wrist, only and if you have dined in the zen establishment. Watch the horror and astonishment of the serpent-like queue as you breeze by them and re-enter for the club scott-free (yes, they make you exit, and re-enter through the VIP line in order for you to undergo a quick ID inspection. Sorry toddlers!)  So I have no problem bowing to the wisdom of the Tao Te King, and acknowledging that \"Tao\" is indeed \"the way\". Do come to this amicable speck in the midst of the chaotic Vegas strip Taiji to replenish your Yin, and by all means, your Yang waiting for you upstairs.",

    "text": "I wish there was a way to give it a negative number of stars.  I have been to the Tao NY location and loved their giant fortune cookie dessert!  I can't tell you that the food itself or drinks were memorable but I did want to check out the Vegas location so I made a reservation.  Boy, did I make a mistake. My friends and I arrive right on time and are told that even w/ reservations, everyone waits 30 mins.  So we asked them how long we would have waited if we didn't have reservations.  Apparentlly, they didn't have our reservations although I had made the reservations w/ them directly that day.  Strike one from the host who was the rudest man on earth.  He must have taken too many \"cool pills\" since he had something up his ass!  Then, while we wait for our reservations they screwed up at the bar, my friends and I are given a cocktail menu that we ordered off of.  We ordered one round of drinks that clearly stated that it should have been about $30 + tip for drinks.  We get the bill and it says $60.  When I point the mistake out to the server (while clearly showing her the menu we were given), she is so dumb that she mentions that we also got a Diet Coke in addition to our 4 drinks!  So the Diet Coke accounts for the $30 difference?  What a moran!  When I asked her to bring out the manager as she clearly did not have one brain cell, the  server started giving me an attitude.  After a 10 min. wait for the \"manager\", I was told that they had given us the wrong menu w/ incorrect prices.  Apparently, the bill was supposed to be $60 although the menu THEY gave us said it was supposed to be $7 each.  We were not given an apology for the mistake or anything!    Because I have worked at a restaurant and currently work in advertising, I know that good customer service would have included an apology for THEIR mistake and then an offer to honor the lower price.  No such thing was done so I demanded a talk w/ the manager.     Only after I bitched out the manager did she apologize for the mistake and correct the bill for our 1 round of $30 drinks!  This after making us deal w/ this and completely ruin a fun night out!  After such horrible service, we were told our table was ready (as if we were LUCKY to be given our table 40 mins after our reservation time!).  We told them that we would not be dining there.  We didn't want to give this establishment any of our money!  We gave them a piece of our mind and walked out w/ the glasses in hand!   This pompousness and outright HORRIBLE customer service ruined our evening.  We ended up eating at the casual Asian restaurant in the venetian as we were so hungry by this time that we couldn't wait to try to find another \"trendy place\".  It turned out to be a good decision as the food was good and we got great service!  The best part, we ended up spending probably 1/6th what we would have spent at Tao.  I would have paid for a great meal, great service at Tao but the point that they would not quickly resolve the issue from THEIR mistake made me furious!    Tao, get your act together!  If you went to a store and they clearly had the wrong price marked on a sweater or in their ad, they should honor the lower price.  Same goes for the menu you gave us!  I will NEVER go to this location again!",

It's expensive, yes, small servings too, but it's an experience. The flavours are perfect in every way. Don't miss it!  The service is amazing too - really really efficient.

    "text": "Wow, just wow.  The service for my event last night gets five of the biggest, flashiest, Vegas showgirl style stars you can even imagine. Just walking up, the zen almost washes over you as you wish that the tubs full of rose petals were actually there for you to soak in.  But then you remember it's Vegas, and that's nasty, and the pounding music hits you and you're not so zen.  Then you're just overwhelmed by the design of the place.  You walk into one of the most perfect lounge areas I've ever seen.  Tons of cuddly couches and areas to sit with friends, all bathed in a very sexy candlelit glow.  The better to enjoy your foofy, brightly colored cocktails in - maybe do a little canoodling.  Now THIS is a place I would definitely come to if I lived in the area.  I had something very blue - called the Blue Zin I think?  (That's what happens when you let bartenders make your drinks, but worth it, it was delish) And a BLUEBERRY cosmo which just might be the most beautiful tasting cocktail ever.  But yeah, they really should've used white cranberry juice instead of red.  I am totally stealing that drink as my own. And seriously, I cannot rave about the staff enough.  From setting up the event, to the execution, we were treated with kid gloves and doted upon the entire evening.  Our crowd had a great time and I was swimming in compliments for an event well done, and I know it was thanks to Tao and their dreamy staff (cutie patooties galore!). The apps were fab (and not just because I set the menu) - I especially liked the duck, the triangular pork spring rolls,and the shrimp (which were not rubbery or chewy at all, but soft and almost flaky).  The food at the buffet was only decent, and the desserts just okay, but absolutely adorable (hence the one missing star overall). I would recommend this location for an event a million times over - they have plenty of nooks and crannies (or nightclubs or balconies overlooking the main dining room) to fit your group, and the know how to make sure your event goes off without a hitch.",

Did not like the Cheesecake Factory type beeper thing they do even though you have a reservation. The food is mediocre at best, if they just focused on Chinese, Thai or Japanese it would be a lot better, especially since they're trying to pull off a tapas thing. Nothing stood out as a wow, but they do use real crab in the California rolls. For these prices and since they claim to offer as shared plates, the portions could be larger. They have a decent wine & sake list and a full bar, which is where most of our money went, hello expense account! The servers were right on it, cute and friendly. I even chatted with our guy about changes I think they could make & he agreed and had his own recommendations, that showed that he was interested and not just a Tao crony. He was also flattering, not just for tips I don't think, but after that glass of 12 year McCallum to top off the night, who knows...",

For about $10, we ordered the chocolate raspberry fried wontons, served with vanilla ice cream topped with caramel and chocolate sauce. The decor was entertaining, over-the-top, and fun!

There were 5 guy of us that we each order a dish & there was plenty to share, all reasonable priced.  My favorite got to be their cooked Samon on the menu, just a bit suprise me, really good dish!  Lastly, the decor was really amazing they got this giant budda statue at first floor, there was some birthday party next to us that there were a guy working there hitting the traditional Japanese drum to celebrate for them, really cool.   Oh & if you're lucky like us to get in to the club afterward, the waitress stops by your table to take u upstair personally, which consider the crazy, busy amount of people they have, I have to say they did a really good job.  Just try it yourself, you won't be disappoint doing both the dinner & the clubbing there, in my opinion.",

The setting inside the restaurant was really cool and the mood inside the restaurant was very relaxing.  I started with the tempura onion rings which were $4.  The order came with only three onion rings, they were good though but I expected more.  For my main course I ordered the chicken pad thai for $19.  They don't offer differing spice levels so I just added sriracha to mine to get my desired spice level.  The portion size was ok.  I could barely find chicken in mine so if I were to come here again I would go with the vegetarian pad thai.  The server that was filling our drinks did a very poor job, He walked past my empty water glass maybe 8 times before I had to say something to get him to fill it.

Place gets busy fast.   Our waitress was awesome. Down to earth. Funny. Pleasant. Relatable. And most importantly , accommodating.    We started with the tuna on rice cakes. Awesome! Great portion size. Fresh. Not oily. Not overly spicy either.   We then had the cauliflower. Granted it was a bit on the sweet side, we devoured it quickly. Yummers!   Next up was the chicken pad Thai. Delicious! I was about to scarf that down as well. Unfortunately it was a bit too spicy for my wife (it was barely spicy lol) it had a nice kick to it.   Our waitress replaced it quickly with a chicken fried rice. How good can chicken fried rice really be? Oh it was all that and a bag of chips! (Bag of chips not included) Not oily at all. Seasoned well. Delicious.   Fortune cookie dessert! Holy momma Mia! It was HHHHHHYYYYUUUUUUUUGE (they're making fortune cookies great again ... Get it? ) filled with mouse. So good!  That's it!  I'll be back over and over and over again.",

We went to dinner on a Saturday night around 6 with a part of 6, and didn't have to wait for a table.  I got the Chicken Pad Thai and loved every second of it.  I think it was around $20-$23.  My boyfriend got the Filet Pepper Steak, and it might back been one of the best things I've ever tried.  The seasoning was perfect and the steak was so tender, I can't say enough good things.  I think that entree was $24-$28.  Definitely worth the price.  The service was good too, there were multiple people checking on us throughout the meal and refilling waters and drinks.  The manager stopped by to check on us as well.  Check it out!",

We got two bottles of Jameson   You have the option to choose your own three course meal OR you can do a family style dining where you get a large portion of EVERYTHING on the menu. We went with the family style and it was extremely worth it. We got huge portions of each course.  For appetizers we had the temple salad, sea bass, and chicken gyoza. The salad had to be my favorite of the three. The sea bass was also very delicious.  For the entree we had the salmon, coconut shrimp, and orange chicken. I wasn't a big fan of the salmon and i don't think anyone else was either. The shrimp however was a big hit, i really enjoyed the size and the peanut curry glaze! I had about two of them and I was already full. The orange chicken had good flavor but it was really dry like the chicken was over cooked.  For dessert we got fried chocolate spring rolls, yoga sugar dusted donuts, and seasonal fresh fruit with mandarin ice cream! The fresh fruits came with kiwis, blueberries, mangoes, grapes, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries! The donuts were really good and tasted fresh. I wasn't a big fan of the spring rolls with dark chocolate like inside.   After every course, the servers would come by and change our plates and utensils. The food came out quickly which is definitely a plus!  Overall, if you go with a group of friends I definitely recommend the dinner style! you get to try all the goodies AND it comes with huge portions!",

I now know to check at restaurants to make sure they're giving me the actual lobster, and not the cheapest parts. Even the sprite they gave me tasted bad. The waiter was rude and seemed annoyed that I couldn't hear him, even though the music was super loud.

Having experienced a bad night of service at another five star restaurant in the strip for my wife's birthday, I needed Tao to deliver and not ruin my wife's birthday dinner.  We have an Asian server with a man bun who take care of us all night long and seems to be loving his job. We ordered three food items. Pineapple chicken and soy that's too sweet cos they probably throw too many soy sauce and pineapple juice in it. The pepper beef that has too many oyster sauce in it and the kimchi fried rice that has sufficient amount of lobster yet a little too little of a kimchi. Although we send the pineapple chicken back, the management way of handling the problem are top notch.  We ended up ordering another sushi roll instead that arrived pretty fast and tasty. When I tell the server that it is my wife's birthday today and that I would like to order that special dessert. He absolutely nail his job by proceeding with the most important thing he can do by wishing my wife a happy birthday.   The dessert arrived and it is still one of the best birthday dessert in all of Las Vegas.  Thanks Tao for saving my ass on celebrating my wife's birthday. Big shut out to the management and all the service staff.",

Craftsteak was my 2nd favorite restaurant, but this place is now in 2nd (Kokomo's for their lobster bisque remains at #1).  We came without reservations at 9pm after Phantom and the place was packed. Amazingly enough, we got seated immediately. The ambiance was dark, trendy with loud music. I loved the giant Buddha.  Our waiter was super nice and always on the ball as we ordered several rounds of drinks. I got the Taotini and my husband got the Orange Dragon. They were super yummy. ($12 each)  But the food...the food! I want to go back to Vegas already just to eat here again.  We ordered the small plates:  1. Satay of Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Roasted Asparagus.  - this was so freakin amazing. 2nd best bite of food I've had in my entire life. Flaky, delicate, tender and so flavorful. We'd heard about this from The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Vegas on the Food Network. Did NOT disappoint!!!!  This came with 2 skewers.($19)  2. Thai Crab Cakes with Mango Chili Sauce - best crab cakes I've ever had. Crunchy outside, such a wonderful crab flavor with a tangy & spicy mango chili sauce. 3 to an order on these. ($18)  3. Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth - we thought these were going to be crunchy, but they were soft and tender in a delicious broth. The lobster was so delicate and not chewy whatsoever. These were super yummy. 4 wontons. ($18)  We were so in love with the sea bass that we ordered another because we could NOT get enough!!!  We were too full for dessert. We loved our naughty fortunes. I absolutely will be dreaming about this food until we get back to Tao again.",

    "text": "Oh, TAO - I so badly wanted to give you 5 stars, but your over-hyped restaurant had some sever issues we need to address. 3 out of 5 stars for delicious food but terrible customer service. Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.  Here's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service.   Food: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in an order! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.  The service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was \"what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?\". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! Get in line!\" To which my boyfriend responded - \"I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call.\" The guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left.   Total time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!  The club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. I get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. There are MANY other options.",

I ordered the wagyu beef tartare, octopus salad and sea bass. The food was all good but overall the plating was very boring and amateurish. The tartare was very good except for the fact that being rolled in rice then flour and deep fried it totally covered the taste of the tartare. It was good because it was fried perfectly. The octopus salad was a total miss with overly acidic dressing and almost no octopus. The Chilean sea bass was the best fish I've ever tasted, absolutely delicious except for the fact it looked like it was just thrown over some vegetables. Once you factor in the $170.00 for one person drinking 2 glasses of house wine it becomes much less appealing.",

Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll - PERFECTION!   Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon - I wasn't too fond of this. It was too buttery for my taste.

I would have preferred fried rice from Panda Express over this lemon of a dish.  I had to choke it down with lots of water. With all the good reviews on this dish i hope what i had was just a fluke \"lemon\". The rice was soggy! And i picked out all the sausages to decrease the saltiness but that didn't help much. All i could think about was \"I spent $18 on THIS???\"   Definitely not a fan of the prices particularly  because the food didn't blow my expectations to mars - I mean, an $18 Lobster wonton dish was awesome but only 5 pieces? My mom could cook that dish and charge $8 if she served it in a restaurant. And a salty fried rice also $18 is NOT how expensive chinese food should go for...",

As previous reviewers note, it's on the expensive side, but Tao is not the place to go for a quick and cheap bite in Vegas.  I ordered the tuna tartare with peppercorn sauce - one of their signature dishes. It was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Their wine/sake list provided lots of formidable pairings (I chose a Sauvignon Blanc). Several others in our party had the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, but frankly it wasn't that impressive. It was served with tier of fried onion rings and lacked anything memorable in terms of taste, although it was cooked perfectly.  A significant bonus of dining at the Tao is that you get a line pass stamp for the nightclub, although the process of getting into the club was not quite as seamless as we expected. (Separate review for the nightclub).",

    "text": "UNBELIEVABLE RESTAURANT.   I ate here 3x (okay I was in Vegas for 14 days....) once with my husband (they sat us upstairs, alongside the glass so we overlooked the 1st floor and the huge statue, another time with a large group (13 ppl) and a 3rd time with my 2 friends.   Each and every time-- the meal was amazing. The sushi and sashimi is so unbelievably delicious. By far the BEST sushi I've ever had. The ambiance is inviting-- that dark, lounge feel with upbeat music.   MAKE A RESERVATION - and early! We tried to get a reservation for a Friday night (our fault for not calling earlier....) couldn't get one until 11:15 PM. We went earlier and had to wait about 35 mins, not tooo bad. We had a drink before hand - I had the something \"lily\", it's vodka, chambord, and pineapple juice - wow, amazing!   And great customer service. Maybe even too much, slightly. There is always someone at your table filling up water or clearing plates, which can get a tad annoying (particularly for my date night experience w/ my husband).",

    "text": "First night in Vegas and this was the first place we ate.  Honestly, I have no idea what was ordered since I was able to enjoy the sharing plates that were already chosen by someone else at the table.  Don't think of this as an authentic venture into Asian cuisine, but rather a high end of your Americanized favorites.  Everything that came out was very tasty, a particular stand out was the orange chicken which was outrageously good.  The pad thai, tuna sashimi, various skewers of meat, ice cream mochi, were all tasty.  There wasn't a single dish that was ordered that I would have regretted ordering.  The waitstaff was a little kookey (his personality was incredibly bubbly in an odd sort of way) but he was very, very attentive to our table.  At no point did my drink empty, always presented dishes on the right, and people cleared our table quickly once items were finished.  The kitchen was equally able to keep the wait times between courses very minimal.  Ambiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, kind of reminds me of Sea in Brooklyn.  They also had some pretty intense club music playing during the entire meal, apparently next door is a club so I guess that's kind of expected but it was definitely a club kind of atmosphere while we ate since the music was so loud.",

    "text": "So I went to Vegas to celebrate my 21st Birthday! Woo (bleepppppp'n) hooooo!!!!!!   I choose to have my Bday dinner @ TAO & was a bit disappointed :-(   The restaurant itself was amazingly beautiful. The food was just okay. I don't remember what the exact names of our dishes were but I had sea bass and my boyfriend had something with sauteed beef. Nothing special, but the California rolls were pretty good. Our drinks were good (can't remember what those were either, lol Vegas+alcohol = forgetfulness). However, I do remember that overall, the food was okay, the drinks were okay, and restaurants decor was gorgeous, and I don't remember our waiter either so they were probably just ok.   They did surprise me with a giant fortune cookie with fruit since it was my Birthday and that was very sweet, that's where my extra star comes Iol, if it wasn't for that, I would have given it 3 stars.  Didn't go to the nightclub but hopefully next time I'll check it out. I would go back to the restaurant for its apitizers and drinks, not sure about the food.",

    "text": "Always a good combination of food, fund and flare.  Just be sure to get there early (before 6:30 PM unless you have a reservation).  The dishes are always scrumptious, from tuna on rice, to sushi combinations to simple edamame.  And for Sake lovers, the menu is F - I - N - E.  But be prepared to shell out some dollars.  So have a cocktails (or 2) before heading to this treasure trove of Asian splendor.  Order an appetizer to share (I like the edamame, tuna...well, I really haven't had anything bad), then move into something more substantial.  Consider splitting dinner or even a few appetizers.  (You're in Vegas...save your money for the tables or the streets!)  But when you finally have to eat...skip the buffet's.  I mean, let's face it, you don't know when the last kid sneezed on it, right?  Go to Tao's an experience some zen....ah'uummmmmm.....",

    "text": "We dined with a group of 6 and really looked forward to an amazing experience since I had heard so much about their menu and incredible flavors.  When our waiter arrived he tried to explain their signature dishes as well as his personal favorites.  Everyone basically wanted a tasting menu but a couple of people had specific dietary restrictions.  That said, we all started the first course which came out with 6-7 different dishes which we shared family style.  Actually full at that moment our waiter came out with 3 large platters of rolls and sashimi.  Not knowing what to do we all started to eat it because it was a part of the \"tasting menu\".  Feeling very uncomfortable and more than full, our waiter said that he was coming with the dessert.  At that time we all said \"please don't!\"  What was supposed to be a great dining experience turned into the waiter not realizing that the tasting menu should have been changed to accommodate a normal person's appetite.  Seriously it was way too much food for 6 people and probably could have served 12.  Sorry Tao but the 3 stars are for inappropriate ordering for your guests not for flavor which by the way was amazing!!",

    "text": "This place is great! The food was awesome. If you come here and you don't get the lobster dumplings you are doing yourself a disservice. The server said their signature dish was the miso sea bass, definitely worth trying, and our server suggested the sausage fried rice with fried egg on top, also amazing. Service was great, drinks were tasty.   So why only 4 stars?  A couple reasons. Number one, I don't like being sold something right away. When we sat down our server briefly went over the drink lists and immediately asked if we wanted something from the bar. Nice to ask, but how about giving us some time to look through the lists you just pointed out. Or even better, how about offering some water first.  And when I say offering, I mean offering all options. Not just bottled water. It just seems like a sneaky way to get just a little more money out of me. I don't want to feel like I'm at a car dealership when I'm eating at a restaurant.   The second reason for the downgrade was the robotic repetitiveness in the restaurant. Explanation. We got our appetizers, ther server came by and asked us if we had everything we needed and we said we were fine. 5 minutes later a  manager came by and asked us if we have everything we need and we said we were great. Our entrees came out and our server asked if we had everything we needed, we were fine. A few minutes later a different manager came by and asked us...you guessed it, do we have everything we need. Not how is the food or how are we enjoying everything so far, just do we have everything we need. Now, you might say to yourself that's not so bad. But it was just me and my friend, and all the tables of two are literally right next to each other so we can hear the interactions of all the tables around us.  We had 3 tables within earshot of our own, and I must have heard \"do you have everything you need?\" 15 times between the servers and the managers. It's one of those things that once you notice you can't help but hear it.   Normally I wouldn't even nitpick over something so trivial but i also heard the other servers in the area ask for drink orders immediately and only offer bottled water.  These are all clearly restaurant policies that take away from the restaurant. I don't want to feel like a step in a training manual. All those little annoyances aside this restaurant is awesome. It's not the quietest restaurant in the world but as long as you understand you are eating essentially at a nightclub I highly recommend this place.",

I dined here with a group of 8 and we never waited for anything, which was great but also expected at the level of restaurant that this was not to mention it's in Las Vegas and goes with the territory.    I ordered the Black Pepper Filet with Udon Noodles it had a great strong flavor, I liked it for the most part however later on I burped pepper steak all night which is not very sexy when you're partying.  The Chilean Sea Bass was a popular dish at our table (aka Patagonian Toothfish which is currently over fished and should be avoided by all chefs and consumers!)  My husband ordered the Wasabi Steak it was surprisingly mild, but good.  Additionally ordered was the Shabu-Shabu, the presentation was quite nice and after eating this multiple times recently in Japan I felt that it was translated nicely.   The Chef's Roll was a great starter as well as the Lobster Dumplings.",
