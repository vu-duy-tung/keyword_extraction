Collar green used to be my go-to vegetable choice, but lately it's very salty so I just stick with salad.  Each salad bar has different selection, so check out both if you want to have salad.  I would skip the Chinese, not even up to Panda Express quality.  My favorite dessert is the walnuts tart.  Ice cream didn't taste like ice cream, more like yogurt or something very artificial.",

When a family of four can eat there for 20 bucks (with coupon), all you need is to impress me with about 10 dishes that I can rotate on all of my trips.  The Orleans is like the Costco of casinos: not much flash, but plenty of value.  Their buffet is the same to me.  Give me value: great food, low prices, and cleanliness and I'll stick around.  Alcohol prices are super cheap and the waiters are responsive and friendly.  The kiddies love the dessert bar, and I like the constant rotation of the food.  Chalk one up for the little guy.",

I decide to get a omelet with everything on it including the shrimp. The next few hours I get sick and my stomach is churning like threes no tomorrow. Everyone was fine besides me and I find out I am only the person that got an omelet with shrimp. So it has to be that that got me sick. All around the food was really bland or salty. I was stuffed at the end but who isn't at a buffet. You gotta get your moneys worth. Anyways I would've gave it a 3 star but since I got sick it looses both star and only is left with 1. Too bad.",

However, those days are obviously in the past and I seedom see myself going into this Casino. Recently came here on a week day for lunch costing $8.99. This was a reception for event I attended prior, making it free for all of us! I was at the same buffet 2 years ago and remember it being not that good. Contrary to belief, this time around it was better. The Korean style ribs was decent, not the best, but definitely edible. The BBQ section also had pretty tasty selections. I tried the pasta with alfredo sauce, which had a nice texture and a flavorful garlic taste. I had tirimisu for dessert and I enjoyed that as well. Overrall, \"good enough.\" I don't think I would pay money to eat at this buffet, but the food was good and didn't make me sick.",

There's nothing fancy or gourmet about it, but maybe that's what keeps the \"down-home\" menu consistently good.  Small selection at the salad bar, but the romaine lettuce mix was fresh and they had beets.  My favorite section is the BBQ.  The pork spareribs were baked to a delicious tenderness.  Sauce is served on the side.  Mac n cheese was  bright orange, creamy, and cheesy.  LOVED IT!  Other sides were simple but good.  The sign at the register said $13.99 for dinner but they were charging $16.99 that night (because it was Christmas week?).  We used our $1 off Gold card, so it was a good meal deal.",

Another amazing thing, we came on Octoberfest day so the price was only $10 a head! Amazing! It is like the Rio World Buffet but for a third of the price! Now I will admit it does not have all the selections of Rio but it was just as good! I do highly recommend you coming here for cheap but good buffet with a good variety!",

The oysters were absolutely scary looking. I've never seen oysters look so dried and shriveled up before. And there was a large bowl loaded with them. But we were happy with the salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams. But not so impressed with the $37 we paid for this. We could have gotten the same things at Asia Buffet for $28 and enjoyed the oysters and a larger sushi selection. The desserts here deserve 5 stars because they all are very delicious. I have no complaints.   I'll be back.... just not for Friday night seafood. Any other time I want to say will be my money's worth.",

Hey, I'm Chinese (or at least half)- you say \"all you can eat\" and I'm runnin'!  The breakfast is economical at about $7.50 (okay, I don't remember exactly, but it was more than $7 but less than $8). Compare that to a menu breakfast at Denny's or the like only you can come back for seconds!  Saturday night was my favorite night because they featured prime rib! They have two stations, one for medium rare and one for medium well. The rare is juicy and buttery! Mmmmm!! For seconds I went for assorted jumbalaya, seafood and crawfish which are regular dishes.  I was getting pretty full and felt it was time for dessert. I got up and came back with another helping of rare prime rib!  I think I'm going to be eating a bag of salad everyday for lunch for the next week or so....",

I was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic. (that's 1 star)  The buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other \"international theme\") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs. (that's 2 stars)  This is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes. (that's 1 star)  I got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table.  (that's -1 star)",

For me, the effort (grocery shopping, cleaning, prepping, chopping, stirring, frying, etc.) and time is not worth it - especially if it doesn't turn out well.  I'm so exhausted from my Graveyard Shift job, that sometimes I'll skip a meal because I'd rather sleep.  That's why I truly appreciate anything anyone cooks.  I understand the work that went into combining ingredients to create a meal.  With this in mind, I especially enjoy Senior Days at the Orleans Casino.  It used to be on Tuesdays, but now it is Wednesday.  After collecting 50 points on your B Connected Players Card, you earn a free breakfast or lunch buffet.  After 100 points, you get a free dinner buffet.  I believe I earned both a lunch and a dinner buffet!  I have been to pricier, higher quality buffets like the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, but for the price (free), I can find good enough food at the French Market Buffet.   For example - the dessert section... the fluffy cheesecake; and the strawberry torte.  I wish the torte's crust was on the lemon meringue pie!  I try to eat things that I don't normally make, such as the bread pudding, chocolate cream pie, and the gelato.  Those are pretty good.  Remember to get a plastic spoon from the dispenser!  The Italian section was okay - there was pizza, pasta, garlic bread, and lasagna.  Nothing really outstanding.  The pizza crust was on the thicker, softer side.  The BBQ area was interesting with its collard greens, yams, black eyed peas, hush puppies, ribs, and fried okra.  I had a well-done rib and enjoyed the crispy edges!    The Asian foods were adequate: spring rolls, Hot & Sour Soup, Egg Drop Soup, crab sushi, and shrimp tempura sushi...  The noodles loooked spooky, so I just had one for good luck. Some dishes looked sad and overcooked, like they had been there a while...   The salad bar looked fresh.  The fruits (cantaloupe, honeydew, and watermelon) were relatively sweet.  The peel and eat cocktail shrimp moves here at dinnertime so the crawfish can take its place at the Seafood station.  Dinner buffet includes Prime Rib at the carving station.  Breakfast buffet includes an omelette station.    I skipped over the Mexican section because by that time, I was full.  I had a bite of macaroni and cheese for my niece, but it was bland.    The service is quick and efficient.  The atmospere is energetic with many people moving here & there.  It's like a variety show!  The coffee refills are often.  Raspberry iced tea is available.  The long line to get in moves well.  There are many, many chairs and tables for singles and large groups.  It's just a basic buffet for everyone of all age groups to fill up.  The variety and value are noteworthy!",

When we were here a couple years ago, the decor was very dated but we were happy to see that the place had really opened up, was bright, and overall a major improvement from our last visit.   We had no problems with the service, all of the waiters were extremely friendly, and we were checked on numerous times. Our waiters were quick to bring us refills and clear plates off our table. She also made me custom iced coffee (not on the menu!) which was so nice of her.    The food quality-having been to numerous AYCE buffets in Vegas has really improved since our visit years back. On this particular visit this past weekend, there were two standout dishes for me: the pesto tortellini, and the al pastor tacos! Pesto tortellini is one of my all time favorite Italian dishes, so to see it as one of the dishes in the Italian section was a big surprise, and it did not disappoint! The pasta was creamy, the cheese-stuffed tortellini was sooo delicious, and the pesto was not overwhelming, and tasted fresh! The al pastor tacos were such a pleasant surprise!! We are Southern California natives so everyone in my party was super excited, and they were DELICIOUS. The quality of meat was fantastic, and the salsa gave an amazing kick. We also saw the al pastor being cooked traditionally on the stick, and carved fresh-so amazing! They also renovated their dessert bar, and I'm so happy that they added gelato- my AYCE Vegas buffet trips are not complete without it!   So happy with the remodel and improvements! I would recommend this buffet to anyone as they are really beginning to stack up to the higher end buffets located on the strip. Their selection is smaller but very unique. Very happy with the service and left very satisfied!",

A lot of the items are definitely frozen food which has been reheated such as the taquitos and burritos. There were three rice dishes all of them had extremely overcooked rice. The other dishes were extremely Bland. Honestly the best part of the meal was the cold glass of water.",

There was no wait on a Saturday after 1:00 pm. We were pleasantly surprised to find both pork ribs and beef ribs. The beef ribs were great but the pork ribs had a strange aftertaste. I loved the Italian broccoli and the onion soup (minus the cheese and croutons). The Chinese section had well prepared baby bok choy that was not overcooked like at other buffets. What was especially nice was the chart defining the gluten free choices and the dessert section which included a selection of gluten free options. The only picky thing was that the hand cleaners were hard to find and one was broken. $12.99 with players card is a bargain slightly off strip. Btw, it was less smoky than usual.",

I've been to buffets in Vegas such as Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Winn, Harrah's, The Flamingo, Rio, pH, etc. This one was nearly half the cost and was about as good as most. Nothing fancy but good and satisfying.  The service, on the other hand, was very lacking and almost non-existent. I basically got up and got my own coffee and tipped accordingly.",

Every Fridays between 4pm-9pm you're looking at spending 28.99 per person.  Go early because the line can get really long.  We went at 8pm and still waited 30 minutes before we got seated.    If you're like us and you love crab, you have two options here, steam and frozen.  You can also ask them to stir fry the crab at the Mongolian station in a yummy asian blend sauce.  Also, the oysters are awesome.  Especially if you can get them right when they first bring out a new bucket.  Freshness!  The buffet is split up into sections, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Salad Bar, Seafood, small Hawaiian/Japanese section, and of course dessert.  One thing I can not get over is their fondue station.  Ladies and gentlemen there is a chocolate fountain.  Yes, I just said it.  Running waterfall of chocolate with a spread of marshmallows, pineapple, bread, strawberries, and a few other items you can submerge into the brown gooeyness.  Awesome goodness.",

After a 40 min wait (not bad for Thanksgiving at 1pm) we got a table and it was really, really good for the most part.    The traditional Thanksgiving fare was not that great.  I didn't like the way they did the yams at all.  My husband thought the dressing was ok but I didn't.  The turkey breast was delicious but the dark meat was pressed in a loaf and slice, my husband didn't like it much.    However the other food was awesome!  Seafood Newburg, Jambalaya, Crab Stuffed Salmon from the seafood section.  Hubby had a plate of Mongolian BBQ that he loved.  The Steak with Peppers from the Asian area was faboo, tender and delicious!  There was also some Veal Osso Bucco.  It was new to me but really good.

Some foods I liked included the ribs, potatoes, roast chicken, shrimp, and pastas.

I haven't been to a buffet in ages -- at least not the last 3 times we've been to Vegas, but this time, I had a craving for peel and eat shrimp. I don't eat much else at a buffet, so I said let's go to the Orleans for their buffet since it's really cheap and I know they have peel and eat shrimp.  OK so the pricing was super cheap -- it's $7.49 for lunch -- and it includes non-alcoholic beverages. There were the usual bbq stuff, Mexican stuff, Chinese stuff, Italian stuff, and an attempt at Mongolian bbq, which was rather dismal.   I had about a pound and of a half of shrimp, a few slivers of bacon, 3 corn on the cob, a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crushed peanuts, 3 glasses of iced tea and I was done. I remembered last time they had these fantastic cookies, but there wasn't a cookie in sight. On top of that they have added a gelato station, but all the desserts were handed out, you couldn't help yourself to them.  For me, this buffet suffices because I don't really eat much at a buffet. Usually, I'll eat peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon or trout, and lamb chops if they have them. What's the point of paying 20 bucks when that's all I eat?   The buffet at the Orleans is fine by me. It has the shrimp, and I'm happy to pay $7.50 for it! I must say I remember there to be more selections so I have to deduct a star for this visit. However, I didn't feel ripped off and I was content when I stood up to leave.  PS: If you are my kind of buffet eater -- check out my review of the buffet at Palace Station -- I thought it was better than this one and for almost the same price!",

The chicken was dry, the salad was crappy looking...cheap iceberg crap, The beef ribs had no meat on them, the roast beef was juicy but was like chewing leather... I could only eat 2 bites. Some of the trays containing meats were empty. Without a doubt the crappiest buffet experience I have ever endured. What a joke..... you mean to tell me that on a Saturday, you can't supply fresh food when there's literally 200 plus people eating? You can't afford to put some romaine lettuce into the salad choice? What's sad is this poop hole is owned by Boyd gaming and they run the Suncoast Casino buffet which is decent. I will NEVER be back to this crap joint again.......What a waste of $20 for 2. Should have gone to the Texas station for a buffet.",

They normally make lemon chicken, sesame chicken and a chicken dish. They have a great selection in the mexican food part as well as an italian part. If your at the hotel i'd recommend it. You cannot beat the food you will get at that price.   Go hungry because they do have a great amount of food that they serve. The meat is great whenever they have it out.   Dessert is awesome!

I'm also not a big Prime Rib fan but I do at least like it to not be smiling at me. It was clean inside and looked nice. The service was great and friendly, which is unusual for a buffet.

    "text": "Came to the Orleans Hotel with a roommate who scored free tickets to the Bill Maher show (He was hilarious)... decided on the buffet since the line wasn't long and none of the other restaurant options there seems interesting.  Being a native Las Vegan who was born here. I have not eaten at the Orleans Buffet since 1998 when I was 16.  That being said I was actually surprised by it.... the salad bar had nice crisp lettuce as well as all of the other options for your salad looking and tasting fresh and crisp as well. the salad plates were stone cold too which was a plus!  Of the options they had on the buffet line I didn't try any of the Mexican or Italian selections, I stuck mostly to the seafood area (They had a sign out that said due to unforeseen circumstances they would not have any craw fish, when I asked, the response was that they wouldn't have any for another week.) but the peel and eat shrimp were nice and plump and easy to get into and the Seafood Newburg and Cioppino were surprisingly good.   The beef ribs were disappointing however as was the cut of prime rib. I also didn't like the Salisbury style steak that they had with a mushroom gravy, I went in at it with a fork thinking it'd cut right through it however the fork bounced back and almost took my eye out.  not much for seafood selection and as I said before the Mexican/Italian section didn't have anything that looked appetizing, the Mongolian section had SUSHI though which is kinda strange however the rice was pretty good and the fillings were decent for basic buffet sushi.   TIP!: MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR B-CONNECT CARD BEFORE PAYING!! (The regular price of the buffet is 14.95 without that card however it drops down to 9.99 after you get the card. 1 B-CONNECT card is good for two people to enter and the 5-10 minutes you'll use getting it is worth saving 5 bucks per person.  Overall it was not terribly bad however it wasn't amazingly good, but it'll make a turd.",

Kids ordered milk and as soon as they got it, the 3 and 4 year old started to spit it out saying it tasted funny. I took a swig and sure enough just about gagged. My father being as anal is as he is about serving bad food and causing mass illness in a public place, became concerned and notified the drink server and the waiter who didn't seem too concerned and told us they'd replace theirs with juice. Being the kids lost their appetite from the milk they didn't eat much. Again on the way out my father told the hostess that the milk could make people sick and they should have it replace. Her response in a sweet smiling way explained 'I'll be sure to let security know.' Seriously? How patronizing can you be to customers. Ridiculous!",

It is the most expensive on Friday nights so a way to save money is do lunch or a late lunch before they switch to dinner pricing at 4 but stop letting people in for lunch at 3. They have a bbq, italian, mexican, american, chinese, seafood, and mongolian/Hawaiian station plus desert.  It's fresh and good quality.  Not as good as some of the more pricey buffets but for a $9.99 lunch it beats the $35 buffets anyday. Make sure to get a player card for a better price.",

Ok, on to the review:  This place is great!  I dined with my wife and two children here for breakfast.  They have all the standard stuff: eggs, bacon, hash browns, pancakes, waffles, etc.  The cool thing is they have two omelette bars, which really helps the lines move, and ensures you get one, if you really want one.   The Mexican breakfast section was REALLY good.  I could eat the Chile Verde all day (which is probably why they put a two hour time limit on buffet purchases).  The wait staff was very courteous.  You don't get drinks at a drink station or anything, they bring you all the drinks you want/need.  By booking a room at the Orleans, I got a $20 dining credit, which I used to pay for our group's breakfast.  Since one of my children was under 42 inches, and by joining the \"B Connected\" club, I only paid a few bucks for our breakfast!!!!!  This brought back memories of the \"old days\", when buffets were SUPER cheap in this town.",

Getting around the tables in wheelchairs is difficult.  The lack of signage means diners wandering around to see what is where.  This must increase the dining time per patron considerably.  The food on my two visits was fair at best. Many items over cooked, dry and hard. A definite step down from the old buffet in all regards. Management was seen to be non receptive to a patrons complaint I observed and was borderline rude to her.  The upside is the table servers who really have to hustle.  Now ten months later decided to try again. As a wheelchair user, I was forced to a seat in the middle using the end of the table. Each trip for food required others to move their chairs as they do not comply with laws on accessibility. This also creates a safety hazard and no fire escape route. Discussions with managers were futile. They totally ignore the safety/fire laws in order to add tables to compensate for those they lost in the remodel. Handicapped, their families and friends should avoid it unless changes are made.",

    "text": "We'll I was expecting a way better buffet than before with the remodel. A bit disappointed with the food. The buffet looks more modern and better lighting. Only huge change was the look and the price. As expected to pay for the remodel the price has gone up a bit. Used to love buffets proceed under $20 for dinner. I think the new leader in town is the new Palms AYCE buffet.   The quality of food hasn't changed much compared to before. Ya it's expanded a bit but the only huge change I saw was a crepe station and a pho station which I didn't care for. The only big change I saw was the dessert station which improved a lot with higher end desserts like creme brule. They always had a gelato station.   My always favorite thing was to go there to eat the BBQ beef ribs which they still serve for dinner only. They also had prime rib but was very low quality of meat and tough. Who would've thought prime rib would be tough.   The Chinese section was decent the lo mein was good. Now sushi no matter what buffet you go to in Vegas is a must void food. They make it ahead of time and refrigerate it and you can tell the rice isn't made right. Anyways any buffet you go to sushi and pizza are a must avoid period unless you like crap food.  I honestly would only go here if I wanted all you eat beef ribs and gelato. For cheaper price I'd rather go to palms buffet way better quality. Even tho less quantity.  They also has a Al pastor station that looked decent.  The dinner price with players card was $20.57 you saved $2 with card. This is during week day.",

But it was not worth the wait we made in line .. we waited a good while in line , to be in the buffet to only be in there 40 mins in , not even finished with our food to be told they are closing .. because they were going to start serving dinner , in alarm my whole family got upset because we all hadn't even had a chance to get dessert , and we were NEVER told that we had to leave before they started serving dinner , the receipt clearly says you have a TWO HOUR LIMIT from the time you go in , and one of the waiters had to speak to the manager and apologized because we weren't the only table that wasn't told anything.. so they failed to tell many people and we felt rushed, until one of the waiters informed us they'd give us 20 more minutes to eat , which me and my family weren't happy about ... I think it was a horrible experience .. I think they should let you know before you pay that if you pay now you'll be asked to leave in a little while .. it was just not worth it for us , we left unhappy . And will not be returning .",

    "text": "Yikes! The Orleans Casino and Boyd spent 4.5 million dollars completely renovating the buffet, changing the name, layout and everything. I was super excited when I got a coupon for 2 free buffets and couldn't wait to give their new buffet a try.  Lets just say I'm glad I didn't pay for this.   On my first plate I tried their cheese enchilada (because how in the heck can you mess that up), rice and a few pieces of sushi. The sushi was inedible, falling apart, dry and fishy. The enchilada was over-cooked, falling apart and to say it was salty would be understating the salinity of this abomination. The rice, surprisingly crunchy.  I had literally one bite of everything and ditched the plate. I thought for sure our server was going to kick me out or something for throwing out an entire plate of food, but thankfully he didn't say anything.  Round 2: I tried the steak, a salad, some chow mein, and cheese ravioli with marinara.   So I ended up eating the salad for dinner (the rest was inedible).   Dessert was bland. Also, like every other casino in Vegas, they have those cute little desserts in the clear cups, and small tarts.... unlike other casinos, they put these tarts behind glass and you have to ask for the ones you want. So weird... you just know they're going to shame you if you ask to try 3 or 4 different tarts.  One guy reviewed the Aliante's buffet and said that if you wanted to know what the color beige tastes like you should eat there. EXACTLY! If you want to know what the color beige tastes like-- this is your jam. I would have been really upset had I actually paid the $43 for 2 buffets.   Pros: The place is gorgeous, new, and modern. Cons: The food is terrible.",

Medley Buffet is located in The Orleans Hotel and Casino, which by far is my favorite. I love the Southern feel it has and the buffet hours are from 8 to 8. We went on a Saturday so the price was 20 in change, we were a group of 8 and they got us a table quick and our waitress was friendly which is always a plus considering the amount of people there. Well, considering i was wearing a tight 50's dress i admit i did not eat as much as i normally would but I attacked the egg flower soup, roast beef, salads and shrimp for sure!! In fact, I enjoyed the food so much i didn't take pictures of it. ( except for a video i saved in snapchat lol )",

I haven't been to this buffet for a long long time, so this was the perfect opportunity to rediscover this buffet.  I was impressed by the selection of hot food items.  The prime rib, though, was on the dry side (overcooked).  My wife really enjoyed the jambalaya and pulled bbq pork with fried onions pizza.  I know it sounds pretty weird to me but she said it tasted pretty good.  I, on the other hand enjoyed the crayfish,  Their sushi was freshly made which was nice, compared to other local buffets around town which served day old and dried out sushi.  I would definitely go back for this price.  Okay, maybe not for a couple of week, since I ate way too much in one sitting.",

It has always been my favorite buffet and game me an excuse to spend the day in the casino, aside of the many times that I have stayed at the Orleans. However, I went to the Orleans on 7/4/17 to go to the buffet followed by the casino visit. The regular buffet area was closed and they had a mock buffet on the other side of that part of the casino. The line wasn't long, but we had to wait for 45 minutes to be seated. The food was about 1/4 of the amount of choices that the other buffet had, and it was of poor quality. The employees were commenting on how bad this was. We got it over with and I lost interest in the casino. I emailed the Orleans and received a response from Rhonda, the buffet manager. Basically I was told that that's just the way it is. They charged the regular price and did not notify their gambling customers that there was a change. Rhonda said that she hopes that I will come back to that buffet sometime, though wasn't acknowledging that there was a problem with their setup. I'm done there and maybe someone else will avoid wasting their money sometime.",

There is a massive hallway in the middle of the dining area that is not used, from what we could see.  The food is now distributed all along the back rather than utilizing cold tables just to the fore of hot service.  It was so convenient.  We both picked two different eggs Benedict for breakfast that were supposedly on steam tables in terrines, which looked warm and savory.  They were both cold and awful.  Neither one of us could eat them.  So wasteful.  Waiting for a table was also long and weary, even though the number of people was about 20.

Service:   The service was okay - our waiter was a bit slow and they didn't really clear out our plates as quickly as we ate...actually it would stack up quite a bit before he or anyone came to clear it. He was also hard to wave down to get refill on drinks. It did get a little busier with big parties of people coming in - looked like there was a graduation somewhere cause a lot of graduates came in to eat with their families.   Food:  They have pretty good selection of cuisines and not to mention an unbelievable amount of choices at the dessert section. They had a lot of comfort food for sure - fried chicken, mac n cheese, jambalaya, etc. What's interesting was that they had really good pizza - usually buffet pizzas are okay - but the pizza here was really cheesy and the crust was really perfect - not super thick and not too thin - so to my surprise I think their pizza was pretty awesome.   They had a lot of good choices for desserts too - 7 different flavors of Gelato - the peach ice cream was the best and the Watermelon Sorbet was very refreshing. In addition, they also had Tiramisu, red velvet cake, cookies and just too many to name - However I did like their Chocolate Cream Pie the most - it was pretty heavenly.   Overall this was a pretty decent buffet for a pretty fair price - at least for lunch. I would come back here again.",

Palm's new 24 Cafe has similar decor. I have the seafood buffet. They raised the price by about $3/person without raising the food quality. The food selection is the same, but the quality becomes a little worse. For example, the crab legs are much smaller than before.  The worse part is the service. Our server is Loiter.  She never refilled our drinks. She just cleaned out the dishes. She can walked up to me and asked was everything ok when my glass in front of me was empty. Could you just open your eyes and see we need refills? My friend and I stayed to have some girly talks. Our server just walked past at least 5 times without making eye contact or refilling our drinks. She probably trying to chase us away, so she can rest.  Anyway, I won't recommend this place. It's over price with so so food and bad services.",

I believe this to be the Best Buffet in Vegas. I have eaten at several including the Rio and Bellagio.   The French Market Buffet at the Orleans is a much better value than the others. On Friday's it is higher than other days, but being Catholic I appreciate that almost everything they serve at all the stations is seafood.   For under $20 on Friday, I piled high plates with crab and shrimp. Had civeche, shrimp fajitas, fish, sushi, clam strips, oysters, a smorgasbord of seafood. Everything was delicious.   There are also a ton of desserts to choose from.",

They also offer good discount deals for their player's club members. The lines can get long if you come right at the peak of service (like 9am for breakfast; noon for lunch; or 6pm for diner).  They've got the various food stations based on either type of food or region.  BBQ, seafood, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. Two salad bar stations and a center desert island with cakes, pastries and ice cream round out the mix.   The servers are all busy, efficient and make multiple stops by your table to fill drinks and take away plates as you grub your way through your meal session.   Some of the food is decent, some you'll pass on depending on freshness and others you won't even touch.  That's what keeps a buffet fun and you on your toes.",

Instead of labeling it sour cream/horseradish mix they call it sour cream. Desserts are dry. The carrot cake especially.  There's a breakfast station too, although I couldn't find it. Everything I had was bland, dry or had a funky taste to it: chili tasted like corn, dumplings bland & dry, same with fried rice. Someone in my group found it & he took one bite of scrambled eggs & pushed his plate away. I'm not a buffet person but have been to a few that are actually good. This isn't one of them. It's easily the worst in town. I stopped for lunch elsewhere after \"lunch\" here. Servers were nice & attentive.",

My favorite was the desert bar which had so many options, it was hard to make a decision. The desert bar even serves Gelato hand scooped by a server : )    One thing that turned me off was seeing children put their fingers in the chocolate fountain, while their parents were standing right there!   If you are in search of an off \"The Strip\" buffet on a budget, this is your answer. Just don't eat from the chocolate fountain ; )",

The Scrambled eggs looked RAW and the Sausage was burnt. The eggs benedict wasn't appealing at all.  Overall they had decent variety but bad quality service and very poor quality food.

    "text": "Food here is average. Ate here many times. This review is a classic \"I was mistreated\" type of review.   I showed up 3 min late. My fault no doubt. Along with about 10 others who were turned away. Considering just two days ago I got in line 10 min late I was surprised that they were enforcing the clock so strictly. But \"rules are rules.\"  What I can't handle, though, is being lied to. I was watching hundreds of people in line for a buffet, and they told me that they \"didn't have someone who can take my money.\" (lie) Then I'm told there are \"no open tables,\" when I could see many open tables. (lie #2) Our group is then told that there is a \"power issue\" (possible lie). I asked, \"so what about all those people in line to eat, are you going to make them all leave?\" She says \"yes.\" I was floored and said I would like to see that... So she then starts going table to table, but nobody actually leaves.  I know this because at this point I was standing away from the front door looking at my phone deciding where to go for food when hotel security surrounds me ...  Now ... I know that I was late and I know that they weren't going to let me in. I lost, I moved on. I never yelled, I never made threats or swore. I had what I thought was nothing more than a conversation with a restaurant manager. The fact that she resorted to calling security shows that she is out of her depths in a position of leadership. I cannot imagine what she would have done if I truly was a risk.   I can handle being rejected. But if you are going to obviously lie to me then I have a problem with you insulting my intelligence. Just say, \"sir, we don't want to let you in \" and be done with it. Telling me you \"can't\" and then making up of a bunch of made up nonsense is really insulting.  And a manager should learn how to be firm without having to call security. That was downright offensive and embarrassing.",

(We'd been here years ago, but I think that it was seafood night.)  Since I had the baby, my system has gotten a little sensitive to certain dishes so I went the safe route and stuck to a few choice items: shrimp scampi- didn't really taste like it was supposed to but eatable (didn't get seconds), chicken gumbo (good considering the averageness of the buffet as a whole), peel 'n eat shrimp- who can mess this up, right?, mussels- a tad overdone but eatable, green beans- surpsingly a crispness to it, and not soggy, prime rib- good, once you cut out all the fatty parts (and there was a lot of it). There were salads, mexican, seafood, carving stations, asian including a mongolian feature, and pasta.   I still find that some people get a little crazy when it comes to food, and that there will always be an impatient person right next to you or someone who wants to create their own line when there is already a clearly defined line started. The majority of the diners were good, except there were a couple kids playing and when there is a big crowd, that type of horseplay is not appropriate period.  An average Las Vegas casino buffet is the best way I can put this place, not the worst, not the best, just right smack-dab in the middle. To tell you the truth, the desserts ARE better than the food selections- there were No-Sugar selections as well, in addition to the pies- pumpkin and pecan, cakes- red velvet cake, slice of rolls- lemon or raspberry, cookies, macaroons, plus ice cream and gellato- about 9 flavors like cookies 'n cream, coffee (delish!!!), watermelon sorbet. Just steer clear of items like cake slices that were the obvious leftovers. I made the mistake of grabbing a red velvet slice, against my better judgement, and had to take off the entire side because it had hardened a bit- eww.  There was a lot of refilling of dishes going on by the workers, which meant there were a bunch of customers here. It was a good crowd for a saturday night. It wasn't too noisy, since our baby got to nap a bit. I also noticed a Hand Sanitizer station in between food stations, which you don't see a lot in a typical Vegas buffet. The drink server was good except she kept missing asking one person in our party.   FYI- get the card so you don't feel like you just wasted your money; it's a few dollars cheaper when you \"get connected.\" $12.99 for saturday dinner.",

It's even better if you're a gambler there because you get a discount, sometimes a comp!  I have been coming here for years, and the food is always consistently good.  They offer the usual American-Asian-Mexican-Italian-salad bar standard that I've come to expect in the average buffet here in Vegas, so you shouldn't feel like you won't find something you'll enjoy.  I eat here once a week or so, and my favorite go-to items are their BBQ items... I love their ribs and their brisket!  I also judge buffets by their mashed potatoes and I believe this buffet has some of the best in town -- none of that powdered potato crap, this stuff is legit, smothered in yummy butter!  They have a mongolian grill if you're the type who likes fresh-grilled asian fare as well.  They have a really great selection for dessert!  Although my favorite is always the gelato, if you're lucky enough for them to have chocolate chip cookies that day, make sure you swoop some up!    I usually go for lunch or dinner, but the other day I woke up early enough for the breakfast buffet for the first time in a long time, and was pleased to see that they offered many gluten-free items, and their made-to-order omelets were on point!  Great selection and affordably-priced, this is my little gem of a buffet off the strip.",

The price is a bit expensive (over $13) but if you sign up for a free B-connect membership, your meal admission is only $9.99! Need I repeat it? All You Can Eat Prime Rib for only $9.99!  I have to say the quality of the selections there is pretty good, considering how much you pay for your meal. I was pleasantly surprised at the Chinese section, since the stir-fried vegetables and eggplant dish was pretty delicious. Usually, in my experience, I usually avoid the Asian section when I go to buffets (except for sushi) since the food ends up tasting like Panda Express.  But other than that, I really did enjoy the dessert! They had ice cream flavors ranging from Vanilla, Coffee, Mango, and Peach. Also there were sorbet flavors such as Passion Fruit (My fav! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!), Lemon (another hit!), and Watermelon.  I definitely recommend this place, especially if you sign up for your B-connect membership before lining up at the buffet. It's worth it.

They had asparagus and grilled zucchini. The taste was nice and sweet.   They also serve southern food like grits , and Jambalaya. I tried the grits because I remember liking them so much when I ate some at Rosemary's restaurant but it wasn't quite the same. I did have fried scallops and mini crab cakes which were really good with a spritz of lemon. I also had chicken fried steak but it tasted plain to me because I usually eat it with a side of honey mustard. It's different ... but it tastes good! Unfortunately they had no honey mustard salad dressing.   My second plate I thought I 'd try their chocolate waffles. If you like soft waffles don't eat these they had the consistency of toast. I also grabbed some scallop mixture they had cradled in a shell it's not as tasty as the ones at Asia buffet. I would pass these up.I also tried a cheese blintze but I could only take a bite the cheese inside was all crumbly.   My dessert plate was my favorite because they had this almond crumb cake that had drizzled raspberry sauce in it. They used to serve this at Red Rock casino but I haven't seen it there in a while. It was so good with tea,. They also had Tiramisu cups which were really tasty the cake part wasn't too wet it was just right!   The most amazing part of the meal was my cousin saying this was her favorite Las Vegas Buffet . I wasn't sure I heard her right but she said this was by far her favorite. I was like ...uh okay. I'm just happy she liked it so it was a win..win situation!",

Tried it again today was very disappointed to fine they took the handicapped line away (I think the handicapped are more important than the Emerald players).  The food was a little better this time the Asian area was the best.",

    "text": "Every Christmas season a club my husband belongs to, which shall remain nameless to protect the dorky, has their Holiday \"party\" at a different buffet.  I say \"party\" because this group eats and runs.  Luckily, we were at a separate table with two couples who stayed a while, so it was a pleasant experience. This year's buffet was at French Market at Orleans.  I was dragged, kicking and screaming.  I'm not a fan of buffets unless they're 5 Star Yelp quality, otherwise why bother?  I don't particularly like stuffing my face just because the food's there.    We went on Friday night, which is Seafood night.  I like seafood, but don't love it, so right there my review has to lose a star - or two.  I waited patiently by the crab legs while the Great Unfed loaded up their plates to overflowing, then took my two crab legs.  I promptly gave myself a deep puncture wound trying to wrestle the crabmeat out of the shell.  I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR MY FOOD!!  I was happy to discover that the crab wasn't as briny as the last time I tried it, but it wasn't full of flavor, either.  I don't do oysters, so I skipped that part, and the peel-it shrimp wasn't anything to write home about.  I did like the baked salmon and the osso bucco.  The desserts were typical - looked great, tasted not so, except for one chocolate-covered thingy that had a decent chocolate mousse inside.  And the soft-serve ice cream is ice cream, not froyo at some other buffets.  That was pretty good.  I don't like pie, but I'll give this buffet a 3 .1415.",

The food options were extensive, if not terribly exciting....other than the dessert bar which was nearly overwhelming in variety of cakes, pies, fruit, gelato and even no-sugar-added caramel gelato.  Other reviewers note the different ethnic cuisine bars, but the Mongolian area offered bacon, eggs and other breakfast items at 11 am.   Price was under $10 with the free \"B-card\" offered by the hotel/casino chain (available on the casino floor.)   Slightly higher in the evening, but prime rib is included.   (BTW prime ribs seems to the the mascot meat in LV)  Considerably better and nicer ambiance than the usual Golden Corral or other buffet at a very reasonable price",

Hopefully Mr. Boyd does not show up at my house and takes this as constructive criticisms!  We had a comp, I still wanted a refund! the people in front of us paid $44 for 2 on Sunday Night \"Summer Sizzling Southern Crab & Shrimp Boil\". Which comes with a free beer. I asked the server about the free beer, he asked if he should go get it for us? What? I asked what kind, he replied \"Blue Bell Beer\" ... ummmm, again, what?   No, I guess we will pass, since we did not want to inconvenience the server.  Now, let us break this down - \"Summer Sizzling Southern Crab & Shrimp Boil\" - they got one part right, it was still summer. Sizzling? Nothing sizzling in here, maybe luke warm. Southern? Well, they did have crawfish, but they tasted funky. Crab & Shrimp Boil - yes, very bad crab legs ... shrimp boil? They had some popcorn shrimp that were kinda fried ... no boiled shrimp at all. Oh, and the meat?  They claimed it was tri-tip. Chewy and had a weird after taste  I have been in Las Vegas for over 20 years - and this was easily the worst buffet experience to date.",

Fresh everything, nice thick dressing. Great tacos and nachos. Good meats and mashed potatoes. Even the French fries and soups were wonderful.   Decor and seating is pleasing and comfortable. Not to smokey like the rest of the casino. Music is bad but not too loud at least.   I could dock a star but another server made up for our first server who took on 30 person group and literally just left us and never came back. Not even to say sorry or check in at all. Odd. The seating ladies, most drink servers, and the cashier were very nice. I'll not dock any stars for the one employee because overall it's a good team working.   I plan on coming back much more often now.",

We got in line around 12pm and, inspite of how busy the Medley was, we were led to our table around 12:30 :-)  The kitchen staff was on spot! There wasn't any cold dish anywhere, unless of course, it was meant to be cold. The meat dishes were tender and juicy. The veggies were crisp. The salad, fruit and dessert bars were equally good.  I thanked one of the supervising managers, after noting that two of them helped clear and set up tables to keep the incoming guests seated. That's teamwork!  It's no wonder that the Medley is my fave buffet. Highly recommended.  Now get in line before they run out of ham, Turkey, and steak! Not! LOL!",

Their food selections change, of course... but at the time we went, they were serving tacos, prime rib, pasta, pizza, and also had a crepe station. The dessert section is at right side of the buffet area. The soft serve ice cream & cones are tucked in a small corner at the beginning of the dessert section, next to the no sugar added desserts lol. The reason I gave Medley Buffet 4 stars is because they use a mini ice cream scooper for their gelato ice cream & they only give 1 scoop! Seriously, don't they know there's ALWAYS room for dessert?! Like all the other buffets, they also have cakes, pies, danish, other pastries and even cereal.   An overview of Medley Buffet... it's clean, modern, and well maintained. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and always comes around to take away the plates you are finished with. Great atmosphere and I would recommend Medley Buffet if you're looking for a buffet off the strip.",

Super delish  Sunday's seafood it's a little more on those days  I always come for the crawfish!!  Because it's so bombbbbb here  This is the only place that I know that steams the crawfish without seasoning it and it's the best ever!!! It's so fresh and doesn't smell   My sissy always make her own sauce for the crawfish and it's our dipping sauce so when we come we strictly come for just the crawfish!  It's my heaven   Everything else is pretty yummy!  This place is very worth it, prices are awesome and food is pretty tasty",

Let's start with the dessert station, most items were fairly bland, the custard tasted like more flour than egg, the ice cream/sorbet/gelato did not have the basic chocolate or coffee flavors not to mention the mint chip i did have was not very good.  The main entrees were over cooked, the fried items were too crunchy/hard (onion rings), fried chicken. The one redeeming item was the chicken gumbo soup. I won't be giving this place another try for a while needless to say.",

    "text": "This buffet represent a good value overall in comparison with other Las Vegas alternatives by balancing a decent selection of food with perfectly adequate quality in a nice setting paired with a reasonable price.   I must admit that I rather pick this buffet over some of the higher priced ones along the Strip since it offer a similar experience including a steak station for almost half the price without being \"inferior\" even if some of the other dinner buffets offer an enhanced selection in some areas such as Sashimi.   The steak station at the Medley Buffet is a nice thing since I prefer it over the \"carvery\" style (i.e. the traditional Prime Rib or Roast Beef station, which is common) and was a pleasant surprise for the price charged here even if Paradise Buffet at the Fremont Hotel provide such a feature during their Steak Night).  I consider the food quality here to be good in general but it must be stated that we are talking \"Buffet Food\" - i.e. not premium quality items \"made to order\". We are talking comfort food here but executed in an adequate way that make the dining satisfying.   The restaurant itself is laid out in a good way, plenty of space, bright and airy decor and the buffet area is well planned and roomy; it's easy to move between the stations even if the establishment is operating at capacity. The separation between the different stations is good.  One thing to be noted is that it is a popular spot for dinner so there tend to be a line outside and the ambient noise levels can be high during dinner. It is worth to get a B Connected card and one solution when you are two would be to send one party member to the desk to sign up for it while the other wait in line for the buffet since it can be crowded at both places.  It is also easy to get to the place by car or transit (bus 201) so the off-Strip location isn't a problem in this case. The bus departs from Tropicana and New York-New York every 15 minutes approx.  I can recommend a visit to this buffet for dinner in general.",

It's kind of annoying that they close the whole thing down between breakfast and lunch, but I'm not a huge buffet person, so this might be standard now. I think you need to be selective about what day/ meal you come here for, as some offerings are better than others. We came on a Friday and got here at 11, so we had to wait until noon for lunch.  They put bell peppers in everything and I'm allergic to them, so that limited what I could have. The barbeque brisket was a little tough, next time I'll try the ham. There will still a few breakfast offerings, but for the most part it was pretty meh. Couldn't find toast or even plain sliced bread, they had rolls to go with our omelettes. The server (I think his name was Alex) was very good though, so extra star for him.",

    "text": "When I was in Vegas last year, I came to the Orleans French Market Buffet. When I showed up this year, I was surprised to see a total redesign and re-vamp, now as the Medley Buffet.  First, although the previous buffet was cute and rustic, it was clearly aging. I love the new set-up and decor. Its chic and modern and I like that it feels more \"open\" and fresh.  That said, the food was hit or miss. Some things were pretty good, while others weren't great. The shrimp scampi and the stuffing were mushy, but the cuts of turkey and salad bar were delicious. It seemed to be like that with most of the food, so quality wasn't consistent.   Our waitress was a bit MIA most of the night. I get that its a buffet so you don't need constant attention, but we didn't see her often and that made it difficult to get refills on drinks or dirty plates taken. Other than that, the service was adequate.   There's a nice variety on desserts but I don't like the addition of having some of the small desserts behind the glass case and having to ask for them. It made it feel like I was inconveniencing them, or that I shouldn't take as much, even though its a buffet and had they been out in the open I would've gotten one of each.   Overall, its a decent value buffet. I would come here for a lunch and maybe a dinner again. There are better buffets around, but this wasn't the worst by far.",

I responded by asking her if she was in a bad mood? She said no why!! Then I said because you're being very rude to us.  She stated I'm not being rude and said she will get someone else to serve us.  Then I followed her and she was talking to the hostess Ana and they both were laughing, so I approached both of them and said I don't think it's funny.  Ana responded and said \"oh we are not laughing at you\", I then said I needed to speak to management.   I got to speak to the supervisor who had me and my friend write a report.  We then were approached by the manager (Rhonda Turner) who I feel was very professional in handling such situation.  I also want to state that the waiter they sent (Felipe) was very attentive and super polite.  Kudos to them both!!!  I can't believe the bad service we received here and won't be returning.  I still left a tip because Felipe gave us good service the remaining of the time.   One star as we waited 40 minutes for our drinks and the terrible experience from the first waitress Judy!!!!",

It's $7.99 for lunch and it's quick, its food and whare more would you expect given those two things.  It doesn't compare to many of the strip buffets in terms of the quality of food, but I don't think it tries to.    There is quite a large variety of options organized by cuisine.  I had a few things from the american and chinese section and a salad.  I did see pizza, pasta, potatos, fried chicken, meatloaf, mac-n-cheese, a mexican spread of tortillas and taco shells with the fixin's, and salmon that was actually pretty tasty!  There are quite a few dessert options to go with the many food options and there is hard scoop ice cream and I am a sucker for hard scoop ice cream!  The soft serve machine stuff doesn't cut it.  The coconut cream pie was probably the best tasting thing I had during my trip there, definitely recommend it.   Btw, THERE IS NO ROMAINE - it's an iceberg lettuce kind of place, but that sums it up.  That should be the title of this review. :)",

The line to get in was pretty intense, but it went by fast so didn't wait longer than 20 minutes to get seated. The French Market has all sorts of food including: American, Italian, Mongolian, BBQ, Mexican, Chinese, and Seafood. They have 2 big salad bars and a pretty good dessert section, but seriously, who wastes time with salad at a buffet?!   The beef ribs and prime rib from the carvers station were pretty good, probably one of my favorite things there on that day. I mostly took my chances with the huge variety of seafood there was to offer. The salmon, the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, craw fish, mussels and clams were all very good. The craw fish is sort of complicated to eat and so are the crab legs, which there was a crazy long line to get, haha. Fine, maybe I'm just dumb and don't know how to eat, but still I was getting impatient with the craw fish and crab legs. It's too much work for not that much meat, haha.   They had an omelet station where you had omelets made for you after picking out what you want in it. It was whatever, not too impressed, takes too long and isn't the best omelet ever. The whole USA section of the buffet is pretty bland, very typical breakfast foods, but boring and flavorless. and I love breakfast foods, but that was a fail. The deserts looked so awesome, but I just had a little bit of ice cream, didn't want to go into food coma after.  Too bad I was driving home after otherwise I would've taken advantage of the unlimited Champagne and made them fill up my Viva boot for me, haha. I really wanted to eat their usual Sunday night dinner which is rib night, but since it was Easter they had the Seafood Brunch special, oh well maybe next year.",

This is a place I would eat with my friends when hungover and dehydration has set in. This a wonderful casino with great service but the quality of food is fair at best. I've been here 2-3 times and have always walked away full. I stick to all of the food that looks and smells hot and fresh. Seafood here may be a gamble but I enjoy gambling at the Orleans. I have never gotten sick because I take my time to eat food that looks of good quality. The dessert bar was forgettable. The breakfast buffet is well worth the price. All in all, I would have to say the breakfast buffet is Key.",

The roast beef tasted like they put poultry seasoning on it the chinese food was over deep fried and when I finally tried the prime rib it tasted like it was rotten. The only good thing on the buffet was the Mexican food and the desserts were good. I stayed at the Orleans for a month and I wouldn't give them another dime to eat there that horrible buffet could be complimentary with your stay and I still wouldn't eat there again.",

    "text": "As of today, it is the Medley Buffet. A real big step in the wrong direction, IMHO. Whoever was in charge of this remodel was very foolish! Gone is the festive, colorful feel of the old buffet. Welcome to the dreary somber feel of corporate gloom. There are grey walls all over the seating area that separate you from the food and other diners. There is literally nothing to look at. I'll miss the whimsical signs directing you to the various types of food they serve. Still no restroom in the buffet.  I was there for lunch today and found that even though they raised the entry price, I didn't see any roast beef, turkey, shrimp or craw fish like at the old buffet. Perhaps I missed them because the food area is more spread out and there are no signs.  They also eliminated any dedicated line for disabled people which shows me that they don't realize that they have a much older customer base than most casinos. Maybe they just don't care. Remember, I said whoever is in charge was foolish and inconsiderate of customer needs!  Whoever made up the new pricing is also foolish as they post on the website and at door that breakfast is from 8am to 10am and lunch is from 11am to 3 pm. What happens between 10am and 11am? I called and asked and was told that if you come after 10am you will be charged the lunch price ($3 more) BUT you won't get any lunch items until 11am when they start putting it out! Who made this ripoff deal up? Maybe they were rushed to come up with this new ridiculous pricing. They only had 4 long months before they reopened. READ UPDATE BELOW...  To sum up, a cold dreary atmosphere, raised prices but fewer pricey foods, no accommodations  for handicapped people, unnecessary walls all around, still no restrooms in the buffet, and unreasonable high pricing etc., a definite step in the wrong direction for me. I much preferred it the way it used to be!  UPDATE: I went back today to the new buffet to take another look and found that I was given incorrect information yesterday. The reason for lack of pricing between 10am and 11am is that they actually close and stop admitting customers for that hour! They do the same thing from 3pm to 4pm. I'm retired and don't keep track of time anymore. I go to the Orleans to gamble and as soon as I either run out of money or get hungry, I head for the buffet. Now I have to worry if it'll be open since they close twice for two hours a day during the daytime. I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to gamble and eat.",

    "text": "I tried the new Orleans Medley buffet after the major renovation of the hotel, including the restaurants. Although the prices doubled, I was pleased with the quality of the dishes and the pastry section. A couple of months ago, I started going to the buffet about twice a month and it's been a hit and miss situation. One time, the ham was delicious, not salty and I could taste the caramelized sugar on the fat covering the ham, then other times it's inedible due to too much salt and hard meat. The brisket always taste like sawdust and fuel, over grilled. I used to love the corn on the cob, it was soaked in milk and butter but lately it's just in water, no taste. Most of the deserts taste like they were made of inferior ingredients. I'm so disappointed, there is no reason for Orleans with the money they make in their casino to cheapen again in their buffet. Now it's just like old times, only more than double the price...........sad! I'll never come back",

Each time I would get up to get more food, the seafood dishes would restock like the crawfish, oysters, and mussels. The waiter was polite and very attentive towards each table with their needs. The only thing disappointing from this seafood dinner was the crab. Usually the crab would be snow crab legs however today was dungeons crab legs which doesn't have too much meat in them.",

It is on Tropicana Avenue and it is a little distance from Las Vegas Blvd. (The Strip). They offer very reasonably priced food with great taste!   On Tuesday, December 20, 2016, we had lunch. On Wednesday, December 21, 2016 and Thursday, December 22, 2016 we had dinner. Each time we have been at the French Market Buffet there was a large selection of buffet items.  They offer several types of food, Italian (pasta, pizza, etc.), Mexican (enchiladas, salsa, beans, etc.) Chinese (sweet and sour, fried rice, egg rolls, etc.), American (turkey, chicken, biscuit, gravy, etc.), Mongolian (stir fried noodles, etc.), Seafood (crawfish, shrimp, etc. (sorry, no crab legs!)), and BBQ (Prime rib roast, BBQ beef ribs, boiled corn, etc.) A standard salad bar and a dessert bar (cakes, ice cream, pies, cheesecake, etc.) are also provided.  The chefs are very cordial and accommodating. We asked the BBQ chef for two generous prime rib roast meat to be grilled on the BBQ. He gladly obliged and served us.  The lunch is $11.99 and the dinner is $18.99, each very much worth the price. My wife and I both enjoyed our meals.",

We've gone several times four different meals and I can now say I'm happy with their breakfast! Someone finally learned how to cook scrambled eggs!! Salad bar is decent but it seems like they took out a lot of the other salad types to choose from. Steak options are good but they're always overcooked. I would suggest making them medium-rare and then grill a little longer for those who want thoroughly cooked meat, I prefer medium, the Mister likes medium rare - unfortunately we don't get that option here, it's either well-done or well-done. Dessert area is definitely lacking options, and flavor. Seems to be easier to get in these days though, as we haven't waited more than 10 minutes in line. It still could use a little more improvement in food quality/quantity, but a definite step up from where it was!",

Great selections for those who love Asian food ( which I do ). Their brisket was tender but the flavor was bland- needs some salt and some spice. Love the omelette station btw. Cashier told us they stopped their seafood night because of lack of guests and our server told us they have been cutting servers hours because of lack of business. Are we coming back? Not without a 2 for 1 coupon. I told our server South Point has the best food out of all our local casinos and only costs $10. I bet if they charge $10-11, they would see more traffic. Not everything is about the ambience, buffet is all about food and price.",

There was more salad variety, like seafood, edamame, cucumber. The hit items like Asian and Mexican fare look more fresh and appetizing  .We also noticed more of a variety in desserts as well. My favorites, oxtail soup , edamame salad, and Mexican corn !  Very very good !  layout is more spacious without the stations in the middle for cold items like it was before. What I couldn't understand was the Caesar salad station placed far away from the others and the breakfast was still being served at 1230pm. I feel like they were just there to fill space . Otherwise,  I still suggest you check it out !",

    "text": "A couple friends were in town and they were staying at the New Orleans. We were going to head to that other restaurant that serves mainly seafood, and I'm allergic.  And the story gets written err typed from there...  No line, walked straight to the cashier, and in...that had to have been record time for a buffet line! Lunch was on my friend so I don't even know how much it came out to nor did I bother to read how much. Probably wasnt interested as I could forsee myself never coming back anyway.  There are buffets you may try and know...just know...once you have your plate in hand and start doing the slow zombie walk as your eyes wait for something from the warmers to jump out at you...and nothing doesn't. So you forcefully tell yourself, just get something. And I did...  Everything aside from salads because I swear you almost can't go wrong with salads unless the dressing is gross or the salads are wilted...and buffets never screw up on salads...regressing here, okay...everything I had was bland, boring, and dry. That was me trying a dish from every country they offered. I even had a simple rye grilled cheese sandwich or something like that...and THAT was bland, boring, and dry. What the?! Service was typical of a buffet one so no comment. As long as we got our drinks refilled without asking, good enough.  So before I make this long and repetitive, unless you get your food comped here, or you don't want to leave the casino...then by all means. However, if you are coming here from elsewhere looking to eat at a buffet, I won't say DONT...but uhh....you know there are a lot of good places to eat out here.  It is kid friendly (but if you don't want the smoke smell since you do have to go through the casino then not so kid friendly) and stroller friendly.  Enjoy!",

They got the raw oysters, shrimps, big mussels, whole fish, prime rib and full rack of beef short ribs. Love the beef short ribs. It was so juicy and so good. Absolutely a very good quality of foods. I'll definitely be back next time soon whenever I were in Vegas.",

    "text": "The food was good, but it was not worth the high cost. I feel like it could use a bit more flavoring in its foods, and the overall area to dine should be remodeled to be better and more sanitary. Sometimes, Medley Buffet just seems a bit simple, with everything you can get from a normal much cheaper buffet, and I don't think it stands out from others. Don't get me wrong, good food, but just not worth the high cost. Vegas has other great buffets; Medley Buffet just isn't a great one to go to unless your happy to spend money.   Use the Boyd Gaming Card or BConnected Card to get discounts; If you don't use them, the cost will jack up faster than you think it will, and soon you'll have an empty pocket.  Overall an icky buffet to go to, an I probably don't want to go there ever again.....  Last thing, don't get too much of the Pho. It is basically Cup Noodles and it will fill you up before you get to eat anything else. Try not to eat the noodles, rice, fried things, pizzas, or any other wheat products cause they will fill you up completely. How do I know that? From personal experience that you don't want to know exactly what happened.   List of better Las Vegas Buffets in Strip Hotels: 1) Flamingo 2) South Point 3) MGM 4) JUST DON'T EAT THE OVERPRICED STRIP HOTEL BUFFETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The cost is only $9.99 (11 something with Tax) - which is actually a great price - not all of the food on the breakfast buffet is good but there are some hidden gems   DOs - bacon - it's extra crispy !         - tater tots - cannot screw these up!         - hash browns - crisp not soggy         - multi-grain waffle w/strawberry sauce         - pancakes - not super awesome but probably IHOP quality         - omelette bar - customize just ask for less oil so it isn't saturated.   DO NOTS - eggs Benedict - disastrous                   - standard eggs - just bad                Service is very friendly. The person assigned to my table came back frequently to check my coffee and water to see if I needed more and took my plates away.   Coffee is a go!  I only rank this 3 stars BC I've hit just about every buffet in Vegas and even with the $9.99 cost this one isn't rated up super high... But if you are staying at the Orleans you can get an omelette, waffle, pancakes, hash browns, toast, juice w coffee for around 11 bucks and if you got all that a joint it would cost like $30 so it's more of a bargain spot than one you would enjoy the food a lot!",

Good is subjective and lets just say there were lots of people that seemed to be enjoying themselves there.. I just wasn't one of them..   Options.. Seafood.. American.. Mexican.. Pasta (Italian I guess) Chinese, and big ol desert bar. Well It was all very plain Jane and wasnt something I would partake in again.  Buffet food is generally low end but this was really just the bare basics of buffet food. Lots of starches and low quality proteins. I guess that's how they make money but it was all very average and pretty sucky. The Chinese food was really bad.. nothing Chinese about it.. unless u figure Panda Express is from the mainland.. but PE blows this away in spades.. American.. was just crappy dried up prime rib.. with lows of bread and fillers.. Salad bar didnt even have seafood.. like shrimp etc..  I wouldn't recommend.. was just too low quality.. price was low.. like the quality.. $28 for two of us.. lol.. should have known..",

The price is unbelievable! $7.99 for lunch on a weekday! For a buffet! With seafood! and steak and dessert! I don't understand how they are even making a profit!  For seafood, they have fish, crayfish, shrimp and KING CRAB LEGS. They have a variety of american food (steak, mac n cheese, grilled cheese), chinese food, mexican food, italian food (pasta, lasagna, pizza), BBQ (mongolian BBQ and baby back ribs) and over 25 varieties of desserts.   Everytime I go to Vegas, I come here and eat my heart out like a little fatty.   Highly recommended for a casual lunch and a great cure for hangovers :)",

We came here with some free buffet tickets in hand (you've GOT to love free Vegas!) and without much of an appetite so we didn't try much.  Overall, the French Market Buffet isn't anything amazing, BUT it does have everything.  There were sections of food \"types\":  American, Mexican, Seafood, Asian, Italian and they each had a really decent selection.  The food was okay, the service was actually pretty good, and the atmosphere was typical buffet.  I think this is definitely a decent choice if you are staying here and want to eat on the cheap or with a lot of choices, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here if I wasn't (especially with the other [better] choices that The Orleans offers).",

The ribs are roasted in an oven, and then just before serving the cook slathers some BBQ sauce on the ribs, puts them on the fire for 60 seconds and then serves them.  There is no BBQ flavor, no smoke, no spice rub, no falling off the bone tender.  They don't give you a steak knife so eating them is a pain.  The ribs have been cut so that the only meat is the little strip of meat between the bones.  Very disappointing - but all you can eat - for about $10 if you are a member of the players club.     The salad bar had the bare minimum ingredients to call it a salad.  The deserts were more looks than taste.  Tasteless meringue in the lemon meringue pie, tasteless pumpkin pie, cannolli with barely any filling.  Best desert was the cream puff.  There are much better buffets in LV (but they don't have beef ribs).",

The breakfast is a fat kid's dream come True complete with pancakes, waffles, desserts, you name it.  By the way if you go a little later say around 10:15 you get to start off eating breakfast and end the meal with a little bit of lunch (spoken like a True fatass). When we got there breakfast was being served but they changed everything into the lunch menu not too long later.  This place makes losing money in Vegas worthwhile. And this is why I love Vegas.

I stay at the Orleans a lot because of the gambling and because I get comped (although I'm not exactly a whale - more like a minnow). So I often eat here. This trip I discovered Anton's Secret to Buffeting: try having a meal more like you would in a regular restaurant, that is by courses, or by themes. Usually I sample a bit of everything to make sure I don't miss anything good, but really, this isn't the only time I'm ever going to eat here, so why not be a little more discriminating?   For example, on this visit I had dinner here twice. The first night I did it strictly Mexican. It was not bad but not memorable - maybe the double tequila had something to do with that. On the second night, I had a full course meal: a seafood appetizer - shrimp and clams, a salad, and an entree of sliced-to-order roast beef with vegetables (although I did sneak  in a yummy rib). And pecan pie for dessert (ok - I also had some bread pudding - but how can you go to Las Vegas and not have bread pudding?). All was certainly as good as your average restaurant, but a lot cheaper.",

I liked the layout. One big section in the middle for desserts. Matching fruits, salad, and soup sections on each side of the buffet. And a row of everything else stretching across the entire length of the buffet starting. Most of the food wasn't the greatest but their BBQ section had to be one my favorites.  This new buffet is a lot brighter and a lot \"fancier\" looking than before. The layout is just one long row stretched across the length of the buffet. They have the usual Asian, Italian, BBQ, and Mexican sections with various items changed and even improved. The dessert section is a lot smaller but offered some better items. The soups, salads, and fruits section is ok. There's grilled steak. There's these thick short ribs which was my favorite item. I ate a bunch of them. The BBQ section seemed smaller but they still had the BBQ beef ribs which was good. They have crepes, pho, el pastor tacos, and those Mexican corn on the cob.  Overall it's not bad of a buffet though I've had better in the price range. It was about $20 for regular dinner, non-seafood night.",

Runny watered down oatmeal, powdered eggs for scrambled eggs, burnt black hash browns, omelet station burning everything, I think the guacamole is actually rotten..,not really any nutritious gluten free stuff unless you count the melon or canned fruit and ice cream, but the machine was broke...leaving hungry. Oh and the orange flavored gluten free muffin is the best if you knock off the hard lump of frosting. And there were no placemat menus for gluten free items.   Previous review: Gluten Free Buffet! Sweet! Paper placemat has gluten free items listed on it right at table so you can preview the available menu items. You can order your own gluten free pizza...although I didn't care for the crust. For those who are truly gluten free, guess what? The staff is KNOWLEDGEABLE ( imagine that!), about the ingredients in the food!  Only four stars because of pizza crust...hopefully they find a better alternative as mine fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork but the toppings were",

I went for lunch on a Saturday since we happened to be here. Line was fairly long but kept moving quickly. Be mindful that lunch ends at 3:30 but they stop ringing people up at 3:00.   The place has a very nice variety of food, especially for a frequent buffet lover like myself. They had some odd noodle dishes, fresh pork tacos, a noodle station.  They also had the requisite omelet station and three pans - which means the line moves pretty quickly. I felt like overall the food was pretty fresh and wasn't sitting out.   I wouldn't go out of my way for this buffet, but if you're already at the Orleans it's worth a visit.",

    "text": "This was our dinner the second night we were in Vegas. It's located in The Orleans, which was super close to the place we were staying at. There was a parking garage at the casino, so that was cool. We followed the overhead signs as we walked through the casino to get to the buffet. We only had about a ten minute wait in line on a Saturday evening. The buffet there is very reasonably priced. They didn't even charge our three year old grandson. I guess they know a three year old eats about fifty cents worth of food, then a small ice cream cone. I started with some peel and eat shrimp. They were medium sized, fresh and tasty. When I finished my shrimp, I got a slice of prime rib and a little salad. The prime rib was just OK, not really tender. The salad bar had a decent selection and good ranch dressing. The family tried a variety of different foods and everyone was happy. When my family members came back to the table with desserts, I had to go peek at the expansive selection. I noticed sugar free strawberry ice cream and got a small scoop. It was delicious! I thought it was just me, but everyone else in our party noticed what a sourpuss our server was, too. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Overall, a nice dining experience. And I was able to go to a buffet and eat keto.",

A wide variety of things to try. However, as I said, nothing is super amazing. Even with desserts, there's a lot, but nothing was worth getting again - except the ice cream that the employees scoop for you, with many flavors to choose from. Part of the dessert section is behind glass and you have to have an employee get it for you. However, the employee when I was there wasn't able to tell me what any of the desserts were when I asked! He apologetically replied, \"I don't know. There's too many.\"",

From what I could gather, there is no more seafood night.  There were so much shrimp dishes- butterflied shrimp, shrimp over ice, popcorn shrimp, deep fried shrimp, shrimp linguini, and a few more shrimp dishes in sauces and broth.  I'm starting to sound like Bubba Gump, so you get my drift.  The variety of soup like clam chowder, sweet & spicy, menudo and even pho were all represented with a few more that I can't quite remember. The pork ribs, beef ribs, the variety of meats on the carving board will satiate any carnivore eating habits.   This is our first time and we were so impressed with the clean decor, excellent service that was provided throughout the floor.    Stay for the gelato, the bite-size dessert and if you could believe it, their decaf Folgers coffee was pretty darn good.  To each's own, this place was a pleasant surprise for a buffet.",

They spread the buffet line from one end to the other without the middle salad bar. One cool feature I really enjoyed was the middle of the line a made to order crepe station with fresh fruit. My husband kicked it a notch and made himself a bowl of ice cream topped off with fresh bananas and banana foster sauce he then added to his crepe!   The salad end if facing the line is on the left, everything was fresh and the staff kept it that way while we where there. I even saw them change out the rolls with fresh ones! The opposite end is the desserts and the strawberry sorbet was way too good! Cleaned the palate.  There where several soups, it was seafood night so there where two gumbos. Sushi was decent for a buffet. I wasn't a fan of the warm crab legs, they seemed to be a bit over cooked, but I loved the fish taco. The filet was crispy and love the combination slaw with it. There is cold crab legs, oysters, muscles and clams as well as the peel and eat shrimp and crawfish!  It's been improved for sure. Clean, servers keeping up with refills and the line monitored for freshness! Friday night, seafood night. You gotta try it.",

I went up to pay full price is charged for children ,that's ridiculous! I ponied up $30 for 1 and a quarter of us ok i bit the bullet and paid. So i guess the buffet was recently renovated great, too bad the choices and quality of food went way down. They use to have babyback ribs now they put out the cheap country style that are all fat. I tried some roastbeef,baked chicken nothing was great.We got in right before lunch closed so thought we could get something edible on the dinner .We waited a short while got up served ourselves and came back to a cleared table . A worker came up with attitude and said i would have to pay the extra $17 a head to have what's on the dinner menu. Unbelievable these greedy bastards no way that's worth $32 .They made it seem like I was a criminal stealing food,can't believe they kick people out .fuck this place now!",

Oddly, I really liked the sushi - shrimp tempura and various CA rolls. And the prime rib was good too. Southern food was good - collard greens, black-eye peas, etc. Salad bar wasn't the best - iceburg lettuce mix and not many toppers. Large variety of desserts but none were great.    Server was great - very attentive and friendly.  My only complaint is that the hosts took a long time to seat people and did not prioritize those in the handicap line. And they were not super friendly.",

Great hotel, great pool, great everything despite it being off the strip. Best has been the buffet. It's was inexpensive and good. The locals loved it. Now with a new name and new look called Medley Buffet, it's the same food but much more expensive. Not a good idea. And if management reads this, your American flag flying above the entrance is totally torn up. Replace it please",

They got endless flavors of gelato, different kinds of cakes and pastries (some are sugar free as well).  Second...they have a good variety of food items available with a small salad bar, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and a BBQ station. I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to buffets. I really don't care for the seafood and all that \"fancy smancy\" stuff. Just give me the basics of  spaghetti and meatballs, eggrolls, enchiladas, dumplings, BBQ meats and sausages etc etc...you get the idea.

I'm sure there's better buffet's in Vegas. But they're AREN'T better buffet's in Illinois... So with that, I'm giving these guys 4 stars... The food was fresh even though they were closing... The food tasted great even though they didn't have a great selection... The Chinese was better than anything you get at home. The Italian pasta??? Same thing... A selection of ribs from different regions. And all were good... Round that out with all you can eat Prime Rib??? And I'm happy... The only downside was??? Where was the Cajun fair????? They had crawfish. And my buddy told me they had Gumbo... But I expected Louisiana southern cuisine. And it wasn't there... Oh, did I mention the fried chicken???",

The buffet has all the breakfast basics: eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. The price was fair at $8.99, but you get a discount depending on level of players card.  Highlights:  1) The Omelet guy- he was making five at a time. There was hardly any wait time. In addition, the ingredients are laid out like a Mongolian BBQ station. I liked being able to choose how meaty I wanted my omelet. I piled up bacon, sausage, mushrooms, spinach, and had him top it with jack cheese.   2) One of the trays had spam. Being Asian, this was a plus for me since I had it with fried rice.  Minus one star because the server took a while for the drinks and rarely checked on us. Other than that, it was a great value for the price.",

Most of these cooks in each stations from Asian to Italian and Mexican makes Table Mountain and  Chuckchansi buffet very forgettable. Also their server was really efficient and nice refilling my drinks. Every stations was really good it wasn't bland, it had the right amount of sodium the only thing I didn't like was their seafood soup with tomatoe sauce and their \"dirty rice\" dish. They even have BBQ beef ribs along with prime roast beef you can't beat that for only under $20.00 for AYCE. The buffet is nothing fancy but they have decent foods and good service also their desert slections is awesome so be sure to leave room for that. If you're complaining about paying under $20.00 for decent AYCE buffet I suggest you shut up and go to McDonald's or Burger King for you cheapskates.",

    "text": "Really more of a 3.5, but I digress.  So, let's say your family gambles at The Orleans so much that they get dining comps from them all the time, right? Since that describes my family to a T, lately, we've been going here about once per month thanks to comps that allow us to eat here for basically free.   Is it the best buffet in town? Not quite, but it ranks pretty high up there among locals places at least. As a matter of fact, the Feast Buffets at the Stations are the only ones that give this joint a run for it's money.   There are numerous Creole, Cajun and other southern-style touches scattered throughout. Most notable is the fact that it's probably the only buffet in town that serves crayfish. And eight times out of ten, gumbo is included as one of the daily soup options. Everything else is pretty standard fare, but most of it is done fairly well. The chicken wings in particular are always tender, well-seasoned and tend to fall right off the bone.   One major gripe I have about this place is how certain things aren't seasoned up to par. The last time I came I tried to do some makeshift Hoppin' John with black eyed peas and smoked sausage and it just ended up tasting like a bland, soggy mess. Another one is that desserts tend to be pretty hit and miss. The ribs are also tough as nails but I've found that to be True of ribs at literally EVERY buffet so that's just a universal complaint right there.  They also have a \"Mongolian\" section which is probably the most useless section to have in a buffet ever. Other than that though, you do get your money's worth here. Especially if you're able to eat her for essentially free. *Wink Wink*  The Final Verdict  Pros: Generous comp provided by The Orleans. One of the better locals casino buffets. Wide variety of cajun and creole delicacies available. Diverse selection of seafood as well.  Usually friendly service. Probably one of the fastest moving lines for a buffet I've ever seen.  Cons: Occasionally a little deficient in the seasoning department. Sometimes great desserts, sometimes not.  Decor in dire need of updating.  Huh?: Why is there a Mongolian section? Like, for real?  Suggestions: Replace that Mongolian section with either 1. A crepe making station or 2. A full-fledged Cajun/Creole/Soul Food section. Also, beignets in the dessert section! That way the theme comes full circle!  Return factor: 10/10. We're probably going to get another comp in the mail anyway.",

When a customer tried to make small talk and ask about the food the cook just gave him a nasty glare and shrugged. I don't expect the cooks to be all jolly, but it just felt since they aren't acknowledging guests then how can I expect them to make tasty quality food if they don't give a f$!k?! Plus, our waiter needed an attitude adjustment. I asked for sprite and she rolled her eyes.   Honestly, I only enjoyed the spring rolls and salad bar. I took a leap of faith with the passionfruit \"gelato\" (It looks like the gelato melts and they just refreeze it).   I was disappointed in the fried rice *sad face* and their sub sandwhich. The bread tasted rubbery and very dry while the fried rice was REALLY PLAIN. I felt like whoever prepared the fried rice did NOT know what they were doing. Now I understand why it was barely touched.   If I were to come back I would visit the BBQ spot. The guy on that side seemed very attentive and the food looked DELISH.

Well, I've come here for breakfast and dinner and let me tell you that right now, I give them a 3. Of course I am comparing it to the Mandalay Bay, Bellagio and Wynn buffet. When you have those, you cannot compare these buffets. Of course, you pay for what you get and comparing a 14 dollar buffet to a near 40 dollar buffet, you will get quality and choices. Service is alright, food could be a little better of course. Crab legs, reminiscent of those you can find at Todai's.  But yes, if you looking to not paying too much, or if your looking to not wait in long lines, or if you are looking to get away from the strip, then come on down to the French Market Buffet at The Orleans.",

From the beef that can't be chewed, to the ham with no flavor, to the dried-out turkey and the watery so-called gelato.....everything is barely even edible these days.   Had a great breakfast/brunch at the Sunset Station in Henderson and we're going to start staying there in the future as the food prices are reasonable and the quality is much much better.  Too bad, because Orleans used to have one of the better buffets.",

    "text": "So we promised the kids we'd  have a  buffet on this past trip to Vegas.  Just didn't want to break the bank to do it.  French Market Buffet was perfect for this situation.  Can't beat the $15.99 per person price for Champagne Sunday Brunch.  We were so happy that we could have peel and eat shrimp, crab legs and crawfish at this price.  The quality of the food is good, not great.  Definitely not the same quality that you'd find at a five star on the strip hotel, but if you are looking for good variety at a reasonable price, this is the place.  There was a carving station, great BBQ options, Mexican selections, Chinese Food , salad bar and standard breakfast fare.  The best part by far was the desserts.  Got our money's worth there alone....there was a huge selection of french pasteries, gelato, cakes, cobblers and other goodies.  If I was looking for top quality food/impressive selections, not sure this is the buffet I'd choose, but especially if you have kids, this is a wonderful option.",

Crawfish and ham were good, desserts looked good but I was lo carbing it. I'm not a salad person but the grilled veges, cheese platter at sPalad bar was nice.

    "text": "If I could give the FMB 3.5 stars I would. However, because I think when it comes to buffets they are about as good as you can get in  regards to bang for your buck. The French Market Buffet along with the Garden Buffet at South Point are my two go to buffets for the price, especially when eating with the family. I will clarify though, we RARELY eat the buffet because it is not always worth it when you aren't meat eaters. That being said - the French Market provides more veggie options than many other higher priced buffets at similar casinos, and they have a lot more seasonal fresh fruit than some strip buffets.  We happened to go for dinner on Saturday after seeing a movie. It was about  6pm, there was no line, and we paid about $30 (including tip) which is about the same as we'd pay at another restaurant. I usually stick to Chinese and Mexican with the addition of fruit and veggies, and this night was no different. Everything seemed pretty fresh,  except for some roasted potatoes. The fruit (mostly melons) was fresh and juicy. As always the desserts were good.I think the secret to buffets is as Anton mentions - eat in courses. That is definitely the way.  What you really must know about this buffet, and any of the non-strip buffets is that the food is not the best you'd find, but not bad at all. Don't expect the best Vegas chef's but you will get a meal here that rivals the restaurants in this and other local casinos.  On this particular occasion our service sucked, but that really was the worst we'd ever had at the this buffet. Since we don't eat the buffets often, it probably won't be until we have family in town to go back, but they are always satisfied, and so are we.",

The desserts are delicious too, plenty of southern favorites.  But yeah I cant say enough about the all you can eat crawfish.  You pile a plate full of crayfish, clean them, eat them, and go back for more.  So remember this place if your in Vegas and its lunch time and you dont want to wait in a long line to eat.

It's in The Orleans(which is the casino I go to the most after The Palms). Decent variety.  Cons: A lot of the food is pretty bland so every time I go here I end up getting the same things over and over again... The ~Mongolian section is random and weird(how about having an Indian, Caribbean or Mediterranean section instead?) Not enough Cajun/Creole/Soul Food, disappointing for a place which is always tooting it's \"VIVA NEW ORLEANS\" horn.  This is probably the buffet I've been to the most out of all the Vegas buffet, and it does it's job. It definitely hits the spot, but it's sorely lacking in many areas unfortunately.",

Many traditional Buffet items were also to be found.  Average quality seafood with poor to average preparation. Some items were over fried and tough - other fried items were barely cooked enough. Crab-legs were small - ensuring lots of work. A seafood stew was mainly mushrooms. The Clam Chowder soup was very thick with only a promise of clams. The Seafood Buffet was Pricey for the quality of the food. Very good service by the wait staff.   I would suggest this buffet for Breakfast or Lunch - or even better with a Comp or Coupon.  If you're playing tables always ask the Pit Boss for a comp - they will rarely(if ever) volunteer one. On Slots ask the Players Club what it takes - Before you spend your money here.",

I prefer this place over the Caesars dinner actually....the best deal on the strip is probably the $35 unlimited buffet for 24 hours offering 7 different casinos...PH.

I anticipated the worst, knowing that buffets can often be filled with steamed scrambled eggs and microwaved ham.  Much to my pleasant surprise (a la the Easter Bunny bringing me a basketball hoop when I was 12 years old), the food was absolutely delicious.  The buffet has food stations for different types of food, and they all have cooks behind them doing it up right.  The food was average priced, but so much better than any of the others I've had in Vegas (even the ones I did like).  Although there was a huge line, it went by surprisingly quickly because they had plenty of tables to seat everyone.  I took a chance on them for Easter, and I will absolutely be back on my next trip out.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice. First time was for breakfast, a decent selection of stuff to choose from; you have fruit, waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage (normal breakfast foods). Nothing to spectacular on that end considering the biscuits and gravy they had was below my expectations (gravy lacked flavor almost as if they were afraid to make that traditional peppery white gravy you crave with biscuits and gravy), drink service was also a little slow but it was to be expected for a Saturday. But then you get to the desserts which were available during breakfast; not only did they have donuts but they also had cake and pie. I'm a sweets fanatic but have a pretty severe nut allergy and the lady working there (I can't remember her name but super sweet and a little older lady with brown hair in a bun) was very understanding of that and gave me a full list of everything with nuts, cooked near nuts, and may possibly be contaminated with nuts. I was pretty happy with that since I got a fresh slice of the most delicious peach caramel cake I've ever eaten and convinced me to give the buffet another go but at lunch to see if it was better than breakfast. Second time was for lunch and lets say I was left feeling a little disappointed. The cooks  behind the buffet prepping food didn't seem to know much about the foods and had to go track down other chefs to ask if anything contained nuts or was cooked in peanut oil; while nothing was prepared in peanut oil other foods \"could have nuts\". Disappointing since they couldn't name anything that had nuts at all and I had to guess at what would or wouldn't be safe to try and eat. The lunch options were not very impressive either, the fried fish was kind of \"meh\" the pasta at the American station was very oily/greasy almost as if they had only boiled the noodles and melted butter onto them. Italian food left A LOT to be desired, the pizza wasn't very great but even bad pizza is good pizza, but there were not many pasta options. Plain noodles and only meat or marina sauce, a few options for various different pastas (none of which really stood out) and one sad looking vegetable lasagna. Drinks this time were quicker to arrive and be refilled. And then we get to desserts, whoever makes these do a superb job and they ladies who work in that area (the one from Saturday was there again) are the nicest workers I have ever met. They saved what would have been a disappointing lunch with the offering of a delicious blueberry cheesecake that I had two pieces of.  Overall: very average quality food offerings, except desserts those are superb; but the price is pretty decent compared to the other buffets.",

None of the pastries were phenomenal, the cheesecake was heavy and not at all creamy, and the blueberry topping on it had the consistency of drywall spackle.  Our drink-getter was pretty awesome, though.  She did a great job.  The best thing I can say about this buffet is that the lines are short and it's better than the buffet at a lot of the hotels on the strip, expecially those at the castle and pyramid... names omitted to keep from hurting King Arthur's and Pharaoh's feelings.",

I went after seeing numerous reviews in the past few weeks about how great this place is, how great the food is, how excellent the service is...   The best part of the buffet... new york strip steak, onion rings and some beef lasagna.   Other than that the food was mediocre at best, the desserts were kinda junky tasting and dry, and the service was very slow/rude. Our server was quite ornery and took almost 10 minutes to get steak knives for us after being asked. Never showed up with A1 sauce either. (She told us after the 10 mins and bringing back 1 knife... not 2...that she couldn't find any steak sauce.)   The guy who was supposed to be carving the chicken/prime rib at the station wandered off for over 5 minutes, and there was quite a few people standing there waiting for service behind me... I was about ready to cut the bloody meat myself for everyone else who was waiting.  So while the three foods I listed earlier were worth 5 stars (The new york steak is only on thursday) the rest of the service and food was only worth 1 or less.   Tragic...",

    "text": "After a canceled flight, I wound up spending my airline meal vouchers here for dinner and a breakfast. The prices for dinner change daily, depending on the night's theme cuisine. My night was BBQ and it cost about $15.  Like a lot of sub $20 buffets, the food offerings here need to be attacked with a strategy in mind. I have my own system for deciding what to pick, but the most important buffet rule is to immediately stop eating anything that isn't GOOD. There's a lot of crap at this buffet and a lot of stuff that's so-so, but there's some real good stuff to be eaten, as long as you're not busy chowing down on dried-out, fake, instant, imitation, bland funk.  I found the roasted chicken to be excellent, like actually worthy of being on a plate being served in a regular restaurant. The crawdads were unique and it was my first time trying them. I didn't care for the taste, but I don't have anything to compare them to, so I switched over to the peel and eat shrimp. The salad bar was decent enough. The bread pudding was amazingly good. The service sucked, as my water was never refilled, I had to scrounge for a second napkin, and at one point my table was totally cleared while I was up getting more food.  Breakfast was about $8. The OJ was fake and tasted funny. The coffee was not bad, but not good. Skip scrambled eggs as they're fake too. Instead, get your eggs off the top off the Benedict offerings. You don't want to eat the whole Benedict, just the egg, as the rest is gross. I have a weakness for cheap-o breakfast sausage with syrup on top and I wasn't disappointed. Don't bother hoping for a nice pastry to pair with your last cup of coffee because they're all pretty horrible.  Overall, FMB is worth the price it seems, but don't think you're going to get the variety of a full buffet, as most of the food is no good. Be picky and search out the few gems to be found, then jump in with both feet.",

    "text": "This place is an awesome value for the money. It was cheap to begin with, but they recently lowered prices and you still get a discount with a Coast Card, even if you have no points on your card. A lot of people seem to just go for the crawfish, which were OK, but nothing special since they appear to have just been boiled in water. I'm used to them being boiled in seasoning so I don't really like them plain. However, there is so much more to eat than the crawfish. The salad bar is nothing special, but they had watermelon. I think they are just coming into season since I didn't see them at too many other buffets. There were lines for the watermelon here. I was lucky to grab some just as they were restocking.  My friends reported the BBQ station was very good, but I mostly skipped it since we had Brazilian BBQ the night before and I wasn't really in the mood for more meat. I ended up eating a lot from the Cajun station and the USA station. The Asian station had stuff for Mongolian BBQ, but I didn't see too many people take advantage of it. I should have since I love Mongolian BBQ, but I really couldn't take too much grease that day. The Mexican station had stuff for DIY tacos, but I was too lazy. The pasta station was probably the most disappointing. The pizza was OK, but the other items were either horribly mislabeled or complete failures. It could have been the former since they did have Salisbury steaks in the USA section labeled as terriyaki chicken.  The dessert section is a big surprise. Not only did they have some pretty good cakes and rolls, they also had a good gelato selection. Overall, I really enjoyed this buffet. I honestly could have paid twice as much and still be fairly satisfied. They also have beer and wine specials ($6 bottle of wine) for those who are interested. The only negative was our server seemed kind of upset the whole time, although she did occasionally refill our drinks and take our plates.",

    "text": "Since I stayed at The Orleans last weekend, I thought I would give this place a try. This is definitely one of the better casino buffets I've eaten at in Vegas, if not the best (I have to admit, the only buffets I've tried on the strip were at Excalibur's which was pretty bad and The Stardust which was terrible, the worst buffet I've ever had anywhere, even though that's a moot point now since it's no longer there. I also tried the much-hyped Carnival Buffet at The Rio a few years ago and thought for the money it was a rip-off).  The surroundings were nicer than average for a buffet and they had a tremendous variety of food. They have a deal for $21.00 in which you can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. I only had lunch there once ($8.00), but because of the huge variety of items, I'm sure it would be no problem to eat all three meals there and never have a single item twice if you didn't want to.   The quality of the food was above average for a buffet. There were a few things I tried I did not like, but there was more I liked than disliked. The beef back ribs, in fact, were by far the best I've had at any buffet and they had a braised oxtail stew which was very good, not as good as top quality homemade, but very good nevertheless, probably the single best item I've ever had at a buffet. The mashed potatoes, usually just fair or mediocre at most buffets, were also first rate.  The lines moved quickly and the service was good, although I couldn't understand why you couldn't just get your own water and napkins instead of having to get the attention of a server to do it for you. Also, there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the order or location of the various food stations, i.e. the ribs were two or three stations from the American food station whereas it seems more logical they should have been next to each other. That's a minor thing, though.  In terms of overall value for what you get this place is an easy four stars, although I could not quite bring myself to give it five due to the items I did not care for and most of the stuff just being decent. If I ever go to The Orleans again, though, which is quite likely, I will definitely go to this place again.",

Crawfish, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, egg rolls all bland, no flavor at all. Everything else didn't really look appetizing. The ribs were tough to eat. The Chinese ribs, too dry. Chicken gumbo was ok. They had Cajun style offerings like fried catfish and hush puppies, but it looked like it had been sitting there for too long, so I avoided it. The only thing that tasted great was their prime rib and mashed potatoes. Dessert selection was nice. They had gelato and sorbet as well as soft serve. Lots of cakes and pies, but didn't try. They have a chocolate fountain where you can dip fruit and cream puff in. Kids loved that part. Our meal was a decent value only for the prime rib. Our waiter Manny did a great job at taking care of us.",

Most days, there are prime rib that is decent. Succulent meat and taste is there. I also like eating their shrimp with cocktail sauce here. Unlike some other buffets in Vegas, the cocktail shrimp here taste fresh and have that good seafood taste. I do enjoy the simpler American side dishes here. Mac and cheese, baked beans, mashed potatoes, etc. Dessert is nice as well. They have a gelatin bar that they serve you and cheesecake is creamy with a good crust.   Don't bother with the Chinese food. Maybe I'm super critical because I'm Chinese, but that hot and sour soup is a joke -  taste nothing like it. Egg rolls inside is too soggy.  I give this 3 stars because for $15 and the lack of waiting in line, it's hard to beat in Vegas. As long as you enter knowing full well what you paid, you'll have a good time.",

The best section for me is the Cajun section with the smoked ribs and the beef ribs and the gumbo, its all pretty good.  I also actually thought their sushi was pretty descent for a buffet, I have ate sushi at probably about 50 buffets and I thought it actually tasted pretty good, it was a bit dry, but it was still fairly fresh and tasted like sushi, the problem I have with most buffet sushi is it just does not taste like Sushi, not even at Asian Buffet restaurants.   The sweet and sour pork was surprisingly good, the sauce was separate which was nice so the food was not at all soggy.  :) The craw fish is very tasty and well-cooked, love craw fish those alone are 5stars, and they also have a chocolate fountain, for dinner at least (can't remember if it's there for lunch too)!  Overall, for the price, I think it's pretty damn good.  I have been to a lot of Vegas Buffets and I would rate this higher than many of the buffets on the strip that cost 5-10 dollars more.  The staff was friendly, the food was pretty fresh considering they were pretty dead, and I nothing was poor quality, even if not all the dishes are exceptional, they are at least decent.

The staff was amazing in accommodating our large party  and Miss Peggy was our waitress and she was awesome! The Buffet itself left a little to be desired but I still got my money's worth. It's going to run you about $12/ per person for  breakfast, $15 per person for lunch, and $20/ per person for dinner . What I remember starting from the left to the right: Salad  bar with traditional items and pasta salads, soup bar with about 3-4 options, southern type food like black eyed peas and greens, Asian American food, sushi bar , omelette bar with breakfast items, rotisserie chicken, ham, roast beef, then enchiladas and a nacho bar and a taco bar, with traditional Mexican soups. Lastly was the  Italian section with vegetarian lasagna, pasta bar, ceased salad with house made dressing, and three types of pizza . Finally we have reached the  dessert  section that was home to three types of freshly baked cookies , about 10 flavors of gelato , individual mini dessert and cakes . Fountain drinks are included in your price with free refills so don't be afraid to quench your thrust! Plan to spend an hour and a half 2 hours dining at a pace that ensures getting your money's worth. In case you need to drop and reload midsession the restrooms are located right outside of the venue across the casino.",

I'd honestly rate the Luxor and Excalibur buffets a 1 - 2 stars. The food here is not the greatest compared to the strip buffets but it gets the job done.   What i liked about the buffet was the prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, and the crawfish (New Orleans Style). They also had different sections of food, like;  -American -Italian -Seafood  -Mexican -BBQ -Cooking Stations -Dessert   I would come back to save some extra money if I'm ever in town to save some money from the strip buffets and restaurants. Anything to save a buck from the tourist trap areas.",

The ribs were not eatable, they were so dried out I couldn't even chew it. The best part is the ice cream swirl. I wished this place was better. Circus Circus has one of the best buffets. Also our waiter Tony, no personality. I don't like when someone is talking to you without looking at you instead they look over your head. What happened to friendly staff that smile?",

After a dismal buffet at a pretentious  strip hotel, this buffet renewed my faith that there are still inexpensive finds in Vegas. I had the Sunday brunch buffet. It was a couple of bucks more than their normal breakfast, but the selections were phenomenal. Flat iron steaks cooked perfectly, pork onion gravy for the chicken fried steaks, gumbo, jumbalaya, ribs and more ribs. Crawfish! Every dish I tried felt the gave it special attention. Their gelato dessert area rivals the Rio. And for sunday brunch, there's a chocolate fountain and sparkling wine. Kudos Orleans! 4 stars to food, bumped to 5 for cost and service",

With your typical basic Salad Bars, Mexican, Chinese, Italian, American, BBQ n Seafood and also an above average dessert section with Cakes, Pies, Gelatos, Soft Cones n some French Finger Pastries. I believe Wicked Spoon n Studio B is still the reigning chanp of dessert decadence! But Orlean's French Market Buffet is still one of the few most value honest deal buffet in Las Vegas!

    "text": "Boy, was I surprised when I walked by and saw this completely remodeled buffet.  I've been staying at the Orleans for Vegas trips for the past 15 years.  I've had the old French Market Buffet more times than I can count and it has always been this drab depressing place with horrible food.  Well, all that has changed.  The Medley Buffet is all new and modernized!  I came for week day dinner and it was $18.99 with players club card.  They have extended the buffet line and there are so many more choices that look much more appetizing and inviting.  The food is overall much improved.  I really liked their smoked pork spare ribs, the braised oxtail, and the menudo.  The old New Orleans items are still there, so rest assured you can still get chicken and sausage gumbo as well as red beans and rice.  The gumbo seems less spicy than it used to be, but nothing a little Tabasco can't fix.  I also really liked the al pastor tacos with the meat actually being cut from the rotating spit.  They also serve crawfish, although when we went they were frozen crawfish from last season.  They were gigantic in size and tasted quite good for being frozen.  They were cooked well enough that you could still take the first ring off and pinch the tail to get the meat to come out all at once.  I hope as crawfish season picks up, they switch over to the live stuff.  It's happened in the past at French Market Buffet, so no reason it can't happen at the upgraded Medley Buffet.  Some items have not changed.  The hushpuppies and fried catfish are pretty dry.  The pizzas look anemic and greasy.  The desserts, while upgraded, are still stuff that's brought in instead of being made in-house.  The staff seem to have more of a spring in their steps and even the clientele seems upgraded.  No longer is this buffet just full of old locals eating for free after earning 200 points.  It felt like I was eating at M Resort.  With this new upgrade, Orleans leapfrogged many local buffets and even many strip buffets.  I'd say the order goes Bacchanal at Caesars, then Studio B at M Resort, then Medley Buffet in a tie with Feast Buffet at Red Rock, then Wynn, Bellagio, and the 3rd tier stuff at the Harrah's resorts.",

    "text": "Wow!  After the remodel of this buffet late last year, I give it a nudge to a 4 star rating!  Look, I realize these buffets in Vegas are par for the course...so I go with what the buffet is doing to improve themselves, to make it a better experience.  With the newly named Medley Buffet at The Orleans, they seem to have gone all-out with a total makeover!  The old buffet is unnoticeable - new walls, new stations, new decor, new seating, new carpet...new everything!  Their buffet was due for a nice change, and it seems to be all the better for visitors new & old to Vegas.  I think many would be pleased with its new looks!  I'm not really gonna complain about the food either!  No, it's not really competing with the likes of Bacchanal or Wynn or Cosmo when it comes to really high-end buffets...but it gives many of the local player buffets a run for their money!  We went on their most expensive meal night (Friday's Steak & Shrimp is $25.99 per person) and had many selections to eat:  -Prime Rib -Al Pastor Tacos -BBQ Beef Ribs -Shrimp & Pork Shumai -NY Steak -Assorted Meat & Cheese Platter -Kalbi Ribs -Fish & Chips -Crepes  Overall, mostly good!  Some of the items were on the overdone side, like the NY steak.  Some were not flavored the way I prefer, like the Kalbi ribs.  The BBQ beef ribs are tasty but they do tend to get stuck in your teeth & get very messy!  The crepes were not my favorite - batter is a bit too thick and more pancake like.  But I give them an A for effort on those.  The station selections were varied and there are more offerings than ever before.  Choices people, choices!  So while you may not like everything you try, there must be something you can agree with!  For me, the best selection they had that night was a HUGE pot of Oxtails they brought out!  We Asians know!  The minute I saw those glistening oxtails I knew I had something special.  Right after I got my large bowl (OK 3 large bowls), all my Asian peeps followed suit.  One little Chinese lady actually came to our table and asked exactly where those oxtails were on the service line!  Popular to say the least!  Great experience at the all-new Medley Buffet with my family!  Good eats with good company always makes for a good time!  Don't forget your FREE B Connected players card when you visit the buffet, discounts galore depending on your player level.    We'll be back Medley Buffet!",

    "text": "Came here at the suggestion of a friend for AYCE crawfish... secretly I'm a crawfish junky and after learning about this place, I don't think I'll ever go back to the Hot N' Juicy or Boiling Crab ever again!  The downside to it being a buffet is that they have to cater to the masses, so definitely no extra garlicky or extra spicy options available. However, find a willing cook and give them a tip and I'm sure you can get it flavored how you'd like.   Their crawfish looks like it was on steroids with how big they were and I had to stop after 3 huge piled high plates of just crawfish alone! My friends and I were THOSE people that would basically pile up a lot of crawfish on our plates to the point where other people behind is would give us the stink eye... excuse it, it's an AYCE, don't get your knickers in a twist, they will replenish it haha. I even had to give my friends the side eye and sh1t talking at the table because they emptied out the pan when they went before me haha.  Their barbecue station was amazing. The pork and beef ribs were fall of the bone tender.   Their made to order crepes were decent. I mean, yes they don't have the crepe pan to ensure it's a thin crepe, but the filling of fresh pineapple and blueberries made up for it.  Here's a tip: Tip your cooks who do a made to order anything in a buffet. Even a $1 is better than nothing. They were down to the last 2 crepes and the cook serviced me first because he knew I tipped him over the other person who was plain rude and didn't give them anything. It's kind of an unspoken rule seeing as you know, they're serving you something fresh and not just something in a pan that's been sitting in their warmer in the back.   Seeing as this trip was all about the crawfish, I didn't really try anything else. That'll be for the next visit. But definitely one of the better buffets in town that's off the strip.",

    "text": "Nicer than what it was, but not nearly as great as the strip buffets or my favorite local buffet, Studio B at the M Resort.  Not vegan friendly.  Barely vegetarian friendly. Meat lovers can find some tasty stuff here at the carving station and bbq area.  Foodies will not enjoy this spot.  Martha the server is great at her job   Talkative, amiable, efficient, considerate, no unnecessary conversation.  Recognize her.  She makes you money.  Give her days off, a raise and a promotion.  Service here is actually the highlight.  I enjoy being seated or the overall refills and customer satisfaction that they focus on here.  No bathroom inside but it's a casino, they want you to go to through the casino.  However, the nearest one is visible from.the buffet and fairly close.  Cups and mugs they use are all okay, nothing special.  Coffee is decent.  They offer the usual condiments and   Coffee could be better, fish was never great here.  The pollock and few other dishes they had were always dry and flavorless.  Chowmein, and breakfast items all tasted like microwave pantry products.  Kimchi was eh.  Mushrooms were okay.  Veggie spring roll was actually cool too.  The pho station and noodle station was kinda neat.  Yet, was still subpar.  The egg flower soup didnt have the right viscosity or thickness to it.  Tasted bland too.   The tables and tacos were decent.  Though they tasted like Latin food it was only okay.    Will do a more decent review in the near future.  For 15 bucks for lunch and your starving.  The place is aight.  But for that price you're better eating at Studio B Buffet with unlimited beer and wine with better food.",

We went for lunch, wait was very short & we were promptly seated. Our waitress was AMAZING! She was very helpful & was willing to bring us drinks from the bar.   Onto the food... The variety was outstanding! They had pho, bbq, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, pizza & breakfast food (I know the last 2 aren't ethnicities). I had the sushi, bbq & an omelette & all were really good! I'd highly recommend the kielbasa and prime rib. Their bbq sauces go really well with their ribs too!   My omelette (with everything) was awesome as well. Had that with some hash browns and was SUPER impressed. Sushi was pretty good too!   Dessert I had the bread pudding. It was really good!   Would I come here again? Absolutely! Was better than Red Rock's buffet and it wasn't even close!!",

Loved the tacos and the dessert wing and the unlimited orange juice! Just giving them 4 stars though because I didn't see any shrimp dishes or fried chicken - two items I always look for at any buffet place.  Amazing that they had a day pass for just $33.00!!!

Before today, we loved the Creole/Cajun offerings and especially the gumbo, snow crab and especially, the crawfish. Sadly, any reference to the name on the marquee has been thoroughly washed away. It's not as bad as Hometown Buffet (or worse yet, Golden Corral) but it's heading in that direction. You can definitely fill your pie hole, but it's pretty unremarkable, given the myriad of choices that abound in the Vegas area. On the bright side, the service was prompt, efficient and friendly. Sad.",

    "text": "Figured I had to hit the remodeled buffet before leaving Vegas.... Oh wait, I live here.. Prices are about where the near strip buffets run. Personally I wouldn't come back without another BOGO or better yet a free coupon.  To start it took forever to get in, line didn't move for 10-15 minutes and then would crawl for a dozen feet. We get to the register eventually after cranking the wheelchair through the chute. Name removed to protect is running the register, well I mean he is there. X loves his job so much he os dancing and bopping and spending little to no attention to his customers. MIL told him she was paying for two and points to herself and FIL that is on the wheelchair. I hear and I am twice as far from her as he is. We proceed to use the other register that opened up and complete our order and X is still working on MIL ticket.  There is a make your own Pho station. Can honestly say this is the first time I have seen that and hopefully the last. The water you are supposed to cook or reheat your noodles in is maybe luke warm, needs to be close to a boil of you plan on heating it up in less than 15 minutes.  Took a bowl of the gumbo since it came up in one of the many reviews I read while waiting. It was rather good, better than my cold Pho.  The Mexican section is pretty nice. Al pastor tacos were delish, wife thought they were too spicy. The elotes were okay, but you know how ow buffet corn on the cob is.  The Asian section was good, pork and shrimp shu mai were very flavorful and not dried out. The pork bun were good. The duck didn't have the duckiness of flavor I was hoping for. I skipped the sushi, I'll go to a sushi place for that.  Pork ribs were good, beef ribs were mostly fat. Has some steak that had some moisture left and tasted good.   They have a crepe station in the middle instead of with desserts, I didn't partake but my wife liked hers.   Blueberry cobbler is where I went even though I knew it was probably just pie filling.  Server was attentive and kept the table clear of dirty dishes and empty glasses.   So standard buffet with it's hits and misses",

First of all, the buffet was half empty and yet we had to wait 10-15 min in line to even pay and then another 10 min to be seated. Once we got in, we got no service at all once our initial drinks came. It seemed like the waiter had some type of issue with us even though we said nothing to him besides what we wanted to drink. Something was clearly wrong though because he never came back to our table, despite walking by a hundred times during our meal. He walked with his head up but whenever he got close to our table, he would look in the other direction as if to ignore us and continue serving the other tables around us. Is it a crime to be Asian now? WTF. This was very offensive and that's not even considering that we never got refills, napkins or service whatsoever.  The food isn't much better. Everything that I tried was either overcooked or bland except for the fried chicken wings and ice cream which ended up being most of what I ate. Healthy right? The entire Asian section was terrible and I was forced to waste an entire plate of food. How do you over cook broccoli beef or forget to season chow mein so that it tastes like nothing? I just don't get it. Worst buffet experience I've had in Vegas and I've been to some seedy and dirty looking buffets...Will not be back and would not recommend",

I would take the bus here from my resort, and then walk back to try and burn off some of the calories. it was so good I went twice.  Directions from the Las Vegas Strip at Tropicana. cross the street to the north side of of Tropicana. there you will find a bus stop. Take any bus going East, but there is usually only just one. get off one the Orleans is anounced.  Mike starting to get a Players Club card as this will give you one to two dollars off.  Directions to French Market is very well marked.  Once you pay and are stated the choices are unlimited. come prepared with what food styles you are looking for. the good stuff like the sea food and barbecue, it's at the far left. this is also where things get very exciting and tantalizing.  At least four different types of ribs in addition to a large carving station, with some of the largest portions of smoked brisket you can imagine. perfectly seasoned, with many rings of smoke, and a fatty bark if you request that. I always request fatty bark pieces. my serving was at least a half pound.  it's a good point to remember that it in a buffet like this, to take advantage of things that you don't normally get to eat so skip the salad bar and go for the expensive things like shrimp and grilled vegetables.  Shock and awe on the dessert station. the tiramisu was so good I went back for thirds.  but in addition there were several varieties of gelato as well as sugar free desserts.  Service was five-star five-diamond. but my diet Pepsi and my water never went empty and I did not have to ask. licked clean plates were whisked away unobtrusively when you would come back to the buffet. From the cashiers to the cleaning crew, everyone greeted you with a sincere smile and kind words.  What really stood out was the number of regulars and locals, that have a choice of hundreds of buffets. What keeps them coming back is the delicious food and service. and I do not have to reply on cheap gimmicks like the Cosmopolitan....stop putting food in different containers such as miniature skillets. this is nothing more than a gimmick to get you to eat less.  I would recommend French market to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

The food tastes good and there is plenty of variety:  omelettes, chocolate waffles, doughnuts, cereal, fruit, sausage, and much more.  If you come near the end of breakfast hours you can get the best of both worlds when they switch to lunch fare, including seafood, BBQ, Mongolian, and more.  My friends also loved the AYCE seafood dinner buffet -- the cost is a little bit more, maybe $15, but they quickly ate more than that in crab legs, mussels, clams, and shrimp.  Come early in the morning to avoid any lines.  This represents superior value compared to the Courtyard Cafe, which is also in the Orleans, though that Cafe is 24 hours.  There an entree plus drink could easily cost you $12 or more.",

And this time it wasn't the  exception.  So, I gave this place a try. They literally deserve 3 stars. Everything, including ambiance is MEH. Idk if we were here on a bad day but their employees  seem barely alive to say the least. They have a variety of food, which I gave everything a try and it wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. Definitely not recommending this place, unless you don't care much for your food.",

    "text": "Awful and over priced! We come to Vegas every year and we drive to the Orleans hotel and Casino for their amazing breakfast Buffet.  We arrived to the Buffet to find that it was closed and under construction. There was the other breakfast buffet inside the same hotel. It was 13 dollars per person which was more than we were used to paying at this type of venue but we were there and hungry so we gave it a shot. We were so disappointed. Firstly we were there at 9 am. Not anywhere close to lunch and there we more dinner food items then there were breakfast....crawfish, ribs and salad bar. Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with that except that there was no yogurt, fruit, grits,ect. The only bread they had was held in an area that you had to wait in line for an employee to make toast. Our 7 year old got pizza which looked and tastes like it sat for two days. We had to pay full price for a 7 year old which made the experience that much worse.   The wait staff brings you drinks. Ours was was not friendly and when she asked if We needed refills she didn't even wait for an answer and had already walked away.  Don't waste your money at this place.",

The customer service, particularly the front, I was not satisfied with. The woman who rung me up had an attitude the whole time. I asked her how the BOGO deal worked because my dad did not know, she rolled her eyes at him and ignored him. I had to ask another hostess.   The variety of choices of the buffet was amazing. They had USA, Asian, Mongolian, Seafood and Barbecue. The chefs were fast paced ensuring each tray was stocked. The quality was great as well. I'm very particular with how I like my barbecue, but none of the meats were too salty or underdone. I appreciated that.",

The place is a little run down, torn booths and sunk in. Took a while to get my drink, but the waitress was extremely attentive afterwards she explained she had a large party upstairs.  The Mexican food was meh, the taco shells weren't crunchy and it fell apart as I was about to take a bite. Ribs were excellent from the BBQ stand and Mac n cheese was yummy. Seafood was good except I hated the fact that I had to peel my shrimp.   Dessert station was good, I recommend the gelato and cream puffs.   I give four stars because of cleanliness, the dessert station was a mess and I seen a lot of different foods mixed with others.   I encountered a group of tourists with strong body odor (not the hotels fault) but it made me lose my appetite.",

The decor is absolutely beautiful and the colors that were chose were perfect. The food was organized perfectly as someone would order a meal. Salads,deli meat, cubes cheeses , fruit and bread all beautifully arranged in the far left corner with the food selection flowing into American BBQ,Chinese,Italian ect. The food was excellent. I usually don't eat everything I get on my plate from buffets as it's mostly trial and error but I finished everything I chose. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and was no where near dry. The pasta station was incredible. The El Pastor tacos were to die for. Dessert was was good, the normal ice cream and pies. The service was outstanding! Our server was very polite and our drinks were never empty. Out plates were taken as soon as we finished. I have to say I really enjoyed the new atmosphere and attitude that the entire place gives off. We will be visiting again soon :)",

    "text": "So finally after a couple of days of trying Indian breakfast at the strip, we get to try out this lavish buffet at the hotel where we stayed. This is located in The Orleans hotel which is a couple of miles away from the Vegas strip. Buffet starts around 9am and I am not sure when it ends. They have couple of options to try their buffet. One ticket or all day pass. We opted for one but if you're in there to gamble then get the all day pass so that you can hop in whenever you're hungry.   We tried breakfast and lunch buffet on different days. Weekend breakfast buffet had all the breakfast option that you could imagine. In addition to that they had some great barbecue food like ribs, smoked chicken, ham. Since this hotel is Orleans style so I wasn't surprised to see crawfish. Unfortunately, the only reason I gave one star less is because the crawfish was so bad that I had to spit it out immediately. That left a bad taste in my mouth that I had to rush to the restroom. I have had some amazing crawfish in New Orleans so my expectation is very high.   They also have live omelette section. There's no breakfast/brunch buffet without a good live omelette section. Various cuisines include Mexican, Italian, French, American, British, Asian and Jamaican.   Dessert section is really good. Ice creams, sorbets, cheese cakes, carrot cake. Service is great! Do tip the servers as they work very hard cleaning the table every time you get up to get another round of serving. If you're a fan of ice tea then ask for cranberry ice tea. It's really good.   Cost of a weekend brunch was $20 each and weekday lunch was around $15. Prices is pretty nominal. Restaurant is very clean.",

    "text": "We rolled in right before noon on a Saturday morning. The queue was set up like they expected a crowd, but we walked right up to the register, paid for two, and then were shown to a table right away.  They have quite the spread of items, ranging from fruit and salads to omelet and taco stations to carving stations and sushi. It was still breakfast time in my mind, but the second I spied the sushi, I knew that'd be my first stop.  The hubs and I did the obligatory walk-through, browsing the available food items, before splitting up to get our food. As mentioned, I went straight to the sushi station - grabbing 3 pieces of each of the options - and topping off with gyoza, a pile of noodles and a steamed bao.  I got back to the table before my husband (who had gone for breakfast foods - biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, and eggs). The best thing on my plate was the bao - it was perfectly steamed and soft, and the char siu inside was delightful. That was about the only thing I liked. The chow mein was cold, and the rice in the sushi was hard and crispy. In every piece from each roll! It was disgusting and inedible. The gyoza was okay, but over-steamed in my opinion, as the casings fell off when I tried to get it out of the tray.  Refusing to let that be the meal that stayed with me for the rest of the day, I headed back to the buffet for round 2, which was much better. I grabbed a biscuit and poured some gravy on top, then went and snagged a mini waffle, lathering that with whipped butter. I made one more pass, grabbing a couple bits of bacon, a smattering of hashbrowns and an Eggs Benedict in a bowl.  As I said, this round was much better. The biscuit was fluffy and the gravy was just a bit too salty (which I liked at that moment). The bacon was a little too limp, but edible. The hashbrowns were perfect (for me), but then I *did* seek out the bits that looked overcooked. The Benedict was surprisingly good - the egg was actually still perfectly poached and runny by the time I picked it up. The hubs went back for two more rounds after me, and really enjoyed the Chili Colorado and the mini taco station.   Our waitress was nice and friendly, as well. She even complimented me for my style. =)",

With the vast options of buffets in Vegas the Medley Buffet at the Orleans casino is a solid mid level buffet. But with the quality of food at most buffets (like the crappy mgm buffet) going down, and up in price makes this place stand out more.   For about 21 bucks they have a wide variety of good food. If you're a member of the B Connected players club you get a discount on your buffet depending on what level you are.

    "text": "4 stars in the Boyd Hotel Group of Buffets.  If you are a kama'aina, it's $5 with your dinner coupon so it's worth it.  There are more choices than any other Boyd properties.  Its way better than the Freemont Paradise Buffet and due to the higher ceilings, less smoke inhalation.  And that's a plus!  Nice selection of desserts.  The turkey and the ham are the best proteins.  The steak is okay, the prime rib is okay, the oxtail was a bit tough.  Loved the salad selections.  I skipped the seafood.  The shrimp scampi seemed the most popular tonight.    Loved the espresso  menu selections.  I made myself an affogado with a double shot espresso.  Which just made me so happy at the end.  The hot crepe is a great selection too.  This is an overall good buffet for anyone that won't cost you an arm and a leg.   Don't expect bone marrow or A5 here.",

Different stations, big salad bar, tons of deli meats cheese and fruits, pasta salads, chicken salads, seafood salads, DELICIOUS TENDER RIBS, all bbq and carving station items are amazing.   Asian station, Mexican station, Italian station, Classic American station.  Six or more soup selections including pho.   I saw people with huge plates of crawfish.   I usually never eat pizza at buffets but the PIZZA here was thick, fresh, and full of toppings.  DESSERTS are of great quality here. The lil round cheese cakes are so dense and decadent. The mango sorbet tastes just like frozen juicy sweet pure mango pulp heaven!   WAIT TIME/LINE: There was a rather big line. Took us about an hour to get seated but there is a lot of seating. Some area had tables free that hadn't been cleared maybe they had someone call out so I don't know if the wait is usual or just because of the call out because another day we came we walked right in.

I never had a chance to eat at the French Market Buffet, but I've heard Boyd did a decent job with the remodel. I don't go to buffets for the decorations, though, and Medley doesn't deliver on the food -- especially not during the weekend Champagne Brunch.   The breakfast options are good-not-great standard fare and the mimosas included with our meal came out to little more than a shot of liquid in a plastic cup. Our waiter promised us more mimosas after we'd finished our first round, but they never came.  The Pepsi barbecue sauce was great and the sushi was fine, but I don't go to brunch to eat sushi and I don't spend $20 on a buffet for a dipping sauce to be the highlight. Pass on the Medley Buffet. If you're Boyd-loyal and don't mind going out of the way, opt for Sam's Town's buffet instead.",

Its spacious and not cramped.  The food is decent.  There is a good selection of food from all over the world.  The desserts are minimal but delicious.  The gelato and cheesecake were surprizingly good.  I also enjoyed the ice cream sandwhich.  Its a bit pricey when considering the offerings but if you like crawfish, this is the place to be on Friday Night.  The peel and eat shrimp was a bit on the smalle  The Mexican Station was really tasty.    Their Mexican Style Street corn and tacos were on point.  I went back for more.  Service was excellent and the plce was clean.  I'll be back again when at the Orleans.",

My family was visiting for a get-together and birthday celebration. Cashier yelled at us in front of customers \"Hey, you have to pay first\", when we've already paid with tips earlier. Hostess, on the other hand, arrogantly  insisted on splitting our party into two tables under two wait staff Manny (3 adults+ baby) and Tiffany (2 adults) instead of trying to accommodate our request to seat our party altogether in one table, reasoning that it would move the service from Manny to Tiffany, when their proposed seating already does that. Celebrations are special.  Splitting our party defeats togetherness. Rude, boorish approach leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.   Uncouth, ill-mannered, strangely arrogant. Need to polish on courtesy, kindness, hospitality. After all, this is the hospitality business.",

Breakfast and weekday buffet prices are quite a bit lower.   For the price, it was a good meal. Plenty of options, steak, ribs, peel n eat shrimp, shrimp salad, shrimp scampi, etc (every option you can think like Bubba says in Forrest Gump). They also have sushi, Asian, Mexican, pasta, salad, desserts, ice cream and more.   The entire buffet was clean, both around the food and the tables. Waitstaff was friendly and present.

Never has it been an issue where they only give one of us the discount but today the sassy grouch at the counter wanted my husbands card too. Oh well it's just $1. So we are seated at a table with no place settings and a bowl with one coffee creamer. I was waiting for a family to return to their table as if it was in use. the waitress comes and gets us silverware. She takes our order. Me: coffee and a water, him: champagne and an orange juice. She rolled her effin eyes at him! Really Zoraya? Is his order  really going to ruin your day with your busy section of 4 tables? She didn't even refill our drinks.

There are smoked salmon, primed ribs, crab cakes, breakfast foods (i.e. blintz, pancakes, waffles, and bacon), an Asian food station (i.e. Kung Pao chicken), cheeses, a Mexican food station (with churros!), an omlette station, some crab legs, shrimp, veggies and fruits, and finally, dessert. Overall, the food tastes great. I love it. The only things I do not like are: 1) the tiny, cheap, plastic champagne glasses and 2) the infrequency of waiters/waitresses coming around asking if we were okay or if we needed anything. I waited forever to ask for more coffee or champagne. I wish there were more waiters or waitresses going around. And they also take a while to take our plates. But I am willing to look over these things because my tummy is nice and full because of French Market Buffet. And yes, I am willing to go there again.",

    "text": "this is one of the \"to go\" buffet when I visit LV.  honey love their desert, especially pecan pie.  I love their craf fish and filled my plate with shrimp.  sometimes, their green chile pork stew or shredded beef for taco are really delicious.  I only go there for lunch which ends at 3pm, you can eat till 4pm before they removed everything and shifted it to dinner. with their player's card, it's only $7.99 for lunch.  No boby can beat the price for the variety of food you can get.  yes, when I went Wed lunch, they do have beef ribs, beef brisket, roast chicken at the craving table.  I mean for that price, it's much better than hometown buffet which is the only choice I have at home. not all the food taste great, just need to find what you like.  egg rolls are always fresh and crisp, they do have the mogolian dish, I never have a chance or room for that, eat too much shrimp.... anyway, as long as you set your expectation correctly, you will be happy.",

No I can't believe it passes the state requirements.  None of the hot food was hot.  All the food was bland.  The hubby loves the Mexican food at most buffets but everything here he said was cold and tasteless.  We had a buy one get one deal so at least it only cost us half to be so disappointed. We will not be returning to this Boyd establishment.",

    "text": "I really wanted to try a buffet while in Vegas. It was New Year's Eve, so we wanted to avoid the madness of the strip until that night. We were staying fairly close to the Orleans Casino and decided to give this place a try. Many buffets off-strip didn't seem to have great reviews, and this place seemed decent while remaining reasonable priced. I don't want to spend tons of money, as I can't eat enough to properly take advantage of a buffet.  We were quite happy with the offerings at this buffet. After paying, we were seated at a table and received excellent service for drink refills and bussing. I started with some BBQ, trying the pork links, biscuit and gravy, and jerk chicken. I also tried some french fries and fish filet from the seafood section. From an American food section, I had mac and cheese. From the Asian section, I had sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, egg rolls, and lo mein. I also had a salad from the salad bar and gelato, a mini pecan pie, and a mini piece of chocolate cake for dessert. There was another Asian-inspired section and a Mexican section as well, although I didn't try those.  I liked everything that I had, with the exception of the mac and cheese. It was dry and flavorless, although others in my group seemed to like it. The biscuit for the biscuit and gravy was extremely dry, but the gravy softened it, in addition to being tasty. The Asian foods were typical, Americanized offerings but had good flavor. Everything available looked appetizing, even if it wasn't my cup of tea. The salad bar was small, but I enjoyed the balsamic vinegarette and the topping options. The balsamic and oil and vinegar were the only dressing options that weren't a fattier, mayo-based option.  I wish I could have eaten more, but there was simply wasn't enough time for us to linger to have more helpings. If you're in the area and looking for a good buffet, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "Let's be honest here. This is not Caesars Palace but that doesn't mean that it's not a good buffet for the venue you're eating it at.  To start with, understand that this is actually owned by a corporation that owns several different casinos here in town most of them called Coast. For example Gold Coast, Suncoast.  Which means you're going to get simular quality at all of these buffets but the Orleans is actually slightly above the cut of the others.  I'm only going to be talking about the seafood night, because if you pay a few dollars more it's the only night that it makes sense to go.  So, Friday nights are Seafood night. Typically in Las Vegas this is the night that most of the hotels put out Seafood.  It makes sense doesn't it? People get paid on Fridays, Seafood is consumed when people get paid and have extra money, unlike the strip hotels which can jack their prices up and put the food out every day of the week this is how the local hotels and casinos operate for seafood.  Okay, so what are you getting here?  Well, in addition to the regular fare, you're also getting snow crap period The Orleans snow crab is pretty decent. It's not skinny and small and actually quite large compared to other hotels here in town.  It comes served cold but you can also take it over to the Mongolian cooking station and have it heated up for you with different spices which is something that no one else offers.  Word of warning though, if you're like me and you can't eat seafood then you should probably avoid the Mongolian station all together. They literally cross contaminate like crazy which is the only reason I can't give the early and so True 5 star review.  Everything else at the buffet is actually quite good. The food is fresh and turned over on a regular basis.  The dessert bar is actually great they have gelato and lots of different desserts for anybody's tastes. Make room for dessert when you go to this one.  I can only assume that the rest of the week is just like Friday nights but just without Seafood with the exception of shrimp. I highly recommend the Orleans versus the other local hotels here in Las Vegas because the quality is pretty darn good the wait times are low and the service is great.",

    "text": "The renovation looks good but the food is awful. If you're looking for bad food and bad service in a good looking buffet, this place will work for you.   I went to the renovated buffet the week they opened. While the food was disappointing, there were a few items that were edible and I thought it showed promise. I went back today and I could barely find anything worth eating.  Anything that cost more than a few pennies to slop up was removed since their grand opening.   They raised prices but lowered their food quality with the reopening.  In just a week food quality has fallen dramatically. If they keep this up they will just be serving ten versions of potatoes and twenty variations of cabbage  and some rice with nothing else soon. Instead of crispy fried chicken they had frozen pre-fried chicken wings which were cold, soggy and disgusting. Instead of a rich oxtail stew they had dried out \"roasted\" sweet potatoes. The clams and mussels were replaced with shells that were pretty much devoid of anything else. Their BBQ ribs were so over cooked and dry they were worse than jerky.    Service was terrible as well. Waitress was very nice but she could not keep up with all her tables and our dishes were piled high and sitting there throughout the meal.   It's such bad management to invest so much money and effort into creating a gorgeous new buffet only to ruin it by basically serving reheated the cheapest frozen foods out of some deep discount food warehouse.  I was really looking forward to this new buffet and utterly disappointed.  My review may be a bit harsh and overly critical but Ii really want management to fix this buffet.  There is so much potential to have a destination worthy buffet at the Orleans.   I hope management rethinks their strategy and decides they should do better ... it's hard to do worse.",

    "text": "This review is for the Friday night seafood buffet.  $31.99 for subpar food.  Before the renovation, the price was cheaper and the food was so much better.  King crab was also on the seafood buffet, but not anymore.  The crab legs were so skinny like the Chinese food buffet and the meat did not come out in 1-piece.  No matter what you did, the meat kept breaking apart and stuck in the shell.  The oysters had quite a bit of shell in the meat.  Luckily the crawfish was huge and the dungenous crab was pretty good.    Prime rib was non existent but roast beef was on the menu.  When the prime rib did come out, it looked very dry and unappealing.  Everything else was just \"average.\"  If you are charging $31.99 premium price for a seafood buffet dinner, the food better be up to par with the price that is charged.  Unfortunately, you are paying for their renovations with a lower quality food product than when it was the French Market Buffet.  Sadly I uses to love this buffet, but now I will never frequent this place as the quality has gone downhill.  The breakfast buffet is just as bad.  Please make the necessary changes if you want to charge strip buffet prices.",

It is not french food, but a mixture of Mexican, Chinese, Italian, & American.  Lots to choose from!  They have the BEST fried chicken.  It was crispy and juicy!!  I want more!!  They also had like 4 other types of chicken items.  Lots of variety to choose from.  The service is really a hit or miss, but during this last visit......... It was a HIT.  The server was super fast, nice, and attentive.  Every time we were done with our dishes he was there to clean it up.  He came by offering refills without us having to flag him down.  He was great. I even over tipped him.  We went on Saturday during Memorial Day weekend.  They did not increase the price to Holiday pricing, which was nice.  It was still $10.99 for lunch.  If you have a players card you, +1 guest are $1 off each.  $9.99 for a HUGE buffet selection is not bad at all!  HAPPY OVEREATING!!",

Their saving grace was that their steak was cooked pretty well but was bland and they had no A1 and the sauces they did have were disgusting.

Each section has a different theme to it so you can pick and choose what you're feeling. Big dessert and salad islands in the middle, but nothing special about the desserts, just your standard selection. Service is good, they're attentive with clearing plates and getting refills.

The line was not that long and the guy working the desk allowed us to go get a Players card and come back to the front of the line.  You get a dollar off just cause you have a players card.  The Sunday Brunch was from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm and it was only $16.99.  Free Champagne was Served to Guests throughout the meal.  The Buffet restaurant was packed and the price was worth every PENNY!  On the buffet line going from right to left he French Market Buffet had many different dishes to choose from.  I had to get two dishes, a plate of meat like i was on the atkins diet and one plate of everything else. They had Italian, Mongolian, Barbecue, American, Seafood, Mexican and Chinese food as well as an huge dessert bar with plenty of desserts to choose from.  They had some delicious bbq pork ribs and yummy smoked ribs.  The Smoked Ribs to me was the highlight of the meal.  The bacon was nice and crispy.   My lady had sushi and she hit the huge salad bar that they offered.  She also got her some sushi which she truly enjoyed.  Overall, One of the best buffets I have ever been too. I would have gave them a five.  My only complaint was that the Crawfish and jambalaya that they offered didn't taste like back home.  Need a little bit more salt but I will Definitely be visiting this casino and its buffet again in the future.",

Over the years have tried many Vegas Buffets..Aria, MGM, Mirage (when it was Great b4 Cravings) Bellagio, Caesar Palace on and on!  But we never leave Vegas without eating here. Sunday February 12th we tried their Sunday Brunch! OMG delicious! I never made it to the pancakes I came for! But the made to order Omelet and the Hush puppy Fried Shrimp were Ridiculously Fantastic....should have eaten more of them!",

Just that, I felt as if I was visiting my grandparents in their assisted-living home's restaurant.    The lasagna tasted like the best Chef Boy-Ar-Dee's I've ever had.    The cheese enchiladas were great until you tried the second one and realized that it's almost all sauce and the enchilada themselves have no True shape.  Rather, it's just a coagulated gelatinous glob of cheese and something that tries to be a sauce of some sort.    The shrimp are small and have all of their little shrimp feet intact.  If you enjoy using your napkin to often wipe the taste of the sad misery of the ocean floor off your fingers, this place is for you.  The top portion of the bread pudding tastes like bread pudding.  About a half inch down, though, it turns to jelly.  Jelly fused with a raisin or two.  Be sure to add lots of the vanilla sauce to mask the True flavor of this delicacy.  All of this for nearly $40.    Next time, I'll just skip a meal and weep quietly in darkness - that actually sounds like it might leave a better taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "French Market Buffet is located in The Orleans Casino Hotel. I had the Saturday Champagne Brunch for approx. $10/person. (There is a $1 discount if you have their player's card.) After seating me, the waitress promptly took my drink order.  You can order champagne from the waitress but I chose not to drink the champagne.    Buffet food selection: French Market Buffet offers a selection of food ranging from American to Asian.  As expected, the selection is not as grand as buffets located on the Strip; however, there was a good variety of food for the price paid.  The food was reasonably tasty.  There is also an omelet bar (my fav!) where one can order an omelet with ingredients that include ham, sausages, bacon, cheese, green peppers, mushrooms, etc.  My omelet was delectable!  Desserts: The coconut macaroons and chocolate cake was super delicious.  The waitress refilled my drink without me asking.  The facility was clean and well-kept.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will return mainly for the price.",

The food was not hot - the desserts looked much better than they tasted.  We went as a family with 4 kids and 2 adults $103 for dinner...  We arrived at 3:05 PM, we were told it was too late for lunch, and were told they closed from 3-4PM (for dinner transition).  They would not let us in even though we did not care about dinner...  We ended up waiting it out at the bowling alley (non smoking area) and then came down at 4 PM and waited in line for 25 minutes!  When we finally got to eat we were very disappointed.  This place is much worse than our local casino back home at Tulalip!  Kids are FULL PRICE!  Food selection is well below average for a casino in Vegas, food quality was below average for Vegas...  I will not be back!  Very disappointed - I went there based on all of these reviews, sad I can't share the same positive feedback.  This place is only one step above old country buffet...  Save your money - eat elsewhere for dinner.",

This one has a fantastic selection at a reasonable price: italian, mexican, asian, cajun, fried things, meat stuff, soups, salad, and an especially impressive dessert variety: ice cream, cakes, pies, danishes, all kinds of stuff! I went at breakfast, so they had breakfast things too like waffles, omeletes, and pancakes. The dishes were hit or miss quality wise, as generally to be expected at a buffet, but the majority of it was quite good, and the beauty of a buffet is that you can try all kinds of stuff and eat more of what you like! I think my favorite dishes were the shrimp/cheese enchilada, churros, mashed potatoes, crabcakes, and apple crumble. And convenient if you're staying in the hotel!",

For example, the breakfast fruit (cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon) will turn into a fruit salad for the dinner menu.  The menu offerings do not vary day after day.   Shrimp cocktail and crawdads are very popular as people take them by the platefuls back to their seats.  Most of the items I had were slightly warm at best, including the soups.   There are 2 salad bars that have different toppings and salad dressings.  The soups are the same on both sides though.    Best part of the meal is the gelato bar for lunch/dinner.  They offer about 8 different varieties including: mango, mint chocolate chip, lemon, raspberry , caramel, white chocolate, vanilla, etc...  Slightly disappointed that this place lacks any FRENCH food.  (French salad dressing doesn't count!)  After all, this is the French Market buffet, a crepe station or hot/fresh benets would be nice.",

    "text": "While working I was talking to a bus driver who I will call \"JOE\"( because THATS HIS NAME!!) & we were talking \"Buffets\" & he said I had to try this one. So to show what truly nice people I have encountered thus far in Las Vegas, Joe not only makes a recommendation to this place, BUT gives me a $4 off coupon & meets me on Tropicana Ave to give it to me and drives me there with his wife & daughter as they were on their way to run errands. HOW COOL IS THAT?? (Answer: VERY!!)   So I ended up paying $5 and change for this AWESOME Buffet using the coupon. And let me tell you now THIS PLACE IS HUGE!! The entire dining area has to be as big as a basketball court if not bigger. And for the size and the crowd on hand, it was a very nice and orderly atmosphere, well lit and pleasantly quiet with no crying babies and no standing up \"Peekers\" looking over the back of the booth I was sitting in. (I like to feed them string beans!!)  I asked to be seated in a booth and was gladly told to sit wherever I wanted. There are several stations = BBQ, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and a HUGE island of deserts.  I made a good attempt to try as many items from as many stations as I could and ended up liking the Chinese station the best that had spring noodles mixed wt vegetables & Beef  that was really fresh and good.  Joe had really pushed the BBQ Beef ribs saying they were the best but the selection the day I went had ALOT of fat on them and I had to pick at them to take it off. And while I'm complaining I might add that the onion rings, fried fish & chicken fried steak had ALOT of breading on them that had me picking at it as well. Other than that though I really cant complain and have to give this place 2 thumbs up.  The Mexican station was extremely good with beef tacos and all the toppings and a spicy shredded chicken that made nice tacos as well. There were other selections such as enchaladas etc and it all looked very good.  The Italian station had speghetti, lasagna, pizza that all looked really good too. I have a sliver of a slice and it was very good and crispy and I tried a couple pcs of eggplant parmesean and it was off the hook good .  There was also peel n eat shrimp wt tartar & cocktail sauce as well as crawfish which looked good and I had one and still cannot see what the draw to these things are as its alot of work for very little pay-off in the way of meat. I chose to stick wt the shrimp & mixed them in wt my Chinese noodles mix & sliced open a couple spring rolls and put them inside. I always \"shrimp out\" my spring rolls!!  The aforementioned Desert Island had a little of everything = soft serve ice cream, strawberry & whipped cream toppings, scooped Ice Cream, Gellato, Pies, Cakes, Cheesecake, & cobblers. I tried the Coconut Cream Pie and the filling was off the hook (I had 2 pcs and had to stop myself from getting more!!) but the crust was soft and mushy-like and not to my liking at all and I didnt eat it. I also tried some soft serve Vanilla Ice cream  wt whipped cream and the taste of the shortening in the whipped cream came through and more cream & sugar was needed.  The waitstaff seemed nice enough but my Ice Water was'nt refilled, nor was I asked if I needed a refill. I didn,t so it wasnt really a big deal. The girl taking the plates off the table seemed to be working the hardest and I felt bad for her and took my plates up myself several times. I also hid a dollar under my dish within a dish so she would find it and not the waiter as she deserved it more than the waiters did.  Overall I have to recommend this buffet not only for the wide variety and selection, but the quality and good food offered. I only paid $5, but had I paid full price it would have still been worth it.",

    "text": "3.4  I've had better food and the same quality of food for way more money in Vegas buffets.  What this place supplies is reasonable food at a price point less than many of the other buffets around.  I went for their steak and crab Wednesday, $15,99 less a dollar discount for being a guest at the hotel.  The crab legs were spindly and the steak was a bit tough but cooked to the medium I asked for.  The swordfish wasn't bad and I noticed several folks with whole plates of crawfish.  Many of the folks seemed to be locals and although I had no wait at 5:00 by the time I was done the place was full and a long line had formed.  They do not rush the diners in the restaurant.  There were plenty of food choices.  I gave up after 4 plates, the last of which was desert.  Because of the number of people everything I tried was still hot or cold as needed.  The vanilla soft serve had given up so I had chocolate ice cream with my peach cobbler.  The service was really quick and I noticed those folks requiring bar service got their drinks quickly.  My one big complaint was my plates got cleared while I was getting another and my service, complete with whatever was on them, was set on the table rather than waiting for me to get back and transfer them to my new plate so I would get a separate plate to put them on on the first trip.    For the price this was an excellent value.",

I did not have a Orleans Club Card, but $8 is a deal. The Sahara Hotel has $8.99 Buffet with a Card, but with the Orleans, you probably would save $1 or $2. I remember my total was around $16. Very Good Deal!!  They had Salad, Mexican or Tex-Mex Station, Chinese Station, American, Italian, and their own big Dessert Station. I mainly went to American Station since I always fall in love with Mac N Cheese. I had sandwiches, and bunch of other Americana stuff. They had a lot of food, but I only had three plates. Like my headline says...I am a Big Guy, but I don't eat a lot.  Orleans is away from the strip, but somewhat is small scaled version of the Rio. Orleans has their French Market Buffet and Rio has their World Buffet. If you are on a budget and not wait a long line...go to the Orleans. Its pretty cheap for lunch without a Club Card and food is better than the Sahara Buffet and probably as close to the Rio Buffet without the high price.   Lunch Ends around 3:30pm. Not sure what time Dinner starts during the weekdays. Very reasonable and not too crowded, but the food is very good and not seem too be mass-produced.  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",

Guess the prices have recently been raised, with my club card, it still cost me $16.50.  Prime rib was dry (I tried it 2 or 3 times--the au jus didn't help...recovering from over eating while I type this), the rest of the selections were truly average and unremarkable.  Compared to other LAS buffets on a Monday night, there are much better (a) values and (b) quality to be had.  Very disappointed, unlikely I'll return to the Orleans feeding frenzy in the future.  Didn't use to be like this...",

This buffet is economy in mon-sat like 13$ per person and has good spread of dishes to try.  Try it.",

Not really a BBQ buffet as claimed but they did have a good variety of different ribs and some sausage. But no other True BBQ meats. For example when I think of BBQ I think of brisket, pulled pork, BBQ hot link, Yams, Sweet tea and banana pudding. Which they had none of.  I was actually happily surprised by the Craw fish they were huge. The rest of the buffet was just OK and As far as desserts they were terrible very cheap and very little quality.",

My guest had eggs Benedict and granola and fruit-- didn't like the fruit or the terrible tasting Benedict. The bacon was very salty. The ham was a little salty, and the eggs were just ok. Service was ok. I will probably go back for dinner sometime. But the breakfast is not the best. I remember it being better, but not this day.

There's a free shuttle that takes off from Bill's Gamblin' Hall and brings you to Orleans.  It runs every 15 min from 9am to midnight.    The food is good!  I recommend going straight for the crawfish and beef ribs.  They are the \"signature\" items!  The crawfish is boiled in a cajun style broth has great flavor without being too spicy.  The beef is super tender and well seasoned.  The good thing is that because these are very popular items, they're constantly being replenished.  Aside from these two items, everything else was okay.  I sampled the gumbo, mushroom stir fry, and a few of their desserts.  All were good, but I spent most of my time eating crawfish!  At $7.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner, this place is one of the best buffet values I've seen.  I will definitely be a returning customer!",

We were seated and greeted by Nena who took our drink order and we were on our way. Alot of good looking options, 2 omlet bars and a carving station for ham, meatloaf and sausage. Most of the food I tried was great and tasted fresh. I tried the cheese blintsz, a mini waffle, pancake, 3 different sausages, bacon and french toast and I cleaned my plates. I went back an tried their mexican bar, I had a taco some refried beans, a few tornados, guac, chilaquiles and a basket of chips. This is where that one star faded away. The food from the mexican bar had no defining flavors, nothing memorable, everything in a way tasted the same. The sauces were tame and didn't highlight any tastes in any of the foods. The chips in the baskets were chewy. The service was phenomenal and the majority of the food was fresh tasting and great. Try it out you're bound to find something you like with so many choices.",

My friend and I ate different foods at the buffet, none of which seemed to have any flavor.  The NY strip steak was tough, the tacos were sitting under heating lamps and the sauce had soaked through the corn tortillas, the desserts lacked flavor, etc.  Within an hour of getting back to our hotel rooms, we were both sick and actually up all night.  Since we both ate different foods, I can't exactly say what it was.  Basically, I paid $50 for two people to get sick on vacation.  Please don't say I didn't warn you.",

NO CATFISH!!!  They offered planks of pollock that looked AND tasted like they came out of a box of a GENERIC brand of frozen fish!!!",

This buffet runs $21 p/p & $32 p/p on Sunday's. John said it must be good. Let's try it. This buffet represented all ethnic cuisines. I know the stations took up a 1/2 mile. Not making this up. Full Salad Bar, Asian, Hawaiian, Italian, Mexican, American, Japanese and so forth. All had a menu option. The dessert bar was topped with fresh baked cookies, pies, cake slices and ice cream. I can see why they charge so much. The servers were attentive and helpful. They asked us about our stay and genuinely wanted to wait on us.  We will visit again soon.",

    "text": "4 stars for great value in terms of price vs quality and selection among near-strip buffets. Removing one star for making me poop longer than usual. But adding a star for nice decor. Removing another star for making me look fat. I'd also subtract couple stars for putting me into food comma for 2 hours, which makes this place a little more expensive as time is money. But the overall experience was very good and I'm giving it 5 stars to negate older reviews posted before remodeling, as this place now deserves much better rating. Anyway, I wasn't aware of the recent remodeling and was nicely surprised when visiting for Christmas Day dinner.  I usually don't care for expensive remodels that are often used to increase the price, but in this case it worked somewhat well and the Orleans buffet now deserves the place among the top buffets in Vegas, even though still far from perfect. There are no crab legs (except Friday nights) and therefore this buffet cannot be compared to the best ones that do serve them. Yet, the price reflects the lack of crab legs and justifies rating this location among the top of those that do not have them. The food quality and selection makes this place among the top 5 in Vegas on my list, little behind Bacchanal, M, and Wicked Spoon, while beating all of them on price. I was especially surprised with ribs, which were better than those served in many restaurants. They had good selection of other meats, although some could've been added only for Christmas. Green beans, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables were fresh and cooked well. Lots of other selections from various cuisines, at least during Christmas Day. Some things that I would like to see added would be mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. Desert selection not as amazing as top buffets but still along better ones in Vegas. The holiday price was the same as the regular price during nights and weekends ($19 with rewards card), therefore I'm assuming that the selection and quality may be similar every day. Nice decor and friendly waiter further helped providing great experience.",

Standing outside the entrance - the remodeled buffet looks very nice and classy - quite a change from the old French Market Buffet. The name has also changed to the Medley Buffet. The buffet now has several cooking stations with much improved food ! The buffet was just OK before - now it's definitely gone up a notch ! Everything we had was very tasty and their selection was significantly improved ! I would now recommend the newly remodeled Medley Buffet at the Orleans !",

There was a huge variety of food from many different cultures , I was impressed by the many many carving stations and live action cooking stations , such as create your own pho, the made to order crepes and tacos !! The Chile verde is the bomb and if I get comps again heading here for that alone , it was that good !! Actually many of their pork dishes were great !! Also for the gluten free crowd the table menus give you a play by play of your gluten free options , I did post a pic !! All in all we left with a full belly and a happy disposition !!

We figured it would be enough time, so we went ahead and stayed, even though we did feel rushed. Really, there's no reason for a buffet of this caliber to be closing from 3:00-4:00 to get ready for dinner. I've been there at dinnertime, and the food is not that different. But my problem was this: we didn't realize that we would be getting a sparse choice of food: dried out meat, overcooked vegetables, etc. It was super disappointing. I finally got to the dessert station before it closed (I was on a timeline and thought it would be closed by the time I ate my entree-- felt so rushed). There was exactly one piece of pie on a plate: ridiculous! The dessert case was not at all full-- it seemed like I would have to ask for anything, versus just taking a plate. I felt really cheated by this buffet overall. If they were giving some sort of discount for going the last hour, I would understand it.........but we were paying full price and getting very little for the money ($16 each basically, which is rather high for the quality of the buffet). We live in Las Vegas and go to lots of buffets, so I have much to compare with. This buffet, though beautiful since its remodel, is not a great buffet. I didn't care for much of anything that I took, food-wise. The beef brisket was super dried out and tough, I didn't find any meat in my pork tamale, etc.-- just very ordinary food. The fruit was good, but a plate of fruit does not translate to $16 for me. I seriously doubt I'll be going back. This is the third chance I've given them since the remodel, and it's been sub-par every time. Any Station casino's buffet is better than this one, and so much cheaper.",

The beef ribs is not tender at all, the meat was hard which means they need to cook it longer so the meat is much tender.  I gave 3 star because they have many other choices of foods and service from Victoria was great.",

We had menudo, eggs,sausage, bacon, potatoes,pancakes, waffles and bottomless mimosas! Awesome!! But unfortunately dinner was not as good. So to be fair I'd have to say four stars is good. We bought the all day pass and got our moneys worth but will probably not do that again. Breakfast bomb! Dinner jus ok.",

I come to casino buffets quite often (3-6 times a month) I decided to go to the medley buffet because I received a coupon for buy one dinner get one free buffet in the mail and the food was subpar and service was trash. Most definitely not like any other buffet ive had, after getting full I decided to have desert but when looking at the spoons there were literally food on every single one. Multiple people were scavenging through the spoon container to find one clean utensil. I thought I found one in a new set of utensils they brought out but when putting the spoon in my mouth I felt DRIED UP FOOD in my mouth. I asked for a manager and she handled it by removing the utensils and placing plastic utensils. They need to have a person Inspecting all dinnerware.",

The line was super long and the wait was about 30 minutes. Not too bad considering this is their most popular night.   The crab and oysters were fresh and plentiful. The food in general is decent. We like to make our own dipping sauce for the crab and bring it since we don't care much for the butter they provide. We basically stack a mountain of crab on a plate and start cracking away. We tried a few other like the spare ribs, smoked sausage, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and clam chowder as side helpings to the crab. Nothing stands except for the service which is always attentive and professional.",

Regular price is 21.99. The b connected card applies for 2 guests so since there were 3 of us 2 of us ate for $16.99 and the third person was $21.99. Asked for a high chair for my toddler (didn't have to pay for) they brought a highchair that was filthy with old food glued to it. So disgusting. Requested another highchair which was clean. Food: was OK I was disappointed but my husband enjoyed it.  A lot of variety especially in the desserts section it was overwhelming but out of the 4 desserts that we sampled the pecan bar was the best. Overall food lacked flavor not worth the $ go elsewhere.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not as convenient to get to.  $17.99 for champagne Sunday Brunch (without player's card) and they did not mess around with the champagne. They basically just poured the entire contents of the bottle into our drink glasses (and it was just two of us). The servers were very attentive and fun.   The buffet itself: heaven  Made to order omelet station-delicious with plenty of options.  Seafood! Delicious baked clams, sushi, lox for bagels, calamari, and plenty if other options I did not even try (including crawfish which I thought I would try but instead became our table mascot).  Plenty of fresh fruit and cereals including oatmeal and grits.   The rotisserie chicken melted in my mouth and had I not filled up on everything, else the honey glazed ham looked amazing.   Dessert selection: wow. So many cookies, pastries, pies, and cakes to choose from, but I had to have the chocolate fountain.   If I could have stayed for more time (and had a bigger stomach), I think I would have tried everything in the Mexican and Italian sections because everything looked delicious.   Keep in mind that I have never been to another Buffet in Vegas, so perhaps there are better ones out there, however I know where I am going the next time I am in Vegas.",

They have a BBQ area, stir fry and make your own pasta stations, a Mexican food area and pizza and pastas. Oh and then there's dessert. I think they may actually have more dessert than food options. Soft serve, cakes and pies, gelato and sorbets and my dad's favorite: the bread pudding.   I enjoyed the breakfast buffet with the omelet station and crisp bacon!    The waitstaff that brought your beverages and took away your dirty plates were really nice and prompt with our drinks.   I had to minus a star because of the cashiers. On one occasion the cashier was rude and charged us incorrectly even after we told her numerous times how many people were in our party. She was downright sassy commenting on other people being served near us \"oh there's another one, must a full mood out tonight\".",

Each station has a wide variety of its particular cuisine. The food is great, the price is right and the staff is very personable. Your meal is discounted, when you use the hotel's B-connected card. They also offer a three meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner) pass at a discounted price. I highly recommend The Orleans Hotel buffet!",

VARIETY:  The variety of food available is very diverse. Great for picky eaters, I guess, because of range of food is almost ridiculous! Dinner buffet was my fave; breakfast was a close second.   Here's a general idea of the dinner spread: -Fresh and cooked seafood: crab, shrimp, clams, crawfish, sushi, you name it. -Chinese: stir fry station, noodles, spring rolls, etc. -American: ribs, steak, etc. -Mexican: burritos and such -Several different pastas -Soup -Salad bar  -Dessert bar with a gelato case!  SWEETS:  The desert bar/station will satisfy any sweeth tooth!  Diabetic and all!  I'm so happy to say that they have a whole sugar-free dessert section for all you health nuts and diabetics.  I like to eat and sample sugar-free desserts every now and then, and these desserts are scrumptious.  This buffet dessert station may quite possibly have the best tasting sugar-free banana cream pie I have ever tasted! It tasted better than many regular banana cream pies I've tried!   VERDICT:  This buffet is definitely a go!  (Who could turn down such a tasty and affordable buffet??!)  No doubt I will be back for more of that delish sugar-free banana cream pie and that amazing spread.  :)",

The remodel was nice but the food got much worse although the price went up by $3+. I visited the buffet for breakfast and lunch (decided not to bother for dinner). The southern food has virtually disappeared and only a few of the dishes previously served from the French Market buffet are there. It also seems the executive chef has changed because the food tastes worse for a lot of the dishes. And the shrimp...my gosh, I told management 3x that the shrimp was old/bad/spoiled and 3x they kept changing the shrimp and it was still bad. I'm sure many people got sick that day. Also, they serve menudo for breakfast but not for lunch? If you're looking for a vestige from the French Market go elsewhere, you won't find it at Medley anymore. Sadly, I will pass on this buffet which is one of the reasons why I go to the Orleans in the first place as it was once one of my favorite buffets to go to.",

    "text": "This is, by far, my favorite buffet in all of Vegas Valley. There are a lot of things I really enjoy and the taste and temperature is very consistent. The shrimp scampi is a must if you aren't allergic to shrimp. The prime rib isn't the best, but it is still pretty yummy. Also, there is SUSHI. Which is actually fresh tasting and delicious. They only offer a few different rolls, but it is better quality sushi than you would expect.  The vegetable sides are really where this buffet stands out, in my opinion. Especially the roasted potatoes by the BBQ section, the Lyonnais potatoes in the Frenchy section, and the greens beans all the way down at the end in Italian/Asian.  It reminds me of back home in Texas. And I don't say that about much. The only thing lacking, which I would have expected to see in a New Orleans-themed place, was rolls of some kind. They had fantastic corn bread, but no good yeast rolls like you get down South.",

We heard the other table say \"oh why do we get this?\" So, at the end of our dinner we asked for our souvenir glasses and he said, oh no you don't get it. He was asking for the receipt that he took. He tried to argue and got his supervisor who was also clueless, so we had to go to cashier. Needless to say, we got our souvenir glasses. They just didn't seem to care. Also, we left our sun glasses by accident on the table and guess what....when we returned they said they couldn't find them. Hmmmm I wonder why? I know they stole them!!!

    "text": "Let me start by saying I was rather impressed with the quality of the cuisine at the buffet. I'll begin on a positive note before delving into the depths of my irritation with this place. I went twice during my stay. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The breakfast was one of the best breakfast buffets I have visited in a while and the dinner was pretty top notch as well. There was a good variety of steaks during the Saturday night dinner buffet with a good supporting cast of potatoes, veggies and other buffet staples. The grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms were a nice touch. The problem I have is with the mandatory 18 percent gratuity for a large party. We stayed at the Orleans over a weekend for a family reunion and gathering of friends who had not seen each other in some time. Our party for dinner was approaching 50 bodies and we got there prior to their opeing for dinner and gave plenty of notice ahead of time. We did not just show up and ask for a table for 50. We paid in small groups (immediate families, etc) and were all charged the 18 percent. I can see an 18 percent tip at a restaurant where the waiter or waitress takes your order, fills your drinks, deals with special requests and is attentive to your table. An 18 percent tip at a buffet is over the top to begin with, but outrageous when you consider the drinks were running empty and the waiter was rude and acted as though we were putting him out. The tip was in the $150 range for a lack luster, one-star performance from the waiter. If you have a casino \"Club Card\", you'll need one card for every two people to get the discount and there was no price break for children. The quality of the food was the saving grace, making this an overall three star rating for me.",

On Friday around noon, we had to go to AutoZone and Orleans Casino just happened to be around the corner...we said...why not?  The buffet has no lines which was nice...Yes it is nothing like the buffet you experience on the strip but for the price, it is ok...not bad.  * Price:  $8.99/person...CHEAP  * Food: NO CRABS but small cocktail shrimps with shells still on them.  My most memorable was Mongolian BBQ...it's descent (oh don't ask for beef...it's tough and tasteless) Crawfish available...but dry.  Oh I would stay away from the desserts...  * Service = pretty attentive.  * Ambiance = honestly, it has a feel of run-down old casino buffet but it's ok.  It has it's charm...very relaxed and casual.    Ok, no sophisticated gourmet here...basically, if you dream of being able to go to a mall food court and eat whatever you want, all you want....this place is it.",

    "text": "This place is awesome if you are able to take down a lot of food. If I were able to post pictures, I would post one of the many pictures we took of 21 plates of empty crawfish shells on our table :D It was not a one man job, it took 3 guys and 1 girl.   I didn't just eat the crawfish. Their many stations offer you a variety of ethnic foods ranging from Italian to Asian and Mexican. Their meat items would be among the best. I favored their grilled sausages (wow, I thought about that sentence to try avoiding any 2nd meanings...). The majority of their food was mediocre at best, but they have some jewels.  The service is pretty efficient here. They come by every so often to check on your status and to refill your drinks. For the most part, they are very nice except for one or two of them. Many of them do have a good sense of humor and had a laugh with us when they came to look at all the plates. A lot of the other patrons came by to take pictures of us and give us some encouragement.  The environment was pretty spacious. It gives you a lot of room to move around without having to run into people on accident like some other buffets. It was a comfortable setting, just don't look around too much to see what other people do with their food. It can become pretty bizarre.  Overall, this is a good place to go to with family and friends. There is plenty of food selections, so you'll be able to find something you enjoy with very little ease. People are overall pretty friendly here, so you won't feel uncomfortable much. If you love crawfish, just come here for that because that alone made it worth the money for us, as you can probably tell from my introduction. I believe lunch was around $8 and dinner around $16. It is definitely worth a visit.   I gave this restaurant 3 stars because I judge establishments on overall quality, not just on the amount of food that I can eat. If I did that, almost any restaurant would get 5 stars. They do have some excellent food, but overall, there are some bumps. This is a very good 3-star establishment though that will most likely not let you down.",

I have eaten here many times. The food is not outstanding but there is plenty of variety and I can always find things here that I like. The salad bar recently had marinated artichoke hearts which is a big plus for me. The beef ribs are meaty, tender and flavorful. And you can gorge yourself on the shrimp and crayfish. And numerous other offerings keep me returning. I found the dessert bar to be just so-so but overall it's a good buffet. And I'd have to say that the prices make it one of the best buffet values in town. If you present a B-Connected card which is free from the Orleans casino, you'll save an extra dollar on the buffet. The same card is valid at all Boyd Gaming properties.",

Food was hot and from the amount of people there was a good turn of fresh food.  Nice layout too - spacious and  no rude people.  Keep Calm Get Buffet On! :)    My favorite was the crab legs, crawdads, peel-n-eat shrimp, when given the right cut the baby back ribs were excellent and beef ribs were pretty cool too.  I had tiny bits of everything and didn't feel like those Wall-E floaty people!  Dessert was alright.  I did like the coffee ice cream.  Pumpkin - not so much.   I'd go back.",

    "text": "If I had a choice, I'd still eat at the Courtyard Cafe with the lower rating I gave that because I don't like waiting in line, and it was a long wait - but mostly because it was senior day, and all the seniors who were members of B-Connected had their buy one get one free coupons.  I also don't like competing for food at the buffet line.  So, that said, what I'm saying is that the cons are that i don't like that the place was too popular.  And I can understand why it was popular on the day we went.  Of course, the senior couples are eating at half price, which is a great deal because the regular price for lunch is $8.99.  $8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.  The variety is good: you have American, Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc. stations, and the quality is good for a buffet (I tend to rate buffet food with a lower expectation that sit-down food).  I enjoyed the shredded pork carnitas, the chile verde pork was okay, and the bbq ribs, I enjoyed also - I can't remember everything I had, now, but I do remember sampling a variety, and I normally don't do that at a buffet.  I normally have two servings and stop.  Here, I think I went back three times, then went for soup (I had a cup/bowl of the hot and sour, and that was a bit disappointing - the broth was too thin).    The popular item seemed to be the craw-fish. I passed by tables where people had stacks of craw-fish on their plates.  I myself, took a nice quantity of shrimp, and except for peeling the shell, basically had a nice shrimp cocktail (on a plate).   If the line is super long, like out the door (as it was this day), I'll probably end up at the Courtyard cafe, but if the line is not too bad, and I'm hungry, you'll be finding me in this line.",

In the past, I never noticed them  putting out food that is way past it's prime.  However, there were several items I used to enjoy that should have gone into a compost bin rather than being served as food.  Watermelon and some items at the salad bar were especially disappointing since I had enjoyed them in the past. My boyfriend is the meat eater, and he said the quality of the meat had gone down too.  The pricer Sunday brunch was the most pleasant of the meals we had.   The free champagne, which wasn't bad, helped make the experience more enjoyable.  They had better fruit on Sunday, and had a  chocolate fountain to dip fruit, rice krispy treats, macaroons and marshmallows in.     I never cared for the cakes and pies at the French Market Buffet.  They are pretty, but like most Vegas buffet desserts, they taste like they use a cheap oil instead of butter.  The cobbler is usually good, and so is their ice cream and gelato.  We always like the servers and tip them even if the quality of the food is bad.  It is not their fault.",

Anyhow me and my friend got in because me and him use the coupon we had where you get a free meal at the buffet so was lucky to not spend much of anything here. Now onto the food although it was good they didn't have many options to choose from with the foods at each station it was limited at best but the food was good just wish they kept up with the freshness of the food I went to get my plate the first time got some chicken bit into it as I sat down and it was dry and not that fresh but the second time I got some it was fresh and chewable just wish they were consisted with stuff like that also got the pizza it was good and hush puppies they were delicious and I got some mac and cheese out of the rest of the stuff I mentioned that was the worst no flavor bland and even if you added salt or pepper to it it still tasted awful. Besides that are server who got us our drinks worked her was very friendly and always at are table to make sure we were okay and got our refills we also gave him a tip as he worked hard and went that extra mile for us. Overall this buffet is okay would I say this buffet is one of the best out here no not a chance but you do get your money's worth besides the limited options of food and dessert and you'll leave here full I probably might come back one day as it's not really that bad and the customer service is good I give this place 3 stars.",
