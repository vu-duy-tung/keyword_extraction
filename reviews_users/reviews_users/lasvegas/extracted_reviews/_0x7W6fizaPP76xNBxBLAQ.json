I picked it up to eat at home with family for the first time, the service was great. Everyone is so kind, I came in a bit early but they made sure my food was started ASAP. So I received it fresh and hot. I can't wait to eat here again and try more items off the menu! Favorite Greek spot in town!",

    "text": "I love Stephano's! I've tried their gyro and their gyro bowl and I've been satisfied with it every time. The first time I did order rice and the rice was undercooked but since then it's been . The baklava is amazing as well. I know you can order a tray of baklava if you want it for an event. The one good thing about this place is that they have a variety of sauces. So if you don't like the tzatziki sauce, there are other sauces to pick from.  The French fries are delish! My kids love them because they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and actually I really look forward to it as well. They even gave me a free soda when they were really busy as I was waiting for take out! It's definitely well worth your time to come here even if you may think it's more pricey. Parking can be a pain in that center but it's well worth it.",

I am addicted to the gyro and fries with sauce combo. That sauce is amazing. Almost like Chick fil a. The amount of fries that you get is surprising. I've also enjoyed the Lamb/ Beef gyro salad with the creamy Greek dressing.   Service is always good and the inside has a nice, modern and open feel to it. Friendly staff.   Only negative is that I've seen huge disparities in portion size, particularly on the salad. Sometimes it's heaping with gyro meat and sometimes it's cut pieces with 1/3rd of the meat.",

I also got a free baklava for checking in. The baklava was so freakin good but it was a miniature size. Smart tactic on their end because I now want a whole tray to myself lol.   No but seriously, I have no complaints. Yes, it's a little pricey but it is 1000% worth the price. The quality of the meat, the flavor, the tenderness, it's excellent. Not to mention all of the sauces, the soft pita bread and the flavorful rice. If I had the funds to eat here multiple times a day, every day, I absolutely would do it and never get tired of it.  I also highly recommend trying the feta fries. Or plain fries with either the \"cucumber sauce\" or their special fry sauce. Just don't miss out on their fries! So freakin good!",

The gyro meat is flavorful & cooked to perfection, the rice is that yummy sticky rice, fresh produce, Liberal portions, Only negative I could say, Tazhiki Sauce could use a stronger cucumber flavor but couldn't deduct a star that.

French fries came with a fry dipping sauce: YUMMY.. you can dine in, take out or delivery (charges a $3 fee) Plenty space to eat.. outside patio is lite up with fancy cute lights..",

I understand that it's only $7, so not expecting much portion wise. But what I was served was fairly ridiculous. There were 2-1/2 to 3 slices of gyro in it. Had more tzatziki than meat. I hope this was a mistake by the person on the line and not the standard serving. Flavors we're alright. Pita was a little dry. Really want to like this place because it's so close to home but next time I'll just suck up the drive to Parsley at Trop and Decatur. They nail it every time.",

I generally get the combo with chicken and steak. Can't go wrong with that! I've gotten the chicken leg option before but I didn't find the chicken as juicy as I'd like. I love that they offer a wheat pita bread option. I normally don't see that in Greek places. I always do the baklava check in whenever I come in. It's a nice sweet treat for after a good Greek meal!  They have condiments you can get for yourself i.e. pickled turnips, jalapenos, and lemons. (I grabbed some jalapenos just because I love them, despite it not complementing my plate). I loved the Israeli salad. It tasted super fresh and was just a refreshing side. The grilled chicken definitely tasted like it just came off a grill (good!) and the steak was noticeably tender. However, the hummus, rice, and pita paled in comparison to the meats. They were mediocre at best.  P.S. They have an outside patio with a pet waterer (dog friendly I presume!)",

I asked the woman at the register what her favorite dish was and she recommended #7, the beef shawarma combo. I'm picky about beef and was a little hesitant, but it was AMAZING and I'm definitely coming back here for it again. All the ingredients are fresh and I highly recommend getting a side of tzatziki. It's a little fluffier and thicker than most I've tried, and the flavor is delicious. I'll be back soon :)",

It's a nice, clean cut, fast food joint kinda like the vibe of Chipotle, but serving Greek food.   Their fries are not bad at all if you like the old old old school fries that BK used to serve. I can't really explain the texture but, it reminded my of the old BK fries in the breading.  I think the food items we got were okay. Tasted like fast food (lamb and beef plate). I LOVED their lemon garlic sauce and cucumber salad that came with the combo meal. That stuff is legit!!!   The lamb and beef combo plate, the meat was a bit too salty for me, and price point is way too high for what they offer. For instance, a chicken kabob plate is $13 and has rice, hummus, cucumber salad, and two mini pitas.  Their small feta fry is $5.50.   Their \"bowl\" is $10. That isn't too bad I guess, but this is how much you'd sometimes pay at a dine-in.   I'll be back to try a few more items in the future.",

The Gyros were good ( meat generally overcooked ), and the Steak Kebabs were Excellent ! The place is clean,provides good customer service and the prices are reasonable. Their tzatziki sauce is correctly prepared. They will include extra sauce ( no charge ). Kudos to them. I would recommend Stephanos. Can't speak for their other dishes. I will try some of them ( when TBD ) ...... but i'm a Gyro freak and proud of it.",

His fries were perfectly fried, it was crunchy served with a side of really good spicy mustard sauce.   I had their chicken and beef kabob served over rice, hummus and my choice of wheat pita bread. I love love hummus with pita bread! Theirs were delicious. My kabobs were a bit salty on the bottom portion, I don't usually add salt to my food since I like to watch my sodium intake. My husband did bring to my attention that they had a protein section. I shall check that out next time.   The server was nice and helpful.  The place was new and spotless.  Their prices aren't bad and their portion size is good.  Their interior is inviting and gives you that romantic vibe. It was nice and cool out for the month of May, we ate our food in their patio.",

My boss took us for lunch here to celebrate Administrative Professional Day (It's a thing, crazy, I know) and holy cow, one of the best lunches together, for sure.   I ordered the Beef Shawerma Plate ($13) and because it was before 3 pm, we were all given free drinks. The plate came with pita bread, salad, hummus, sauce (choice of tahini or tzatziki), rice and of course, the delicious beef shawarma. The pita was warm and soft and was the perfect pillow for a dollop of their hummus, your choice of sauce, rice and flavorful meat.  We also all shared Loaded Chicken Shawerma Fries ($10), which is a meal by itself. The fries are super crispy and seasoned well. It was so good dipped in hummus and also their special fry sauce. The chicken was also so flavorful.  Basically, if you think you won't like Greek food or you've had better somewhere else, try Stephano's and it may change your mind! Also, don't forget to check in for your free slice of their baklava.",

He knows how to run a business he is friendly and the quality of food is great, the portion sizes are perfect! When he left UNLV you could tell the quality and portion sizes when down a notch, I did't put two and two together until we came here for lunch and he was running the biz. Parking is a little tight and they have outside seating and from the looks of it the outdoors is dog friendly.

I know that's a strong statement but holy cow I was not impressed. $14 chicken kabob lunch special and 20 minute wait with only two people in the restaurant was the first strike. The food was not terrible but definitely not good. Chicken was bland and I had to soak it in lemon juice to get any taste out of out. Only reason this place didn't get 1 star is because the hummus was pretty good and the staff was nice. Other than that, spend a few bucks more and go to a sit down restaurant with a waiter. Can't stress enough how bland the food was.",

The menu was extensive but kinda of expensive, but hey- it was super close to my house. So I called and placed a take out order, I was told ten minutes. We arrived 15 minutes later - wanted a bit of a buffer, but that wasn't enough. My husband waited inside for about 15 minutes. After he noticed our order sitting on the counter, he asked about it and the guy behind the counter was like, oh yeah...yours is ready. Seriously.. ??? So once I got over the price and the poor service, I found the food delicious! The tzatziki sauce was on point, all the veggies were uber fresh, and the portions of meat left nothing to be desired. Hummus and pita bread was flavorful. The spinach pie was ok, but I've had better. Their rice is light and fluffy and meted in my mouth. I want to eat here more, I just need to save some $ first!",

    "text": "This was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had with any business! I ordered through Door Dash and called the restaurant immediately to confirm my order. The girl who answered the phone said sorry our system is down and we did not receive the order. Therefore, she said, they would have to wait for the driver to get there to give them the order. I told her, I could give her the order. She said unfortunately they can't do that because they can't \"trust\" people. They need to make sure it's been paid for. I was like okay. Anyway, once the order arrived at my house, I got a vegetable skewer instead of the chicken skewer I ordered. The order was clearly right on my phone. I called Stephano's and asked to speak to a manager. A girl came to the phone and I told her the situation and asked if they could \"rectify\" the situation. She said she needed to ask the owner. She came back and said unfortunately you will have to go back through door dash because it was their mistake!!! I was like what!! Door dash didn't prepare the order. After that I asked to speak to the owner. Wow, that was the wrong decision. Not only did he get loud and continue to talk over me versus listen, he hung up in MY face. Then, when we tried to call back, he continued to screen our calls and hang up the phone as soon as he answered. I HAVE NEVER AND I WILL REPEAT NEVER RECEIVED THIS HORRIFIC  UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM ANY BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY THE OWNER. I will never support this business again. I will also tell everyone I know! This was such a simple situation they could have been handled so differently. Stephano's lost our business over NOT wanting to rectify a situation over $5 dollars!!! It's amazing business' like this still exist. Keep treating people like this and your demise will be sooner than later. Unreal. I FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR LEADERSHIP THIS STAFF HAS. He was a textbook example of an egotistical person with no capability of taking any responsibly. HE LITERALLY COULDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE. A matter of fact, the employee handled the situation far better than the OWNER. It clearly shows this place doesn't care about the people that PAY THEIR BILLS. STAY AWAY!",

So light and crisp on the outside with a moist center.    Even though the bread was good, I ended up skipping most of it and eating the delicious falafel and tahini sauce, because it was so much food. The fries were fresh and the fattoush was delicious. The fattoush in particular was highly seasoned.  We also had the baklava, which tasted good but was dry.     In addition to the great entree and sides, they also have turnip pickles.  These are the best and not easy to find.   They have a sign near the beverage station that says not to be shy about asking for more sauce. I like that even though they give you enough to begin with.  The service was polite, fast, and efficient.  It's a really casual place and we ate outside on their dog-friendly patio. There weren't any dogs but the patio was full.",

    "text": "There aren't a lot of Mediterranean places around this area so I was sad on missing out on Khoury's but was quickly elated when Stephano's took over.  I first visited the week they opened and was not disappointed, portions are huge and flavors are as good as can be expected from a casual, somewhat fast food ish kinda place. Got the combo platter with Chicken shawarma and gyro. It comes with Hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread. Along with that are 3 different types of sauces: garlic, tahini and tzatziki. On a different occasion I tried their Chicken kebabs and that I enjoyed as well. My kids thoroughly enjoy their seasoned fries especially when dipped in their secret fry sauce. So addicting!  Most recently though, I wasn't quite satisfied with my order. I work close by so I decided to place a phone order for pick up. Chicken shawarma plate wasn't as good as I remembered and the sides were just ok. Ate half and threw away the rest. They have a pretty large menu though so I might try something else next time.  For dessert I've only had their baklava. It's not the best but it appeases any cravings. Don't forget to check in to get a free one! This past visit I saw grilled pita with Nutella as their newest offering, of course that caught my attention. I'd have to try that!",

We also got some cheese appetizer thing.  That was a lot better.     Sorry about the vague review.  Not saying don't try the place.  It's got 4.5 stars from a lot of people.

    "text": "Flavorful food, fresh ingredients, relaxed atmosphere, welcoming staff, and fast service.  I was sad when the other Mediterranean restuarant relocated to Village Square (great food too and great new location), however have been pleased with the opening of this little gem. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the place is neat and clean even during lunch hour rush, nice covered outdoor seating.  The seating is hard chairs, and with the high top ones, metal chairs, so feels a bit more fast food for me than stay awhile with family, however there's plenty of dine in space, and I've seen diverse mix of clientele. The taste of each of the dishes I've had so far has been great (I've been there several times for lunch over past week due to a busy schedule).  The meat is tender and flavorful, the vegetables fresh. My view is that the menu is a combination of standards that you can get several ways (e.g. chicken shawarma in white or wheat pita, as a plate with sides, or over salad), and great options I've not had at some other restuarants  (e.g. feta fries topped with feta and oregano... fabulously tasty... and ultimate greek grilled cheese with mozzarella, feta, garlic sauce,  red pepper and mint flakes, olive oil...next on my list to try).  The portion sizes for most items are large enough to have leftovers for a second meal.  The quick service makes it great for lunch (I'll have to be careful of overuse as its right near my office, lol), however nice to grab for dinner.",

Bad: They were out of white pita bread and French fries. It was 5 pm on a Sunday so not like we were there right before closing or anything?? (how can a Mediterranean restaurant be out of pita?) The falafel was super over-fried and just not good at all.  The ambience in the restaurant was a little odd. It was super quiet and I felt like the employees were all in a fight where no was talking or something. Just not a welcoming environment.  Anyway, maybe they were just off their game tonight who knows? Not likely that I will come back.",

Was in the area one day and recognized the signage. I know it was formerly a very popular Mediterranean restaurant that I loved.   Stephano's had more of a fast food feel, but with excellent customer service. The owner gave me a free baklava from my Yelp check in and a free beverage just because. Some places don't even want to give you a courtesy cup of water these days, but he was very generous.   I ordered a falafel sandwich and it was good. Someone was just a little heavy handed with the hummus. Don't get me wrong because I love me some hummus, but it was getting all over the place.   Because I enjoyed the warmth of the place and the friendliness of the staff, I'll probably be back.",

    "text": "We were excited to see that a highly rated Greek restaurant was located not far from us.  I had it bookmarked for some time so when the craving for Greek food kicked in it was time to check off that bookmark.  We ordered the Beef and Lamb Gyro Plate with extra meat.  We also got the loaded Gyro fries and an order of Moussaka.   We added a few of the Baklava to our order include our free one for checking in - sweet!  We got our food to go.  The wait was not too long and they offered us water while we waited - very nice.    They have an average size dinning room which is nothing fancy but this is a fast casual place so that was to be expected. The service was great and the young lady who took our order was awesome.  Her enthusiasm and great attitude was something you don't see too often so I was impressed.    The food was tasty with the gyro meat being the True standout.  It was moist and delicious.  You can tell that had just cut it off the spit and not reheated it which some places do.  Although we had ordered extra meat it didn't look like extra so if the normal amount is much smaller then extra is the way to go.  The Moussaka was OK.  It came in a small aluminum container and had been burnt on the edges.  We also got the loaded gyro fries which had lots of gyro meat, hummus, spices and Tabbouleh, tomatoes and red onions.  They were very good and truly lived up to the loaded name.      The gyro plates came with hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread.  The hummus was very good and plentiful.  The Israeli Salad (cucumbers, onions and tomatoes in vinegar) was OK but I would prefer a Greek salad instead.  We got the wheat pita bread which was slightly sweet tasting  and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce was very good and made a great addition to the gyro meat.  The Secret Fry Sauce had a mustard taste and seemed out of place with the cuisine.      To top off the meal was the tasty Baklava.  They had the right amount of honey to make them perfectly moist.  I had to ensure I got my fair share of the Baklava and it was worth it.  Definitely get the Baklava when you eat at Stephanos.  A good place to fill you craving for tasty Greek food.",

It's Bitter sweet because khourys had their amazing fresh pita bread and it was so convenient to home. Stephanos has amazing kabobs and falafels but store bought pita.  I went into Stephanos today and ordered a chicken kabob and falafel combo plate & and a chicken and steak kabob combo plate. The food was amazing!! But I ordered and payed extra for their garlic sauce and it was bland and it just tasted like lard? I've had their garlic sauce before at the eastern location and I don't remember it being so bland and such a little amount! Luckily I went home and had some homemade garlic sauce that my sister makes!  Other than that, everything else was exceptional! The food and service was great and I will be back for my quick fix of Greek Mediterranean food!",

Employees caring too much about filling the plastic sauce containers for to gos and the ice machine being empty. Then it was the food quality and amount. I used to work for a restaurant like this in another part of the country and it was the same thing. Stretch every dime into a dollar at the cost of the customer experience.  The food is not cheap either. A kabob plate is 15$. Not looking to pay back your small business loan with my order.  We went in on Thursday and it was the straw that broke the camels back. I brought a friend in and told them it was good. Again the ice machine was out. She ordered a gyro and when it came out it was not made the way that the picture displayed it. It was a bit dreadful. When she spoke to the gentleman behind the counter it was a series of excuses. She wanted lettuce. Lettuce and he was going to charge for that. He offered to remake the gyro and this time when it came out it was fresh snd the way it was supposed to be.  Just was the nail in the coffin. I can't attest to the other shops but I do know they in the past when the taller guy with the dark pony tail was there at the Fort Apache location, the food and portions were worthy of 15-17$. I'll go to the great Greek instead. Great device lower price and huge portions!",

Let's just say there wasn't anything left....I didn't think about getting a picture of my setup before it was almost eaten up. Any time I'm in Vegas I make it a point to stop in here and enjoy everything from , hummus, the grape leaves, salad, gyro, all the kabobs & baklava!! I'll  be back in soon",

I could kick myself for not coming here to eat so much sooner! Better late than never right? You see this has been bookmarked for well... let's just say a very long time. I decided that this past weekend was going to be the time I gave in and just tried them out. The great thing about Stephano's is that they are located super close to home! This could actually also be a bad thing but for now let's stick with the good!  Upon arriving I must've picked a great night to come because they weren't busy at all! That's a score especially when you are hungry! I walked in and BAM you are immediately faced with a huge menu! I knew I was going to be doing a take out order so I wanted to make sure I had exactly what I wanted mapped out before making my way to the counter. The ambiance of the place is pretty chill and I could really appreciate the decor and just overall vibe of the place. Thanks to my fellow Yelper's for posting those tasty looking pictures I was already fixed on the Loaded Beef and Lamb Gyro Fries! My mom needed to order as well so her choice was the Beef and Lamb Gyro Pita. Based off the reviews I knew that I couldn't go wrong with either of these two selections AND it helped that the cashier endorsed these two items as well!   Total wait time for my food to actually be ready was under 15 minutes so another kudos for them for being fast and efficient! I will be visiting on the regular now, not only because the food is great but the service was pretty good as well. There are seriously several other items on the menu that I am keeping my taste buds open to. It's nothing like have a local restaurant in the area that can execute all of these things. Sincerely a happy and full customer :-)",

I had to tell them which container was the large compared to the medium size one they were trying to give me. They gave me a hard time about ordering half cucumber and pita with a party size hummus. My Henderson location is by far much more friendlier. I'm giving them a 2 star rating only because the dressing n hummus are still so very yummy. This will be the first and last time I'm giving them any of my business at this location.",

Seeing as I just graduated, I don't think I'll be visiting that location anymore.   Anyway, I usually order the shrimp kebab plate or a salad with shrimp! Their shrimp is really good & cooked very well. The plate comes with rice, protein, a little salad, hummus, and a side of pita bread (choice of white or wheat). Definitely able to eat half and get full so I save the other half for my next meal. Their salads are also pretty big and so refreshing!  I haven't actually dined in here (just take out) so I can't vouch for their service but every time I pick up my food, they've always greeted me & never got my food order wrong. So I think that's pretty good lol",

Their feta is so flavorful. Try the feta and olives appetizer, it's delicious! Oh and their feta fries are topped with melted cheese, herbs, and crumbled feta, with a typical delicious fry sauce that has a bit of a tangy kick. The spinach pie is absolutely delicious with the most crumbly and tasty pastry. And of course, no Greek spot is complete without the delicious buttery rice pilaf, and theirs was no exception! This food was so good that after dinner last night, we decided to order lunch from their Henderson location.",

You can also get pita bread and hummus with it as well. The meal cost around $13 and the portions were very good for the price! I enjoyed the chicken as it was cooked very well and tender! Some places tend to overcook the chicken where it becomes dry. The pita was fresh and they gave plenty hummus! I would definitely order this again as it helps me stick to my diet.

The rice is SOOOOO good. We also recommend their fries and don't forget their fry sauce! That stuff is so good we even dip our chicken in it. Hummus is pretty good too. The only thing I wish they had was fresh pita. Other than that this place is amazing. Their filet kabob and their Greek salad is good! I recommend the house dressing. Overall we love this place and will continue to order here! They never disappoint.",

I order a half chicken and lamb/beef plate. All is great! The service is good but every time they seem confused about my order. I want the pita that they serve with the 1/2 chicken to be whole not cut in half and every time it's a long conversation about it. Their sauces are very good and wonderful compliments for their food.   The main complaint about this place it the terrible music! It is techno sometimes and other times dance music or trance music. It's always terrible! I don't want to listen to this music while I'm trying to enjoy a meal.   I will come back but probably a take out order since the music is terrible.",

    "text": "Been to the Stephano's on Maryland by UNLV & I absolutely loved it! I can definitely say the same about this location.  Their menus are super simple, have many options for anyone & they are flexible to substitutions. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get, I even had leftovers, which says a lot for me expecting a baby in a few days, lol! Personally, the plates are best bet since you have so many options, but they have a combo deals as well.  Here's what we ordered: Me: Chicken shwerma plate w/ French fries substituted for the isreli salad, came with 3 kinds of sauces. Hubby: Combo plate of chicken kebab & steak kebab w/ French fries substituted for salad, came with one red creamy sauce (IDK the name) Mom: Beef Dorme? Plate, idk but it was cut pieces of beef Dad: Beef Kofta plate Grandma: Chicken shewerma plate Little brother: Kids meal w/ 2 chicken kebabs & French fries w/ red creamy sauce (I'm assuming now it's their fry sauce lol)  All plates came with choice of white or wheat pita bread which is warmed & wrapped in foil. And the typical sides are the rice, isreli salad & hummus, but as I mentioned before they are flexible w/ substitutions & you can substitute any of your sides w/ a small appetizer... Which I think is SUPER awesome.  You order at the register, take a seat & they serve you, the staff was super friendly & the cashier was awesome at taking the order cuz we had a pretty complicated one in my opinion haha. But everything came out just as we had ordered & in a timely manner. The store is clean & let me say their bathroom is hilariously large for one toilet lol, but still spic & span clean nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, the food is awesome, there's something for everyone & it's in a great area of Las Vegas instead of dealing with all the trouble of going across a university & dealing w/ a bunch of college kids grabbing a bite.",

Having tried authentic Arabic and Mediterranean food in the middle east, I feel that it could have been seasoned a bit more but very well,cooked and tender, the pita bread was soft and warm and didn't have that \"store bought\" texture. The French fries was forgettable, I didnt try any of their special fries and their dipping sauce was good but nothing special.   Service was quick and friendly. Indoor and outdoor dining areas are clean and ambiance is very laid back. I'll return and try their lamb dishes and give their fries another try.

It's quick service so you order and pay at the counter, they give you a number and then bring your food out to you.   Ordering was quick and easy, staff was friendly. I interacted with 3 female employees and they were all friendly. There's plenty of indoor seating as well as a nice, well lit patio. Food came out quicker than I expected!   We enjoyed the gyro meat greek salad, hummus and pita and a kid's gyro bowl w/ rice.   The salad was great. There was a few vinaigrette dressing variations but I went with the classic version. Salad had plenty of the essentials: good greens, feta, olives, cucs, red onion and of course gyro meat. The portion size of the meat was good, not over the top tons of meat but enough where I felt full and there's definitely salad leftover for lunch tomorrow.   The kids meal was decent; the bowl was just gyro meat & rice and comes with a cup for a fountain drink. My little one is a foodie so we also got hummus and pita which was good. Not amazing but good. It's nice that they offer a whole wheat or white option for the pita and we received plenty of it.   They offer a bite sized baklava here if you check in on yelp or post a pic on social media, so be sure to take advantage of that so you'll have a sweet treat after your meal. The baklava was yummy, not the best I've ever had but certainly satisfying for a bite-sized dessert.   Overall, I say this place is worth trying when you want a good, mediterranean meal in a casual setting.",

Personally, I do feel that this place is on the pricier end but you can't put a price on fresh, authentic food. Oh also, do yourself a favor and get the feta fries!! Delicious.   The interior is clean and aesthetically pleasing. They have an outdoor patio where I've taken my dog before, which is very nice. The reason I've taken off a star is because the few times I've been here, service hasn't been very friendly and I've felt like a bother coming up to order. But other than that, highly recommend!",

They gave me about 3-5 olives and 7 chunks of feta cheese which is a ridiculously stupid ratio.  They don't have a working phone number so I couldn't even call and resolve this. The whole purpose of post-mates is not having to leave my home. They kept trying to blame postmates when all postmates does is bring my food from point A to point B. The back floors are beyond dirty with trash & no one wears gloves or hair. One of the chefs wears a SnapBack while cooking & has sweat dripping.. gross.. I'd like to know how it's possible to not cook an order fully when the restaurant is empty. Just don't go. I'm too annoyed to even finish this interview.",

The person that took my order was very nice and cool, as was the other workers I interacted with. I ordered a number 8 with an extra chicken skewer. Everything was good, and I really liked the garlic sauce because it was very garlicy. The reason for the 3 stars is the presentation of the food compared to the price. With tip and everything for one person came to almost $25 (no drink), but the presentation of the food looked like a low end, cheap $7 food plate. For that price at other middle eastern/Mediterranean restaurants, you get a lot more rice, meat, and metal utensils AND drink. I MIGHT be back if it's last resort and I don't want to drive far, but overall good experience.  Updated: Ordered a doner kabob and well.......no, just no. Let's just leave it at that.",

Each choice also leaves you feeling SUPER SATISFIED - and since it's all made fresh, there's less guilt afterwards. So glad they have options like the vegetarian rice which isn't cooked in chicken broth to make this place vegan/vegetarian friendly too   I've ordered Stephano's to go and have had no problems at all with pick ups/orders. I've also been to both this location and the other on the South East end of vegas - this one definitely has more seating, but both have seating both inside and outside with tables you can push together for bigger parties if needed. Both spots also had the friendliest staff and the wait time for food has never exceeded 10-15 minutes.  *The only reason I had to subtract a star was because of the price. Some of the choices are a bit more expensive than I'd like, but still doesn't mean this place isn't totally worth it!",

This time we ordered gyro, say yee-row, plates that included a Greek salad, pita bread, rice, tzatziki sauce and hummus. The lamb and beef yee-row, if you will, was freshly sliced, bountiful and juicy.  Everything else on our plate was very good with the exception of the bread which was dry.",

Also,  the option for their \"healthy \" Greek vinagerette salad dressing represented a container of nothing but flavorless oil.  The free piece of baklava upon check in wasn't too bad though",

Stephano's is affordable as it is delicious. I ordered the gyro plate and devoured the entire thing. They totally give you more than enough to split with two people. The service was awesome and on point. My coworkers and I sat outside in the patio area which was a nice touch. Really enjoyed my meal and the service!",

They have so many excellent choices, my favorite meals are the filet mignon steak kebab plate, the chicken kebab plate, and the kofta plate. The great thing about their plates is that they come with so many excellent side choices. You can get a delicious and healthy Israeli or Greek salad as one of your sides. There aren't many places around my office where you can find great tasting salads. Their salads are very fresh and I need all the vegetables I can get.   I prefer to get their fries as my second side choice. Their fries are amazing! Better than any other place that serves fries! Get the fries and their secret fry sauce, you will come back wanting more!   One thing I love about their location is that they take online orders through their website. This saves me so much time during my lunch break. I can order online and as soon as I get to their restaurant the food is ready for me. The service is 5 star every time I am here. The owner and the staff make sure that the food and the experience is excellent every time.",

    "text": "First, let me say that the food is good.  Quite good in fact.  However,  the prices aren't in line with a faster food style, informal  / take away place.    I've picked up take out from here, twice now.  I'm going to say that the food (even 5 minutes before closing) has been consistent.    Now, I'm going to get into pricing  (which is where I am bummed out )  almost 30 bucks for 2 people to eat take out is pretty spendy in my book.   The Falafel Wrap is good ( as a vegetarian option,  it should have lettuce on it,  I did order lettuce on it, but noticed when I got home that someone had forgotten to put it on) But 7, (Yes! SEVEN Dollars) for a falafel wrap, is , (just the wrap) is kinda over priced....  I also got a large greek salad, 8 dollars Lg, 7 dollars Sm. Good salad,  but when a person orders an 8 dollar salad,  I was really disappointed at the tiny amount of olives, 7 unpitted olives. Major hazard,  as there's no note on the container,  about pitts.  After searching the menu (in super tiny print,  I found - Olives contain pits) Now, again 8 bucks for a salad isnt crazy, but its not cheap either.  7 olives,  and it is a real bummer that Stephanos, doesn't pit their olives,  at the price point that they're charging,  please pit the olives!    I also ordered a Beef & Lamb Gyro wrap, husband said it was good, but that the meat was dry :/ but that it had good flavor.   I'm sure that I will eat here again,  but I would love to see a daily special,  or a reasonably priced lunch special.    The fries are good, but should be served hot.",

Definitely not an eat-and-go place so don't come in if you're on a time crunch. Been there twice in the last two weeks and it's always been a bit long for simpler menu items.  I usually always order the gyro plate and am satisfied with the volume of food. Last time the gyro meat was cooked but served cold. Fiance had her gyro happily replaced because meat was cold. Disappointed to see it was attempted to be served.  Will continue being a customer, but a loyalty program would be nice for one of the more expensive options in town.",

The concept is quick service, although we dined in. However, the prices are more than other quick service restaurants. We spent close to $40 for two of us. The food is super tasty though and I will definitiely dine here again. I know they are new and may be ironing out the kinks, but I would make the recommendation that the service should be faster. We didnt mind as much because we were dining in, but it was on the slow end for a quick service restaurant that was not busy when we arrived.  Also, the texture of the chicken shawarma leaves something to be desired. The taste was excellent, but the texture was a little on the rubber-side. Perhaps use better chicken or a different preparation method? Regardless, I will be back. This place is good and in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "I am amazed I haven't written a review for Stephanos earlier. I have been coming here for quite a while (at least 2 years). Its the closest Greek place to where I live and take out is always easy.   Service is promoting, but they will take their time sometimes to answer the phone or pick up when they feel like it(E.G. when I was picking up my order, someone called and the phone answered 8 times before whoever's it was hung up. My wife called and was waiting at least 5 minutes before I called and they answered within 30 seconds.).  Food has always been great. I always go to the Traditional gyro and it never fails for me. I would like more vegetables, but I love the amount of meat and frankly that gyro just cant pack anything else in there! The free dessert they offer at Yelp check in is good. I always pick that up! If you are hungry hungry, a plate is definitely enough. Last note in the Food section, I am in love with their garlic sauce. I never knew something as simple as garlic and olive oil (there has to be something else) would taste as amazing. They provide a serving with all take orders, but I try to remember to ask for another.  Value: so when I first starting coming here, the cost seemed more reasonable. The value was great, but recently I am spending more than $40 on three menu items feeding three people. Not saying it is completely ridiculous, but it's a change that I have seen. Other Greek places in the valley have a little better value with this recent change, but it's not something that would utterly dissuade me from returning entirely, but it does give me pause.  Ambiance: The place has plenty of seating and the music sets a good mood. Definitely like the outside area where you can bring doggos.  Summary: Good place, good food, on the upper end of medium pricing, decent service.",

It was dry and hard to swallow without lubricating it with yogurt sauce. What gives? The Maryland location is very good but not this location.  The chicken meat should be moist and succulent not dry and chewy. It was shaved off and left in a pan for a few hours or more then scooped out with tongs and served to an unwitting public. I ordered a shawarma not chicken jerky. It turned me off from going to either now.",

The expanded menu and lunch specials are much appreciated, and I'm a fan of the patio seating as well. Service is friendly with ordering suggestions and helpful with packing leftovers.   I've come in a couple of times and the salads are my go-to choice (several dressing options), always fresh with ample toppings. A friend raves about their chicken shawarma, but when I recently branched out to try the gyro plate, I found the meat on the dry side. Whenever I go, it's hard to resist getting an order of fries- even the \"small\" side ($3) is a heaping, sharable portion, served with their addictive fry sauce. Speaking of sauces, they're definitely the forte here and I also highly recommend the garlic sauce.  TIP: Free baklava with Yelp check in!",

    "text": "Stephano's is my all time go-to for Mediterranean food. As you walked out your car, you can immediately smell the food that quickly gets that stomach grumbling lol!   First time I came here, I got (highly recommended by staff) the filet minon rice plate. It came with hummus, pita bread & salad on the side. For the sauce, I got the Tziki (Greek) sauce.  Thoughts on the food: my filet minon was a bit bland and under season. So the sauce was definitely needed for dipping. My fiance got the beef shawarma rice plate w/ the same sides. For the sauce, he got the garlic sauce.  Thoughts on the food: contrary to my filet minon, his beef shawarma was perfectly seasoned. Added a bit of my Greek sauce and it was perfect. His garlic sauce didn't match much in my opinion.   If you come in from 11am-3pm, they have a lunch special going on: add a drink to every plate you get.  The following times I came in, I just got the rice bowl, rather than the plate. I didn't eat the hummus much last time. So the bowl came with rice, the beef, salad, and pita bread. I would always request for the Tiziki sauce though.   Staff are always so helpful and pleasant. And the bathroom, feels very Greek to me ;)   YELP CHECK IN ALERT! Check in for a free baklava The only downfall I can really say is that the food can get a bit expensive, but the taste make it so worth it",

    "text": "I found Stephano's while stopping at the Starbucks in the same shopping center, and returned later to get something for dinner.  It's a counter spot, but you're given a number and the food is delivered to your table if you're eating in. I had originally planned to take out, but after deciding to order a shawarma pita wrap, I figured it would be too messy to eat on my lap at the hospital down the block. Good thing I did.  First off, I ordered my wrap on whole wheat pita, but realized that it was on white. The young lady who had taken my order said (I don't remember which) that either she or the kitchen had made a mistake, and offered to remake it. I didn't have the time to wait and knew that reheating a new one would be a disaster, so she said I could return the next night and get another one on the house. Great customer service!  Though the pita was wrong, the filling was delicious - moist and flavorful chicken, and some of the best tzaziki I've ever had. I enjoyed it so much, I was going to pass on the offer, but accepted it anyway.  Returned the next night. My step-daughter wanted the wrap, so I ordered a beef and lamb gyro platter. Mine was very tasty - the meat was a bit too salty for my taste, but probably not anyone else's - and had a large amount of gyro meat, a big portion of rice, and Greek salad. The day before, I had asked if the salad was very vinegary and she told me it was. I personally have a hard time with a lot of vinegar. This time I had it anyway, but mixed it with the rice, and that took the edge off the tangy dressing. The shawarma wrap was a big success, too.  I know we'll be visiting this area regularly, so Stephano's will be seeing more of us before too long.",

    "text": "So always been fan of Stephano's for sometime since my first visit at the eastern location. It would be one of my stable recovery spots after solid trainer bike class session. Since it stopped not often on that side of town. So thrilled knowing that they opened another location so close to my house. I was in greek kind of mood and like need get me some Stephano's again!   One thing about restaurants with multiple locations always worry about consistency with the food. Stephano's have to say was very happy that the food was just as memorable and delicious from my first visit.  I usually order the same plate usually gyro plate. It one of my favorite dishes. I love the rice and hummus that comes with the plates. The portion size will never disappoint. If not starving I find it hard to finish the whole plate. The gyro and beef combo plate. One of my favorites. The gyro has amazing seasoning, then add tomato and onions, warm pita bread, and tzatziki brings it full circle. The hummus one of my favorite around town. I could get bowl of that alone and be in Hummus heaven. The prices are always affordable. Stephano's no doubt in my top five spots for Greek food in Vegas. Just happy that one close to my house.  If there one thing that does make this Stephano stand out then the other ones. Inside got more new feel to it then the eastern location. The dining area is slightly bigger, feels more spacious with higher ceiling, more well lit, couple options comes to seating, and if want watch sports on widescreen they have decent size one that can chill watching sports while you eat. The patio area is different set up.   The staff is amazing and five star service just like the eastern location. Friendly. Attentive. Great service.",

Fresh and the chicken kebab is always moist, never dry.  Charboiled and seasoned perfectly.   I ordered: $11 Chicken Kebab bowl.  Included their delicious fluffy rice and their Israeli salad.  That salad is freaking good, some pita slices and oh let'sssss not forget the sauces.  My personal favorite is the tahini and tzatziki.   They have these oddly yummy pickled turnips?  I think I may have that wrong but yeah they're purple and it just tastes good with everything.    The decor here I love.  They also have an outside seating area to enjoy your food when it's not crazy hot outside. It's pretty.   They also have wine on tap as well as beer.  Not big on drinking but if you happen to be well not only will you have delicious food but also a variety of drinks to choose from.   So so good.  Can't wait to come back.",

Growing up, I was never around Greek and Mediterranean food enough to try it and now I'm venturing out, I'm glad I did! I got the skewer combo they have and I mixed it with chicken and steak. The steak skewer is toooo diiieeee for. It is so soft and tender, it's not a cheap steak on a stick. It tastes like filet Mignon (so yummy) and the chicken is so flavorful as well. I got the fluffy pilaf rice, some sort of vinegrate salad and a hummus and naan bread on the side. It was a lot but so worth it!! I loved everything. The staff here are cool and the place looks super cute inside. Its chic enough, I wouldn't mind going on a date there  I left full and satisfied. Definitely recommend!",

I thought the review was being overly critical saying it was like a fast food place, but it totally was.  There are a lot of Greek places in town where you order and pay at the counter, but this truly reminds you of a fast food restaurant.",

(gyros meat, rice, Israeli salad--finely chopped onion, tomato and cucumber in vinegar, pita on the side). Well done. I like that they offer white or wheat pita. If it was whole wheat that would be awesome. Baklava was tasty. More cinnamon and less honey then I'm used to. They add crushed pistachios. They have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly. They have 2 TVs mounted on the wall.  Showing football at the time. Beer and wine coming soon. Prices typical. Clean. Cool lighting and seating. I love on the other side of the valley but would definitely go back when I'm in the area.",

Don't come here if you're trying to eat healthy because skipping out on the pita and butter is just a mistake. Enjoy the shawarma chicken and the gyros definitely are winners. Even though the food is tasty I do think that prices are higher than they should be, this should be a fast food type of pricing place... max $10 for a plate the prices shouldn't reach $14.

All I can Ask for is that a company recognizes when they can do better. I'm so glad that they did, because the food, even to go, was amazing. We had the grape leaves which fresh, and a delicious Greek salad that didn't seem soggy by the time it was delivered. The beef Shawarma sandwich was tender,  and didn't have all the fat most places do. Finally, the pita and onions were fresh! I'm so glad that we asked for the turnips on the side,  because that made the meal! Thank you to my helper on the phone tonight, you heard and delivered!",

In fact guests who ordered after me received there food before me, I finally asked someone if my food was ready because I thought they had forgotten about me. Finally got my food went home and it was just ok. Not worth the time and money for what we received.  *update* I have given this place another try and it is definitely delicious.

I don't know what his idea of fresh is but for me taking it out of the frig to reheat and serve is not fresh.... Nor did I appreciate the cold food for my $25 lunch order.  Excuses excuses... Unless the salad the meat was sitting on was an ice salad the meat being cold all the way to the center just doesn't happen. I don't cook, I do take out quite frequently. You think this takeout was something original causing some extraordinary circumstance... May have been fresh off the grill in their heads, who knows. It was still cold.

I did call ahead to see if their Dolma (grape leaves) were hot or cold/ meat or not. They are cold with rice and tomato paste. I decided to pass. I placed my order online which was very easy, no need to create an account, all the selections were simple and you can customize your order. We ordered a combo plate and a shwerma plate. The food arrived at 4:25pm even though the order confirmation said it would take much longer. That was nice. The delivery person was very friendly and kind. The food was AMAZING and arrived in nice plastic plates with clear covers. The french fries were those perfectly lightly battered kind. So flavorful. Krispy on the outside. They came with a special dipping sauce which is a light orange cream color and tasted kind of honey mustard-y. VERY good. My husband is a bit picky so it means a lot when he says \"This place is my new favorite. Not a single thing was less than perfect.\" The israeli salad was flavorful, fresh and just a tiny spicy. Not boring at all. The Taziki sauce is rich and cool. Pita bread is hot, fresh, soft and abuntant. Two big breads per order. We got regular and whole wheat. The hummus was perfect. The meats were just as we hoped they would be. Perfectly flavored and visually appealing. It was a food ordering dream come True. I can usually put food away but I couldn't finish my whole plate and I had them hold the rice. I am so glad this place opened. I certainly recommend this place to anyone who is hungry.",

Now it's more of an overpriced cafe Rio type chain without the fun of getting to watch the food being prepared. I was also very unimpressed with their menu it was small Font size and laid out in a way that was somewhat confusing. I had the filet mignon salad. The portion sizes as far as the actual meat were concerned were reasonable and the flavor was quite good but I felt as though the salad was very haphazardly put together for $13.00. With their vinaigrette it was a very enjoyable salad they did not skimp on most of the required elements of the salad. Overall flavor five stars on the salad. They lost a star for this one though. I feel that it is ridiculous that there was a tip option on the point-of-sale register. It's mainly cafeteria style with no actual service to speak of other than them bringing the food to your table so why in the world would I tip you?",

Always a nice plus. Portion was huge. I couldn't finish it.   We ate at the patio area, which was really pleasant with the good weather. The food was super prompt.

The shawarma plate is huge and comes with pita and hummus.  My daughter got chicken shawarma and fries....those fries are some crispy well seasoned fries.  I couldn't help but steal a few from her plate.  There's also an outdoor area for kiddos so they can run around while the adults eat as well.",

I would say that you should definitely order the gyro over the shawarma because it's not really shawarma lol. Actually it tasted nothing like shawarma. Also the falafel is cool but nothing amazing. Probably a box mix. The hommos was bland as hell but I understand that that is what the American audience wants. The fries looked hella good though and the Baba ganoush was good considering it was a little out of the ordinary.  If I sound critical it's because I am lol. I'm Lebanese so I know what I'm looking for. I would come back here to try their gyro bc I'm no doubt guessing that the owners are Greek and not Arabs (I had thought they might be arab bc of the \"shawarma\" spit) so their gyro is probably good lol.  Try it for yourself though!",

It's just a myriad of flavors that don't stop delighting your tastebuds. Fresh hot pita bread, the cool creamy tzatsiki sauce, the flame grilled chicken, beef & lamb, the crisp salads, smooth & dreamy hummus, the luscious feta cheese, oh and that garlic sauce! Is it possible to have too much good stuff on the menu?? Yep! But wait!! As good as everything is, there's one particular side item that wows me almost more than anything else. It's the Israeli salad. Oh my god I could eat it by the bucket full. Such a simple salad but the flavor is a knockout. We love everything about Stephano's especially the fact that's it's only 5 minutes from home.   I know people marry for money, fame & fortune but listen Stephano, I'd marry you based solely on your amazing recipes. Call me.",

Even the gyro bread was old, and although served warm, it cooled quickly and was hard as rocks.   This place was way overpriced for the low quality food that was served.

You can order \"low carb\" meals which omit rice, hummus, or pita bread.  You can also opt for \"double protein\" which I don't recommend. The double protein option is expensive. While it's low carb, it is NOT low calorie. You're better off ordering the standard meal.  Overall, service was good. Indoor seating is ample. The outdoor seating area is nice too. Outside there is a covered picnic type area with a patio cover and shrubbery shielding you from the roadway.  The weekday lunch hour can be busy, but the kitchen is pretty quick. You shouldn't have trouble ordering and receiving your food in a reasonable time period.",
