    "text": "I am definitely NOT a fan of Kabuki. Of all the times I have been to the restaurants in California, I have never once suggested going there on my own. The prior times were because of some sort of event with friends.  Why did I go to the one in Vegas? Well friends that live there wanted to have dinner with the BF and I and they picked Kabuki. I decided to give it try because when you least expect it, things can surprise you. Right? But unfortunately, this time it didn't happen.   I'll give the place props for being the nicest (decor + ambiance) one I've been to. However, I'm still not a fan of the food. I was very disappointed with the sushi yet again. I could get way better and way cheaper at other places. However, I did love their Tokyo Mojito in Lychee flavor. That was pretty delicious. The calamari was decent but I enjoyed it better than the rolls.  The other thing I didn't get was their plates. I mean they really tried to make it all nice and super chic but their humongous heavy frosted glass plates (for a small roll on each) were not working. We were seated at a booth and we BARELY got everything to fit. Someone needed to work on their space management or make the tables bigger.  Back to the positive. One other thing that I liked is that it's located in a pretty shopping area. Much like Victoria Gardens and it was beautiful at night (minus the overhead airplanes landing and taking off). haha  Unless someone absolutely has/wants to go, I won't even think of going back. If I have to, I'll stick to the alcohol and their appetizers.",

I ordered a cold bottle of sake and they bring out 2 room temperature bottles stuffed in crushed ice.  Am I supposed to wait an hour before this gets cold?  Sent that shit back.  Waiter seemed surprised I didn't want it!! They should've just told people they were out of it then.  It took 20 minutes for them to bring a mojito over and then they close down the bar so my wife couldn't even get her 2nd one for a $1.  The waiter never stopped to ask if we needed anything as I always had to hail him down as he was walking by.  Lame.  This was the first time in a long time where I tipped less than 10%...I hope most of it went to the sushi chef.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, potentially even a 4 if the service can improve.   This place doesn't necessarily have the best sushi or traditional Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas, but it's pretty consistent with decent, enjoyable meals, moderate prices, and friendly staff. Most of the menu consists of average, typical Japanese food; however, I must give 5 stars to their Ramen.... they have 3 different kinds: the soy, spicy miso, and the char-sui... and all I can say is WOW. That is officially my meal nearly every time I go because other places in Vegas where it's claimed to have the \"best\" ramen in town (Monta or Anime Ramen), I personally believe are highly overrated!! The ramen in Kabuki in particular is fantastic, and I would prefer it over Monta or Anime's any day.   I like to switch up the appetizers so that there's variety on the table, plus I can try something new every time. Their grilled calamari is yum! I tried some of my friend's seafood salad and it is a generous portion of fresh seafood variety.   The people who work here are VERY nice, but they don't have much serving experience. It is easily seen that they don't know how to multi-task, and they always seem so flustered even when the restaurant isn't very busy. It may take a while for water to be refilled and it is rare for them to check on you during your meal more than once... Perhaps a full, thorough staff training is in order! The positive attitudes and hospitable traits in the staff are definitely there; they just need some pointers in service :)",

This place just happens to have a good location at Town Sqaure.  'Tis a shame that their sushi chefs aren't any better (or maybe it's the ingredients they have to work with?).

This service was so horrible, that I have been so inclined to write my review mid-dining! Seriously, it will take me about 5 - 10 minutes to review this place, the same length of time it took for the server to acknowledge us, then handle 3 other tables that were closing checks, then finally arrive back at our table to take our order. No apologies. That's the stickler...service anywhere should come with manners.  And that was what first alerted me to wanting to review this place. The hostess was the first person we encountered with the lack of mannerism that comes with service. I think it pains her to smile. The poor woman could not even muster up a grin, and a courteous welcome, or even an apology for the wait.  The scene went something like this:  We walk in to an abandoned front counter, wait 2 minutes. Grimace, that's what we'll call her, shows herself and acknowledges us with: \"How many?\" (no greeting, no smile). Then she walks away to sit a previous guest. She then returns and asks us again, \"Did you say for 4?\" (no thank you for the wait, and did I mention NO SMILE?) Then finally, Grimace sits us. Oh yeah, and with her less than 10-word vocabulary, she doesn't bother to realize that we required kids' menus. Weird.  In short, poor customer service here. We will not dine here again. The single star is for the food...it was okay, just okay. You will definitely find better Japanese cuisine elsewhere. People who don't belong in customer service should not be working in this kind of establishment. There are far more people on this earth willing to work on a busy, money-making New Year's Eve with a better attitude. If management can't figure that out, then oh well, they are down one paying patron. Sayonara.",

Totally not worth the price and when I ordered it the other day it seems as if they changed up the ingredient. I don't ever remember them putting crab mix on top. Less scallops, onions and mushrooms. Even the sauce was different.  The miso ramen lost all it's flavor. I ordered one of their newest items, the ebi takoyaki, and that was disgusting as well. I basically ordered $60 of food, took one bite of every thing and was done for. The only thing that tasted decent was the edamame and my oolong tea.",

The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly.   Our waiter didn't really give us the time of day and just shoved menus in our face and not a word after that. He took our food and drink orders and asked us if we cared what came out first. This really made things awkward while eating.   I ordered the jidori chicken ramen, with a spicy tuna roll on the side. The ramen was very bland, I have had more flavor in a cup of noodles. I finally had to ask them to bring Sriracha chili sauce out. The tuna was decent but lacking in the flavor department aswell. My fiance ordered the spicy tuna salad, it was basically a spoon fill of spicy tuna sushi roll filling scooped on a bed of lettuce. Our friends both ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll they said it was decent for the price.   I won't be coming back here even for their decently priced happy hour specials. It's worth a try if you need a sushi fix while wondering town square. I wouldn't travel across town just for the food they offer.",

I ordered two rolls and it ended up coming out to about what it would've if i payed for AYCE somewhere else so i didn't feel as bad as i thought I would after i finished eating.  One of my rolls was a crab roll, but instead of that imitation crab meat, (which I still love) it was fresh king crab meat and absolutely delicious and worth every penny.  I liked that they offered us complementary edamame before we ordered at the sushi bar and I like how attentive our sushi chef was. The only thing I didn't like was when we got there, there were two hosts there to greet us but neither one of them did they had their backs turned to us reading something and when she turned around she told us to wait a moment so they could seat us. There was nobody there...  All in all I will definitely be back. The food was great and besides our greeting the service was too!",

I was worried about them accommodating the dog, but they didn't mind and set us up at one of the outside tables. It was really cold, but they had some outdoor heaters!  We got the salmon yaki onigiri, my friend had the tonkatsu lunch special, and I had the sushi moriawase lunch special, with a Philly Roll substitution. All of it was super yummy and affordable! I was able to buy for both of us for about $30. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the salmon yaki onigiri. It's heaven. All of the food was great quality. Even the rice tasted ridiculously good! I also love that the menu has more variety than most sushi places.  Service was awesome. I think our server's name was Travis. He did a great job!  It was an awesome way to wrap up my last day in Vegas. I'll definitely come back!",

I have not tried the Hibachi but when it comes down to from Appetizers to soups, drinks, main course...Kabuki is the best!  Everything you eat is fresh, the restaurant ambiance is fantastic, the staff is on top of their game, and the servings match the price.  What else could you ask for?  Every place I go, I absolutely measure them up to this restaurant, I'm not kidding.  Perhaps in Japan the competition would be more fierce but here in Las Vegas, Kabuki is doing it right!  I've traveled all around the U.S. and the world and I have to say this is deservingly my favorite spot!!",

The staff greets new customers in Japanese once you enter; a lot of them talk to each other in Japanese, which I thought was really cool just because you're transported into this foreign world in the middle of the Town Square Mall!   Aside from having a pretty nice happy hour, every time I've been to Kabuki and ordered something I don't usually get, it has been a letdown. I ordered from the Vegetarian Menu, Spicy Tofu on Crispy Rice & Vegetable Ramen. It was just okay, the taste of everything was pretty bland. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food is pretty good, but the flavors are nonexistent.   If you plan on eating here, just eat at happy hour!   PS. you can get a discount for being an LVAC member. Slide your membership card in when you pay the bill!   Also, don't worry if you don't finish your soup, they have a To-Go soup container!",

They provide complimentary edamame, which is also a nice touch. I loved the spicy miso ramen! This will be my go to when I go back! But my major disappointment was that I left my leftovers at the table! Nooooooo!!! Guess I'll just have to go back and get more.       The service was fantastic. Brandon was offered good suggestions, never rushed us, and was very attentive. He made sure we knew that happy hour was ending and gave us one last chance to order off the happy hour menu.   There are three sections to Kabuki; the sushi bar, the sake room and the main dining room. We sat in the main dining room which is well appointed that provides a nice environment and ambiance.   And finally, they have a rewards program! Monday's and Tuesday's are double points. There are also specials for your birthday!   If you're craving sushi before your movie, this is your spot!",

That combo is just a disaster waiting to fall apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks.  After eating a few pieces, we finally said something to the waiter.  We even showed her what happens when you pick it up!!! \"Maybe the rice wasn't made correctly?? Or made not tight enough??\"  She looked at us as if we were crazy!  So the best thing she could do for us was to remake \"one roll\" b/c the other rolls were half way eaten.    I'm not sure if was due to the crazy, hectic Valentine's holiday or if that's just the way they make some of their rolls ??  I was so caught up in picking up the sushi in pieces that I lost focus on quality and taste of the fish :/    I've been to many sushi places in town, and I'll have to say - I've had better....",

Alaskan I didn't even finish just wasn't all that great. Then had the Lotus which was California Roll with Cooked lobster on top. Ok Hot and Cook just eh plus the cream sauce with the mix of hot and cold was really wasn't pleasing. Then order the Yaki (Beef on Sticks) eh just no flavor.   Being in Vegas you figure places would step it up cause their are some many places to go. One would think they would put forth the effort to really do something to wow a customer.

Upon arrival we very almost immediately showed to our table. Not only was it in a quiet corner spot as requested but it came prepared with 2 kids menus in addition to regular ones. (Btw - the kids menus are awesome). Needless to say, the kids very happy.  Now the food: once you make those difficult choices on what to order (the menu is HUGE), you'll get excellent food one after the other. The cold noodles (always forget the name) were delicious. The garlic steak terrific. Need to add that the service is top notch. And after all that food - which is plenty - you will like that the check is very reasonable.  To sum it up: one of the best dining experiences we had as a family in a long time. We'll be back and I would recommend this place to anyone in the area.",

Price: 4/5 Lunch specials were all reasonably priced, all $10 - $15.  Kabuki Deluxe: 3.5/5 The Kabuki Deluxe ($13.95) was a super generous portion, with a little bit of everything. The chicken and beef were dry. Everything else was just okay.  Sushi Moriawase: 3.5/5 The Sushi Moriawase ($13.95) looks deceivingly small, but I left full just the same. The fish was dry, but otherwise everything else was okay.  Soft shell crab: 3/5 Super cute presentation. A single soft shell crab on a bed of grilled onions (like half an onion). It wasn't very good though. Eating this cute little soft shell crab was like putting a spoonful of peanut butter in your mouth -- coats your entire mouth with a single flavor (aka onion) and leaves your mouth feeling dry. I've had better at AYCE.   Also, our food didn't come out at the same time, which isn't that big of a deal, but isn't preferred, nam sayin'?   Overall: 3.5/5 I don't know how they managed to coordinate the chicken, beef, raw fish, and fried crab to be dry that day I came, but consider me impressed. The rest of the food was okay, while the service and lunch special prices redeem this place. I don't think this place is bad, I just think it's better when I'm not paying full price.",

The sushi is pretty good! The service is also fast and the staff is very nice/welcoming :) they have yummy side dishes like sweet potato fries which got me! Definitely great for a quick snack. They're not AYCE so don't expect that! I put one less star because i wouldn't go all the way to this sushi place if I ever craved it. It's not like WOWWW sushi but it's pretty good and consistent still! Great for being in the area incase you crave sushi while at Town Square!",

    "text": "****Updated 2/9/18 from 3 stars to 1...reason being the manager that commented on my review told me the excuse for the food not being really tasty is because it's healthy & vegan...wow. No, sorry, dude- but I've been to plenty of vegan restaurants over the years and had amazing healthy flavorful vegan dishes. So not only will I not be trying something off your regular menu, I will now never be coming back. You are very offensive and unprofessional.  I recently had an early dinner here.  I had heard various reviews of their vegan sushi options for a long time and decided I wanted to try it for myself.  The usual sushi place I eat at close to home is a bit pricey and I just wanted to change up the flavors a bit.  Kabuki is a trendy place, busy, buzzing with activity, and since it is in town Square - not as casual as my neighborhood joint.  I did like the selection on their veggie sushi menu.I tried a few items like the tofu and crispy rice and some veggie sushi. While they were creative in the making, the flavors did not knock me off my seat. They were just so -so. So nothing I would crave specifically to drive here in order.  The service was good, the waiter was friendly enough and he made sure we had refills on our drinks. The sushi chefs were not very entertaining, seemed a bit young and not masters at their skill quite yet. That being said, if I happen to be in town square and I'm hungry I would possibly eat at kabuki again. But I certainly wouldn't drive out of my way to come eat here.",

The service and attention we got during lunch was attentive and efficient. We started off with the Calamari and Roasted Brussel Sprouts, then wrapped it up with an Albacore Roll and Sunkissed Roll.  All of which were delicious.  Each dish offering a flavor that really lights up your taste buds.  It's in a great location near Yogurtland and AMC theatres at town square.  If you're a sushi  connoisseur like myself, you will certainly enjoy the selection of rolls and the ambiance.  Great job to Hoon and the team at Kabuki for running a great establishment.",

The sushi is delicious and I appreciate the fact it's possible to have brown rice instead of white rice, if desired, or have soy paper instead of seaweed. If only they would bring back their amazing Tempura Rock Shrimp appetizer again, life would be perfect. Highly recommend",

I ordered the Kabuki Roll.  It's one of the rolls that I haven't had yet so I figured it was the signature one that they are proud of...  horrible.  The only fish of the roll was on the top, which looked appetizing.  BUT Inside was that crunchy filler type of stuff that almost taste like styrofoam and rice.  The seaweed salad was good, but never getting that roll again.  I was starving.",

There are a ton of other places in town where I can get my AYCE sushi fix.   My all time favorite love here is their spicy tuna salad. Fresh spring mix dressed with a soy vinagarette and topped with a giant ball of spicy tuna. Broiled mussels on a half shell are drenched in sweet, rich mayo sauce are also good. The fried calamari rings come with two types of dipping sauces, teriyaki or creamy mustard. Fried sesame chicken bites also come with a teriyaki dipping sauce. Can't go wrong with a Philadelphia roll or any other simple roll like salmon skin. Their specialty rolls have too much going on for my taste so I stay away from them. Lastly you gotta try the cucumber mint mojito or two or three. Sake is pretty cheap for happy hour price too. I always leave here feeling overly stuffed with fried, fatty goodness.",

Had fun, and the servers seemed to work well together . A good Saturday date night . Spicy tuna crispy rice was on point as well as other dishes ! Wish I got the name of our server because he was friendly, and professional to us. Also, the hostess was super sweet . Allison I think was her name. Sending thank you's your way Kabuki !",

    "text": "sushiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!   So I've come here a couple times and so far I've had a really good experience. The first time I sat at the bar and we ordered a couple rolls and some drinks. My favorite roll was the baja. It's a little spicy but so yummy. It's a spicy crab roll with a tomato salsa on top. My go to is always avocado roll. It's just simple and good and makes me happy. I've also tried the AAA box roll. It had good ingredients but when picking it up it would fall completely apart. Not so much fun. We had a couple other rolls the first time I went but nothing that stuck out at me. I went a second time with a group of friends. We grab a table and ordered our favorites to share. My friend Paris and Sam do this cute weird thing where they eat their first and last piece together... AWWW!! But that is besides the point. Paris ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll and a lotus on fire. Both were amazing. She even ate the flower. I'm a huge fan of crunch so anything with tempura crumbs is a win. My friend Theresa ordered her favorite. She got the dragon roll. It came out and I was in such awe I forgot to take a picture. It looked just like a dragon!! It also tasted like chicken. Very good. The most talked about was the Kabuki roll. Sam ordered this and had it mostly to her self, however I did try one of the orange egg looking things.. It was weird. Not my thing. My baja roll for this trip came out last and I though it would be a good idea to just stuff my face. I however did not chew the roll all the way and almost died. I had to step outside and spit out the roll before I choked. The pieces I ate after that we chew thoroughly. Kabuki has been good to me so far (aside from almost dying). Paris ended our meal by eating the flower from my bay breeze. What a crazy gal.",

They explained that's how they receive it from supplier. They gave me 10 percent off. Wow! Told them they can keep their discount and tipped more than usual. Looking at \"ribs\" made me sick as the meal went meal time went on. Never again. Pics attached.",

Wish it was a little more tender, but the flavor was good.  Looks like pork belly, but it isn't as fatty or tender as belly.  Omakase Deluxe ($13.95): Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Albacore & Spicy Tuna Roll. SURPRISINGLY GOOD quality nigiri here! I didn't think this would fill me up, but with the appetizers and sides, I left stuffed.    I would come here again if I am hungry in Town Square :)",

My friend got a salmon fillet for her daughter and they were super accommodating in terms of helping her find a dish for her picky eater and keeping the sauces and everything on the side. So that was nice. I got a water and the waiter refilled it like 50 times because I just kept drinking like I have never had water before. But that was nice, my glass never got empty or stayed empty for longer than a minute or two.  For our meal we shared some sushi rolls; the spicy tuna, spicy tuna crunch, halibut shashimi, and this other one with avocado on top & tuna inside (can't remember the name). We also got miso soups and then strawberry mochis; we had an uneven amount and they brought us a fourth one on the house-mango! The presentation was nice and everything tasted good. I enjoyed my meal and it wasn't too loud and the wait time wasn't noticeable. The only thing- I thought my friend ordered a caterpillar roll, but it never came. They didn't say anything though, and they were buying, so I didn't mention it but also I could have misheard that. Oh well. This is like a high 4.5 for me; there just wasn't anything that really wowed me, but I wouldn't mind coming back because it was a good experience.",

Cuts of fish were a bit anemic (but the price was pretty low, so overall this was a reasonable balance).  The real standout (surprising to me, at least) was the Tonkatsu Ramen. Broth was flavorful and not overly salted - as is the case at many places. The pork was relatively thick and was tender and delicious.   Would definitely return. Strongest recommendation for the ramen!",

This includes their Tokyo steam pork buns and the dynamite appetizer. The experience was simple with good service. The place was a bit cramped because every rolls gets served on a different large white plate. I think they need to consolidate some rolls because I felt like I was playing Tetris with my table space.  Anyways, aside from the space hurdle, everything was pleasant.

I came here with some friends for dinner Saturday night and ordered salmon with teriyaki sauce on the side and avocado rolls with brown rice instead of white. Only 2 modifications. Not too complicated right???  Yes! It was complicated. I got my rolls with white rice instead of white so the waitress ended up taking it back and we had to wait another 10 minutes.  Then my salmon came slathered in teriyaki sauce and it looked like they added more when I clearly stated sauce on the side.  What made this more frustrating is that every time the waitress came she kept saying 'I told the kitchen, but they messed up'.   My question is that you are the one taking the order and should be looking at the dish before you bring it out to your table. That is the correct way of handling things... not complaining to your table that it's not your fault.   Please take responsibility for your part in servicing your table. I've worked in the food industry before and this is just unacceptable.   Long story short I probably will not make my way back here again. Not only because of this poor experience, but because the other location at Tivoli Village has also dropped the ball.  I know for a fact I can find a better Sushi place in Vegas. This use to be my favorite Sushi joint, but not any more... so disappointing.",

I was pleasantly surprised to find out they have a brand new vegaterian and gluten free menu.   I had the tomato,  mushroom and tofu sushi and it was Delish.    The seaweed salad was also a generous portion size.   The service was good.  Prices were good if you can go at happy hr you can get a Veggie roll for 3$ and there is a large selection.   My only. Complaint is The bathroom definitely needs a clean.",

I had the worst service/servicer, I've ever experienced. Granted he was new & I don't want to throw him under the bus sorta speak but, he made me anxious & I think it's irresponsible of management to let him on the floor, knowing he's untrained. The server came back six different times just to ask me about my chicken and albacore dish I ordered & he still got it wrong? So, all and all I had an expensive bill, poor service & crappy food. They'll never take me for my money again!!!! You want good sushi go to sushi 21! Now, there's service & fresh sushi that's kept me coming back for years! Don't know why I decided to cheat on them that day (4-20-2017) lesson learned",

I even went for two, maybe three.... Lol  Food in general was excellent. Portion sizes are on the larger side. I started with the Tokyo quesadilla. (An Asian version of the original) and to my surprise it was very good.  Then a selection of several rolls followed. Particularly recommend the Vegas roll, and spicy tuna.  Service in general good and location very nicely decorated. One odd feature \"pretty weird sperm looking lamps at the bar\" a bit distracting actually. Haha",

We waited about 20 minutes around 740pm. We were given a booth which can fit up to 6 people except that the booths are not made for bigger people. We ordered a bunch of food and also drinks. We mostly ordered sushi items which were all very good. I think our favorite was the grilled shrimp roll. We ordered another one of those at the end. The service was on point. Our teas were refilled and she checked on us enough. The menu is very nice and easy to read with a lot of photos. They offer an extensive selection, appetizers, rolls, sashimi, soup noodles, etc. I can see why this place is popular.   A good place to meet up with some friends. We were here for about 2.5 hours, basically until closing. It wasn't too loud.",

    "text": "A group of ten of us went out to Kabuki while in Las Vegas on Friday evening.  We got a bit lost trying to find the restaurant in the area as we ended up on the wrong side of the shops/restaurants.  We were able to get almost immediate seating, and we had very attentive wait staff.  They brought complimentary edamame as we awaited our main courses to arrive.  While food took a little while to arrive, it makes sense as we ordered A LOT of food.    I was the only non-sushi eater among the group so I was very happy with the teriyaki chicken/BBQ beef ribs combo dinner with salad, rice, and soup.  My friends all ordered sushi dishes (including two HUGE boats for $55 each), sake, and various appetizers.  All in all, we enjoyed our dishes and had no regrets on what we ordered except for how much food we ate.

It's not difficult to mess up a California roll and they did it. The chicken and beef teriyaki we're pretty good. The beef was surprisingly tender, but both were drowning in sauce. The tempura was okay not overly covered in batter and it was crispy. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was disappointing. The crispy rice was too thick so it wasn't that crispy and the spicy tuna was just okay.  I'm more disappointed with the service than anything. We we're hardly checked on and when we did ask another employee for something (requested 2 forks) they completely forgot and neglected to say anything. They could've at least told our waitress. So it was another 5 minutes of trying to flag someone down to get a fork.  It was my first time here and will probably be the last. Mediocre Japanese food, service low to sub-par.",

There was a special for a squash soup outside and with the weather cooling down, I thought soup would be great. I was greeted right away and offered if I wanted to sit at the sushi table or bar. I went with the sushi table which are low set tables by the bar. Cozy and clean. Ordered the Albacore and Sunkissed roll and the Winter squash soup. The rolls were tasty, but average. The only thing that stood out to me was that the Sunkissed roll was a little spicy, but not much else. The squash soup was the highlight. It was creamy, rich and had a hint of paprika for heat. Maybe it just paired well with the cold weather outside, but I hope they make it a staple item in their menu. The hot tea was also decent.  The server was attentive and engaging. Checked on my drink levels and made sure everything was ok. I would come back for the friendly service and the soup for sure.",

The menu is vast and offers numerous sushimi and sushi rolls -- including two full pages of specialty rolls (8 pieces). The service is great; very kind and swift. They bring you a free bowl of edameme, too! Winning... and they had $4 Japanese bar on draft, which was much better than your run of the mill Bud Light or Miller Lite.  OK, the good stuff: the sushi. We all got it. I opted for the scallop roll (6 pieces), and it was awesome. The scallops are huge! It was mixed with cream cheese and really hit the spot. The best part was the lava roll: salmon, cream cheese, spicy tuna, deep-fried jalapeno, sweet sambal sauce. One of THE BEST sushi rolls I ever had. The \"lava\" is actually in the middle of the rolls, so forget the soy sauce and douse them in the sambal sauce. The jalapenos add flavor, but the sweet sauce makes it so it's not spicy. Highly recommend.  All in all the place is intimate, has dim lighting, some TVs by the sushi bar, lots of seating and is in a nice location off the strip. Glad I tried it on my travels.",

Within is where all it's jewels are hidden!  Interior decor is calming to the eye. A quiet ambience fills the room, and tables are very spacious. Lots of utensils to use as well!  Food is tasty and fresh! Ingredient quality is high, and the portions are plentiful. I ordered a lunch special which included Miso Soup, Salad, and my entree. My server was nice as well. Good customer service goes a long way.  I didn't use the restroom therefore I can't comment on it. Although the rest of the restaurant was clean! My table wasn't sticky, A+++.  I noticed an outdoor area, although I didn't notice if there were bike racks nearby. No WiFi that my phone could pick up.  Overall, fun and pleasant place to grab a bite on a special or casual eating opportunity. Good jobs guys!",

They cut the shell in half, so I didn't have to crack anything open, and they were fabulously flavored with butter and (not spicy) spices. Perfect size for my extra small new stomach. My husband is not the biggest sushi fan, but he got the Vegas roll and it was the best he's ever had. Complimentary edamame was a nice touch. Best of all, this place is super affordable, and we didn't have to wait forever for our food! Two people ate for about $35, and the service is most excellent. Would recommend!",

I immediately called them up and was asked to wait, it wasn\"t a short wait and almost gave up waiting. Then maybe the Supervisor or Manager was the one on the phone and I told him what the problem was. I told him the problem and he got some information and said he would call back. It is Tuesday today and still no call.  If I could give them a zero I would for Customer Service!",

I really didn't like the tako that much but the other 2 rolls are really good. I loved the peach iced tea. Definitely should try out that one.  The price is pretty decent not too expensive even tho it's located inside town square. The service was on point when my server constantly would check up on me. Seeing if I'm ok or not! The place is pretty fancy, comes with a cute little lighted candles, would be romantic for a date.  The only negative thing would be, the hot stone grill bbq thing. It was $24.95 for one order( keep in mind you gotta wait for 20-30 mins for the hot stone thing to be ready) and we thought it would be a big order but turn out it only like 10 pieces of meat in there. Has no flavor either. Which was a disappointment for me. If you love grill BBQ, might as well go to ayce kbbq instead of ordering this. Bc w/ 24.95 you could afford a whole new ayce. Other than that, everything is good so far. Will be back.",

They do cut their sushi into larger pieces, so its 6 instead of 8 pieces like everywhere else.  Waiter dropped off free Edamame in which we gobbled down.  The only thing we did not like and it wasn't because the flavor, was the Sesame Chicken appetizer.  The chicken used in this particular dish was stringy, chewy and probably dark meat.  The flavor was still good, but the quality of the chicken was bad.  I will have to check out the location in Tempe, AZ.",

    "text": "Great location! Nice interior and exterior decorations. Reverse Happy Hour.  That pretty much covers the major highlights of Kabuki Japanese restaurant. The food served is okay to good, price is average, service is prompt and pleasant.  And even for weekday lunches, the place is still pretty busy (the restaurant has roughly 50% of their tables occupied). The fact that it is located conveniently near the Rave Motion Pictures, a plethora of shopping and other restaurants and bars undoubtedly contributed to the ongoing success of this national restaurant outpost.  If you are in the vicinity of Town Square and in the mood for some Japanese food before resuming your hunt for that perfect little black dress or that movie to start, I would totally recommend Kabuki.  Especially from 3-6pm on Monday to Friday (their regular happy hour), or their lunch hour (11am to 4pm daily).  Kabuki is also a great place to grab a bite before spending the rest of the evening getting your beer goggles on.  The reverse HH from 9pm until close (Monday-Thursday) and 8pm until close on Sundays makes Kabuki a happy place to start the evening.  The B.B.Q. Beef Ribs (Kalbi) is excellent here. Even though the portion is not particularly generous, the flavor and how it is grilled perfectly makes up for that. Many of the sauces that accompanies the appetizers and entrees are tasty and compliments the overall dish.  The only item I would avoid is the tempura, as it looks like it was overfried and on the greasy side.  Location:  5/5 Love it!  If you regularly hang out in the southern portion of Las Vegas, this will be a convenient location for you.  It is not too far from Mandalay Bay, so if you are visiting Las Vegas and on that end of the Strip, it will not be too far to travel via a cab.  Service:  4/5  Prompt service, friendly staff.  Ambiance:  4/5  The bar area looks nice, the rest of the restaurant has a coherent theme to the design and decor.  Price:  3/5  Average for non-AYCE Japanese restaurants.  Food:  3.5/5  Tasty, but otherwise average for Japanese restaurants.",

On the weekends, waits are generally short.  The regular prices are reasonable, and the happy hour prices are a steal. This is one of my top three favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.

    "text": "Located across H&M and Yogurtland, this restaurant is a great pitstop while shopping at Town Square.  Nice ambiance and superb customer service.  Make sure to call ahead especially on weekends to avoid the long wait.  Can't really remember the last time I dined at this place before this one.  First thing I noticed was the newly upgraded menu for 2014.  One of the standouts was the 'ankimo' (steamed monkfish liver on ponzu sauce and topped with spicy radish).  Considering of never having eaten fish liver before, I had to give this item a try.  Surprisingly, the flavor wasn't as irony as chicken liver or foie that one would expect.  In fact, it had a faint fishy taste but enough to remind you're eating fish entrails.   Other items on the new menu that seemed enticing include soy tako ebitaki (soy paper wrapped and lightly fried octopus and shrimp, topped with bonito flakes), spicy tuna on crispy rice and takosu (sliced octopus marinated in Japanese vinaigrette).  The restaurant also offers an extensive gluten-free and vegetarian menu.  Overall, Kabuki is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area.  Best time to check this place out is during Happy Hour which runs Mondays thru Fridays 3PM-6PM for great deals on food and alcoholic beverages.  They even have Reverse Happy Hour Mondays thru Thursdays 9PM-close and Sundays 8PM-close to pregame with your buddies before heading to one of the bars around the area.",

I have been to many of sushi spots in The Bay Area & Las Vegas and I had no idea the beauty that is the Dragon Roll could get any better than I thought it already was, but this place, it's like an orgy of flavors in your mouth. Flavorful and unspoiled by tempura as some Dragon Rolls are, this is truly a dream. Each time I have a craving, I reminisce my wonderful experience at Kabuki.

So long that by the time she did... We knew everything we were going to order and some. Seems like there was a possible miscommunication on their behalf and maybe she didn't know she had a new table. Service during our meal was good though and she even came and gave us a last call for the kitchen. After all our  plates were licked clean, we watched as they cleaned tables and our check was no where to be found. I had to stop her in the middle of her cleaning to ask for it.   Food was great though. We ordered Kenny of small plates to share.",

This is a great spot for people that love sushi or people that prefer standard options like chicken teriyaki.    We started with the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice. The taste was outstanding. I love the blend of the spicy tuna and jalapeno with slightly sweet, crispy rice. It was stacked high which made it hard to eat, but the taste trumped. the difficulty in eating.   For my entree I had Kabuki Deluxe Lunch special. This is basically a combination of awesome. It starts with a soup that is forgettable, but everything that comes after is delicious. The entree included beef ribs, chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, California roll, and tempura vegetables. There is no shortage of food with this combination. Everything on the plate was great. I'm torn between declaring the tempura vegetables or the beef ribs my favorite.   This is definitely going on my list of regular lunch spots. I know where I'll ask to go for my next work lunch.",

I have celiacs disease and could get very sick from this. Fortunately I bit into it and noticed immediately. Took almost an hour to get our incomplete order, and we still haven't seen the easiest piece of our order. Very upset about this. When you tell someone you have a disease and they don't take your safety seriously, I find it to be a serious disappointment. The manager Hoon was nice but it won't keep me from getting ill :(",

There are plenty of big booths and tables for seating. There's a bar to your right when you walk in where we usually sit. The bartenders are all incredibly friendly and attentive to our needs. We've  had Jeff a few times and he is phenomenal. We get serviced just moments after we sit down.   Happy hour has quite a few items to choose from and the prices range from $4 rolls to $7 apps. I usually eat light here for happy hour and come mainly to enjoy their ki bombs. I've ordered the broiled mussels, seaweed salad, fire cracker, and a few of their rolls. They have $6 ki bombs (draft Saporro and hot sake) which is always a must when I come here. Who doesn't love good ol' sake bombs?!  I've also had their chicken yakitori, tuna poke, sashimi salad, soy ramen, and a few other dishes. The food here is okay but I wouldn't recommend Kabuki for the best sushi and Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas. I would recommend to stop by for happy hour if you're in Town Square and craving some sake! It's located in Town Square where I go frequently and I'm never disappointed with the service. I'll be back this month!",

    "text": "Kabuki is a fairly decent sushi spot located in the west part of Town Square across from the H & M.   As far as taste and value are concerned, you can get your sushi craving satisfied without breaking the bank.  Most of the standard rolls such as spicy tuna, California, yellowtail, Philly roll, etc. are around $5.  The rolls were not bad for the price and they did not skimp on the filling inside the rice.  However, their B.S.C.R. (baked scallop California roll) sounded better than it actually tasted.  Like what some other Yelpers whose culinary opinions I respect have said, the service is what brings this place down a notch.  Having to ask two or three times for an extra fork and spoon should never be a diner's problem.   Finding our server was often times a real life \"where's Waldo\" challenge.    Following dinner, a request for the check and a to-go box was handled at a snail's pace.  We received the check, but could not find our server, or any other for that matter, to pick up my credit card.   After finally being able to pay, a second reminder to our server was the 'hint-hint' she needed to hand us a to-go box.   We packed our extra food (non-sushi items) and headed out quickly.  In a town full of sushi spots, go elsewhere.  When you are in Town Square though, go here to enjoy some decent sushi.  Just be prepared to wait an extended period of time at all phases of your dining experience.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 15/100",

We were very pleased. Only thing we should have done was to ask for soy sauce packets. Other than that I highly recommend their party platters.",

    "text": "I stumbled into this place while shopping in town square around christmas time with my boyfriend. Being from hawaii, I am definitely not used to the cold so I went in here looking for some soup or ramen. I found some and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I also tried one of those big boats (Can't remember what it was called but it was the larger of the two) Everything on the boat was delicious except the chicken. It had sort of a bitter burnt taste. Not sure if that's what they were going for and I'm not accustomed to it or they made a mistake. I did appreciate the speed of service we received though. Our waitress came by frequently to ask how we were doing and to refill our drinks. That was definitely nice since she was pretty busy. I've never had trouble finding parking for this place and never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a table. Very reasonable. One star off because, while it is a nice romantic setting, the lighting in there was way too dim to read the menu. I'm in my 20's and my eyesight is fine but I don't think it would hurt to turn the lights over the tables up a little bit.",

However, my fried had a crappy day at work and wanted to get some cocktails and sushi so she suggested Kabuki's at Town Square.  I met her there, and she had waiting I think 15 minutes or so for a table.  Our server, Justin, was very attentive and friendly, giving us time to read over the menus and decide what we wanted.  We went with the yellowtail carpaccio to start and it was delicious!  I loved the sauce. Next up was the Baja roll which was a spicy California roll topped with tomato salsa. Sounds really crazy, but it was really really good!  I'm not a huge fan of crab, but it was very tasty and different.  Finally we ordered the lotus on fire roll and it was good. I was hoping to get the spicy tuna crunch roll, but maybe next time.  I'd definitely eat here again if I'm in the area and hungry.",

Very interesting and tasty twist on the spicy scallop handroll (my favorite), nice little sesame vibe, no mayo, and a perfect level of spice (tingle on the lips without full on tears).  Salmon skin roll and albacore were both good, and the unagi was surprisingly awesome (right off the broiler too, none of that cold mushy stuff they give you sometimes).  Spicy tuna wasn't spicy enough but still good fish.  Sushi chefs were great - the yellowtail was the chef's personal favorite and while ordinarily not something I eat, this stuff was YUM.  Finished off with the tempura red bean ice cream - good but I think I like red bean mochi better.  But still a nice ending.  Lemon drop cocktail was good as well. Only surprise?  No sunomono on the menu, boooo.  But if I am ever in Vegas again (which I doubt as I am not a fan, just here on business), I'll definitely be back.  PS - Northwesterners, be prepared for exorbitant prices.  Like SoCal, sushi is massively overpriced so don't be surprised if dinner for two is $100+.",

Atmosphere is warm and trendy and is why I often prefer Kabuki to other places in the area.  Comfy private booths, tables, sushi bar, and an outdoor patio.  Usually crowded from happy hour (great specials) to closing, but I've never had to wait more than 10-15 mins.  Extensive cocktail menu, decent wine selection and several flavored non-alcoholic drinks including sweet mango iced tea and mint lemonade.  Edamame comes with all sushi orders.  Good miso soup and house salad with ginger dressing, decent seaweed salad but not my fav.  Lots of apps, including fried eggplant and calamari.  Large selection of specialty sushi rolls, fav is the Lotus on Fire roll (spicy tuna, jalapeno and lotus root on california rolls).  Extensive menu with lots of pictures, and lots of non-sushi items including teriyaki, noodle dishes, soups, seafood, etc.  Fresh fish, great service & atmosphere!",

For the items they do have on happy hour are excellent and filling, but would also like to see a couple more options sushi wise added.  Service is lively and friendly, though there was one server we had not too long ago who was aloof and not open to passing conversation, but besides from that guy everything was great!  The only con I would say is their happy hour drink menu; all three times we've went there to order drinks off the menu, they either made them too sweet or prepared the wrong one. Servers don't seem very familiarized with drinks in their restaurant, that could be something they should work on.   I love to go there for the happy hour only, it's a great deal and you get stuffed for the amount you get. However, I wouldn't eat there if happy hour isn't going on. Everything else on the menu is otherwise overly priced for being a sushi bar on the strip. :)",

We were by a service well, which didn't bother me too much, but the manager kept micromanaging and riding their servers, especially ours. It was totally unprofessional and annoying. I almost said something but didn't want it to come down negatively on our server.",

    "text": "I LOVE KABUKI. I would go during happy hour, lunch or dinner. My husband and I go to here quite often, mostly for lunch or happy hour. I love Town Square - what a great location for a restaurant like this. They have a great lunch menu with reasonable prices for the quality of food you receive. One of my favorite parts? THEY ARE GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!!!  On the bottom of the menu they state that they offer gluten free soy sauce and brown rice. I like brown rice better than white and since I'm gluten free, this is a definite plus. This means their staff is somewhat knowledgeable about gluten allergies. finding that at a sushi restaurant. I normally get one of their nigiri and sushi specials at lunch, brown rice, no wasabi (I am not sure if it is GF and not worth the risk), with just a hit of gluten free soy sauce and maybe a little ginger. Delicious. Of course, I cannot get any of those fancy rolls that are fried and dripping in calories, but that's okay! The fish I can have is fresh, delicious, not stinky and totally fulfilling in every way. Wash it down with a sake and you're good to go!  My husband gets the teriyaki chicken and tempura lunch special every time we go. He loves the tempura because it isn't too greasy, just a right amount of crunch and perfectly cooked every time. The teriyaki chicken is his favorite because it isn't too sweet, isn't drowned in too much sauce and is once again, perfectly cooked. It comes with a bowl of miso soup and a bowl of rice, so by the end of the meal he is absolutely full, and to get a 6' 7\" man full in one sitting with one plate without making him want to vomit due to MSG overload? Good times.  Come during any hour, but a lot of people love happy hour at Kabuki. Great roll specials and appetizer specials, but I'm a big fan of the large hot sake for $3. After a long day, it's nice to wind down with a large sake and a spicy tuna roll. The prices are great, service is consistently good and I love the location and ambiance. All around, this place is delicious and perfect any time of the day.",

It is normally pretty busy on weekends and if you go to eat between 8-9p.m. you can expect to wait from 10-20 minutes on average. The food is reasonably priced, atmosphere is decent and the noise level is such that you can talk across the table without raising your voice or practically yelling. I usually get one of the combination dinners and my wife gets sashimi. The food is always good and I will say except for once the service has been excellent. It's one of our favorite places to go that has been consistent with service & food quality with reasonable prices. I would give Kabuki Japanese Restaurant 4.5 stars!",

    "text": "Okay, I admit, I was hesitant at first with the idea of hitting up Kabuki.  But since I've been making my rounds for happy hour, I was told that I have to check this place out!  Their happy hour is Monday through Friday, from 3 pm to 6 pm; includes discounted drinks and food.  Drinks are hard to miss on their menu because it dominates the first few pages.  I started off with:  * Tokyo Mojitos \"Made from Asian Vodka \"Shochu\" and Sake\" (HH $4.95 / $7.95 reg), the Berry flavor.  When I took a sip, oh my goodness, wow!  This was one damn good mojito!  I had the Husband and another friend try it, and they were sold immediately!  The Husband got the Grapefruit variety, while our friend got a Berry one too.  I also tried the Lychee one later on.  I'm not usually a fan of fresh grapefruit, but it reminded me more of grapefruit soda and I liked it too, better than the Lychee one.  * Draft beer (Kirin Ichiban) (HH $1.95 / reg $3.50) - The guys did get beer to start, but soon moved on to mojitos!  I had planned on trying one of their Chu-Hi \"Made from Asian Vodka 'Shochu' with Refreshing Fruit Flavor\" drinks, specifically the Blueberry flavor (HH $4.95 / reg $6.95), but got stuck on the mojitos!  Oh well, next time!  Foodwise:  I had to ask first, do they use sriracha in their hot sauce?  (I'm not a fan of it in my sushi.)  And thank goodness, no!  I was all aboard!  * Spicy Tuna Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $4.75) - My staple, as long as I like the hot sauce and I like it here.  Yum.  * Lotus on Fire Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Lotus Root, and Jalapeno on top of California roll\" (HH $5.95 / reg $9.95) - This was beautifully presented with a deep-fried lotus root sitting on each piece, complete with a jalapeno slice.  There's also some spicy crunchy things on one side and more hot sauce on the other side.  It's a pretty tasty roll with a lot of heat, so good that we ordered another roll!  * Salmon Skin Roll (HH $2.95 / reg $3.95) - Served with six pieces, the bonito flakes add a nice smokey taste to it.  It was good.  * Aladdin Roll \"Spicy Albacore and Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura\" (HH $5.95 / reg $7.95) - Another tasty roll with a bit less heat and a nice subtle crunch from the masago.  * Rose Roll (HH $5.95 / reg $8.95) \"Lightly Battered Shrimp Tempura, A-Grade Avocado and Spicy Tuna\" - We're all liking the spicy tuna, so how could this go wrong?  Overall, we were all pleasantly surprised with the drinks and food offered, even at the happy hour.  Service was good, our waitress Briana, was always checking up on us and making sure we had enough food and drink.  We'd definitely go back for more happy hour action now!  They also have a Red Mask Club so you can earn points when you dine.",

When we asked to return the dish she will resist and was angry at us, its service has become a nightmare, we end it replaced the dish and gave us the expense of the middle of the food, hinted that it is better for us to go. I went to sea again and the kids have tumbled down again, again a mistake on demand. Told us no choice eaten the mistake that was ordered and no chance to replace the dish. I ruined the meal I felt like crying. We have a restaurant chain and I'm stunned that there is such behavior on the part of a waitress. Shay end day customer is always right and he should come out with a smile and happy even if a mistake was made to order if it's on his part or on the part waitress is supposed to serve them on the bottom line.

We arrived about an hour before HH started, so we decided \"hey lets wait an hour to get 1/2 off!\"  An hour passes and we stroll in and ask about their happy hour and they told us that there isn't a happy hour today because apparently Father's day is a national holiday and there is NO happy hour on national holidays!  Geez thanks for advertising it with a huge freakin sign outside.... We still decide to eat here because we're starving by now and ordered some food.  We got the ribs and some yakisoba.  The ribs were pretty tasty, but kinda chewy and fatty.  The yakisoba was wayyy too salty for me. We noticed our ribs didn't come with rice so we asked them where it was.  The waiter told us that we didn't order the meal when clearly we did because he gave us soup and salad before...  We told him this and he still refused to give us rice unless we paid extra.... Just a mixture of the False advertisement and charging us for rice ruined my meal just a tad.  The food was ookay, but not memorable.  Probably not coming back here for a while.",

Both times we have sat at the sushi bar so service is really a non-issue since we deal with the sushi chef directly.  At Town Square in Las Vegas, so if you are looking to eat sushi in between the shopping, this will be a good place for you.",

Some people are not used to Japanese food, plus they're happy--they're on vacation! But for serious Japanese food, so many options off the beaten track are available to you if you live here (or have a car and an adventurous spirit, o ye tourist).  The prices are super expensive, too.  It was a one-off for us, for sure.  I do think if it weren't for the influx of one-timers (visiting Town Square), this place would go the way of their other location in Summerlin, which went the way of the Samurais a while ago.  See \"Philip T's\" review (2009), and you'll get it.",

Ambiance was casual, but definitely has a Japanese atmosphere going on.  We had a tiger roll to start with, which was super tasty. The spicy tuna on top could have been a little more spicy but the taste was still there.  For my entree I got the tempura udon. One of the best udon I've had in a while. It was a pretty generous portion and I somehow managed to finish most of it myself! I liked that the tempura was served on the side with dipping sauce. Some places place the tempura inside the udon and ends up being soggy by the time it's served.   The entree also came with a small salad, which also tasted like home with the oriental salad dressing. Yummy!   Next time, I would like to come back for happy hour!",

    "text": "Well designed Japanese restaurant with reasonable price and perfect location. They were located right next to H&M and Yogurtland in the town square. I walked pass it a lot but never really tried it. Due to my friend's recommendation, I decided to came here on my day off.  Design: The chairs and tables are made of woods, the light is semi dark semi light.  Service: The host was very friendly, he said hi to me the second I walked in and took me to my seat. My waiter was so nice and patient too, he answered all my questions and provided a kid menu for my friend's girl.   Appetizer:  Garlic edamame: they fried the garlic a little bit crispy and put the salt on top of the edamame, you are able to enjoy the crunchy flavor.  Seaweed Salad: seaweed salad pretty much taste the same anywhere, they put some veggie leafs underneath the seaweed salad.  Mixed tempura: I definitely love the tempura here, it doesn't give you those over fried disgusting oily taste. They lightly coated with the flour and deep fried it, so you can still taste the flavor of veggie and shrimp pretty well.  Sushi: Spider roll: very nice presentation, but not impressed by the taste. The roll has soft shell crabs and crab meat.  California roll: personally I'm not a big fan of California roll, because I think it's too plain and simple. However, the California roll here is different, the freshness of crab meat and the cream cheese match so well together.   Other: BBQ Beef ribs: the beef taste so tender, the sauce they use goes so well with the beef. I would order again if I come back.",

I mean a deep cleaning needs to be performed.  Management needs to put hands on this if they want to keep the restaurant competitive with the other choices we have in town square.   What concerns me is the overall look of the restaurant in the last 6+ months and not positive changes about it.  Some  of the seats are getting ripped  being taped to keep them in place ??? The bottom of the seats looked very dirty as well of the end of the tables.  The paper that covers the glass in women restroom if falling apart ??? The hook for your purse in the women restroom is missing. All these things make me think how well maintained is the kitchen area?  Attaching some pictures to my feedback",

    "text": "My go-to happy hour hot spot, located south of the strip in Town Square. It's conveniently located next door to Yogurtland, so save room for dessert!   PROS: Location, happy hour, pricing, rewards program and ambiance. Another huge plus for me is the fact that they always have brown rice as an option. No matter where you live, it's easy to justify making a trip to Town Square. You can knock out your Sephora must-have purchases, explore the latest Apple technologies, grab a bite to eat with a friend and finish with your laser hair removal appointment, all in one trip. So after you stuff your face with savory sushi rolls, you can walk around and burn a few calories afterwards. #winning  CONS: Although they have a good happy hour, it's super convenient and not too expensive, I prefer \"I Love Sushi\" or \"Spicy Tuna\" in Henderson as far as taste and freshness. Also, they close at 10pm Sunday - Thursday and 10:30pm on Friday's & Saturday's, which might be a bummer for those who get late night sushi cravings.   HELPFUL TIP(S): Sign up for the reward card if you plan on being a regular sushi goer here. They will send you a free $15 digital gift card for your birthday month and $25 each time you reach 500 points (i.e. spend $500 dollars).   ~ Happy Hour Times ~ Mon - Thurs: 3pm - 6pm & 9pm - 10pm Fri: 3pm - 6pm Sat: N/A Sun: 8pm - 10pm",

It starts at 4, ends at 6, I believe.   Anyways, I ordered an entree: Teriyaki Chicken and it automatically comes with miso soup, rice and a salad. Big portions! I wasn't expecting so much food! The teriyaki was hot and deliciously juicy! I loved the salad and the rice was cooked to perfection. The miso soup wasn't memorable, I've had better but with everything else I got, it didn't matter.   I also got California rolls, which is one of the best Cali rolls I've ever had!!!   Honey bear got a Vegas roll, and he absolutely loved it!!!! He also ordered a Long Island ice tea, which he also enjoyed!  The staff is extremely friendly, though I don't remember our server's name! But he checked on us a couple of times, and made sure our drinks were full.   I love the feel of the place. We got seated in a very fun spot, facing the sushi makers! It has a very modern, edgy feel while still keeping a calm ambience.   I can't wait until I'm back in Vegas to eat here again!",

As for the experience, we had some students selling candy come up and pester our table.

    "text": "Kabuki just might be the restaurant that makes me quit trying new places because they happen to be in the area where I'm running errands (I've had terrible luck with this lately), but that's how a friend and I found ourselves there after doing some shopping in Town Square.  Service issues abound. When we walked in, the host was on the phone. So we waited. And waited. Finally, rather than get off the phone, he just handed us menus and told us to seat ourselves. Seriously? We were not sure we should actually just seat ourselves at a random table in the dining room, so we carried our menus like vagabonds and headed over to the sushi bar.   The food wasn't necessarily terrible; just mediocre and stinking of a lack of execution and effort. The \"Niku Kushiyaki\" was tough and way too salty, nothing like the tender, well-marinated version you'd find in authentic Japanese restaurants - especially disappointing as it's $6 for a very small portion (2 small skewers). The \"Steamed Clam\" on the menu mentions sake, so I hoped for something like asari sakamushi. Don't make that mistake, as it's nothing close. Kabuki adds soy sauce and it just overpowers everything else.  My friend ordered two rolls; I forget Kabuki's names for them, but basically a dragon roll and a baked crab roll. The rolls were not made well and were sliced super thinly to boot, so nearly every piece disintegrated when we tried to pick them up. Also, the rolls took forever to arrive (around 20 mins after we finished appetizers, even though we ordered them at the same time). My sushi (saba, hamachi, sake) was actually passable, although maybe it's just because my expectations were lowered so much by all the lousy dishes that preceded it.  I admit I agonized a bit over giving a +1 because the sushi chef and busboy were very friendly (and the busboy is the only reason we ever got our drinks refilled, as our waitress just ignored us or forgot) - but I just can't do it. Again, it's not that anything was so terrible, but that nearly everything was bad or at best, mediocre. Even if you're in Town Square and need a sushi/Japanese fix, go somewhere else or manage your fix for another day.",

My 16 year old daughter decided she wanted to celebrate her 17 birthday along with 13 of her closest friends I made a reservation 7 days prior for Sep 17, I explained Kim who took the reservation there will be a total of 14 teenagers, they all be paying individually. Kim told me I would receive a phone call the morning of to reconfirm but never did, I decided to call and to reconfirm my self! My daughter and her friends complained of the poor service received. The restaurant offered no customer service to teenagers, the server sat them in separate tables of four when I was told they all will seat together. On top of all, they were told they couldn't pay individually but when each table received the bill, the restaurant had already included the gratuity....can you believe that...Kabuki and staff clearly took advantage of teenagers and spoiled a once in a life time birthday dinner that can't be replace.

It's essentially a spicy California roll topped with crab and salsa drizzled with yum-yum sauce. Sounds a little weird I know but it the most unique blend of cuisine-Japanese and southwest.   Now as for general service, it's usually crap. It takes forever for anything, mainly the check. There were many a times when I felt tempted to walk out because it was ridiculous to even get the server's attention. I did not do such a thing but if left unattended as such could cause problems, and we all know that hurts the restaurant.  Now, the reason I put four stars is because the other day a friend and I went and had the BEST service. I believe the server's name was Robert, but forgive me I am mistaken because he made our night! Super attentive, funny, and on his A game. Kabuki, this is who you want you wait staff model.

    "text": "Came here for their happy hour on a Monday to save me some money all the while enjoy some Japanese food.  AMBIANCE: The place wasn't crowded at all and the only spots with other hungry people where the booths and sushi bar. My boyfriend and I took a booth as well. Really like that it wasn't crowded as it usually is.  FOOD: I ordered their fried calamari & spicy tuna roll. The boyfriend ordered a Vegas roll and a gold rush? I forgot, correct me if I'm wrong on that last one.  Fried calamari-Cooked just right, squid wasn't chewy or tough, but I would've wanted more lemon as I do like adding lemon juice to anything fried.The yellow tangy sauce was more to my liking than the sweet brown sauce but still good. Spicy tuna roll-the sesame seeds balanced the taste for me but I couldn't really taste the tuna, I tasted a lot of the spiciness Gold rush?-Personally I'm not a fan of fried sushi, but I gave it a try! This roll was oddly sweet, it wasn't to my liking however. Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Vegas roll-Actually kinda had the same taste as the Gold rush?, but minus the sweet flavor  SERVICE: The guy who served us was like a ninja! He'd be there asking us what we wanted to drink, next thing you know he's disappeared and five minutes later he'd be back with our drinks! Then he reappeared and took our orders. Service was quick only took about 10mins for all our orders to get to our table. yay! But once it came to refills and the check, our ninja server was nowhere to be found.  To sum it up this is a great place to eat and enjoy yourself. I recommend to come here during their happy hour if you want to save some cash and get some sushi.",

She admits it really wasnt good before but trust me guys..  it's definitely the go to place for sushi off the strip.  I've had a fair share of sushi and everywhere I go it's good.. but this place was REALLY good. The place itself it very beautiful and ritzy looking.. you would expect the prices to be really expensive but they're not at all. It was the three of us and it cost 55 bucks for a miso soup, 3 rolls, scallop appetizer, a sashimi sampler, and some cokes. Not too shabby!  our appetizer, the Crispy Scallop Arare ($9) was soooo good! They were dice-sized pieces of scallop lightly battered and fried with rice crackers.. and the best part was the spicy mayo to dip in. and get this, the spicy mayo.. was actually spicy. thank you kabuki.   the sashimi plate ($9 wow) was also a big hit at my table. my faves were the shrimp, tuna, and yellowtail. fresh!!   the rolls we got were the Spider Roll ($10), the Shrimp Tempura Roll($8), and the Sunkissed roll ($10)... they were all good. not too much rice, not shady on the sashimi, no imitation crab. yayy.   If you're unsure of what to get.. get the items that has a red icon next to them. Those items are \"Chef Recommended\". Most of our items had this symbol!   Oh yeah, consider coming here during the day. It's in the Town Square Shopping Center where there are lots of stores to shop like H&M, ...-- I cant think of anything else because all i wanted was to go there. But there were others I swear..",

    "text": "I eat too much Japanese food don't I?  So Kabuki is a place that's a little bit on the fancy side of Japanese dining. I would even go as far as to say that it might be a little Americanized and more focused on how westerners like their Japanese cuisine.  It's not a bad thing, I just wouldn't consider it authentic Japanese by my own standards. That, however, is up to you to judge.. am i right?  The food is great! It may not be on par with some of the more authentic Japanese places that I've been to but it is definitely worth trying. I honestly have not tried anything on the menu that wasn't sushi so this review might be a little useless for those of you looking to find information on their entrees and such.  However, if you're curious about their sushi then I can tell you that it is indeed something worth coming to Kabuki for.  They are pretty creative and they've got some rolls that I haven't seen offered at other sushi places such as their 2 in 1 sushi roll, the Rose roll which pretty much takes a spicy tuna roll and a shrimp tempura roll and mushes it together to form one amazingly delicious roll that happens to be my favorite :) I've also seen something called the Baja Roll where they take pico de gallo and put shredded pieces of crab in it and take that and top off a spicy krab roll with it. Damn was it good.  If you're not rollin' in dough, then I suggest coming here during happy hour or reverse happy hour because most of the specialty rolls are about half off and they have a lot of good drinks for cheap too.  For tourists, Kabuki is located inside of a mall called Town Square which is at the end of the strip. I assume that most tourists stop by this mall sometime during their trip anyway so if you're ever at Town Square craving Japanese food, Kabuki is the spot.",

We had eaten at other Kabuki's and had quality food but this time it was much better. We waited for nothing, had our drinks refilled promptly and even had extra help when we had a spill!! I highly recommend this Kabuki's for a very pleasant, quiet, non-casino type experience.",

So you can understand my desperation and excitement when we came across Kabuki today.  I mean, in comparison to Japanese restaurants in California (Northern and Southern), Kabuki is mediocre.   But...For me, today, it was like a thirsty man stranded in the desert for extended periods of time tasting his first drink of water in weeks.    I ordered a veggie roll, slathered it with wasabi and had a foodgasm right there in front of all my co-workers.  I also ordered shoyu ramen, the noodles were overcooked and the broth was tasteless, but beggars can't be choosers....So this place gets 3 stars.  BTW, they have $1 Happy Endings...Sweet!

    "text": "So, hubby and I got stuck (literally) at Town Square last Halloween due to Town Scary (Halloween event on Sunday, October 31st).  You know, where kids walk past stores and trick-or-treat, etc.  There were ton of families milling about. Seriously, I've never seen so many people at Town Square before. We tried to leave at some point and realized that it would take us a good hour just to get out of the parking lot. At that point, we re-assessed plans to eat dinner at home and decided to eat at Town Square instead.  So we decided to check-out Kabuki because it was one of the restaurants at Town Square we hadn't tried.  Admittedly, I was a bit resistant to the idea of chain sushi restaurant at a big retail shopping center. So I didn't have the highest expectations. But -- big but -- I was pleasantly surprised! We sat at the sushi bar and had the following rolls:       --Vegas roll --Spider roll --Baja roll --Spicy tuna tempura roll  Two initial thoughts: the Vegas and Baja rolls were the bomb.  The Baja roll was not only different, but excellent.  It had jalapenos and pico de gallo on top. It was sooooo good! It was light, fresh, and flavorful. Same goes with the Vegas roll. I am a big fan of tempura sushi and cream cheese in rolls (which I know not everyone is a big fan of), so this was the best of both worlds.  I've subsequently visited during Happy Hour. The Happy Hour specials are off a smaller menu, but still nothing to sneeze at. I had some cucumber concoction and it was delicious.   Highly recommend!",

I was told I would have to pay full price that they could not subsitute it. $6   (tasted just as good as I remembered)  With that being said, I now had to change my lunch, so I tried the Sunkissed roll..  Good choice,  and they used brown rice and put the sauce on the side.   Along with an iced tea, it was a great meal...

Located in a prime location --Towne Square, this is the perfect place to end a day of shopping. While no shopping was involved on this particular day, my husband and I thought we would venture into Towne Square and see if we could get a table at Kabuki's. We only had to wait 15 minutes (on a Friday night) and while waiting, enjoyed a few drinks in the bar area.  To my delight, they had Hamachi Kama which is the cheek of the fish both tasty and grilled just right. We also  ordered a half dozen of the Hamahama oysters, gyoza, several pairs of ahi, salmon, ikura (salmon roe), ama ebi, and a quail egg shooter ( a a raw quail egg in ponzu sauce). Everything tasted very fresh. I normally don't order any rolls as I just enjoy nigiri or sashimi, however there was one roll that caught my eye: the Geisha roll. Unfortunately, I had no room to add to my tummy so that will have to wait for my next visit which will happen very soon. Service was great, food was wonderful and atmosphere was nice, not too bright and not too dark.  I am giving 4 stars as I have still not found a better sushi restaurant than Shiro's in Seattle. While the fish was fresh here at Kabuki's, it still did not have the melt-in-your-mouth experience as Shiro's. However, Kabuki's is at the top of my list here in Vegas for sushi. I will be back for happy hour and that Geisha roll!",

We are HUGE sushi fans but are both extremely picky regarding the quality of sushi we eat. Every all you can eat place or hole in the wall sushi places we've gone to have been nothing but bad news but this place has yet to disappoint. The food is always fresh and the servers always have fantastic customer service. Angie is one of the servers there and we usually request her because she is incredible. Our food is always out quickly, our drinks are always refilled when needed, and she never forgets to ask us about our meal. The manager there also does a great job with the restaurant and is very involved. You can tell she does a great job to make sure everyones experience is up to par. I recommend Kabuki to any sushi lover or to anyone trying to experience sushi for the first time. The problem is once you go, no other place will meet up to its standards.",

The service here is either really awesome or really bad, depending on who's section you get assigned to.  It's always good to order everything you think you'll want right away in case you get someone who doesn't check back with your table.  I like how the sushi is artfully placed on the plate- very cool.  If we're in town square, we're most likely eating here!",

We have been here a few time over the year and this was our last.  I was hoping it would get better since opening but i feel it is going south.  We sat at the sushi bar.  Drinks arrived with complimentary chilled edamame.  Not my favorite so we ordered Garlic edamame and baked mussels.  The edamame was oily and overly cooked. the baked mussels were bland at best.  We also had a spicy tuna roll and stopped there.  The tuna looked washed out, (super light pink in color).  It didn't really taste like anything??  Aside from the mediocre food is the sushi bar set up.  We sat near the center of the bar.  The sushi chefs put the menu items on the counter in front of them and the servers from the restaurant lean over the customers (ME) to pick up their order.  If I wanted to sit at the service bar I would have. I do not know why they can not have the waiters use the far end of the bar to pick up but i found it so annoying I almost stood up the last time to make a point. My wife and I felt in the way, so we promptly paid and left.  SO many better sushi places",

Yummmm the Spicy tuna was.....spicy tuna....the calamari was....fried calamari.....Oh yea and the grilled yellowtail collar was....grilled yellowtail collar. Ok so everything tasted like it should. Not completely out of this world or mind blowing. And yes I was the jerk that ordered the strawberry green tea with the mint. Combine two drinks in one.

I came back later that night with hubby and we gave it a shot.  All I can say is I'm glad that we didn't pay full price or I would have been pissed.  The \"happy hour\" sushi and rolls seemed old, like they were trying to get rid of them before they went bad, and EVERYTHING was loaded with green onions on the top.  I like onion, but not on top of my sushi.  Take my advice, if you want good sushi, find a hole in the wall joint, not this fancy looking spot just because of their stellar location.",

    "text": "Did not enjoy this place. I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.  Came here with a larger group of people. Food came relatively quickly and menu seemed extensive enough with some good, unique and tried-and-True Japanese/sushi restaurant options. Sushi was fresh-tasting, but nothing groundbreaking. I must say that I really enjoyed the oyster shooter and am craving it right now--this was the only dish were presentation lacked pretentiousness, yet taste was superb. Rolls and nigiri was also above average in taste and freshness...  So, since I seemed to like the food just fine, why only 2 stars? Well, for atmosphere, service and prices, to say exactly. Prices were over-inflated considering the food is not the best out there. I've had better at hole-in-a-wall sushi places! Service was rude and often made inappropriate comments over certain food orders (like my \"unique\" oyster shooter). Service was also slow and not helpful by any means. At the end of the day I was overcharged on my credit card bill and had to dispute the charges with my credit card, since managers/servers were not helpful.  Atmosphere was too trendy for my liking--I don't like to go to a sushi place and feel like I'm in a club, it is not my thing. I want to enjoy my food and eat in peace with relatively timely service. I didn't get peace here. Oh no. It's hard to get peace and quiet when techno music is booming all around and tables are so close together that you can hear everything that is being said by your neighboring diners despite the annoying and loud techno-trance! Decor is very loud as well, but not in a good sense. It's a hodge-podge of ridiculously looking booths and pictures that go better with a club environment than a sushi place.   This place scored a \"0\" for ethnicity, since there was nothing ethnic, Japanese about it. Even the food, although good, was largely Americanized. There was no Ikura (large caviar) even offered! Seaweed salad was not good and I had to ask waiter twice for a miso soup for him to even know if they served it/what it was.  I would not recommend this place. I do like Town Square experience, but I would go to countless other restaurants there before I went to Kabuki again.",

When the rest of the staff can hear the host over the din of the other shouting patrons and the blasting top 40 station, they shout in response.  We ordered the spider roll as an appetizer, but it came after our entrees.  The roll was good, nothing ground breaking.  The chicken teriyaki was tasty, but needed something besides just chicken (rice and salad on the side).  And they had good miso soup.  The rest was not so good.  The iced green tea tasted like water.  The tonkatsu was dry, and tasted like a mcnugget with barbeque sauce.  The salad was fresh from the bag?  The service was fine, but won't bring us back, especially in light of the food.",

They have a fairly generic drink menu, but I will say that it is very fairly priced for a Vegas restaurant.     Items ordered:  Tuna & Avocado cocktail - Good, served in a a half avocado, all though over salted.  Spicy Tuna Roll - Pretty good.  Gyoza - Very good, all though a little small.  Shrimp cocktail - served in a cool neon lit Champagne glass, the presentation was cool, but the actual shrimp had to be frozen.   Pretty bad quality.  We didn't finish it, and we are all fat guy big eaters.  Sashimi Plate - very good and well presented.  Beef & Chicken dinner - Good, but way overcooked  Spicy Udon Noodles with seafood - Excellent.  They made it a bit less spicy for me B/C I don't like food too hot.  Overall it wasn't that bad, but three stars for a couple paltry dishes and very uncoordinated, all though very friendly service.",

The ambience and prices suggested the food would be great, but in actuality, the fish was not fresh and prepared poorly. The appetizers weren't bad but nothing was worth the price. I have had much better and so can you (for much better prices)!",

When you first walk in the \"21 and over only\" section is to your right, where the bar is located. The hostess was very nice. I got the \"Baja Roll\" which is a generous serving.. it's a heaping mound of tomato salsa with shredded crab meat on top of a spicy crab roll ($6.95).  And I had the \"Ninja Deluxe\" which is strips of Teriyaki Chicken on a bed of lettuce, a bowl of white rice, a side of Tempura vegetables, a bowl of soup that I didnt like..lol, and 3 California roll pieces ($9.95).  I also had a bottle of \"Tea Zazz\" which is cold sparkling wasabi green tea with several different flavors.. I got the ginger mint flavor ($2.95).  The waitress was nice and attentive.. not anything exceptional but she was still very courteous.  I will definitely be coming back here.",

Its covered on a bed of mixed salad with shredded cucumbers and let me tell you, the tuna just melts in your mouth.  If you're still hungry also try the sea bass dish with brown rice, delicious.",

All that for $13.00, pretty cheap huh? and on top of that.. between 3pm-5pm its happy hour ! so rolls and appetizers are like cut half off and beers and drinks are like $2 and up. so me and my boyfriend ended up staying for like 3 hours there .   other than the food, SERVICE was great. never had an empty cup and always had the server on top of her game refilling our drinks. DEFINITELY would recommend this place .. with their deals and the service , got me coming back for lunch time again and again :D",

Walked in and was told we needed to wait 5 minutes. I'm thinking no problem, it's near the airport, and Vegas is tourist city. When we were finally seated (only 3 of us) the entire dining area had 3 tables full, the rest were empty.. why did I have to wait 5 minutes. Ordered a couple of the usual. Calamari, BSCR.. the Calamari here is better than one in cali. The BSCR here tho is not as good. When paying I gave our waitress our rewards card where I have a $15 birthday credit, And because their member system wasn't working was told I wouldn't be able to use it. The manager said I could get $5 off..uhm no, that ain't happening because it expires in 2 days. After about 5 minutes the manager finally said that she could remove few items from the bill. I don't appreciate all the drama that amounted because the system wasn't working.. it's not my fault. I probably won't come to this one, I'll have to try the summerlin location to see if I should venture all the way from Henderson or if I should find a new sushi place.",

Drinks were tasty, but very watered down/full of juice tasting.. for ~10 I want at least a shot of booze in my drink! Edamame was cold.. not a fan. Tempura was just ok, instead of sweet potatoes they had normal potatoes.. this is a sin in my book. We had the griled yellowtail collar.. I expected more of a seared thing, but this was fully cooked not yummy fish.. Other appetizer was the gyoza and they even managed to screw up frozen fried food. The dumpling was crispy on top and super soggy on the bottom.  The sushi was just EH... not fishy or anything, just not particularly good. The pacific roll was the best roll we tried by far... if you get dragged to this place like I did, play it safe and try that one !",

Once seated and looking over the menu we did not know what to order.  A lot of items were different than what we have ordered before. We decided to both order a dish they make instead of getting any sushi. All I can say is the dish me and my husband ordered we did not like.It was like a seafood mixture which was like fried or something. The combination and flavor was not what we enjoyed.(Photo below) Not sure what it was called.  If we go back I think we need to try the sushi instead of what you order off the menu because a lot of the photos I have seen the sushi looks much better than what we had. We may try it again sometime and I will update our experience then. I love Japanese restaurants so I was a bit upset that we left not liking what we ordered  (if your a local and have ate here and have had something you really enjoy message me I would love to know what to get! Thanks!)",

    "text": "This review is for the lunch my wife and I had here on a Friday afternoon. We were pleasantly surprised about how nice our experience was. We have always walked by and have never stopped in. I think it is a solid option for Japanese if you're in Town Square.  We came in just after 12 and were seated immediately. Both the restaurant and bar were busy but it wasn't loud, crazy, and hectic. Bernard was our server and he did a good job despite him running about 5 other tables beside us during the hour.   Their menu is extensive with lunch combos toward the back. You also get an order of edamame to snack on before your meal. I had the omakase deluxe combo (5 nigiri and 6 pieces of spicy tuna roll for $13.95) and a Vegas roll (deep fried salmon, crab, cream cheese, and avocado for $10.95). My wife had the Kabuki deluxe (chicken teriyaki, bbq beef ribs, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 3 pcs California roll for $13.95). This was plenty of food for both of us. I had no issues with the sushi and I especially liked the beef ribs, they had a nice barbecued flavor and were tender.  I would come back to try more of the Japanese fare and I would come back for happy hour after a movie or before I headed to one of the bars to get a little food and to warm up the engine.",

But during my trip to Vegas I was craving sushi and my handy dandy yelp showed me that there was a kabuki down the street from our hotel! Awesome location, close to shopping and h&m. Plenty of FREE parking behind h&m! Walked in for dinner and there was no wait! Got seated by the hostess and we ordered.  Firecracker was so good! Spicy tuna with wonton chips were so delicious we scarfed it down even before I could take a picture!  Albacore crunch roll was delicious! Wish I could have taken one for the long drive back to LA!  Stop by for the awesome happy hour and great service! I'll definitely be back! Nothing bad to say about this place :)  Oh and I just found out there free edamame is now organic! How great :) trI love free and healthy stuff!",

    "text": "I come here a lot during happy hour just cause my bill comes out fairly cheap. The food isn't something to rave about, but it's good for the price. The service is always impeccable and they are always friendly with a smile. Hence the 4 stars. But the food is more like 2.5-3 stars.   I ordered the spicy tuna, California roll, Philadelphia roll, dynamite roll, and salmon sushi. It's not too hard to make the basic rolls, so it's OK. The salmon sushi is a hit or miss. Sometimes it taste fresh, sometimes not, but it's 2.95. :)   I also ordered the chicken saboro bowl (seasoned ground chicken, egg, green onions, ginger, with rice). It's a big bowl for a decent price, so it's pretty good.   Overall, the food isn't to die for, but it isn't crappy either. I like this place and they have a rewards card, so make sure you sign up for one!! Points = free food!!",

The ingredients aren't terrible which makes it at least edible but I'd avoid the rolls if you can.   Surprisingly they are usually pretty busy so there might be a wait for a table but the bar should always have a few spots open. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and offers a very fun atmosphere for dinner with some friends.   I wouldn't be back for the food but for drinks ...possibly.   You won't leave feeling satisfied but if you're starving while shopping in Town Sq. I guess this will do.",

    "text": "It's the only restaurant I hadn't been to in Town Square because of the \"meh\" reviews and obviously Americanized menus. So, last night was my first visit and I'm impressed!  Our friends wanted to meet for Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm) and I figured, why not? While everyone else ordered several small bottles of House Sake (hot) -- Sho Chiku Bai Extra Dry ($3.95; H/H $1.95) and Sapporo (pitcher: $17.95; H/H $9.50 and tower: $23.95; H/H $12.50) for sake bombs, two of us shared the Kabuki Signature Sake Sangria -- fresh fruits, sake, shochu, grapefruit and cranberry juices ($24.95; H/H $18.95) which yielded 5-6 large glasses.   For food, Ruben and I had two orders of Salmon Nigiri - which apparently they just call \"sushi\" ($4.25; H/H $2.95), two orders of Rose Roll -- shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber, and avocado ($9.95; H/H $6.95), and a Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll -- spicy tuna, tempura crumb, avocado and smelt roe ($7.95; H/H $5.95). Everything was really tasty. The salmon was so good, fresh, as I love how thick it was cut. Of the two specialty rolls, I really enjoyed the Rose Roll. Great flavor, nice balance of texture, and a little kick of spice. Also, the rolls are huge so you're definitely getting the value!  Service was great and everyone was really nice. Our server was awesome about letting us know when it was last call for Happy Hour. Also, everything arrived promptly even with them being pretty busy.  The Happy Hour prices are nice. It was the perfect way to try an a la carte sushi restaurant without breaking the bank. The fish quality was a pleasant surprise that instantly garnered respect. Not sure if I would pay the regular prices on the specialty rolls though. The selection is limited on the Happy Hour menu and there were many other intriguing rolls -- that weren't deep-fried or filled with cream cheese (pass on both) -- that I may want to try in the future.  So, based on my wonderful experience, I'd love to revisit and take advantage of their Happy Hours (Reverse Happy Hour is Mon-Thurs 9pm-closing and Sun 8pm-closing with similar menus).",

The staff seemed friendly enough but they just seemed a little off to me, as if they weren't all accustomed to working with each other. The team chemistry was off.  In any case, my boyfriend and I got a few rolls and the sashimi salad. Now, if you know me, you would know that I NEVER ever order rolls. I only did that here because they were on happy hour and I was hungry. The rolls themselves are decent for the price, albeit messy and uneven, especially for a restaurant that is normally quite pricey. We got the spicy tuna roll, rose roll, and something else. All the rolls were decent and fresh but fairly unremarkable.  The sashimi salad actually had more fish than I was expecting! What a pleasant surprise. It was pretty standard fare but I always love the dressing so I gobbled that up.  My boyfriend ordered a sapporo and I got a sake sangria. The sangria had a lot of yummy fruit and got me feelin' good because I started drinking on an empty stomach. Yay happy hour!",

We started with a lychee martini. Can't even taste the goose. Next was yummy miso soup. Next up was their salad with delicious ginger dressing.   Albacore crunch roll: Omg this roll was my favorite. Sooo good. The dried garlic and ponzu sauce in this dish was amazing.   Spicy tuna crunch roll: This dish was delicious too! Great crunch, perfect rice, and flavorful tuna!  Amaebi and Ebi: so fresh. I love this menu item. Order it every time I eat sushi. And it doesn't fail here. Perfectly fried shrimp heads. Like eating potato chips.

Service is usually good.  We've only had one visit at Kabuki where service was below average.  Some of our orders were forgotten.  They accept reservations so if you're going with a party of 8 or more, I would suggest calling ahead.  They do get busy in the evening.  Price is a bit above average, but it is located in a shopping area.  My wife is a fan of the Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta.  I normally stick to the combo boxes...like the Premium Combination (Sashimi, Chicken Teriyaki and Mix Tempura) for $19.95.  I paid an extra $1 for having all Tuna Sashimi.",

    "text": "Kabuki  How many of you are tired of the same old restaurants you've constantly visited and are ready for a change? Well you are in the right place, I just so happen to be writing a review on the popular restaurant Kabuki.  For those of you that don't know what Kabuki is, it is a Japanese restaurant that serves exquisite sushi and other Japanese cuisines. There are multiple Kabuki restaurants located all over the United States and there are two located right here in Las Vegas! I have had Kabuki many times, as it is my favorite sushi restaurant and I just recently decided to visit again, but this time as a reviewer. Today I am going to review Kabuki's menu, their locations, and their atmosphere.   To some Kabuki's menu may seem a little over whelming as there is a variety of options to choose from, but I see their menu as appealing to everyone. Kabuki is known for their delicious sushi, but that is not all they have to offer. Kabuki is not just a sushi dining experience they also offer Japanese cuisine to help provide for everyone's wants and needs. Kabuki's menu of food is very easy to read and even shows some pictures of their food and their beautiful sushi rolls. Kabuki's menu also lists the prices for their food of course, and they are reasonable. The average prices range from anywhere of six dollars to thirty just depending on what you get. Not only does Kabuki provide an assorted menu of tasty looking food, but they also have great quality of food to show for it. Kabuki's sushi rolls are unique from other sushi places in Las Vegas and are well thought out; they have flavors and textures that compliment one and another. My favorite roll there is their spicy tuna crunch roll, it's slightly larger than average sushi rolls and is warmed up to wear it just melts in your mouth. Its contents contain spicy tuna, sushi grade rice, seaweed, cucumber, siracha mayo, and the outside of the roll has a certain breading to it giving it just the perfect amount of crunch.   Kabuki offers many locations in the United States including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Texas. There are currently two locations located in Nevada, one in Las Vegas and in Summerlin. Both of the Locations in Nevada are great spots for a restaurant! These two locations are easy to get to and are located in popular outdoor shopping malls making it a great spot to hangout out and grab something to eat after a long day of shopping. Unfortunately I have not yet been to the Summerlin location inside of Tavoli Village shopping center, but I have been to Tavoli Village and I do know it's a beautiful clean mall. I have however been to the Las Vegas Kabuki restaurant location located at Town Square. Town Square is easy accessible by being right off of the 215 freeway and is a fun hip outdoor shopping mall. You might think Kabuki would be hard to reach since it is inside of a mall, but it is not. Kabuki is on a corner of the mall making it easily accessible to people already shopping around the mall and it is also easily accessible to people just stopping by to chow down on some delicious Japanese cuisine.   The last thing I would like to share about Kabuki is their atmosphere. Kabuki's atmosphere can be simply summed up as laid back, but sophisticated. The inside of the Japanese restaurant is very clean and pleasant to eat in. I always feel very relaxed whenever I visit Kabuki and I can thank their perfectly dimmed lighting for that, making it just light enough to see where you're going and what you are eating. I also love Kabuki's restaurant color scheme, it is black and red making it very sleek and appealing. Kabuki's seating is also pleasing to the eye and is very comfortable making your meal even more enjoyable. A bonus, their bathrooms are always clean! Kabuki's atmosphere really goes above and beyond due to their amazing staff, as they generally do set the mood. From the second you walk into Kabuki you are greeted with kindness from the hostess waiting to seat you and the servers really make it an easy pleasurable time. I am always treated with respect from the servers in Kabuki and they are very amiable, they genially seem like they care. The servers never make you wait an outstanding time and periodically check up on you to see how you're doing and how the meal is. Another thing I really love about their servers is that they are never hard to flag down and whenever I need something it seems there always right there to assist me. Both the servers and the atmosphere make Kabuki a fun happy place to be at and they always have me coming back for more!  Overall, Kabuki Japanese Restaurant gets a ten out of ten from me. After reading this review I hope I encouraged you to get out there and try Kabuki or if you have already tried it, I hope this review made you want to go back. I strongly believe this restaurant has all of the qualities to make it a great restaurant including its variety of foods on its menu along with its quality of food.",

    "text": "I dropped by to celebrate a quick birthday lunch with a coworker. I had never been here and decided to try a couple sushi rolls: the sunkissed salmon and the asparagus & salmon garlic crunch. They were both ok, although I wish I had known the former had mayo. The menu doesn't describe any use of mayo and when it arrived, the plate was covered in the stuff. (Can't stand mayo and I would have asked for no mayo!) I don't like to waste food, however, if I can help it, so thankfully it was mostly at the bottom, although I think some mayo was also mixed in with the spicy tuna. In fact, the spicy tuna is made quite differently than other places. It didn't really taste like tuna at all, actually. All in all, I would say a solid 3 - I would probably return if other friends were hosting an event here, but it's neither the best nor the worst sushi I've had. Service was great, ambiance pretty nice.",

Only comment about that it the dish wash room is to the left of the sushi bar with the curtain barely covering the mess going on- basically it's just tons of water all over the floor and seems very unsanitary if servers are walking by there... seemed like the kitchen was through same door but to the other side but yeah you just get a full view of the wash room while your eating which is strange.  Sushi menu was very limited in my opinion, specially for anyone who loves sushi but not shell fish you're going to be hard pressed to find a roll without crab (ca roll inside) but we made it work and what we did order was really really good. The Brussels sprouts are a must too. Brussels sprouts seem to be gracing lots of appetizer menus and we always like to try them, these ones where my favorite.  Our server was wonderful! Overall we had a nice date here and enjoyed our food.",

My friend and I were doing some shopping this past weekend and it was getting late and of course shopping kicks up an appetite.   When can you ever go wrong with sushi? Never! I went on yelp to see if I needed a reservation and come to find out it just so happened to be Happy Hour! Score!!! When we walked in it wasn't busy at all. The hostess greeted us right away and when I asked if we needed to sit at the bar for happy hour he said no. I thought this was cool because most places do only honor the happy hour in the bar area. This past Sunday night had great weather so why not check out their patio.  Once we were seated, our waiter came over shortly after. He was pretty awesome and really helpful the entire time. We asked him a few questions about the menu and even some things that we didn't see on the menu that they normally offered in LA which was the crab miso soup! Come to find out he was also from California and knew exactly what we were talking about but also had to relay the bad news that they unfortunately didn't offer that on the menu in Vegas! Bummer but it was okay we found plenty of more great things on the Happy Hour menu. All in all this was a great visit with excellent customer service! Can't wait to make this one of my regular Happy Hour spots in town!",

Each dish we got was approx $10-15, and better yet, each dish was really good... esp the okanomiyaki one.

I feel like they don't really want me here, which is amazing considering that it's 7:30pm on a Friday and the restaurant is nearly empty. Usually the hosts shuttle us straight into the bar, even if there are plenty of seats in the dining room. I've intentionally just started walking straight into the bar, but the bar was full tonight. Dining room empty. I waited 10 minutes for water. It's weird. Maybe the hosts need to be shaken up a bit? But the food is great so I'll keep coming back.",

We all decided to have a bunch of different rolls and share with the group.  Kabuki was good, but there were some things I didn't like.    Is place was huge.  From the outside it didn't look that big but the decor and space was very cool.   Service was good as our waitress took care of our needs.    We tried a number of rolls that included the Kabuki Roll, Rainbow Roll, Dragon Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Asperagus & Salmon Garlic roll.   All were good, but my complaint is that the California portion of the roll was the salad mixture rather than pieces of crab and cucumber.  I a man not a big fan of that and hence my rating.  If you enjoy that, then your rating might be really different.  I really liked the dragon roll as I enjoy eel and the presentation alone was really cool.    Overall the experience was good, just don't like the way they do the California part of the rolls.",

The waiter came out as soon as we sat down took our drink order and made a couple good drink suggestions I went for the SAKIRITA (wine and fruit lots of it ) delish !!!! Ordered LOBSTER ROLL, SPIDER ROLL , LAVA ROLL (spicy tuna and fried jalapeno)  .  Very good and fast service !!!!",

    "text": "So happy I finally got to give this place a try. Came here around 3:30 which is their happy hour and almost the end of their lunch specials. Lunch specials is open to 4pm and their happy hour is 3-6pm. There are so many different varieties on their menu to choose from. They have a nice happy hour too. I ordered the spicy tuna, dynamite roll, and a salmon Yama which wasn't on menu but they have it if you ask for it. What I really like is their fresh wasabi but you have to ask for it. They will give it to you. I really like the interior inside of the restaurant and enjoyed sitting at the booth. I also like their soy sauce bottle because it doesn't drip when you pour soy sauce. The spicy tuna roll came out first and it was delicious. Everything we ordered came out great. I loved everything we ordered and ate. Our server was attentive as well. This will definitely be my new go to spot.",

Love the ambiance, the staff is very professional, the servers have always been attentive to all my needs and never a empty glass on the table.  The food comes to your table warm, the presentation is awesome and each food item looks so delicious and like a picture in the food magazines.  When it comes to taste, OMG YUM!  I love it so much, makes my mouth water when I see the food and the portion size is awesome!  When it comes to pricing, very competitive and reasonable!   A must go for all Friends, Family, Co-Workers or a Nice Hot Date!  God Speed!  Jake Out For Now!",

The rolls were very tasty but some were very loose. I guess the chef was in a hurry to go home? We were the last table in the place when they started with the whole..lets put chairs on tables. They even did that next to us which I thought was a bit much. So we rushed through our food and got outta there since they did not want us to linger. It was weird since I have been here before at that time and they never acted this way. I normally love this place.",

    "text": "Was going to be at Town Square last night to see the new LCD Soundsystem documentary (one word review inside a review:  AMAZING), and I'm not a huge fan of the Town Square dining options.   Kabuki has disappointed me in the past with what seemed to be generic plates of food synonymous with chain restaurants.   This was the perfect time for me to possibly experience a 2 star meal so that I could further expand my rating distributions which lean towards 3-5 star reviews.  PERFECT.  We started by trying the Sake Sangria as we'd been recommended it by a friend who knows how much we like the Bachi Burger Sake Sangria.   It got brought out in a giant carafe with a lot of fruit mixed throughout.  So far so good.   Tastewise?  Not even close, Bachi Burger's version blows it out of the water.   It had a strong flavor within it that didn't sit well with it.  At first I thought it was possibly overpowered with sake but my dining companion suggested that they thought it was the lemon peel.   I'm going to lean towards that being the origin of the flavor because after polishing off this gigantic monstrosity of a carafe, neither of us had a buzz.   What a deal for $24!  Strike one, but on the plus side, the 2 star review was already writing itself!  Things took a turn when the food started arriving, surprisingly enough to me.   First up was the garlic and sea salt edamame.   A bit overpriced at $5 I thought but the amount they provided as well as the deliciousness of it made it worth it.  The edamame was perfectly cooked and the sea salt and garlic mixed throughout was extremely tasty.  They also brought out an extra bowl of regular edamame, which they said was on the house.   Appreciated, but a little weird to me considering we'd ordered this giant plate of the other edamame.   None of the regular ones got eaten unfortunately.    Next up was the Niku Kushiyaki appetizer, a skewer of beef with shishito peppers.  I thought the meat was a tad overcooked but the flavors were nice, particularly when combined with the shishito and whatever sauce was on the plate with them.   A good choice for $6.  Yellowtail Carpaccio is a standard order for me at a sushi restaurant and this one didn't impress, but wasn't necessarily bad either.  My companion ordered the king crab miso soup which I tried a bit of and greatly enjoyed.  The crab was plentiful throughout and I thought it had a nice flavor that melded nicely with the standard miso.  Lastly I had the Sushi Omakase Special which had an assortment of nigiri with a California Roll and a bowl of regular miso soup.   I was quite impressed with the majority of the nigiri.   Most of the fish tasted fresh and were prepared well, and the california roll was... well, a california roll, but a good version nonetheless.  The only two downsides to the plate were the Krab nigiri, which tasted like the cheap imitation it is, and the eel, which is usually my favorite bite on a plate of Omakase, but this one didn't taste as tender as I'm used to, which I think was a sign it might not be as fresh.   All the other bites were great though and I cleaned my plate.  So I'm a little indifferent on how I feel.  On the one hand, now I still only have a handful of 1 and 2 star reviews, but on the other hand, I had a really nice meal!   It'd be a 4 star review if the Sake Sangria wasn't so disappointing and also if I hadnt had the mediocre meals I've had here in the past.",

The tempura was very tasty, and the peppers were enjoyable, and pretty mild...until I ate a super sneaky extra spicy one.  My mouth was on fire for about 15 minutes.  I won't be ordering those again.  We also got two rolls- the Las Vegas, and the lobster roll.  I'm not usually a fan of the Las Vegas roll, but theirs was pretty good.  I was looking forward to the lobster roll, but it didn't have much flavor, and it was really messy.  I had to pick it up off the plate with both hands, and it was still falling apart.   The cocktails we had were just okay too.  Lychee sake mojito was just sweet, and meh.  The sangria was enjoyable.  It was kind of grapefruity, and slightly bitter, but it had a unique taste to it. I'd like to come again for happy hour, and try a few more things.  For now, I'm kind of on the fence about this place.",

The sea bass was cooked to perfection, full of flavor & the tomato salsa mix truly makes this dish intoxicating!  Now here's where I go off the beaten path, which makes me hesitant to award 4stars. The Lotus on Fire roll was inconsistent...  Returned a week later for a light meal, which consisted of the Lotus on Fire roll. It lack the rich flavor it had the first time it touched my palate. The rice was more prominent this round, the sauce was disappointingly bland, the only thing I could taste & in succession was rice, then the heat of the jalapeno pepper.

I ordered the soy ramen, the broth was amazing, but they noodles & hard boiled egg were both over cooked. Another person in our group got teriyaki chicken and remarked that we can get better for much less money in the middle of no where new mexico.  The atmosphere and the service were both nice, no complaints in either of those departments but nothing spectacular either.  If your thinking of coming here I'd suggest looking for a little mom & pop shop instead, the food will probably be better and so will the prices.",

    "text": "Tasty food, refreshing drinks, stellar service (shoutout to Jenny!), and sleek atmosphere! Kabuki will definitely be my go-to sit down spot in Town Square.   The menu spans sushi, noodles, traditional Japanese as well as fusion-y appetizers, larger plates, and hot stone BBQ. My boyfriend and I ordered a sampling of most of those items. He's half-Japanese and a raw fish aficionado to boot and I'm, well, not exactly one haha, but we both enjoyed the dragon roll (has unagi drizzled in a yummy sauce and soft-shell crab). *BONUS POINTS FOR BROWN RICE SUBSTITUTION ON THE SUSHI ROLL.* Chicken karaage + another flavorful/mildly spicy sauce and BBQ pork belly hit the carnivorous spot, and the portion size was perfect for sharing between two. The Tokyo quesadilla (mozzarella in a wonton shell topped with pico de gallo) was the fusion-y surprise, and it was a nice palate cleanser between the meat and fish. My sizable goblet of sake sangria was awfully refreshing.  Our waitress, Jenny, was so warm and friendly while offering efficient and attentive service. When we inquired she even asked the kitchen where my boyfriend can procure unagi on his own here in Vegas (we moved from L.A. and he misses the extensive Japanese grocery options of Southern California).  Decor is sleek and music was not overly loud. It was a perfect break from the sound level of our other Friday night activities. They have ample seating space for everything from pairs to larger groups.  Kabuki earns a two-thumbs up!",

I don't think their regular menu is that impressive nor would I pay the price. Their happy hour used to be larger and have even more items and better rolls but it's still a good bang for your buck! We still have Kabuki in our rotation of HH's the only difference now it that we also get to take advantage of their sake specials HEHE   Some of my must haves: --Spicy Tuna Salad: comes on a bed of shredded cucumbers, daikon and gobo.. mmm light and refreshing. --Fire Cracker: Spicy tuna with cilantro & onions served with fried wonton crackers! --Calamari: It's deep fried! Of course it's good! --Philly roll with no cream cheese: The cut of salmon is big.. yummm  --Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream: Not on HH but worth the $   --Love the complimentary edamame  The service has always been really nice and fast. If you're looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant.. don't come here. It's Korean owned and very \"Americanized...\"  HOT TIP: Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program.. It's free and you get a gift certificate on your birthday ;]]]",

The food arrives fairly quickly, and the presentations are always beautiful. Hot green tea (my personal favorite) is on the house (along with complimentary edamame).

The presentation of the chicken wings was very nice although I feel like it might've been too much and they should really add more wings instead of wasting their money and time adding the little leaf thing (see picture). Their sweet potatoes fries were really good. It's only nice to come here if you're not too hungry but just want something light to snack on. If you're hungry, your bill will probably add up pretty quick. We tried their dynamite roll and it was just too rich that we ended up not finishing it. Server also accidentally put water in my mango lemonade when he was refilling it. If you're hungry but not too hungry, try this place. Otherwise, I would try an AYCE place instead like Goyemon.",

They do have a pretty good Happy Hour Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and Reverse Happy Hour Sundays 8PM to Closing, Monday-Thursday 9PM to Closing for a large menu of various food and drinks.  You have options for dining here. You can put in a reservation for a table which depending on the time and day could be at least an hour wait.  You can take a seat at they sushi bar which I believe is first come first serve. Or when you come in occupy the bar area on the right which is also first come first serve, it is more relaxing and great for lounging with large groups we come with at least 10-15 people and we stayed there for hours.  Service was pretty good for most of the night. Except for when they didn't bring me my food to me and later finding out they placed them on the table with the other half of the group where it got devoured.  They also were bad keeping track of who ordered what and billing the right person.    Kabuki is nicely decorated and food looked good. Loved the towers of beer as we ordered a bunch of them.  I did have a good time mostly because of the people I was with.  But I did  leave hungry please bring me my food I ordered nice time then I'll raise up the rating otherwise Kabuki is a between 3 and 4 star rating for me, more like 3.4.",

They have a pretty big menu with hot and cold appetizers, noodles, soups, salads, entrees (meat and fish) , sushi/sashimi, and even a good selection of vegetarian dishes.  Prices are very good during lunch and a little bit on the higher end at dinner but the portions are good.  My favorite is the unagi bowl (eel and rice). I also really like the sushi combo which comes with a side of soup or salad (you get 6 pc nigiri plus a California or spicy tuna roll for the lunch portion  and double the nigiri at dinner). The sushi rice is a little harder than I like (not sure if it's undercooked?) but overall, it's a good/quick meal.  The service is always very good. The servers are friendly and the food doesn't take very long to come out.  Overall Kabuki is a great option especially since many of the restaurants at Town Square serve American food.",

The drinks were STRONG and cheap, just the way I like it! Lol. The ramen was super delicious, but made even better by the addition of egg & pork belly. The spicy garlic edamame was the winner of the table, and we could barely contain ourselves eating it.

With lunch combinations starting at $11.95 which include soup, salad, rice and whatever combination you choose, it's sure to fill you up.   Today i met two of my colleagues here and I had the shrimp tempura roll 4/5, quite tasty and cut into 6 pieces so large they are almost more than a mouthful. The salmon nigiri was fresh and on point. No skimping on the size of the fish here. My colleagues ordered the lunch combination chicken and beef 4/5 and the salmon. Needless to say, all of our plates were spotless!   Overall a good lunch, quick attentive service and of course would come back soon!",

Originally, I wanted to just go watch Portland vs. GSW but that failed due to the massive pillars that are up at the bar.  If you're not sitting in the middle, the only view you get is a little slit of the TV.  I couldn't see the score or anything lol.  I was feeling a little adventurous and decided to take on the cocktail drink menu.  I successfully tried 6/12 of the drinks and I enjoyed them all.  Some were stronger than others, but the quality and presentation were very much there.  Also, I didn't wake up with a banging headache the next day which is a plus!  The bartender did okay with coming around in a timely manner, but I found it odd that he only asked about food when we first arrived.  Most bars will check on you after you've been there awhile to see if you've changed your mind.  I love their food and eventually ended up hungry after all of those drinks, but we ended up going elsewhere since the bartender was only around every 30 minutes.  To be fair, it was a Saturday night around 8 and they were busy.  No hard feelings.  I'll be back to try the remaining 6 lol cheers!",

Signage about HH looked like a good deal, offered early and late, weekdays only.

Today, we just went in for dinner since we were around the area. My mom and I got the spicy tuna salad.  Tuna had a small kick of spice and the greens were fresh. Dressing was light and perfect.   We also ordered an asparagus salmon roll which was good.  Obviously by choice we are trying to eat a little light and healthy. It was good but nothing special honestly.   The kids meal had a good amount. I ate most of the tempura it came with but we got the beef for my daughter. She really enjoyed it.  The hostess gave her an origami shark which is fun for kids.   Our server was nice, he did his check backs promptly, and refilled our water as needed.   Cool thing was he checked us out at the table with his device thing which I thought was unique.   Restaurant itself was nice. The have a sushi bar, a bar for non dine ins but to grab quick bites and drinks, and then the regular dining area. Dimly lit to set the mood.",

DON'T BE LIKE ME!  Stopped in before watching a movie at the AMC and was surprised that they were in fact SUPER open. One of the servers kindly directed me towards the front where the host was as I am sure I looked like a lost puppy.   My thoughts? Out of 5 stars each? Garlic Edamame - 5 Lava Roll (salmon, cream cheese, spicy tuna, krab, avocado, deep-fried jalapenos, spicy mayo, eel sauce) - 5 Kabuki Roll (spicy crunch roll topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy albacore, spicy tuna, smelt egg, salmon egg, snow crab) Lychee Lime Saketini - 4   Everything was delicious! I particularly enjoyed the Lava Roll which surprised me because I am usually a weaksauce for hot stuff. I will definitely be ordering that and the edamame again. Saketini and hot sake to wash my food down. EXCELLENT service on top of all that.   Will definitely be returning to check out their Happy Hour! Monday to Friday 3-6pm or 9pm-close Monday-Saturday for late nite HH, yall (8p-close on Sundays).   GO. Then Yelp about it so I can read it and see what else to order.",

We were served by Denise and she was friendly and attentive.  She gave us two iced waters with lemon slices, a nice touch.  Then we ordered the combo lunches which are very reasonable from $10.95 to $12.95.  They come with a big bowl of hot miso soup and a tasty salad.  Dude ordered the beef and chicken teriyaki and I had the shrimp tempura and beef teriyaki. You get a choice of brown or white rice and the bowls of brown rice were soup size bowls!

I even got my fiance hooked on this place.   Located inside the Town Square, the south east side of Las Vegas, I decided to take my fiance to my old stomping grounds. Low and behold, the place is still in the same spot, but the people and customer service is still on point. They have a massive menu that has changed over time, but they get better every single time. From salads to small plates, noodles, soups, bento box style lunches, sushi/sashimi and specialty rolls, and now even poke bowls. They have something from everyone.   Since I have been here more than you can count on two hands, I will talk about a few dishes to note. We normally come here around lunch or right before the rush hour for dinner. At lunch time they have bento style lunches (the ninja deluxe, the kabuki deluxe, and the samurai deluxe which are all awesome. They all come with some form of protein (chicken or beef teriyaki or bbq beef) as well as rice, salad, miso soup, and California rolls. If you are not craving such a huge meal, definitely would recommend getting one their soups or noodles. My favorite is the Seafood Nabeyaki Udon. This dish has Japanese udon noodles, clam, calamari, poached egg and shrimp tempura. Best combination, especially if you want a balanced meal. This alone normally fills me up with my favorite roll, the Baja Roll. Contains tomato salsa, krab, and spicy krab roll. This is all for the crab lovers and those who love spicy. You will actually want to keep eating it as their sushi tends to taste more fresh and done nicely. I can go on and on about each platter.  You ask, why we keep coming back? Well, one they have two happy hours, 3pm-6pm sushi is about half off and Monday through Friday. Then Monday through Thursday from 9pm to close. Not many places that serve Japanese food do it twice in one day. They also have it on Sunday and that's 8pm to close. Their prices are the best for the quality and you get a lot. Every single time we have gone here, servers are always on point. Plus, this is a place that's worth going to compared to places that are over hyped on the strip and are considered under par.",

    "text": "Let's face it- Kabuki is a chain sushi restaurant and there are so many unique sushi restaurants (especially AYCE) in Las Vegas. Why would you choose this one?  Well, we love that it's in Town Square so makes for a perfect date night- dinner + movie. AND it really IS pretty damn delicious! They have an awesome Happy Hour from 3-6pm in the lounge but if you order rolls of their regular menu the prices aren't half bad. The simple rolls: California, Philadelphia, etc. range from $4-6.  They have a wide variety of hot food items as well so if there's someone in your party that doesn't like sushi, there's still a seat at the table for them. Do yourself a favor and order the sauteed asparagus- it's SO yum!   The service is always super friendly and prompt too. They have loads of seating and the lighting is intimate.",

I can't really say the price the food is what makes me a fan but the location and the atmosphere does.  I can maybe see myself meeting up with friends to grab some food here once a month.  But one of my friend's husband says the protion is huge during lunch so I will have to check it out during lunch! I had the Spicy Seafood Udon Noodle was what I ordered and it was also a large portion...I would definitely go back and check o lunch!",

Right away we were greeted with a smile and was seated right away.  (It helped it was not lunch rush yet). We started with spider roll which was yummy and big.  I always end up getting a bento box and a sashimi sampler.  The presentation was superb and beautiful for the sampler.  ---however the fish looked kinda dry....tasted fresh but looked dry.  Who could go wrong with the bento box.  I just wish the salad had the miso peanut dressing rather than that gingery salad dressing.  Our waiter- \"Won\" was very attentive and always had a smile on his face.    This makes a nice place for a date or out of towners for that ambiance setting.

I felt like I needed some A1 or bbq sauce...but you can never go wrong with miso soup- but it will never fill you up. So I woudn't recommend this place to people who don't like to eat raw flesh of fish that smell like the women's restroom. I'll give them this- tempura green tea ice cream- Amazing! I can live off of it. I would just have to get it to-go in order to escape that bathrom smell (sushi). yuck. lol",

    "text": "I would normally give this restaurant four to five stars but after my experience on Monday for lunch I have to drop my rating to two stars. I dine here every time I'm in Vegas and have always been more than satisfied. This time around was just the opposite. I went during lunch with my parents and my sister and ordered off the lunch menu. The server must have been new because the service was substandard. My sister and I ordered the tonkatsu and said lunch portion. The server asked, \"with tempura\" I said no just tonkatsu. He asked the same thing to my sister. I understand upselling, but if I want tempura I would ask for it. My parents ordered the salmon and tempura lunch combo and said they would be sharing it. The real issue occured when the bill arrived and we were all charged dinner prices. Mind you this was one in the afternoon. When I brought this to the servers attention he said \"oh, you wanted lunch?\" He said he didn't know that and would take care of it. He returned with the bill but to my surprise only one of the meals had been adjusted to the lunch price. I again said we all ordered lunch he said he didn't know that and would have to talk to the manager. Why I ask would one person order lunch and the other two dinner when we are there during lunch.  When the bill finally returned they still had the dinner charges on the bill and just took out one tonkatsu. The server said don't worry it comes out to the same as three lunches. I asked why couldn't they just charge us for the lunches so I could see it itemized and not just assume it was correct. At this point I was fustrated and went up to speak with the manager, (and I use this term \"manager\" loosely)Tom Suciawan. It finally dawned on me why this simple customer service issue turned into a hot mess. Tom wouldn't know customer service if it bit him in the a--. When I went up to him he proceeded to give me attitude and said rudely\"it's all been taken care of and you got dinner portions for the price of lunch\". He said he already spoke to the server and would speak to him again. I replied that I simply wanted to bring this to attention, but was frankly surprised with his lack of customer service himself. I can see where his staff could lack in this area as Tom would be the last person who should be training them. With so many places to eat in Vegas, what brings me back is great service. My warning to lunch diners, be sure you emphasize you are odering lunch not dinner and be sure you check your bill!",

Everything containing \"spicy tuna\" (yes, quoted, I have no idea if it was tuna at all, though I have a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't) was watered down with diced tomatoes! Awful! Less \"tuna\" and more tomatoes? Yuck! My roll was poorly executed and quickly fell apart when dipped into the soy boat. Even my iced green tea seamed too diluted to be called tea. The mushroom miso was okay, so I gave it 1 star. DO NOT visit this place. If you're stuck at Town Square, you're better off saving your money and having a sandwich at Capriatti's!",

He really paid attention to all the little things, made recommendations, worried even about the fish roe having wasabi in it for the kids, brought refills promptly, and asked the chef to make sure my crab legs were not to buttery or oily.  He is probably the best server I have had in Las Vegas which is saying a lot in a town that specializes in hospitality!!!",

Their sushi, as other Yelpers point out, is average, though they do get creative with their rolls (the Lotus on Fire and Baha rolls are a nice change of pace).  I usually stick with the sashimi salad - a medley of salmon, tuna, white fish and whatever other raw goodies they have on hand that day - all in a bed of greens.  The other nice part about Kabuki: their frequent diner card. Every time you get 500 points, you get a gift certificate for $25.  Bottom line: Kabuki is a good go-to lunch spot, especially if you sit in Sunny's section!",

The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated right away.  I ordered a salmon teriyaki lunch combo and hubby got the miso ramen.  Bleh.  Bland.  From the salmon to the tempura, nothing stood out.  It was kind of...tasteless.  Hubby's ramen was super salty.  What we had did not inspire me to try their sushi or really anything else.    And service?  Lackluster.  Despite the emptiness of the restaurant, she wasn't around much and you had to really flag her down if you wanted something.    Not worth it.",

    "text": "Went to Kabuki last night on a date. My first time trying sushi.  Now let me state... I consider myself to be fairly open-minded about food, and willing to try new dishes. I'd always avoided sushi because 1) I was worried that I would be repulsed by the texture and 2) sushi is such a broad dish that it can be very intimidating to order. I learned new lessons last night.  I ordered the cha-siu Ramen. It was cold and windy outside, so noodles and broth sounded perfect. My date ordered the spicy tuna roll, a screaming orgasm with fresh wasabi, and the geisha roll.   I have nothing to compare it to, obviously, but everything was delicious, particularly the screaming orgasm. It is an appropriately named dish. Everything tasted very fresh, and the flavors all complemented each other harmoniously. The ramen was really good as well... the pork was a touch overcooked, at least for me, but the broth was warm and spicy, with perfectly cooked noodles.  The service was spot on and the ambiance was inviting and comfortable. I look forward to trying new dishes next time.",

First, the bartender took at least 8-10 minutes to acknowledge me.  (He was busy chatting it up with two ladies seating at the bar.) Second, I asked him,... I do not like any mayo and anything with cream, but I would like a sushi roll that has spicy tuna.  He could not recommend any sushi roll with my requirements.  Anyway, I ended up getting a chicken teriyaki bento box.  Nothing special.  3 stars",

This time I ate at the one at town square. First of all they don't have all you can eat sushi here which is absolutely ridiculous because if you get just two rolls it's the same price as all you can eat almost anywhere else. Second of all the sushi here sucks ass!!!! I got one roll (Alaskan Roll) and it was terrible ( Thought about throwing it at someone) Sushi is one of my favorite kinds of food and this place ruined it for me, even though I'll probably get some sushi pretty soon. The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because the atmosphere is nice and I met one of the most amazing and beautiful girls here so It was definitely a great  experience  but they need to step there game up and at least have all you can eat sushi to make up for the quality of the food. Love this place!!! Lmao",

Well, for one, if a roll is too big to fit in my mouth, that's not a plus. It makes it messy to eat and it doesn't let me get a good blend of the flavors. It's bad etiquette and poor presentation. I don't fault the staff for that, as they're preparing to specifications and to the expectations of people who frequent from the strip - go big or go home.  The rolls weren't very flavorful and used the same two sauces repeatedly. Can I get some eel or ponzu sauce? The gyoza were oddly dry. I'll take the 'chase down your waitress' service in Chinatown to get good, authentic sushi. Leave the huge piles of rice that can't fit my mouth for the tourists. And my friend who was with me said that her iced tea tasted like Mio... no good. I'd give it a pass. Not terrible for a quick bite, but if you want something authentic, take off your tophat and monocle and walk into an off-strip dive.",

It got a little bit more busy later but still surprisingly slow for a Friday, I thought.  Their saketinis are sooo yummy. First, I got the creamy peach and that was very tasty.. sweet but not too strong. My second drink was the Fuji Apple saketini and that was.. kind of strong and it didn't taste like Fuji apples.. my friend said they put apple puckers in there.. that was all I could taste pretty much. I tried my friend's mango chu-hi (a sochu drink) and it was good.. kind of weak, but she said there is mango puree in there. yum!  For appetizers: -Spicy Tuna Salad ($4.95 HH) Spicy tuna on top of spring lettuce, shredded cucumber and radish sprouts. Good stuff, but I just don't like the ground up spicy tuna.. I like them in chunks! -Sesame Chicken ($4.95 HH)  -Salmon nigiri ($2.50 HH)  -Vegad Roll ($5.95 HH) -Agedashi Tofu ($3.95 HH)   They still have reverse happy hour, I think starting at 9pm. It used to buy select items and regular price and get the second item (in the same category) for a $1 but I think they did away with this.   Overall, their food and happy hour is good. I'd say regular price, they are kind of high. But that could be due to being located in a popular shopping center.. but who knows. Will be back :)",

I ordered Taro and it did NOT taste fresh and it tasted as if it were defrosted by a microwave. YUCK. I was disappointed in the rolls I purchased; they were rolled too loosely and fell apart! :( Too expensive for the quality you get. Happy hour is cool. The cocktails aren't anything special....(tastes as if they're made with the cheapest sake/soju, bottom shelf liquor...)  Oh yeah, and their soups...well the broth tastes as if it's been premade by some mix rather than by fresh meats. It's nothing better than top-ramen.   Lastly, I must say, their wait staff mainly consists of the typical non-japanese asians for an Americanize Japanese restaurant....I believe there is 1 or 2 people that were of Japanese decent. The manager(s) is/are Korean. So, this place falls short of authenticity. At least they tried!",

We tried staying off the strip to avoid the high cost associated with it, and ran into this in the shopping center well over a mile down the road.  We did the communal munch, ordering several dishes and picking at them with our chopsticks. Here's a breakdown of our eats:  * Sunkist Roll: Good flavor to start, but the onion garnish placed on top of the sushi overpowered the taste of the salmon.  * Spicy Tuna over Sticky Rice: Fairly decent. Spicy tuna was comparable to most places and the sticky rice it sat on was decent.  * Oyster Shot in Ponzu Sauce: Are you serious? When did you order this, babe? It was good, but the sauce was definitely a bit salty. Great tasting oyster though!  * Korean Barbecue Short Ribs/Teriyaki Chicken with rice: The Korean BBQ was tender and juicy. I wish I could say the same for the chicken; that was a bit overcooked, making the chicken strips a little on the dry side.  The house salad was overpowered with the flavor of ginger. Definitely not a fan of that.  All in all, great service, the seafood was good in quality and taste, and the staff and decor was spectacular.",

Its a place where you can bring a date, family or just chill at the bar.  The interior design kinda suits all that.  The bartenders are very friendly and you can tell there are a lot of the same people that come to the bar because they all seem to know each other.

Okay I know Vegas is known for their AYCE sushi hot spots, but when you come here be prepared to spend $$$ cause they don't offer that. With that being said their sushi is really good and really fresh. As far as sushi goes,  I ordered their spicy tuna and cucumber rolls. The spicy tuna was on point, not too much mayo, not too much spice,  and not too much rice. The cucumber roll was just how I like it. My friend ordered their King Crab roll and she raved about it so I'll try that next time! Despite the prices,  I didn't feel like I wasted money on the sushi since it's good quality. What I do feel like I wasted my money on was their chasu ramen. I know I know,  I have no idea what I was thinking either..... In my defense I was suffering from allergies and thought soup would help. Honestly,  I've bought 0.35 cent ramen from Walmart that tasted better than what I had, and this was almost $9!!!! The broth was so watery and had no richness to it like what you would expect from real ramen. It's possible that the  soup base came from a packet that anyone could have easily found at an Asian supermarket for like $2. The noodles were also overcooked and mushy.  So please use this as a warning and skip the ramen! Go to Monta, Ramen Sora, or Fukumimi if you've got a taste for some delicious rameny goodness.  I will say that as a sushi place they've got great quality, and I look forward to coming back and exploring more of that section of the menu,  but no more ramen for me!",

I can't remember the exact name of the spicy tuna app...It tasted good but kind of difficult to eat with the egg roll crisps it comes with. I had the creamy peach saketini....I would highly recommend it!  Very smooth and delicious.  One of those \"dangerously good\" drinks!  My husband had the sangria and didn't care for it.

We've been there a couple times now and have always enjoyed ourselves.  It's a nice place to have dinner if you're planning on going to other places in Town Square.",

The edamame is fantastic, sauteed with garlic and served hot!  MY FAVORITE PART IS THE GLUTEN FREE options they provide!  Soy sauce has gluten in it and for me, I choose not to eat gluten so them having this option helps me out tremendously!  I do not think we have ever waited for a table, not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but I am happy we dont have to wait!  you can chose to sit at the bar, a table or a booth.........so nice to have those options!  You are going to be paying the average price for the rolls, nothing is over priced but it isnt super cheap. I have never had an entree, but my friends got the meal that included chicken, tempura, salad and a bowl of rice.  It looked great and was priced just right for the amount of food they received.   The waiters and waitresses have always been great. I love this place and while writing this review my mouth is watering thinking about the edamame!",

The decor is a departure from all of the strip mall sushi restaurants.  Waitstaff are on top of their game and the food is consistent. Most of the items are very good, as with most places one or two items will not be to your liking.  That is normal.  The presentation is always pleasing and the quality of food is as well. Sign up for their rewards program, the points add up fast!   One of my favorite dining spots.....",

I like that this place serves happy hour throughout the entire restaurant and not just in the bar area like almost every other place.  We ordered 1 beer, 1 hot sake, 1 calamari, 1 seaweed salad, 2 philly rolls, and 2 dragon rolls.  All of that was way more than enough for 2 people and our bill came out to about $41. Oh, and they give you free edamame.  Not bad at all for a nice, trendy restaurant! I also like that the waiter comes around to your table and tells when the last call for happy hour is.  Wish more places were like that!     I'd do it again, but I just wish happy hour lasted just a little bit longer.",

    "text": "After a long day of shopping at town square. We decided to stop by kabuki tonight for dinner, me and my family go to the kabuki in summerlin for happy hour often! WE JUST LOVE IT! But tonight is different, we decided to try out dinner this time. When we first walk in, the friendly hostess greeted us, then one hostess told us for a table of two at least a 15 minutes wait,  I think her name was spell \"Giana \"? So we thought they must be busy, after sitting at the bench less then 1 mins, another host has approach to us, and told us that our table was ready, surprise the wait wasn't even long, didn't know why we were told to wait 15 minutes. She lead us to our table, and ask how we were doing, and  if was our first time dining, we told her (her name is Catherin) that we usually go to sunmerlin location for happy hours, and never really order from dinner menu. She then smile and explain their new items on the menu and  recommended few dishes for a sushi lover like me!  Our server Kim was very sweet . She came to us  and got our drink order right away, while we were dining , she will stop by and check our table making sure we got everything we needed! Wonderful service experience I have here compare to summerlin kabuki.  The food was delicious, wasn't expecting they have many options in their menu,  they have those  tasty garlic edamame, and their bbq rib were just delicious !  Defiantly recommend to come here for their sushi, is so fresh and good amount! Worth the price, if you enjoy something spicy, try out their lotus fire roll, if you just like simple sushi, their salmon is the best! Over all the customer service was wonderful and the sushi just great! The only downside is the restroom was a little bit dirty, paper towels all over the floor, and also note to the hostess, if there is no long wait, don't make it sound like there is, if other hostess were able seat me right away, I don't see why the other one say there is a wait, and there was couple tables open. I will defiantly come here and summerlin kabuki for dinner again. I would recommend Kim as server, she just wonderful!",

I came on my birthday with friends and of coarse ordered the \"Dream Boat\"...it has everything!

I visit Town Square on a regular basis, and eagerly awaited for the grand opening of Kabuki.  My fiance and I went during happy hour and ordered their fried calamari, shrimp tempura roll, and gold rush roll.  After one bite of one of the rolls, my fiance immediately knew the sushi was no good.  I took a bite, and although it didn't taste good, I never waste sushi.  So I ate both rolls against my better judgement.  Let's just say, I had to call in sick to work the next day because of digestive problems.  I am not surprised at all that another Yelper had a similar experience!  Because of my bad experience at Kabuki, this avid sushi lover has to stay away from all things sushi related for a little while.",

Nothing worth driving across the city for, but we were in the area after going to the movies and I'm a member of the Red Mask club and I had a $15 credit for my birthday so we had dinner here tonight. Nothing exceptional except the speed of the sushi chefs. We were seated at the sushi bar because we were told there was a wait for tables (even though there were several open in the same area as the sushi bar, I guess they were claimed already). It took an exceptionally long time for our server to come back after delivering our drinks so that my dinner partner could order off the menu instead of directly from the sushi chefs, in the meantime my two rolls were already sitting in front of me. It was nice that the sushi was ready so fast but I still waited for my dinner partner to get his food so they sat untouched for quite some time. The food was good, and I'd come here again, but the overall service was slow and seemed uncoordinated.  Eventually we finished all of our food and drink and had to flag down the waiter to ask for the check, even though he had just been by to run our neighbors' check. Seemed somewhat inexperienced but weren't in a hurry so we still left a decent tip. OK food if you're in the area but nothing special.",

I recommend you join their frequent goer program, you get coupons through out the year to try new things, emails about contests and menu changes, and my personal favorite $15.00 gift card for your birthday you can use any day the month of your bday. I hate when you get coupons for places you can only use on your day, you cant do everything and eat everything in one day! When you get in there grab some garlic edamame. Its awesome and then go to town on those rolls. They are all awesome, there is nothing here I've tried and not liked. As far as the service goes, its nothing to brag about so I recommend you sit directly at the sushi bar.",

We had 4 rolls, two 22oz Beers, and two orders of hot sake in those white ceramic jars. All that for $24.54. Edamae was free for appetizer.  Simply can't beat the price. Service was friendly and the food took a bit of time, but not long considering how bus  the place was. The rolls tasted better than average and they were fresh. We had the spicy tuna roll (my fav), the scallop roll, the Philly roll, and a salmon roll. Each roll is the standard 6 pieces. Four rolls were enough for my wife and I.  This place is out a bit farther, but it's really fast to get here from anywhere on the strip. Either drive 15 mins or take a bus, the GOLD one, and it will get you there in about 20 mins. Worth the trip. The mall is packed with good stores (Apple, H&M, Blue Martini bar, Borders, etc).",

I recommend going during Happy Hour Sunday-Thursday. Their portions and quality of sushi are still the same as regular hours but for a cheaper price. Ask for a Sake Sangria. It's delicious!   I've sat at the sushi bar and a dinner table during the 3 times I've gone and I have had excellent service by the servers, manager, and sushi chefs all 3 times. Each were constantly attentive to anything I needed and made sure my plates were cleared promptly. The manager each time approached my table, asked about my experience and if I needed anything.They were quick to address anything I needed. It definitely shows that they care about their clientele. I even joined their free membership program where you can add points for discounts and free meals because I enjoyed the quality of food and service so much.   I've never sat at the bar, but I have seen people there during the late hours. You should definitely check this place out if you're at Town Square. Happy eating!",

No big deal. We got there early enough to be done before the time they would close. A person came and told us that our waitress was on break so he would take our drink order (who the hell goes on break even an hour before the restaurant was closing??). Thinking it wouldn't take long, we ordered our drinks and waited patiently. We didn't have our waitress come around to us till exactly 945. Yes. We waited that long to get service. After finally ordering, our rolls came out quick, which was nice...till I noticed that one of our orders never came. We asked the waitress about it and she told us she forgot and she would be right back. She leaves for a couple minutes and tells us she's sorry, but she forgot to enter in that order and the kitchen was closed. ARE U EFFING KIDDING ME?? I'm sorry, but I feel you should treat your last customers like your first customers. We didn't get any type sympathy comp or anything. She didn't even seem that apologetic. Needless to say, I left a pretty terrible tip in which I rarely ever do. To top it off, their sushi is pretty mediocre. I probably won't be returning to Kabuki. I will definitely stick to 808 Sushi.",

The pyramid roll which had avocado, krab and raw tuna was also good except the sauce wasnt so ok. Tasted better with the soy sauce mixed with wasabi that i dipped it in. We also had the shrimp tempura roll. Didnt have any of that cuz im allergic. The highlight was the alaskan roll. A california roll with smoked salmon on top. Really good stuff.",

We started with some hot sake, which was littler than the \"Large\" size would lead you to think. Sushi was tastier than the sukiyaki or ramen that we got. Well-seasoned sushi rice, and the fish was decently fresh. For sushi, we got the eel and avocado roll, the omakase deluxe sushi set, and then a shrimp tempura roll. Shrimp tempura roll was a little meh, but the other stuff was oishiiiii.",

When we received our food, he never refilled my drink; it was clear that my glass was empty. I had to ask other passing employees to refill my drink. He never pre-bussed our table, never checked back to see if our food was good, and I had to ask a busboy to get my check and boxes so I could get the hell out of there! When looking at the receipt, that's when I discovered our server's name; Bryan A! Bryan A, you are terrible at your job! It does not matter if this will not be your career. However, customer service skills are a foundation of whatever career path you take. I did not tip you and I'm an awesome tipper! I gave that wonderful tall busser that helped us your undeserving tip because you did not deserve my hard earned money. Good luck, cause you need it!!!!",

    "text": "So far, I've been here twice during Happy Hour and I'm a fan.  Here's a list of my favorite HH items (1st price is regular menu price, 2nd price is HH Price.  Broiled Mussel on Half Shell $6.95/$5.95 Comes with Six Mussels and they are seriously delicious made with a kind of sesame mayo sauce. I can't get enough!  Fire Cracker normally $7.95/$5.95 Spicy Tuna mixed with chopped tomato, served with egg roll chips.  This is great for sharing. Also I don't think it's as hot as it sounds. I like spicy foods but my friend doesn't and she was definitely able to eat this without issue. Sesame Chicken $7.95/$5.95  Lightly fried (tempura) chicken marinated in sesame and ginger. I originally ordered this for my friend as I wasn't sure if she would like the other dishes I chose... but this became one of my favorites after the first bite.   Calamari Rings $8.95/$5.95 This calamari is rings only, lightly battered with tempura.  Tis was ok, personally I didn't love the tempura on this dish. However my friend mentioned that the smaller pieces were better.. Some of the pieces were big and a little much for me. I'd get it again but not my 1st choice.  Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll $7.95/$5.95 Sicy Tuna, avocado and tempura crunch. This one is really good. I really like that it's spicy but not overpowering.  Another favorite roll is the Sun Kissed Roll (but it's not on the HH Menu)  Also, if you like champagne, the plum champagne drink is pretty good. Light and refreshing.   Hostess staff leaves a little something to be desired, but bar staff has been great both times. Very good about refills and making sure I have everything I need.  I'm not sure about the restaurant side, but at the bar they give out complimentary edamame. Because it's free I don't want to complain too much. It comes out cold, which is not my preference, but it also is generally a little soggy. It's definitely not terrible and both times I was there I ate a generous portion. Just doesn't excel as much as the rest of the items I've eaten.  Also, I love that you can order any roll with brown rice.",

The food was great and ambiance was pleasant, however upon returning to this location, the customer service has made up my mind that I won't be back.   While the food remained to be good, a few bad interactions killed the entire experience for me.   We arrived and to our surprise had no line ahead of us. The hostess ignored us for a while, even after I walked right up to the counter in front of her and verbalized that we would like a seat, not saying anything, she then walked away. A few moments later people started to arrive to the restaurant and she came right in and began immediately seating every group. I had to walk back up and verbalize that she should seat us, before she did so.  Once seated and already halfway through eating, we were brought out the wrong rolls upon ordering a second round of sushi. When I mentioned it to the waiter, rather than be sure we received what we wanted, he argued with me that what he brought is what I asked for and that's how it is always served. (Even though we had ordered the exact same roll at the start of our meal and got a completely different one...the right one). The waiter continued to argue with me and finally, after being told he could bring us something different and charge us for both, we sent him away, finished the food and left in a rather bad mood.  Despite the wrong food being brought out, the tools were tasty however the money paid was not worth the frustration it caused.",

Although the sushi rolls were prepared nice (and they were tasty), the teriyaki chicken was tough and overcooked and the windows in the restaurant were a mess! Is it too much to ask for a quick wipe-down of the windows before you open? It made us feel like uncomfortable!  Other than that, they serve edamame with the purchase of a sushi roll and it was tasty.  The service was great - I only had to ask for a refill once. The place wasn't approx. half-full so I'm sure service was easy to keep up with.  I'm hoping my next trip there will be cleaner and tastier. If not, it will be my last.",

Now, I should preface this with the fact that I am not a sushi eater... It's just not my thing. But, as a semi-normal human being with taste buds I can still find something on the menu I enjoy. We ended up ordering a bunch of happy hour appetizers (YES! They have happy hour!!!) and a carafe of sangria. Sadly, the only thing that has real impressive flavor was our sangria. Which was actually delicious and I would go back, but only for the sangria.   The food just wasn't anything that wowed me. There was a lot of lacking flavor that I was just expecting and excited for. It's not that the food was bad, it just want that good either. It was okay, and who wants to settle for okay? Not I. If we go to Town Square and want Asian again, we'll probably hit this place up. But, it's isn't the kind of place we'll be dying to go back to and craving.",

I never want to sit at the bar invade I don't like the roll I don't want them to see my sour face.   My server was really nice and attentive when I first sat down and then when my food came he dropped off. I've been sitting here for ten minutes waiting for a Togo box and my check. I understand he is busy with the demanding table across from me. So other than that great service.   The food was great. The fried dumplings were really good. Served on top of their sauce with some lettuce stuff in the middle. They give you complimentary edamame. Which was nice. Then my fried California roll came (I don't remember the name of it). But it was really good. I was so stuffed I only ate half and brought the other half to my co-worker. I would come back! Especially during happy hour!!!",

Probably cause it's way cheaper and it still tastes good and it's conveniently located in Town Square. Movie and happy-hour (3-6pm) dinner always sound great to me.  My last visit wasn't so hot because of their Red Mask Club system that wouldn't let me use my birthday + earned rewards. I earn the rewards from all my previous purchases and my birthday was just the annual $15 off your order. Wouldn't let me combine and then they also weren't able to put my points for that meal on either. It was quite a hassle in the end and just didn't make sense. Bleh.  Service is usually decent/mediocre. There's not really anything special about this place but for the sake of convenience and decently-priced happy hour, I do go back often enough.",

I've never been rushed through a meal like this before and we were still eating dinner when they cut the music and turned the lights on. Only reason for two stars and not one is Brandon.

The food was prepared perfectly and the service was on point from start to finish. And where else are you going to find fresh strawberry lemonade at a sushi joint that's right only here! Started off with a steak skewer and the spicy Tina on crispy rice appetizers both tasted super fresh and the sauces were perfectly matched to the flavor of the dish. For my entree I got the spider roll my gf got the pyramid they were both excellent and huge I mean these portions are great for the price I will deff be hosting some dinners with friends at this restaurant in the near future cause I think all of the people around me should be able to enjoy some awesome sushi. Also I love the fact that they encourage customer feedback any place that strives to be better should be rated fairly high on yelp and it didn't hurt that the food was just amazing from the beginning to the end.",

Never having been to Kabuki, we were unsure what to expect as some of the sushi restaurants in town offer a nice environment with terrible food and service.   Kabuki was quite the opposite (w/a very nice environment). The menu selection (including kids menu) is excellent and the sushi is melt in your mouth delicious! We had the Vegas Roll, Sunkissed Roll and the Lotus Roll. The sunkissed roll is by far my favorite and a must try for anyone thinking about trying this place out.   The service was quick and pleasant without feeling rushed. The dining room is quite large so you don't feel cramped into a small restaurant that reeks of fish. No fishy smell here! The prices are reasonable as well! With an extensive sake menu and lots more specialty rolls to try, we will definitely find something else to celebrate so that we can go back soon!",

My favorite things to eat here are the garlic edemame, tempura ice cream, and salmon terriyaki entree.  All in all I'd say 4.5 stars for the ambiance and 3 stars for the food.",

Liked the atmosphere, the conversation, and of course the food. I actually ordered a cocktail, the mango cho-hi (dangerous); sweet and un-alcohol-y tasting, just like I like em. I chose only one appetizer; although looking at the menu I could have gone for many more. I will just have to make it out to an happy hour some day. I went with the shitake tofu, very tasty; tried the crab miso (tons of crab), and my main meal was the unagi don (unagi rice bowl with avocado slices) accompanied by a salad or miso soup. I chose the salad, of course, just having downed the big bowl of crab miso. I have to admit I found the avocado slices with my eel a bit odd at first but before the meal was over, liked the melding of the two flavors. The girls had much tinier appetites than myself; J chose the sake sangria along with niku kushiyaki and the mozzarella tempura (appetizers) and M went with the salmon teriyaki luncheon special. They, too, enjoyed the look and taste of their dishes. M has been there several times. We were all in a very happy place at the end of our lunch.",

If I were to own my own japanese restaurant (which I will someday), it would totally look like this place.  I love how they had an assortment of different Japanese cuisine, most places just specialize in either just sushi, ramen, teriyaki, etc. But this place had everything. I can't remember the name of the sushi, but it had lobster in it, it was sooooooo good!!! That was the first time I had seen lobster in sushi and I thought it was amazing!!   Its located in town square so you have plenty of shops restaurants and a theater to go to when you're done. A great date place I might say.   The ramen was good too, but I dont rather lean towards Tonkatsu, but my boyfriend loved it. Great customer service as well. Looks like they employ students from the area.   This is now our favorite sushi spot in Vegas and will make it a point to come here whenever we come back.",

    "text": "Not sure what happened to this place in the last few months but it has certainly fallen off. The food has always been delicious but the service and cleanliness has taken a dive.    Management is not accommodating at all. In fact, the manager is downright rude and condescending. The hostesses trip over each other, don't acknowledge customers when you walk in and act as if they are annoyed to be working there.   The women's restroom looked like it hadn't been serviced in hours. Toilet paper on the floor, wet tiles and it reeked of urine!   After two bad experiences this month alone it's doubtful we'll be going back any time soon. What a shame.... This place used to be one of our favorites. :(",

For a Saturday night, the location was not too busy, which was very surprising to say the least, We were seated within 5 minutes. Upon being served, our server (Don't remember his name) kindly gave us our drink orders, edamame on the side to snack on, and took our order in a timely fashion.  I tried a new menu item in the pork belly bun. It was a deconstructed siopao for those familiar with Asian cuisine. It looked almost like an Asian taco, full of flavor as well. I also ordered the sunkissed roll, which contained salmon and avocado. I also ordered the California roll with baked scallops as well. We also ordered the  lotus roll on the side, and an order of their fried and grilled calamari.  Food came out very, very quickly, within 10 minutes of ordering. Our server even applauded our choice when we ordered the grilled calamari and the sunkissed roll. Some of the best flavors I have tasted.  Overall, I loved the ambiance and the decor of the place. I also loved the quality and the freshness of all the food that we ordered. I loved the attentiveness of the workers as well, and we even got a 10% discount for being LVAC members.  Highly recommend this location. Great food, amazing service, great atmosphere.",

That's it. Did our waiter do this? Any of this? No. He took our order and that was about it. We even ordered a Corona with lime, had a few sentences of a conversation about it, checked IDs, and we didn't even get it. No, we didn't remind him. That's not our job, that's his loss of tip. Then our waters ran empty and the server who brought our food came back to refill them without our asking (so appreciative!) and then he comes back after we've been done eating only because it's last call for the kitchen. Really. No. I simply asked for the check. No kidding, 8 minutes later and he brings it to us. Wow. Find another job, dude, waiting is not your calling.   What didn't make the night a complete ruin was the fact that the food came out in a good flow. It wasn't the best sushi we've had, we've enjoyed better, but it satisfied our craving.",

    "text": "During a day of errands at Fry's Electronics(love that store!), my son and I were looking for a good spot for lunch. We headed over to Town Square, to check it out, and see what they had to offer. We parked and ended up being in the middle of \"Yard House\" and \"Kabuki\". There was a kiosk in the middle of the restaurants, so i decided to get the opinion of the gentlemen hanging out there. He recommended Kabuki, and we're glad he did.  We walked in, and the place looked great. Very modern, with magnum sake bottles lining the walls of the entrance(refer to pic) and nice curved walls leading to your table.   Denise was our server. She was very nice, and full of smiles. She took our drink order and even made some chocolate milk for my son, which was greatly appreciated. After we ordered, they brought out edamame to start(refer to pic). My son has never had edamame before, but quickly fell in love with it. I love edamame, especially with a dash of salt on each. MMMmmmMMmmm... so good.    For lunch, i ordered  the \"Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll\"(refer to pic). The roll was...okay. Nothing special. The spicy sauce that was drizzled on the bottom of the plate, was by far, the best part of the dish. I also order the \"Chicken Teriyaki\"(refer to pic) from the lunch menu. It came with a bowl of \"Miso Soup\"(refer to pic), a salad and a very generous portion of chicken. The miso soup was excellent, like always. I'm a sucker for miso soup. The salad was under-dressed and could have been much better. The chicken teriyaki, on the other hand, was fantastic! That teriyaki sauce was BANGING! So delicious, i could have licked the plate.   My son ordered the #2 which is \"Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Shrimp\"(refer to pic). Once again, very generous portion size, especially for a child. I was thinking, \"i should have just got that.\". The kids #2 came with a salad, tempura shrimp and green beans, chicken teriyaki, and rice. He loved it! They also brought out \"Chop Stick Helpers\"(refer to pick). How awesome?! Now my son will be using chop sticks in no time!  Throughout lunch, Denise stopped over to check on us, refill our waters, and make small talk. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. Thanks Denise for giving us a great lunch. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "After a long day of shopping at Townsquare, a friend and I wanted to stop for a bite to eat. It was right around 4pm so we thought it would be a perfect opportunity for a \"Linner\" or \"Dunch.\" The obvious meanings of those words, for those not in the know, is the hybrid of lunch and dinner. I tell you, any excuse to eat! LOL whatever the case, we were hungry so it was time to eat. Sushi is my all time favorite meal so Kabuki was the best option for us!  Kabuki has to be one of the first restaurants when Townsquare first opened. That alone, tells me they are doing just fine. This joint is located across the street from HM and right next to Yogurtland. When you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the hostess stand. You'll then notice a very hip and modern sushi restaurant. Glass walls are painted with Kanji letters and other Japanese artwork. Lots of random posts and walls to create mini intimate dining areas. Just like any reputable sushi restaurant, there's a sushi bar for your convenience as well.  We were sat right behind the hostess station, flushed up against a shelving unit filled with various types of Sake. Our server, Angie, was super sweet. She left us alone for most of the time, but still checked up on us when we needed it. The hostess, however, was a little bit disengaged. She wasn't as personable as I hoped it to be. I know at the end there was a taller hostess that was super sweet. The one I'm talking about was a little shorter, I'd say about 5'5\". Still, that didn't ruin my time. For my meal, I decided to get the following:  -Hamachi/Yellowtail Nigiri for $4.75: the hamachi was super creamy and fresh. I loved that they gave a larger fish portion for a nigiri.   -Salmon Roll for $4.50: Salmon and cucumber rolled in rice and nori seaweed. I normally get the nigiri, but this was a great value for the price. For the roll, you get 6 cut pieces instead of 2 with the nigiri. The salmon was creamier than the hamachi and super flavorful.   -Salmon Kama(Collar) for $7.95: Whenever I visit sushi restaurants, I ALWAYS get a kama. This cut of fish is super flaky, super marbleized, grilled and flavorful and the salmon was no different. The ponzu dipping sauce brought a salty and tangy element, elevating it to new heights. Highly recommend this if you've never tried it.   The waiting time for our meals was super quick and the food was delicious. Those are reasons alone to come back time and time again. Townsquare is a place I frequent a lot, so Kabuki, watch out! I'll be back again soon. For now, thanks for the great time :)",

She was super friendly and i really enjoyed the fact that she asked us if we had any allergies she should be aware of , as many times as weve been , i dont believe we were ever asked that before. We dont have any.. but it was just a bonus on customer service. She interacted with my son as if she was a close family friend.  Definitely a plus in my books! If youre reading this Aspyn... never change!! Although i focused more on customer service in this review,  the sushi is AMAZING.  the alaskan roll is a new favorite of mine.

Maybe Los Angeles locations can help you have better quality sushi.  The table booths seem dirty. The walls are nasty looking. The little glass separators always have finger prints.

It won't be the absolute best restaurant, but it's solid, and pretty fail-safe. The large menu caters to many tastes - the reasonable prices and large servings make for great, casual lunch specials, while the full-blown sushi menu will satisfy fish junkies too. There'll always be something for any mood.    Well, for any of my friends' moods, at least. I have culinary tunnel-vision at Kabuki, and will only order specials that include their teriyaki chicken (which is delicious, and amazing, and delicious again), so I can't vouch for anything else myself, but so far, my companions have always seemed happy with their many different orders. In particular, they swear by the freshness of the tuna and salmon, they like the rolls, and we appreciate how even the smallest side dish is pretty good on its own.   The staff is friendly and attentive, and service is very fast considering how busy it gets. The restaurant has excellent ambiance; it's classy enough for a dinner date, but casual enough that you could just drop by mid-day for some teriyaki chicken. No, seriously, it's sweet and moist and uncomplicated and all the things you want it to be, so go get some and be filled (big portions!) with happiness.",

Our bill came to $170 plus we tipped him $32, but not going to come back here again. The food was tasty but our service was disappointing. He also forgot to put a roll in so we asked him about that too and he said he forgot and brings it out when we are going to pay and doesn't even Comp it! Wow! Rookie service for sure!",

The Miso Black Cod was excellent.  Wonderful delivery packaging, the gyoza appeared in a attractive box, that looked like I had ordered a nice box of chocolates. They provide wasabi soy dipping bowls which is always a win when you are traveling.  Kabuki delivery via Eat24 or Seamless sure beats hotel room service.",

The best place to park is in the back by H&m, since it's right across. BTW.. Its really a great H&M but go before kabuki because you will be too full to try on that cute pair of pants.  If you are coming with someone who doesn't like sushi, there are plenty of other options. The sukiyaki is a good alternative and filling or the chicken fingers.   We really like the agedashi tofu here.  If tofu scares you, just try the agedashi. It's crispy on the outside and sits in a well seasoned broth. It's amazing.. Just try it.  You can't go wrong at this place especially at happy hour.",

I was meeting my friend here for a late lunch and was immediately greeted by the host person. Not sure how busy it gets during actual dinner or lunch time but it was quite dead during the happy hour time.. Which is perfect! A quiet and peaceful place.   Kim, our waitress, was very kind and accommodating to our needs. I ordered the Dynamite Roll along with some Salmon nigiri off the happy hour menu which was very good. I really like the Dynamite Roll here and one order was satisfying enough.  We also ordered hot sake (for a first-timer, I did not like it LOL), and then cold white rice sake which had a sweeter taste. I would recommend the cold sake for anyone who isn't a huge fan of hard liquor. Taking the hot sake was like a shot for me... had to down it and made a disgusting squinty face haha. But it was off the happy hour menu so worth the try :) The presentation of the cold sake was cool. It was given in a bucket of ice to keep cool.  The sashimi salad was also a great dish. This is a hit or miss for me because most restaurants seem to lack sashimi pieces. Maybe because we came during a slower hour, but they were generous with the sashimi pieces.  I would recommend hitting this place up during a happy hour as I think their happy hour menu does have a lot to offer for a decent value.",

They were Japanese and I loved the food every time I was lucky enough to be invited. This Sukiyaki was really good. The vegetables were cooked just right and the beef and noodles rounded out the dish (bowl). The flavors mixes together to make it a wonderful dish. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

If you are looking for a chill somewhat classy kind of dinner night but don't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money this is the spot! Service here was great servers always checking on their tables and everyone is in a great mood.",

Of course their sushi is good here and the service is really good too. The food came out quickly and the servers were really kind. Our drinks were always refilled without having to flag one of the staff down.   My friends and I were really lucky to walk in during Happy Hour, and surprisingly it wasn't even that busy. No complaints for me though because the food was cheaper and the food came out fast!",

Staff was friendly, service was excellent! Our drinks were never empty, our food came out quickly and was correct.  It was our first time here. We ordered three different sushi rolls, spicy ramen, garlic edamame and pork gyoza to try a little bit of everything. The ramen was ok, good for a place that is not primarily a ramen spot. I asked for a side of butter and minced garlic to dr up the ramen.  The garlic edamame was excellent!  Seating was comfortable. We were in a 1/2 booth 1/2 table. They had full booth and traditional table & chairs for larger parties.",

    "text": "Not all sushi is equal, and if you enjoy specialty rolls you'll really want to do your research when selecting a sushi restaurant. We came here because we had picked up a friend at the airport, and were looking for lunch somewhere off-strip. This location is in Town Square.  The service was good and the staff was pleasant. We tried the garlic edamame and several of their specialty rolls. The edamame was good - a bit different from versions elsewhere. There were large pieces of garlic and what seemed like maybe almond slivers or something - it was crunchy. It was a nice contrast without being overly garlic in flavor.  The specialty rolls were all very good, although they were unique and not exactly what I would expect from a Japanese restaurant:  The Lobster Roll: 5 pieces of a California roll covered in big chunks of lobster in a sauce. The serving of lobster was generous, but I found the lobster to be a little chewy. I also found that the presentation made it difficult to get equal amounts of lobster on every serving. It tasted good, but I probably would not order this roll again.  The Lasagna Roll: 8 pieces of what I recall being a California roll, covered in mounds of cheese... yes cheese. Sounds strange I know, but this was amazing! I would order this over and over. It was listed on their specialty menu, so I am not certain that this is a year round offering. But it was probably our favorite roll. It was warm and creamy.  The Dragon Roll: I loved the tempura jalapenos on this! My friend worried that this roll would be too spicy for him (I happen to love spicy), but it was perfectly balanced and not too hot at all. The spicy tuna caked on top of the roll, with the addition of a little cream cheese was just the right amount to cool off any spiciness. I would order this again.  The Lava Roll: I am on the fence with how I feel about this roll. It had a good flavor, but it had tons of mushrooms and onion strings under clumps of mozzarella cheese. Definitely not what you'd expect with sushi, and although it tasted good, I don't think I'd order it again... it was A LOT of onions.  I do think I'll come back here, both because it's conveniently located, and because the service and food were both good. But there wasn't one stand out item we tried that will make me rush to come right back.",

    "text": "I've been here before.  The food is decent.  It'll take care of your sushi fix for a little.  Was there a couple days ago and had an OK meal.  First off, the \"little plates\" are not little.  They are big servings enough for a meal for one person.  They are NOT tapas sized.  You'll order too much if you get a few.  Wish our waiter told us this, but he sucked.  Very little help from him.  Maybe he was new.  Don't know.  Don't care.  The best little plate was the tuna collar.  Amazing.  That's all you need if you're getting lunch.  The sushi was OK.  I expected that though because this is a chain restaurant I believe.  So no disappointment.  The ramen SUCKED.  I took three bites.  A gave the full bowl for my waiter to clean up.  I told him it didn't taste good at all.  I didn't expect a free bowl or discount, but at least acknowledge it.  Nope.  He didn't.  This added to his suckery.  After we finished, we waited for about twenty minutes for him to come by and give us the tab.  I had to flag down the busboy and even the hostess.  The busboy was the nicest one.  The restaurant wasn't packed and maybe they were understaffed, but 25 minutes to get your bill is a long time.  I still left a tip for the SUCKY (or is that SUCKEY)waiter.  On the bright side, the iced water was amazing even if it did probably come from the tap.  Would I go back?  Only if I forgot that I wrote this review.",

I try my best to come during Happy Hour (3:00-6:00pm, M-F)  so I can get some cheap sides with my Tonkotsu ramen. This past Friday, I decided to give their Happy Hour sushi a whirl. They really only had some pretty basic rolls on the menu (not too surprised by that) and yet, it ended up about the same price as AYCE elsewhere. Bummer...",

I've eaten sushi at far more expensive places and had less quality food than what I always get at Kabuki. I typically go for the rolls here. (Lotus, Lotus on Fire, Dynamite) I don't like a lot of rice in my rolls and I prefer my rolls made from brown rice. And wouldn't you know it, this is not a problem for them! In fact its a regular way of having your rolls made. Nothing that they charge you extra for. And they don't pretend its overly difficult.   I eat a lot of business meals here and my clients are always happy. Even the ones that don't like seafood. (They make great teriyaki chicken and miso soup. Among other things.). So if you are looking for consistently good food at fair prices.. this is a great place.",

I recommend the Vegas Roll, California Tempura Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Sweet Potato Fries, and Tokyo Quesadilla. I've taken family there and everyone ends up enjoying it and wanting to go back for more. The service is usually very good, but like every restaurant they have some off days. I stopped by with some family on Christmas Day and it seems like they were not expecting it to be so busy because the service was exceptionally slow, not a big deal for me because we already knew what we wanted and did not need too much attention from our waiter. Overall it is a great restaurant and I recommend going!",

Maybe I'm spoiled after living in SF for 10 years and having some great sushi. Or maybe this place just doesn't get it. One of the more important components of a roll is the rice. It has to be perfectly sticky & be consistent in the \"hold the roll\" department. Both locations failed miserably at the rice. It's the basic component if this meal! The rice was either brittle, dry & fell apart or it was cold, rubbery & BLEH!  Once the rice thing fell apart, it was pretty much downhill from there with flavoring & consistency. However, service at both locations was good and pleasant, our Town Square experience with Ana was great!",

There was a good amount of vegan options for me and the husband and plenty for our meat eating friends. So it was a perfect choice.   Personally I had the tofu rolls which were on point! And the tofu steak with a really good sauce, it also came with great steamed veggies. We also got a rainbow veggie roll... And while it was a little on the spicy side... The husband loved it. Also had a gimlet that was perfect.",

Although I was a little upset that I paid $12.00 for 3 chunks of tuna and a handful of imitation crab I'd give this place another shot.

I thought both rolls were good.  I substituted imitation crab meat from the shrimp in the first roll. I thought the scallop in the second roll was overcooked and the onions undercooked (they were still pretty crunchy and had the raw onion taste that didnt go well with the roll).  My friend had a cali roll and the shrimp tempura roll. She said both were fine.  There was nothing spectacular about this place, but next time I go to Vegas (and if I'm in the area) I might give it another go (and dine in) to see if may be they just had an off day.",

The service on the other hand has hiccuped more than thrice... tonight was no exception.   NOTE TO HOSTESS: if you're getting slammed and are short staffed, say so. if there are 5-6 open tables and you're not seating anybody, it is not because there are two couples waiting to be seated that there is a 20 minute wait, its because you're in the weeds and you might not know what to do in this situation because this might be your first job.... and that's cool. Just lose the attitude and help find solutions rather than spend energy trying to assign blame.   Happy hour specials rock. quality of food is surprisingly good, but i do echo other reviewers in that the roll menu is a bit thin. However, the nigiri portions are pretty large and the ahi tuna is usually a nice rich deep pink/purple. I never get any fishy tasting portions which has been a staple of almost eery other place i've been in vegas.",

It did it's job for Happy Hour and I think that would be the ONLY time that I'd come here. Although they limit as to what is on their HH menu, there is a pretty nice selection and I was pretty happy with what I had. I had about 4 or 5 (?) Lychee drinks (alcoholic beverages that I can't remember for the life of me what they call them) and about 2-3 spicy tunas @ $2.50 or $3 each,... Man, I should try to stay sober so I can write these reviews accurately! Wth...   Anyway, this is a great place for HH if you're looking to get some kinda sushi fix.

It's good to see someone that really knows what they are serving. Thank you for taking care of me and my family especially on sons special day! We would give you 10 if we could!",

    "text": "Good food, dismal experience otherwise.   I came in from out of town for New Year's to visit my sister and her boyfriend, who live in Henderson. They love Kabuki back from when they lived in So Cal. I wanted to treat them to a nice NYE meal, so we made reservations here, which were available on Open Table at 815, 830, and 845.  Our reservations were for 815 but we were running 15 min late so I called ahead. I was assured it was no problem, though was also advised that they had \"last call\" for both food and drink at 845, which seemed odd since their last res was for 845.   Upon our arrival, the hostess looked a bit put out and reminded us of the 845 \"last call\", but also assured us that we were welcome to stay in the restaurant as long as we liked so as to not feel rushed. We were quickly able to give our drink order and our server came by about 5 minutes later. We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of, including all sushi/rolls, etc. This turned out fine, but I didn't appreciate having to order everything up front.  Our server was polite, but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down, to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food, our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle \"out of the way\" - to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner. He then dropped the bill off a very short time later. Having felt rushed from the moment we entered the restaurant, I asked to speak with the manager. She assured we could stay \"as long as we liked\", though didn't so much as offer any apology for our treatment - quite frankly, she was probably directing them to close as quickly as possible.  The 2-stars was because the food was quite good, otherwise it would've been one star. I don't understand for the life of me why a restaurant would advertise having reservations available on any night, let alone NY Eve, up until 845 when they're closing at 9pm - and won't offer any additional access to food or drink after 845. I haven't felt this unwelcome in a restaurant for years, if ever. Very disappointing experience for us all, and they've now lost my sister and her bf as customers as well.",

    "text": "Second time here and it's just as great as the first time. The mozzarella tempura was surprisingly light and very flavorful. The yellow tail carpaccio was so fresh. I had a geisha roll, pyramid roll and a salmon roll. All were so tasty with wonderful presentation. The seaweed salad was equally tasty. The service was good and the atmosphere had just the right vibe. Overall I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other temping sounding things on their menu. I give it 4 1/2 stars. Half a star off for the paper napkins we were given. Every other table seemed to have linen ones.  Strange",

    "text": "DELICIOUS.  A short drive away from the strip, but way way worth it! Here's what I had:  1. Deep fried calamari with eel sauce. Perfectly crunchy, not too chewy. It was the perfect start to a good meal. 2. Spicy ramen. This broth was really tasty. I've eaten at many ramen joints, but this broth is actually quite spectacular and savory and complex. It wasn't at my desired spiciness level, but the waitress left a bottle of ground chili to bring it to my liking. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but definitely wished there was a piece of char siu in it, or some kind of meat. 3. Sunkissed roll. Spicy tuna roll with salmon and avocado on top. This was my favorite dish of the meal. I am a huge fan of sashimi and fresh fish. The spicy tuna was okay, but what made me happy and brought me joy was the huge piece of fresh and tasty raw salmon atop the roll. Certainly some of the freshest salmon I've tasted.  I was so happy with this meal, especially having been deprived of good sushi for about half a year. The total for the ramen and roll was ~$22. Definitely a steal compared to those other pricey places on the strip.",

    "text": "In reality, this review should either be FOUR STARS or ONE.  Let me explain....  Over the last decade, restaurants have developed a new method of food delivery to the table.  I call this person the \"Food Bringer\".  This is the person you've never seen before who shows up 15 minutes after you've ordered from your waiter/waitress and puts your food in front of you.  Good restaurants pull this stunt off seamlessly.  They have to!  When you send a complete stranger to a guests table with their food you had better have a system in place to ensure food arrives at the correct table and is placed in front of the correct person.  Bad restaurants don't properly train the \"Food Bringer\".   The \"Food Bringer\" wanders out with trays of expensive Oriental food and just tosses it on the first table that looks hungry.  This is what happened to us tonight... at this location.  Side Note:  Our waitress, JULIE, was phenomenal.  Management: give her a raise as she's one of the reasons you didn't get a ONE star rating.  The \"Food Bringer\" came out bearing heaping amounts of delicious entrees and placed them haphazardly in front of my family.  Being the hill folk we are, my clan was all over this bounty like a pack of wolves on a three-legged cat.  Julie came rushing over and informed the \"Food Bringer\" of his mistake and he proceeded to load the food back onto the trays, turn 180 degrees to his right, and deliver the food to it's rightful owner.... the people sitting RIGHT next to us.  I'm a little confused at this point.  What's going on?  We arrived first and this \"looked\" like our meal.  It wasn't.  A different \"Food Bringer\" showed up with our correct meal and we managed to help him locate each meal's rightful owner.  One plate in the middle of the table stood out... It was a Tempura Shrimp and Veggie plate that should have gone next door but remained on our table and was being devoured by hungry children.  One more note... my Autistic son managed to grab the croutons from the salad put briefly on our table just prior to it being moved next door.  So, the couple next to us received a meal that was not only missing their Tempura order, but was sans two croutons from a now compromised salad.  Let's move on.  The tables are too small.  Period.  We ordered three entrees to share between four people.  There was NOT enough room for our food.  Plates were hanging precariously over the sides.  Also, in a nice restaurant, the tables should be adjusted daily to make sure they don't \"wobble\" back and forth.  Maybe that's what the chop-sticks are for?  The food?  Pure Heaven!  That's why this SHOULD be a four star review.  Had it not been for small, wobbly tables and untrained \"Food Bringers\", that's exactly what this restaurant would have received.  If I went back, I would not take my children (even though they liked the food) and stick to a twosome.  That would leave ample room on the table for the... FOOD!  Second, I would CHECK the table to make sure it's square with the floor.   Tighten the screws Kabuki.  Your restaurant is beautiful and the food is fantastic.  Fix these issues and I'll amend this review.",
