I asked why so blan, they replied that some people were complain it was too spicy and salty. So instead they let you add your finishing touches.  The broken rice dishes was the best in town and have earned our business if we are craving rice.  As for the other dishes we haven't tried yet, but will soon.",

It was like having a native of a cuisine show you the ropes.  I was here with a group and we got and shared many dishes. For appetizer we got a fried shrimp dish. I wish I could tell you the name but the online menu is down and quite frankly I don't remember. It was really delicious. We were able to make a sauce to dip it in and they had the sauce and peppers and seasoning so you could make your sauce as hot or mild as you liked it. You can use this same sauce on rice when your rice dish arrives.  The Bun bo hue was great and the entree I got \"broken rice with chinese sausage\" was good as well. Only thing to mention though is the portions are VERY generous. We ended up stuffed beyond belief and I felt bad that we had to essentially trash a lot of really good food.   Only thing that is kinda weird about this place is the bathroom is OUTSIDE the restaurant lol. You have to walk out the back and go down an outdoor hallway to use the bathroom.",

The pho was actually not too bad, maybe 4/5 stars because the smell and taste was too bold and the price is above average.   But man, the service here is TERRIBLE. My party of 8 arrived at around 1:30pm and we told them it was ok to split us to separate tables of 4 ppl if it would be more convenient. So my party got split, but that doesn't change the fact that it still took half an hour to get our food even though we ordered right away. It should not take more than 10min to bring out a bowl of pho. We were never checked on again. And after all that they STILL charged our two SEPERATE tables the 15% gratuity, even though we weren't even seated near each other or at the same time.   Tl;dr Don't come here unless you have a small group of people with hours to kill. The food might be worth the money, but the experience is not.",

So we drove down the street and found Pho Bosa -- best decision ever.  We liked it so much, we ate here on the first day coming in AND on the last day leaving Vegas.  (Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you!)  The pho broth here may be the most flavorful I have ever had.  So savory, packed with so much seasoning and tang.  I did a few squirts of Hoisin sauce and Sriracha sauce just out of habit but it was utterly unnecessary.  The soup just stood on its own.  Pho noodles were beautifully cooked, meat was lean, lender and fresh.  My only compliant was that I got to the bottom of the bowl too quickly, and I'm pretty sure the portions are on par with everywhere else.  We also got egg rolls and this spring roll with Vietnamese sausage and dipping sauce.  SO GOOD!  I'm totally salivating while typing this.    I have eaten a lot of pho at a lot of places.  Mainly in Los Angeles where Vietnamese cuisine is competitive.  Pho Bosa is up there with the best of them.",

I ordered #73 which was brisket and need balls and I have to say this place is number 1 so far here in Las Vegas. I loved the soup and the noodles. Everything was so fresh and super clean. They give you tons of napkins and the cold water with lemon keels flowing instead of waiting 10-15 min for another fill up. I just hope one day this establishment will stay opener later.   Also for checking in they have a $2.99 coupon for a dessert and it's for a limited time only. I didn't get a chance to use it but next time I will if they still have the offer.",

Who cares if your car gets keyed while you're slurping down your delicious bowl of pho. :)  We randomly swung into this pho restaurant one late afternoon while we were in Vegas for the 2013 Olympia Expo. Upon parking and walking in, you seriously feel like you're either gonna catch an STD or probably shot up but rest assured, neither of the two happened to us. :)  Even though the interior is dark, dreary, run-down, surprisingly the scary restroom located outside the restaurant was uber clean. Haha!  I ordered a nice big bowl of Bun Rieu cuz I wasn't in the mood for pho. Have to admit, one of the best damn bowls of Bun Rieu I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant. The SBBF ordered himself some pho and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  Customer service was on point. I like the fact that there was some random Hispanic guy who spoke perfect English who greeted us goodbye after we paid.   Definitely a must-go if you want cheap, good Vietnamese food near the strip!",

I heard about this place but never took the time to actually go there since there aren't really any quality vietnamese restaurants in this town, so you can say that I gave up hope. Being half vietnamese myself and having a personal love and affection for vietnamese cuisine this place has rejuvenated my hopes again. My friend suggested this place last night so off we went and I had the Bun Rieu (personal favorite of mine) and holy sh!t was it delicious. As the waitress brought out my bowl I could smell that delicious broth from 10ft away, now that's saying something. Very rich broth and strong aroma, as well as a decent amount of the meat. I have to say that I was genuinely impressed. I will definitely be coming back very soon, probably tonight :)   On to the other things, prices are reasonable considering how many viet establishments are on spring mountain. Service was suprisingly really good, almost like we were eating at an american restaurant. Usually service in these types of asian restaurants I have found to be horrible or subpar in my past experiences, definitely a plus for me. Restaurant is very clean, which is good. Interior in my opinion is very bland, almost feels like im eating at someones home where they just moved in so there is nothing inside but furniture. Could definitely use more life/flavor and interior decorations. Some viet music playing in the background would also be nice (they have the speakers installed.....) But I understand that this is a new location so maybe they will improve? Regardless of all that this place for me still deserves 5 stars, the most important aspects of food quality, customer service, and cleanliness have been checked off in my book. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Check it out, and maybe i'll see you there!",

Our server asked if it was our first time there (which it was) and explained the full menu to us. He was very knowledgeable and gave some on point recommendations.  We ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien which is pho with rare steak and beef balls. Delicious as expected. I also tried Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle) which definitely hit the spot for me! I highly recommend it for first timers! Don't forget to try their shrimp cake! Everything came out fresh and with great service, we'll be back for sure!",

They had the pho with everything in it and I had grilled pork chops with a fried egg. Both were really flavorful!!!   Service was great too  Mimi was our server. She was super pleasant and was very attentive to us. Great customer service. I am definitely coming bacj the next time im un town.   I say to be like Nike and just do it... eat at Bosa!",

Located ~1.5 mil from the strip, this is pretty easy to get to via taxi/uber/walking etc.   I've only had the pho and it's more than enough. The broth is flavorful and they give a pretty substantial amount of beef. There is only one size and is probably a decent amount for a guy but could even be too much for some. Not much more to say about the food but...  The service is pretty mediocre. For pho, the wait is WAY too long. We even had to flag someone down just to get our food ordered in the first place. Pho should come out of the kitchen pretty quick and yet we found ourselves waiting a good 15 min and it wasn't even that busy in the restaurant. Nevertheless, I'll likely be back...",

This was like a pulsing, I hate myself for drinking so many Vodka-Redbulls, have to drive 4 hours back to So-Cal type hangover. It was friggin' bad. So I've known that pho is a good call for aiding hangovers.   I was less than excited to try and find a place located on the strip or in one of the main hotels. I was in no mood to deal with busy streets, people and parking. Pho Bosa is located far enough so you won't have to deal with this kind of stuff, but close enough so you don't have to drive far from where you may be staying (if on the strip). I stayed at the Venetian and this was less than a 5 minute drive from there.   When arriving here, we were sat immediately and had our order taken within minutes. Between my girlfriend and I, we shared the Smokey Oxtail Pho and two waters. We put an Emergen-C vitamin supplement in one of the waters (for the hangover). The Oxtail soup came out shortly and was amazing! It was hands down one of the top 3 bowls of pho that I've had. The amount of meat provided from the oxtail was plenty, and the large size bowl for both of us was more than enough to take leftovers, which we did. The service was quick and friendly, order taking was quick and the check was taken care of even quicker. I will definitely return to this place when I visit Vegas again.  As for the hangover. This Oxtail Pho, plenty of water, one Emergen-C, and one Drinkade hangover recovery drink got me feeling better within an hour. Come to this place for some epic pho and also a great aid for gnarly hangovers.",

So sick that she couldn't leave the hotel room and we couldn't help her because we were all working.  I called Pho Bosa to see if they deliver.  They didn't =(  I explained the situation to them and they agreed to deliver for a small fee.  They drove it to the Four Seasons and delivered it straight to her room.  Needless to say, she was bright eyed and bushy tail the next day at work and was convinced the pho speeded her recovery.  She was fine for the entire week.  Oh, and she said the food was GREAT!

I like this new location compared to the old one BC parking is convenient and the restaurant is larger but still quaint.  The Bun Rieu is in the $9.00 range but the flavor and ingredients are top notch. Generous amounts of crab meat, tomato's, yummy noodles and a killer hroth. Service from the male waiter and I think owners husband is friendly and speaks Vietnamese but sure doesn't look Vietnamese.

Located just a block before all the pho king longs and the pho me toos and whatever clever name you can think of that's pho related. When you arrive, you may think you're at the wrong location because the plaza looks deserted. Sure enough, you are in the right location.  The food is legit! The quality of the food is what makes it legit. You go to these other popular places full of drunks or the aftermath-hangovers it's loud and busy. But Pho Bosa, you won'y find that. It's much smaller so they are more attentive. The lady was even willing to customize a plate for one of us. Normally rice dishes take longer than the other items on the menu. We didn't have to wait for that dish before everyone can start eating.  I'm definitely making this my to-go place for pho whenever I'm in Vegas and if you're part of the crew, I'll make a fan out of you.",

I had the bun bo hue again, but this time it was less spicy, with less noodles (that were too soft), and no pork blood cubes. Also the beef slices were too hard, but the tendon and pork hock was nice and tender.  We also got two com dishes. The egg rolls are very thin and hardly any filling. The egg quiche is dry and bland. Huge mound of rice though!  I also got my favorite drink, the salted lemonade, but they didn't make it salty. Too sweet. It was $3 for a small foam cup mostly filled with ice.  So for $75 for 6 people and small portions. Also consider that two of the people were 6 and 11 yrs old that hardly eat. The adults ate all the food the kiddos didn't bc there wasn't enough on our dishes to satisfy; even grandma who barely eats was eating off of the kiddo's plate.  Overall, they don't offer anything that I can't make better at home. But this place is def better than Viet Bistro.",

Two of us ordered the pho (with meat balls and rare steak), one ordered broken rice with chicken and one ordered beef stew which was off the menu. Everything was delicious, particularly the beef stew. If you're looking for great eats just off the strip I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "My wife is Vietnamese and whenever we are in Las Vegas (2-3 times a year) we invariably get burned out on all The Strip restaurants and buffets during our stay. That's when we head down Spring Mountain Road to Pho Bosa.  No matter what day of the week or what time of day or how busy Pho Bosa is, we can always get a table without much of a wait.  I usually have a big bowl of Beef Pho and my wife gets a rice dish and we add one of the noodle dishes. The food is always fast to come out of the kitchen and the order is always right.   The servers/staff seem to have sort of assigned areas/station but actually they all take care of any table they pass, if you need anything.  The prices are not super cheap but the servings are ample and the quality is excellent. The food is delicious and authentic. So, I consider Pho Bosa an excellent value based on all merits.  It's amazing that I see some low reviews of Pho Bosa here on Yelp because I haven't experienced a bad meal there. I am either very lucky or the other folks here on Yelp are unlucky or perhaps people were in a bad mood on both sides of the table. Maybe it wasn't their day but for me; I love Pho Bosa.",

I was attracted to this place due to the fact that they have nem nuong on the menu, but came to soothe my hang over with some soup. We ordered the bun bo hue, bun rieu, nem nuong, and egg rolls. First off let me say, this vietnamese joint has the best I mean the best service any vietnamese restaurant has to offer. Our waitress was nice, attentive, and didn't have his thumb in my soup when he dropped it off. We actually got our waters filled without having to wave someone down. The fact that he treated us with such great service and knowing that we are not regulars made me become more of a fan. The nem nuong was rolled freshly when we ordered and came out quickly. It was very good. The dipping sauce was on point. The egg rolls came with noodles, lettuce and vietnamese herbs to roll and dip. They gave us individual sauce bowls so there will be no double dipping. I got the bun bo hue and my soup came out super hot which I loved. The broth was amazing, just the right amount spice, good meat to noodles ratio. I usually have to add so much to my broth to make it the way I want it. But not with this place, all I had to do was add my herbs and veggies and eat. I tasted my hubs bun rieu and that too was amazing. I'm really glad I found out about this place, this will be our new to go to place when we're in Vegas. Btw everything is made fresh to order so there might be a wait for your food. But who cares about 15 mins when you get amazing food and service.",

BIGGEST COMPLAINT:   The bill they give you is vague and primitive. There are NO item descriptions, just prices. Also, if you are in a party of 5 or more, there is a 15% service fee (which is just manually calculated and scribbled in there).   If eating in large parties with many orders, be SURE to double check all prices very carefully. Considering many people are in Vegas are tourists, you may be drunk/ hungover and not notice that you were charged extra for something you did not order.  Summary:   We felt very ripped off after eating here in terms or portions and taste. Then we really got ripped off when I paid the bill (our fault for not thoroughly reviewing the bill).",

However, don't overlook Pho Bosa, this place is authentic and worth making a trip to!!    Noodle soup is the perfect comfort food after a long night of partying but when you pair it with such great flavors as to what Pho Bosa offers, you don't need a drunken/hung over reason to come here.  We ordered both the Bun Rieu and Bun Bo Hue and they were both stellar, reminds me of the ones that I have had at my friends' houses growing up.  Super authentic, you can taste the hours spent making the broth.  Don't forget to order the Nem Nuong Cuon (pork spring rolls), they were sooooo good and it's not often that you can find the crispy crunchy skin in all spring rolls.  Deeeeelicious!   Service was super warm and friendly, we were checked on several times.  Plus, prices here are more than reasonable.  It beats paying $15+ for a bowl of pho on the strip.  The next you are in Vegas, make a trip over to Spring Mountain Rd. and give Pho Bosa a try!  Don't forget to come early tho, the restaurant itself is relatively small and gets packed fast.",

The old BBC was more hip/contemporary and modern and they exclusively served sandwiches and drinks.    Then, without notice, they shut down and moved and merged business and operations with Pho Bosa on a dingy corner strip mall on Valley View and Twain.  The location move was a, for lack of a better word, downgrade.    Pho Bosa is very unappealing from the exterior and just your regular pho shop.  I got lost the first time I came here.  The interior is a bit dark and need some additional lighting.   They also have different product placements all over the dining hall.  I thought I saw one about meditation and massage.    First time, I meant to order the brisket bahn mi but changed my mind when I saw the table next to me having nem nuong cuon so I followed suit, and also ordered a com dish with grilled pork,  and Vietnamese iced coffee.  That was a bad last minute decision change.  Neither the pork sausage rolls nor the rice dish impressed me.  The nem nuong was not even half close to Brodard's and the rice dish was just ok.    I vowed to stick with and only order their Beef Brisket bahn mi from then on.  So, yes am a fan of their Bahn mi and iced coffee.  The rest of their dishes on their menu?  meh!   They concoct their own light amber-colored fish sauce which is not very salty and not as pungent and fishy like most fish sauces are.  They're very good and perfect for dipping and seasoning and are on the table with the rest of the condiments, and if it wasn't for the size of the bottle, you'd be tempted to swipe and run with it.",

They used EDC as an example of why they don't split the checks. They get huge groups and it takes to long to do so, so they just stopped it all together.",

    "text": "Amazing pho about 10 mins by car from the Strip. The portion sizes are HUGE, the broth is so hearty and flavorful I almost teared up. I got the #7 and the  bowl was good enough for two full meals. They also have this chili sauce I've never had that was so amazing . Their banh mis are the BEST I've ever had and came out super quickly. The only negative thing I have to say was that we had to wait 15-20 mins for our soup which might've been the longest I've ever had to wait for pho. They also seemed pretty understaffed, I had to hunt down waiters to get our check. It was definitely worth the wait but they should add one or two more waitresses or chefs to speed up the process because a lot of people in the restaurant were waiting for a while too. Still 10/10 would recommend because the food is that good but I do wish it was quicker.",

    "text": "Wow. Just wow. With any Pho / Vietnamese restaurant I'm very used to the typical broth and meats. I was in the area with my family as we were getting our tires and air filter changed. It was about 11am when our service was completed so we were hungry. Unfortunately most lunch places aren't open until noon, but luckily we stumbled upon Pho Bosa. Now what makes Pho Bosa different from other Pho places? Well, they have signs everywhere advertising their smoked oxtail Pho and smoked short ribs Pho. When it comes to Pho the three main things that are most important to me are the broth, meat, and noodles. I chose the classic combination Pho and my sister chose the oxtail Pho. When our orders arrived I got a spoon and tried the broth and it instantly blew me away.  Never in my life have I ever had Pho broth that had a SMOKEY flavor. That Smokey broth also enhanced the flavors of the meats inside the bowl. The portion sizes are large and you definitely get your money's worth. What surprised me even more is that they also have garlic Parmesan fries and garlic Parmesan tater tots and even brisket grilled cheese. LIKE WHAT? This is the most unique pho joint I have ever been to. Here comes the hard part. As much as I would love to give this place 5 stars, there were some down sides. First the place is very inconvenient to get to and the parking is very limited and second of all the service was quite poor. We were never really checked on and had to catch a waitress to take our order. Also, if you check in you get $1 off the matcha Thai tea yet the match Thai tea isn't on the menu so I have no clue if I ever got my $1 off. Overall this is definitely a very unique pho place and I will definitely be returning back because the broth is just AMAZING.",

I admit I overlooked this place but never again! The drive is worth it!   First thing that I want to emphasize is the staff! Immediately when I walked in I was greeted with some excitement and appreciation from a lady and gentleman. I'm assuming this is a family owned business as they seem to be running the show. As I sat and looked through the menu I could hear them greet their repeated guest. Always with a smile and excited to be able to serve them again. This is when I realized I'm going to immediately enjoy my experience. When owners genuinely appreciates a new comer the same way they appreciate their regular customers gives me a sense of happiness. This let's me know the business is more than just a building it's a place to build long lasting relationship and memories.  Now let's get down to business! Let's talk about what we came here for which is the Pho! This place provides a huge bowl of Pho! One of the biggest servings here in Las Vegas so if your hungry this will definitely fill your empty stomach! I ordered the Oxtail Pho and boy was my tummy happy! The Oxtail was nice and soft! It was so soft it was falling of the bone! The broth was outstanding! It definitely stood out and differentiated itself from other Pho's I have tried in the valley!   They serve specialty drinks here such as the cococane which is sugar cane with coconut. This drinks was so good! It was very refreshing and had such an addicting factor that makes you want to keep drinking. It felt like my body was getting all the nutrition needed to get rehydrated! This drink is a must in my opinion. Only place I know that serves it.  By the time I was done eating I looked up and the whole restaurant was packed with people! People having great conversations and enjoying their meal! Love places that makes a person feel that way. I'm 100% going to come back to try more of their other Pho's and their sandwiches!",

It sits in a random strip mall with a bar next to it in the beginning of China town away from all the other restaurants, also the bathroom is located outside which can be kind of annoying especially in the summer. Everyone says the pork sausage rolls are good so we ordered those along with Pho Tai for me and Bun Bo Hue for my love.   The Nem Nuong Rolls were really good and they had a good crunch to them. The sauce it was served with disagreed with my tastebuds and was not appetizing. My pho tai broth was not good either. The broth tasted really different. Not a different taste that I enjoyed. Even after adding plenty of line the broth was just weird. I don't know how to explain lol. I didn't however enjoy the meat they out in. Tasted like good quality and they have a good portion of both rare steak and noodle. My fiance enjoyed his bun bo hue but it wasn't his favorite either. Overall this place is ok but not my favorite pho place. The spring rolls saved this meal but it's not enough to keep me coming back.",

I was surprised they didn't offer more dessert variety.

    "text": "So I came across this place because yelp said this one of the best rated pho places in LV. When I rolled up to this joint, it was sooo sketchy looking. The parking was pitch black, no light poles in the parking lot. The restaurant itself was all covered up so no light from the inside would bleed out. So, I thought it was closed! My family and I kicked my brother out of the car to check if it was open, and when he opened the door and light bled out of the restaurant, we knew it was open. After being seated by kind employees, I ordered a Pho Tai.  Pho should always be judged on three things-- broth, noodles, meat. Broth was 5/5, meat was 4/5 because there weren't enough meat with the noodle ratio (I had like a solid 6 piece of pho Tai mean pieces) but the tenderness of the meat was nice. The only small issue I had with the noodles was that it was slightly harder than other pho noodles I've encountered. Portion is HUGE. Thus, 4/5.   The service was really, really good. Everyone was nice and polite.",

Food here isn't bad by any means.. it just missed the mark by a little bit for everything.  Pho Dac Biet comes in one size- large. I can't eat a large, and I've never been to a legit Vietnamese place that doesn't give you the option. Pho Dac Biet also does not have tripe in it, and their actual pho menu is quite small.  Speaking of me being salty already, the broth was so salty that I couldn't convince myself to continue eating my pho since it was borderline unenjoyable. I told the older gentleman working, and like all great chefs, he didn't seem very appreciative of my criticism. If you are trapped in the same situation, make sure you ask for a side of hot water to go with it.  Fried egg rolls were good but nothing spectacular. Their filling includes a lot of vegetable, and I like meat and Asian mushroom fillings for my Vietnamese egg rolls.  Bonus points: $4 for a whole coconut. That was my favorite part.

Of course, we drove :)  They were out of the oxtail pho that day which was a super bummer because that's what the boo wanted. He got the rare steak with brisket instead and loved it. I ordered the veggie pho and LOVED it as well. It's hard to find veggie-based broth's that are super flavorful and this place did it right. YUMMY! We also ordered the tofu spring rolls which were just OK. We're both not a fan of tofu so that's why. Also, the peanut sauce it comes with contains chicken so vegetarians be VERY careful!!  Service for a pho joint was out of this world! The server came to check on us a few times and was extremely patient when taking our order.   10/10 would come back here again and again :) I think we found our new pho spot in Vegas!",

I've been there multiple times but after finding this place, I found my new Pho place to go to!  This hole in the wall seems much more authentic than Pho-Kim Long in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, the outside of this place does seem a bit sketch and it is located off the strip but the dishes I've tried so far has exceeded my expectations. I tried this place twice and I enjoyed much more than Pho-king. Probably come here from now on~  They have their own lot so parking is not an issue!  However, there is one particular lady who does have a bit of attitude. Oh well.. I just ignore it.",

    "text": "My girlfriend was craving asian while vacationing vegas so decided on pho.  Just searched on Yelp for pho and Pho Bosa was the first in the list so picked here....  Service very good.  A mixture of Viet and black staff.  The americans were conscientious and served with a happy attitude.  Mind you, Asian restaurants--esp. Viet and Chinese--are not known for exceptional service....  I'm not a pho expert and have trouble differentiating between good and bad pho...  Is it the noodles?  Clear or murky broth better?  As long as you pass the taste test, your pho is fine with me!  Passed!  Portion was definitely good for a large bowl.  What deserves mention are their summer rolls.  I think they add a column of spring roll wrapper in the summer roll.  This added a crunchy texture that won me over.  I gladly helped my gf finish her share when she got full!  Here is a pic of their summer roll... the crunchy goodness comes from the column on the left... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-bosa-las-vegas?select=pDC37VraokbrQZGObeRIWg#U03LDP_MSFhgyH2h0h1s7A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-...</a>.  Good pho, great service.  Summer rolls are a must!  I'm a fan!",

These rolls are amazing. Even with a pork patty/sausage and fried wonton inside the roll, it still has the refreshing quality of light summer rolls because of the fresh vegetables. Great stuff.  #36 Cha Gio, Bi Cha, Suon Nuong ($10.99): Egg Rolls, Shredded Pork Loin, Egg Quiche, and Grilled Pork Chop. I'm a big fan of broken rice dishes because I love Jasmine rice and I dislike vermicelli noodles. I love Vietnamese grilled pork chop and this one was great. Also, yummy egg rolls. I didn't love the shredded pork or egg quiche though. The rice itself was fine, but not the best one I've had in town.  I would come here just for the Nem Nuong Cuon and other rolls, but otherwise, it's not particularly special. Lots of noodle soup options for those of you that like Pho, etc!",

Place was pretty simple, we wanted to eat fresh spring rolls which you can find at any Vietnamese restaurant but they didn't have those, they had their own version of a spring roll which was OK, but there's no reason why they can't offer regular spring rolls. Anyways, we ordered pho and it arrived after about 10-15 minutes, and honesty, it was just OK. After reading the reviews, we expected much better. I've had better pho in Boston, Orlando and New York.  Our server was kind, but we won't be back.",

I'm originally from northern Virginia, where they know how to do it right.  So, this place has a lot of learning to do when it comes to vietnamese spices.  The bun bo hue lacked so much flavor- it tasted like salted brown water with red coloring floating on top.  The blood cake tasted not right.  I asked the server why it was sooo bland and he said there's separate seasoning they add when they serve it, like in the vietnamese region of hue. Well heck, I ordered bun bo hue, not watered down whatever it is you served me.  My husband had a rice dish with egg rolls, shrimp cake and nem. He said the shrimp cake was good but the nem (pork sausage) had zero flavor.  We live in Hawaii and were hoping for some great VN food in LV but this place was disappointing.  We always want to support local hole in wall eateries.  Work on your spices and seasonings, Pho Bosa.  We might try you again next time, but probably not.",

Seriously, how long does it take for the cook to make 5 bowls of pho??? The worse part was that the waiter didn't even try to come by and let us know that they're way behind. Unacceptable! I will tell all of my friends and other family member not to come to this place. We went to Kim Long and the wait were well worth it!",

Based on the pics, the rolls looked amazing.    I had really high hopes for this restaurant. The service was great. However, one bite into the roll and I tasted something so nasty and bitter. Awful. Then as I dissected the roll, that bitterness was the cucumber. The skin of the cucumber to be exact.   What was confusing was - I ordered the vermicelli, which also had the cucumber but I didn't taste the bitterness of it. If anyone here knows a place that has the best Nem Nuong rolls, holler!",

    "text": "Bun rieu is life after a long night out. The bun rieu here is to die for. Their soup base is so flavorful and their crab meatballs were amazing. They were so generous with their crab meatballs and there was way more crab/shrimp than there was meat, which for me personally, is what I'm looking for in a great bun rieu - quality ingredients. The noodles they put in the bun rieu were a bit too hard for my liking. They were almost crunchy? I think if they were just cooked a bit longer they would have been fine.   I can't really speak for anything else here besides the bun rieu. My friends got different varieties of pho, and they all said it was ok. My vietnamese friend said that the broth for the regular phos were weak/lacking depth of flavor, but then again he said that he was spoiled by the pho his parents spent hours making at home. The one thing we all agreed on though was that that was the longest we've ever waited for an order of pho to come out. We came in around 12 for lunch and ordered by 12:10pm. Our pho and spring rolls did not come out for almost 35-40 minutes. But, if I'm ever back in Vegas, I'll be sure to come back here after a long night out for a good bowl of bun rieu.   Cons: - Long wait for food so be prepared if you're starving - Pho broths were lacking depth of flavor - Noodles were a little under cooked  Pros:  - Service was great - Bun rieu here is amazing!!  - Relatively easy to find parking  - Quite little area off the strip away from the hustle and bustle - Great hangover cure for anyone who needs one",

    "text": "So GOOD Pho You.  At the behest and strong recommendation of a fellow foodie/yelper, we made time during a recent Vegas trip to try out more places off the strip.  Thankfully, Pho Bosa ended up on our list as the visit and meal was truly memorable.  LOCATION:  In a fairly nondescript shopping complex not too far from the strip.  Since it was SOCLOSE, we decided to venture to the restaurant without the aide of a navigation app or device.  Long story of a short drive:  We arrived without incident at our destination 10 minutes prior to opening.  SETTING/AMBIANCE:  The restaurant is quite cozy, and has a very home-like feel to it.  Very casual.  A mix of tables and booths make up the seating area.  FOOD:  Since it was my first time, I chose to let my friend take the lead in ordering.  And speaking the of food, the menu is massive.  Many selections of drinks, appetizers, food combos (chicken, pork, sausage, etc.), and pho.  We shared the springs rolls and we each ordered the Bun Bo Hue pho.    The pork sausage spring rolls were quite good and were the perfect start to our meal.  As for the pho, though the Bun Bo Hue is served spicy, I admit I was a coward and requested a mild broth. And sans the infused pork blood as well.  I wasn't sure how my stomach would handle such a thing.  The entire bowl seemed massive to me when the server dropped it off the food at our table.  But, I saw, I ate, and I conquered my pho.  The rice noodles, beef shank, pork, onions, herbs, and lime in the lemongrass beef broth was simply delicious.  SERVICE:  Decent service.  Not bad but not fantastic.  The server checked on us throughout the meal and readily provided water refills.  CAFFEINE:  This was also my first time trying Vietnamese coffee.  All I can say is that I was WIDE AWAKE after the meal.    BOTTOM LINE:  It was pretty good, and I'm sure it will be good pho others too.  I shall return!",

The broth was too sweet for my liking for both noodle soups.

We walked in there and it wasn't busy so they said to pick a table.  No one came to take our drink orders.  It was 10 minutes before we asked if we can order drinks.  The servers where nice.  One of our friends that ate with us was her first time trying Pho.  Whatever she had ordered she enjoyed.  Another friend ordered the sausage roll and I think she liked it. She ate it all.  I ordered their Oxtail Pho and one egg roll.  I enjoyed it. Flavor of the broth was just right for my liking and not salty.  The reviews I read about this soup was the reason I tried it and they were spot on.  I had several tender pieces of oxtail in my soup and it was good.  I was going to take half of my soup home but it was so good that I just kept eating it all up.  The one egg roll I tried was just okay for me.  Some places give you all the trimmings with the pork egg roll and I thought I get a small something of trimmings but no, just one egg roll.    I didn't get to try it but this place also serves boba and Vietnamese sandwiches.  I did read prior to coming that you can't split payment on multiple cards so I would recommend prior to ringing up the bill if they could just split the checks.  Or if it's going to be on one bill per table and least have the name of the items listed on the receipt next to the price so the customers aren't guessing what price their orders were.   So with that being said, Happy Eatings until next time!",

So far I've tried their pho, bun bo Hue (spicy Hue style beef noodle soup), rice plates, vermicelli bowl, bun rieu (seafood tomato noodle soup) and nem cuon (spring/summer rolls). Everything is very delicious, not to mention their amazingly fresh sugarcane juice. I have been coming here for a long time now and have introduced so many of my friends and family to this place. I strongly recommend this restaurant if you're looking to try some authentic and delicious Vietnamese food. While you're there, do not forget to try the sugarcane juice if you haven't had it before. It'll change your life. :)",

They only have 1 size which is a large so I hope you come in hungry.  The second time, I ordered the broken rice dish with short ribs, egg cake, shredded pork and egg rolls. The rice was super fluffy and the ribs were tender so I would definitely recommend this dish. I also liked how the fish sauce bottle and chili were on the table so you can add as much sauce you want.  My party ordered the bun rieu and bun bo hue as well. They definitely picked the bun rieu over the bun bo hue. The bun rieu had a pretty solid broth and the flavors were all there. The bun bo hue soup was kind of lacking in the broth which is a little disappointment.   Service was great as well, the servers were attentive and the food came out pretty quickly.",

My favorite is their oxtail pho and nem nuong. The rice platters the serve are also extremely delicious. My favorite drink they offer is their cococane which is coconut juice and sugarcane juice combined together. It's the absolute best especially in the Vegas heat - very refreshing. If you like coffee, they also make amazing cafe sua da. Not to strong, sweet or creamy but just right. All the servers are very attentive and friendly as well especially to families! They only downside is the interior. The tables feel sticky, not because they're dirty, but because of the material. It would be nice if they got new furniture or revamped the inside.   If you're in Vegas give this place a try!",

We actually came here two days in a row this past weekend. They're literally always busy so if you can, come a little earlier before the lunch rush.  I really like their pho broth and their bun bo hue is also really good. I used to think that it would be hard to find legit Vietnamese food out in Vegas but this place is definitely authentic. Sometimes the service is a little slow because they're so busy but I have never had to ask twice for anything and the servers always come around to fill up our waters and ask if we need anything else.   If you need a quick cure to your hangover, look no further than Pho Bosa!",

Today we tried the oxtail pho, omg it's amazing. The broth is Smokey and the meat is tender. They also give a generous amount of meat in your bowl. Worth it!   We ordered our son the broken rice and Chinese sausage. I didn't know broken rice was a thing haha I'm really amazed by this dish. It comes with an egg, green onions on top and a side of shredded daikon and carrots. There is something that they do with the Chinese sausage the glaze on top makes you keep grabbing for more bites. My son is a picky picky picky very picky eater and he tore it up. Luckily he didn't finish it and we can take it home for left overs! (Btw, came back 3 more times for this dish. Addicting.)    Wife loves the pork spring rolls, I didn't want to ask for a bite because she was enjoying them so much :) she's also a picky eater so it must be good.   They also have this drink 'cococane' coconut and sugar cane mix. So refreshing! This is a must try.   Definitely will come back for more, and I will refer this place to my family, friends and co workers.",

We don't order the same food and the prices are also different so it makes difficult for us to pay on one check. I try to explain to the manager but he said it is their policy. We decided to go to pho Kinh Do instead. We glad that we made this decision to try out the noodles atpho Kinh Do. Super friendly service and their pho also so gooood.

The oxtails were so tender and delicious. The soup itself had a nice smokey flavor to it. Those 2 definitely made the dish. You get your money's worth too! The bowls were huge and their prices were about $1 or so lower than the pho places you would find on Spring Mtn. We also got the fried egg rolls and you actually get 5 rolls instead of the typical 4 which is a plus for me! The only downside is that it's far from where I live :( Or maybe that's a good thing?

The menu is hard to understand, reading for the first time we noticed four of the \"same\" sliced beef plate and thought it was misprinted. but the waiter was happy to explain how the non-pho plates work. Basically there are some five \"combo\" plates and under each combo has a large list of meats you can change accordingly.   I absolutely love the fried egg rolls that come with lettuce and what looks like a carrot slaw, makes for delicious lettuce wraps  Pho broth was superb, much better than anything I can get back home. but what really stood out was the noodle plate, my tastebuds exploded with flavors of barbecue char and whatever else the meats are seasoned with. I frequent Vietnamese restaurants a lot back home and never has the flavor been so pronounced and mouth watering.   Unfortunately for me, this restaurant set the bar so high I'm afraid that I'l be stuck with subpar food when I go home.",

    "text": "Really delicious and no frills Vietnamese food. It's a couple streets over out of the bustling Spring Mountain Road, but well worth you coming here.  I ordered the fried pork egg rolls, which came with plenty of lettuce, cilantro and herbs to wrap it in. Each table also has its own bottles of fish sauce (2 kinds) so you may dip to your heart's' content. The egg rolls have great flavor and not too greasy, filled with pork, mushrooms, and vermicelli.   The pho broth is a bit mild but the brisket has awesome flavor. It's smoked beforehand so there is a deep smoke flavor in each bite. The restaurant also has their own hot sauce they made. I prefer it over the typical Sriracha sauce. It's more tangy and packs more heat.  Overall a delicious and cheap place to grab a quick bite of Vietnamese. Can't wait to come back and try their broken rice dishes.",

In a rather small room-type restaurant, not far from the infamous Strip, Pho Bosa it's somehow part wizard-part mom food server! Just yesterday I had a nice portion of Ga Nuong(Grilled chicken), along with some egg rolls, rice and vermicelli noodles.Amazing food, you can clearly differentiate the strong flavors, the portion are very big and the staff is very polite and helpful.The inside decor it's quite raw, but as I realized, many of their customers are coming for the Pho, the perfect remedy for hangovers after a long drinking night, so the surrounding won't be a problem.What I don't like is that the drinks are coming in transparent plastic cups instead of real glass ones, but this minor issue won't make me give them less than 5 stars. Just remember, you're not going there for a J.Robuchon or Ramsay experience, you're going in there for a 20-30 minutes fulfilling, tasty meal .Just love to see this kind of small businesses around! Thank you guys!",

I can honestly say that I've had one of the best bowls of pho at Pho Bosa. The only other place which is in the same league as Pho Bosa is Pho So in Richmond VA. The soup, noodles, thin slices of eye of round steak, vegetables, everything was top-notch.   Don't worry about the sketchy location. The food is excellent.",

Whatever though, it took me forever to find this place and I'm not going to go searching around for a better place when I'm on vacation and don't know where I'm going. Oh well, at least the bowls have a hearty amount of noodles and meat. Still not happy about the price",

    "text": "While Pho Bosa's pho was everything everyone else described here on Yelp (delicious, flavorful, clean broth), what I'm really a fan of was their Pork Sausage Spring Rolls.   About $5 gets you two springs rolls with seemingly the perfect ratio of the pork sausage, greens, and the rest of the filling inside.  Each bite had a nice crisp crunch to it followed by the savoriness of the pork.  I would get this again and again.    The pho was fine, albeit, there was a desire for more.  I did not notice 'more meat' than other places as some reviews have claimed.  The slices of rare steak  that came in my particular bowl of pho actually over cooked itself by the time it was placed in front of me.  Still not a bad bowl of pho.  The actual restaurant is quite small with only a few tables so I can see it being busy and packed on a weekend.  We arrived early for lunch on a weekday and there was only 2 other customers there.  Sweet!  The service was fine and we never really had to worry about our waters being refilled or flagging the server for the check.  I'd recommend this establishment over Pho Kim Long 10 out of 10 times (because my friends think that iss the best place for pho) and be sure to grab those pork sausage spring rolls!",

If anyone knows what I mean lemme get a HOLLAAAAAAAA~  We came on the last day of my friend's wedding celebrations a couple weeks ago. There were a total of 8 of us and we were totally accommodated right when we got there (around 11am). The staff instantly gave us water and offered us more drinks (which I ALWAYYSSS love). I took advantage of some fresh coconut and some of the others got che ba mau (a 3 bean dessert drink) and some other stuff. THE COCONUT WAS SERVED OUT OF AN ACTUAL YOUNG COCONUT xoxoxoxo  As he was grabbing drinks, the staff also started to ask if we were ready for food. Most of us were starviiiiing, so we ordered right away! I was able to grab the bun bo hue (similar to pho but spicy and with pork's blood) which I think was a solid dish. I've had it multiple times, and have seen it go wrong with the noodles too soggy or the broth too spicy, etc. This one, however was great. Perfectly done noodles and delicious soup and pork's blood.   Great find!! Come here if you feel all GOOOOOOOPY from the night before's activities!",

And it's the little things that make this our new go-to spot for Vietnamese food: - Each table has its own fish sauce so you can serve yourself as much as you want. - They provide you with small scissors to cut your veggies or rolls as you wish. - Friendly service with a smile and pride in their food.  Full of Vietnamese people so you know they're doing something right. Wash it down with some excellent Thai iced tea and I'm in heaven.

We got a #74 pho tai, a #76 bun bo hue and a side of grilled pork. The tea here tastes much better than the other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Their noodle soup bowls here are huuuuge. Just like any other place, you get a plate of bean sprouts, lime wedges, basil and jalapeno  Pho Tai: Rice noodle (vermicelli) soup with rare steak. I like to put Hoisin sauce, 2 slices of jalapeno and juice from a lime wedge on my pho. The broth was tasty and LOTS of meat. I love it! 5/5  Bun Bo Hue: Spicy beef noodle soup with beef shank, cubes of cooked pork blood with ginger, pork, lemon grass broth. Think Tom Yum soup from a Thai restaurant but way spicier.  I've had this many years ago but the pork blood and spiciness of this soup scared the heck out of me. Their version tastes better and \"cleaner\" although I'm still scared of pork blood. This is actually a very good soup. My friend loves spicy food and even he thinks this was real spicy. 5/5  I can't complain about the service. The servers were very attentive and they're always asking \"you guy do ok?\" OK! Just make sure you call first before coming here, we were supposed to be here a few days before but for some reason, they were closed even if they were supposed to be open according to the days/hours outside the door and on their Yelp page.",

After a few spoonfuls I was regretting not choosing to go to a ramen place instead. A pretty bad situation, considering I was actually in the mood for pho when I got here, and their pho convinced me otherwise. And there I was sitting in front of a big bowl of boring pho.  I have to note that the bathroom is in an outside hallway of the adjoining strip mall / office complex. Weird and probably not the safest scenario at night, considering the low-rent industrial area this restaurant is in, just near West of the Las Vegas strip. Think Commercial Center (on Sahara) where Lotus of Siam is, and then imagine having to go outside to use the bathroom. Weird, right?  Broth = meh. Location = ick. Unlikely I'll be back.  But lots of people seem to love it!",

    "text": "Visit:  late afternoon, Saturday, Oct. 31, 2015   Although located off of the always bustling Spring Mountain Rd., Pho Bosa is on the cusp of what is deemed as China Town, in a section that feels more industrial than most typical restaurant goers might be accustomed to when looking for a place to dine -- but don't let that stop you from venturing into this little hole-in-the wall gem!  Inside is small and utilitarian; with just a handful of booths and a few tables -- each table having a variety of sauces to spice things up.  The wait staff is prompt, friendly, and also quite helpful.   * Important Note:  The men's and women's restrooms are located outside of the establishment itself, in a hallway immediately outside of the back exit. -- I admit, at night it can be a bit spooky. So, if you're a big wuss like me...have a friend tag along!   My friend and I both ordered vermicelli bowls -- one a combination of grilled pork, shrimp cake, fried rolls, and a side order of grilled shrimp -- the other bowl had chicken and short ribs.  And for starters, an order of Fresh Spring Rolls.  In all fairness and truth, let me just say, I've never met a vermicelli bowl that I didn't like! :)   And, Pho Bosa did not disappoint! The bowls are large, the salad crisp, and all of the meats were flavorful and grilled to perfection.  Also, the shrimp cake is quite fantastic -- beautiful color, taste, and texture; a nice add-on to any meal.  Spring Rolls: They're okay. I can't say that they're particularly special, they don't have much going on in terms of flavor -- but I will say that I do enjoy the crunchy texture that the fried wrapper adds.   I'll Be Back!!! :)",

I inquired about the eggrolls and the waiter told me it is $1 extra for each. He failed to tell me it is a dollar extra on top of their $1.25 listed price. So my soup cost $9 and 2 small eggrolls cost me $4.50.... half of my main entree. What a ripoff.  Not sure if I'll come back to try other entrees. The appetizers are just too way over priced.  For the idiot that sent me a so called \"compliment' about eggrolls being a $1 extra that is exactly what it means... not $1 extra on top of the $1.25 on the menu. The waiter needs to clarify. If you go buy a burger and the employee ask you if you would like fries for a $1 extra you don't expect it to be $2.25....  If that doesn't make sense to you then oh well...",

It was, as I was told, supposedly much more authentic and tastier than what I am used to from my local Pho place.   So we got Bo Bun Hue, Nem Nuong Cuon and the Korean ribs combo that came with broken rice and egg rolls. I didn't really try the Bo Bun Hue. It was supposedly mad spicy. Stayed away from it. I had the Korean ribs which I thought were a bit mediocre and the egg rolls wasn't anything I would rave about.   Why the four stars then? I loved loved loved loved loved their Nem Nuong Cuon. It's basically a spring roll with Vietnamese prom sausage. It was soooooo good. I can eat this all day errrday. The dipping peanut(?) complimented the roll very well. A definite must try. I wonder why we do not have this in the east coast :(  The place has a homey feeling. I was watching the Asian mother-son across us. The boy was getting a lecture from mom about school. Ahhhhhh just like home.",

Typical fixins' but the overall dish seemed to be missing some dimension. They used a ton of rare steak which was a plus and the noodles were filling. The most surprising part was that it costs almost exactly the same price as most other places in the states. I expected the price to be a bit inflated due to location but not here. The staff were so nice and friendly. I'd describe them as funny as well. It was a great experience overall and I'd come back to try something different just based on that.

    "text": "I'm not a Las Vegas local but if I was, I would not be returning to Pho Bosa. On my way into town we stopped in for two bowls of veggie pho. The service was great, the restaurant is large and mostly empty at the time we went in. However, the vegan veggie pho that all the other yelpers are giving such great reviews on was not very good. The broth was very salty and oily, and to my husband and I, it tasted like chicken broth. The vegetables in the soup were not the freshest, we had brown spots on the carrots, black spots on the bok choy and the mushrooms had an awful texture. There were 5 pieces of tofu in my soup, and after eating one I left the others in the bowl. Also the noodles were all clumped together and even though we let them sit in the hot broth for over ten minutes, they just got more gluey.  We paid and left without finishing our bowls.  The plus side was they brought out a huge plate of bean sprouts with lots of basil, and also gave us forks and napkins without us having to ask.  Next time though, I'll pass on this one.",

    "text": "Wow. Definitely a hidden gem off the strip in Vegas! My friends and I woke up Sunday morning craving some Pho. We figured that all the Pho restaurants on the Strip were going to be pretty expensive and not that great, so we ventured off the strip to Chinatown.   The pho at this restaurant is so cheap, big portions, and super authentic. My friend and I shared a large pho with rare steak and beef balls. I wasn't super hungry so it was just the right size for both of us. The broth was super good and not too oily. I also really liked the beef balls and thought that they had really good flavor. The rare steak was okay, but I don't really order that normally anyway.   They also had a bunch of flavored teas that looked really good - passionfruit mango with chia seeds, etc. The yelp deal is only good for weekdays so if you come on the weekends it will be regular price! My friend got the number 9 - the flavor was good but a bit too sweet for me.   (P.S. This place is perfect for curing a hangover the next day)",

Food: decent, close to authentic Vietnamese compared to where I came from(Maryland). It isn't the BEST but it is almost there. The pho broth has flavor, the nem nuong was decent, the sauce for the nem nuong was good (taste homemade). The com tam were good as well, had most of the components.  Service: was okay, it could be better. I work at a restaurant and I always expect more out of servers.   The only thing I don't like is the service charge being on the check. It makes me want to tip less.",

In terms of comparison to the LV region, I'd say their pho is a solid 4 stars. It's hard to find good pho in Vegas and this is definitely not bad. I had pho tai gau and personally didn't like how they grilled/barbecued the brisket. The smokey flavor from the brisket ruined the pho for me.   Now if I compare it to places I've been growing up, of course this does not compare one bit. The broth was too sweet (too much MSG) but hey, some people might like that.  Service was usual. I generally don't expect too much from pho restaurants in terms of service.",

We walked in and was greeted immediately by a gentleman, smiling and showing us to our seats. He brought out the menu and asked for our drink orders right way. He recommended the Vietnamese iced Coffee but we passed on it.   The pho broth is probably the better if not the best in the Las Vegas area but then again, I've only had pho at 4 other places in LV. Plenty of meat and veggies. I didn't have to use a lot of condiments.   Our waitor gave us a sample of the iced coffee and my, my, it IS the best Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had. I ordered one for my Mom and I. She said it was too bitter but changed her mind later after she mixed it and it got a bit watered down.  Spring rolls were on point. The dumplings were amazing. They only had another couple in the establishment so we only waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. Our waitor was attentive and super friendly. There were plenty of seating and they were playing \"Kung Fu Panda\", awesome!   One regret was I should have ordered a second iced coffee. It was well balanced of sweet and bitter. It kept me up. My parents and husband agree this will be our go to Pho Restaurant when we come to Vegas.",

None of us could finish our bowls. They also offer a variety of drinks--I liked the coconut and sugarcane juice. They also have fresh coconuts, if you're into that. No frills but good food.",

Bun Rieu is okay but my sister likes it here. I don't like it because it is too watery and too much eggs. I want real crabs. Bun Rieu is supposed to be a Vietnamese ciopinni. It supposed to have real seafoods and not eggs!!!! It is supposed to be red like ciopinni. That's what is it!!! Whatever. I also like the pennywort (gotu kola) drink with bean. It tastes like they are extraction from the leaves in lieu of imitation.    People are finding the place. It gets really busied during rush hours so we are avoiding it by coming early.

From their Thai Tea, Spring Rolls, to all of their Pho options. The servers will educate you on what to put in your choice of Pho and which seasonings will enhance specific tastes. I have been here when it's super slow to super busy and you usually get seated right away. What is nice is that there is a bar right next door so this could be a date spot.

Forgive me for not having proper combo names; Pork Summer Rolls: really good, fresh tasting. The veggies were crumchy and the sausage was flavorful. The peanut sauce was a nice touch as well. Not a thick thai-satay style sauce, but thin with a touch of vinegar.  Grilled Chicken platter with shrimp cake and egg roll: AMAZING. Can chicken really taste this good? I wasn't sure that I'd like the shrimp cake at first, but the taste was amazing- not at all mushy like I had expected. The egg roll left much to be desired, but I overlooked that. Combination Pho: Brisket, raw thin sliced beef, tendon, and beef balls. The soup was really nice and light- perfect if you like your soup plain or gives you plenty of room for \"improvement\" if you like mixing your soup to taste.   The service was what really put this place over the top. Our server, I regret not to have asked his name, not only helped me choose every aspect of my meal but also helped to mix the sauce that went over the dish and give me tips on how I'm supposed to eat it. Really nice guy.",

    "text": "The food was ok. I decided to try a different place based on Yelp reviews. We usually frequent Pho Kinh Do or even Pho Kim Long.  Our order: Pho Dac Biet, Bun Bo Hue and Com Tam Tau Hu Ky Bo Nuong.   The pho soup base was diluted. The beef in the Bun Bo Hue were such huge chunky pieces. Some were tender and others were tough. The broth is not bad. For a large bowl I got two itty bitty cubes of pork's blood. My husband said the rice place wasn't good and I believe him because he didn't finish it. He said the baked egg tasted rubbery and the slices of beef were more like teriyaki than having that grilled flavor. The tau hu ky was not bad...crispy.   Note: All noodle soups are large only.  Small place, decent service. It's almost right off the 15 when you exit...away from the center if Chinatown.",

Thank you pho bosa for sending my taste buds on such a magnificent journey.",

    "text": "Despite being located in a somewhat shady looking strip plaza in Chinatown, Pho Bosa is definitely a solid option for pho if you happen to be in the area. It's not that far off the Strip and is just like a 10 min taxi ride. It's not a huge establishment, so be prepared to wait for a bit. The pho is not standout good, but is still good enough, and the soup is flavourful without being too salty. They have hands down the best Vietnamese coffee I've ever had though - rich in flavour, not overly sweet with too much condensed milk, and not a scarily vibrant shade of orange. Fantastic. We also grabbed a vermicelli and rice dish to go, and both were great and flavourful and came loaded with lots of pork, spring rolls, etc. There was a guy working there at the front (the owner?) who was super cool and friendly, easy to talk to, and he was nice about letting us just loiter around inside while we waited ages for our taxi to come. Definitely worth checking out, I'll probably be back next time I visit Vegas!",

The spicy beef was awesome as it was last time.  The beef is so tender and flavorful it is amazing. My friend had the vegetarian and was very pleased with the outcome.  The place was slammed and they still took time to talk to us.   I just went to the new location located in a strip mall on Valley View.  They seat a lot more now.  I had the spicy beef Pho and it was scrumptious and the fried pork rolls were awesome, especially after the chef showed me how to wrap them with lettuce, noodles and condiments.  This place is destined to be a local hit.",

However, after 7 years of living in Vegas, I have to say the Bun Bo Hue is so far one of the best I've had in town.  SGV good? No... But definitely something I would come back for in Las Vegas.  $8.99 for a bowl of pho is actually quite hefty.. But considering the location being so close to the strip (usually higher price point) and the ingredients (lots of tender meat) it's acceptable.",

I arrived in the parking lot of the little strip mall where the restaurant is located within 5 minutes.   As soon as I entered I was greeted by a man with a warm smile. The man, who was extremely friendly, had my pho waiting for me with all the fixings (including hoisin sauce and sriracha).   After driving 20 minutes home, I opened my bag to find my pho steaming hot. I had the number 73 which is beef noodles with rare steak. From the minute I had my first bite, I knew I'd be a regular! This pho was SO FRESH and TASTY! I've had a lot of pho in my life, and I can say that this is at the top of my \"best of\" list.  I would highly recommend this place if you're near the strip and looking for a delicious and filling meal. I'm already plotting my next visit.....",

It will come fried if you add tofu so request steamed if that's what you want. So delicious. Our server, Moses, was a delightful man (I would hire him in a minute), and everyone else who stopped by our table was genuinely friendly. Absolutely generous portions of veggies (in fact, I'm going to say it- the best I've had yet). We also had veggie Spring Rolls that came with a different sauce but it was terrific. Apparently they are also re-doing the menu and adding even more vegetarian options. The only thing we felt was a little strange was the decor, and that cleaning supplies were out. The decor was awkward with signs promoting health products that had nothing to do with food. That said, just ignore it. I've been to Asia and had my best meals sitting on sticky children's school stools in back alleys. Think Diner's Drive-ins and Dives! I AM a designer so it made me a little berserk, I wanted to Re-do everything because the food is so damn good I don't want people to dismiss it or leave less than 5 stars because of atmosphere. It was super clean and delicious. If you want great Pho in Vegas, this place should be top on your list. If you're a vegetarian, it's the only one we have found where they totally got it that we didn't want veggies in beef broth.",

The soup came out super hot and spicy, and I think my favorite part about this dish was the pork blood. It was flavored somehow where when you bit into it, you could taste the spices as well. The portion was huge, where I unfortunately couldn't finish it, but was a decent price for what they give you. Their nem nuong was also really really good, almost comparable to that of Brodards (in Southern California).   BUT you could also disregard this review since I wasn't really \"there\", but I will be back very VERY soon to have it again.",

It means that it was mixed with lot of fish paste. It lacked the firmness of real shrimp cake (see photos). There was almost no meat in the meat loaf (see photo). There was no \"thinh\" in the porkskin/shreddedpork. This is not acceptable. 2. Cleanlines - 1*. The 2 out of 3 servers worn disposable kitchen aprons. They also worked in the kitchen. The aprons were dirty and they kept wearing them (see photo).  3. Price is high - 1*. I ended up paying 24 dollars for side if meatbsll, 2 pieces of eggroll and a rice dish.  4. Pho broth was terrible. From the smell, it stinks of beef bones instead flavor full from the brisket. It means that they substitute meat for stinking bones.   They charged everything that is supposed to be free in an authentic Pho restaurant such as sliced onion or a small amount of extra soup.  I definitely won't come back.",

    "text": "I believe that pho is the best hangover food and after a late night of parting in Vegas, it is just what I needed. Pho Bosa was about a ten minute drive from The Strip and they had plenty of parking which was great. I visited the restaurant on Sunday at 12pm and it was packed! My group of four had to wait a few minutes for a table, which wasn't bad as we got to see and smell all the delicious food coming out of the kitchen. There were some larger groups who were waiting for what seemed to be ages. One downside to the interior of the restaurant us that I don't think they have central AC so it was pretty hot in the restaurant despite the fans they had blowing.  As an appetizer, we all shared the chicken spring rolls which I haven't seen on a lot of Vietnamese restaurant menus. I thought they were delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh. I thought the Pho Ga I ordered was some of the best I've ever had. The broth was well-seasoned and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The chicken was on the drier side but that's pretty standard for the dish. My boyfriend ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien and he said, \"It was good, but not great.\" He also tried the Suong Nuong platter that our friends ordered and he said the pork chop was amazing. When they ordered it, the waitress asked if they liked pork skin but her accent made it sound like, \"Do you like foreskin?\" It took a while to figure out what she meant but it gave us a laugh.  My favorite item on the menu was the fresh young coconut that they crack open and serve with a straw and spoon. It makes you never want to drink Zico or any other packaged coconut water ever again! If I'm ever in the Las Vegas area again I would make sure to visit Pho Bosa another time.",

They answer any and all questions that you have and if you don't get how their combo works, they'll be more than happy to explain everything. Seems to know their stuff, that's for sure.  I got #40 Thit Nuong (egg rolls, shredded pork loin, egg quiche, and grilled pork = it's a broken rice plate platter thing).  -- Egg quiche wasn't my thing but I really liked the egg rolls. Everything else was just eh. Nothing stood out here. I guess broken rice isn't my thing.   On my second visit, I tried their #71 Pho Dac Biet. I actually enjoyed the meat but as far as the noodles go.. bleh. I was just putting the hoisin sauce on it because it didn't taste good without it. The noodles were disappointing.

For a total of 5 visits they were closed for 3 of them with a sign on the door stating they've ran out of food. That is however the only negative thing I have to say about this place.   Bosa is definitely a hidden gem, has all the appearance qualities of a hole in the wall joint. The pho here is actually not great but all the rice dishes and other soup dishes are hands down the best in the area.   For starters the pork egg rolls are my go to, they're very similar to the famous broddards in LA with a little less crunch.   I typically order the bun bo hue and/or the pork/rice dish with Chinese sausage. The broth in the bun bo hue is extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spice and the thick noodles are cooked to a good texture. Also a small but important part of the experience that bosa does well is the quality of their side condiments like the cilantro and limes. They are very fresh and the limes aren't dried out like a lot of places.   Overall, the food here is done correct, they just need to stop closing in the middle of the day! Nevertheless, I'll be back to roll the dice again!",

After a long night of partying, a big bowl of pho sounded great for all of my hungover friends and I, but we definitely chose the wrong place to eat at. The pho broth had an off flavor, that's what ruined it for me. Even if there was superb meat (which there wasn't), broth is the main flavor component for pho so it was bad from the start. I mostly ate the meat drenched in sauce and left the rest.  One of the workers recommended the bun rieu to my friend; she said it was even better than the pho, but my friend thought otherwise. He said it was really salty and wasn't spicy whatsoever.   Oh and why is it named BOSA? Not Bolsa?!?!",

Place is very small as I stated earlier, not a great place for a large group and make sure you bring cash! Can't use card under 25$ purchase.  Pho was okay, noodles didn't taste that well, bun bo was decent. Cam tam (broken rice with pork) was bland, not really much flavor even with sauce on the side.",

Everything was a lot pricier than I expected. $8.99 for 5 egg rolls and $8.5 for what can only be considered a medium sized pho even tho they call it a \"large\". (No option for smaller sizes)  Everything was just okay.  My biggest complaint is the service. They gave us maybe 20 strings of carrot/dikon strings for the egg rolls and when I asked for more the lady was so condescending. Saying they have to charge us extra.... That's fine if I have this policy, but the attitude was uncalled for.  All in all, mediocre food, high pricing, and horrible service - would not recommend.",

I have had more than my share of frightening bowls of chewy mystery meats...  Don't let the location/building fool you.  It looks like the kind of place you might never work up the nerve to actually try, but inside it's nice and clean, and the food is fresh and really, really good.    Enjoy!  p.s.

This restaurant did not offer any brisket, which is strange. The server told me that they did not offer any pho with brisket but my friend next to me got a bowl full of brisket in her combo pho. Not that it matters considering the brisket was DRY AND UNCHEWABLE * no fish sauce was offered with the egg rolls we ordered. The server seemed annoyed when we asked for fish sauce and then continued to tell us that we had to make our own sweet/sour fish sauce. I have NEVER been to a Vietnamese restaurant where they didn't have fish sauce served with the egg rolls. In the end, it didn't matter because the spring rolls were not that great; however, they were better than the pho  *the next point is that the pho is very bland. We had to add a lot of lime and sauce for it to be somewhat good. We were so surprised because this place has such good reviews on yelp.   It's sad that this place has such bad food, along with bad service. We are Vietnamese and they talked to us as if we couldn't understand anything. We came here w/ a few drunk friends and they said the  food still was not appetizing, which is saying a lot. I highly DO NOT recommend this pho restaurant. Save your time and money and go elsewhere",

When we were escorted to our table, the chairs were all dirty so we had to ask them to clean them before we sat down. It took them a while to come over and clean the chairs before my parents and sister could sit down.   A local sitting nearby told us the pho wasn't great and that the best thing on the menu was the com tam (broken rice plates). I was feeling bun bo hue, but was told they were out for the holidays. (Highly disappointed because that was the only reason I chose this place!) My sister and I were reduced to ordering $8.50 bun rieu bowls and my hubby and parents ordered $10.99  com tam bowls. We waited 15 minutes for the bun rieu. The bun rieu was super bland, so I asked for shrimp paste. The owner totally ignored my request and we had to ask another waitress to bring it over for us. The com tam didn't appear until another 15 minutes after the bun rieu. However, the local was right. The com tam was pretty good. (Almost comparable with Com Tam Thanh in Santa Ana/Orange County, CA). However, the com tam was missing the bowl of soup that usually comes with this meal.   To conclude: service sucked, the price was expensive, and the food was not all that good especially for what you were forced to pay.",

    "text": "Although the Global popularity of Noodles in thin Broth suggests mass appeal the allure seems lost on many Midwesterners, a childhood of creamy concoctions such as Cream of Potato and various Chowders plus a general distaste for Lemongrass typically steering palates away from Vietnamese Food as a whole, though on Saturday evening these biases were set aside temporarily to taste Pho Bosa.  Located at 3711 South Valley View Boulevard on the corner of Twain, a low-slung room at the far end of a Strip-mall giving the space a decidedly informal feel, it was entering with three others including two regulars that staff smiled in recognition, a four-top in the main room quickly set and menus presented while the smell of Cilantro and Onions emanated from the Kitchen.  Oddly decorated in advertising for holistic medicine and stress relief, a second room near the toilets dark and unoccupied save for a woman who appeared to be doing bookkeeping on her laptop, it was after washing hands that decisions were made including three Soups, an Appetizer and Sandwich, the low total of $52 including tax and tip explaining a lot about why so many find Pho Bosa appealing.  Additionally offering Grilled Cheese, Paninis and Boba, the later described as \"super sweet\" by someone familiar, it was as others readied Condiments both liquid and solid that bowls and plates were delivered, first bites of sliced Spring Rolls finding the textures pleasant though taste lacked without housemade Peanut Sauce while a Thit Nuong Bahn Mi Sandwich lacked Pate in favor of BBQ Pork that tasted like the inside of Char Siu Bao with Mayonnaise added to offset partially dried Bread.  Edible but not wowing to this point, three gigantic bowls still waiting and placed in  smaller tasting vessels before other diners added Bean Sprouts, Hoisin or Hot Sauce, suffice it to say that Pho Ga with steaming Chicken Stock had nothing on Chicken Noodle Soup from Western Cultures in terms of complexity while Smoked Oxtail in smoky Broth fared better, though even this Chef's Special with plenty of Oil and tender Beef failed to match Bun Rieu that surprisingly featured a lot of Seafood surrounding thin Noodles while large Tomato chunks added bright spots of acidity to help counter the fatigue of spoonful after spoonful of identical flavors.   TWO AND A HALF STARS:  While certainly not Pho Bosa's target audience the fact remains that one can only do so much with cheap ingredients in Broth, and although better than prior experiences the fact that everyone else in the room was seen dressing up their Bowls indicates the product as served lacks in perceivable ways even to those who consider themselves fans.",

This place gets packed fast. As soon as you finish they try to clear your table asap, but didn't felt like they were rushing you out the door.   The only thing I see that can be improved was the attitude from one of their waitresses. Apparently, a group of three elderly people sat down at a table for big parties and she wanted that table back for a group of eight. She could have asked them in a more pleasant manner.",

It wasn't too busy, and we were seated and ordered pretty quickly. Once we stopped giggling at the posters advertising \"cococane\" juice, of course.  We all ordered the same thing: the combination pho. The meatballs and tendon were okay, but the brisket and steak tasted like liquid smoke, which was kind of off-putting. The smoke flavor leached into the broth, which wasn't great. The noodles were fine. The best part, though, was that the bowl was massive, and probably enough to feed two people. Good deal.  Service was fine. We were in and out pretty quickly, which was nice for us. Seems that the popular items here are the rice plates and sandwiches, which might explain why the pho wasn't all that great. Would consider returning when I am back in Vegas and wanting Vietnamese food.",

My daughter had the vegetable pho. I was very surprised at how flavorful the broth was. Other places I've been to it has tasted quite bland and usually requires a good bit of soy sauce. Not here. There was also a huge amount of veggies.  I absolutely LOVED the tofu spring rolls. I am usually not a fan of tofu but since my daughter vegetarian we opted for this instead of shrimp. I would have to say that this was the best spring roll I've had.  The price is very inexpensive and the portions are very large and can easily feed 2 people if not 3.",

The bowl is huge and I had plenty of broth leftover. This dish was super basic with nothing but noodles and your typical pho toppings of onions, cilantro, and beansprouts but was exactly what I needed. Of course you can stick with the regular pho orders with the meat, but I skipped out on it this time.  This is the perfect place for your next morning hangovers.

The Strip can be so overpriced, inaccessible, crowded and rowdy, I've always preferred transporting to a calmer location in the Las Vegas area during my vacations here. After a night of partying, the only thing that has timelessly relieved me of my day-prior drinking hangovers is pho.   In addition, I've had mediocre pho in San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego... but for some reason I've always found the pho in Las Vegas to impress me far beyond any other place I've visited.

But the servers promptly filled our water cups everytime they saw it half empty.    I ordered my bun bo hue and my mom got pho dac biet and nem nuong cuon to start.  The nem nuong cuon were a delight!  I have been looking for ones with the crunchy noodle.  It was perfectly balanced with crunch and freshness.  The bun bo hue and pho dac biet were seasoned perfectly.  It was unlike other pho joints, heavy on the meat instead of noodles. And the meat selection was of good quality and not overly fatty.

It's in a rundown plaza and the door is filled with grass or something, but once you find the entrance I guess you can say you made it to the finish line and that the grass may be greener on the other side. MIGHT. All I gotta say is food was alright. Just average actually. The pho just taste kinda boring like it was lacking flavors. Not to mention, that they don't really accommodate to people with small appetites. They only have one size and it's a large. The bowls are really not that large but it is a lot for people who only eat small bowls at a regular pho restaurant. Also, the presentation was just off for everything. Appetizers didn't look appetizing even tho they were not too bad. But still. The coffee was too sweet and didn't represent Vietnamese coffee too well. Lastly, service was great at the beginning but it kinda died at the end. It took FOREVER for our server to bring the bill.",

Prices for appetizers were bit expensive but pho prices were good.   The pho looked great and the broth was tasty. It passed the initial spoonful of soup before I add all my fixings. However, noodles weren't cooked enough and the meat had a weird taste.   Service was ok. Overall, my experience was okay. I've definitely had better. It was honestly a sort of let down. I got high standards because of Saigon Bistro in Concord!  Would I be back? I don't think so. I would like to try different pho spots when in Vegas.",

It's everything I wanted and more. 5 stars across the board in all aspects- efficiency, service, quantity, quality, and price. We came during EDC weekend and as you can imagine, it was constantly packed with bodies queued outside the door, heavily hungover and dying for that magical broth to save them. I don't know how they managed it (the store is on the smaller side) but our wait time was only about 20-25 minutes even with large groups ahead of us. We were seated promptly and our orders came out lightning fast. They don't sacrifice quality OR quantity because the portion is huge and delicious!!! And the prices are SO cheap, especially considering we were in Las Vegas. The banh mis were the best I've ever had and filled with so much meat for $6; we actually came back here 3 days in a row to stock up on it. My table also ordered pho thai ($8), bun bo hue ($8.50) and the \"snow\" smoothie with boba ($5). The broth was not overly salty and beef was plentiful. Boba was perfectly chewy and refreshing for the hot day. Every waiter was friendly and I cannot recommend this place enough. Will definitely come back here next year!",

The place is pretty hidden from the Main Street, prob won't know it's there if you are just driving by. We came in around 11 on Sunday, they had 4 tables already sat. We were seated immediately and all got different variation of broken rice.   Overall the food was pretty good. They bring out nice silverware compared to other Viet places where you get the cheap plastic ones. The portion was smaller than when they first opened but I was still stuffed. The tofu (tau hu ky) was good, very crispy and we got big pieces too. I also got cha which was ok, nothing impressive but also not the worst I have had. And got a fried egg on mine. Parents added meat to theirs and they said the meat had good flavors.   Service was good, very polite staff, water and tea came out quickly. And I liked that their tea was dark, stronger than other places, some places very you very light tea, like... just yellow water.   Some cons: -waited 30 minutes for our food  -they do not split checks - the table next to us wanted to split and the waitress simply said \"no\" lol -they auto-grat for our part of 5... not sure if it is because of CES but isn't it usually party of 6 or more?!? -they did not tell us that gratuity was included, the waitress gave us the iPad and told us to pick one of the options for the tips - if we hadn't looked at the physical check we would have tipped again.. a little shady",

    "text": "Pho Bosa's newer, larger & even better restaurant! Congrats on the new location!  Come here for authentic Vietnamese comfort food. Everything is fresh, made from scratch & most importantly made with love! There isn't anything that I don't like here; but if I have to give suggestions, here are my favorites:  I am obsessed with their Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab, tofu & tomato noodle soup) it tastes just like how my mom makes it at home. Hooked up with lots of goodies in a balanced savory broth! I refuse to eat this dish anywhere else (except home.) Noone else compares (except for momma.) Flavor rating: 5/5  You will not eat a better bowl of Bun Bo Hue  (Vietnamese style spicy beef noodle soup) anywhere else in Vegas. Trust me, I've tried several places and keep coming right back (multiple times a week.) It's as authentic as you'll taste at a restaurant. All of the meat in the Bun Bo Hue soup is super tender; they have lots of buttery brisket, huge chunks of flavorful ham hock, even the coagulated pig blood tastes flavorful and fresh (which I don't even typically like to eat, kind of freaks me out at times), and they also include very yummy pork roll sausage loaf too - just to name a few goodies. But that's just the tip of the iceberg; the rich broth is flavored with just the right amount of spiciness, saltiness, sweetness, definitely umami. Oh and the fresh lemongrass stalks infused into the broth just knocks it out of the park! You can really tell someone in the kitchen cares about their cuisine and tastes everything, multiple times. Flavor rating: 5/5  Other items that we can't get enough of are the Nem Nuong Cuon (pork patty spring rolls) - the dipping sauce is key and they have perfected it; it's slightly thick, perfectly sweet, extremely flavorful and addictive. Also the fried egg roll wrapper inside of the spring roll is always a nice surprise and adds such an incredible texture and crunch. You can certainly compare these spring rolls with the world famous Brodard in Orange Country, CA - they are on the same level. Flavor rating: 5/5  I also love their Com Tam (broken rice) dishes - we normally get the combo: Com Tam, Bi, Cha, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio (broken rice, shredded pork skin, pork egg quiche, grilled pork, and egg rolls) they also bring out some hot and comforting soup broth to sip with the rice dish. So good!!! We go to town on the plate as everything is so flavorful and freshly prepared. Its more than enough food for us to share, but we get greedy, so we always order something else (Bun Bo Hue) so we can have the best of both worlds. This is the best place that I've had Com Tam in Vegas so far and I've lived here for over half a year now and tried many places. Flavor rating: 5/5  What keeps us coming back - The food! Also the cook/owner Vanessa is so sweet and humble. We love complimenting her often on her food. She is originally from California (Orange County) so she knows what the food scene in \"Bolsa\"/Little Saigon tastes like and the fierce competition out there. She brings her love for food and \"A\" game to Vegas and we are so thankful she did!!  PRO TIP: I also love requesting for their spicy sate sauce and always add a spoonful into all of my food. It kicks everything up few notches in the heat and flavor department and I love a good kick in the pants.",

    "text": "We used to frequent Pho Bosa when we first moved to Las Vegas. It was close to where we were staying, it was absolutely delicious, and we got lots of food for a relatively low price. Also, Vanessa and Moe are very friendly and we love coming by to say hi to them. They were the first nice locals we met in Las Vegas.  I ate a lot of pho during the hottest months of the summer, which is another testament to how good the food is. If it's over a hundred degrees outside and I'm still ordering hot soup, it has to be pretty exceptional!  We live further away from Chinatown now and don't have Vietnamese food nearly as often, but once I tasted it here, I couldn't bring myself to go anywhere else. I really want to explore the menu and I have branched out from time to time, nothing has ever disappointed me.   What keeps me coming back is Vanessa's pho broth! I have never in my life tasted a more amazing pho broth. It is the perfect comfort food. When I am sick and craving my mom's food, I get some of their spicy pho and it always helps me feel better. I could drink a whole bowl of it with nothing added in, but it only gets better with more ingredients. They put a generous amount of meat and noodles and broth in there each time, I feel like they've got the ratio just right. I never feel like they skimp on anything.   I always get my pho with rare sliced beef, and with egg rolls in the fish sauce. The egg rolls are the perfect compliment to the savory broth. All the vegetables are fresh, and so is the meat. I'm really picky about the meat I eat, especially red meat, but I love all the different meats they serve here (I've had beef and pork).   The service is friendly, the food comes out to you reasonably fast, and I split my order with my boyfriend, but when we finish we are both full! I love this place and can't recommend it highly enough.",

My only complaints, which are very nit-picky and very minor, are that it would have been cool if the TV were on with a game or something.

Excellent place though, I'll be back for sure.",

We were three white people not familiar with Pho and our server went out of his way to really explain the purpose of all the flavors, the differences between Pho and the dish I ordered (Bun Bo Hue).  Plus, one of my friends was Vegetarian and one was allergic to seafood, so he went further out of his way to make sure all the ingredients fit with their situations.    Food: First I ordered the fried pork egg rolls.  They super delicious!  The server again mixed the sauces together for me (fish sauce & chili sauce) for dipping.  Then I realized half-way through eating the egg rolls was that I was eating them wrong.  I was eating them like a typical white person instead of realizing that the lettuce, herbs and veggies on the plate were meant to be used to wrap the egg rolls in.   At first we just thought it was really nice garnishes lol  Next I had the Bun Bo Hue.  One of the best broths I've ever tasted maybe ever.  I loved all the ingredients:  Brisket, Pork Sausage, Noodles, Cabbage and this Pork Blood thing.    I have a list of Pho places bookmarked on here, but it's going to be hard to want to try anywhere else.",

I was very happy with the broth but the meat was too tough. The evening was saved by my soda chanh muoi, which actually had great preserved citrus chunks in it, yum!  I have a feeling we're all referring to the same guy when we compliment the service, and he was indeed very friendly.

Pho Bosa boasts a pretty decent menu, I stuck with large (one size) Pho dac biet- the combo with meatballs, fatty brisket, flank, tripe and tendon usually. This version lacked the tripe but that's ok, everyone has their own way of making it. Broth was pretty good- not the best I have had but hit the spot for the craving we both had that day. It'll do the trick for hangovers, hints of a cold, late night food, and much more. It's a comfort food for many Asians and Americans so I know they'll do just fine with business being so close in proximity to the strip (you'll still need a car or taxi though). We also ordered the Nem Nuong (spring roll) which is another of my favorites. Brisk service and quick food-to-table. The only weird part was paying for our meal. They brought an ipad to the table to run the card and then straight up asked what we wanted to leave for tip. Very strange and kind of rude! I like the privacy of deciding myself and selecting it. Otherwise, it was a good solid meal and we enjoyed it a lot.",

    "text": "Im shocked at how many positive reviews this place has received. If I could give 0 stars, I really, really would, Before you decide to come here based of the good reviews this place has received take a moment to read this one. I've been to many pho places and I have never been more disappointed by pho than I was here. Since it is in Las Vegas, I didn't expect the pho to be extraordinary, but I also didn't think it would be a complete bust. Sadly, it was the latter. Save yourself some time and do not come here.   First off, the food itself. it takes \"10-20 minutes\" for your pho to come out ( I ordered #70 combination) according to a lengthy sign that gives a sad excuse for their slow service. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, believing that the time was lengthy to ensure quality. When the food arrived, I was horrified. The bowl looked plain and and somewhat incomplete. Here was the breakdown of what I got:   The broth - decent, hardly any flavor Noodles- tasted as though they just came out of an instant packet. They were not chewy and tasted stale.  Meat- unlike most places, Bosa gives you suspicious looking meat that tastes as though it has been sitting in the pot for a little too long. There also wasn't much meat either. Onions- you want more of it? Here's an extra $1 charge. No thank you.   Next complaint is the service. Our waitress came to our table with little professionalism and an irritated look on her face. She took 10 minutes to bring out our water and forgets the soda. One of my friends notices that the sriracha looked a little off color so she checks the bottle. It had expired in APRIL, and we were eating end of June. She took it to the front desk and the man merely apologizes and adds that all the sriracha comes from the same box. I'm baffled by this statement, as if it was supposed to make us feel any better. Not only was out sriracha expired, everyone else's in the restaurant was too. If this restaurant believes it is okay to be cutty about its regulations and attempt to serve customers expired sauce, your best bet is they they are doing some other shady things in the kitchen.   Lastly, some other important things I've noticed:  1. Bowls only come in one size, which they consider a 'large' but really comes out with regular sized potions. 2. You cannot split the bill. 3. Automatic gratuity for larger parties. I know many places do this, but my guess is they do this to squeeze every last drop out of you. 4. The lengthy sign about not being a 'fast food' restaurant. Sorry, but slapping a nonsensical sign on the wall as an excuse for slow service doesn't cut it. Pho is always fast, and if it isn't, it better wow my taste buds. The sign also notes that your wait time could DOUBLE if the restaurant is busy. That's 20-40 minutes waiting in a small cramped restaurant with no more than 10 tables. What a sad excuse to avoid hungry impatient customers.   I hope that my lengthy and detailed review has convinced you to search elsewhere to satisfy your pho cravings. Don't be disappointed the way I was. If you love pho as much as I do, STAY CLEAR!!",

The soup was excellent,  not too salty and very tasty. The noodles were in good proportion as well as the meat. Definitely get the pork sausage rolls though.  The sauce they make for is tops it off!  The good thing about this place is that it was cheaper than the strip and it's also better than most food on there. It was also very clean inside. Even though it's small it wasn't crowded. The staff was very friendly and they even refill your water before your done. We gave them a generous tip just because this place was way better than service you'll find any where else near by.",

In addition to the appetizer, we also ordered Pho and a rice plate. The pho broth was flavorful and aromatic while the noodles were just the perfect size and texture. The only thing I didn't like was that the broth was a bit too salty.  There wasn't much of a decor or atmosphere but the staff was very nice.  I will definitely come back here to try other dishes.",

This has to be in my top three meals during my time in vegas. we had gotten two orders of the sausage spring roll, which was so tasty i almost wish i had gotten more, but with all the orders we made, it seemed unwise. Our group of five had 3 orders of the bun bo hue (#77), which you can add sliced cabbage and onions and sprouts to, an order of beef pho (#71), and the vermicelli shrimp crab soup (#78). We had also gotten a vermicelli bowl with porkchop and fried spring roll. Everything was delicious and if i'm ever in vegas again, i will be back! Would def recommend!",

If you use Apple maps, it will get you in the vicinity but you have to a bit harder to find this little establishment.   Three of us ordered Pho and two ordered Bun Bo Hue. Three of us agreed that the soup in pho was lacking the depth in flavor that we would normally find in Little Saigon.  The other two who ordered Bun Bo Hue had favorable comments - highly recommended.  Therefore, the next time we go here will be for the BBH. Other notes about this restaurant. Water - Please add reverse osmosis filter.  The water was awful! Ice Coffee - not recommended.  They need to use better flavor beans like Arabica, not Robusta.",

The restaurant even addresses the issue of their long wait with signs on the wall that say 'our food is made fresh and may take 10-20 minutes to come out. Wait time may be doubled if busy\"  Trust me they're not kidding. Our food took about 35 minutes. For two bowls of pho and spring rolls? .. really? I yelped this place while I was in Vegas because I suspected phoking long would have a really long line so I decided to go somewhere else. If I knew I would be waiting 40 minutes for a bowl of pho I might as well just have gone to phoking long -_-   Spring rolls are good. Large pho doesn't have that much noodles in it.  I suppose I'm supposed to give them credit for posting a disclaimer but they don't post it on the door of the entrance, you can't see it until you actually sit down. And who expects a bowl of pho to take THAT LONG!   Oh on top of that they forgot my order of spring rolls. The restaurant really isn't big at all probably just 15 tables and they have 2-3 servers.   Ehh not coming back, don't care how good the food is.. which is really not that amazing as their sign on the wall claims.",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon around lunch. I was surprised at the location that it's in a business office complex and looked borderline sketchy. My friend from out of town was with me and even said \"Where are you taking me?!\" This place had great reviews which includes some yelpers I know and my brother. There was maybe 2 or 3 parties already there when we were seated and as we waited to order the place started to get pretty packed. As most pho places in Vegas on a Sunday, most of the patrons were hung over youngsters who were at the club from the previous night. I really wanted spring rolls and saw something on the menu that was shrimp egg rolls, but unfortunately it was not the spring rolls I was expecting. It was shrimp wrapped and  deep fried and came with large pieces of lettuce on the side. It was good, but a little greasy. I ordered thin sliced beef, that came with egg rolls, a shrimp cake, and broken rice. I've never had broken rice before and it reminds me of the rice at the bottom of the rice cooker that's been there after awhile and becomes crispy. The beef and egg rolls were good, but I think I would enjoyed this meal more if I had the vermicelli with it instead of the broken rice. This was also my first time trying a shrimp cake and it looked like a piece of spam with batter, but made shrimp instead. Mine was on the greasy side because shiny oil on top was visible. Unlike my friend's shrimp cake his looked less greasier than mine. The service was pretty good because they were attentive throughout our entire meal. I even recognized one of the servers from another Pho place I used to eat at regularly. The inside its self looks like a make-shift restaurant, kind of odd but works? I still prefer other Pho places around the area, but I'll definitely come back for the Pho which is I think they're more known for.",

It seems like it was made by putting the noodles from the bag into the bowl and then poured the soup on rather than dipping the noodles in the boiled soup first to soften the noodles. If you're from Bolsa for real, then by all mean, avoid this imitation \"Bosa\" pho. The bun bo was not close so avoid this as well. It seems like they use the same soup on pho and bun bo. Needless to say that the service was typical asian bad service. The environment is stuffy and not very comfortable.",

Only reason its not a four star is because the lady/waitress/cook? who was taking our orders was also rolling up some eggroll papers on the table next to us. On top of that she was looking at her phone (lots and lots of germs on our phones :/) and touching it then continued rolling. I am usually pretty cool with that stuff, but i wish she took that to the kitchen, and possibly wash her hands! BUT the food was worth FIVE stars!",

What I like about the nem nuong is that it tastes really fresh with just the lettuce, meat, and that crunchy thing in there. They don't add any other fillers to make the roll thicker like some other places. The bun bo hue was really tasty but I would've liked it spicier. Not sure if they had spice on the side you can add in. The com tam [broken rice] is another favorite as well. The portions are decent in size and fills me up. I've also ordered pho togo one day from this place and they give you a lot! The cut of meat was thin and tender and broth tasted very clean. I recommend all my friends here for Vietnamese food. They do have a long wait time for food to come out though, so be prepared for that.",

The meat wasn't the best quality, but there was a lot of it.  It was also the first time I found my noodles to be undercooked.  I love that they did not skimp on the herbs.

We had to wait another additional 30 mins after we ordered our food.  After they brought out our food n drinks, they NEVER came by to ask or check on us.  They never came by n refilled our waters.  That was it, they delivered everything to our table ONCE.  After that they charged us (without any warning or notification) the 15% on our bill n until we asked, that was when they mentioned about their ripped-off n unethical 'Service Charge'.

The Bun Bo Hue is very good,  the eggrolls for $9 bucks appetizer...yeah no!  The rice plate for $12 bucks..yeah no too!  Oh hell no!  To come back here again?  I would have to be desperate..and for the price..I can get better elsewhere.",

    "text": "recommended by friend and said it is one of the best pho he ever had.   The taste, it is so so, comparing with the Pho here in LA  The service, it is really bad. We asked for a well done meats pho and they gave us a raw meat pho. When we complained, one of their waitress just said it is well done and she used a chopstick put the raw meat to the bottom of pho. And said it is well done in front of us.  I was shock by what her action. Nice job!   I have also ordered a Vietnamese coffee but it is too sweet and less feel of coffee.   Overall, don't really trust the rating and what your friend said. Pho is much better here in LA.",

I also got the pork spring roll & that was so good as well. I love the crunchy fried wonton stick they have inside.   The restaurant is very small though with a limited amount of seatings as compared to other pho restaurants. I wouldn't mind coming here again the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Last year, a sad day had fallen upon the Las Vegas community when word of Bosa 1, the amazing Vietnamese restaurant, would be closing its doors. To many peoples, including myself, this restaurant opened my eyes to the \"other\" world of Vietnamese cuisine... one which did not include pho. Here was the first time I had tried broken rice, bbq, and stir fried noodle dishes, that I have since tried at many other restaurants, but have not seen executed to the same high standard. What I missed most about Bosa 1 was that they did make, without a doubt, the best Bun Bo Hue in the Valley.  I was ecstatic to hear that the owner's were opening a new restaurant in Las Vegas called Pho Bosa, which would carry all of the items that Bosa 1 carried, as well as pho. Having procrastinated enough (they have been open for several months), I decided to check out the new location.  Pho Bosa is located on the intersection of Spring Mountain and Polaris. It is right next door to the 702 bar (for now anyways.. that bar has also been the Bikini Bar, and previously before that, the Sand Dollar Blues Lounge) There is plenty of parking, and you really can't miss the sign. After coming in, I was seated immediately by the hospitable host/server. After quickly looking over the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted. It was the dish I was missing the most.. Bun. Bo. Hue. I got a fried egg roll for an extra 1.50. After receiving my water and little side dish of thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime for my soup, my spring roll and soup was brought to me shortly thereafter.   Egg Roll - crispy wonton shell with pork and veggies on the inside. The flavors tasted really well balanced and the shell wasn't too greasy. A little bit small, but tasted good.  Bun Bo Hue - For many of you who have never eaten anything but pho, and really want to try some of the other dishes of Vietnam (and have a liking for spicy foods), I really urge you to try Bun Bo Hue. At Pho Bosa, they make it really well. You can taste the ginger, lemongrass and shrimp in the broth. The chili oil that is mixed in the broth gives it a nice kick! The noodles are more thicker and rounder than ones you see in pho. The beef was tender, and so were the pig's knuckles. Don't be too put off by the congealed pigs blood. It doesn't have a metallic taste you find in beef blood, and IMO, the flavor was very neutral, almost like a tofu. One knock, I wish the broth could have been saltier (but maybe that's because i've been eating a lot ramen in the past year.. it has increased my sodium resistance).  Can't wait to come back and try their broken rice, and grilled specialties. I'm also curious to try their pho, and see how it stacks up against other pho places. The service here was also good.",

On top of that, a 15% service charge (on the after tax amount) for a party of 5 or more seems a bit excessive - especially when you're also pressed to tip them in addition to the service charge. Being charged for every little thing we asked for (e.g. A bit of extra onion for pho), regardless of the final amount, all in all it was not a pleasant dining experience.. I probably won't be back.",

No time for a shower?\" says my Mid West, non Asian poker bud as he gets into the car.  \"What the?!?\" I take personal hygiene seriously unlike the average poker player.  \"Yeah, you smell like an Asian; 'lemongrassy'.\" he continues and laughs.  \"You can get out and walk you know\".  OK so it was True that I just finished one of Pho Bosa's  delicious specialties, Bun Bo Hue, a spicy bowl of collagen laced, beef, lemongrass noodle soup with ginger infused pork blood cake, melting beef tendons, well braised shank, topped with  raw onions, unusual herbs, and the zing of lime.  The perfect balance of sweet, sour, savory, spicy.  Not to be overshadowed, the Bun Rieu (Shrimp and crab soup with vermicelli rice noodles).  Complex flavors from fermented fish sauce, a concentrated chicken broth and shrimp stock,  acidic kick of tomatoes, vibrancy from cilantro, bitterness of green onions and fried tofu for body.  It's just good eats.  Com Tam (broken rice) plates are interesting.  Remember, this is Southeast Asian cooking, everything is overcooked by American standards.  Choose the sides (good egg roll, rubbery quiche and shrimp cake) and a meat (deeply marinated Korean style short ribs, dry pork chop, thin slices of soft beef, flavorful grilled chicken).  Done.  The rice itself is different texturally thanks to smaller grains cooking faster than unbroken grains and starch being released throughout.  Definitely worth a try.  Finally the pho.  A powerhouse of heavily extracted beef flavor and spices.  Heavy mouth feel.  Excellent.  Typical Asian service (you know what I mean).  Reasonable prices.",

The pho is good, noodles and meat options are decent, but my girlfriend, she noticed the soup does tasted a little more oily and greasy than normal. I noticed that too. I got a large bowl, but it looks like a normal size pho. Not that special. But the green Thai tea I got was delightful. It had a different taste to it. It's like the green milk tea I usually order at any Banh Mi Che Cali restaurants in California and this has the same similarities, but different ingredients and similar type of taste appeal they are trying to grab the customers taste buds to it. I think they have their own Bosa cafe where they specializes their own boba drinks. Next time, I should come by the morning and getting their pho, like seafood, because everything does tastes a lot better in the morning or in the late night after you had too many drinks.",

It wasn't until I had a friend recommend Pho Bosa when I realized how watered down and unauthentic the pho I've been eating was. This place has such amazing flavors, I couldn't believe the difference. If you're looking for a decently priced, very delicious pho you have to try this place out. Not to mention the fact that their staff is super friendly and accommodating. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Long overdue review for Pho Bosa. I have been coming here since they were in the Jones location, so over 8-10 years ago?. The consistency has not let me down ever since. It is definitely my friends and my go to pho place in town.   The current location is their biggest location so far. I've gone on weeknights that there were only couple tables, and weekends that's packed with tables and the lines were out of the door.   Service is decent and fast. It's a place you eat and leave.   Here's the items that I usually order:  1. Nem nuong cuon (5/5): it's a spring roll with pork sausage. I enjoy this from Brodard in OC a lot. And Bosa's is really comparable to Brodard. This is my must get item. All my friends and family love it too.   2. Bun bo hue (5/5): my go to pho. This is a spicy Vietnamese beef noodle soup. I enjoy the flavor a lot but I wish it can be more spicy. Ask for their hot sauce in the back.   3. Bun rieu (4/5): when I don't feel like eating beef, I would get this crap noodle soup. It's a tomato base soup with tofu that's on the lighter side.   I also tried various grilled meat with broken rice dishes and regular beef pho. They were pretty good as well.   No one else in town can compare to Pho Bosa on their signature dishes. They definitely are worth checking it out.",

Many fine dining from famous chefs to home cooked meals from the locals within Uber rides away.    The last stop before heading home, we decided to have something light and soothing.  Pho Bosa seemed to fit our needs and recommended from many yelpers.  Our orders were chef's special - Smokey ox tail pho, bun bo hue, and fried egg roll.  Order came in rather slower than the typical Vietnamese restaurant.   Egg roll is nothing outstanding.  The ox tail is the star of the day.  Broth is very clear and has many earthy flavors of onion, cloves, and lime,   The infused Smokey favors aromatic is unbelievable that it smelled as it had just been infused from the Smokey gun directly delivered to the table from the kitchen.  Ox tail is tender and meaty.  It had big three pieces in the bowl, but it is enough meat for one serving.    The bun bo hue is ok, typical favors of spicy beef broth with a hint of tomato to enhance your appetizer, however, I prefer the bolder heat.  Great recommendations.",

They have these chef special ox tail pho that we ordered and it was very tasty and rich in flavor. To my taste, it was a tad bit more on the sweet side. The portion was humongous though! Considering it's $17.99 for the ox tail, lololol.    Their spring rolls were made with spam and they have the fried wonton skins inside as well to make it crunchy.   The pork blood in the bun bo hue was sweet... I do not like. The broth tasted alright, thought it could be richer.   They also offer a wide selection of beverages and I've tried the sugarcane coconut, which was an odd combination that tasted good.   Service was nice and the restaurant is pretty spacious.",

We got here at 10:50 am and there a few party there already. We got sat down pretty quickly and were provided menus and water immediately.  We order the two pho special, two nem cuon ( pork sausage spring rolls) and the nem nuong vermicelli. First thing you do is taste the pho soup before adding the condiments. You can taste if the broth is authentic or from powder. Luckily for us, it was authentic! The nem cuon was surprisingly good and refreshing on a typical hot summer morning in Vegas. I had the nem nuong vermicelli as my entree. As you can tell, I like nem a lot. I didn't feel like having pho on a hot day.  The service was okay. The waiter gave me attitude when I asked him to reseal my green Thai milk tea because I spilled some content trying to mix it. The green Thai milk tea tasted like pandan so it's different from the traditional Thai milk tea some are use to.   I did like that the portion here was pretty big and they didn't skimp out on the protein!",

I took a star away for 1.the wait (about 30mins to be sat and 15mins for food to table), 2.the staff not explaining the process of waiting, 3.the smallest waiting area ever -- so really it's nothing about the food but just the beginning of the experience. That said it was worth the wait and worth the confusion about seating. FYI: write your name on the list (if there is a wait) and the total amount of guest. No need to wait for staff to write your name and tell you how long; they'll say they don't know lol",

So worth the price split it with my friend couldn't eaten a whole if we wanted to/had more time though.   Didn't like vietnamese roll the sausage or whatever meat it was was weird, not your typical roll from when i've ordered it at other places before. The fried spring roll was super good though nice and crunchy and good filling. Perfect with fish oil and lettuce and there were like 6-8 or something?! In comparison to 2 vietnamese rolls cut in half (clear skin i thought that was called the summer roll maybe?)",

    "text": "I am pretty sure this is one of the best, if not the best, Vietnamese places in town. Everything is so well prepared, flavorful, and prompt service. Also, while this place was poppin on a Sunday afternoon, me and my boyfriend got seated pretty quickly because their turnaround was so fast. This is the type of place that you - for lack of better description - come to eat. It's not fancy, but this is a foodie spot for sure. Anyway, enough of the background story--more into the food.   I got the combination pho, pork sausage Vietnamese rolls, and a mango/pineapple basil seed drink   1) pho: best pho I have had -- counting places in Michigan. I'm sorry I'm not Vietnamese so I can't speak to any mother's at home cooking, but for restaurants in Vegas this is easily one of the best. The broth is so beefy and rich, and had the perfect amount of onion vs anise ratio. Also, this is the best beef ball I've had in pho. Seriously-- it's so juicy and flavorful.   2) pork sausage spring rolls - AHHHmazing (sorry if that expression is from 2007). But these were super fresh, the sausage was juicy and tasty as well, plus they put a bit of the wrapper from the fried egg roll in it too. Their 13? 14? Spice peanut sauce is super good too. Together, these created the perfect bite! Texture wise and taste wise too, v cohesive  3) my drank - a bit too sweet for my liking, but again very good textures! The chewiness of the basil + bits of fruit were so good. Very refreshing for the Vegas heat, although I had this in the midst of the windy \"winter\"   All in all, it was an awesome experience that I will be sharing for generations to come. It is kind of in an unannounced spot on Twain and valley view, but adds to its genuinity. Thank you Bosa!",

Bosa service:  Every visit we've been seated immediately which is one of the main reasons I frequent here.  The kitchen gets the dishes out quickly and keeps the drinks fresh as well.  Drinks are self serve which I prefer at smaller mom and pop restaurants.  Bosa Grindage:  All the Pho bowls I've consumed consistently have had flavorful broth and noodles.  The Pho with oxtail was a special which I hope makes it to the menu permanently.  I always appetize up with the the Pork Fresh Rolls, super yummy.  The rice plates come loaded with: rice, egg rolls, egg cake plus whatever meat/protein you selected.  The dining area is super casual as all mom and pop joints area and it's clean and there's plenty of seating for a small restaurant which makes for consistent immediate seating.  The menu is extensive with lots of Pho bowls and dishes to sample for a great price.  This will bring me back for more visits but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)",

Summer months, opt for the COM Tam bi cha thit nuong, meat is grilled to perfection, even better than Little Saigon in OC and I am from the OC area. Best Asian place in Vegas!! So glad they move to this bigger place, million times BETTER than Kim Long for pho, bun, com, everything but too bad they don't open 24hrs otherwise they would put Kim Long out of business. Soups are perfectedLy flavored, rice portions are HUGE. We always end our Vegas trip by stopping here before heading back to OC.

    "text": "As a former Californian, I was devastated after moving to Las Vegas. The Vietnamese food scene here is lackluster (but slowly improving). Luckily, I was quickly introduced to Bosa 1 for their amazing rice plates. Not long thereafter, I fell in love with their fantastic bun bo hue and bun rieu...just like my mom used to make!!  The portions are generous, the ingredients fresh and of superb quality. You can taste the homemade goodness in everything -- from the perfectly-cooked broken rice to the moist egg quiche to the amazing lemongrass bun bo hue broth.  I used to eat at the old location at least 2-3 times a week. And during their several-month hiatus/relocation, I was like a druggie on withdrawal. I *craved* a good rice plate, and I must've visited every single Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas to get my fix. But alas, I was met with disappointment EVERY SINGLE TIME. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when Pho Bosa reopened; it was like my dealer had teased me so I would want more, and I've definitely been back many times to reclaim that euphoria.  I work as a VIP concierge at a large upscale resort/casino on the Strip, and I'm often asked where to get pho/Vietnamese food. You can be sure I never send them to the TI(t)!! Every guest that had taken my advice has come back raving about the wonderful food, service and prices.  Bosa 1/Pho Bosa is the best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, hands down! But don't just take my word for it; check out what these other local media outlets have to say:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lasvegasweekly.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2Foct%2F03%2Fvegas-best-vietnamese-back-and-better-ever%2F&s=201664cdafce7ff4689df72a86b9baf5c4013162c595f569d008e742aa647f39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lasvegasweekly.com/news/...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatinglv.com%2F2009%2F08%2Fbosa-1-boffo-vietnamese%2F&s=a987101556404e5f38e69c050810f534bd79dbcc1dc1c5bbd03b8f6eefe2d66d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinglv.com/2009/08/bos...</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lasvegasweekly.com%2Fnews%2F2009%2Fjul%2F09%2Fbosa-truly-no-1%2F&s=bd8ac8e185ab60ab755fe9930a4453a173618addbb9c5920c00bb670a741cd1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lasvegasweekly.com/news/...</a>  With their new location comes extended open hours, credit card payments and a slightly larger dining area. The staff is still just as friendly and accommodating. Do note that they are closed on Wednesdays. If you're a lucky local or just a Vegas visitor, do not miss the chance to enjoy the great offerings at this humble but wonderful restaurant.  _________________________________________ And in response to Sandra C. from Encino, CA: Honey, if you actually read the reviews like you claim you did, you'll notice that this is the reincarnation of their first store, Bosa 1.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bosa-1-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/bosa-1-las-...</a>  How about you check out their nearly-100 high-ranked reviews there before making yourself look like an idiot. And another thing, I've worked at several businesses (large and small) where they use ipads for signing. Most people are STUPID and use their fingernails REGARDLESS of how much you emphasize to use their actual fingers. With your attitude, your bad experience must've been of your own making anyway. I feel sorry for you; it must be impossible to ever make you happy. Perhaps you should just go rejoin all the hipsters at Pho Kim Long, as that seems to be more your scene.",

They were tasteless pieces of pork hocks.  I have to make sure I have spoonfuls of the soup before I eat the pork hocks. Otherwise, the soup is fragrant and delicious.  I tried Earl's food and there were tons of flavor in his bowl of yum yum stuff.   The eggroll was nice and crispy, the shrimpcake was tasty, and nem nuong (pork patty) was perfect.

Very affordable, great service (kind enough to call us a cab and allow us to sit inside while waiting to escape the heat-- despite our many items of baggage clogging up their narrow front doorway!), great product. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Pho Bosa definitely fits the description of \"hole in the wall\" kind of joint, because the restaurant interior is small and feel constricted. The furniture look like they were bought from garage sale or flea market and the building looks kind of run-down. The look might scare some potential customer away.   HOWEVER, once you tried their specialty \"Bun Bo Hue\", you will want to come back for more. I've lived in Vegas for 9 years and this place (on the average) still has the best Bun Bo Hue in town. Their other specialty is broken rice dishes (com tam), which is good but not exceptional. Their Pho is okay too, not bad.  Lately, I noticed food came out much faster than before. I believe they might have more staff in the kitchen and therefore reduced the time it takes for food to come out.   FYI, they close on Wednesday and sometimes on other days too, so if you live far from this place, it's best to call ahead to make sure they open that day.",

Pho Bosa popped up with a decent amount of reviews, both mixed with 5 stars and 1/2's.   I'm always the type of person to try a place even though it has a couple of OK reviews, just for my own opinion.  Presentation: Small little mom and pop joint. Not the nicest place but, this is what I imagine what mom and pop stops look like.  Wait: We were seated immediately. It took us about 5-10 minutes to look at the menu before we ordered.  Customer Service: The customer service deserves a 5 Star. The waiter was fast with water refills, persistent, and did his job well.   Food: I was a little disappointed in their Pho Dac Biet. Which is the original pho that comes with tendon, brisket, meatballs, meat etc., you know.. the usual. The meat was tough, and the texture was over cooked, the broth was.. just not good. The best part of it was the meatballs. My husband ordered one as well with some spring rolls and let me tell you, those were DELICIOUS. I'll definitely come back for those, and probably try something new!  Overall: I wouldn't get the Pho, But I would definitely come back for the spring rolls and willing to try a new soup!",

Opening hours are as follows, based on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobosakitchen.com%2F&s=ad254a976ef271be723c6ad71e1d22477e0f66801a479c3fd581faad37582873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phobosakitchen.com</a>: MONDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm TUESDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm WEDNESDAY closed THURSDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm FRIDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm SATURDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm SUNDAY10:00 am to 9:30 pm  Pho Bosa also offers fresh sugar cane and fresh coconut.  We entered and were immediately greeted by the host. There was plenty of seating available, so we selected a booth towards the front of the restaurant.  Menus were provided and drinks were requested from our waiter. We asked for a Boba Tea, 2 waters, and a soda. Afterwards, my family and I ordered the following  [1] Rice w/ Chicken [Combo that came with egg roll and various other sides] [1] Panini with chicken, pesto, and tomato  The meals came out relatively quickly and the waiter was quite attentive to our table. We often had our drinks refilled numerous times. The food was hot when it came out.  The rice was soft, not overcooked and flavorful, especially with the grilled chicken on-top. The grilled chicken tasted good, with a nice BBQ style marinade. It wasn't burnt, or under-cooked.   The Panini was good. There was a gracious amount of chicken inside along with the tomatoes. The bread tasted like it had been baked in the morning at the restaurant.   The service is awesome at this place! If I am in the area again, I'll have to stop by Pho Bosa one more time!",

Not only homely ambience, service staff is fantastic... my kids and I started off with coconut milk tea, honeydew smoothie, regular milk tea and another smoothie I can't remember the name of... well worth the price for their over sized LARGE cups and so flavorful! My coconut milk tea was the absolute bomb!   Then came our orders.... meatball pho, shrimp pho and 2 orders of spring rolls... their service was so personable as they came back to our tables many times even having conversations with my kids... one of my kids said \"this is the best restaurant ever\".... going back to their pho broth.... the story is... 8 years ago when they first started, it tasted like sh*t, but they didn't give up until they reached the broth they have today.... very rich and smooth.... very clean flavor. And the bowls are large size! I couldn't finish it... Again... I'm from Alhambra and I've eaten pho at many many restaurants.... theirs is the best I've had.   Their spring rolls are larger than I'm used to, filled with pork sausage and lots of fresh vegetables with killer peanut sauce (still warm)  that they serve with tiny little spoons so we don't make mess everywhere.... it's the details!!    The best part? The sample of their chef's oxtail special! Broth was so deep and cleeeeeean.... even my kids' verbal expressions with taste of 1 spoonful of their broth and 1 piece of oxtail were \"oh my God... we're coming back...\"  And we are....  Update.... we came back 3 nights straight.... my kids didn't want to eat anywhere else... next year this is their first stop....",

    "text": "We saw the good reviews on Yelp so decided to try this place out. When we first walked through the door, not a single staff greeted us. They all just looked at us like we did not belong there. I proceeded to ask if we should seat ourselves and finally one of the staff told us to wait for a table to be setup. I looked around and there were several tables open with only a few occupied by other customers...We then waited almost an hour to order and finally get our food!  We came mainly for the spring rolls and was super disappointed. The sauce was terrible, and the spring rolls tasted nothing like the ones we got in Cali. Not sure what people were raving about. The bun bo hue was decent. The com tam rice dishes were good but did not come with any dipping sauce. They had some clear watered down fish sauce at the table that tasted more like vinegar.  We were also charged automatic gratuity at the end since we had a party of 5 or more (4 adults and 2 kids under 4). That may explain the lack of customer service. Please note that they don't provide receipts so if you want one, you would have to give them your email address so they could email it to you!   Overall, it was a negative experience for us and I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "Pho Bosa is absolutely Pho-Bo(sa)- lous! I love this modest Vietnamese eatery located in an unassuming Chinatown strip mall on the right most side abutting a pizza parlour. The conspicuous and bold red signs reading PHO BOSA VIETNAMESE KITCHEN are hard to miss. With ample parking, air conditioning and conspicuous health advertisements, this place is exactly how you would want your pho joint to look like - a little rough on the surface but delicious on the inside.   The service is incredibly fast - it may be helpful to review the extensive menu prior to your visit as to prevent that glazed \"I-don't-know-what-to-get\" look of a Pho Bosamateur.   My favorites? (1) Cococane!   Can't decide between sugarcane juice and coconut water? This love child born out of the delicious affair of the fresh pressed sugarcane and coconut water is so refreshingly cool and delicious. The pieces of fresh coconut flesh were creamy and ripe. It was my absolute favorite part of the meal - the perfect chill to round out the hot desert trek.  The size of the drink is quite large and sufficient for two people.   (2) Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef Noodle Soup)  Round, thick rice noodles, stewed pork shank, tendons, and ginger infused pork blood are served in fragrant and spicy beef and lemongrass infused broth, into which you add fresh herbs and white onions.   Note: I recommend requesting to remove the pork blood - but this is a personal tapreference.  (3) Hay Bun (Vermicelli Noodle Bowl) Feeling less soupy and more crunchy? The varieties of Hay Bun are a great alternative and you can select your choice of protein over vermicelli noodles, bed of lettuce, mint, basil, carrot-daikon mixture, cucumbers, peanuts and green onions.   Pho Bosa, you're the Cococane - Bun Bo Hue Boss...a of Las Vegas!",

In Vegas, you can find a lot cheap eats but one thing I have noticed is Vietnamese food isn't that cheap!   My friend and I ordered the combination dac biet pho ($9.50) and egg rolls (cha gio) ($10 with vegetables, $8 sans vegetables) and a Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da) for $4.50 each. Our total bill came out to be $45 with tax and tip - a little bit on the expensive end, similar to prices you'd pay for pho in the Bay Area, and much higher price for egg rolls than usual!   In terms of flavor, the pho broth was pretty tasty but it was very oily. The egg rolls were okay - but the vegetables that accompanied the egg rolls were old (e.g lettuce had brown spots from not being fresh). The Vietnamese coffee was as you'd expect at any Vietnamese establishment-- except its pretty large and worth the $4.50.  Overall, Pho Bosa is overpriced Vietnamese food with decent flavor. If you want to pay Bay Area prices for your food, then come here! The only bargain that can be had here is their iced coffee...",

It's one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants!   One of my favorite dishes ever is com tam, which is a rice plate with meat and a few other things like shredded pork, egg quiche, and shrimp wrapped in tofu skin. Unfortunately, not a lot of places in Vegas make good com tam which is why I am SO glad to have found Pho Bosa! I ordered the grilled pork and really enjoyed it, it almost brought a little tear to my eye LOL. My sister always gets the tofu spring rolls and my mom raves about the banh mi. I usually don't get boba at restaurants but decided to get their green Thai tea and it was amazing. My sister got a taro slush with popping boba and that was great as well.   It seems like everything they make here is incredible and I can go on and on about why you should try it out for yourself! Our server MO was so freaking awesome as well as everyone else here like the guy who refilled our waters and the cashier - they were all so friendly. Can't wait to come back!!",

The first sip of the broth confirmed that they knew what they were doing and had a good base to begin with. A few bites in you got to the taste fatigue point - so was nice to add some extras (some additional basil, some extra sprouts, etc) to keep things interesting.  The summer rolls / tofu rolls left something to be desired. Lacked the feeling of freshness you would want to see or experience, but all good. The pho was the highlight. Probably would not drop by too frequently if Las Vegas was my regular stomping ground, but if I was in need of a pho fix. This place does just fine.",

I ordered a rice plate and was missing some items that were listed on the menu and the server said it's a typo and that i have to order the missing item additionally. Also the fish sauce that comes with the rice and noodle dish is a joke. It's literally just bottled fish sauce and they tell you to mix it with the red chili garlic sauce (the one with the green cap sold at Asian stores) to make your fish sauce. See my picture for yourself to see. Service was also horrible. No water refills and no return after delivering food to see how everything is. The food itself wasn't that good. Will not be coming back or recommending to others.",

I believe the steamy pho broth really hit the spot for many. The vermicelli shrimp crab soup was really unique unlike any other I have tasted and extremely flavorful. My \"bun\" - rice vermicelli with grilled pork and egg rolls was also super-yummy and texturally delightful. I really enjoyed the  combination of fresh vegetables and the aromatic grilled meats, rich egg rolls and flavorful fish sauce.   In addition to the dishes, they also serve a variety of specialty drinks such as milk teas and fruit snow drinks. I was so excited to see that they serve sugarcane juice but it was rather tasteless and not at all sweet or \"sugarcane-like\". Perhaps it was not the right season for it or I just got a bum sugarcane.",

    "text": "I think Vegas has the best food off strip and for some reason, there is always the amazing Pho place in a weird strip mall that you would just drive right by. (And drive right by we did. The lyft driver missed the entrance to the strip mall twice.)  We got there and as we opened the door saw so many vietnamese people inside and we got super excited! There were many specials that were off menu and for a sucker for specials I knew I had to get it. There was a sign for oxtail pho and fresh sugar cane juice, so I got oxtail pho and sugar cane juice.   The sugar cane juice was so fresh and sweet with just a touch of pulp. Perfect way to cool down in the Las Vegas heat. It was quite a large portion (think starbucks grande and then a little bit taller) for the price, I thought it was pretty good value.   The famous oxtail pho, now as I read other reviews, I asked beforehand how much it would be as it was kind of mixed. The server told me it was $17.99 and that's how much it showed up as in the bill. Just for your own peace of mind, ask them in case it shows up as something else on your bill. The oxtail was cooked so tender and had this smokey flavour that was so surprising. I've never had an oxtail pho quite like this! There was a very generous amount of oxtail and it was a larger bowl than normal so you could share this between 2 people and order some appitizers. Definitely recommend it was super delicious!  We also got a fresh roll with sausage(?) It was sooooo good! There was a tiny crunchy spring roll thing in the middle to give it a good crunch and toasty flavour! Was super delicious definitely recommend.  Tldr; if you feinding for some specialty pho this is the place to go! Although their regular soups were pretty tasty as well",

My sis make a bomb BBH, so not that many places will stack up to hers.  i can honestly attest that this was pretty good.  pho: where do you begin?  such generous portions of meat, mountains of pho noodles, and very meaty broth. the toddler slurped his bowl as if he just ran a 2K marathon.  the item that's worth writing to Mommy and Aunt's & Uncles about is... drum roll please... smoked short rib pho.  it truly is worth the $17.99 price tag.  so much flavor packed in a bowl.  i wouldn't even call it a bowl, i'd say you got a baby bathtub of pho.  LOL. calling it huge or gigantic is still an understatement.  i mean, where can you get a bowl that big? the smokiness of the meat did not seep into the broth and cause and unsavory bitterness.  it was just perfect.  Next time i'm in Sin City, this would be the place i'd frequent again.  Decor not too trendy, but happy workers with genuine smiles, and soul-filling food makes up for decor.",

I forgot the exact name of what I got but I can tell you what it came with and not my surprise it was a lot! It had rice, meat (with bone), fried tofu, soup, and some veggies. My family all ordered the same thing since it was so yummy. We also tried their sugar cane juice and it's really good just like in Vietnam. I definitely recommend coming here, not only was the food great but the service was too! Our waiter was friendly and not to mention really funny. Overall experience was best for a first timer that just got off the plane and was super hungry!",

The signage indicated \"Blacked Smokey Oxtail Pho\" ... just sounded too good to pass up!  We didn't ask for prices and it turned out up be $18.99 for each bowl....  a bit pricey at a glance but it was totally worth it.  OMG .. it is the best tasty perfectly seasoned oxtail that you'll ever have!!!!!    Honestly, the soup is a tad salty but it's fine.  The pho is cooked perfectly and noodles didn't clump.  We slurped up every bit of pho and ate up every last piece of piece on that oxtail bone... mmm.'mmmmmzmzzmmm  ... yum!!!  What I also appreciate their pho the most is the hot soup.  The soup stayed piping hot the whole time during our meal even during this cold weather.  I so appreciate that!!   The other highlight is the fresh spring roll with pork sausage.  Honestly it is one of the BEST spring roll i've ever had.  And, their special peanut sauce... you can just slurp that all up!!   The fresh spring roll was this perfect blend of warm sausage + cool lettuce + room temperature peanut sauce.  Inside was a perfect balance of pork sausage (perfectly seasoned)+ crispy wonton + crunchy lettuce + warm spring roll skin.  OH SOOOO GOOOOOODDDD!!!!!  Overalll an awesome experience with excellent food!!  Love this place!!!!!  Thanks Yelp!",

Then we ordered 2 different Pho and a beef short rib over rice dish which was made into a combo with egg, shrimp cake and an egg roll. The short rib was on the chewy side, the shrimp cake was greasy. The Pho broth was amazing- each sip tasted like the broth was brewed for hours. We were there about 2 in the afternoon and the place was pretty packed then. I would recommend this place if you are a Pho lover. I haven't had this amazing broth for a while now.",

The combination of Chinese pork and picked veggies and garlic mayo on a perfect roll was heavenly. Washed it down with a bubble tea.

The exterior was very dark and you cant see the restaurant from the outside bec. of the dark tinted windows. It was located in a peculiar looking business establishment with offices around it.   The food was good plain and simple. We ordered the spring rolls which was freshly made by them unlike other restaurants that serves you frozen spring roll.   We also ordered the beef and pork toppings with rice served with pickles which was good for our sweet and spicy taste buds.   The last item we ordered was the clear soup with shredded beef and balls. This was probably one of their specialty soups in the restaurant and it was worth it.   The price was around 10 bucks for the soup and 9 bucks for the beef and pork toppings with rice.    Service was what you expect in a small Asian restaurant very passive. The inside was clean and service was quick.",

Are my standards way too high because I didn't really understand all the hype on the Bun Bo Hue here -____- \"  Am I crazy or is there not a wide population of Vietnamese people here? We seriously need a a Vietnamese family to open up the back of their home and set up shop for us or something because I really have a hard time finding a nice, enjoyable, bowl of pho in this town.   This has been placed in my bookmarks list for quite sometime now because all the rave I've been reading about their Bun Bo Hue. I love love love Bun Bo Hue ..when it's done right. Came here with merherhh (bf) and we ordered pork egg rolls that looked like Filipino lumpias more so than Vietnamese egg rolls -- long and skinny (that's what she said). They weren't that bad. I liked the fact that they gave some noodles and cucumbers with it so you could make your own fried spring roll concoction.   Merhherh ordered the Pho and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Both were bland in flavor :| Just tasted watered down to me. I would say, maybe since it was at the end of the night so the food was lacking as they were about to close? But no, shouldn't it be even more flavorful cause the broth would be absorbing the flavor of the ingredients all day? Either way, just not my cup of tea, or rather bowl of pho.  Another thing I wasn't very fond of was that they just provide a bottle of fish sauce by the table. Not homemade?! Fish sauce in a bottle was not pleasing with my egg rolls :(   This place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall and I usually enjoy discovering hole-in-the-walls more so then fancy smancy places, but I was honestly alert my whole visit waiting for a cockroach to make its way across the floor.   I guess I set my expectations a little too high. It being a hole-in-the-wall I was expecting some good ol authentic Vietnamese food. I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, but definitely didn't make my top favorites list :X",

The broth they use is so good and doesn't really need sauce, except if you need more spice. The broken rice is so yummy, the meat is very well marinated. The vermicelli bowls are to die for. Pretty much every time I come in here, they never disappoint. The service is great as well and they are very friendly. The location is a little weird and the place is small, but is closer to the strip than the other places so that's great news for tourists. They will be opening another location soon that will be a lot bigger than this one, so that solves any claustrophobic issues you may have with this location. This is definitely the best Vietnamese place here in Vegas.",

Growing up with many Chinese friends, I have a total soft spot for Chinese sausages. These spring rolls were so delicious! The flavors and textures were all there! The rolls had this crunchy deep fried roll behind the sausage, giving this a great crunch. The house peanut sauce was delicious! - combo: egg rolls, shrimp cake, grilled pork sausage (#25): the egg rolls were crispy, the shrimp cake nice and crispy, the sausage nice and meaty. This made me so happy while I was eating it, even if my friend was sadly struggling to eat her pho across the table from me  Pros: - food! I can't speak for the pho, but the rolls and rice dish I had was delicious!  - service: they were surprisingly busy for a late Monday morning, but they tried their best, which I appreciated. They were also very tech savvy taking payment with their iPad. - price is decent  Cons: - small so I could see how there would be a wait for this place  Would I come again? Sure! :)",

You could tell they don't get many tourists here because they asked if it was our first time, offered to wrap up our leftovers, and said \"see you next time!\" as we left.  This made me like this place immediately.  Overpriced tourist traps (the opposite of Pho Bosa) were exactly what we were trying to avoid.  I've been to Vietnam and it has my favorite food anywhere in the world, and prices about 1/20th of what you'll pay at any hole in the wall in the US, so it's hard for me to give anywhere 5 stars.  I also have to dock some points because the reason we chose Pho Bosa was for the wrap it yourself spring roll platter and they didn't have it available.  But the food that we did have was delicious..  We ordered the: Vietnamese Salad Noodle Bowl with Chicken Sausage Chicken Sausage Vietnamese Spring Roll Tofu Vietnamese Spring Roll Vermicilli Shrimp Crab Soup  If I lived in Las Vegas I would be here all the time.  Note that the restroom facilities aren't the best.. they are outside the restaurant and not the most hygienic.. but hey, it's a hole in the wall restaurant.",

Needless to say, when we arrived and faced another 45min wait, the only thing that kept me there was the fact that it was 45C & burning outside in Vegas and this tiny resto at least had AC we could seek shelter from  I was wrong; the food was just excellent.  The server was so kind and gave us tips on transportation from the resto, and we ordered their classic pho.  Texture was great and flavour was deliciously present, but the winner of the day was probably the iced Vietnamese coffee.  Not too sweet but gave us all kinds of caffeinated happiness; we decided to get their vermicelli and rice dishes for take out as a quick meal for the next day.  Even though we ate the takeout cold the next day, it was still full of flavour and enjoyable.  If you're trying to save $ in Vegas while not losing out on quality, Pho Bosa is it",

We yelped a pho place, but it was closed down so we found ourselves at Pho Bosa.  When we entered the restaurant we were rudely greeted and said we would have to wait for a seat in their small and dirty restaurant.  When we were seated the waitress was also rude to us as well.  To make things worse, they have these signs on their walls that basically states you are not in a fast food restaurant so be patient for your food.  Obviously, if you are at a restaurant there will be a wait and it's pretty unnecessary for them to post that sign.  I ordered bun bo hue which was decent for vegas.    The gentleman that came to bus our tables after we ate and he asked me if I like my bun bo hue with a native tone and it confused me for a bit because he didn't look Vietnamese.   In any case, wish we encountered him earlier because he was friendlier than the rest of the people that work there.",

The owner and staff were very nice except for the Asian lady (there were 2 of them at that time;it was the one with straight long hair). She came up to our table several times to get our orders and bring our food. We all noticed that she was giving us an attitude. Had her eyebrow raised at all times whenever she faced us but she was good with other customers. We couldn't understand why she would be rude towards us. It was from beginning to end. When we were ready to pay the bill, we were going to pay with both cash and credit card. She said they don't \"split checks\" and so we couldn't pay that way. We told her we weren't asking for split checks and we understood that they charge for gratuity for large parties. But she just said NO. Right before leaving, my friend asks for a bag and she drops it on the counter. My friend (by this time,she's had enough of this lady's rudeness) asked if she was ok. Asian lady said she was tired and so my friend said she should go home as she thinks it's not good that she's putting it on customers who are there to eat. It's not like they are serving people for free either. Asian lady then throws her pen and pad on the desk and starts cussing at my friend, IN FRONT OF OUR KIDS- infant, 1, 3, 5 and 6 year olds. It was a shocking experience for all of us and traumatic for the kids. We're still trying to figure out what the hell her problem was with our families. She's definitely bringing bad vibes to their business. Food was good though.  *originally gave 1 star, but the rest of the staff were nice and friendly and we enjoyed their food. One falling star for the rude lady.",

Don't get me wrong, PKL is awesome because it's good and is open 24/7 and has lots of spacious seating.  But the wait is usually 30-45 minutes at minimum since everyone needs their hangover cure.  Pho Bosa tastes just as good (probably, I mean come on, it all tastes good after a night of clubbing).  I'd definitely rather come here with no wait than PKL.  Plenty of parking, no line, decent seating.  Party of 9 was seated immediately at 1130AM on a sunday.  Aside from the lack of crowd and wait, the pho is really good here.  Additionally, they are really popular for their bun bo hue and also serve bun rieu, which is hard to find decent quality of.

Plates have always been the star for both the BF and me. They changed the way the plates are so there is more customization on the items you have in your combo whereas it used to be set items aside from the main meat dish. We both got plates with shrimp cake and eggrolls and I picked grilled pork sausages and the BF got BBQ pork. Everything good, as expected. It's the best broken rice plate you're going to get in Vegas. I wish they bottled their seasoned fish sauce! It is clean and balanced and I want to douse it on everything. They're doing a free soda with a Yelp check-in and that was oddly the only bump in the visit. It was flat and odd tasting according to the BF who ordered a coke.  Service is just as friendly and attentive which I have come to expect when you go to eat at Bosa. It's one of the few Asian establishments that have amazing service.   It's easily missed when driving by it. If you see the Bikini Bar it is next to it and the Zombie Apocalypse store is across the street on Polaris.  Course, now that the namesake is Pho I have to come back (very soon, I hope) to try this and indulge and their two other soups: Bun Rieu and Bun Bo Bue.

It was well-balanced and aromatic.  The bun bo hue also had all of the correct ingredients--blood cubes and all.   Cons: Lemon instead of lime was served with the pho, likely due to increased lime costs. However, the lime is irreplaceable. Also, most of the bun bo hue I've eaten in my day is several levels hotter. This one was only mild-medium spicy; not nose running spicy as I've experienced before. I think this is the type of soup that calls for more spiciness.",

The response that I got was, \"are you stupid?, can't you read it yourself?  I am too busy to serve you\"  For this reason, I left this hole in the wall place with disgust, and as I was leaving, the waiter shouted, \"GOOD LUCK to you\"",

I really should wait until I try their pho and also make sure their Bun Bo Hue is still legit before I write this review. But what the heck. Pho Bosa is as good as it gets.  Yes, this is based on my one lunch visit today whereby I ordered the Bun Rieu and promptly proceeded to inhale it. Yes, their interior and exterior leave a ton to be desired. Yes, it's strange that you have to go outside to access the restrooms. Yes, they... actually that's all I can think of.  I'm definitely going back for the Bun Bo Hue.",

    "text": "Okay...i promised in my previous review i was going back to try out the rice plate or the Bun Bo Hue...didnt exactly plan on going back the next day but hey what ever; go where life takes you right?  Left out from my previous review but dont feel like editing it.  Number 15 on the drinks. Sua Dau Nanh La Dua (soy bean milk with pandan leaf) It's been a long time since i've had soy bean milk and the kind with pandan leaf is a rare treat. So i was expecting a can of Yeo brand soya milk with pandan leaf that comes from Singapore i think. When they released this flavor i used to not drink a can but inhale a can. Anyway what i was brought out was in a togo container. Punching the straw through and taking a sip i realized that holy shit this is home made soy bean with pandan extract added. Nice!! not overly sweet but not bland either. Could have used more pandan leaf extract but i'm just weird like that.  Alright back to today. Well if i'm gonna order something with the intent to review it i might as well order it big: Number 11. Tau Hu Ky, Bi Cha with number 16 Thit Nuong (shrimp cake, shredded pork loin, pork quiche with additional grilled pork)  The portion size is pretty big and the meal itself was quite tasty and impressive. The grilled pork was the tastiest on the plate. Marinated quite well and the thin cuts absorbed enough seasonings to be both tasty but not dry and rubbery and doesn't get in those hard to reach places in your teeth.  Yup Bosa 1 is back and better then ever.",

The good: very strong beefy flavor, very generous portions of beef, double than other pho places, beef very sliced very thin and was tender.  The bad: a bit on the salty side, the spice flavor was very subtle (star anise, cinnamon, etc.) which was probably overwhelmed by the beef flavor.  Price was a bit higher and it takes a little longer for the food to come out.  If you like pho with a strong beef flavor, this is your place.",

    "text": "Best hangover food ever!  Food: My favorite thing here is their spring rolls. The ratio of meat to veggie to wrap is perfect and the flavor of the meat is right on point. The sauce is also delicious. I always add a little chili to it and keep it as a dipping sauce for the meat from my pho. The pho is good quality. The broth is well seasoned and really soothing to your stomach. I always get the combination which comes with tendons that are perfectly tender and a few different kinds of meat. They have big portions. I can never finish my $8 bowl. They also have really good Vietnamese coffee. The one with condensed milk is like a dessert, sweet and rich. I always get the black coffee which has sugar but is not as heavy. Service: The servers always look friendly and the food comes decently fast. Even though there was a line when we got there around noon it went fairly quickly and we were seated after just a 15-20min wait. Location: The restaurant is in a small kind of dingy plaza off the strip. There's plenty of parking and it's not as crowded as some of the other popular food places. Pho Bosa is a great choice of you're on you're way out of Vegas after a weekend of clubbing.",

But unfortunately the pho dac biet that I ordered was tasteless, vegetables weren't fresh, and the bowl size would be considered a regular size compared to others.

I got the scaled down version by one item I believe but the highlight or thing most looking forward too besides the Short RIbs (Kalbi) was the quiche. Now it been while since I had any kind of quiche. Vietnamese restaurant? Who would have thought be without question best little piece of quiche ever had in Vegas. There also was the spring rolls that was not only cooked too perfection, nice crispy on outside till golden brown, and filling hot moist and again delicious on the inside. Not even talking about shredded pork along with couple sliced cucumbers and kind of carrot salad. Soo much going on with all these components on any of the broken rice plates. All that is going on what truly stands OUT is each part could see having whole plate of just by itself!!!!! Talk about filling any one of these broken rice plates sure getting  money worth. I not able too finish all my rice because really the whole bottom of the plate or just about had rice. Me growing up on rice loving every scoop of it!  The Kalbi might not be as meaty as other more local style restaurants but smaller ones feel so much more flavor packed in it. The marinade they do is fabulous! Not too sweet but just the right amount of balance. Broken rice plates see lot more in my future.  The service yet again on top of it. They were even helpful came too my first time ordering broken rice dish explaining too me use the fish sauce over the rice and the shredded pork. I would have never thought of if they never suggested it! It small place but think started up right now never bad time too go. So if never been too Pho Bosa you should give it try. Between the different types of Pho and Broken Rice Plates that all you need!!",

This place is small and looks like a hole-in-the-wall joint that would be very good. The wait is pretty bad if you come with a big party, expect to be separated into two groups. I want to say we waited for around an hour for 7 people.   I ordered the Bun Bo Hue because apparently that's their signature item. I found it to be bland and they also weren't too generous with the meat.   On another note, my friend ordered a rice plate and it literally did not come out until almost all of us were done eating. We had to ask them about it twice. Its pretty hard to get the servers attention here since its pretty busy. They did take that order off of our check though.",

Waiting 3/5: I would've given them a 2 out of 5, but since they DID put up a sign saying that since all their food are freshly made, there's usually a 10-20 minutes wait for your food. and IT'S TRUE! lol, their honesty made me giggled. i waited for about 25 minutes for my food haha, i cannot complain because they DID warned me and I decided to stay.. haha.  food 3.5/5: It's not bad, but i've had better. we ordered a spring roll, beef ball pho and one of their combination broken rice dish. Everything is very decent tasting, nothing too bad; I admit i was a bit disappointed since i waited for 25 minutes for this \"freshly made\" food.  Service 3/5: Overall is good; perhaps there's a bit short staffs? I only saw one waiter out at the dinning area helping about 12 tables of customers. So their service may not as promptly as it could be.   Im a very impatient person, i WOULD'VE CAME BACK if the waiting time is not that long. but yeah, i just cant stand the wait, i'd rather go pho king long.",

Naturally, I came in for those specific dishes, plus a bowl of their namesake pho and a Vietnamese iced coffee.  The good news is that the two dishes above are awesome. Rolls (#1, $5.50) have a great mix of meaty pork patty plus crunchy fried onion and fresh lettuce for a medley of flavors and textures. Bun Rieu (#79, $9) is a crab and tomato soup (with plentiful portions of both!), plus noodles, fried tofu pieces, and cilantro and fried onion for garnish. It is so dang good, hearty but not heavy, my new go-to dish here.. and I'll be on the lookout for it elsewhere now, too.  But they're primarily a pho restaurant, and the #70 we ordered (their basic house specialty?) was pretty plain with a light broth that needed the extra condiments and fresh herbs. Soup portions are enormous, with huge bowls of broth and more meat and noodles than many other places. Regulars seem to find very specific dishes to get here rather than recommending everything offered.   TIPS: Closed Mon and Tues, $25 card minimum (dang!), and no split checks. Despite those inconveniences and the sketchy location, I will keep coming back.",

If eating in large parties with many order, be sure to double check the bill carefully before you pay.  2. The price of any bowl of Pho in the menu is less or equal to $8.99. They advertised a chef's oxtail pho on a piece of paper without its price and later charged $17.99 a bowl. When we asked where the price was, the manager said Oxtail pho was a new dish so the menu had not been updated. WHAT A LIE! I later read a few reviews and noticed that oxtail Pho has been sold for at least 10 months! The manager PURPOSELY did not put it in the menu and even BLAMED US FOR NOT ASKING FOR THE PRICE! He said that the original price was $25 (but he keeps the price secretly) and he did make a BIG discount for $17.99. Are you kidding me? Who wanna pay $25 for a bowl of Pho with only 2 small pieces of oxtail?  Pho broth is terrible, salty, and contains lots of MSG.",

We complained about the price, but they blamed us for not asking for the price.  The receipt is also confusing with no detailed items. They also tried charge us an incorrect amount on the spring rolls.  I think they dont care much about their customers because we are mostly visitors. But next time I should check reviews like this to avoid such restaurants. And I dont think their business can last long.",

The broth is flavorful enough to use no or minimal hoisin/sirarcha.  The noodles were fresh.  Add some basil and bean sprouts and dig in.  If you're not feeling pho, the bun rieu is a good alternative.    The crab tomato broth is awesome.  Perfect amount of flavor.",

Generous portion, nice flavors and a lot of steak in the pho which was nice and the meat was tender. A lot of places skimp on the steak.  My only critique (otherwise it would've been 5 stars) would be I needed more lime. I am a big fan of the flavor of lime in my soup and I only got one slice which just wasn't enough.

So i was on a bit of a time crunch so i decided to call ahead for a togo order . Was inform it would be ready in 15-20 just enough time for it to be ready when i arrive. But unfortunately when i came. The order got mix up and wasnt put in. As i stood waiting . Mo must have realize how much of a rush i was in. So he very professionally came to me. Said he would take care of my meal and continues to apologize for the mix up.....now that is what i call customer service. Especially for a vietnamese resturant where most ive been to ,the service have been lack lust at best . To think about it. This was not the first time ive recieve such amazing service here. I order for take out a lot. And sometime i would order for others as well. Come to think of it. Everytime when i have a lot to carry to the car. Mo would gladly even during busy hour. Help me take my food out to the car. I can see why he is so close to a lot of the customers that comes through. Overall the staff here is wonderful whether you are dinning in. Or just taking out. They treat you the way you should. And they would be recieving my business for many and more visits. The food is amazing . And its the only place i would go to get my com tam fix. Portion is great for the price. And above all the staff is wonderful.",

The bun bo hue on the other hand is to die for. The meat is so tender and juicy I could eat it for days.  However the only thing I wasnt very high on was the shrimp cakes. I'd heard they were good and they tasted fine but waaay too greasy. This place definately gets two thumbs up from this  foodie :D",

It was packed at 2pm on a Monday...we had the pork sausage spring roll. It blew us away in both flavor and texture.  The spicy beef soup was beyond delicious.  Well balanced, rich and hearty. The pork blood added a creamy texture and the tendons were tender and flavorful.    I will definitely be back!!!",

The restaurant is hidden in an plaza and hard to spot from the street. It's about $10 cab ride from the strip.   When my friends and I came in, the restaurant is dainty and probably would fit a maximum of 30-40 people. We were seated in the back of the restaurant.   My friends ordered Pho and I ordered Bun Bo Hue (my all time fave). The service was a little slow, but worth the wait when Bun Bo Hue was served to me. The broth was to die for!! One of my friends tasted my broth before she received her Pho and she also agreed that it was delicious. She felt distaste after tasting the broth, her Pho seemed mediocre.   This place also had a check-in deal for Che (three colored drink, $2.99), which was also delicious!  I will definitely come back!",

It even comes with a similar sauce.    The spring rolls great proportion comes with 5 rolls and lettuce, pickles and mint complimented the rolls. It usually doesn't come with all the extra stuff but was a great touch.   Friend of mine got the Bun Rieu the crab tomato seafood soup which was great.  He was American and it was his first time having it and he loved it so that says a lot for someone who doesn't traditional eat Vietnamese food.    Overall great experience will be back!",

    "text": "Do not waste your time and money here. I am all for supporting local businesses, but local businesses are supposed to care about their patrons unlike big chains, right??   The short lady did not look happy to see us upon our arrival; whatever. We sat down and were given two minutes to decide what to order. That's fine; we aren't new to Vietnamese foods; we knew what we want.   I ordered the pho tai with meat on the side. My companions ordered the bun bo hue and the bun huen. One of my companions wanted their sprouts cooked and there was a slight language barrier because the short lady can barely speak understandable English; that's fine. That's how you know it's authentic, right?   I checked in with yelp and was offered the $2.99 three color drink. I asked my companion if they wanted the same, and the lady, I kid you not, scowled that it's for one person only! Ok, ok...   My pho tai arrived after about five minutes, with the meat on the side. Then my companion got theirs. I knew right away it was gonna be less bang for my buck. It was a big bowl of soup and very little noodle. The beef was not the best cut. The broth was nothing special; I really don't know what is so special about this place.   My companions agreed their portions are significantly smaller than other restaurants and their prices are significantly higher.   As we were presented the check, we noticed a $1 charge. We asked the lady what it was for and she said it was for the extra dish bc the pho tai was requested with the meat on the side. WHAT??!  I told her nowhere on the menu did it mention the surcharge and she said nothing about it when I ordered.   I am not cheap but she could at least be a little nicer and explain the surcharge without scowling at us again! And I know it's not because of the language barrier. I have communicated with Thai in Thailand who spoke absolutely no English and I can tell their nicety through facial expressions and gestures.   Overall, the food was sub par. The service is beyond terrible and the prices are too high for what it's worth. I will never recommend this restaurant and actually hope to steer my friends and fellow yelpers away from this place.   And if you do go, don't expect too much.",

I read the mixed reviews for the Bun Bo Hue and wanted to give it a try.  First we ordered the pork spring rolls and I must say they make a very good, fresh spring roll! The pork meat was warm and they give a house sauce that was different, but good- we just added some spice to it. My husband ordered the pho and it was flavorful and good. Now to the Bun Bo Hue, it was not impressive or flavorful. The meat was plentiful and good, but the broth was the opposite- bland & mediocre. The service was very friendly & cashier made me laugh!",

    "text": "After a long night of drinking and lack of sleep, pho would be the ideal food to turn to. I checked on yelp and this place had the best ratings, so we decided to check this place out. Pho Bosa is in chinatown, so a taxi ride is required. Make sure you get the taxi companies number so you can get a ride back because flagging down a taxi is quite difficult in the area. It's a fairly small location, so if you have a big party, be prepared.  Luckily we didn't have to wait. They have a huge selection for you, whether it's pho or rice plates, as well as a lot of different drinks. I always go for the coconut juice since it's helps a lot after a long night. You get the drink in a REAL coconut, and you can eat the insides when you're done. The first time, I ordered the BBH (Bun Bo Hue), it was alright. It taste a little different from what I'm use to but overall it tasted good. You get pork blood and the knuckle along with everyone else that's suppose to be in BBH. Other time, I got the pho dac biet, combination pho. The large is fairly small for a large, but it was a decent serving size considering I couldn't really devour anything. I've definitely had better pho..  Overall this is a decent place. Maybe next time I'll try some of the rice plates because they look delicious.",

    "text": "4 stars on yelp but did they buy these reviews or what?  I came here with my girls for a bowl of yummy noodles, or at least I thought that's what I was coming here for. Sigh another one of the few times that yelp has failed me.. TERRIBLY. I want to tell you that it pains me to write this review.  I hate leaving bad reviews for little hole in the wall Asian places, but damn the food here was REALLY really bad.. I should have known a 4 star Vietnamese place would have really been a unicorn (they don't exist).  Most 3.5 star Vietnamese places have BOMB ass good food, and its just the service that sucks. But when you want a fast noodle fix, who cares about service? I don't! Give me a good hot bowl of soup and i'm happy as a clam.  The service was decent, and they were kind enough to let us know a table for our party of 7 would be a few minutes. But They also charged us for gratuity for a party of 7 without letting us know first. You don't even have your own bathroom inside the restaurant, we need to walk outside to use the community bathroom and the door is so ghetto my girlfriend got stuck inside because you need to lift the door to escape that dungeon of a bathroom. Even McDonald's has their own bathrooms inside the restaurant, and they sure don't charge gratuity. Mcdonalds over Pho Bosa? Just something to think about.   We ordered the pork egg rolls, shrimp rolls and nem rolls. All three appetizers were eh, nem rolls were pretty disappointing but still edible.. on yelp people were ranting and raving about the Bun Bo Hue and the \"home made\" hotsauce so 5/7 of us ordered the Bun Bo hue, One ordered the Bun Rieu, and One Vermicelli noodles.  When the noodles came I was pretty excited. It looked like it had flavor and it would taste good. First sip without adding any sauce. The broth was DISGUSTING!!!! The red color that would give the appearance of flavor and depth in the broth was a SCAM. The red color was achieved by using a CHEATING method. The soup tasted like PAPRIKA and had an under cooked tomato paste sour tangy taste !!! The authentic soup base does not even call for Paprika, OR Tomato paste . Your cooks decided to cut the corners instead of cooking the anatto seed down with oil and shallots and garlic to extract the color and flavors. You want to question me? I cook everything home made, so I sure do know what its supposed to taste like and the actual ingredients in Bun Bo Hue. I sipped one sip of my friends Bun Rieu and same thing, lacking flavor and depth but at least that one was edible. The soup looked so grey and colorless, again, did someone forget anatto seeds? Flavorless soup would have given you no review at all, but when your soup tastes like dry powder, no depth and was so gross, I left the entire bowl there after 3 bites, you have a serious problem on your hands. I DO NOT WASTE FOOD PERIOD.   \"home made\" hot sauce? HA that's another joke. Bun Bo Hue is supposed to be served with Lemon grass hot sauce , and also have lemon grass in the broth. There was no lemongrass flavor to be found anywhere. Yes I make my own hot sauces at home as well.  Mam ruoc (shrimp paste) was also just room temperature and sitting out on the table. It was stinky as it should be, but the stank came more from it being spoiled and left out too long  Fish sauce - very watered down, no flavor, wheres the garlic and chili peppers that should have been infused with it?  We were winding down our weekend in Vegas, and we didn't want to bother or wait for replacement food. The bill came up to $139, $20 per person including 15% gratuity. Not worth the precious real estate in my tummy, or even a penny.  I never NEVER thought I would say this, but I would rather eat at Pho Kim Long than here. And that place is pretty garbage too lol. The #1 worst viet food in LV goes to Pho Bosa!  Congratulations!  Kinh Do is my favorite for pho/ noodles in LV right now.",

She got the crab pho, I went with the usual beef everything.  Got an order of their pork spring rolls as well.  Everything was excellent.  The food came out fast, the guy working the front counter/waiting did an excellent job, keeping us topped up on drinks and just providing extremely friendly service.  He even gave us some samples of their \"world's best coffee\", both of which my sister drank and pronounced as pretty good.  I'll definitely be back again.",

Even if I added fish sauce, sriracha, hoisin, it just didn't spice up the flavor. $9 for a large bowl and that is the ONLY size they have. Like really, there is no other options... I mean I understand that there is people who is hung over and need pho to be revived but having a medium bowl as an option would be nice. Customer service here is really rude. It took them 15 minutes to take our orders when there was nobody in the restaurant except for a group of 4 that already had their food served to them. I ordered the pho with rare steak, tendon and brisket, I hate eating my rare steak cook so I usually get it on the side. I asked the server who seemed to be the owner if I can get my rare steak on the side, she said $1 extra. I was like wth, a dollar extra for less work of you throwing the rare steak that already came with the bowl to put it on the side? how friggin ridiculous right? I would never come back to this pho shop. Seriously, the 4 stars on yelp is half ass and bullshit.",

(i think)... than other pho places i've been to but it was still very good.  got an iced coffee as well, but it was smaller than i expected.  usually i think places give 16 oz, but this looked like 10 oz. still good though.  location is kinda in the middle of nowhere, but i'm guessing most people don't have trouble finding it.  i took the 203 bus from the strip on sands/spring mountain rd and the place is right after your cross over the bridge (rt 15).  pull to request the stop right after you cross over as you could miss the stop (right after the adult superstore) and then the bus doesn't stop until valley view, which requires you to walk back a little bit.",

    "text": "I don't understand why we didn't make this our first stop when we drove into Vegas.  Pulling into the place, it really does not look like it's a restaurant and it's surprising it's still around.  But when you walk in, rest assured that this is the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in Vegas.  We had our first Vietnamese meal in one of the hotels on the strip and were sorely disappointed (I'll review their butts later when I remember what it was called).  The Vegas hotel/casino had Filipino fish sauce, unmixed, for the pork chop.  The pork chop was poorly seasoned, and the bean sprouts were BROWN.  WTF.    But Bosa, omG.  Having driven 10 hours from San Jose, CA to get here, it was a blessing to have it before we went back onto the road to come back.  The food here is as authentic as the Bay Area if not better.  We had pho, bun rieu, and com suon.  The smell, texture, everything was right.  I was jumping for joy because the mints and bean sprouts were FRESH, CRISP.  And we sat there thinking, where the hell do you grow this kind of thing in the middle of a desert?  Beautifully hefty portions of top round, tendon, beef stomach, *drool ....* And they had all the mints - all of them!  Where do you get that here?????  Service is fast, it comes out piping hot, and the coffee is Vietnamese style to the last drop.  And even in Vegas, this place is cheaper than some places in the Bay Area, gladly takes credit card (most hardcore Asian places here don't).  3 of us plus coffee was like $30 after tip - BEAUTIFUL.  Next time we go, we're going here first.  We're picky because we are spoiled from having easy access to good Vietnamese food here.    I saw a couple of negative reviews about this place - you guys are smoking crack.  This place is authentic, really.  This is coming from a guy who eats in Little Saigon in the Bay and in SoCal.",

    "text": "So I'm basically ridiculous and decided to walk here from the Strip even though Las Vegas is NOT a walking city. This involved a weird detour-ladden walk (~2.5 miles!) that included walking across a highway. It was cold, treacherous, and totally worth it.   But take my advice: don't walk. Just take a cab. Seriously. Unless you're also ridiculous, in which case, hi!! :) :) :)  The service was awesome, though I think our waiter isn't one of the full-time ones. He asked if we had been there before, and when we told him we hadn't, he explained all the dishes to us and gave us his recommendations!  We got the #11 broken rice combo with grilled pork, which was absolutely delicious. I haven't had \"shrimp cake\" before, but it was oh-so-good in all the right ways.  We also got the Bun Bo Hue, which was very flavorful and delicious. (I did my research and tried this at another restaurant before posting this review, and while the other restaurant's food was yummy, the Bun Bo Hue here was the winner!) The waiter described this to us as \"spicy soup\".  Bun Rieu was also very good (waiter just called this \"crab soup\").  [[The waiter kept checking on us at this point to ask if we needed a box, since we were a party of 2 and had ordered 3 entrees. We finished them. Cuz we're awesome. I think he was confused.]]  The waitress that was working that night processed our bill on an iPad. We asked about which taxis were good, but I think she got confused because she just left without responding. The waiter that had been helping us came back later to refill our waters and offered to call us a cab when he figured out that we didn't have a car.  Five stars for service and food!",

The first time I feel sort of duped by the Yelp reviews but I guess my bad for not double checking how many reviews there are really and that it's not enough for a good statistics, but we tried, and we failed.   Bf and I go to San Gabriel a lot and their Viet food and selection are not bad, and Westminster area definitely is better every time we go. But I really can't see how this place is 5 stars, the only thing could be there's just not much Pho restaurants nearby to begin with and so there is not much to compare?  This place has got some bad service, rude. Seating you down and doesnt take your order for another 10 minutes. After ordering food took over 30 minutes to come out. And you know what is the most infuriating part? People that came in after us and ordered the same thing (the most common pho order) got their food first! That is seriously one of my biggest pet peeve. Some of us tried to order for the meat to come on the side instead of in the broth, and the server has the nerve to say they can't do it because their too busy, which obviously must be truth since the food seems like it was coming out in snail pace. I couldn't even enjoy the food I was in such a bad mood. The taste was okay, didn't see what the 5-star hype was about. Oh and in the end while we try to pay the bill, they used the iPad to sign for the credit card transactions and server/ manager was rude/strange? He said. \"You can use any fingers to sign, any at all. Just no nails\". Last I know from anatomy class, finger does not equal nail. What?!  As I re-read this, it sounds so harsh compared to the other glowing reviews. But I always call it for what it's worth, and it's not worth 5 stars at all. :(",

This is how I feel about Pho Bosa in comparison to my other Pho spot in town.  I am a huge fan of their peanut sauce that they make and serve warm with their fresh spring rolls. They offer both pork and chicken sausage and the flavor in the sausage is mild. But that dipping sauce makes up for any flavor lost.  The pho here is decent, good, and solid. My noodles were a bit soft in my bowl. And if you have read my other pho reviews, you know that I keep an eye out for any silver or green tinge of coloring on my meats and I didn't see any until my last few pieces of meat. And one piece had a really funky taste to it, which I spit out immediately but other than this - I liked their pho.  The bun bo hue is a winner for me here too. I asked for extra spicy and was delivered just that. The ingredients were fresh and good. The meat however was too big in portion and it would have been a better experience for me if it had been sliced smaller.  The one downfall for me about this place is their bathroom. I do not like that I have to walk outside to use a bathroom.",

I had couple of dishes.  Short ribs and broken rice. Grilled chicken with broken rice. Bun bo hue.  Egg rolls (surprisingly and luckily they were chicken egg rolls).  Every dish was spot on!  Tasty, lots of flavors, meat was marinated really well, friendly staff. Great spot!  Don't judge it by the sign outside, just go inside at enjoy a great viet meal.   Trust me. I know food.",

The tofu roll comes with dipping sauces on the side (either a soy type sauce or peanut sauce; I got both), and it is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten, and is going to be the thing I will come back to Pho Bosa for. The pho was standard but still very good.  I also really like that they have a bottle of that Vietnamese fish sauce on every table.   Overall, very good Vietnamese food, and I highly recommend!",

Which is fine. But not many restaurants deny that. But as we ate our pho he got really busy so we understood why he wanted the larger tables available.  The taste of the pho was great. They put a lot of meat and the soup was hot (just the way I like it)  I believe they don't have different pho sizes but what I had was big. Comparing it to other places I've been, it's like a \"large\" bowl. Good pricing.  The sauce for the pot stickers was amazing.   We felt like our server/cashier was rushing us to leave. My boyfriend and cousin got done eating before myself and my other cousin. She kept coming by to ask us if we were done. I ate quickly cause I figured maybe they have others waiting for a table. As we walked out, there were still plenty of open tables left. I'm not sure why she was in a hurry to finish us up.",

The pho broth is so flavorful and clean, and the meats are so nice and tender. The Bun Rieu is really good too, and they make sure to give you a plentiful amount of crab/shrimp meat.  Last and most favoriteeeeee part of this place is their Nem Nuong Cuon. Best I've ever had. The pork is so flavorful and fresh, and the fried egg roll wrapper has the perfect crunch. So yummy!!",

Hands down. He made us feel so welcome and accommodated our every need. Oh and he had all the PHO-nny puns ;)  sweet guy.  The vegetarian egg rolls are VEGAN! Apparently there's no egg, so that was pleasantly surprising. They were delicious and I'd definitely order them again.   I got the vegetarian pho and my boyfriend got something with lots of meat and blood and stuff... I LOVED mine! It had a very flavorful broth, lots of veggies and tofu! Yum! Mo also gave us some garlic and Thai chili to add for flavor and boy that made the flavor stand out.   My boyfriend on the other hand didn't like his food at all. I think it was the blood that threw him off. Boyfriend actually thought mine was much better after tasting it and will get what I ordered the next time we come here.   Everything about my experience here was great and I would definitely come back for more VEGAN PHO!",

Firstly, when you walk in the ambiance is very pleasant. I love the layout, it's a nice size, and not overly crowded. Next, our server had a personality. He was funny and it was nice to have a male asian server with a sense of humor. I ordered Pho soup with brisket and meatballs and a Thai Tea with boba. The quality of noodles and meat were outstanding and the meat cooked perfectly. Most importantly it was delicious! At the end of our meals, we had a hard time and inquired about it being difficult placing our Pho in to go containers. It would have been nice if our server knowing this would have helped as we made a mess. Also, the option to split checks would be nice. Overall, we had a pleasant experience and will definitely be back. If you're looking for some tasty Pho please try Pho Bosa!",

Their new location feels comfortable and makes it easy if you're eating alone--The place is spacious and has TV.  Ordered #71 the steak + beef ball (so glad they have that combo) and everything was great.  The broth wasn't too greasy, portions were enough and it was made fresh.   Pho is always my go-to hangover cure and I think I found my new favorite place to make it. Whenever I'm craving Pho, the drive would be worth it.",

There are food items with pictures so friendly for those that do not regularly eat vietnamese food. Ordered the raw beef pho, But don't fret it's not really raw because the soup broth is so hot and the beef slices are so thin that it instantly cooks. The bowls were very generously sized and the broth was good it's a little bit on the sweeter side though. I thought the pho was average,meat was typical and broth was average tasting. They are very clean though, so that's a plus. Also had some spring rolls to sample, their spring rolls tasted very good and fresh. I thought this restaurant was ok but didn't have anything that stood out from the rest. Prices are on par with other casual restaurants dishes start at around 10/12 dollars",

The restaurant is located in a plaza with other businesses so there are plenty of parking. The restaurant is average sized and we didn't have to wait to get seated (which is awesome!)   I had their spring rolls, Bun Rieu, and their sugar cane drink and everything really hit the spot. The Bun Rieu broth was really flavorful, and they didn't skimp out on the portion. Spring roll was super fresh and a serving was enough for four people to share as an appetizer. I rarely see the sugar cane drinks at a Vietnamese restaurant these days, so it was perfect for my after meal drink. It was really refreshing and not too sweet. I will definitely be going back when I'm back in Vegas!",

I got the Pho Dac Biet (meatballs, rare beef slices, brisket, and tendon) they only have two types of meat. It came with a lot of meat but the meat (it was suppose to be brisket I think) had a lot of fat on it and the texture to the meat was not chewy, the meatball was softer. I don't know what happened to my meat in my bowl pho but it was not good at all but the broth was good though. They don't have egg noodles either and it's only one size for all their pho bowls.",

The taste was so delicious and mouthwatering, even writing this review and looking at the photo is making my taste buds wanting more! By far, this Vietnamese restaurant has the BEST rice dishes! The flavor of the grilled pork has lots of flavors especially the shrimp cake and egg quiche. It tasted so fresh and rich in flavors! They gave lots of portion. I was even able to finish my dish!  The staff here are nice and wanting to make sure their food satisfy their customers. Also, the service here was good.  I RECOMMEND TO COME EAT HERE!

The broth was soothing and calmed my need to vomit slash the throbbing in my head. But the husband and his more informed palette reports the broth was on the sweet side.

Taking the most flavorful Pho broth and trying to better something that \"isn't broken,\" I'm glad to say that the \"smokey broth\" options here have ruined my desire to eat \"plain\" pho ever again lol.  They have a few variants, but the Smoked Oxtail Pho is highly recommended!  Literal smoked broth, highly peppery with just the right amount of oil!  The Oxtail itself full of flavor, well peppered and tender.  The cartilage and fat rendered to remind one of a glorious bone marrow, highly edible and decadent.  Such a diverse dish with layers of depth in each bite.  Easily the best Oxtail AND Pho I've had thus far :)  And now they've expanded the menu once again, to include my go-to choice for sandwiches, the Banh Mi Thit Nuong / Charbroiled Pork Sandwich.  Excellent bread, airy and buttery soft, with a garlicky aioli spread and the best charbroiled pork in town!  Now with the new menu options, I have no excuse to eat Vietnamese food anywhere else in town lol   If you haven't tried Bosa yet, you're in for a treat.  Just don't be surprised if the \"smokey pho\" lives up to the hype ;)",

    "text": "WOW! After a LONG bachelorette weekend in Vegas, my friend and I needed to feed our body something HEARTY and to cure our hangover! We immediately hopped on YELP, and saw Pho Bosa. We took a 10 minute Uber and this restaurant did NOT disappoint. We ordered the pork spring rolls and shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer. That was probably the BEST shrimp egg rolls we have ever eaten. We also both got an order of pho. The broth was SO flavorful and tasted HOMEMADE. I am so sad there is not a place as good as Pho Bosa in Dallas. If you need some authentic Vietnamese food, GO HERE. WE WILL definitely BE BACK!!",

Also their spring rolls had this yummy sausage with a crunch. Very unique and amazing. P.S. if you're looking for a good panini definitely try this place. I had the Boso special.

The crab is non existent. The blend of meat is just pork and egg and the tofu in the soup is not good.  Bun Bo Hue - the soup was average and the noodles were perfect. The meat is a bit tough and the pork blood is not the best, but it'll satisfy your cravings.  Pho Dac Biet - my family had this and they they could taste a lot of the MSG. They said they gave a good amount of meat.   Overall, bowls were a good size but a very average place. They also accept credit card.    Note: all bowls are large and they do charge a 15% service charge AFTER tax for parties of 5 or more.",

I believe had a Pho spot but they were charging like $14-$17 a bowl! hahaha! I am from the Washington DC area, no one pays $17 for some noodles and broth! We found this place!! Pho Basa. Somewhat off the \"tourist section\" of Vegas and let me tell you! It was BUSY!! We had to wait like 15 minutes to get a seat. That shows that this place get business.   They finally seated us for a table for four people and they gave us the menu. The bowls were like $8.50 for the large and $7.50 for a small and the portions are large! The broth was so tasty! The sprouts and leaves were fresh and not wilted. They have wooden disposable chopsticks that made it easy to eat with.   They had one bathroom for each gender and it was clean.   They do not split checks so be prepared for that. And the first guy said that they couldn't take credit cards, which was weird but it was an error on their end of things but we managed to pay and leave after 15 minutes of issues. This experience was the only downfall. But other than that? This place is what sparked my Pho drive back. I went to one place 5 years ago and it was NASTY lol ever since then never went to a PHO place ever again. This made me start going again in Maryland. haha! Good sneaky Pho restaurant in VEGAS.",

Pho Bosa popped up and we were sold... They have VEGAN EGG ROLLS!!! LAAAAWD HAVE MERCY I haven't had an egg roll in FOREVER! Most pho places do offer veggie pho nowadays WITH veggie broth! But this is the first place I've been to that have vegan egg rolls on the menu! And I love them! They're served with the traditional lettuce, pickled veggies, cilantro and rice noodles with their house made sauce. FUCKING YUM. I'm also a huge fan of their tofu spring rolls. They have some crispy crunchies inside the spring roll along with fried tofu and I love the texture it gives the rolls. FUCKING YUM, AGAIN! The first time we ate here the veggie broth was SUPER on point. I loved it. The following times we have dined here, the broth wasn't quite as flavorful, a little plain actually, but has lots of veggies, bok choy, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and fried tofu. Of course I'd continue coming back here just to get my egg roll and spring roll fix tho. They also have sugar cane juices of you're into that.",

However, the food is mostly delicious.   PHO The bowls of pho are huge and well flavored. Though $9 a bowl, there's more than enough meat to make up for the price. I counted 6-7 pieces of tendon on top of 10-12 slices of rare beef. The first day we came, we ordered 1 bowl each. We died. Too much food. The second time we ordered two to a bowl and we were more than stuffed.   Spring Rolls The pork spring rolls were hot and fresh when we ordered it. The pork wasn't as well flavored as it could've been. The spring roll itself is comparable to brodards. However, the dipping sauce is comparable to summer rolls in Rosemead (bomb).   Drinks The coconut was fresh, cold, and delicious. The Vietnamese coffee was a bit disappointing. It tasted like powdered.   Overall: I will definitely be back.

All of us got the combination (#70). It only came in one size, but the bowl was pretty big and well worth the $8.50 for it. I couldn't finish mine but my dad and brother managed to finish theirs. The plate of herbs had more than enough bean sprouts on it which was awesome and had the usual limes and jalepenos on the side. However, the only herb on it was Thai basil. Would've been nice to have culantro/mint/cilantro as well.  The broth was delicious and steaming hot. I thought it was a little salty but the bean sprouts and the noodles balanced it out. There was no tripe which was sad but even so there was a ton of meat. Overall everything was delicious!!",

It had pork knuckle, corned beef, pork, and a variety of gelatinous meat but it lacked depth and flavor. I should have stuck to Pho.

    "text": "I wanted to try some place new besides Viet Noodle Bar which is my go to for bun bo hue. Did a quick search for bun bo hue and Pho Bosa popped up with great reviews. Did a quick skim and a lot of people did recommend it.  Its pretty close to chinatown with a large lot. I came around 3:30 with a gf and we both ordered the Bun Bo Hue. The server asked us how spicy we wanted it and I got mild while my friend got spicy. It came out fairly quickly, in a huge bowl and accompanied by a large plate of fresh veggies. As soon as I tasted the broth I was disappointed. It was definitely lacking flavor. Maybe I came in on an off day or something but the bun bo hue at Viet Noodle Bar is 100x's better and its consistent too. Lots of meat but its really tough and the cuts are super thick. Another reviewer mentioned that the pork blood had a weird taste to it, and I thought so too.   Food was meh but service was really good. I might be back to try their bun rieu since I\"m down the street, but we'll see!",

It wasn't until later that they started serving pho due to popular demand. This was my first time eating here and I was in the mood for pho, so I ordered their pho dac biet and their pork Spring rolls. Both were pretty dang good for this hungry guy and if pho isn't their specialty, you can bet that I'll be back next time to try one of their broken rice dishes!  Service: Service was pretty good. I was seated right away. Even with a huge party of about 20 people and smaller groups already there when I got there, I never did once felt neglected by the waitstaff.  Location: It is located in a not so nice area of Vegas. There's nothing aesthetically pleasing about the place. It's not quite located in the thriving Chinatown just further West down the road on Spring Mountain. You'll have to turn onto Polaris Ave to get into the parking lot. Inside the restaurant can get pretty warm. They currently do not have working air conditioning, but they do have several huge fans running to help with the heat. It's actually tolerable if you happen to be eating a hot bowl of pho.",

Location was a little tough for our Uber to find and nothing special inside, but was clean and staff friendly. We also got the whole fresh coconut which was refreshing after the Vegas sun and tasted like dessert! Loved it. Will be back!

    "text": "My group came here after a long weekend in Vegas. The place was quite empty when we got there, but it eventually got busier. My friends got the beef pho and I got the chicken. They did not have many options for beef, i only recall seeing rare fillet, beef balls, and a couple more items. For the chicken pho, they only give chicken breast, no dark meat.  Both of the broths were very well seasoned, but lacking in spices overall. They almost just tasted like beef noodle soup and chicken noodle soup instead of the traditional pho flavors.   Also, they added fried garlic in my chicken pho, which changes the flavor greatly. I believe that pho should not contain garlic because the star ingredients are the spices like cloves and star anise etc.   Their pho bowls only come in size large, so do consider sharing if you are a small eater. We were the first and only table when we placed the order, but the food took about 15 minutes to arrive.  We had a group of 9 people, which incurs a 15% service fee in the check. I don't recall seeing this note on the menu, but I was running low on energy so perhaps i might have missed it. They also won't split the check, but will take cards for payment, which is great.   Parking is plenty. And the restaurant was very clean. The staff were also very nice and friendly.",

From the outside to the inside, place looks boring, it honestly looks like the old ass restaurants you see on Restaurant: Impossible, where Robert Irvine has to pretty much go in there and tear it apart. So yes the restaurant looks boring, and yes it is the definition of a hole in the wall, so I'd assume the food was going to be great..but the pho was just pretty decent; I ordered the pho tai bo vien which comes with rare steak and beef balls. I like that the beef balls weren't tiny and that this place actually give quite a few, and the rare steak was actually rare steak. The broth was so so, wasn't superb, and wasn't shit, just ok. Orders come out slow, but they tell you that on a sign saying something about freshness and made to order.....then again, pho broth does take more than 20 mins to make and everything else; noodles, meat, veggies are all add ins so freshness is very vague lol.",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER! I've only had to walk-out of a restaurant twice in my adulthood and this was one place I'll never forget.   It's a given! Pho is a great hangover remedy, my friends and I visited pho bosa cause per Yelp, it was new and had great ratings. We had a large party and was immediately greeted by:  \"You guys CANT sit together at one table but I still have to charge you the gratuity\"  I was already agitated by their welcoming greeting, and after I politely asked why, the waiter forced me to speak to the owner, I'm fine with that. However, the owner was the one who went overboard.   He exclaimed his frustration about my disagreement to pay the group gratuity even though we sat separately. Usually when you have big groups, you want them on separate checks to speed up the service. The disgruntled owner had the balls to say: \"You don't want to seem like an asshole to your friends to get your food first and have them wait for a 'long' time, would you?\"  I couldnt believe how unprofessional and unamicable the owner was. He tried explaining a bunch of other useless chatter, but I just decided to take the business to another pho restaurant down the street.  I can't understand why the owner pushes a gratuity charge on large parties when this place IS NOT BIG ENOUGH to seat parties of 4 or more!!!   Pho Bosa didn't have much of a crowd there and its built in a sketchy industrial area, probably isn't safe there anyway. We also chose this place cause we wanted to give them some business. I'm a firm supporter of small business owners as I am one myself.  But I guess this was decided otherwise.   One thing I also found really bizarre was that the owner was non-Asian, I don't know, but I think Asian owned pho joints will taste much better. LOL. Just and observation. By the way, most of the other reviews on here are bogus.",

    "text": "Pho Bosa is definitely a local treasure when it comes to home-style Vietnamese grub.  I reviewed this humble eatery based on the merits of their Bun Bo Hue back in their old location (Bosa 1) and since their move have had the opportunity to sample additional selections including Bun Rieu and their broken rice plates, and have never been disappointed.    Bun Bo Hue- rustic and spicy lemongrass beef broth with chewy round bucatini-like rice noodles and a complex assortment of flavors and textures from the plethora of meat components (beef shank, pork knuckle, beef tendon, ginger infused pork blood cake) topped with an array of crunchy shredded cabbage and fresh herbs), no mouthful is the same from start to finish.  Definitely the best rendition in town.     Bun Rieu- an umami tsunami of chicken broth with thin rice vermicelli, fried tofu, fresh tomato, and a mixture of crabmeat /egg topped with crispy shallots, green onion.  Served piping hot, this is an optimal winter dish with a lot of minimally \"masticatory\" (for lack of a better made-up word) components meant to be swirled together on the tongue with interplay of sweet, savory, and even floral (there is some mystery herb in this soup that is reminiscent of shiso leaf).  Broken rice plates- It may sound like the aftermath of a Greek wedding, but these are the Vietnamese cousins of the American meat and 3 sides.  The rice are fractured grains broken during the cleaning/harvesting of the rice, originally considered peasant food, but now having a wave of popularity due to its unique texture and flavor evoking the nuttiness of basmati and the butteriness of arborio in a solid risotto.   Accompanying the rice is a savory shrimp cake wrapped in impossibly crispy tofu skin, a delicate egg quiche, shredded pork loin, some pickled veggies and your protein of choice (I recommend the Korean beef short ribs or the grilled pork chop).  Drizzle all the above with their fish sauce made in house, and you will not want to stop eating until the last grain of rice is scooped off the plate.    Don't forget to partake in the free fountain drink with checking in on Yelp and credit cards are accepted!",

We came around 2:30pm and had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table for 2. The restaurant is tight, stuffy, and busy. The service is really good though. Our food came out quickly. The man who seated us and brought our waters was very friendly and jolly and kept cracking jokes.  Pho was $8-10 per bowl, which is expensive in my opinion, but hey, if you're craving something in Vegas, be prepared to pay for it. My man ordered pho with rare beef and beef balls. I ordered the pho in spicy lemongrass soup with pork, beef brisket, etc. I didn't like the noodles in either dish. The beef pho noodles were stale, dry, and thin. The noodles in my soup were just a cheaper version of udon.  I will say this: the quality of the meat is fantastic here. The brisket fell apart and had the perfect balance of tender meat and flavorful fat. We also ordered the pork sausage spring rolls for our appetizer, which were pretty good (although the best can only be found at Brodard in Garden Grove, CA).  Vietnamese iced coffee here is a MUST. It was rich, sweet, and smoky with a hint of caramel. Jolts you right out of that hangover! if only...",

THE BEST .. they've ever had \"delicious\".  Oddly enough no one in our group ordered the pho, which Pho Bosa takes time and effort to make, rather then have it all already set like majority of the pho restaurants one will go to. Think of them as the Jack in the Box of Pho? Your meal isn't made until ordered.  With that said, wait time is long (if busy). Rather 5-7 minutes, look for 15-20 minutes. May I also add this place is fishy? It's in a complex full of office buildings. And pricing is ridiculously expensive. $2-3 more.",

I ordered the traditional pho tai with extra meat, and my friend ordered the spicy beef soup which I think is called bo bun hue, which everyone after us kept ordering! So it must be awesome! I would recommend getting it not too spivey as you can always add spice to the right heat content! It came out a little too spicy even for my spice loving mouth! Overall the food was really really good and the server was really awesome! From first look this restaurant doesn't look like much but it definitely packs a punch when you go in!

The order comes with five crispy fried vegetable rolls. On the big plate it has large leaf lettuce, cilantro, mint, pickled shredded veg, and sliced cucumber. (I wanted a side of peanut sauce but she said \"oh no that sauce has chicken in it\"....pass :(   We get the vegetarian pho and its is verrrry yummy. It is a surprisingly full flavored broth and the large bowl comes loaded with noodles, broccoli, fried tofu, green onions, and bok choy.  We also sometimes get the Noodle Salad Bowl it comes with your choice of meat so we get the fried tofu. The bowl  has noodles, shredded lettuce, pickled shredded veg, cucumber, dark purple Thai basil, fried tofu, and whole peanuts. I usually add the fresh mint and cilantro to the bowl. Sometimes I ask for a side of the vegetarian sauce and put a little on it.  Between the vegan pho and the vegan noodle salad bowl it's always a hard choice between the two because they are both good!  Their food is fresh and full of flavor. The vegetables are clean and snappy fresh and the service is always quick and pleasant always with a smile.   We will continue to frequent Pho Bosa!!!!!! Yum!",

    "text": "Friends were craving pho so looked up local pho places and this one came up on yelp and was able to convince my friends in trying it out. Went on a Sunday just before noon and the place was packed. It is a tiny spot and they have signs warning it's not a fast food kind of place meaning don't expect in and out quickly, just in case you're in a rush.  We waited for about 25 minutes so you might as well grab a menu and figure out what you want to order, which is what I did and just chatted up with the staff to figure out how it worked. The broken rice and bun section may seem a little confusing but the staff was able to explain it to me.   I believe the owner took our order and we were impressed she was able to remember our appetizers, drinks and entrees without writing it down. I ordered pork spring rolls and egg rolls to share. Their spring rolls are very similar to the Brodards with the sauce but was expecting 4 whole rolls not 2 rolls cut into 4 pieces. They were decent though prefer Brodards since Brodards I feel has more ingredients and there's more rolls. The egg rolls were also decent though I would have preferred more herbs and the egg rolls I've had at other places I feel have more meat (due note my standard is Orange County Vietnamese food so it's a bit biased).     One of my friends got pho, which was huge portion and the other 2 both got different broken rice dishes, which all were big portions and all looked yummy, while I got bun #45, which was also huge and that one comes with grilled pork and egg rolls.  The grilled pork was solid though their style bun seem to have more of a lemon grass flavor to it. Dishes aren't served at the same time and I was the last to receive mines, so the food is hot when you receive so I insisted my friends eat first. Staff was friendly and helpful.",

Pho broth was fine, but the portion was small(noodle and greens are all in small portion), service was below average, and moreover, they charged $1 per onions we ordered which was the first in 24 years(we ordered 5 onions)  we all ended up eating a bowl of pho + extra noodle + extra onion in all extra charge!

A nice welcomed addition to the menu is the Pho. This was available back at the location on S. Jones. So far I have tried the Pho with the Beef Balls, Brisket, and the rare beef. All three have been a hit with me.  The service is always so friendly and accommodating. I am never left wanting when I am there.

My family and I come in with about 8 people and wanted to sit & paid separately. At first one of the employe (lady with the gray hair) said \"sit here together because the other side of the room has no heater and we will count the bill separately\". Later when our food comes out this couple walk in and she seated them in the opposite side (side with apparently no heater.) We then ask to be seated in two different tables because the restaurant was literally empty and they said no & that they will separate the bill. So we ended up sitting in a big table after hearing that the bill will be separated. After they took our order the rude gray hair lady mumble in front of our face and said \"even if you're sitting together or not you're be still paying gratuity\" in such a disrespectful tone. According to the menu a party of five and up they changed gratuity for you but we come in wanting to sit in four. Now I know why the lady in the gray hair put us in a party of eight instead of four liked we asked for. The old woman in the gray hair was so fake and changed her voice every time a new customer walk in. I didn't mine paying the gratuity but the employees there were just so impolite and ill-mannered. After we got our bill they changed for a party of 8 when we clearly asked for 4 and they said yes in the beginning. I don't recommend coming to this place because the horrible service.   Although the service was bad and disappointing, the foods was decent. Not the best Vietnamese food I ever tasted but was still pretty good. But I still wouldn't come back. Worst restaurant ever.....",

    "text": "After spending a few days in Vegas eating casino food, we really needed to have a home cooked - non buffet - meal. So we searched Yelp for suggestions and found Pho Bosa. We were exploring town so it was close to where we were, in the Rio area, found several places but Yelp gave the place a good review so we went in. We were early for dinner but was surprised that it was empty, but they had several people waiting for their to go items.  We were immediately seated, asked if we had any questions, both staff - the owners we found out, were very friendly and made the right recommendations, which we took them up on.   There were four of us so we had a good variety and tasted each other's food. Everything was awesome!! The meat was tender and tasty - had both beef and pork. The rice was flaky, a little sticky, just right. We also had the noodles. Love the fact we can make our own sauce and as much as we wanted. All our dishes had the eggroll. We were going to go for desert but we were too full. The plates were very generous. They were very attentive and friendly. We will definitely come back again the next time we're in town, which is August of this year.  Prices were very reasonable. Let's just say, for the cost of one person's buffet dinner meal, we paid for the entire meal here. And to top it off, we were very satisfied whereas the last two day's worth of meals at the casino were not the greatest. We are definitely keeping this place in mind because I can't eat a week's worth of casino meals especially knowing that just off the strip are home cooked meals.",
