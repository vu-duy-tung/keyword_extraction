I ordered my favorite Vegas breakfast dish which is Steak & Eggs, hash browns, and sourdough toast. The friendly waitress offered us a Cinnamon Roll to start before we received our food, we said YES! After we devoured the roll we received our food. My dish was perfect just the way I like it and my girls loved their food also, they both are picky eaters. The owner came by our table to make sure everything was okay, we happily said yes. If you are in the mood for breakfast skip nasty Denny's or ihop and instead try a mom and pop place like this one, you won't be disappointed.",

The staff here is extremely friendly and make sure you are well taken care of during your visit.    Seems like the majority of costumers here are working class mixed with retirees and definitely regulars to this establishment.  All the decor takes you back to a time definitely not forgetten here from the 1950's telephone to the early 80's Polaroid camera the window booths have vintage conversation starters galore.  The food is delicious and appropriately prices on my first visit I had Curtis' Haystack ( biscuits and gravy topped with hashbrowns eggs and bacon) and it was a full meal for sure so being your best appetite for that one 4.25/5   Today I had the French Toast Special and the French Toast was prepared perfectly a nice buttery flavor and disappeared quickly. 2 eggs over medium and bacon completed the meal. 4.5/5.  So if you are looking for a nice relaxing breakfast /lunch spot with great service and delicious food look no further than Lou's Diner the Diner that time forgot.",

    "text": "Went here for breakfast last week. The food was good nothing to fancy or over the top crazy here. It's a small joint so I wouldn't recommend going with a big party to this dinner maybe 5 or 6 people max. The prices are great, you get some good food for cheap which is a lot better than some of the place around town that charge more but the food is mediocre. In my opinion stay away from the potatoes that are cut up, I believe they call them hash fries, because they were most definitely under season and had a bland taste. Everything else was good I had the breakfast skillet with sausage and bacon, I will be getting it with hash browns next time. The pancakes where great my son was in love he ate all of his plus he had some of mine as well. The staff is friendly and always around when you need them, but not to the point where you can't enjoy your meal. Also take a look around while your there check out this place personality, you just might be amazed.  It is a seat yourself type of place so if you are going I would get there early. They close at 3 seeing as how they only serve breakfast and lunch, with breakfast being all day. Hope you enjoy a good meal here. I would recommend this place to someone who likes small dinners with corky decorations and is a chain restaurant.",

    "text": "Okay, first of all this place gets major props for being in the same spot for at least 30 years.  I am guessing on the amount of years but it is a long time.  Dare I say a \"tradition\" in Las Vegas...  Anywho.  I LOVE this place.  In fact it reminds me of home.  It reminds me of the local diner of yesteryear.  Try sitting in there facing the kitchen so you cannot see Decatur Blvd and you for get you are in Las Vegas!  I felt like I was sitting in a mom and pop joint in Idaho. (that's a good thing BTW).  This place has that mom and pop family restaurant charm to it with out even trying.  It is a real mom and pop joint.     I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs.  The chicken fried steak was out of sight!  It was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was thinner than other chicken fried steaks but it was huge.  They might tenderize real well that makes it wider and thinner, but that is only speculation.  It was smothered with gravy.    The eggs, and I have said this before, a good breakfast joint has to perfectly baste my eggs.  This place served perfectly basted eggs.  Almost... almost... not quite as good as my mom does... almost.  I had the home fries with breakfast.  They were good.  It was just all around good breakfast food.  The portion was huge.  The prices were low.  Great value here!  The service was good. The waitress wasn't exactly warm but she had the diner waitress attitude that is borderline curt but at the same time likably crusty.  Kinda like Tommy Lasorda.  Side notes ** parking is bad - extra parking in the back **  Coffee was weak - next time I come throw an extra scoop in the hopper for me.",

When I saw there was none.  I resigned myself to no coffee when my waiter gave me some of his private stash.  Thanks Bryan.  Went there twice for breakfast.  My toast came with 3 homemade jams, each better than the next.  The haystack was recommended and I'm so glad I listened; potatoes, biscuits, sausage gravy, eggs and bacon on the side.  Tastes a lot better than it sounds. I would definitely go back when in town.",

I've never seen the bottom of my coffee cup and always leave feeling like that was going to be the only meal of the day. The chicken fried steak was huge and topped with some of the best gravy around. I'd put their pancakes up against anyone's in a \"Battle for best breakfast.\" Located on the NE corner of Decatur/Alta, it is well worth the trip from anywhere. If you're looking for a good, hearty, stick to your ribs breakfast, you won't be disappointed. The staff is fast and friendly and doesn't mind if you want to substitute or have a special request. I would highly recommend the \"Hay Stack\" for first time guest. Our crew from work has kind of become regulars here. We are never dissatisfied and we keep coming back.",

I found this place on Yelp and decided to take a very short trip off the strip. This place is truly the best breakfast I have had in all of my trips to Vegas.  I had the Curtis which is a pleather of hash browns then two fluffy biscuits go on top of that. The gravy is poured on top and then two scrambled eggs make this the bomb! The sausage patties on the side are like icing on a cake. This place works hard on making sure you are satisfied and that the food is done right.  And when you think you are done, they have a cinnamon roll that is worthy of being on a page by itself. They mix the cinnamon in into the flour to make it so that the cinnamon doesn't over power you like most when the put it on the outside of the cinnamon roll. The icing is so creamy and has just the right sweetness.  I definitely will be back on my next visit.",

Lou's Diner captures the essence of a home made meal, and enjoying a meal with your family. It's got a really wholesome - like, honestly welcoming and comforting without judgment - WHOLESOME vibe that I really appreciated. It's self-seating but I was really impressed that the waitstaff was really attentive when you did pick a slot to sit at. As straight to the point our waitress is she made extra effort to smile and be really kind. The food - I ordered a veggie omelet - was amazing, the jam for my toast was to die for.

I opted for the skillet breakfast with basted eggs, hash browns and bacon. I ordered my eggs basted and they were perfect (I didn't get that vacuous quizzical look usually found on the faces of young wait staff at newer restaurants as they ask \"What's basted?\" The hash browns and bacon in the skillet were crispy! I love, love, love crispy potatoes and bacon! Then, I was offered an array of home made preserves to go with my toast. I chose strawberry and it did not disappoint. Everyone appeared to enjoy working here and were efficient and kind. If I lived in Vegas this would be my regular breakfast place. Good job, Lou's!",

Anyway, you know that you are in a local spot when 9 out of 10 patrons are locals. Walking in, we were greeted warmly by a waitress. Not the \"thank you for coming to our establishment\" kind of greeting but more like \"Hi hon! Just grab a seat and we'll get right with you!\" with a big smile. The greetings from the other patrons were not so nice. It was more like \"Oh crap! more of these damn tourists!\"   Our food was amazing. I know you really can't screw up breakfast foods but their food was fresh and tasty. The biscuit and gravy was excellent. The corn beef hash was delicious. They also offered a variety of items on their lunch menu, including fresh baked pies.   The reason why we really loved the place was that the owner, Brian, stopped by to talk to us. Not just your usual \"how's everything?\" greeting but he actually stopped and I mean talked to us for a while. I even told us about his family and how they like to spend their vacations. Right is the middle of a busy morning. That's really cool and meant a lot to us. Every restaurant should be like this! It was so good we came back the next day.",

There are a couple of standard flavors and always a new or special flavor.(Today it was apple jam. I could take a dish and eat it with a spoon like applesauce)   There are breakfast, lunch, sandwich, and soup specials every day.  I've never had anything I didn't like.

On this basis, Lou's gets 5 stars.  I am a local resident who has been coming here a couple-few times a year for 15 years. The food is very good and always comes out hot. Special requests are greeted with, \"We'll be happy to do that.\" The service is outstanding and friendly. And... the check is always reasonable.  (Note:  Brian, the new owner, took over from the original owner, Lou, not long ago. As a customer who loves Lou's just the way it was, I was happy to see that Brian didn't change much -- and the things that changed were for the better. Like...  Free Wi-Fi.  :-)",

I opted for breakfast ( which is served all day) and ordered the skillet breakfast. Two eggs, over medium, breakfast potatoes, and bacon. Very tasty.  My son had the crispy fish sandwich and french fries. It looked delicious and he thought it was very good. We both ordered homemade cake to go. Triple chocolate and the last piece of lemon! All in all, the food was just ok. The reason I will be returning is for the exceptional service we received. The employees were very attentive and friendly.

    "text": "I drove past this diner when visiting Pop's last week, and somehow it stuck in my mind enough to suggest it for breakfast this morning. Pulled it up on Yelp and looked through the recommended dishes, then headed out at 7AM, right when they opened.  BF and I sat at the bar and were helped by a sweet older lady. We sat right next to an amazing-looking butter pecan cake, but chose not to try it this visit. I'm slightly regretting it now, since it looked and sounded amazing, but I can't do sugar that early in the morning.  Bar was set with plenty of local papers to browse through, which we did after placing our orders: the chili cheese omelet with a side of homefries (as per so many recommendations here on Yelp!) and the lunch special of the day (available even at bfast hours!) of tuna sandwich and chicken noodle soup.   Service was friendly and attentive without overbearing, which is a careful balance when sitting at the bar anywhere, and food was out quick. Omelet was oozing with melted American cheese, and the homefries were on the plain side but had a good crispiness to them- the side mixed well with the omelet and chili sauce. The tuna sandwich was very basic but nothing to complain about; the soup was downright delicious with noodles that tasted homemade and a broth that was complex and seemed to have been cooked down for a long time.  All the food had a good homecooked taste to it, and it was a nice laid-back morning with my guy and the paper. What more can I ask for that early on a Sunday?",

This kitschy kitchen has all the breakfast staples along with a sizeable lunch menu. But today, like always, it was breakfast for us.  I ordered a hot link with eggs (over hard), home fries, and wheat toast. My husband got his usual order of ham steak and eggs (over easy), hash browns, and sourdough toast. My food was fine -- nothing special -- but my husband raved about his meal.  Our server was great. When we got there, they were slammed, and she made sure to let us know she'd be over as soon as she could. She promptly refilled our drinks and didn't leave us waiting on our bill.  As I said, the decor is decidedly kitschy, with copious cookie jars and coffee mugs throughout. It's not fine dining, but it's one of the finer breakfast joints I've been to in Vegas. If you're into diner food, give Lou's a try.",

Came in for breakfast on a Friday morning and our group was initially set upon by obvious regulars poking in good fun at us.  The waitress was very friendly and explained away whatever question was fired off at her by the group.  For the remainder of our meal she never let the coffee run empty or cold.  We all ordered something that had gravy poured on it.  Not brown gravy but the southern kind that sticks to the ribs.  A field test was conducted and a utensil was inserted into said gravy and then inverted where it seemed to defy gravity by clinging to the implement.  My meal of choice was \"The Haystack.\"  It was a bed of hash browns, eggs, cheese smothered above goodness.  For added stress on the arteries two pieces of bacon were placed on each side.  So filling was the meal, lunch or anything else was not required the rest of the day.",

TIP if you want a fun mug to sip your coffee from rather than the typical diner mug, just ask your waitress when you order your hot beverage! They have specials for each meal and fresh baked desserts everyday. If you come around enough the staff WILL remember you and it's like a little family in there. I typically go after church on Sundays with my Aunt and it can be a little busy but always worth the wait (although there rarely is one).  I love the vibe of not only the staff but the type of customers this diner attracts.",

I changed my order from the skillet to fried eggs and hash browns because I was tired of hard blackened potatoes. They need to find a better short order cook. Final straw was my husband complaining about raw steak and having nothing done about it. They did still charge for the breakfast.

We're talking about all the breakfast basics done INCREDIBLY well and at prices that seem to be stuck somewhere in the 90s. Homemade jams, super friendly and speedy service, and the fact that I never have to wait long (if at all) for a re-up on my coffee are some of the highlights that await you at Lou's.

It was probably the best luck we'd had the entire trip. We were automatically greeted by a friendly gentleman who turned out to be the owner, Brian. He got us seated, and even though there were only three adults and my toddler, he insisted we sit in the bigger booth. He brought over crayons, a coloring menu, and play dough for my daughter, which as a parent, was already above and beyond most restaurants. Brian then brought us over samples of his homemade jam, which we obviously fell in love with and ended up buying a jar of the strawberry. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the fried fish I got but I'm sure you can't go wrong ordering anything there. My husband got the country fried chicken and our friend got the Reuben. When our food came, I was shocked at how much food I got. It was so good, I didn't want to stop eating even after I was full. My husband and our friend were absolutely blown away as well. Our waitress was so sweet and fast bringing us whatever we needed, I think her name was Anne. This place is so family oriented. We took a chance on this small business and it paid off more than we could have expected. We will be returning anytime we are in the area. I wanted to edit this to add that my husband got the chicken noodle soup, and the noodles are homemade and so delicious!",

    "text": "Bottomless cup of coffee, the real deal Polish sausage as opposed to some charred micro-link at chain places, friendly and fast service, favorable price range for most items, and a genuine locals atmosphere make Lou's the local historical icon that it is. It's well hidden, located in yet-another strip mall, so this was only the second time I've been, but I do remember the first: in the third week after moving to Las Vegas two years ago.   What did I have two years ago?  A crisp tuna melt. And a chocolate milkshake. All tasty.   The food at Lou's is what you can make at home. Standard eggs, pancakes, cakes, sausage, grilled cheese, soup, French toast, you name it. So you're not paying for any outrageous culinary experience, but more for the comfort of home. And to escape the chain race.  I'm DONE with the IHOPs and Denny's of the area. Lou's has become my new nextdoor go-to joint for casual meets with friends in those early hours of the day. Consistent, tasteful, local.",

The servings were straightforward, big portions, and tasty. We had our fill of breakfast choices. My one drawback is the pricing shown for Eggs Benedict here on Yelp is no longer correct. It's not $6. But that's not a deal breaker! Looking forward to trying other meals on the menu.",

I think grits would be better with cheese- but I added pepper, salt, and hot sauce and was happy  My bf had chicken fried steak, over easy eggs, and hash browns  The chicken friend stake came in a large serving, eggs perfectly runny - the did forget them at first but we're quick to remedy the situation-, the hash browns were good. I do like them a bit more cooked through but still good.  We shared a cinnamon bun. The dough was on the moist side, almost a bit mushy inside. The icing was amazing.  We also had their straw berry jam Yummy. Real pieces of strawberries  I'd come back",

My sister didn't get to get one as they said they didn't have it thawed, but due to that inconvenience they gave her a free cinnamon roll, and she ordered something else. We thought we were going to have an unpleasant experience at first since my pregnant sister in law got flicked off while parking from someone coming out the diner for no reason other than probably us being Hispanic, but we were wrong!

The menu is nothing fancy, but all the basics--omelettes, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak. There's a lunch menu, too, and a homemade pie or cake of the day, displayed on a cake stand under a handwritten sign. Everything I've tasted has been excellent, especially the home fries.

Simple American diner breakfast food cooked well.   Our waitresses (we had multiple checking on us and filling our coffee) were attentive and friendly. They all wore NFL jerseys of their favorite team.   I had the sausage link and cheddar cheese omelette. Grandma had scrambled eggs with diced ham and hash browns. The toddlers split a simple Bacon and Eggs breakfast with a big fluffy pancake.   We got in and out in about 45 minutes. Great for parents with young ones.   5 stars is for service, cleanliness, value and taste. For an economical diner, the new owners hit this out of the park. We will be back!",

We enjoyed the food and the experience, but it might be just a bit too old school for us. There is nothing wrong with kicking the cooking skills up a notch after all these years but they seem to still be doing okay, so what the hell. I doubt it we will be back though.   Worth stopping in to check out and maybe find an old favorite like mom or grandma made, or to invoke some memories of family times.    The family member servers were pleasant but clearly had no problem talking about new customers after they left, which I sadly overheard. It did leave a bad taste in my mouth, which the food could not cover up.   There are many things they could do that would build up their check sales also. Like asking customers if they would like dessert instead of dropping the bill on the table five minutes after their food is delivered. (Pet Peeve) . I was looking forward to a slice of the chocolate cake advertised on the board and was never asked if I wanted anything else. So I went somewhere else and gave them money for my sweet tooth.",

I pulled up my Yelp app, read a few of my Yelp friend's reviews, and made up my mind that I'm having eggs for lunch.  I walked in and it wasn't busy at all.  I sat myself and was a little concerned that the service would take a while since no one noticed me walking in.  Within 10 minutes, one of the waitresses attended to me and gave me a menu.  Their menu is mainly a traditional American breakfast (i.e. omelets, sandwiches, burgers, soups, etc.).  I kept my meal simple and had their 3 egg cheese omelet, 4 slices of bacon, well done extra crispy hash browns, and some toast.  This breakfast combo was very affordable at only $8.  I also added a cup of their homemade chili, which ended up being the highlight of my entire meal.  The chili has a bit of a kick, hearty, and had enough meat to satisfy my protein needs.  A cup of their chili is good enough to make me a repeat customer. If I had one gripe, it's the cheese in their omelets.  I prefer shredded cheese in my omelets, not sliced cheese. Lou's Diner was able to add shredded cheese to my chili.  Why couldn't they do this for their omelets? In the future, I'll request it.  It never hurts to ask, right?  This diner has been around a very long time.  It's nice to see businesses from the 60's still thriving.  It's also obvious that Lou's has its share of regulars.  The service was great and the price per dish is better than most.  I'm sure that I will be returning soon, especially if I'm craving their chili.",

You could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty . The cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing , not too sweat like cinnabon . They also have preserves that are made by the owner , and the raspberry is out of this world . I bought a small mason jar to take home . The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things . You have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as I did , and had to drive back around the block . I recommend you come and the server was very nice .",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp and Facebook for Lou's Diner recommendations. I have lived in Las Vegas for almost 19 years and never found this perfect little gem of a cozy country diner. It's probably my fault for not getting out as much, otherwise I probably would of found Lou's a lot sooner. I walked in a little after 6am and was greeted by Patty, one of the nicest lady you could have the pleasure of meeting or just talking to. I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat, but I am a sucker for a good Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. Patty was like, then that's what you will have. She told me pretty much everything is made from scratch, and after tasting that amazing Chicken Fried Steak, well lets just say, I imagine I am gonna have withdrawals and be forced to go back and fill my belly. I can't wait to try a bunch of other dishes too. I also wanted to thank Brian for coming up and asking me if I needed anything. I bet you couldn't find a nicer guy that runs a restaurant like he does. No wonder they are so successful. I could go on and on about how much I loved this place. But, I think you should bring your friends or family to Lou's Diner and experience what has been lost in this time we live in. Amazing decor, wonderful atmosphere, the sweetest and kindest waitresess, and of course Brian. This guy is doing it the right way and I thank him for that. So, stop reading and start driving to Lou's Diner and I promise, you won't be disappointed.",

It was packed when we arrived but we were great with a smile by a very nice gentleman (didn't get a name). So many menu options but we finally made a decision. I had breakfast chicken fried steak fried egg whites (special order), hash browns, toast, and coffee. Wow! Too much food for me. I was offered a choice of homemade jam yum! Everything was delicious. So, why a 3? Our waitress, Nancy, well, she wasn't very friendly. I could tell she was trying too hard to be nice to us. As I watched her interact with the other customers I could see the difference. When we got ready to leave or course I asked for s box and I asked if we could get some of that homemade jam to go (I had a lot of toast left) she said, \"no. I can't give you any to take\" and walked away. Really! So, we asked again. Same response. If Nancy would have been nicer I would have given a higher rating, as the food was delicious.",

The waitresses are helpful,  and few are actually walking talking stereotypes of a stereotypical 50 's and 60's era diner. Opinionated older women that roll their eyes a lot when commenting on current events. Lot's of \"color commentary \". I thought I'd stepped back in time,  I choose to put this in the \"good \" category,  but someone else might not dig it. The food portions are MASSIVE. Not necessarily flavorful - but humongous. The prices are more than fair,  the cost of a meal is *cheap *. The Bad. AND The Ugly.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. With O 'Brien potatoes,  scrambled eggs, and toast. With gravy.  The gravy was all but tasteless white goo. Pretty generic. Thank God for the salt & pepper. The chicken fried steak 's breading was like kevlar. The steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts. All in All,  I would not go back.  I wanted to like this place,  but I was disappointed.  The food was just not well prepared.",

The place is located in a little side strip mall and if you weren't looking for it you would probbly miss the joint.  I've really ever only been to Lou's for breakfast, but man do they know how to make breakfast.  The waitresses are usually quite prompt with greetingsand they almost immediately take your drink order and offer you a menu.  I am a big time breakfast eater and Lou's really make my belly feel all warm inside.  I don't have a favorite item on the menu, but I have probably tried them all.  I suppose you can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy.  I'm talking about real fresh buttermilk biscuits and homemade brown gravy underneath a some fresh scrambled eggs and cheese and you're in heaven.  Lou's is not expensive and it certainly isn't some posh, uppity location.  The place is clean and the food is delicious.  What more can one ask for!",

A very nice young man named Brian stopped at our table to ask if our food was ok; conversation led to us finding he was the new owner.  He informed us the only changes he made were to use social media to advertise and the addition of wifi-- he doesn't plan to change anything else.  Verdict:  Lou's is still (and will continue to be) a family-run, old fashioned family diner with excellent food and a neighborly vibe.  Breakfast is the real deal here... Delicious, and large enough you'll probably skip lunch.  Good quality food, nice wait-staff, and YOU feel like family when you are there.",

The diner's ability to stay around that long in a city filled with $4.99 breakfast buffets is a testament to the quality of their food. The diner is a quaint little place with a homey atmosphere. The skillet breakfast are among the best I've ever had with an ample amount of breakfast meats (something that most places skimp on) in all dishes. There are always a number of breakfast and lunch specials on the board which are always a good deal. There was a time a couple years ago where the service became a little spotty, but I'm happy to say the Lou's has resolved that issue. The service is now friendly and more importantly, quick. If you haven't tried Lou's it's worth checking out.",

I'm sure I'm dating myself but if you remember the TV show Alice and Mel's Diner it has that feel to it.  I've been in Vegas for 23 years and I wish I would of none about this place back then.  There is new owners Brian and Julie and they have not change anything they preserved everything the way it was for the past 40 years.  Very nice couple Julie makes all the cakes and pies home made.  The food is great the waitresses are super friendly Lisa , Rena, Patti and Linda and there are others also and there all good.  Besides the people that run it I have met so many nice people that are loyal customers I sit at the counter eat breakfast read the paper drink coffee and chit chat with everyone just a great place I'm a previous restaurant owner of different restaurant and can be quite a critic on restaurants and give this one thumbs up.",

This place screams country mom and pop country diner. There is a collection of items on the wall - this is a great place to play I Spy! As I walked in and took a look around, I was drooling over the huge piles of waffles drowning in whipped cream, steaming hot gravy on crispy chicken steak, and the generous portions of golden French fries.   The manager, Brian, was quick to greet us and push some tables together to accommodate our group of 6. He was very kind and made sure our two kids were well taken care of.   The kids ordered chicken strips and fries. It was a large cutlet perfectly fried with a generous portion of fries. We also ordered a Pastrami Reuben, Veggie Burger, Cheeseburger, and the Chef salad.   The coffee was hot, strong, and quickly refilled!  All of our meals came out quickly and perfectly.  I can only speak on behalf of the Reuben, but it was amazing! Perfectly crunchy toast, homemade thousand island dressing and a generous portion of pastrami. As soon as I started eating, I stopped talking and was focused on my meal.   I left that place a better person than when I went in.    If you are in North Vegas... DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER! You have reached your destination :)",

The staff is very friendly and all seem to like and support each other. The family that now owns Lou's is very active and involved. From make the rounds at the table to say hello and check in to serving coffee, busing tables just being team players the entire time. This is all great but the food is very diner fair but very good.

The menu had great variety with all of your traditional egg, omelet, pancake, french toast, and waffle options along with some options I don't see very often - grits,  S.O.S., cream chipped beef. They have \"Patty's Deluxe Cinnamon Roll\" that is certainly deluxe in size and looks made from scratch right on site. I ordered the eggs benedict with hash browns, which was right on point. The serving size was plenty, but not over the top so I was comfortably content when I was done. The staff are very sweet and were quick to smile and say hello to their regulars by name. This will definitely be on my go-to list when I'm in that part of town and want a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with a good meal.",

The decor is somewhat retro with old-style tables, booths surrounding the room and every imaginable form and shape of memorabilia covering the walls. Although somewhat crowded when we arrived it was strictly \"seat yourself.\" I didn't ask if it was always this way or not.  Fortunately, there was  an open table and we were able to get right in even at a busy hour.   But we were waited on promptly, the coffee came right away and the food service was prompt and friendly.  And throughout the meal our coffee cups were never less than half full.   I had sausage, eggs and hash-browns, a somewhat ordinary meal owing to my gluten intolerance.  But it was well done.  Even the hash-browns, which few places seem to get right, were cooked perfectly.  My wife had the country fried steak which she really loved and also made comments about how well the hash-browns were done.  They served her a pot of what she thought was a raspberry-cherry jam to go with her toast.  Whatever it was, she said it was delicious.  She also ordered a take-away huge cinnamon roll which she ate later and really enjoyed.   If you want good food at reasonable prices with a somewhat unusual retro decor, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Housemade Cinnamon Roll Flapjacks Monte Cristo Banana Cream Pie Lemon Cake  Located on Decatur and feeding locals for decades under the watchful eye of its eponymous owner, Lou's Diner is the sort of place one could drive by one hundred times without even a second thought, and yet with prices a fraction of those just a few miles east plus the sort of old-timey service guaranteed to leave a smile on every face the spacious spot is perhaps the very definition of diamond in the rough.  Certainly not upscale, and not exactly sporting much curb appeal in the back of a complex near Arizona Charlies and the Charleston Antique Mall, a visit to Lou's Diner is the sort that starts with a bit of skepticism about what will be found inside, but greeted with warm smiles and walls decorated with every sort of nick-knack imaginable the scene unfolds much like any similar spot in middle America, though in this case several-fold cleaner with a specials board complimenting a well-culled menu of breakfasts, soups, sandwiches, and more.  Seating perhaps sixty, and soon to reach half-capacity about thirty minutes after a 6:45am arrival, it was after short perusal that decisions were made from the all-day options, and with jokes made that \"you must real hungry\" from the waitress it was with the second of about thirty coffee warm-ups that she departed, a curious Lou and her spouse stopping by inquisitively to ask why pictures were being taken before offering to lead me around the and show off the map of where all their visitors had come from - the wall of mismatched mugs belonging to \"regulars\" an appropriate amenity as nearly every other diner was greeted by name by the staff nearly the moment they opened the front door.  Ordering with a request for items to be brought as ready it would not be long before the Housemade Cinnamon Roll arrived beneath a ladle of of sweetened cream cheese, and with a core rife with cinnamon plus plenty of yeastiness acting to offset the richness the results spoke to old-school craftsmanship without a whole lot of fuss, a similar style employed in two desserts enjoyed later that day in the form of a moist lemon layer cake and banana cream pie that was unfortunately a bit short on fruit but still quite flavorful with a pudding base beneath a mountain of whipped cream.  Assuredly a place with skilled line-cooks, on this particular morning a trio working at great pace with plates coming through the window every couple minutes, course two arrived shortly after the last of the frosting was scraped from the cinnamon roll plate and quickly eschewing pseudo-syrup in favor of pure maple goodness brought from home the thin flapjacks proved fluffy and full of buttermilk while the Monte Cristo finally answered the question of where to find an authentic iteration in the (702) - each deep fried bite packed with ham and turkey bursting forth with flavor beneath two gooey cheeses, a powdered sugar sprinkling and spread of strawberry jam seeing the Diner-classic complete.  Easily overlooked in favor of familiar chains, local groups slowly expanding their brand, and fanciful new spots on The Strip, Lou's Diner is a throwback to 'greasy spoons' speckled across America - a place that feels familiar, friendly, and full of nostalgia with the sort of food that is at-worst straightforward, and otherwise genuinely delicious and authentic.",

Asked for an egg white omelet with extra crispy hashbrowns; Very bland eggs (it looked spiced but didn't taste like it, must have been old dried out spices that lost all flavor) and hashbrowns (obviously frozen) were still raw in the middle. Add in the decor looks like my great grandmother vomited the 50s all over the walls, and it was quite an unpleasant experience for me at least. The one redeeming quality (hence 2 stars not 1) was the wait staff were very nice, helped to sort out the menu for my mother who couldn't read the specials board, and the waitress was quick to refill drinks and bring over hot sauces to add on the food, which were desperately needed. I personally won't return, but my mother enjoyed it. Take the retiree's without taste buds here for a trip down memory lane. \"Oh look, a rotary phone you talk into the wall with, we had one of those when gas was a nickel!\" Sure ma.......Sure......",

Lunch stuff like BLT, burgers and other sandwiches.   We seated ourselves had someone taking our drink order as fast as that and they kept them full. My husband asked about menu items and was told they'll do it all anytime!   We ordered breakfast today. My scrambled eggs came with country potatos bacon and grits love it with tuns of butter!

Food was exactly what you'd expect from an old school diner. The corn beef hash is as good as what you'd find in the South. Their home made preserves are phenomenal. We ordered one pancake to see what they can do on the griddle - their batter needs a little work compared to other local pancake houses. Everything else was nothing short of perfect. Will make this our regular breakfast place.",

    "text": "This is a place that could be straight from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  I was meeting friends for breakfast this morning but it fell through and I didn't get the memo.  After sending a text and finding out we weren't meeting, I searched the Yelp app for breakfasts restaurants and this was one of them that came up.  Off I was.  I was going south on Decatur and drove right on by when I noticed the blue symbol on my map was going away from Lou's.  I made a u-turn on a side street and started north on Decatur and there it was, tucked in a small strip mall removed some from Decatur and not having much curb notice.  When I went in, the first thing I noticed was the large amount of bric-a-brac in the restaurant most of it related to kitchens both commercial and home.  One thing that caught my eye was a box from my first food processor, a Veg-O-Matic.  It made me smile because I realized how old it was and therefore me.  My server, Patty, was to my table almost before I sat down (the sign says to seat yourself) and she was back quickly with coffee, a glass of ice water, and a menu.  After looking at the menu for awhile and checking the specials board, I ordered their chili and cheese omelette.  I had my choice of a couple of kinds of potatoes but I went with grits.  I also ordered rye toast.  Within a short time, my breakfast was delivered.  Everything was very good.  Patty asked if I wanted any hot sauce other than the Tabasco that was on the table and I asked for Cholula.  There was a nice container of butter with the grits and I let it melt and mixed it around with the grits.  Service was excellent!  Patty was back often to refill my coffee and it was a pleasant breakfast.  Since I was wearing a Syracuse t-shirt so close to the freeway, Patty assumed I was from out of town and she asked where I was from.  When I said Las Vegas, she asked how I found Lou's.  When I said, \"Yelp,\" she asked, \"What's Yelp!\"  I explained briefly and shower her the app and she got the idea.  She was interested to know I'd be rating Lou's before the day was done.    One last thing--there's a cardboard sign hanging on strings that says \"Triple Chocolate Cake\" and it has three arrows pointing to a cake holder on the counter.  I couldn't resist.  I bought a piece to bring home and have for dessert tonight.  I'm sure it will be just as good as breakfast!  This is a good breakfast spot.  The hiking group may rue their snubbing of me!  Addendum:  The chocolate cake was excellent!",

I'm so so glad we did because we both loved everything about Lou's Diner.... Let me start off by saying when we first walked in we were immediately greeted as a pregnant woman my body temperature always fluctuate's I was happy it was nice & cool inside they're not stingy with there Ac like other places, we got to seat ourselves & were immediately served with menus & our beverages.  I like the waitresses because they're all welcoming & knowlegeable about the menu. The food was EXCELLENT the prices were decent for the amount of food you get. They make there own jelly & ask you what kind you want....it's so yummy you must try! The owner Brian makes it a point to say hello & what I like about him is he actually walked to all the tables to see & make sure everyone was happy.....you rarely see that now at days, I felt very comfortable that he took the time to come up to my husband & I talk to us & asked us about our honest opinions about the food & service he's pretty awesome even shaking my husband's hand before we left. I can't wait to go back to try all the other yummy foods on the menu.  If you're in or around the Las Vegas area I would defenietly recommend stopping by Lou's Diner",

Hands down, Lou's and really not even close! I also got a sweet roll to start and might be the best I've ever had! And my 10 year old loved her pancake. She said I had to put that in. And we are still here to leave this review which means they aren't rushing us to fill our seat with the next guest.",

Order was wrong twice, ordered hash and got home fries instead, and then this last time my tiny poached egg was hard boiled! Another time we waited an exceedingly long time for our order with others around us receiving their food even though they arrived later and ordered way after us. We questioned the whereabouts of our order and after about another 20 minutes were finally served. Not sure it's worth driving all the way here anymore.",

Brian met us at the door with the friendly face and directed us to a booth ... he came to tell us about the specials and I told him I was looking for pancakes ... he told me all the different ways they prepare pancakes: with fruit , Jam/preserves, chocolate  chips, sweet cream, etc ... I mentioned I thought the sweet cream would be good as I wanted to put my eggs  directly on top of my pancakes ... when our friendly waitress, Renee, arrived we started chatting and I forgot to order it with the sweet cream as I had so many things on my mind ... when Brian discovered I had forgotten to order this sweet cream he had them make a special sweet cream pancake and brought it to us with their homemade preserves of strawberry, raspberry, peach ... OMG  so delicious!! It reminded me of a childhood favorite    Brian and Renee had no idea that I had had such a hard morning with my parents memorial, but they absolutely made my day!! Their kindness, generosity, friendly faces and amazing, tasty food (home fries  a MUST ... bacon  and eggs  cooked to perfection) will definitely have me returning many times over ... I'm already planning on going back for their Monte Cristo and I definitely need to check out their chocolate Belgian waffle topped with ice cream  also   Treat yourself and say YES to Lou's Diner",

    "text": "I am a sucker for an old fashioned diner. The chrome. The 50s music. The atmosphere. The diner classics on the menu. Further proof that I was born in the wrong decade. So I was pleased when I walked in to Lou's Diner for lunch yesterday and saw everything I wanted it to be.  The sign walking in says to seat yourself so took a seat at the bar. I'd advise against that. The stools are mounted to the floor and are too close together. Its hard to get in and out. Plus they are a bit far from the counter. I felt like I was sitting on the edge to eat. A table or booth would be better.  As I was looking at the menu my waitress, Dorene, pointed out the specials for the day. Sloppy Joes which sounded pretty good but I went for a Philly cheese steak served with fries instead. While I waited for that order to come, I read the history of the diner as printed on the back of the menu. It isn't the most exciting story but I love history so it was interesting regardless. And reading passed the time until my food arrived.  My sandwich, the Philly, was loaded with peppers and onions cooked just slightly and retained a little crunch. That was nice. There was a good bit of gooey cheese, provolone I believe, which is always appreciated. The roll was perfect. Soft with a little chew. The beef, though, was not my favorite. It was thicker cut than what I am used to in a Philly. And it didn't taste like the best quality meat. It wasn't bad but I've had better. As for the fries, typical shoe strings. They seemed rather mass produced but a squeeze of ketchup and down they go.  I also ordered dessert on this visit. Peach cobbler to go. I was urged to eat there since it would be warmed up and served with ice cream. But I had to get back to work so I declined and took it to go. I don't care much for ice cream anyway. I ate the cobbler as soon as I got back to the office and it was good. It reminded me of the cobbler I used to make with my mom.   The diner was fairly quiet at 1:30 in the afternoon. There were a couple of customers I could tell are regulars as the diner staff was greeting them by name and talking to them frequently. Service, for me, was friendly enough but not overly attentive beyond ordering and paying. Not that I mind. I really just want to order, eat and leave. I did so here without much delay.   Lou's is alright for the atmosphere. I may come back some time when I want to get away for lunch and don't want fast food. As a destination, meh. As an alternative, right on.",

We got our orders promptly and everything was delicious.  We'd lived here in Las Vegas for over 15 years and never knew that we have a B-L dining treasure within 2 miles from us.  Brian (the owner) brings that \"we're glad that you're here\" feeling to your table and Doreen is very attentive when you need that extra refill or take-home home-made cinnamon roll.  Yeah!!!  We'll be back next  Sunday to try more off your menu.  (We'll see you at lunch too.)",

My Bf loves the Brads Burrito ( this is a breakfast burrito with eggs hash brown sausage bacon and a green sauce over the top (we get it on the side)  We can't say enough good things about it.

Found this gem through yelp, it had great reviews so we decided to go here. Everything was delicious and they even gave us some crackers and samples of their jams to try while we waited for our food. We ended up buying some to take home because it was just that good, I believe we bought the raspberry one. Everyone was really friendly and you could tell all the locals had really good bonds with the employees and owner! My favorite parts of the meal were the juicy sausage and cooked to perfection home fries :) The prices are also really fair compared to all the other locations we ate at in and around Vegas.",

Great, old fashioned waitresses and decor that obviously hasn't changed in years made this a trip back in time.

We moved to the east coast where hometown, small town diners are abundant. Then we found ourselves right back here in Vegas wanting to find that hometown diner kind of place. Well, we found it at Lou's Diner. It's got everything you love about little diners! The food was amazing. The staff was super friendly and spoke to us like they've known us forever. And the owners, Brian and Julie, and even their little boy, walk around visiting and checking in with diners. We will definitely be coming back to this place!",

You feel at home the moment you are seated.  Shannon was a delight; so fast and helpful. The food was excellent and the service even better. This is the type of place that reminds you of your home town. And the hand-made jam was a bonus.  We highly recommend Lou's Diner. Especially the steak and eggs. And my wife really liked her French toast meal.",

Dicing as usual.  The die instructed him to order 2 pancakes but wouldnt you know it, we forgot!       How can that be?   We are old?    No...well, yes but no.  They brought out their delicious HOMEMADE jellies and we fell in love with the raspberry (Grape was amazing too)   and we really forgot all about anything else except that jelly which they sell by the way and we bought a jar for $8, that is actually a great deal for something homemade!  I was instructed just to order a pepsi and I also ordered Huervos Rancheros, heck I dont even know if that is what its called and I know its not spelled right!   I am including pics though.  Its a tortilla with eggs on top, green sauce and refried beans and cheese which is the best I have had in Las Vegas for sure and then I got the homefries and they were delicious!  Jaqueline was our waitress, super friendly, outgoing and attentive!   The restaurant is clean, busy but you get to seat yourself so that takes some stress out and they are very comfortable!  So Yeah...lets aim for a return visit before Halloween!?!",

No, seriously, the people who eat there are all regulars (or they sure seem to be) and the owner Brian goes table to table, greeting the customers and thanking them for stopping by.  The staff is friendly, and when one of the servers saw it was our first time at Lou's, she made sure to give us a sampler of their housemade preserves.    For breakfast, Karen had the pancakes and eggs with toast, while I had the ham steak, eggs, and choice of grits or hashed browns and toast... I chose my grits!  OMG was everything perfectly cooked, and the coffee was nice and strong.  It's also inexpensive!! 2 breakfast entrees and a coffee came to under $20, and the portions were very generous.  In fact, we loved it so much we went back again the next day before heading back to the OC.  Karen had the Loco Moco, a Hawaiian classic.  When the owner stopped by to see how we were doing (and thanked us for stopping by, again) Karen raved about her Loco Moco and he smiled in appreciation.    Overall, a great hidden gem about 15 minutes from the Strip.  I do believe it'll be my new \"go to\" breakfast stop while in Vegas.  Thumbs up!",

Our waitress was so nice and very friendly with excellent customer service... she started us off with our drinks and keeped it filled throughput service... there were two managers walking around and talking to all the tables telling them about the specials... i had the steak and eggs with home style potatoes and toast... everything was very tasty and cooked how i liked it... and the home made strawberry jelly was AWESOME! I never had anything like it... i gotta try the other ones... my daughter had the Julie's special which was an bacon and cheese and mashed potatoe omelette with hash browns... she and i ate evey last bit... what was so impressive was no matter how busy it was they still came and checked on us on how are meal was and if we needed anything else at least 3 times... yes this cozy little place is 5 stars for sure... we will be back...",

    "text": "Old School and wonderful!  Fifty years! Yes, Lou's Diner has been serving locals since 1969 when Joe Fallon and his wife Ellen opened the doors of their restaurant for the first time. Three years later they hired a waitress named Louise Walters. Joe and Ellen retired in 1985 and sold the restaurant to Kwak and Yee Ho. Nine years later, in 1994, the Hos sold the restaurant to Chris Ells. When in 1997 Chris decided to sell the restaurant, Louise, who had been working in the restaurant all this time, and her husband Jim Lauber decided to jump in and buy the place. They renovated the place and ran it for 18 years. In December of 2015 Louise and Jim decided to retire and sold the restaurant to the current owners, Brian and Julie.  Lou's is located off Decatur south of U.S. 95. It is mostly obscured by a Walgreen's, but that does not prevent the crowds of customers from swarming in every day.  The coffee at Lou's is fresh and hot, and the menu offers many comfort food options such as chicken fried steak and catfish and a full roster of sandwiches that includes their Monte Cristo and beef dip. If you visit, try their house made jams, they are delicious.",

I choose this place to be my number one spot for breakfast bringing out of town guests and just to meet up with a good friend. I ordered my eggs sunny side up because I love them soft and runny. They were perfect. Along with a order of Kielbasa sausage and a bowl of Grits. Homemade strawberry jam. Huh! Butter was like icecream and my bread was lightly toasted. 100% Vegas gem. Staff is awesome and the people are friendly. One of the top five places to eat breakfast in Vegas.",

The atmosphere is amazing and you feel welcomed from the moment you walk in. Service is impeccable, food is delicious (homemade jam is soooo yuuum) and the owner makes you feel like part of the diner family. We look forward to bringing the kids back for our next visit    What we ate:  Chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and toast with a side of short stack (pancakes)!!  Everything was beyond delicious. Food was cooked well and served hot and fast. Drinks were never left empty, jam came aplenty and I left stuffed but wanting more. I may have had a side of mixed berry jam as dessert.",

The service is always on top of things and even stop by to chat a bit. Not in a way that's intrusive or in a way that forces small talk but in such a way that makes you feel like you're pals.   We've had the waffles, burgers, chicken fried steak, pancakes and all of it was consumed so fast we did not have time to take pictures. In fact, it's the kind of place that makes you WANT to put your phone down and pay attention to the family in front of you and food on your plate.",

We had fantastic delicious breakfast food, great company, and appreciated the warm niceness from our waitress and the gentleman who was helping seat customers.  At one point I saw him run after a couple (with a baby in a carrier) who walked in and didn't see a table open just to let them know he was clearing out a table for them to sit at.  Every person who walked through the door greeted him and the other wait staff which I absolutely loved!   Fantastic little spot with plenty of parking, a cool history on the diner and how it has evolved with Las Vegas, and a fantastic view of the mountains in the background as you make your way over from downtown LV.",

It feels like a small town diner from an era before. It's really quaint and the staff are all amazing. Patty was our waitress and did an incredible job checking in with us and refilling our coffee.  I got the special of the day- Strawberry Stuffed French Toast with a side of home fries, and my wife ordered the Pan San (pancakes with eggs, meat).  The pancakes were fluffy and soft (not rubbery or dense like Ihops), and the strawberry stuffed French toast was seriously delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. The sausage links served on the side were massive and delicious, the eggs were cooked to perfection.  This is definitely going to be our new regular breakfast spot!",

I saw this little spot hidden spot I should say and decided to go here not knowing what to expect. At first it seemed like a mistake coming in here. Then I saw the menu ordered the Ruben sandwich...... I bring my family every time they come from out of town this is the place to come. The food is the best food next to my mother's food. Its delicious!!! Its absolute perfection coming to this diner. I've had nothing better in Vegas California Texas Arizona or Georgia or Utah. Thus place is where they created the most simplest way to make delicious food. The home made jam is a must! The steak made me dream about it 2 days later!! But theeeeeeee best thing to eat when its available has to be the HUMMINGBIRD CAKE. My goodness its again perfection shaped like a cake. Its a hidden gem service is excellent its got a 60's vibe to it which I love decor is old school and I believe the owner greets you at the entrance and check's up on you from time to time. Longest review I've ever done and this place deserves it. I posted no pictures of this place because I haven't yet decided which one is the one that deserves that price cause everything I've had here is super delicious.",

My husband heard that ownership had changed, so he and his buddy went for lunch. OMG, he just wouldn't stop raving about how good the food was.... So, I had him take me for breakfast! Don't tell him, but he was right!! The waitresses are \"classics\", there's old photos of Las Vegas and kitschy trinkets all over the walls; it's a homey atmosphere. The owners regularly roam the dining area connecting with their customers. Lou's offers both breakfast and lunch during the limited daily hours. They have daily specials, homemade preserves and delicious homemade desserts. The portions are good for the price and the food is delicious! I highly recommend a visit to this Las Vegas classic.",

The wait was really no problem as all the food coming out looks great, but,,,we had to keep flagging down (which I hate having to do) in order to get coffee and ice tea refills.  The food finally came, nacho, eggs benedict, eggs were perfect, hollandaise was perfect and the potatoes were nice and crisp.  I loved my open face turkey, but, I really felt it could have been a lot hotter. Uriel got the tenders and fries but for 9.99 and only 2 pieces it was was overpriced.

I made a mental note to come back during business hours but I soon forgot and living in the NW we usually just go to Cracked Egg or Bagel Cafe when we go out for breakfast. The other day I mentioned Lou's to my wife and looked at their hours and we were lucky enough to have enough time to make it over. It was worth the wait. Hands down the best breakfast I've had in the valley. That was last Friday. This Friday we went to Lou's again. My wife had the fried egg sandwich again. She loves it especially with their homemade mixed berry jam. I had the pancakes and egg breakfast last week. Best pancakes ever. Today I had the tuna melt and clam chowder. Amazing. Their desserts are also spectacular. We got them to go both times. I can't wait until next Friday to see what delicious meal I'll order.",

The owner introduced himself to us, checked back to make sure we were enjoying our food, is a very kind soul.  The waitress was terrific and warm with a good sense of humor.

Went back today for late lunch around 2 ( they close at 3) to try their catfish. $799 menu states comes with your choice of potatoes and veggies.  Server was in a hurry, no customers just in a hurry to get out as she stated several times. Did not ask for our choices ans hurried off. Came back with plates with 2  small catfish fillets thickly breaded, MASHED potatoes covered in beef gravy, even on the fish! Who serves mashed potatoes and beef gravy with fish? We are vegetarians, don't eat any meat other than fish. A little bowl of canned veg all and a stale roll. WOW, then when we asked for another plate to get the fish off the plate with the gravy she brought the plate and picked up our fish with her bare hands! Owner sat 2 booths away, oblivious. Disappointed !  So limit you visits to breakfast, we will if we return.",

    "text": "Lou's is a little \"hole in the wall\" gem that I came across about 2 years ago while searching and searching for an east coast diner type place here in the little old desert.  One of the reasons that I give Lou's 5 starts is because they have \"old fashioned\", no frills, down home eats .... Things like Creamed Chipped Beef which most people out here don't even know about.    Everything at Lou's is made from scratch.  They are open limited hours - like 6am to 2pm and are closed on Sundays and maybe Mondays (I can't remember).  Lunch specials are about $6.99 and they include salad or soup - you really can't beat it.  I normally come here on the weekends for cream chipped beef - something my mom always made but for whatever reason - it's damn near impossible to find the proper dried beef out here.   In addition to the creamed chipped beef - we've also ordered french toast, various sandwiches from tuna melts to clubs and I've also had their home made New England clam chowder and chicken n' dumplings.  You seriously CANNOT beat $7.99 for a big ole' bowl of chicken n' dumplings and a cup of clam chowder.  The claim chowder is seriously one of the best chowders that I've had in Vegas.   The owners are a very friendly husband and wife who are often seen sitting in their \"office\" (a booth in the back of the restaurant) and the staff is ALWAYS friendly.  The male half of the couple does all of the baking and he makes some GREAT pie as well as some moist as chocolate layer cake.",

Over the years I've tried the eggs, omelets, chicken fried steak, oatmeal, bagel and fruit combos, but the real stand-out is their skillet breakfast. They also offer grits in lieu of potatoes.  The other breakfasts are truly average, but the skillet is loaded with hash browns, your choice of meat, (your choice of anything else actually - onions, peppers etc) loaded with cheese and topped with eggs any style.   Lou's probably rates 3* but I'm bumping it up one because it's the best skillet I've found thus far in Vegas (and also I see my priest in there occasionally - don't know why that influences me, but for some reason it does).",

Walls covered in trinkets, pictures and knick-knacks and not a spec of dust...My house isn't as clean as this restaurant.  Service was more than adequate, about what you'd expect from a place that could've been pulled right from a 70's sitcom.  Lots of colorful characters enjoying their Sunday lunches, old regulars being sassed by the staff.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, our side salads were drenched in watery ranch dressing causing them to be more of a very odd cold soup of iceberg, tomatoes, cucumbers and yes...beet slices (?!).  Not inedible by any means, and maybe the institutional ranch dressing mix (this is NOT a slight...I actually love institutional ranch) was running low.  But unusual.  I had the New York Strip steak sandwich, which was functionally a slab of meat on two pieces of toast.  However, it was a FANTASTICALLY prepared slab of meat.  Perfectly cooked medium rare, perfectly seasoned.  Tender, juicy...honestly the best steak I've had in years.  It was so good, I didn't care about the ranch soup or the plain toast.  The steak made it all.  Fantastic job guys.",

The food on the other hand was pretty good,I ordered the tuna melt with fries and a dinner salad, the dinner salad was just basic, the fries were not really fully cooked in my eyes, but the tuna melt was out standing!

    "text": "We always drive by this diner and I've always been curious if it will be that gem I'm looking for. This has definitely been around long enough, 40 years and probably some of the old folks that are a majority of their patrons, have been regulars since this diners heyday.   When you walk in, it feels dated in that way your grandparents would be. Lots of knick knacks on the walls and photos. The food is no frills type American diner fare, and cheap with pretty much everything under $10. My one thing is that the menu isn't really descriptive and while you wouldn't need a explanation for a tuna melt some things I would like to know. I could ask the waitress, but there was only one and she was running around so I felt I may be wasting her time.   I went with a chicken fried steak since lately I've been in a mood for it. It was decent as far as they go. I can see why people like theirs here, but it's not my favorite in town.   The BF got chicken and dumplings that was on the specials board. It comes with soup or salad and he got the clam chowder. The clam chowder was standard and decent. The chicken and dumplings was homemade and plentiful, dumplings really fluffy. I wish it had a bit of veggies in it, but otherwise it was good.   It was solid, but nothing wow-ing really.   I heard they may have homemade pastries pie here, but apparently they don't anymore really do that. Ah, boo.   It's a A-OK diner, but it didn't click that perfect homey feel for me.",

So I ended up paying for nasty biscuits and gravy that I didn't even eat. Would not return!",

As we got out of our vehicle, I could smell wonderful food cooking smells. Inside we got one of the last tables, which is a sure sign of a good restaurant. But this restaurant exceeded all of our expectations! Not only was the service beyond excellent but conversations with one of the owners was memorable, as he learned what we liked and pointed out a possible shopping gold mine. The real gold mine, we found was the food. Everything cooked to delicious perfection! Our teen, who was crappy, surly, and \"not hungry\", ate an entire Brad's Burrito!  The best part of all, is that the owners \"office\" is a corner booth, and they walk around, and visit with the clientele.",

The decor is like a cross between Mayberry and Happy Days so you immediately feel at home. The menu is quite large and filled with comfort food.  As soon as I sat down, a waitress was at the table with a menu greeting me. I ordered the patty melt which is my comfort food and it was so good. The patty, the onions, a lot of melty gooey cheese and the bread was perfectly toasted but not greasy.   As I was eating, I looked around the diner and listened to the waitresses greet people as they came in. Obviously, a lot of the patrons are regulars and I can see why.  The diner is clean, the waitresses friendly, the food is good and priced fairly. Will I be back, you betcha!",

The sandwich was nicely stuffed with ingredients, fried just so, came with the necessary raspberry jam, and tasted great!  My french fries were nothing special but good, and I'm told the coleslaw was good. Wait service was excellent.

My friend had their pancakes which I wanted to finish FOR her. They cooked their bacon to order which was awesome, as was their patty sausage.  It's standard diner food, but done really well. And their warm, personable customer service puts them over the top! I would LOVE to go again next time I'm in town.",

It's a real down home diner style location in a strip mall near Taco Bell (in case you have a hard time finding it - there is a sign you can see from the road though) The food is pretty good. The BF didn't care for the sausage patty or the biscuits & gravy. I ordered the skillet with sausage & country potatoes - it was good. The service is good, a little rough around the edges but that seems to be along the lines of down home style. The parking is very limited. We will return.",

When I got to the restaurant to pick up the orders no one seemed to know that they are on Yelp until a woman said oh yeah the big order and seemed to be bothered by it. She than told me that she just wrote the order up and it will be sometime, I asked her OK about how long she walked over to the cooks came back and said yeah so that will take sometime, I had to then guess as to how long the wait would be and said so 15 mins and she said no it shouldn't be that long, I told her that the yelp app said that it would be ready by 110pm,. she then seemed really bothered and asked me, now why would it say something like that, I told her I didnt know but I can show her the confirmation, she walked away, I then took a seat anywhere because I wasn't offered to sit as I wait for my order i put in over 20mins ago and the yelp app said that it would be ready at 110pm. I sat there for 5 mins when she brought my food to me, I thanked her a few times and she never responded to me. I get back to my office and realized that one of our orders was missing and the turkey sandwich did not have Bacon on it like described in the menu on yelp so called the restaurant to notify them of the error and they said the order that was missing was not on the order, I then said it was and they said wait yep it is and to come and it will be ready in 2 mins, I went over and got the order and they gave me the bacon for the sandwich, then the lady told me that she gave us the turkey sandwich not the turkey club, and expanded to me what the club was and why the bacon was not on it. I will never order from here again which it isn't because the food was bad the food was actually pretty good, it was the way the waitress made me feel and wanted to argue her point to me instead of stepping back to listen to me and my concerns, she wanted to argue the missing meal and the sandwich why it didnt have the bacon. The food is good the service is not.  Thank you, Amanda",

    "text": "What a sad day. I have been bringing my family here for years. My daughters have known these waitresses since they were born. When Lou sold the place we didn't go as much, because the prices went up. We would still visit on occasion. When I would show up I was greeted by my first name and they always knew what I would eat. Today I met my wife and daughter there for breakfast. I didn't recognize the waitresses, which is no big deal. I waited for a much longer time than necessary for them to just ask me what I was drinking. We ordered our food and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. People all around us were getting their food. People that showed up well after we ordered. After waiting for over 45 min, my wife, daughter and I left hungry and frustrated. It feels as though one of my favorite places has closed down for good, but the sad thing is that they are still open.  I may try one last time before I give up for good, but a place that felt like visiting Grandma's house, is starting to feel like a chain restaurant where your nothing more than a unpaid bill.",

That establishment still exists, it called Lou's Diner.  Our party of four tried Lou's Diner by chance as we initially drove by our first choice only to be greatly disappointed in the wait (of course I re-checked Yelp for our alternative) and I'm really glad we did.  Everyone loved Lou's.  Quality of food, speed, attentiveness, and of course . . . the great prices!  We left beyond full and making sure our waitress knew that we would be back (with more of our family too)!  Good coffee, pancakes, and breakfast burritos just to name a few.  Can't wait to get back there and try something else (or get those pancakes again)!",

A few weeks back I decided every time I have to be at the new place to meet a contractor, after the meeting i'll hit a breakfast place.  It's been ages since I've been to Lou's so I decided to include it on my breakfast place list.  Place looks exactly like it did when I tried it over 4 years ago.  I believe the cook was the same ( is it Lou ? )   Ordered ham steak, eggs o/e, rye toast.  I believe it was $8.  I expected a lower price given low rent district, presumably low overhead given nothing has changed in the place in over 4 years, so maybe the serving size is ala hash house a go go , uhhhhh, that's a negatory  Food was average - a little too much oil puddling on the eggs but not a big deal given the grease in the hash browns.  Probably closer to 2.5 stars but I round up given the place for so dang long - props to them.",

    "text": "I am a huge proponent of shopping locally, and this includes my quests for good food in hidden away places.  This is why stumbling across (OK stumbling isn't quite right, Google Maps helped and I won't eat breakfast on the strip) this gem of a greasy spoon.  I say hidden because it is off Decatur snuggled in behind a Taco Bell.  When I first walked in the door I was warmly greeted and took a seat at the counter, which is my favorite spot when dining alone.  My waitress' name was Renee who greeted me with hot coffee and a menu and suggested that I make sure to read the history of the joint on the back of the menu; which kicked off my sense of nostalgia because I love stuff like that.  I ordered my staple of eggs over easy, hash browns with white toast and the ham steak.  my order came out perfect (so many places overcook the eggs) and it was delicious.  In fact there was more food than I knew what to do with and this from a guy who is 6' 3\" and clocking in at 218 lbs.  If I had any room left, I would have had a slice of that pink double layer cake that was so high that it took two people to slice a piece and juggle it in one piece onto a plate for a customer.  I am still thinking about that cake 24 hours later.  So back to the history of the joint.  Lou's diner has changed hands a couple of times over the many decades and has remained in some way or fashion in the family of the original owners.  Until this last December.  This is when a new couple (I am so sorry I totally forgot their names, but they were so nice) just starting out their lives together bought the joint.  When a place I like changes hands, it usually suffers an identity crisis as the new owners try to put their own stamp on it and make it better.  THANKFULLY, this couple understand what Lou's is and who their customers are....  And have kept it the way it should be.  That hidden away gem, that serves great food in a setting that I will be visiting again and again when I come back into town.",

Took my in-laws with us this time (they were looking forward to it because we've been talking this place up so much since the first time we came) and again they did not disappoint!  The place was packed (that's what happens when you have such an awesome place ) but we were still seated within minutes.  Brian, the owner, remembered us from our conversation last time, and even thanked me for the review (no need for thanks here- just writing an honest opinion about our experience but hey, you're welcome ).  He had us try some of their new HOMEMADE jam and it was DELICIOUS- (not too sweet)!  We ended up buying one of each: mixed berry, raspberry, and strawberry.   Didn't take pictures this time because I practically inhaled my food but I had \"brad's burrito\" and my husband had the veggie omelet. Thank you Lou's Diner for being so great.  If you want to enjoy a good homemade meal where everyone treats you like family- Lou's Diner is your spot.",
