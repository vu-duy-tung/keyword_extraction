The interior was probably the best thing I can recall here.  Service fitted the Asian restaurant stereotype with a shrugging attitude.  Everything will pretty much cost you at least twice as much compared to off-strip places.  We got the Dan Dan Noodles, Barbeque Pork, Oriental Fried Rice, and some Wonton Noodle.  Bland was probably my only description for the food.  Seasoning in soup broth, meat, and rice were definitely lacking.  The presentation was not anything unique for food charged at this price, and it looked about the same like any Chinese restaurants in Vegas.  Spent twice as much on food that tastes half as good...  Service was mediocre and the food was not packaged in any high class way to fulfill that luxury feeling.  I will have to be insane to dine at the Noodles again.",

However, this is my go-to place for casual Chinese food when I am in Vegas.  Noodles is also one of the reasons I prefer to stay at Bellagio.  They don't use msg (or so I am told) and the food is not greasy at all!  There are a couple dishes that my family and I really like and We stick to every time; Peking duck or the wonton noodle soup, combination fried rice, Hong Kong fried noodles and dim sum.   The Peking duck noodle soup is my so called \"morning after recovery soup\" after a long night out.  The broth is clean with the right balance of flavors, the egg noodle is crunchy and fresh.  The fried rice is probably one of my favorites because it's not greasy and just so damn tasty!  My sisters couldn't stop eating the fried rice, and they are picky! So you know it's good. The service is great.  Everyone is friendly and they all speak good English.   The downside of this place is they do not take reservation and the wait is long....Do come early or off hours.  If you are a MLife Gold member, the wait is not bad.  We were lucky we got in right away.",

I had ordered a honey bbq pork dish that was dry and really fatty. It was my first time returning ANYTHING in my life of eating out and I was still nice about everything. After that, the server gave us attitude until we left (snatching the dishes away, refusing to look at us and treating the table next to us way better). We still left a decent tip for  this a**hole. I realized i had left my card in the checkbook and came right back. The server disappeared and did not return it to security AND i was charged twice for my meal.

    "text": "Noodles ah... Noodles. Everyone that knows me can attest to how much I love yummy chew springy noodles.  So a restaurant to the name I have to give a second chance.   My review even based on the first time still remains unchanged. Let me start with a few good points if you find yourself in a late night Chinese food craving. This place has a good turn over (they need it cause it's tiny). Once seated after an initial wait the food comes very quickly and it's open late. One reason we stop here on a Sunday night.  Now the major fault of Noodles is two things price and attention to detail. And these two work in conjunction. For a $20 dollar bowl of pho there should be a very high end sense of quality. Expectation of the what they served is hardly any different from any Chinese Asian restaurant for way less.   Service aside which is better than most Chinese restaurant but still can stand major improvement is there attention to their own food. Normally when you  serve Thai food you ask how spicy the customer enjoys it. I ordered a spicy Thai shrimp noodle and received something so spicy it was almost inedible. If I have been aware I would have avoided the heartburn but that was my mistake no thanks to the person taking our order.   Venom aside this is a traditional Cantonese restaurant serving very basic Asian classics. If you don't mind the high prices and enjoy average wonton soup,fried rice ,pad Thai, congee, and dim sum yes you found it on the strip no doubt.  Alternative is to find the china town in Vegas.  Last little tip order food that is more Chinese in origin the Thai and Japanese selections are a bit out of their element.",

    "text": "I was a big fan of Noodles when it first opened so I made it a point to come back this weekend and try it again.  Maybe I'm spoiled from all the noodles I've tried since that first time or maybe I have learned enough in my dining adventures to determine what is good and what is bad.  In the end it was like a bad relationship. The problem wasn't that I changed the problem was just them.  The place was busy as most places were the weekend of the Pacquiao fight. We both ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and an order of shrimp dumplings. My friend who enjoyed most of the dumplings said they were ok but nothing to rave over. We both agreed the broth of the soup was too rich. Even with the addition of salt, pepper, and hot sauce we couldn't cut the richness of the soup.  I hoped that the noodles would save the dish but they were bland and flavorless. They seemed to be overcooked as it didn't compliment the broth at all.  The brisket came in really large pieces that were too tough for a soup so they had to be broken up by fork and knife.  The bok choy was probably the best compliment to the soup.  Service was like a stereo Chinese restaurant.  We couldn't understand our waitress and had a tough time flagging her down. We tried to get assistance from bus people but they refused always stating we had to go to the our waitress for everything. Look I don't mind keeping the place traditional but it's Vegas good service is expected as the prices we pay demand it. Especially if the food is overpriced.   In the end like the relationship I mentioned before it was like returning to an old girlfriend for me. You realize why you haven't gone back in a while. It was a nice attempt at re-kindling a memory of a great meal from my past but as time would have it people change and so do restaurants.",

So much for the \"supposedly\" famous chef from China...   Wonton Noodle ($15.25) - Sure, the taste is somewhat authentic, but the flavor isn't that good. The noodle & soup broth are just ok, nothing special. The wonton's actually decently good, but given the pretty small portion & expensive price, it's definitely not worth it.  BBQ Noodle Soup ($15.25) - I wouldn't get this again... The BBQ isn't good at all, you guys're better off with the wonton.  In conclusion, this place isn't worth visiting for. Yeah sure, all food in Vegas're overpriced, but at least some of them taste decently good. I'd rather spend my 15 bucks eating at McDonald than here. Not only it taste pretty bad (I'd give it a 2 stars) & expensive, the portion's also pretty small; We went to get sandwiches right after...",

They have various different kinds of noodles on the menu, as well as dim sum on the weekends. They don't fall under one category of Asian food, but seem to try to include the entire spectrum. They have pho, Thai, and Chinese dry and soup noodles. I don't remember if there was ramen on the menu, but I did see ramen noodles on their wall display jars of the various noodles they serve. I got the Shrimp Thai Noodle Soup. The menu described it as Tom Yum, but it didn't taste like it at all... It was super bland, I could barely get through it. My brother ordered the beef noodle soup and he usually eats his  plate clean, no matter what, but he said it was too gross to finish. It is overpriced (about $20 per bowl) but I'm not even taking a star off for that because it is expected for every place in Vegas.",

Our dishes came quite quickly but to our disappointment they tasted pretty bland. We let our server know and she brought over some soy sauce, chili sauce, and some salt and white pepper.

    "text": "Go for the dim sum... Did I forget to mention the dim-sum? Yes, please try the dim sum!  I've had the pleasure of dining here three times, and I never had a bad meal. However, my last experience was more like an epiphany: I came here for dim sum.  I live in NYC and took an interest in tea houses that serve excellent dim sum, yet what I ate in NYC did not compare the dim sum served at Noodles. I was knocked clear off my feet with how scrumptious, flavorful and delightful it was. The line for dim sum was out the door (mostly asian customers who know where the good stuff is), and we waited for 45 minutes to be seated. Now we know why, it was sooooooooo worth the wait.   First, you must try the chicken feet. This is a must for any adventurous eater, and even the meek might be converted. It was perfectly braised; the tender gelatin fell off the bones in my mouth, and the sauce was a perfect balance between salty, sweet and savory with just a kiss of chili. My husband and I polished off 4 plates of this alone. Piles of bones on our plates laid testament to our enjoyment. The manager noted how much of it we'd polished off and mentioned \"It's very unusual for Caucasians to try chicken feet.\" we smiled and said we were from NYC, and then he said \"Ahhhh!\" with a big smile and nodded understanding that we weren't strangers to chicken feet (\"phoenix claws\").   Our next in the line of favorites was the pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings. This has always been a favorite of mine, and Noodles carries the crown for the best.   Not to be missed are the almond shrimp! Perfectly fried, studded in crisp almond slivers these shrimp are a joy to eat and have a wonderful texture.   Do not deprive yourself any longer, get some dim sum!",

Then Cindy randomly wanted to change our plates without asking. We were fine with our plates but she just tried to change it and kept saying no no you can't order that from me. WORST SERVICE I HAD ON OUR TRIP. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. GO TO THE CESARS PALACE PLACE INSTEAD. OH ALSO then wonton soup had no flavor in the broth. Only good thing was fried rice.

But Noodles has some points in its favour:  1. consistency - it's not fantastic one day, dreadful the next. It is consistently good; 2. cooperation - I have two food allergies. One of the few things that sends my beloved off the deep end is when I explain them in detail, and then a dish is served that features foods containing one or both of the prohibited items. Not so with Noodles. If I pick something that contains a no-no ingredient, they advise me in advance; and 3. variety - purists will decry the all-over-the-map options, but sometimes a wide selection is the best way around group dining issues.  If you plan on having the dim sum, note that it is not available everyday (sometimes only Friday-Sunday).",

We saw the sign for Noodles, and not having hit Asian in Vegas, all agreed to give it a try.   It turned out to be a very good choice for several reasons, the main reason is we ate our 6 dishes \"family style\", so none of us were locked into just one dish.  There was not really a consenous on which was the best dish, but I liked the Pad Thai and there was also an eggplant and tofu dish I liked. There were also some fried rice and curry dishes on the table. None of the plates had any food on them by the end of the meal.  Prices were reasonable and I felt there was good value for the money. It's a great location to eat if you are going to see O, just get to Noodles as soon as you can. While there was no line when we arrived 90 minutes before the early show, there was a line as we left.",

We waited almost 20 minutes only to be seated right outside the kitchen even though there were MULITPLE tables throughout the restaurant that didn't have people seated at them until 10 or 15 minutes after we were seated and some remained empty the entire time we were there!  The servers were nice but lacked knowledge and took forever in between table visits.  When ours finally came back I asked him if it was individual or family style serving and he didn't know what I meant.  *sigh*  It turned out to be family style (each dish could serve 3 or 4 easily).  I ordered the thai noodle tom yum soup and while the broth was arromatic and all, it lacked flavor.  I had to pull the veggies and shrimp out to slice them up so I could eat them without choking.  The cilantro was a great touch but it was like they braided it together and threw it in the bowl- I could only get huge chunks of it all at once.  I love me some cilantro but this is ridiculous.    Overall, I can't say I would return to Noodles.  The smoke from the casino wafted in on a regular basis seeing as there was absolutely NO separation between the two capping off the negative experience.",

    "text": "Honestly shocked at the negative reviews. I am from Chicago, but visit Vegas every year for an annual girls trip with my mom and sister. We absolutely LOVE Noodles and the only disappointment that I have with them is that they are not located in Chicago!  The staff are always so nice and the service is great. Many of the staff members are immigrants and it is really special getting to know them and their stories throughout our visits. We make sure to visit multiple times during our trip because in my opinion, one time isn't enough.  We order the spring rolls and tempura veggies as appetizers and then individual bowls of chicken or wonton soup with egg noodle. We also enjoy a few pots of Jasmine tea during our meal.  For dessert you MUST try the mango sticky rice. It is simple but so delicious! During our most recent visit they ran out of mangos for the evening, but our waiter Kenny saw how disappointed we were and literally went to the cafe in Bellagio to grab another mango for us. What a rockstar!  To address the reviews saying that the menu is expensive, it definitely isn't cheap, but it also isn't over-priced. All of these restaurants are pricey and atleast you get quality food and excellent service here!  Please ignore the negative reviews because this is honestly a great hidden gem. And please if you've had a bad experience go back and try the spring rolls, soup, and mango sticky rice - I promise you won't be disappointed.",

The Singapore noodles were done right. The Cantonese roast duck was very subtle in flavor, but I think it was authentic.  The staff is all Asian  giving it a great ambiance. We were happy.",

Our order took nearly 45 minutes to arrive from the time we sat down, making us late for the Cirque Du Soleil show we were seeing at 7:00pm. It turned out that our waitress forgot to put our order in to the kitchen (we saw her remember our table 30 minutes after taking our order and scurry to the front to put our order into the computer). When my father asked her about this, the waitress told us a blatant lie about \"the appetizers taking more time to cook.\" This was not True because two tables who came after us got their food first. After this, our waitress mysteriously disappeared and another took her place. There was also no apology from the manager.  Overall, the food was mediocre in taste and presentation. It was not worth the $15-20 per entree. I had the Dan Dan noodles, which was bland (lacking spice and the ma la- numbing heat) and more like a soup than the authentic version.   I cannot recommend this restaurant because of the terrible service and high price for mediocre food. Take your business somewhere else.",

Large facility located near the check-in desk of the Bellagio. The smells walking in were incredible! Ordered the shrimp pad thai and mango rice pudding. Pad Thai was good, not great. Huge portions, couldn't finish it all but also couldn't take a box around the casinos with me so I paid $20 for half a plate of noodles. Rice pudding was perfect: perfect temp, not too sweet, fresh mango. However $8 is too much for the small portion size. They came around several times with a dim sum cart but was not clear on the pricing so did not order any.   The decor was very cool with jars of dried noodles lining the walls. Friendly service. Would return.",

    "text": "This was a goat rodeo. People were running around without purpose, phones were ringing unanswered, and the line looked more like a waddle of penguins all huddled against the elements while roosting on their eggs. There were about six places in line ahead of us, so maybe 25 people total. There were two of us for lunch and we didn't feel the need for the full \"Noodles experience.\" Based on other reviews here, we wouldn't be missing much. We just wanted a relatively quick meal that didn't break the bank, although a glance at the menu told me it wasn't exactly cheap. As we stood there for around 15 minutes and noticed the line wasn't budging, I went in the restaurant to see if they had a bar. They did, and there were about 4 or 5 seats open at it. Generally, you can go seat yourself at bars and get service from there, but this place seemed so disorganized and chaotic I thought it might be best to check with the hostess. I use that title lightly, as it implies the person is both female and does hosting. She was female, but no hosting was taking place. Not a shred of courtesy, eye contact, or even acknowledging anyone was standing in front of her. I stood there for like 5 minutes to try and ask if the bar was self seating or if they did things unlike most restaurants I've been in. I finally gave up and went back to the line. The other person in my party went to speak with the \"host\"ess and was able to get her attention. Not sure how she managed that, but she did it. She was told the seats at the bar are not self-seating and that they would be offered to the people in line in the order we were standing. That seems equitable, if a little unorthodox. The \"host\"ess asked everyone in line ahead of us, and even the people behind us, if they wanted the seats. No one accepted, so she seemingly reluctantly asked us. We accepted her most generous invitation and started moving toward the door. As we did, she dismissed us back to the line and told us the people ahead of us changed their minds and wanted the seats, after all. If they passed on the seats and we agreed to take them, we should have gotten them.   We ended up at a buffet, which should have been our first choice, in hindsight. They had Asian food there, too. And it was good.",

Look for the Bacharat sign above you and slots and a few tables...right ahead of you will be the elevators up to the hotel. The restaurant is right in between.   We ordered the pad Thai with tofu. It was not made with the thin pad Thai noodles, instead they used chow fun noodles. It was basically chow fun with lime and crushed peanuts. The veggie spring rolls were good.

We had the shrimp dumplings, shrimp balls, wonton noodle soup and the beef with black pepper/aspargus.  The beef was very good, the other foods were average.  Probably would not go back based on how many other choices there are in Vegas.",

Fushion of chinese and korean. We had crab fried rice - nicely flavored and not overpowering as to go with any dish you have.  Sweet and sour chicken - great flavor but neither too aour nor too sweet...it was very tender too.  Beef broccoli was out of this world...the depth of beef flavor in the sauce with sweetness and these was either cognac or aomething that made it stand out in your mouth..not like any other in Hawaii, California, Vegas or in Chinatown in Japan or Korea.....lol haven\"t been to China....will always make this a stop in vegas",

We had something called \"Double Happiness\" and you pick 2 of the 4 small a-la-carte items.  We chose BBQ Pork & Duck with a side of white rice.  Wonderful and easily enough for 2 on a casual late night dinner.  Give them a try, you'll like it.",

I got the Penang fried noodles and it was way too salty with very little meat. The presentation looked bad. My cousin also ordered the same dish as I did. It looked like the chef only made one dish and split it into two plates. Our parents ordered the varieties of meat and veggies. Everything tasted either salted or bland. The portion was way too small and yes it was very expensive.  Please everyone don't waste your time and money coming here. If you are craving for Chinese food in Vegas, please go someone where else. Drive to Chinatown area which is minutes away from the strip go get better food for cheaper.",

The food however was not what I expected for the price I'm paying.  The beef stew noodles was was good, but for a price of $18 I was expecting royal portion on a gold plated bowl.  The stir fry udon was decent, because it's lacking the wok flavor that a typical Asian stir fry noodles would have, so basically it's like eating smoked ribs without the smoke flavor.  The one that was not as bad was the wanton noodles, it was quite good and all the flavors were there, moreover the wantons looks made in-house.    Because I only visit LV for a few days, I would not recommend Noodles. But I would totally recommend when it's past 12am and not a lot of places are open.",

In my 5 days in Bellagio, I ate there 4 times. Two soups and two main courses were the best I ever had in that style. For the first time in my life I asked to thank the chef personally. It's not a what you call a 'traditional' Asian cuisine, if there is such a thing, it's more on a fusion side of things. And it is priced like it is in a very busy hotel in a middle of Las Vegas strip, which it is. But compared to other food joints in Bellagio, it's almost affordable.",

But it's a restaurant in the Bellagio so that comes with the territory. Also, the service we had was great, I would say even on par with the other \"fancier\" restaurants we ate at in the Bellagio.  Don't come here expecting a quick and cheap meal but come here if you're looking for a tasty and quick meal.

I consider our experience a lesson in not choosing restaurants due to lack of nearby options or nostalgia.    We ordered the Hainan chicken, ate some of the white meat, and then noticed that the dark meat was a color that we had not seen from chicken before -- like a muddy gray. I pointed it out to the waitress, and she offered to replace the chicken but at that point, I thought it was kind of risky. She gave us a mango pudding and an ice tea to go, which was nice but still not worth the $20 plus dollars we paid for the dish.   The oxtail soup was kind of a joke.  The soup was the standard dark broth you get when ordering beef brisket noodle soup.    The pork lo mein was overly drenched in sauce.  There are a lot of options in Las Vegas, so I feel like we wasted money and an opportunity to eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "If you have ever stayed in Bellagio or passed through its casino floors, you probably have seen a line forming outside this restaurant at any given time.  These anxious people know a secret: Noodles is home to the best authentic wonton-mein soup outside of Hong Kong and Toronto.  I have been to this Chinese-American-operated restaurant approximately 12 times in the last 5 years; and, its quality has not degraded since my inauguration.  The broth of its wonton-mein is delicate (not salty) and its fresh thin egg noodle is firm with the perfect starch-egg ratio taste that melts away in your mouth.    To complement this dish, I recommend their quarter roasted duck.  While it is on the expensive side, their tender dark meat selection is usually outstanding and beautifully cooked, leaving a nice crispy skin.  The duck comes with their bone neatly trimmed off; however, you can request for the bones should you want to extract some its flavors by dipping its caramelized seasoning into your soup as some people do.    The other selections on Noodles' extensive menu are very good but not spectacular save for the delicious oxtail soup.  Though the dim sum here is usually excellent, especially the gorgeous Shanghai dumpling and the siu mai, there have been two occasions where these selections have failed me.    The service here is usually quick and fast like most Chinese restaurants in New York, San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto, or LA.  The wait staff is straight-forward and no-nonsense; and, the hosts are friendly and efficient even when the line is 10 parties deep.    As mentioned by another reviewer, I would not order any beverages here other than tea.  The sodas do not come with refills.  I personally recommend their Jasmine Pearl tea, which comes in a porcelain pot.  But, no matter what you order, you must try what many people love about this restaurant: the wonton-mein soup.",

    "text": "EXTREMELY disappointed.   Located in Bellagio, we came here for a quick bite to eat around lunch time. There were several Chinese people in front of us, so figured we couldn't go wrong here!  I am not sure where people are getting the large portion size and great price. I agree with some of the other people in which the portion size was measly, and the price is outrageous for the portion size you get.   First of all, I have never been charged for hot tea at a dim sum place. We ordered the Homemade Garlic Ginger Sauce (Deep Fried) Chilean Sea Bass, which tasted great, but was gone in like three bites since it was so tiny. AND, we paid $33 for this tiny thing.   I can't remember what else I ordered or ate since the check was outrageous for the amount of food we got. Completely overpriced, and I would not recommend this place to anybody. You might as well eat at a cheap Chinese buffet like 6 times for the price and food you get.",

    "text": "Really really enjoyed the food here!!! One of the more authentic asian restaurants in Vegas too. We originally went to Bellagio to try out their lunch buffet, but after seeing how long the line extended out, we opt to try Noodles instead and it definitely did not disappoint.   We were practically starving by the time we got seated...after a night out of drinking, I usually feel like I could devour an entire cow the next morning lol. We sat down and immediately started ordering the dim sum for appetizers. Had the Siu mai and ha cao, along with many other authentic dishes and let me tell you - we were shocked on how delicious it was! Fresh tasting, and seasoning and flavors were simply delish!  For my main meal, I had the Hainan Chicken with Rice and the BF had the Roasted Duck with Rice. Almost all the others had some type of noodle soup with either chicken or duck. Food was pretty good, and although a little more pricey than other asian restaurants, it was worth it. Will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Well, fiddlesticks: inconsistency is never a good thing at a restaurant. That's why people (not me, but some) eat P.F. Chang's. They know what they're getting.   After our most recent delicious plate of snow peas, we decided to return, and this time, the snow peas were missing that addictive flavor. They weren't as sweet, nor as seasoned with wok-iness. I ate them, but I wasn't compelled to eat them faster than my husband to ensure I had more (which I did last time!). We also ordered a noodle dish, and it seemed a tad dry although the flavor was solid. I still think the nice sized, $4 miso soup is a good value on the Strip, but it doesn't have seaweed. Still, for $4 it is a cheap way to sustain yourself!  So, this update is here to say depending on who's in the kitchen, you may have a 3-star meal or a 4-star meal, but I still think the key is going for the cheaper stuff!",

I've dined here 2x - once for dinner and once for lunch, both times were on a weekend.  I'm not sure if they serve dim sum (in carts) for lunch every day but they do on Saturdays.  You have the option to order dim sum as appetizers regardless of day or time but be prepared to pay more than usual.  After all, we are at the Bellagio and not some random strip mall.    During the weekend lunch, while they're pushing carts, the dim sum rates aren't bad at all.  They're actually quite reasonable.  However, if you opt to get dim sum as appetizers in an \"off peak\" time then it will cost 2 to 3 times as much. My fiance and I ordered dim sum, as appetizers, during dinner and paid ~$8 per order.  The Malaysian Fried Rice w/Beef and Hong Kong Egg Noodles w/Shrimp are delicious!  I LOVE the Congee here. Surprisingly enough I didn't indulge in a noodle soup both times I dined here.  In fact, I only returned a 2nd time to have more porridge.  Their entrees are plentiful and great for sharing.   The staff was very friendly and food came out quick!",

After walking around the hotel we settle on eating at The Noddle.  I must admit the food was a lot better than I expected.  I ordered the shrimp pad thai.  The dish was very ,very good; much better than I expected for a strip Asian restaurant.  My friends ordered a couple of different soup/noodle dishes.  They were also goo, but the beef was slightly over-cooked.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  This was a great place to eat after all the exploring and people watching on the strip!",

I don't know why the duck tasted like chicken and the chicken  was overcooked and the dark meat texture was like really tough chicken breast meat. Then they managed to make the beef rice noodles taste burnt which is the resulting taste if one doesn't wash the wok after cooking for a long period of time. The Singapore curry rice noodles still had some bits and chunks of curry powder with every bite. You know, for a place called \"Noodles,\" the noodles were not good. The name really doesn't help.   So we asked for the bill.. My friend was thinking about doing some quick shopping before her flight, but I guess that's not part of the plan anymore..

The Good: Fried shrimp balls, tasty pork dumplings, chicken buns, extensive menu and lightning fast service. These ladies (and gents) don't waste any time getting you fed. If you're not a starvin' Marvin, Noodles is a great choice to dip into some Dim Sum.   The Meh: For not a ton of food (dim sum included), hubs and I still spend $60 on lunch. Plus, some of dishes could have used a bit more flavor - including the shrimp shu mai and steamed veggies. I was reaching for the chili sauce quite a bit to add some kick.  Overall, not a bad spot to grab a fast bite...just be prepared to pay for it, literally!",

After all it's in a fancy upscale hotel so she needs to drop that low class attitude and step up her classy manner. I don't go there and pay for the over price Chinese food to get the poor attitude that I can get from other good Chinese restaurants that serve better food.   I ended up ordering the ox tail soup anyway cuz I needed something hot for the cold day. It was good but I have had better in Hawaii.",

They are either flavourless like our garlic stir fried vegetables and the pho beef noodle soup, or super salty for our Chinese bbq, hainam chicken and a few appetisers. They have the most saltiest bbq pork I have ever exp.   Go there for the close proximity and the convenience if you are staying in the hotel, avoid it at all cost if you are looking for good Chinese food.",

    "text": "We were hungry. It was Saturday evening. We didnt wanna wait in a long line and we wanted to stay on Bellagio property. Noodles to the rescue... Or so we thought. I thought it was just ok. I definitely expected more but having grown up on authentic Chinese cooking in San Francisco and living in Los Angeles as an adult, with all the options there, I should have known better. Noodles was just an americanized version of Asian cooking.  I was starved so I went with the $30.88 prix fixe menu. Probably my first mistake... Ha! I chose the wonton soup over the miso. It was just ok. The broth was fine to me but others at our table thought it was too salty. The wontons were filled with shrimp and were just ok. It was on the bland side for me, as far as the dumplings go.  For the appetizer, I ordered the pan fried potstickers (gyoza) over the spring rolls. I love gyoza and you get 3 pieces in this order. They were fried just right and were filled with pork and vegetables. The dipping sauce was tasty. Sad to say that these pot stickers were the highlight of my meal at Noodles.  For the entree, I chose chicken chow mein. You can choose between chicken, beef, bbq pork or shrimp for this dish. I had visions of Hong Kong style thin and crispy chow mein noodles like I am used to eating at Asian cafes in San Gabriel Valley. Nope... Not even close. What I got were big, wide egg noodles that were rather tasteless. Definitely not what I wanted or expected. It was a huge serving and I hated to waste the food so I just tried to eat all the chicken pieces of the dish. Yeah, it was that tasteless to me. I had to add soy sauce.... That should tell you something. The other entree options were pad thai or sweet & spicy noodles. The same meats I listed above are the options for those dishes as well.    Service was good. Our waitress was nice and our drinks were refilled almost immediately... The food just wasnt up to expectations. Especially considering that its located inside Bellagio. It should be better. And with what we got, it should have been much less expensive than we paid. It wasnt worth the $30 price for all 3 dishes served...",

Originally, we were going for a simple \"beef chow fun\"!  What came out was a soy sauce gravy chow fun.....gross! \"Shelly\" (our waitress) came to the table and asked how everything was (for this dish, we had already waited 20mins for it to arrive to the table and it was inedible)!   Shelly did take it back and suggested another \"type\" of chow fun; this time, it was inedible and \"spicy\".....we barely touched it and the bill came to the table!  We again told her that it was \"nasty\" & to that response, she said she would talk to the manager......only to not be seen for another 10mins while she talked to the manager!  She returned to the table after asking her \"what happened\"......& Shelly said they had sold 10-12 of these dishes without complaint throughout dinner service......there's nothing they could do to help us!  It wasn't like we were asking for the whole dinner to be comp'd but to put something out there that you couldn't eat at such a nice resort was so egregious.    The quality of food and service (if I could) would be a -5 Star; to hotel management, you should take a look at their personnel and management because (well).....they make Bellagio look bad!",

The kung pao was mildly on the sweet side, a little bland.. The pineapple fried rice was good but could use more spice, the flat noodles was decent, again no specific taste.

    "text": "Noodles is apparently \"known\" for its noodles and dim sum. Psht dim sum, more like dim a lot(of money) [sorry bad pun].   Anyways, the decoration of the place was pretty cool and unique. Noodles everywhere! The service was interesting. It took our server 15minutes to realize that we were sitting at our table. After swinging our arms and giving her the head nod. The hostess finally went to get her. (-1 star) When she got to us, she was friendly and even spoke Chinese, which I guess is a plus if you can't speak English.   To the food: we ordered the premium fried rice, some kind of soba noodle soup, beef noodle soup, duck egg congee, crab meat vermicelli noodles, a few dim sum items.   Hold on to your hats, I'm going to do a quick run through of everything.   Premium fried rice: contains pineapples. Has a sweet taste. However very dry, so I'm assuming they used fresh cooked rice, making the fried rice dry. Tasted like nothing to me. L  Soba noodle soup: tastes like sake.  Beef noodle soup: good soup base, but there was not enough soup. The beef was well cooked, so it was soft and it easily \"melted\" in your mouth. The egg noodles did not match the taste of the beef noodle soup. The noodles tasted like flour to me.  Congee: tasted pretty good, the chicken had no taste.  Vermicilli noodles: crab meat was dry. Dish was okay but really salty for my taste.   Dim sum: it was dim sum but it wasn't with like 9-11$ for a plate. Haha.  Overall, if you're craving Asian and are too lazy to walk into the hell wrath heat outside, go here. Otherwise I don't recommend. :)",

They serve a little of everything. From Singaporean Noodles, pad Thai, to pho and udon noodle soup, this place really has quality food. Yes, the price is higher but you can't really expect Vegas food to come cheap to begin with. My favorite dishes here at the crabmeat vermicelli, the congee(rice is super fine and smooth), and the hainan chicken rice. I've also tried the dim sum items but I wouldn't really come here for that. The dim sum options and taste really lack. I wasn't very impressed. Other than that, order off the menu and you won't be disappointed. I would say for the noodle soup and congee options, it's definitely a one person kind of portion. However, the fried rice or pan fried noodles are made for sharing family style. Be prepared to have a lot food!",

The casual eatery has a large selection of dishes to choose from. I recommend picking something with noodles, hence the name. I had gotten the wonton noodles before, and it was pretty good after adding some salt. I also recommend the Thai iced tea.   Unfortunately, today I ordered the Hainanese chicken with bones in, and this was the worst I have had. The chicken tasted a bit funky and was very salty. The soup that came with the dish was salty too, but it tasted ok after eating the chicken. That's how salty the chicken was. It overpowered everything. The side sauces were nothing special just minced ginger, chili, and soy sauce. I had to ask for a sweet chili sauce to make the chicken more bearable. The fragrant rice that came with the chicken was the only good part of the dish. It costs around $22 too!   Overall, come here for the wide variety of Asian food and stick with noodles. The menu has traditional Mandarin too for those who like a Mandarin menu. This is also a good choice if you're dining alone since there's a row of individual seating on a low bar style area.",

I don't know if I should consider that a good thing because I generally like pad see ew better, or a bad thing, because they basically didn't get the pad thai right. The noodles also had many hard as rock parts.",

It seemed like smiling was frowned upon because we didn't get one smile the whole time from all the waiters and waitresses. 4 of us and one person didn't get their food because they forgot. They didn't apologize for it being 30 Min after the rest of us got our food and neither compensated us for the meal for the inconvenience. The head host was unfazed by anything and almost like they didn't care whether they had a customer or not. Definitely not how to run a business! Would not recommend anyone in their right state of mind to go there. Stick to anything else!",

Skip the dessert, so not worth it. We ordered 2 orders of sticky rice with mango (they did not use the right type of mango), it tasted weird. 2 small scoop of strawberry sorbet was $10.  Overall, the experience was meh. The curry noodles was the best part of the meal. Everything else including service was mediocore, expected of chinese restaurant.    I would have given it a 3 stars had it not been so expensive. $19.50 for a bowl of seafood pho.  Omg!  If you want to charge that much for food, service should be better.   Where i'm from that pho bowl would be less than half that price and taste way better. I guess we are in Vegas and rent is expensive but wow!",

(I know I know, it's all expensive now on the Strip, but seriously... $18 for chow mein... $24 for kungpao shrimp... $21 for hainan chicken?) But in my eyes, for anyone to grab five stars their food has to be exemplary and/or at a great price for what you get... Don't get that here, but don't get me wrong; I dine here at least once each time I get to Vegas. It's my go-to when I need my Chinese fix. At least they don't charge for hot tea (like that Chinese place in the MGM does....) They're not WAY overpriced for what you get, and the price won't stop me from getting my hainan and pei dan jook.  Oh, and a last note, I don't know what that person is saying about how they wish it was more authentic...... It's pretty authentic to the stuff that we have back home.   Eat their jook, and not everything is outrageously overpriced, but when in Vegas, c'est la vie! Satisfy that craving!  ----  EDIT: btw, whoever keeps complaining about how overpriced and everything is probably doesn't gamble at bellagio with their $25 table minimum, or cries over having gambled away their $100 fortune.... i'm just saying. yes, i am chinese. yes, the price makes me cringe sometimes. and i realize even i took away a star for it, but i admit i am one of those who cries over that $100 i lost and i steer clear away from those $25 tables. but if you're going to focus so much on it why the heck are you even in vegas? for their really overpriced shows?? sorry, it's late and i just got done reading post after post about how expensive the food is and comparing Noodles to some hole in the wall. go to chinatown if you want and know that's where you'll get chinatown-priced chinese food. how about instead of croaking on about it on a bellagio restaurant, you praise that chinatown locale instead? gaaaahhhhh appreciate, don't hate!",

Waited a few minutes for a table and got seated relatively quickly.  We have heard how great this place is, how their beef stew noodle is great, and etc.  So we ended up eating and my dad had Taiwanese beef stew and my mom had the won ton soup.  Both agreed it was good and portions were generous.  The gf had congee which was average and I had the hainan chicken rice which was disappointing.  Rice was dry, chicken just didn't look fresh, and then I thought to myself why did I order rice in a place that is named noodles?  Man I really missed out on that one.  So the next night after happy hour, we came back again.  And honestly speaking this place is probably the least expensive place you'll find in Bellagio.  We ordered noodles, fried rice, greens, roti naan bread, century egg, cucumber salad, and bbq pork/chicken.  Why did we order the chicken after seeing how it was last night?  No idea but even though it was a different kind of chicken it wasn't a winner winner.  The bbq pork was much better than the chicken and better than a lot of places in SF.  The fried rice, eh, it was okay, not great but not bad.  The roti naan bread passed, the century egg was okay (not a big fan), and the cucumber salad was too sweet.  The greens and the noodles (see?) were the winners.    We actually ate a lot as the portions are generous.  Would I come back?  Even though I'm giving it three stars, I enjoyed the restaurant very much.  Service was great, decor is nice, maybe I was just happy eating out late with my parents like when I was young but I would come back because for a five star hotel restaurant the pricing isn't that bad.",

Some may argue that this is common in beef noodle soup, but being from Taiwan (a place where beef noodle soup is extremely popular) I'm not a huge fan of this type of soup. All-in-all I still enjoyed the dish, the beef chunks and tendons were nice.  The seafood pho my mom ordered was also plain, although my mom liked it.   On our second visit I had the Dan Dan noodles while my mother ordered the Hainanese chicken rice and a side of Shu Mai. While I'm not an expert at either of the main dishes, I quite enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles; they reminded me of tasty dry noodles with sauce that I used to have as a kid living in Taipei. I would have preferred if there was more soup; the noodles were really taking up the small bowl and sucking up most of the soup.   The chicken rice, on the other hand was not so good. The rice itself was dry, and everything else about the dish was mediocre. The Shu Mai were dry and average-tasting as well.  Still, Noodles isn't all that bad for a quick bite of Asian food; it gets the job done.  Taking into consideration that the type of food Noodles serves is - to my knowledge - quite rare in Vegas, it might deserve a 3.5.",

We had:  Laksa Curry Noodle - good flavor, but portion was small and it wasn't that exciting.  Barbecue Rice - rice was lose and the barbecue pork wasn't tender and wasn't that flavorful.  Water Spinach with Belachan chili - our favorite dish. It's \"kangkong\" with shrimp paste and thai chili. It was really good and probably the most authentic dish.   I don't usually comment on service, but our older male server was the best! He was so nice, hardworking and friendly - he definitely made up for the disappointing food.",

Peopel head of us told us, its there 3rd time at the place, so we got good feeling about the place.   I oder the fried rice, Kung Pao Shrimp, Fried Rice and Singapore Curry Rice Vermicelli with Shrimp and told our server to make it medium spicy, boy it hit the spot.  It was great chinese food. Loved it.   Only reason i am giving it 4 stars becuase our server was little sleepy, other then that ambiance was great very contemporary dining.",

    "text": "Noodles (the food) are great for a hangover, and it is tough to visit Vegas without ending up with a hangover at some point.  I wandered the strip for hours looking for just the right thing to cure my previously over-indulgent night, and was about to break down and eat just about anything, when I remembered the curative properties of a bowl of noodle soup.  I broke out my trusty iPhone and yelp app, and narrowed it down to Noodles (the restaurant), which was closest to my current location.  Noodles is right off the Casino in The Bellagio, but has neither that crowded casino feel, nor that high end, 'I am going to get fleeced' feel.  Pleasant contemporary decor, with a lot wood, and a not-too-crowded-or-noisy atmosphere made me feel immediately comfortable.  The Dim Sum cart was making rounds, so I tasted a few basic dumplings, all pretty solid.  Followed that up with a bowl of wonton noodle soup.  It was served piping hot, and the dumplings were tasty.  Overall, it was pretty good, although the broth was not incredibly flavorful.  It went down quite well with the Asahi Super Dry beer.  All in all, I was pretty satisfied...just what the doctor ordered.  It was mildly expensive for a quick lunch, but the service was great, and it hit the spot.  Other dishes I saw coming out looked delicious, and were huge portions.  So much so that the girls sitting next to me at the sushi-bar style counter offered to share some of their food, but I was already stuffed by then.  I would definitely go back, and probably would have rated 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed that, but they just don't quite rank a 4 star rating.  I will try them again some day, and maybe grant that extra star.",

I know this is silly, but the water at Bellagio tasted so good compared to any other restaurant on the strip of Vegas. We are from Denver and I have to say Denver water is delicious, especially compared to Vegas water. Anyway, the food was terrific and the service was also very good, they refilled our glasses, which I noticed several other restaurants did not do. The food also came out very promptly. The bowls/portions looked small, but definitely offered a lot food. The only unfortunate thing is that they do not do refills on sodas! Only ice tea, but like I mentioned before, water was good!",

The portions are small compared to your typical chinese restaurants. We were there with six in our party and we order five dishes. Two noodle dishes, one fried rice, one meat and one tofu dish. Thinking that this should be plenty of six people as one order is most chinese restaurants if far more food than can be eaten by one person,  but we polished off everything and could have eaten a sixth dish but we had a show to catch so we decide not to add anything. We ate around 6 pm and no line to be seated but when we left there was a line of around 20 people. The restaurant is small  and decor is interesting with the bottles of dried food items on one wall and the other wall had these rope wall hangings that seem out of place for a chinese restaurant .  Nevertheless it is probably the lowest priced place for dinner in Bellagio where you can get dinner for $20/person. Basically it was okay but have to rate it down due to the price and portion size. But if you are staying Bellagio and do not want to haul everyone to another hotel this is not a bad option.",

The noodles were...well...noodles; There was only one piece of beef chuck and the rest were tendons; And the soup had a nice kick (hits the spot after a nasty hangover).

I'm chinese so I can tell you that this food is authentic.  It's real hard for me to find authentic chinese food in Louisiana... I usually have to go to Houston.  All we have here is so-call chinese food thats not at all authentic.  I like noodles because they have a variety of asian food.  They have dim sum, thai food, chinese food, vietnamese food, and... not really sure what else... but there was a lot of choices.  I got this chinese veggie thats only cooked in authentic places and it was great.  I did get the porridge one morning and did not like the side plates.  I wanted some sour things to put in it... I thought they were going to be the usual authentic sour radish and so forth that we make at home.  Instead it was this pickled cucumber from a can. on the weekends they have dim sum.  You can tell its good b/c this is one of the few places you actually see old asian people come eat.  You know a place is authentic when there's a bunch of old chinese women there.  I also like noodles because they were opened very late.",

Although I agree that their prices are high I think it's still worth it.  I eat here regularly when I an in Las Vegas, 4-5 times a year, and I've never had a bad dish.  The service can get slow at times if you wait for them to come to you, but remember this is a Chinese restaurant, just wave at them or call out to them and they come over right away.  I've had a variety of dishes here and the food is always fresh, well prepared and you get plenty.  I like their roast duck.  I always order it boneless, this way I get breast meat which I think is the best part.  I could go on and on but I don't like witting long reviews.  Again, the prices are not that bad for Las Vegas.",

The food was abundant; I had a full plate and as starving as I was, could not finish it. The noodles were very delicious though, and the chicken was tender. The sauce/glaze...i don't now what it was but after I added some of that spicy sauce (i'm thinking it was just Rooster sauce) It became relevant to future stays in Vegas, repeat business status.

Very few restaurants can manage that consistency. I highly recommend the pad thai (they make it with wide rice noodles) and green tea ice cream for desert.

Their straight forward menu and service lends itself to be a clutch late night spot. Hainanese Chicken was perfectly oily, the prata was flaky and gooey, the char siu pau was superbly steamed you could take a nap on its pillow-y top, shiu mai was plump and juicy, the hot and spicy cucumbers are made in house and just right when paired with the Hong Kong noodles or Mandarin Beef Stew.   I know my southeast asian cuisine fairly well, and love it more than the rest of the world's fare,  but I am not afraid to admit that I'm not with the experienced majority, however I can lend my thoughts on the food to be taste-opening and wholesome.

Most of the food served there is made to share for the whole table so the price may seem expensive but for the amount of food you get, its not that bad. Also, make sure to try the Thai iced tea, it is delicious!",

I ordered noodle soup with chicken and my sister got the Mandarin beef stew noodle. Both were huge portions and incredibly hearty and delicious. The broth was flavored very well and the meat was super tender. Also once we finally sat down the service was very fast and friendly. It was seriously the best noodle soup we've ever had, and one of my best meals in Vegas. YUM!!!!",

The BBQ pork buns were the highlights - just the right amount of filling with the perfect amount of spice, encased in warm, fluffy buns. Dan Dan noodles were alright... Seemed to lack in flavor but we're pretty spoiled by the (amazing) Han Dynasty back in NYC so that might explain our 'meh' response to this place.   Overall, somewhat of a typical hotel joint kind of place. Can't complain, but wouldn't go out of our way to come back here again.",

The noodles were okay and the portion size was decent.   My wife had the sweet and sour shrimp, which was decent, on par with a chain like Pei Wei. Not great for $26.

    "text": "We were after a bit of lighter dinner after nearly two weeks of eating out on vacation, and were already at the Bellagio while waiting for the doors to open for O.  A quick scan of the restaurant offerings seemed to suggest that Noodles would hit the spot.  We ordered a pair of specialty cocktails, the steamed dumplings, the Szechuan Dan-Dan noodle soup and the Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup.  I had high hopes, given the decor of the restaurant and the emphasis on \"Authentic regional dishes from all over Asia\".    Food snob warning:  I have fond memories of Dan-Dan Noodle Soup from visiting Szechuan province, and there's a restaurant near my home that does a pretty accurate version.  I also make it pretty well myself.  It's not hard.  What I was served at Noodles compares only in name - the flavor of the broth was extremely muted and there was no measurable amount of heat to the dish.  It needed chili oil, and I tried to get some Szechuan chili oil from our server so I could fix it, but no can do - she said the kitchen doesn't have it.  Which seems odd, being that Szechuan chili oil is a key ingredient in this dish.  I'd liken it to serving pho without having Sriracha and hoisin sauce to dip the meat in.  It's edible, but would be missing an expected set of flavors.  After a little prodding, our server did bring out a dish of the house chili oil, which was chopped green/red jalapenos and garlic in vegetable oil.  It helped a little, but it doesn't exactly replace the complex flavors or the numbing sensation of Szechuan peppercorns.  The wife's Spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup was similarly bland and would have benefited from some additional fish sauce and Thai chili pepper.  She wasn't very happy either, but she doesn't feel a need to go off on a tirade about it.  That's my turf.  Authentic?  Not one bit. Palatable to the average American?  Sure.  I did get to pay more than 50 times what a bowl of Dan-Dan noodle soup costs on the streets of Chengdu, and almost twice what it costs at home. So it had that going for it at least.  ;)  I should have pulled the car from valet and driven to Chubby Cattle instead.  Oh well.",

The beef noodle is pretty good that the beef is really tender and well boiled. Also, you could add ducks and chashao for small dishes to save your dollars at a really late time.

It looked like the same quality food from a cheap Chinese buffet, but at $20 a plate for some noodles! The chicken in the pad Thai had a very strange texture and flavor. Inedible. The chow mein had NO flavor whatsoever even after my attempts to doctor it up with Chili sauce and pepper. I sent the dish back much to the dismay of our waitress. Two stars for edible dumplings.",

We told her we might want to try the cheaper alternative, but she said we would like the more expensive option more. I was hesitant but I was glad we did. Later in the night, she came over with free samples of the cheaper sake because she wanted us to compare. She was right. The one we ordered was much much better. We got sweet and spicy noodles with chicken to eat, so good! Noodles had a wonderful texture and the chicken was skinny and easy to eat.

My plate had two strips of bellpeppers while having 50 slices of pineapple. Rice was okay. I felt like it was on the dry side. I also had the wonton noodles... the broth was nothing special. Service was okay. The receipt recommended a gratuity tip but I was so disgusted by the food that I felt like tipping was robbing me more. If my bill came put to 18.50 dollars, I would have felt like I paid what the food is worth. I think people who gave this place more than one star don't have an idea what good chinese good is like.",

In my opinion, tough luck the seats were ours, the hostess thought otherwise and those nincompoops got the seats. Bummer. But after seeing the rest of the reviews on Yelp, maybe we dodged a bullet.

    "text": "Noodles will always have a special place in my heart~they were around the strip longer than the other new Asian places in the MGM properties. Used to cure my hung overs with Pho here with dim sum on many occasions.  Food is pan Asian - menu is consisted of dimsum,  appetizers,  noodles (pan/stir fried & soup), vegetables, fried rices, bbq dishes (duck, chicken, pork), other entree dishes with different proteins (fish, shrimp, chicken, pork, & beef), & congee. Who are we kidding? Most of the dish on their menu items are low cost budget eats else where yet we probably pay at least 30% or more just because they're located inside Bellagio hotel. Well, I guess we will pay for the convenience and fancy factor - at least the service is better than your average dimsum joint! So if you are not feeling little too hung over and need a soothing soup remedy - your best option would be the Noodles (if you're staying at Bellagio that is). If you don't feel like paying the price - you know you're only 3 miles away from Vegas China Town. Just need to deal with crazy traffic on Vegas Blvd to and from the hotels not to mention parking again! Well, there's Uber too~ ^_^",

All of that was about a 3.5 star. But here's the kicker, the kimchi was terrible. I mean it is so old and fermented they should be ashamed of theirselves. It was inedible and honestly about 60+days old. When we gave feedback to take the dish back, we actually got an attitude from the server and the manager. Don't be offended, just take the dish back, offer a replacement or just take it off the bill. Too easy right? And last throw all that out and make some more. For $7 I could buy a whole jar freshly made.",

Duck and pork weren't quite up to the standards of authentic Chinese food I've had in the Bay Area.  However, the service was great.

The environment was very upscale of course being inside of Bellagio. Love the orange and red interior.Ordered pot stickers, egg noodles and shrimp balls. If you're staying at Bellagio, and your looking for Asian food and don't want to leave the hotel its great! The convenience factor is amazing since its right on the casino floor. Also its great, if you had just come from the pool because the dress requirement is better than grabbing food from the convenience store and not as upscale as some of the restaurants inside the casino.",

When he understood what I was doing he offered the perfect dish with a tasty sauce and a tofu and noodle dish that was unlike anything I've ever had before.

I always order the same thing but it's a good combination and I can't seem to stray from it.  Edamame is nothing special, but at $7.50 it's probably one of the most expensive edamames out there.  Spicy Cucumber is really really good too.  It's more like a Korean kimchee style and I don't get how they get the cucumber so consistantly  crunchy, sweet, and spicy but again, it's expensive..  I think it was about $7 or $8 for a SIDE DISH..    My favorite all-time dish here is the braised beef & tendon soup with egg noodles.  The meat is cook well and is very tender, the egg noodles are thin and delicate, a really good combination, but the broth is a little too soy saucey.

    "text": "Between 2 and 4 stars, so it averages to a 3.   What was 2 stars?  The service, the price, and the food.  The 2 star service was mostly how we ordered a Diet Coke and a Coke and we got two Diet Cokes and how they brought out a noodle soup dish first and then the other three fried noodle dishes about 10-15 minutes later.  The price was a bit much for what you get, although it wasn't unexpected in Vegas, let alone the Bellagio.  But seriously, it's noodles.  The dish probably costs $2 to make and is usually marked up to $6 or $8 at a normal restaurant....but $15 or $20 here?  Pffffft.  That's what I have to say about that.  The 2 stars for food is for the upset stomach about 20 minutes after leaving.    The 4 stars were for the service and the food.  The service was great because no matter how fast I drank my drink, it was rarely empty and when it was, it didn't stay empty for long.  I got the spicy dan dan noodles which turned out to be pretty tasty.  The ground pork could have been any cut and didn't have much flavor.  The spiciness was on the very low side so I had to add a lot of the chili sauce they have on the table.  I got to try some of the fried noodle dishes and they seemed pretty similar to each other.  But the flat Thai-style noodles were pretty tasty.   Overall, this restaurant is just okay.  It's the budget Bellagio meal and it honestly doesn't feel like it belongs in the casino.  I think that was because the ingredients are cheap to begin with and the menu was mostly stocked with the standard Asian dishes you can find anywhere else in the country.  There were some interesting things, I'll admit, but for the most part I've seen it all before.  This sentiment would probably be different if they had something like chicken feet in the dim sum menu, but alas.  If you don't want to spend a lot for food, I'd suggest walking somewhere else, you'll get more bang for your buck.

He was talking with them for a while so he didn't give our order to the kitchen right away. They brought out our calamari appetizer first, then the dim sum maybe 10 minutes later, and then we didn't get our next dish until 20 minutes after that. Our waiter also told us that someone else would be helping us instead of him but he didn't say who and we had no idea which person to ask. We got the rest of our food rather quickly but by the time we were done it had been almost an hour and a half since we came in. Two groups who came in after us had received their food before we got most of ours and they left before we did. For whatever reason, the kitchen was taking a long time to prepare our food.",

    "text": "UGH!! Worst mistake ever! We arrived to the restaurant Noodles in Bellagio in hopes of getting something yummy to eat. However, it was a bad gamble. When we got there for lunch, there was a line and we waited about 30 minutes. We thought, \"Hmm, since there is a line, it must be somewhat decent.\" Boy, were we wrong!!   We finally got seated and we saw the dim sum carts and ordered some dim sum. We ordered sui mai, pork ribs, and dumplings. They were EXTRA SMALL and a bit on the dry side. I love my sui mais moist and juicy!!  Okay okay...enough about the dim sum. On to the main course now. My hubby  ordered the seafood pho that was TWENTY DOLLARS and I ordered congee (rice porridge) with pickled veggies, even that was overpriced.   Don't get me wrong, if the food was worth all that money, I wouldn't complain. The Pho came out in this extra tiny bowl! I mean, it was a small bowl, like those Asian soup bowls that we all have in our home. The Pho was bland and they only give you 3 measly shrimps and few slices of ODENG (fish cakes). REALLY? THAT's SEAFOOD PHO!! So disappointing. Now,  onto my dish. The congee wasn't anything special. The pickled radish was whatever too, nothing special.   It really wasn't that great. I rather would have gone to Monte Carlo to their Asian noodle house instead. They have better size portions (u can definitely share) and better price.   BTW, my hubby got sick after few bites of his food. Not that I'm saying it was the food that actually got him sick. He could have been sick from the disappointment of the food here at Noodles. ;)",

Once seated, we started with cocktails. My tangerine mojito was delicious and one of the top 5 mojitos I've ever had (and, believe me, I have sampled a lot of mojitos!). My brother had the Funky Monkey which was a banana-y pina colada concoction that was delivered in a plastic coconut shell. My dad stuck with a glass of New Zealand wine.  All of the different asian-y options on the menu looked delicious and tempting. We started with the vegetarian egg rolls and pork pot stickers. Both were hot, served with great sauces, and super. Next, we had the tom yum thai shrimp noodle soup. It was lighter than what we'd expected but yummy with lots of ginger and porcini mushrooms. Finally, we had the chicken pad thai, sweet and sour shrimp, and steamed vegetables. Recounting this, it sounds like a ton of food for 3 people (and I thought so at the time too) but we finished just about every last morsel. The portions were reasonable but not huge. The veggies were pretty ordinary and required soy sauce but the pad thai and sweet and sour shrimp were perfect! Now, my brother and I were fueled up for the night ahead at Tryst...",

They make you stand in line for over an hour with no pager or any other system which would allow the guests to sit in casino or do something else. Also none of the restaurants in Bellagio including Noodles has a couch or waiting area which would allow the patrons to sit. This reflects a very callous attitude by bellagio where they dont have a couch or a pager system.   The food is OK. The 2 table besides the counter in the back isclose toeach other and there is very little privacy...  So overall a very dissatisfying dinner - 45 min wait with no place to sit and wait,  food is Just vey average and the waiter is very abrupt so cant give any points for service either.",

My friends and I wanted something to eat...our hearts were AIMED at the BELLAGIO BUFFET. When we got there, the line was OUT OF THIS WORLD! SHIT...I guess BELLAGIO BUFFET would have to wait. In addition, we were in a bit of a time constraint...we only had 2 hour left before heading out to the MARQUEE nightclub. As we walked around confused...we searched for the CHEAPEST/MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK restaurant....eventually...we ended at NOODLES.  We checked out the menu...pretty cheap...especially for a VEGAS setting...and they have NOODLES! my favorite kind of food! The thing that stood out to me was their SEAFOOD PHO...with a whomping price of $18!!! HOLLLY COWWW.   Anywho...I ordered the BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND THE SPICY CUCUMBER.  -the spicy cucumber was interesting...the way I imagined it were smaller cuts of cucumber with some chili or some pepper looking item...instead it was a long look-alike cucumber with a sour and sweet taste....hmm I was confused...but whatever, maybe its been awhile since Ive had CHINESE food -then the BEEF NOODLE SOUP came out...wowww. It looked amazing. The food was good, the beef was guud...but the noodles....eh it was alright. I guess it was OK in a  VEGAS setting, but Ive def. had better.   Overall, the meal was satisfying and filling. I probably wont come out here again unless Im staying at the BELLAGIO.   UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

A friend had organized a little dim sum group outing here...glad she did!   We got there around 11am. There was already a line forming by the time we got there. Noodles only seats complete parties (and in some cases nearly complete parties if its reasonable that they will be there soon, like in our case). We were a group of 9. While we waited I took a shot at the Baccarat tables and learned a few things!   Dim sum was spot on. We had the following (ordering in multiple dishes):  - Shiu Mai, Cantonese style shrimp and pork dumplings steamed  - Pot Sticker, a Chinese staple. It tasted as good as actually being in Asia.  - Char Siu Pau, Steamed bbq pork buns, the kind that has the puffy white breading. It was great. Moist (as it should have been as it was steamed).  - Malaysian-Style Roti Prata, It is a pan fried flaky bread. Was really good and came with a better than reasonable curry sauce. Perhaps I was caught up in the moment.   - Roasted Pork, Was awesome....the name of the dish defines itself. prepared well. not too fatty though enough to keep it authentic.   Probably one of the few meals that didn't include alcohol...instead we had THAI ICE TEA!!!!! I found out it was on the menu and ordered one to complete the memories from Asia...and then after I got mine everyone else got one following my \"tastegasm\".  Towards the end of our meal my friend saw that legendary Poker Player Johnny Chan was eating a few tables away from us. He was apparently the Bellagio's resident poker player.   I will make a stop here again next time I am in town.",

It's not the best asian food around Vegas, and it's also not the cheapest.   The biggest disappointment with Noodles came after the food. Our friend got a severe allergic reaction to something she ate and upon calling Noodles, we received one of the worst customer service. They said they would send someone to check up on our friend, but no one ever came. It was a huge liability issue on their part, and we could've taken more action if we really wanted to.   NEVER AGAIN. Don't think we will be coming back here ever.",

After eating our appetizer which came out in a timely manner, we waited another 20 minutes for one of our two entrees.  While waiting, we noticed that there was a large Chinese family who sat 10 minutes after we did. They placed their order in their native tongue to the waitress and received all of their order. We were really disappointed, we had anticipated eating the sweet sour chicken with the chicken chow mein. Our waittress never came to apologize that the chicken chow mein wastaking longer than anticipated. When we brought it to the attention of the manager, she said some dishes take longer and my hubby pointed out that the Chinese family had chow mein orders, too, and she couldn't answer us!  So as we sat, we noticed that customers who spoke Chinese, had special treatment over other nationalities. We talked to a European couple next to us, and they had noticed the same trend. I would be interested to know if this happend to others?  OH, and the food??? I would give it 3 stars!! Had better, elsewhere!",

When I came to this restaurant with my family it took us 30 minutes before we got seated. First impression is the place is nice. Seats are unique and comfortable, and the spice jar decor is beautiful.   Service was a bit off, it took a while to get our drinks and a long time to get our order in. It was to the point where we drank all of our waters before ordering, and on top of that we didn't get a refill until our server took our order. We ordered our food and had mostly family style plates like noodles, duck, and beef dishes. For dessert we ordered their mango pudding. Their food was good, it's like any other local Chinese cuisine restaurant. Their mango pudding was the best I've eaten so far. I'll probably just come back for that. We got out bill, for about 4 mango puddings, and 3 dishes our bill came out to $85 with tax. They are very pricey. The price did not match the quantity they give and as for quality, their food tasted like your local Chinese restaurant cuisine... Noodles was a good experience but I won't ever dine here again because our monies weren't worth the service and taste of food we got. The mango pudding was the only good thing about this place!",

The food was bland, and the noodles didn't have the chewy texture I've become accustomed to in Dandan noodles. Also, the server warned me, something about something we ordered being spicy, but it wasn't. If I get warned about something that's spicy, I want heat. I want sweat.

    "text": "Noodles is located in the Bellagio. It's a pretty small restaurant and I can imagine the wait can be really long when it's busy.   The cost of the food was pretty pricey. My husband and I shared a prefixed menu that included soup, noodles, and dumplings. The prefixed menu cost $28 and you cannot do substitutions. For the soup, there was a choice of wonton soup or miso soup. The noodles choices included pad Thai, chow mein, and 2 other choices. The dumplings could be steamed or fried.    We got the wonton soup which was really delicious. It came with 4 shrimp wontons. For the noodles, we got the pad Thai with pork BBQ. You have the option of having it with shrimp, chicken or beef too. The pad Thai was a bit salty for me. The fried dumplings were good too. My sister ordered the chow mein and she said the noodles tasted really fresh.  The prefixed meal was plenty for me and my husband. We even had leftovers to box up.   The food was good but I'm not planning on coming back here the next time I go to Vegas. I'd go here if someone wanted to eat here, but I wouldn't be the one suggesting this place. It's pricey for average Chinese food.",

Of course it was not in there when I got to my room so I made another trip down. If that wasn't bad enough she wanted to argue that it was in the bag as she handed me the sauce as if she was doing me some kind of favor.

I have been dining here for 15 years, and can say this is my favorite Asian restaurant... and by Asian I mean they offer everything on their menu- Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese. All these years I have been secretly wishing one would appear in Orange County, but I guess perhaps I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I do if it was readily available every day (would break my Vegas ritual!). I am baffled that this place does not boast a 4-5 star average, as everything I have tried here is mouthwateringly delicious, and the quality of food is excellent-especially compared to other sub-par Asian eateries. You must try the Dim-Sum on the weekends (available till 3pm) as it is some of the best I've had (get the Shu Mai and Har Gow-YUM!). The hands down best dish is something I order EVERY time- the Soya Chicken (all white meat). You can order it as the Triple Happiness, served along with roasted duck and bbq pork, if you're in the mood for variety. I have eaten at a hundred Chinese restaurants in Southern California and I cannot find this dish anywhere else!! The chicken is so tender and flavorful (they will not tell you how they prepare it, which must be the secret) and it sits atop a delicate soy sauce broth that is perfectly salted. My husband has tried to recreate it at home but to no prevail. My other favorite is the Cantonese dumpling noodle soup. But literally everything on the menu is worth ordering and we have never been disappointed by the service. I hope this place never changes so that I can eat here for another 15 years! ;-)",

The food : steamed veggies were perfect, there was a much larger variety of veggies than expected ! Chicken Pad Thai was pretty good too - always a safe choice, there was a solid amount of chicken which allowed for both of us to enjoy and not have to fight for the chicken hehe.

They still had plenty to choose from though. We all opted for the prix fix menu, soup (I opted for wonton soup) was good, and had nice flavor with plenty of wontons.  The spring rolls were fried, I thought they would be fresh, but still were pretty good.  I went for the bbq pork pad thai and it was really tasty.  I asked for it spicy but it wasn't.  Still good though.  Two of us had to leave early and asked for boxes, it took them a bit of time to box things up, but they did a great job packaging things for us in boxes, with utensils, sauce, and chili sauce.  The service was pretty good despite being busy and the drinks were always full.  The noise level was good too despite the place being on the smaller side.  We had a good time and I would recommend going here with friends in the future!",

Not cheap but not over the too. 4 star. * Ambiance: casual, no dress code. Very clean and minmalist decor. 4 star. * Location: by the botanical garden and outer edge of the casino. 4 star. * Meals: food coming out very fast. Noodles are tasty and authentic. Desert options are pretty good. 4 star. * Service: friendly but not exception. 4 star.  Averaged to a solid 4 star.  We were hesitated at first after reading some reviews on yelp but one of Taiwanese friend recoomended this place... Also we were looking for some low key and casual place to grab a dinner. It is actually not bad!  There was no wait. The service is OK. The food comes out is super fast. My friend went to bathroom to wash hand before dinner and his food got to the table before he came back! We had sweet and spicy cucumbers, seafood udon, thai seafood noodles, chilled coconut and mango pudding for desert, and thai ice tea. The meal cost about $85 minus tip! It is not bad for the location!  - Sweet and spicy cucumber $7: not pretty to the eyes but really tasty and fresh. - seafood udon $18: good portion, very light broth with plenty and quality sea food. - Thai seafood noodle $18: spicy and tasty tom yum broth, perfectly cooked vermicelli, shitake mushrooms and half a dozen large prawns! Very yummy! - chilled coconut $10: very fresh young coconut with shred jelly. It was very fun idea and light desert without worry about calories. - mango pudding $10: served with fresh milk, very creamy, light but strong mango taste.   Overall, we were stuff and happy! They also open until 2 pm. Definitely, come back!",

I might have given this place 4 stars if the wonton noodle soup I had was not $14, and not $3.99 like I would pay for in any given Chinese restaurant anywhere else in this world.  If you are Chinese and gambling and you dont like white or fusion food, you're probably the target audience for Noodles. The only fusion thing about this place is the decor.   We tried to avoid Noodles because, well, it's in the Bellagio; but I was craving for some warm broth at 11:30pm and the PF Chang was conveniently just closed when we walked in at 11ish.   My boyfriend got the $16 BBQ pork on rice (cha siu) and I got the $14 wonton noodle soup. It's authentic, no doubt and the bbq pork on rice was REALLY good. The wonton was a little dry, and the whole thing was good (not really really good). True Chinese comfort food.  The decor is elegant, because, you know, it's the Bellagio.   I guess the main thing is that it opens really late (even after O finishes at 11:30 you can still eat there) so that's where they get you (well, if you're not interested in eating a FAT burger down the road). I was satisfied, but there's a hole in our pocket where all the money fell out.",

    "text": "Despite the mediocre reviews, I still decided to try Noodles. Staying at the Bellagio for a conference, didn't rent a car, it was already 3:30pm and I hadn't had lunch yet. So my options were pretty limited. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this adorable restaurant. All of the waiters and waitresses are Asian. I don't know why I was so surprised. Being that it is in the Bellagio I think I expected this place to be not very authentic.   The menu has food from every Asian country I could think of! Is this place Chinese food? Vietnamese food? Thai food? All of the above???  Lulu, my waitress was lovely and very attentive. Since they keep these casinos below freezing in the summer I opted for a hot tea, egg noodle soup with BBQ pork and a side of siu mai. The food came out fast, lucky me bc I was starving by then! The noodles had great texture and the broth was very tasty. The BBQ pork also had great flavor, although it was cut a bit thicker than I'm used to with my regular OC restaurants. I had a little difficulty biting it into smaller pieces. No biggie. The siu mai was very yummy as well (pretty standard). The check came out to $32. This is actually a very nice looking restaurant inside the Bellagio, so the price is to be expected.   Maybe bc I was starving. Maybe bc I already had low expectations due to previous reviews. Maybe bc my palate isn't very sophisticated when it comes to Asian dishes. But in my humble opinion I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Noodles. Lulu was so sweet it just made my experience that much better.   Unrelated side note, the couple next to me (I will not disclose their ethnicity, but you can figure it out) order fried calamari and asked for cocktail sauce. The waitress seemed very confused by their request. I think she actually handed them the drinks menu! Hilarious.",

Impressive.  However, the rest of the meal was only average, but the prices are for above average cuisine.  The pork was similar to what we get from our local Chinese delivery, and for a lot more money.  The black bean shrimp was solid, but the other dishes left something to be desired.  If the prices were about 30% less, it would get 3 stars.  But, even with the location at Bellagio, I expected more.  Service was fantastic, water glasses never empty.  Very polite.",

    "text": "Admittedly, I came in with distended expectations. Unfortunately, Noodles left my hopes rather flaccid.   I was expecting to pay considerably more than usual for Noodles and dim sum. Noodles is located on the Strip and in the Bellagio so that is a given. The return would be that these noodles and dim sum would be some of the best in town. I would have been quite happy with this trade off...but it didn't happen that way. For dim sum we had the shrimp & pork Shui Mai steamed pork dumplings, shrimp Har Gau dumplings, and the Spareribs with Yam Cube. The dim sum was all good, but not significantly better than what you can find in town at a fraction of the price. For noodles we went with XO Crabmeat Vermicelli...a dish that sounded amazing: lump crab, egg, bean sprouts, cabbage, XO sauce with an option for mild or spicy. The crab was ample and tasted fine, but the dish completely lacked flavor. It was one of the most bland noodle dishes I remember eating. The XO sauce was virtually non-existent and literally consisted of minimal bits of caramelized sauce...so disappointing. The dish we ordered spicy, yet was not even mild. This was the most expensive of the wok-fried noodles and as I walked out I was looking at other tables wondering if any of their dishes had any real essence of flavor ...and wishing I had ordered something other than this \"Signature\" dish. I started eating the noodles the way they were served.  1/3 of the way through I added some of their spicy chili paste that brought the dish up to a mild level, but the essence of the dish still lacked flavor. On the side of our noodles we also ordered the roast duck. The duck was fine. It had a good flavor, but was not as good as other considerably cheaper options in town. We finished the duck, now 2/3 of the way done with our lackluster noodles, when we minimally redeemed the otherwise uninspiring noodles by adding the duck sauce/drippings to the remaining portion of the noodles. It wasn't as good as a True XO sauce would have been, but it was certainly better than the dreary noodles.  In theory I'm the perfect local resident for a place like noodles. I want to pay more to get a better product. Too bad there wasn't anything to set them apart.  A tourist would do just fine to come in for over-priced dim sum since any other immediate options are equally inflated in price. I would only come back with someone that personally could recommend a specific dish they thought was incredible. Regina C. has good things to say about their Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle.  Overall I was certainly disappointed...so much so that I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for Noodles. Some of the food was A-Ok, but in general I have experienced better at other Strip properties and even a mile away on Spring Mountain for a significantly smaller portion of the cost. Trying to take my expectations of a wonderful taste bud experience out of the equation I decided to go with 3 a generous 3 stars in the end.",

We had, Shumai Chicken Pad Thai, Char siu bao, the 3 types of meat, the bbq pork, duck and a delecious chicken that I can't remember the name of.   The dumplings came out right away and were really good, better than general dim sum I feel like, especially the shumai.  Pad Thai was the more authentic type, more on the spicy side than sweet, with flat noodles.  Now I don't really like egg in most things, but the egg in this pad thai was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The pork, duck and chicken were also really good, portions were great and we were both really full afterwards.   I'm taking a star off mostly for the very small wine list. I would have loved more than two options for chardonnay, and its True, the service could have been faster, but we enjoyed the food so much I wasn't too worried. They also do not take reservations.",

The appetizer was decent (shrimp shumai), but the dessert was slightly lacking - mango sticky rice. When I order this, I expect my mango to be ready to eat!

The rice was either stale or undercooked. The ginger oil didn't taste that great either.   WTF happened guys?!? Get your butts together!!

    "text": "tl;dr You'd be better off going off strip down Spring Mountain road for better dim sum. It is overpriced for sub par food. Service was too slow   We came to Noodles because my husband and I had too much fun the previous night and wanted soup. We were staying at Vdara and Noodle was a short walk over. We were aware the lines may be long but we arrived at 1 pm on a Sunday and there were 4 parties in front of us. We were shown a table in 20 minutes.  They have an extensive menu with all the favorite dishes (like egg noodle and wontons, fried rice, Chinese broccoli, etc). It was confusing because they had a dim sum menu inside their menu and a dim sum menu on a piece of paper (like how you would normally order dim sum) and the prices were different. It took us a while to figure out that dim sum was still available via the cart and is cheaper to order from there than on the menu.  My husband and I ordered the shu Mai (2 ordered cause it ended up being so good, but only comes with 3 pieces instead of 4), har gow, egg noodle soup with wonton, cucumber salad, and Shanghai noodle.  The shu Mai was the best, but everything else was mediocre and over priced. The cucumber salad was too sweet and the Shanghai dumpling was dry. I compare these two items to Din Tai Fung and it's better there than it is here! It was an experience that I don't want to have again.",

    "text": "So I trusted my fellow Yelpers' reviews and thought this place would be good... especially since they had \"Korean\" dishes here (only Kimchee... wtf?!). So my friends and I decided to eat here, because what's better than pho or hot noodles after a weekend of anti-soberness?   We got their (only) seafood pho and pork chow mein.  Seafood Pho: $18.50 for a tiny (small) bowl of noodles. I actually really liked the broth BECAUSE it wasn't salty... you can tell they don't really put MSG or salt in it cuz it was bland. Therefore, probably healthier. however, it's practically $20! you can't give me another cup of noodles?! I got three decent sized shrimps and lots of fishcakes (in Korean- o-dang). They charge extra for lime and bean sprouts... wtf?! Save your money and get pho from anywhere OTHER than here.  Chow Mein: the noodles were REALLY good... tender and the pork, just right. i highly recommend it, though it was also almost $20.   Overall, the food wasn't all that bad, just overpriced by 200%.  My REAL review is for their service. Why are there 10 people working, but no one to check up on us? What is WRONG with your service? The people here clearly don't want to work because when we ask for something, they either smirk and roll their eyes, or they say yes and 20 mins. later and asking ANOTHER person, will you receive your items.   My friends and I wanted to spend at most 30-45 mins ordering, eating, and all that. Nope... spent almost 2 hours! luckily, us girls can keep ourselves entertained.  I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this place. Save your money and just go to Panda Express.",

    "text": "Wish I'd read some Yelp reviews before stepping in to Noodles - a friend had a decent experience and it was convenient so we went. Upon being seated we were greeted by a female server that seemed very annoyed we were taking up her space. I asked a question about the menu and she acted like I had two heads and simply pointed at the menu (no, it wasn't a language barrier). Then the noise began. The tables were so close together the lady to my right's phone conversation made it difficult to hear my fiance ... and the call lasted the entire length of our meal. About the time the entree arrived (food: average at best) the servers decided to reposition every chair in the restaurant by sliding them over the tile floor instead of picking them up, creating an unbelievably loud screeching sound from every direction. This was also the time  the kitchen staff found it necessary to begin pounding on something that apparently needed a LOT of pounding ... Really loud pounding! The couple to our left finally had enough and called over the server to complain. The server listened then  disappeared to the kitchen ... and the noise continued until we'd almost finished. I was so annoyed and uptight all I could think of was getting out of there ... So we did ... But they weren't done with us ... My fiance and I had stomach trouble for the next 24 hours.   Bottom line: Noodles is a great location ... for some other restaurant.  Update: Let me be clear: The service culture and facility that is Bellagio (other than Noodles) was FLAWLESS during our stay. We ate at several restaurants that were excellent; visited bars, tables, etc. Noodles may be part of Bellagio but it was on another planet from the rest of our Bellagio experience. Changes in that part of the resort need to be made. I would like to thank Bellagio for an overall awesome experience!",

I recently stayed at the Bellagio and came here everyday. The first two nights, I ordered the Mandarin beef noodle soup. This is a beef stew noodle soup and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's also good hangover food. They give plenty of beef (they better for the price) and the broth (stew) was refreshing.   Before leaving I had the dim sum and was not impressed. They didn't have my favorite dim sum dish and the items were limited. I would not come here to get the dim sum. We left with a large bill and feeling hungry.   If I just went for the beef stew noodle soup, I would give Noodles four stars. Try the soup, if you're at the Bellagio. It's $20, but worth a try if you want Asian food.",

Was going to have dinner at Lago , but will have to wait 2 hours to get a table at the patio to watch the water fountain show.   Walked around and saw Noodles and decided to try it. We were seated in about 10 mins by a friendly hostess.   We enjoyed the quality and taste of our food.  we had the braised beef brisket w/ tendon ,  bok choy , and steamed rice, and the barbecue pork with bok choy and steamed rice.  We were served promptly by the wait staff and are satisfied with the service and the quality of our meal.   They could probably do a little better by giving more portions of meat.    Not a bad place to eat if you want to have Chinese food on the strip vs driving to Chinatown.",

We shared 4 dishes.  Soup, fried rice, veggies and duck.  My favorite was the vegetable stir fry.  I ate all of it.  The fried rice was ok.  But one thing that caught me off guard was the roast duck.  I have had Chinese roast duck for many years.  It was my grandfather favorite.  The duck was so gamey.  I didn't know what to do. To follow it with rice or drink water.   It was an ok experience.  It's is beautiful inside the restaurant but if I was there for food.  I would pass there are other places to try.     Stars  .5 star for food .5 for service.   1 for facilities  1 star for over all experience.",

    "text": "Tucked away in the corner of the Bellagio casino floor is Noodles, one of the few casual dining places within the hotel.  Noodles serves food from all different Asian cuisines, but the majority of the menu is Chinese.   Don't let the name fool you, they also have rice dishes, meats and seafood, vegetables and dim sum.      A group of us shared some dishes family-style.  We started with Shu Mai (5 pcs/$10), Crispy Shrimp Balls (4 pcs/$10) and Vegetable Spring Rolls (3pcs/$10).  All three came out piping hot and were enjoyable, but the shrimp balls stood out with their perfectly fried crunchy exterior.  For the main dishes we shared Fried Rice with BBQ pork ($18.25), Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle Soup ($19.50), Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles ($19.88) and Sauteed Bok Choy ($13).  Surprisingly, the chow mein was just okay.  It had too much vegetable and not enough noodles, and I'm used to chow mein noodles being thinner and longer.  The fried rice was a better dish to me.  The bok choy was nothing special, we just wanted veggies.  The Thai soup had a very flavorful tangy/spicy broth and came with good sized shrimp.  Although we shared everything, the soups are really individual size servings.  The food here is good but I would've liked it even more if they served fresh, house made noodles given the name of the restaurant.  If you don't mind paying the price of convenience on The Strip, give this place a try.",

In the same time that they ate, paid and left, we did not get our food.  No, we didn't order anything crazy.  We ordered pork steam buns as an app (pre-made) and rice with duck and roast pork (items that are pre-cooked) and dan dan noodle soup as our main dishes.  We didn't get the app until the couple next to us was leaving.  And I'm sure of this because the lady was getting up and asked what we were eating because she had never seen steamed buns before.  The couple 3 seats away got there after us and they were eating before us.  Over 30 minutes to get an app isn't acceptable in any circumstance.  What's worse is we got no information from the server.  Yes, this is supposed to be in the style of a dim sum house, but we are still in Vegas, spending an exorbitant amount on pre-made dim sum so I expect proper service.  The food was ok.  Not the best, not the worst.  The flavor of the duck was great but the pork was dry and seemed a little old.  The dan dan noodle soup didn't taste like a dan dan noodle inspired dish but once I added chili paste, it was good.  Not really worth coming back, except if you're hungry and you have comps to spend.",

Potstickers were so tasty we ordered two plates- and saved the dipping sauce because it could go on anything. The rolls were cut in bite-sized pieces which made them easily shareable.

The remade version was spicy when we didn't ask for any spice level. When we received the bill we asked for that entree to not be included since we didn't take more than two bites. Manager stated that it was our fault because our taste buds are too sensitive! I'm surprised Bellagio allows this type of service! Bellagio manager/owner should look into this restaurant business and practice. Consider that Bellagio is rated the top 100 hotels in U.S. and rated 5 Star. This restaurant doesn't deserve to be in Bellagio, hence their average rating on yelp validate any negative claims. Nothing should be average in Bellagio.",

There was plenty of variety for different soup flavors, fit for everyone. For me, I ordered the mandarin beef stew. My experience with beef stew is that it's either too starchy from the noodles, or too salty. But this one was absolutely perfect. And they didn't skimp on the beef!   My boyfriend got the sweet and spicy noodles with bbq pork. It was very unique and delicious, I definitely helped him finish it all hehe. I also got a taste of everyone's soup (because I like to help myself to everyone's food lol) and I was impressed by the quality and variety of flavors as well.

I understand you don't want to take advance reservations but why not have a waitlist as people show up and call /text them (old fashioned),  why create un-necessary long  lines unless it gives some pleasure for chef(s) that people line up for our food. Dealing with arguments around managing  logistics issues like party of 12 who are later in the line to be placed before party of 3 who arrived earlier. Even saw people who were already dining to move for similar adjustments :( Found it weird.. I simply feel theres no reason to make people wait if can be avoided.

This dish was very tasty and the pieces of crab meat were plentiful and rather large sized. It was a good sized portion, probably enough for two people family style.   For dessert I had the mango sticky rice. I would not recommend this dessert. The mango was tart. Not sweet at all!  Perhaps it was off season for delicious fresh mango?  The rice was a little on the hard/firm side and it was smothered with coconut sauce. The textures and flavors just didn't do it for me. I'd probably try something else for dessert next time.  Overall, I would come here again next time I stay at the Bellagio, however I might try other restaurants first and if no seats are available then I'd give this place another try.",

The size is definitely comparable to an extra small from where I am from. It was disappointing that they didn't even use wonton egg noodles for this entree. Fine rice noodles was cooked in lieu of egg noodles. The broth is nothing but MSG (Mmm, So Good!) that left me feeling parched!   Service here is poor. Waitress was not very attentive to our table.

Without someone showing it to you, you might have walked past it without knowing. We dined here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait at all. The restaurant decorations were on par with the rest of Vegas. Interesting and unique.  We ordered pan fried potstickers, pad thai, kung pao shrimp, seafood noodles and the hainanese chicken rice. When I bit into the potstickers, the meat and texture didn't taste quite right. I felt like something was missing. I think the meat wasn't as juicy as I would have hoped for. The dipping sauce that came with them was pretty bland too. I personally ordered the hainanese chicken rice and it came with a side of house rice, chicken (you had the option of bone in or out, which is nice), soup, and dipping sauces (ginger, soy sauce and chili). I was really hoping for some unique flavors for the dipping sauces. The only side that I actually liked was the soup! Pretty flavorful, but not enough to make me order it again. When I looked at the kung pao shrimp, there was at most eight shrimps for the entire dish! Not to mention that it costed $22. For that amount of money, you'd think that they would at least give you more or decent sized ones.   Service was good though. One of the servers noticed that our food was taking awhile to deliver (even though I didn't think so) so she personally checked on it without us having to talk to her. I noticed it out of the corner of my eye.   Overall verdict: For the price that we paid, I don't think I'll come back unless they up their game!",

    "text": "I was sorely disappointed at the lack of flavor and service at this restaurant, being that it is in the Bellagio.  Despite being a casual dining place, the prices were fairly high, but typical for something in this hotel.  To be honest, I get much better Chinese food off the strip and felt robbed of my money when paying the check, but I'll explain that in a bit.  First, we were in the Bellagio for something to eat, since I wanted Jean Philippe's afterward.  We walked toward the buffet and I was adamant on trying this restaurant because of the lovely decor and simple menu.  We were seated immediately at the back corner of the restaurant against the wall.  The part that irritated me was this grass skirt hanging decor that hung over our soy sauce and touched the table and I.  To top it off, it was extremely dusty and dust particles were falling slowly, like snow, onto the table.  I was shocked to see filthy decor on the wall.  Still, we ordered our food and we had to stick it out.  The shumai and chicken satay appetizers came out first.  Both were okay but nothing to rave about.  Although it was packed with flavor, the shumai reminded me of mushy microwavable shumai from the grocery store.  I wasn't impressed at all.  As for the chicken satay, it was dry and the sauce wasn't flavorful for my taste.  It simply fell short.  My husband wanted the main courses to be outstanding, as did I, but alas--they were sad plates of Chinese food.  We ordered a chicken chow mein, soya chicken (skin on) and bbq pork fried rice.  All of it was blase.  I wasn't impressed with the flavors, textures, or presentation.  The fried rice was extremely dry and was fluffy, almost as if they used Uncle Ben's rice instead of regular rice to make the dish.  The chow mein was okay, but it was overpowered by salt for some reason.  As for the soya chicken, it was moist and tasted good enough to chew and swallow.  After an 83 dollar check for what we ordered, I was upset at this place for charging those prices for meager Chinese food.  The service was prompt on drinks, but that was it.  Our server was also very pushy.  After ordering our first entree he was ready to leave.    After all that I wanted to stop at Beijing Noodle at Caesar's to get shumai and noodles, and then HK and Food Express for other chinese dishes to make me feel better about Chinese food.  It was sad, sad eats at this restaurant.  I hate being depressed over food so expensive.  I will never eat at this place again, although the food was edible.  It lacks luster and authenticity despite the 100's of asians working the kitchen and the floor.  Either someone dumbed down their taste or they believe dumbing down Chinese food appeals to the masses.  Either way, someone did something very wrong at this place, and it will kill them in the long run.  Steer clear of Noodles.  I'm thankful it's in a corner that most people don't walk by because it doesn't deserve an audience.",

If you want to pay $7 for a meal go to panda.  For two your probably in for about $75.  Noodles are solid, and I usually get some pork.  Service is attentive.  I would say on the same level as Beijing Noodle #9 at Caesars.",

This place has something that I grew up with in Congee with pickled vegetables.  The pickles vegetables normally consist of pickled radishes along with some peanuts and some dried shredded pork.  I have tried the won ton noodle soup as it is a staple for any noodle shop.

The menu is large and most everything is good.   The wonton noodle soup (I get mine with rice noodles instead of egg) is a meal and a bargain at only $14. The shrimp filled wontons are very good. I also like the Thai spicy noodle soup, it comes with several large shrimp. My favorite appetizer is the char si piu, bits of pork in a doughy steamed sweet bun. I used to like the pad thai but lately it has been sticky and thick, not good at all. My dad joined me recently and raved about the duck, though I didn't try it, since I am not a fan. Ask for extra hot XO sauce, it's the best.   They do dim sum Fri-Sun from 11-3 so get in then for their best options :)",

The manager walked around talking to all the tables that were non-asian and ignored the asian tables. What is up with that???  The food was good, but I could probably find the same quality of food at chinatown for cheaper prices.  It's an okay place to eat if you want to grab a quick bite with no regards to service.  The dim sum is pretty good, and they still push around the little carts.    Note:  Some of the servers do not speak English.",

    "text": "We went here for dim sum on our way out of Vegas, thanks to the suggestion of lovely Yelper Jacquie C. There was quite a long wait on a Sunday afternoon, unless you were willing to sit in the smoking section (we weren't). When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person. Overall, great food, though the experience was lacking since we were so tired and hungry.",

    "text": "After seeing endless commercials for this \"Asian Fare\" restaurant on the TV in our Bellagio suite, my husband and I treated ourselves to an early dinner at Noodles, located on the Casino floor of the prestigious Vegas hotel. Having lived in China and traveled around Asia myself, I am always up for some \"authentic\" Asian cuisine, and as Noodles boasted renowned chefs and dishes, I figured this was our best bet.  The only thing authentic about Noodles was its customers and staff, most of whom were Asian. My husband ordered the BBQ steamed bun appetizer, which was decent though nothing to write to Asia about. He also though ahead and ordered a $2.50 cup of white rice (no brown rice on the menu), while I ordered the Chinese broccoli \"entree.\" The dish was nothing more than a few large pieces of Chinese broccoli doused in a garlic sauce. Since of course there were no knives available, I had to gnaw at the broccoli bite by bite in order to finish the plate. The broccoli had been Americanized with its heavy, sugary sauce and was so fiber-esk that it was nearly inedible. By the end of the meal I had eaten more rice with soy sauce (the latter being the most delicious part of our \"meals\") and went back to my suite $30 bucks poorer.  Go to Noodles if: You are with a family or group and intend to eat entrees in the authentically Asian \"family style\" (as they were most likely meant to be eaten); are willing to put out a good $20 per person minimum; if you want some Japanese sake or Tsing Tao beer for $7 a bottle (it's a quarter in China!); if you are an interior design buff who gets off on elaborate and somewhat exaggerated Chinese decor (which gets a bit overwhelming fast). Don't go to Noodles if: You want a quality meal for two under $50, you prefer to cut your food before stuffing it in your mouth and gnawing off the leftovers.",

A couple of negatives-First, the restroom is outside of the restaurant alllll the way across the casino floor.  Not ideal at all.  Second,  though staff that greet guests at the front were nice, the waiter was completely aloof. Didn't give an intro on what the restaurant was about, and never asked me how my food was. I intentionally did not ask for a refill on my soda to see how long it would take him to offer one ( came at the very end of my meal, but he did bring a new soda)-I observed a waitress also not introducing the restaurant, not mentioning any recommendations, specials, etc.  seems to be a culture there (lack of customer service)-That said,  the meal was fantastic!  Very delicious- but even the greatest of dishes can't out win superb customer service, which this placed lacked.  Would recommend if you don't have high (or even standard) expectations from staff.

I guess this is expected since I always lose money at Bellagio and eating here is just another way for them to win my money. I never thought I would be paying $15 for a bowl of beef stew noodles. For that price, I could buy 3 bowls of noodles around my neighborhood or 7-10 bowls of noodles in Taiwan. My girlfriend ordered the beef stew noodles which actually was decent and I ordered the tom yum noodles with shrimp which was about $17. Overall this place is expensive for the food you're actually getting but the taste is alright. I would recommend skipping this place and either pay extra money and eat something a lot better or pay a lot less and just go to a cafe or eat fast food.",

First, the hostesses took a while to seat us despite the fact that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. Once we were seated, and we ordered our food, it took a really long time for it to come out. I'm a pretty patient person, and I would not say gluttony is a deadly sin of mine, but wow the food took SO LONG to come out. If the restaurant was busier I would understand, but wow it took literally more than half an hour after we ordered, and we only had five people in our party. Food was alright...kind of mediocre, I wouldn't come here again (& for more reasons below!). The five of us each got different dishes and they were okay...pretty subpar. I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.  The worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might've had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with \"Sorry about that, hope you feel better.\" ...thanks, NOODLES.  Overall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-  Get it together, NOODLES!",

    "text": "Overpriced food! About $75 (after tip) for three entrees and an iced tea: beef noodle soup, chicken curry, and pork chow mein. The three stars reflects quality of food and value. The beef noodle soup is very tasty with good portions of tender beef as well as (what I think) is ox tail tendon--very good flavor. The chicken curry was oily--this is not like Indian curry which has a coconut base, nor is it like Japanese curry which has a thicker sauce. This curry has a hot chili oil and a soup base. The pork chow mein was fine. Everything tasted fine--a SoCal point of reference: on par with a meal from Sam Woo's. But it was definitely not worth $75. This was good Chinese food you could get in Vancouver or the San Gabriel valley in SoCal for about half the price. For paying top dollar, i would expect more \"wow\" but did not taste it. Service was fine and food came out in a timely fashion.",

Although it was a generous serving, thought it tasted fishy! Spring rolls were good but it's hard to mess up a fried spring roll, right? The spicy cucumbers had good flavor but not chilled as advertised, and accustomed to at other restaurants. Because the soup was off, I basically ate a spring roll and cucumbers for dinner.  If looking for a restaurant in a premiere hotel on the strip, I would would say, try somewhere else.",

Thankfully my friend didn't like her food at all so I could eat her rice. We had to eat 2 hours later again.",

    "text": "I feel like this place is probably the most authentic Chinese restaurant I have been to on the Strip. The chefs are actually Asian and servers also (I saw with my very own eyes)!  We ordered the traditional Chinese beef noodle soup and jook with century egg and pork.  They were extremely generous with the meat in both dishes. The beef noodle soup had a gigantic piece of tendon/cartilage (AWESOME!!) along with other pieces of beef. It was obvious that they had been stewing for a long time since the meat was very tender and soft, and fell apart each bite. The soup was what I considered to be quite precise with traditional taste, but definitely milder in spiciness, which makes sense since they also need to appeal to non-Asian customers. The jook was good and tasted close to what I am accustomed to. They were super generous with the century egg (!), though slightly less so with the pork.  Prices were a bit high, but that is expected. The service was top-notch and super friendly! The food we had was most definitely better in taste and texture than Noodle Asia in the Venetian. We were very happy to have discovered this place!",

Where I'm from it's like $5-$10 max wherever I've been.  Pretty ridiculous pricing here if you ask me.  And the pho wasn't even great; it tasted plain.  My friend got the cucumber salad.  When the waitress brought it out it looked like a side order or extra stuff like cilantro that you'd put on your food.  Plate was hella small in portion.  And it cost $8.  So glad I didn't opt for salad this time.  I would've been super disappointed and pissed.  I ordered the fried rice which cost $15-16 bucks.  I was so happy with this order compared to the rest.  It tasted decent and It was bigger in portion LOL  I did have to add a lot of hot sauce to it and peppers.  When my one friend wanted a beer, she asked the waitress.  The waitress told her she had to order that at the bar!  Lolololol of course I should've expected this.  Asian customer service has mostly always been terrible.  Luckily, the waitress changed her mind and got it for her.  Overall, the restaurant is nice-looking, the customer service is a little less than decent but not terrible, the food was mostly plain and expensive, and if I were to ever eat here again (if my friends drag me here) I would opt for the fried rice again.",

Since we arrived in Vegas late, not much in our hotel was open, but we noticed Noodles had a line, so we decided to suck it up and wait.   We were seated pretty quick,but were stuck in the back, by the kitchen door. The staff weren't friendly, but they weren't rude... Just didn't seem to care if you were there or not. My husband and I eat Thai food regularly, so we had some experience beneath us before deciding what to eat. I didn't want anything too heavy, since it was so late, so I opted for the fried rice and my husband had duck with a side of steamed rice. My fried rice was tasteless and dry. My husband's duck didn't have much flavor and full of fat.   We had to wait quite a while for our check.....so I guess to sum this up is don't go, unless you just have to. The service isn't good and the food is simply overpriced and tasteless.",

The restaurant has very weak reviews so I should have known better than to go here, just didn't want to leave the casino.  Not too many people even knew about this place and it was a little tricky to find.   We had the Sweet and Spicy Noodles that were not really good. The noodles had chicken pieces in it but they tasted a little off. We had an order of the Spicy Cucumber which was the best dish of all. We also had the Sesame Chicken, it was almost inedible. It was dry and the sauce tasted like it had ketchup in it.   This was thee worst Chinese food that I've ever had., honestly. I can't believe that the Bellagio hotel has this restaurant in its lineup. It has great decor and the service was excellent, that's why I actually have this review 2 stars. Will never even consider this place again. It probably won't last at a hotel this great.",

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent.   On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.  I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of \"what do you want to eat,\" not \"can I answer any questions you might have?\"   Overpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no. If you find yourself in a pinch like I did, needing to grab a bite to eat while on a break, Noodles is a good choice. Otherwise, I'd stick to finding other real-deal restaurants in Vegas and steer clear.",

To be clear, this place is a bit of a rip-off and I'm fairly certain there are far better pan-Asian restaurants a short drive away, but c'mon people - when you're in Vegas you generally want to stay within the confines of the Strip so you can continue to gamble and be dazzled by all of the glittery-pretty stuff in the big casinos.  In any event, I got the Laksa Curry Noodle and was not at all disappointed.  It was rich, hearty, and flavorful with just the right amount of spice - like a nice warm hug of a soupy-noodle dish.  My friend got the Spicy Thai Shrimp Noodle - and while it wasn't totally authentic, thought it fragrant and delicious.  Given all of the decadently-amazing restaurants in Vegas, it was kind of nice enjoying a simple, quick meal - and if I had to do it again, I would.",

We went in expecting the food to taste Westernized, but it was actually pretty good.  The restaurant was pretty full, but we were seated within 15 mins.    I saw \"Laksa Curry Noodle\" on the menu and my eyes lit up.  I still reminisce about the authentic and oh-so-good food I had while in Malaysia, so I was looking forward to trying the version here.    The bowl was full of chunks of chicken breast, fish \"cake\" slices, an egg, a load of noodles, and creamy curry sauce.  Although it wasn't as authentic as the laksa noodle dishes I had in Malaysia, Noodles' version is pretty good.  Of course the price ($18) is a bit steep for a bowl of noodles, but it's to be expected since it's located inside the lovely Bellagio (see pic).  My friends ordered the Vietnamese Seafood Pho (just ok, not authentic enough) and the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (nice hearty flavor).    I would eat here again if I was too lazy to catch a cab to the plethora of Asian restaurants located on Spring Mountain Road (off the strip).",

The chicken noodle garlic soup was probably the best soup I have ever tasted. Easy five star reco!!!",

Yes, it's more than the Bay Area, but it's in the Bellagio in Vegas.   At least I didn't feel I over paid for crappy food.  The Won Ton wasn't mystery meat.  It was shrimp.  I was pleasantly surprised how thin the skin on the Har Gow was.  Actually it was thinner than some places in the Bay Area.",

I got a noodle plate and while it was pretty huge, the noodles were overcooked and the entire plate was just slimy. Not appetizing at all.

It's very good and not as greasy and heavy as some of the dim sum places I've been to.

Their soup base tasted more like Chinese broth and the rice noodles were chewy. Their fried rice was horrible...$15 for fried rice with barely any vegetables or char siu...what a ripoff.

Plus the dim sum was room temperature or barely warm.  At best, I would say this wasn't worth more than $30.   Just my opinion.  Looking for decent food at a good price-rent a car & leave the strip.  Don't make yourself a captive there.",

The plates were smaller than other dim sum places not located in vacation areas, the ambiance wasn't super vegasy, and the wait was about 25 minutes (they don't allow reservations).

The waitress just left all of our food infront of 1 person, maybe she forgot who ordered what? She was super rude and didn't speak much English only reason they are getting even 3 stars was because their pork and duck was good. Worst restaurant at belliago for sure.

The chicken rice was presented well but the taste was disappointing. The chicken was salty, and tasted more like Hong Kong style steamed chicken. The chili sauce was out of a jar, garlic chili. The Ginger sauce was super salty. The curry laksa dish was not authentic either.   Too light, creamy, and the noodles were too soft. For close to $20 per dish, I expected a near perfect rendition. Unfortunately, neither came close.",

It reminded me of food that I can get back home, except for the price. But of course, it's at the Bellagio so that's normal.  We had potstickers and egg rolls for appetizers. The potstickers were tasty and egg rolls crunchy.  For entrees, we had the seafood congee and stir fry noodles with XO lobster sauce. The XO noodles were a little too peppery but still were very yummie!!  This is a good place for breakfast/ lunch/ brunch. It is a small restaurant and it does get crowded, so plan ahead.  The decor was also cute I thought, the wall on one side of the restaurant was covered by glass jars of different types of dry noodles. See pictures.  What a nice touch!",

Good portions too and the service is friendly and attentive.  The decor is really pretty, lots of soft ambient lighting and extensive use of wood and plant material everywhere. Our group sat at one of their bench-seat tables and the seat was really bizarre. It had a very low-rise back rest which felt weird to have only my lower back supported while dining.  This is more of a stop-by-on-a-whim place than a restaurant you'd go out of your way to eat at. It's very laid back and casual so they don't expect diners to show up in expensive suits or dressy outfits.",

My shrimp dumpling noodle soup dish was $13.50, only a slight markup to the same dish at comparable places (example:  Zao in Palo Alto, and Long Life at Stanford Shopping Center).    When you level five acres of the most expensive real estate in the world for a LAKE, for crying outloud (Bellagio's lake on the strip), you can justify a few more bucks for Pho in your restaurants.",

The prices definitely reflect that you're paying for the location and not necessarily the quality of the food.   My boyfriend had the seafood Udon which he liked.  I had the braised beef soup, which was bland.  The portion size was decent enough.  We ate most of our meal and were full.   All in all, I'm disappointed.  I won't be coming back here again.

I prefer to visit for Dim Sum, which is like a Chinese-brunch, and is served on the weekends from 11-2. We usually order a botte of wine or sake, a noodle or rice dish, and then just pick and choose whatever looks yummy on the carts that travel by every few minutes. The pork dumplings, shrimp balls, and BBQ pork buns are all amazing!!! There always seems to be a line when I come here, but it is always worth the wait!",

The food was okay. We ordered veggie spring rolls which were good but i've had better. We also got the mongolian beef and some chicken friend rice. All yummy but by no means the best.

The veggies, a mix of eggplant, zucchini, broccoli and sweet potato, had a nice bite and the tempura batter was light and crisp; whoever was working the deep-fat fryer knew what she was doing. The dipping sauce was not too sweet and with a bit of chili paste was the perfect compliment to the deep fried veggies.   For our entree we split two dishes: chicken Penang fried kway teow which is comprised of flat rice noodles, sprouts and chili - this was the star of the show, although in retrospect we should have gotten it with pork instead - and the Xo crab meat vermicelli which was tasty but a little flat (chili paste and soy rescued it but if it takes that much seasoning what's the point?).",

First time we went we was the night we landed and we had all been awake for around 24 hours. I got an earlier flight so I was especially tired.  The 2nd time we visited here, we had a lobster (the normal Chinese style with garlic and spring onions). Very tasty - although Manchester (UK) is just as good!  When I did my result for Chinese restaurants in Vegas, there were several but I think a lot of them are either modern/contemporary so all sorts of fancy stuff and/or very expensive.

The ratio of soup to noodle is out of balanced.  Only 1/3 of the bowl was filled with soup and the rest noodles.

I ordered the pad thai...and what do I receive? Something that resembles chinese chow fun, but tastes like plaster. It didn't even remotely taste like pad thai...or chow fun for that matter. My fiancee ordered the char shiu noodle soup. ALSO inedible. The noodles weren't even close to being fully cooked and were still HARD. The broth was sooooo salty...Morton's called them and is asking for their salt back. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice wasn't even fully steamed before frying so it tasted like pieces of gravel. I can't believe the Bellagio would allow a product like this to be sold on their property. I will never go back again. That place was complete ASS. (and expensive!)  Oh, and no refills on soda? What the hell is that???",

I was in love with this place so I've been wanting to go back.  Today after so many years my dream came True.  Except it was not a pleasant dream.   We were in town for the day on business and we had very limited time to eat and catch our flight back.  So my husband and I both ordered a bowl of noodles and agedashi tofu and a  hargow as appetizers.   The food took forever to come out even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  The agedashi tofu was basically small cubes of tofu just deep fried, completely not what it's supposed to be.  I guess one can only find an authentic agedashi tofu at a Japanese restaurant.   The shrimp dumplings were pretty average, a little bit on the drier side. The beef noodles was tasty but also not very flavorful as most other places.  The noodles was the best part, perfectly cooked and fresh but lacked quantity.  It came with a chunk of tendon and two gigantic pieces of beef.  I was a bit turned off by the looks of the huge pieces of beef... Sadly, this was a total disappointment for me.  Not worth the price they charge.",

    "text": "I frequent Vegas and usually stays at the Bellagio, needless to say I've tried all the restaurants the hotel has to offer, some multiple times! Noodles is one of my favorite eats at the Bellagio (as well as the entire strip).   The restaurant itself is very clean and nicely decorated; staff are friendly and food usually comes out pretty fast. Reasonably priced for hotel restaurant standards. Most dishes are about $18+, with decent sized portions.  Most of their appetizers are nothing to write home about with the exception of the Roti Prata (Roti bread with curry sauce), the curry has just the right amount of kick without being too sweet. The Laksa curry noodle is my favorite dish hands down (huge portion too). Perfectly cooked noodles in a rich coconut curry broth. It's a little spicy so I don't recommend this for people who like their food mild. Another recommendation is the sea bass congee. Mildly seasoned and the fish is very fresh, great choice for someone who is looking for something tasty and light. Their BBQ is surprisingly good and authentic, duck and bbq pork are the two popular choices. Though it can be a little too salty at times. Be sure to try their Mango pudding as well as fresh mango served with a side of coconut sesame rice (forgot the actual name of the dish) if you're craving for something sweet.   Nice restaurant, friendly service and great food. There's really nothing to not like about Noodles. Only downside is they tend to get pretty busy, if you go during dinner time there's usually a wait.",

Well, given that they've got Monets, high-end baccarat, and a bunch of other cool stuff, yes, I guess I do.  Take that traditional Southeastern Asian cuisine, add Americanized customer service, feng shui decor...and you've got Noodles.  I ordered Hainanese Chicken Rice there - an ancestral traditional dish and one of my favorite foods to eat in the whole world, and it was prepared wonderfully - out there in the middle of the damn Nevada desert.  If you have a Chinese food itch that a Chinese take-out place won't scratch, come here.  You'll also have the pleasure of walking through my favorite casino in Las Vegas (a town I only come to for food and shows).",

Various congee, pea-pod greens, roast pig and duck mmm....   My dad swears by their Hainan Chicken Rice which is essentially comfort food for him.  Whats odd is the food looks and taste authentic, but its served in a P.F. Chang like setting with odd shaped platters and high prices!   I am sure some of that cost goes to the tasteful decor and pricey location.   If you want more affordable authentic asian fare you could take a cab or rent a car to hit the restaurants on Spring Mountain Road.  If your are on the strip anyways, check this place out!",

Craving food so late at night/early in the morning, I passed by Noodles and seeing that the line was so short, decided to wait it out.  Let me just say that the length of the line is deceiving.  Even though there was only 3 parties in front of me, I was in line for almost two hours...  I ordered the beef noodle soup and shui mai, and my friend ordered the BBQ pork rice. Because of the high prices I was expecting my food to be beautiful , but was not impressed with the plating at all.  The part that sucks the most is that the food was just mediocre.  It tasted just like any beef noodle soup I could get for 5 bucks in chinatown.  It's actually pretty likely that it was below mediocre, because food tastes better when I'm hungry and having skipped lunch and dinner I was starving.  The beef was so tough, perhaps they should of provided me a hammer along with my chopsticks to help me break down the meat.     Another thing I'm going to add is that the water tasted so bad, it seems ridiculous that I'm complaining about the taste of water but my friend agreed that it left a strange unsettling aftertaste.   I was actually kinda pissed off because after looking at my glass I found that it was dirty.  The only good thing is that service is good, I definitely won't be coming again though.",

The shu mai is a great addition to any meal of you like dumplings. I'm a huge fan. The nigori genshu sake is my favorite, cloudy unfiltered with a sweet aftertaste. The restaurant is well lit, first come first serve, no reservations taken which can be difficult on a weekend. The wall tapestries are made of long hay grass twisted and hanging.

I was able to try a variety of small dishes.  Loved the steamed dumplings and the almond crusted shrimp.  My husband had a nice seafood stew. Great Sunday lunch.  Sitting at the bar upfront was also fine, didn't mind it at all.  Cool decor inside as well.",

It good forever to get a glass of water ad to pay our bill. We asked for our check and they gave it like 20 minutes later.   It's worth trying, especially if you're craving pho.",

    "text": "It was the third day away from NYC food in combination of eating Vegas style steak+eggs-ish meals .... Noodles really hit the spot, even at $15 a small bowl of noodle soup (which would easily cost $3.75 in NYC chinatown).  The food here isn't your typical Americanized chinese take-out.  Believe me, there is NO SUCH THING as sweet & sour pork or general tso's chicken in real chinese cuisine....  Noodles is on par in terms of taste.  If a restaurant can make money, have customers return, and write good reviews by serving food with 800% mark-up, bravo to you, seriously.  And for that, I refuse to give more than 2stars for such an establishment.   The only complaint I had was the bowls were rather small compare to what I'm use to (Universal order of #1 at any Viet pho restaurant.... Taiwanese noodle shops... or even Korean naengmyun noodle bowls), and they don't give you much broth.    Being that I was pretty sick of buffet foods and rich french (Vegas-style) cuisine easily price at $40+ per person, paying $15 a bowl of noodles was fulfilling.  PS - my Chinese parents would have died and hit themselves in the face with bokchoy and hot sauce if they knew I spent $50+ for a bowl of duck noodle soup, chicken congee, and roti canai.  Seriously, yo.",

    "text": "Review based on 20+ visits.  Although the food here isn't amazing, it's pretty good. You'll find a lot of food here that you won't anywhere else in Vegas. This place is pretty much run by Asian people, so a lot of the diners here are actually Asian people as well. Waitresses usually speak both Mandarin and Cantonese, and of course English. So even if you come with your non-English speaking parents, you won't get into a mess with ordering. Asians have a hard time adapting to fancy food, so this place is very comfortable to eat at. The price is bit high, but it's Vegas. If you're complaining about the prices, why are you in Vegas in the first place? Walk down the street to a McDonald's or something. Most of the dishes here are pretty authentic tasting, though some do have a modern or 'American' touch to them. Don't expect their iced teas to taste like the Asian cafe type! They're still the unsweetened American restaurant version. The decor is pretty cool. Just lit up walls with shelves of different types of dry noodles in glass jars. Also very clean! Waits are usually no more than 30 minutes from my experiences, though sometimes I see some pretty long lines.  Overview: Great Asian food, especially for Vegas. Modern decor. Nice utensils and plating. Well-lit restaurant. Very clean! Run by Asian people. Waitresses speak Cant + Mand + Eng. Pricey, but not fine-dining pricey. Normal by Vegas standards. Waits are usually no more than 30 minutes at most hours of the day.",

    "text": "Went to Noodles the day after my friend got married at the Bellagio.  We had a large party (10 people) and waited for an hour and a half as other groups were seated before us.  After waiting this long, the staff finally thinks to offer to split our group.  (Really?! You just sat about 5 parties in front of ours, and from what I saw of the restaurant, you probably could not have found seating for our entire group anyway---so what took so long?)  My now shrunken group of 6 finally gets seated, and the waiter takes 15-20 minutes to come over and take our orders.  (BTW, what restaurant does not offer a side of veggies?  The only veggie offered separately on the menu was edamame, for $7!)    When the food finally rolls out (slowly), the orders are completely wrong.    I ordered the Beef Brisket Stew Noodles.  What I got was oxtails with noodles and bok choy.  One of my fellow dinner companions ordered the beef brisket fried rice.  She also got oxtails with fried rice.  We tried to talk to the waiter and he raised his voice to tell us that it was brisket (we simply asked what kind of meat it was) and then ran off.  We flagged down a waitress that was bringing water and asked her and she said \"london broil\".  I'm sorry, but there is no way that I am mistaking oxtails for brisket (I am from TX, I know my cuts of cow) or london broil.  (Presuming that either myself or the waitress were correct, what was in my bowl is not what I ordered.)  My friend absolutely refuses to eat her food, as she doesn't mind eating ox, but just doesn't want to eat the tail.  I nibble at my food (mom used to make oxtail stew at least once a month when I was a kid, so I'm familiar) but I am not pleased.  Brisket/ London Broil does not look like medallions of meat connected by ligaments.  The meat was tender, and there were no bones, but I was reconstructing oxtails (minus the bone) on a plate on the side by the end of the meal.   Another one of our group ordered chicken chow mein.  Her meal did not arrive for 20-30 minutes after everyone else got their food, and only came out after we flagged the waitstaff down multiple times to ask about her meal.     My friend's mom ordered Soya Chicken with the chow mein noodles.  She got poached chicken (there was no way that chicken was marinated in soy sauce-- we all know what boiled chicken looks like!) and the wrong noodles.  When she asked the waiter about it, he insisted that it was soya chicken and argued with her about the noodles.    She had also ordered combination fried rice with bbq pork and chicken, only to receive rice with beef and shrimp.  She decided not to argue or ask the waiter about it because we had so many things wrong with our table's meals and no one even tried to correct it.  Ok, so I'm not one of those \"the customer's always right\" people when I go out, but for a restaurant in the Bellagio, I expected way better service.  If you are out of brisket, tell us.  Don't lie and say it is something that it is not.  Don't argue with your customers about what they ordered when you bring what is clearly the wrong thing.  This was a horrible dining experience, and I'd never repeat it again.   In Summary: Overpriced. Limited Options. Rude Waitstaff.  Unwillingness to correct errors even when confronted, to the point where the servers are lying about what is on the plate.",

Sweet and spicy noodles were particularly delicious. Main complaint was the service. Dishes arrived at different times, which is acceptable.  But a 15 minute delay between the arrival of different plates is a bit much.  Also, there was a fairly long line for seating.  However, both could possibly be attributed to the Saturday night rush. Overall, worth a visit.",

And you don't go for dim sum at a place called noodles. Go to a place called dim sum. IDIOT!  As for the chinese food, it isn't the most authentic fare out there but this isn't chinatown, it's the Bellagio and it's GOOD. The oxtail is delicious. My favorite noodle dish is the brisket, tendon, beef stew noodle soup w/ chow fun noodles. The salt and pepper prawns are large, crispy and very tasty. The duck was the best I've had in a very long time. It was a small portion but it was so damn juicy. I could've sucked on that duck all day.   After a night of losing in the casino, come in by 2 am and drown your sorrows in a bowl of delicious noodles. NOODLES! not fricken dim sum or pineapple fried rice.",

People on here complaining that this place was too expensive obviously took the wrong exit off the freeway.  (2) this is not fine dining, and if you're not already drunk, then get drunk before you go.  Noodles is a hiply decorated greasy-asian joint whose target audience is people who have been (a) drinking copiously so they are down-to-earth about food quality and just want what tastes good AND (b) having enough fun with whoever they are with that they don't need a bunch of servers checking in every 2 minutes about whether they need more ice in their icewater.  Seriously, y'all, lighten up.  There are enough stuffy, snooty restaurants in Vegas, I liked this one because it wasn't.",

What noodles (that's with a lower case \"n\") lacked in taste is pretty much compensated by its interiors. On one side are glass vessels filled with all sorts of noodles lining the entire wall. Pretty much reminded me of my biology lab in high school, you know, those glass containers filled with fetuses, bats, fishes, weird-looking animals, and other human parts. Bad memories mind you...we had this preserved cat at the beginning of the semester.  As term went along, we'd conduct various 'operations' on this cat until it was down to its skeleton.  Anyhoo where were we...the place is bright, clean yet casual.   Though the overly-priced menu, for a quick noodle house at least, covers a number of dishes from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore or Indonesia, they indeed lacked the taste, depth and spices I always look for...a bit clean and polished for my ASIAN palate...pretty much reminded me again of that cat in my lab class.   So,  off to Pho 69 I go for my $4.99 Pho Gato (Psst, so is the rumor True?)  2 stars because they have San Miguel Beer.

According to the name of the place and what I have seen online, this place is supposed to be a \"noodle house.\" Now, I didn't get around to any noodles because it was breakfast time... so being half Chinese myself, I ordered Chinese breakfast... aka Dim Sum.  As far as Dim Sum goes, they had everything I could have wanted:    - Pork Siu Mai    - Shrimp Siu Mai    - Har Gow    - Sio Pao    - Chicken Feet (gross to Americans, delicacy for Asians)  Everything was nicely prepared and tasted excellent... especially the Chicken Feet. I guess my only complaint would be that it is a little pricey (due to the number of people in our group) and that the Dim Sum was a little small in size. But as far as Dim Sum goes, the price is really going to be determined by how hungry you are since you order each item separately.  Other than that, I can't really complain. It was a wonderful break from steaks and buffets.  I will have to check them out for lunch or dinner some time.",

For a group of 4, we split 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine, and it ended up being around $120 -- not to bad compared to a lot of other places in the area, and we left very satisfied.  The food was light and flavorful without being too greasy.  For appetizers we ordered the edamame and cucumber and seaweed salad.  I personally think you can never go wrong with edamame and the cuc/seaweed salad was so refreshing!  So perfect after you've been walking the desert heat on the strip!  For our meals we split the kung pao chicken with peanuts and the sesame chicken.  Both were very flavorful and had a bit of spicyness to them, which went great with the sweet white wine we picked out.  Our server was also very attentive, friendly and knowledgable.  I'd reccommend Noodles to anyone else I know visiting Vegas",

    "text": "Just to be upfront here... American expensive over-hyped. It's not bad for tourists coming to Las Vegas I'm sure. But it's American touristic over-hyped foods. But you can expect the same across the Strip here.  My good Caucasian friend wanted to show off his favorite place. Thanks J. He had a few favorite items not found elsewhere. He loved the baked BBQ buns with sweet crust and almond fried shrimp ball especially.  It's located in Bellagio. So it was crowded with Asian tourists. The staffs spoke Cantonese. The service was great. One of the best service in USA... just a bit shy of those 4-star restaurants in Hong Kong.  I know exactly what to expect before I came here with my friend. So I can't really trash the foods here. So this was just my observation.  The foods were pricey. I didn't try the regular menu. It started from $14.95 and up. The appetizer was $7.95 and up. Side orders like preserved duck egg, starting at $3 each. My take? They are all 2-3 times the price of regular restaurants in Las Vegas. You can read my \"tasty\" reviews on other Las Vegas restaurants too.  So, here's the breakdown: Service: 4 (they were all eager to help, from push cart servers to our server Denny; very efficient and friendly) Pu-er tea with chrysanthemum: 3 (good, $2 each person) Siu Mai: 2.5 (not the best cut of meat here... too chewy with fatty meat; or not minced with the right cut of meat) BBQ bun: 3 (2 per plate; small size; it's BBQ pork pun, my friend had to order 2 plates to satisfy) Shanghai Dumpling: 0.5 (3 little one on tiny aluminum shell; $6.95 for 3; minimal juice inside; I could tell it tasted like Shanghai dumpling). Chicken feet: 3 (Well done, easy to suck off the bone; a bit too sweet... my friend commented that they didn't have to alter the \"taste\" because most Caucasians won't even look at it; server brought it to me from the kitchen and not on the cart). Egg tart: 3.5 (crispy shell) Price: 1 ($3.95, $3.95; $4.25; $4.95; $5.95...)  So diners, you've got an easy choice. Lifestyle of the rich and famous? or Chang's Dim Sum?",

I wish all asian restaurants were this nice & clean & perfect inside. (Please note my opinions are subjective) Then again does it really matter because I keep going to all the other places anyways. One of  the best things about this place is every dish or soup comes with your choice of type of noodle. I personally love the Dan Dan Noodle. It is a great place to go & eat when you are playing poker late night. I think it is the last place to get food late night. No that's wrong actually that was before the days of the Nightclubs and Fix. Never been a fan of that place though because I always felt like my dinner was getting window shopped by nosey passer-byers.",

Must have sea bass with soy and ginger. It's savory and light with extra flavor.   Shrimp dumplings!!! (Hard to mess this up)  Shrimp fried rice- also hard to mess this up. I optd for brown rice and it didn't taste as good as I expected, but I still ate it! Lol  Chicken satay! Never a big peanut fan, but the peanut-coconut sauce was everything as a dip should be.   Be advised that they don't take reservations... People wait in line at the \"bougie\" Bellagio just to eat this Seabass...at least that's what we do!",

Lobstah (with salt & pepper, chilis, garlic, and onions). (4 stars)  LOBSTAH was deep fried and quite tasty although it was just a bit salty for me. Good size portion although it is market price. I think the next time I'll just try a different version.  Shrimp dumplings. (4 stars)  This was my favorite so much so I ordered it twice! The shrimps are steamed perfectly and not mushy like a lot of other places.  The wrapper was steamed perfectly and not sticky.  XO Crabmeat Vermicelli. (4 stars)  If you love crab this is a very tasty dish. You definitely see the crab is the star!!  The vermicelli was a lighter version of noodles which helped due to the fact that we order a lot just to try a variety.  I would order this again! Especially since this is a Noodles original!!  Kung Pao Shrimp. (3 stars)  I want it to be spicy!! This unfortunately was not.  The shrimps were pretty big but it was more like a sweet and sour shrimp to me. The BF liked it.  Pork and Vegetable Dumplings. (2 stars)  My least favorite and I am a dumpling lover!!  The inside was just like a mushed up unidentifiable meat with no sign of veggies. Very disappointing.  I would not order this again.  Noodles In-House Special Spicy Sauce. (5 stars)  This sauce is awesome and it definitely has a kick to it!!   It's probably around the heat level of a Serrano pepper. I love habaneros so I wish it were spicier but nonetheless I loved it!!  ---  All in all, Noodles is a good place to get seafood.  I have never had the soups here so I can validate what the other YELPERS are saying but the service was on point for me.",

However, their braised beef noodle soup is executed well. Noodles chewy and the beef are chopstick tender.  Meaning you can pull it apart with very little effort when picking it up.    We also got steamed spare ribs, a dim sum appetizer.  Its pretty well flavored - more so from garlic rather than black bean.    One disappointment was their Macau Iced Tea, or MIT.

    "text": "Not sure what all the low ratings on here are about, but as someone who has had his fair share of really good Asian food all around Asia, Canada, and the US, I must say, this place is much better than I expected. Located in the casino area of the Bellagio, it's a great anytime place for a hot, fresh, and delicious variety of select Asian favorites. As for service, it was also much better than expected, but I guess for a 5 star Vegas hotel, they're pretty much expected to give better than average service.  The best thing about this restaurant is that we could come here anytime for a very good meal....too bad they only open at 11am or I would have come here for breakfast too.....but lunch, dinner, and late night supper worked. Service was already pretty good during our first visit, but by our second and third, the servers and hostesses recognized us, smiled more, and were more friendly the more we came back here.  So, as for the food.....oh boy.....so many yummy dishes to choose from, so few people (2 of us) to eat it all......mostly, Chinese dishes to choose from, but a bit of Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Japanese, etc......so we went ahead and ordered whatever appealed to us the most. On our first visit, we ordered the Chicken Satay (skewered) with a peanut dipping sauce, Chicken Chow Mein, Sauteed Broccoli with Garlic, and the Tempura Vegetables. The following times we came back, we ordered the Chicken Congee, Century Egg, Chinese Donut, Steamed Chicken (white meat), and Malaysian Char Kuey Teow with Chicken.  Other than the chicken satay being a bit dry, everything else was totally solid in terms of quality, freshness, and taste....deelish! I particularly enjoyed the chicken congee with Chinese donut and century egg......they are typically eaten together, but have to be ordered separately. I thought it was all very good, very comforting, and perfect as a late night supper snack!......would also have enjoyed the same as an early morning breakfast.  Ok, so the prices are not cheap for Chinese food......however, you have to remember that this is Vegas, and located on the strip.....everything here will be a heck of a lot more expensive than what you're probably used to back home......but then again, you probably shouldn't come to Vegas if you're going to cheap out.....this is just not the place for the budget conscious......or you could try the food courts in the malls, but where's the fun in that, eh? We come here to enjoy a good time and have fun....and not worry about spending a bit on good food.  The Bellagio is my regular stay place when in Vegas and I am glad Noodles is conveniently located here. Will be back again and again.",

    "text": "This is a fairly authentic Asian cafe in the heart of the Bellagio Casino. It is located just beside the Asian gaming tables.  The menu is pan-Asian, featuring options from a variety of south east and eastern Asian countries. The pho is excellent and hits the spot after an intense session at the tables or if you find yourself overserved by the drink servers. Japanese dumplings and noodles are also quite good. They also have the best Asian beer ever: Asahi Super Dry in the big bottle, cold as you like. The place was pretty well packed, and we were distracted by the excellent food, so the pictures we took during our last visit do not do the place justice.  A great place for a stop-in for lunch or dinner when at the Bellagio.",

    "text": "Missing home (Singapore), I used to make this place a must whenever I am in Vegas. The chicken rice and hor fun reminded me of home.  Well, not any more.  In July, I was in town for work, so I made a stop, bracing 109 degree heat from MGM Grand to Bellagio. I ordered the chicken rice and the wonton soup. The rice dish was bland and lacked the classic aroma. The wonton soup was flat. I was disappointed.   I brought the family back to Vegas a month later and refused to return to the restaurant, but work brought me back to Vegas again and I decided to give it one more shot. I ordered the hor fun. When the waitress asked if I wanted oyster sauce or black bean sauce, I knew I was in trouble.  The noodle was not the right type (much narrow) and was hard to the bite. The noodle was wrong. The gravy was wrong. The aroma was wrong :( Hor fun comes with clear gravy very much like the ones you find in egg drop soup. I didn't finish it.   Let's just say that I am neither going back or vouching for Noodles anymore.",

    "text": "After a LONG day of travel and exploring we were looking for something tasty before we settled in for the night.  We were in the mood for Asian and Noodles was located in the hotel next to ours so we gave it a go.  When we arrived there were a few people a head of us waiting to be seated. The hostess came out and asked how many were in our party and said it would be about a 20 min wait. I didn't check the time but good gravy that 20 mins felt like 45.  The party in front of us had a DOG with them. Not a service animal, but a tiny dog wearing a sweatshirt and complete with it's own bed and blanket. I was absolutely dumbfounded that a restaurant allowed the dog inside. How is this not a health code violation.  Anyway, on to the food. Admittedly, I'm pretty plain Jane when it comes to Asian food so I played it safe and ordered the chicken chow main. It was good but tasted pretty much like the Lo Mein I can get back home at a takeout for $7. It was not worth the hefty $18 price tag. My boyfriend ordered a beef soup that he said was good and we split some BBQ pork buns that were tasty.  The service was a bit on the slow side and they brought out my boyfriend's entree 5 minutes before mine and that's a pet peeve of mine.  All in all not a bad place but nothing to write home about and I'm still I'm shock over the dog situation.",

Served on a bed of white rice with an order of choi sum which is also cooked to perfection. The duck was so amazing we went back 2 mores times with in the next day to get that DUCK. The shrimp shumai  were huge filled with  ground pork and chunks of shrimp. The Malaysian curry with rotti was excellent also. But keep in mind if u don't like strong Indian curries you won't enjoy this dish. The rotti was amazing.  Located on the ground floor of The Bellagio hotel. Free self parking available. Best time to go is during the holiday seasons!! It is fall now was decorated so amazingly. It was like a fairytale for all ages to enjoy.",

It's comforting and delicious and I was so excited to learn we had a soup restaurant inside our hotel The Bellagio. The decor is so cool with every kind of noodle up on the walls. The staff was very friendly but a little pushy. Let me just say if there's something in the soup you want to order that you can do without prepare to feel judged and don't even think about substituting in more ingredients, that won't be aloud. But you can remove items, ya it was a lot. But the food was so delicious reason for four stars. If I'm ever in the area again I may stop in again.",

We got here 5 minutes before they opened and the line was already forming.  It didn't take very long to get seated.    This restaurant does not specialize in a particular cuisine.  They have a variety of dishes from all different countries.  There's pho, Chinese noodle dishes, dim sum, Thai noodles and more.  We were all wanting a light lunch so we ordered the Mandarin beef stew noodle soup and wonton soup.  The broth was decent.  We enjoyed the meal.  It's nothing compared to SGV or LA!!    They actually have ladies pushing dim sum carts around.  I was surprised to see that in a fancy Noodle restaurant.  We didn't really order from the dim sum menu.  We had some lotus sesame balls and the spareribs.  Both were good but a bit pricey.  But it's Vegas so everything cost 2-3 times more.    The service was good.  The food is ok if you're craving some Asian cuisine and don't feel like going outside the hotel.  Not the best but it's decent.",

We came in around 1800 and they were gettimg busy already, maybe 80% of the tables were occupied.  We ordered the following: 1.  Mai tai ($14)- heavy handed on the alcohol.  I get it, its Vegas, but was not delicious at all.  2.  Macau tea ($14)- this alcoholic beverage tasted great.  Light, sweet and refreshing.  3.  Shui Mai ($10.88)- each order had 5 pieces.  The pork was tender and juicy.  But $2 a piece is just exorbitant.   4.  Fried calamari ($13.88)- this was definitely worth it.  Yea portion size is smaller than I'm use too. But the batter is light, its not too oily, and was very crispy.  Sauces that it came with too were good.  It really made me look forward to the entrees.   5.  Roast duck  ($19.88)- this was like half a duck.  And not the crispy skin I'm use to.  But the flavors were amazing.  I dont know how they were able to get all that flavor into the meat.  And it was juicy too.  A must have when eating here.  The sauce was a perfect compliment as well.  6.  Beef stew noodle ($19.88)-  this was a very hearty dish.  Soup had so many layers of flavor.  The beef was tender.  This soup was fantastic!!!  Really warmed you up, or was it the 108  degree temp outside...  7.  Crab meat fried rice ($24.88)- largest dish we ordered, and no wonder with that price.  But they had lots of crab on top and small crunchy fish bites. It had the right amount of saltiness to make this dish perfect.  Overall the experience was good.  Drinks and food came out fast.  Service was quick.  Decor is nice also.  The aroma of the food does a great job to mask the cigarette smoke.   I still can't believe I spent $2 per shui mai when I live so close to one of the dim sum capitals of California...",

I've been suggested this restaurant by the Aria concierge. I should've known that it was biased since Aria and Bellagio belong to the same company. But there was a line in front of the restaurant which made me think it might be decent, but I was utterly deceived.   I had the Sichuan dan dan noodles. The noodles were definitely ones you'd buy from an Asian supermarket, but over cooked with no texture at all. The minced pork was very fatty; they probably got the cheapest part they could. The only other ingredient was beansprouts. The soup had no flavour, even though the menu claimed it to be spicy.  My boyfriend took the fish congee. Most watered down congee I've tasted in my entire life. It was more like a soup with some rice. It was ridiculous. I also tasted my friend's pad thai: again, no flavour and also dry. I tried some dim sum items and the chicken feet was not bad. But that was about the only item I enjoyed in my meal.  And the price. Exorbitant! The whole thing costed the four of us 150$ including tax and tips. I've never had such a disappointing 40$ meal. The service was ok and everything was clean, but combined with the quality of the food and the price, I'd say it averages out to 0.5 star.",

The dishes we get every time are - thousand year egg congee, wonton noodle soup with duck and shu mai. Their lychee martinis are an excellent drink choice.   Yes, this place is pretty spendy for what it is, but the atmosphere isn't like your typical Asian restaurant. It is clean, portions are fair, food quality is good and the servers are attentive. I wouldn't recommend going close to closing time. I did that once and did not receive the best customer service. Overall - this is a great spot for dim sum/brunch or a late night snack.",

    "text": "Coming from Los Angeles, particularly the San Gabriel area, I have pretty high standards when it comes to Asian cuisine. This was such a highly popular location and a lot of the Asians in the area recommended this as the place to eat. I figured why not since it was highly recommended and we had a black card that let us skip the line.   I must say, for a high end place in a high end casino located right next to the high rollars lounge...it was a HUGE let down. I really wanted to like this place because my friend so kindly invited us there for lunch and was very generous with sharing the meal with her family so no disrespect to her and her family.   The BBQ Pork was dry and had more burnt ends than I wanted it to, to be honest it tasted like the last batch of pork at the end of the day from a Sam Woo. The seafood chow mien was so oily we couldn't even finish eating it. The Hainan chicken was lackluster at best and the pot stickers had tough skin.   Definitely will not be eating here ever ever again.",

The steamed pork buns are small but you get 4 and they are delicious. The pot stickers were also great and hearty.   The chicken chow mein, pork spare ribs, and steamed Chinese broccoli were all very good. The pork spare ribs have a lot of meat, so much so, we couldn't finish them. Everything we had was good to great.   The service was prompt and courteous and the restaurant moves quickly to try and make your wait for a table as brief as possible.

    "text": "Almost every Vegas casino has the 24 hour cafe.  You know that restaurant that stays open all night, after the real restaurants have closed, to feed the late night crowd.  It usually has a little of everything, but nothing that stands out.  Food for sustenance, not for pleasure.   Noodles is the Asian version of that cafe, only it closes at 3am.  A variety of random Asian dishes, some better than others, but nothing that stands out or that you'd want to go back for.    I had the double happiness with BBQ pork and roast duck.  It's a dish with all meat, so I ordered a small bowl of rice on the side.  If you get the fried rice with duck, it's 90% rice, 10% duck.  The dish was $22.50 and while overpriced, still the best plate on the table.  Both meats were tender and flavorful.  You could easily order this dish and share among 2 people.  Well worth it.    My hb got the laksa curry noodle.  It was a decent sized bowl, was steaming hot, but a bit on the fishy side for me.  More fishy, less curry.  Not my favorite.    Our friend got the braised beef brisket rice.  He said it was good, but not great.  It was more of a meal for one as opposed to a dish to share, so plan accordingly.    We also tried the tempura shrimp and at $12.75 came with 4 pieces.  They were decent sized, and done well, but easily something you could get anywhere else.    Service was just ok.  It seemed there were many servers, but a lot of waiting around.  We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't bothered by it, but I did see a server straight up eating behind the counter, then with food still in her mouth and chewing, she picked up a few dishes and served them.  Kinda weird.    Decent food, Vegas and Bellagio mark ups, ok service.  Average all around.",

Tasty yet you don't walk away feeling stuffed or bloated after eating them. However, also ordered the wonton noodle soup. They provide good number of shrimp wontons but broth was bland and served in a small soup bowl. Noodles in the soup were more than adequate however they tried to pack the noodles with the wontons in a small bowl, with little to no soup that the noodles get swollen if you don't eat the dish quickly. Also ordered Garlic sauteed pea shoots were average. But this side dish can complement an entree for 3-4 ppl. Vegetable dumplings were ok. Service is good.",

Also the bowls are really small compared to other Pho/ ramen restaurants the only plus side of this is it's conveniently in the hotel. They are open till 2am. They serve both pho and ramen. I like pho, bf likes ramen so that worked out really well. Try it if you don't mind spending extra. But even if you don't mind I would suggest to go elsewhere",

After a short 10 minute wait (while checking out the exorbitant price gouging on the menu....$9 dimsum?! $18 beef noodle soup?!), we were seated. The service was quite prompt.  As a group of starving Asian girls - you do NOT keep us waiting for our food. Our entrees took quite some time to make, even though they told us everything was already pre-made. As a result, we were forced to order a variety of the aforementioned pricey dim sum. The dim sum wasn't terrible; we shared the turnip cakes, spare ribs, and two zhong zi. For the price of those few dishes we could have had a FEAST back in NYC. But I digress.  Finally the noodles come out & the portions are deceivingly big! The noodle soup bowls look small, but are actually quite deep. The dry noodle dishes are definitely large - can definitely feed 2 people and keep them full. I had the Laksa noodles; coconut broth was heavenly, but I struggled to find enough of my broad flat noodles in there =( We also ordered a side dish of steamed bok choy, oyster sauce on the side (cus we health conscious like that! ;D). That was $9. Insane! But oh-so-good after a weekend of eating potato chips.   Their last saving grace was the Viet Iced Coffee! It was not overly sweet, but had just enough caffeine kick in there to help us through our 3 hour sleep the night before.   Bottom line - overpriced Chinese food, but gets the job done. Split the dishes.",

The shiu mai was pretty good.  It was 4 pieces of steamed pork and vegetable dumplings.  I noticed there was cooked tobiko caviar on top.  yum.  the crab noodles were okay.  they used rice noodles with a lot of pieces of crabs.  a little bland but we put soy sauce on it.  the food was pretty good.  For our pot of tea, an orange juice, 1 appetizer, and 1 noodle, our total was $44 without tip.  I thought it was a little over priced considering the quality and how much food we got.  The type of asian food they had were thai, vietnamese, japanese, and korean.  some of the items were ridiculously priced.  for example, vietnamese rice porridge was $13 when normally it would be only $5.  Your an idiot if you order rice in broth water for that much.  My other complaint was that the restaurant was extremely cold.  It was uncomfortable.  Overall, the food is good, but definitely not worth the price.  Nothing exquisite about this place.",

We got to the entrance and we wouldn't have minded the 10-15 minute wait, but the place was nearly empty! We also saw a waitress lounging around, picking at her nails right outside. Once inside, we ordered and everything is fine until our food comes. We knew that being on the strip, it wasn't going to be cheap but boy, compared to other restaurants on the strip, we got jacked! Appetizers were okay, my noodle soup had hardly any taste to it and was pretty small and one of my friend's meat dish was mostly fat! We said something (in a calm manner) to the guy waiter about it and he gave us the worst attitude for the rest of the night! Very unprofessional and being a native Las Vegan, I am very disappointed. After this, I'm definitely not coming back to Noodles and it'll be a long while before I come back to the Bellagio!",

    "text": "Here is how to eat cheaply on the Vegas Strip. Well, relatively cheaply. Eating at McD would be the truly cheap option, but I thought we were on vacation, were we not? The answer to eating relatively cheaply on the Vegas Strip is... wait for it (don't worry, I won't switch to commercial break on you. Please, I am not Gordon Ramsay)... Noodles at Bellagio.  Noodles is an Cantonese restaurant located right off the Bellagio casino floor. Super duper convenient, if I do say so myself. Noodles specializes in Cantonese cuisine. Decor wise, Noodles was simple and humble, nothing extravagant in comparison to the other Bellagio restaurants.   We liked Noodles so much, we ate here twice during our short trip to Vegas. The first time was on a Sunday, where they went the traditional route and had Dim Sum cart service. This is when the restaurant makes a bunch of small plates, stack them on a cart and have a waiter/waitress push the cart around the restaurant floor, where patrons can flag down the cart and order a small plate directly from the cart. Even though this is the traditional way, I have never been a fan. You can only choose what's on the cart and it's often served luke warm. Okay, I'll stop my complaining now. Moving on, we had the pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings and fried radish cake. Both were luke warm (of course they were! this method is flawed). The pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings had great flavours, despite being slightly oily. The radish cake was not the best I have had.  We also shared the Wonton Noodle and the Roasted Duck Rice. What I loved about the Wonton Noodle is that the wonton fillings were all shrimp, giving each wonton a great springy bite and also making this a light dish. The Roasted Duck Rice was awesome. When I ordered it, the waitress asked me \"with bone or boneless?\" You can get boneless roasted duck on rice? This is brand new information to me. I was impressed. Cantonese style BBQ duck served on rice is a pretty common dish and being a BBQ-duck-lover, I have had it many times from various restaurants. I have never been offered the option of going boneless before. I can finally, for the first time in my life, eat roasted duck on rice like a proper lady with no need to wrestle the meat off the bone with my teeth and channelling my inner animal self while gnawing on the bone. I do paint a vivid image, don't I? ;) The duck was delicious, nice and fatty, just how I like it. I ordered it again on our second visit.  I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you are spending your day gambling at the Bellagio casino floor. ;) I recommend saving this restaurant for a weekday lunch, because I think Noodles and The Buffet are the only restaurants open for lunch service at the Bellagio on a weekday.  Please visit my blog, where I documented my recent trip to Las Vegas. I have food photos! Thank you for your time. :)  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsimplygluttonous.blogspot.ca%2Fsearch%2Flabel%2FLas%2520Vegas&s=7b5b1847af45984940b4f80f0399af9ffc8d1a3829b3822cf6d229cf573263a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">simplygluttonous.blogspo...</a>",

After standing in line for lengthy time, we finally were ushered into the restaurant and given a table that had been open the entire time we stood waiting, and had actually asked why no one was given that table. Food was excessively slow in arriving, one meal brought out at a time with major gap in between meals delivered. Worst offense was that one member of our party of 4 was NEVER brought his meal. Our waiter NEVER came to our table to check on our meal. When we finally flagged someone down to check on the missing meal, our waiter appeared and said it somehow was overlooked. Within 5 minutes the meal appeared miraculously. Total time for dinner once seated inside restaurant 2 hours. Totally ridiculous and definitely not worth our time and trouble. To boot, one dish ordered with no spice was delivered spicy. Do not waste your time for mediocre food. Go somewhere else.",

We arrived before 6 PM and already the line was spilling into the casino. Although noodles are the featured item, entrees of chicken, pork and beef are included on the menu. Wingz are a standout appetizer -- cutsey name aside, bone-in wings are encased in a really cripsy, spicy crust. Shrimp temupura were large and the flavor was exactly what you'd expect. XO noodles with lump crabmeat is a rich dish of noodles and large chunks of fresh crab. Service is prompt and friendly and you won't be rushed. A must if you are in the bellagio and craving some Asian cuisine",

Fresh from playing cards from Caesars, my buddies wanted some asian noodles in the bellagio. The wait to get in was about 20-30mins. I wasn't pissed at line to get in (other people in the line were, especially a group of trekkies?)   I mean its Vegas and gamblers have to eat sometime?   So, we sat down ordered and I decided to go with some spicy chicken noodle dish. It was quite hot and spicy when I tasted it. It took a total of 5 mins for them to muster it up. I was shocked at the cooking times of this noodle joint and I think I knew why.... Because 10mins after my meal, I could not hold it down. I spent prolly the next hour in the casino's well maintained bathrooms. I was hurling my brains out and spewing chunks.   This was one of the worst food experiences.",

Got edamame, veggie spring rolls, deep fried tofu, veggie tempura, pad thai and also ordered the steamed vegetables.  The appetizers were pretty good - they came out quick and hot.  I was really looking forward to the pad thai, being a thai food fanatic, however it was my least favorite dish.  It didn't taste like pad thai at all, and reminded me more of a sub par pad see ew. The veggies were healthy (yet a bit flavorless) and served in a bamboo steamer.  Overall, great service, but certain foods were hit and miss.",

Albeit completely overpriced, but when you're paying 10 dollars for a fucking hot dog at a place called Snacks and you don't want to drive 15 minutes to Chinatown, paying an extra 4 more for a good bowl of noodles is a no-brainer.   Long story short, I love this place. This is the only place I eat when I play poker at the Bellagio. This is the only place my dad eats at too. All their noodle soups are awesome. Wonton noodle soup, Mandarin beef noodle soup, I feel like I'm in Hong Kong again. Except it's slightly nicer and the money is paid in US dollars. Their roti prata is also quite good.   Reading some of the other reviews, it seems that price is an unforgivable issue. Get over yourselves people. You're in Vegas. It's the Bellagio. Everything is overpriced. If you're staying here and complaining about the price of a coke, maybe you should have stayed at Bill's Casino and Saloon instead.",

When we got to the Bellagio, there was a line for the restaurant, but menus were posted so you could read while you waited. And the person in charge of the line was very efficient at seating people.  When we got our table, two of us immediately ordered ridiculous cocktails called White Tigers that might not have technically gone with the Chinese food we ordered, but were nonetheless delightful.  One of the people in our group ordered the pad thai dish people were slagging, and we both liked it. I tell you this, friends, having eaten some pad thai in my day.  My dish was a bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy which is exactly up my alley, especially since it came with white rice that I could just ignore and so had a fighting chance of finishing my food. (The people that order noodles will need to share or take some home.)   The bean curd (like fried tofu pieces) and shiitake mushrooms were great, and they cooked the bok choy like you're supposed to, so they're still tender-crisp instead of being overcooked into little puddles of limp green sadness.  After my cocktail I ordered coffee, which might have been The Best Cups Of Coffee I've Ever Had. I wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the day.   Considering we're talking about Las Vegas, the prices were typical. Maybe we made lucky food choices, but we enjoyed ourselves!",

Servers were pretty quick to greet and offer drinks.    2 dishes we tried were:  (1)  Hor Fun, with Beef, Shrimp, &  Oyster Sauce.    These types of noodles are normally crispy, not shoggy like spaghetti.   If you asked me rate, i'd give this dish a 1 on a 5 scale  (2) Singapore Curry Rice Vermicelli, Shrimp and Shredded Pork.   On this day,  this dish was the saltiest we've even had.  Appear they may have dropped a bottle of salt in the dish.   The only compliment I can give is the 3 shrimp pieces in the dish were of jumbo size, and not the tiny shrimps one normally gets.   Giving this dish also a 1 out of 5.  both dishes above with 1 beer,  came out to about $ 45 without tip.",

So I headed to the closest nail spa to my hotel,  where the seemingly crazy woman who swore that the 80 dollar treatment she was about to do give my distressed footsies, was going to make walking in my shoes that night 10 times easier, only after she insisted she needed to add another 20 bucks to my treatment because my feet were just THAT effed up!  So after a few minutes of my \"ultimate feet pampering\" I dont know why, but I felt the need to ask this crazy woman where was a good place to have lunch on the strip, without having her send me to a burger joint.  So she suggested Noodles @ the Bellagio.  So first thing I think.....Bellgio? Expensive? then I think......whatever, its vegas, everythings expensive.  So I head there for lunch, and upon arrival, before your server even comes to your table, you are offered a small plate of dim sum, which we accepted, and it was absolutely deelish,  we then order a large sapporo ( which I love cuz its totally share-able) we shared a noodle plate which was a great idea because it was huge,  I was overall very pleased with everything, great place for lunch in Vegas.",

    "text": "I eat at Noodles fairly often while I am spending time in Bellagio for poker tournaments. It's a solid meal for sure, and if it were cheaper I would give it 4 stars.  Service is always better than I expect it to be, but as is standard in many Asian restaurants, you'll sometimes wait around for a long time (for more water, for your check, etc) unless you wave down a server. It's not something to complain about really, just something you have to get used to.  They serve my favorite dish in the world, Hainanese Chicken Rice, but it's not a very good version of it really. Nonetheless, it's the main course of my \"last meal\" fantasy, so I order it almost every time. I've also really enjoyed the Chicken Curry (be careful of bones, and once I got a huge chunk of ginger in my order), Malaysian Fried Rice, and every noodle dish I've ever tried. I don't recommend other stir-fried dishes or fried-meat-with-sugary-sauce dishes (e.g. sesame chicken), as they rate only slightly better than Panda Express.  Noodles is alright, and I'm going to continue going there on a regular basis, whenever it's far more convenient than popping over to Chinatown on Spring Mountain. However, if Chinatown is just as convenient, I'll take anything there over Noodles, every day of the week.",

It's crowded but not uncomfortable.  The settings are nice, the decor is tasteful and well done.  Everything thing seems clean and well maintained - something very important to me. Even when a bustle you can hear your company, so that's good.  Pleasant restaurant to spend lunch in.  The wait staff was nice.  From the attentive, quiet but nice waiter to the dim sum cart women - we were served in a timely, nice fashion.  Don't expect or a chatty server but the job is done and done right.  Something I appreciate in a busy restaurant.  I had the pork buns from the dim sum chart.  It was perfectly done and the pork was sweet, savory and I couldn't help but eat 2!  I ordered the chicken curry.  It came in a soup type dish, cute presentation.  It was soooooo good!  Amazing flavors, a little spicy and honestly the best curry I've had.  The chicken just fell off the bone and I ate every last bit.  The amazing food was well complimented by the cute decor and nice staff.  I will definately go again when in Vegas!",

Some of the dishes can get pricey but its the bellagio don't expect less! I just wish it was open late late night. It would be perfect for coming after partying.

The food was also very bland, and had no flavor at all. the price point is probably the only thing i can say was okay, because the portion size was good size This was very upsetting because my friends and I all do like Chinese food but this was the worst experience with Chinese food I have had. My recommendation would be skip this place and hit up Panda Express, just as good of service but better food.",

For some reason, I think she didn't like me because I wanted warm water.  When I asked for the said item, she responded with \"We have tea - jasmine, oolong, etc.\"  I asked her again, \"Do you have warm water?\"  She says, \"Yes, but we have tea.\"  OK, I get the fucking point.  You have tea and you're trying to charge me for it, but I don't fucking want it.  Whilst taking my order, Cindy didn't understand when I pointed to what I wanted and specified \"chicken.\"  Because instead, she tells me i can choose from bbq pork, duck, or chicken.  I said, yeah that chicken.    OK, that wasn't even the worse part.  When she brought back everyone's dishes, my order was missing.  However, she had a two bbq item rice plate in her hand.  I realized the person next to me had switched her order at the last minute, and Cindy the server must have accidentally switched my order.    Cindy hands me the rice plate and says \"Here you go.\"  I told her, \"I didn't order this.  You must have accidentally switched my order out instead of the person next to me.\"  Cindy responds with, \"You don't want this?\"  I said, \"NO, I didn't order this.  I ordered the poached chicken rice noodle.\"  Cindy says \"Oh.\" and runs off.  She does indeed come back with the right order, but never offers an apology.  She gave me a fat attitude during the whole damn time.  And the noodles?  Well, I've had better.  And it never cost me $13.50.  I would never recommend Noodles to anyone.",

Quality of the food was nothing special, which made it harder to pay so much for mediocre chinese food.  Good clean decor and service though.

The Restaurant is actually very pretty inside and very well decorated. The food I have to say it was very good and A LOT. We had some to go as well. The service was the only ok thing there. Not that good. Maybe because they are always busy, but it was nothing special.  If they were a little more attentive they would have a better rating.",

He started charging an extra $1 for .2 oz packets of soy sauce and 1/10th of a to go cup of hot sauce. Yep $1 and they fill it 1/10th of the way up. Atleast thry realized after a few weeks maybe we shouldnt charge for the soy sauce cause fuck thats right we are an asian restraunt and people use soy sauce on almost every dish. Last straw got Singapore noodles tonight and now they only give u 1 shrimp instead of 2. JUST BAD BUSINESS AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOBODY SUPPORT THIS DUMB POS. U LOST MY BUSINESS AND MANY MORE OVER SOMETHING THAT COST U MAYBE 3 FUCKING CENTS. IF U DO GO ASK FOR MANAGER AND PISS ON HIS FUCKING SHOE",

We all ordered their Roast Duck rice and Chinese broccoli ($16.75) which definitely hits the spot. The rice is service piping hot, and the duck was pretty flavorful, albeit a bit fatty as expected. Portions are average in size, more of a personal-size which may or may not fill you up if you're hangry.  Service is quick, as we were seated quickly and our food also came out quickly. Any special requests will most likely not be honored, so don't set your expectations too high.  Overall everything here is pretty average, but not bad per se. It's hard to stomach the prices, as I've enjoyed delicious beef stew noodles in LA for 1/3 of the price as the beef stew noodles on their menu ($18.95 R U SRS BRAH?!).",

They are open till 2:00am which is great for a late night meal. The service was superb and the food excellent! We tried the calamari, light and delicious. Spicy cucumbers were yummy as well. For the entree's, we chose sweet and spicy noodles, a veggie dish and a crab noodle dish. All were SO good! So good, that we went back the following evening! We'll definitely come back on our next visit to Vegas.",

I got the Penang Kuay Teow with beef and it was a decent portion. The beef was tender but the noodles were not cooked well. Still kind of hard and no char that rice noodles need. Flavorwise it was lacking. All you tasted was spice and grease. My friend got the wonton noodles and hated it and said the same thing about the noodles not being cooked enough. The sesame chicken was decent though. Service wise it was ok and the lines here can get long. I would rather take my $20 and spend it elsewhere",

The bowl of wanton noodle soup was actually very tasty.  The issue I have are the two appetizers we ordered. The fried calamari were chewy and tasteless. The egg rolls were kinda mushy in the center and once again lack flavor.  Paying for good overpriced wanton is one thing but getting over charge for poorly made flavorless fried food is reason enough to go try another place next time I'm in town.   4 star for noodles  1 star for egg rolls and calamari  4 star for service",

Surprisingly most of the staff spoke Cantonese so it gave us more confidence about this place. Was here for lunch so we had dim sum. It's the old school kind where they push a trolley around and you pick your dim sum from the trolley. Some of the dim sum are not hot enough, but the food is actually quite decent!   We were really satisfied about lunch so we decided to come back for dinner!! Ordered a Wonton Noodle and Hainanese Chicken Rice. Both are above average and our Asian tummies are just so happy!

The first time I ordered a rice porridge with fish, which comes with a bowl of about 20cm diameter and good for two person (please keep this in mind, as it will be referred later). I am a person with high tolerance on the service, but the food tastes ok, so I decided to give it another try. And the second time blew my mind. For the second time, we were seated and no one took our order for quite a while (I raised my hand for 2-3mins). After our order, we waited our food for 30mins and I asked a server to help check on our order. The server rudely replied that the food was being processed without even checking!!  We ordered a rice porridge similar to the one we had for the first time, and I specifically asked if it was the same size as the fish porridge and got confirmed by our server. However, the porridge came with a much smaller bowl about half size as the first time (around 12cm diameter. and it is just one person serving). So I asked if there is mistake. The server brought back a larger bowl and said that they sometimes use large bowls and sometimes use small ones, and asked if we want to switch to a big bowl by pouring the porridge into it! I was like \"What?\" I regret to come to this place, and would not recommend the place if you want to enjoy your trip in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Show me the noods is basically how I chose to wake up the morning of this outing to Noodles at Bellagio. It was Vegas and all. Haha   Joking aside this experience had hits and misses, but overall it was just average to me hence my 3 star rating (very rare for me, but I'm truthful nonetheless).  We went right as they opened and it looks like it actually gets full rather quickly. The dining area wraps around the corner which was actually surprising as its deceptively small from the outside, but thought it was neat.  I can't necessarily knock the service because it is True to most you'll inhabit. My wife was actually pretty upset, but when I explained how things go (sorry for the vagueness just being careful with how I'm phrasing this) she simmered down. Haha.  The food for me was good although nothing stood out and separated itself from competition. The vegetable spring rolls were crunchy yet soft on the inside which was a plus, but again flavor wise it tasted like one you could get anywhere.  I had the xo crabmeat vermicelli and I left just wanting a hot dog to be honest. I expected certain things to pop out, but to me mine was bland. I was eating the crab, but there really wasn't even much of a crab taste so it just felt like I was eating tofu or something like that which was a bummer since that's the star of the dish. I will say the portion was enough for a to go box which at least says portion size is worth the price tag. It benefited me since I had a fridge in the room so it provided dinner so win win there.  With so many options lurking around I wouldn't rule out another visit here, but if I am caught with a craving I see myself being a creature of habit and staying in Blossom (at Aria) for an Asianic culinary jackpot. However, this is only me and as I always say weigh it out and create or don't create your own experience (the beauty of Yelp).",

The decor is unique with thatched wall hangings and a goldish bronzeyish sculpture every so many feet.  On the opposite wall are shelves of noodle filled jars and other dried ingredients.  We got here past 10 pm so The Buffet had already stopped at The Bellagio.  A few restaurants were closing at 11 pm but this one remains open for business til 2 a.m. on Friday nites.  I ordered Beef Stew Noodles.  The meat was hearty cut in huge chunks not bite sized.  I ate all of the meat.  I did not recognize any tendon in my bowl.  The noodles were very different in taste and texture.  Hubs had mild Mongolian beef and even though it was spicy for his palate it was gone in no time.  The thai iced coffee tasted as good as it looked. Ordered lychee and almond float but had to ask for it 3 times.  The server said, not good tonite I show you.  The color of the lychee was darker but edible.  The float was delicious.  We got that comp.  Be prepared for loud, perhaps intoxicated diners next to you.  Guess families with young toddlers must also be guests of the hotel to be up and eating at that hour.",

The first bite was ok but as you continue to eat it it gets better and better.  The fried rice wasn't as great, not enough soy sauce but that's OK because you can just add it while you eat. It did taste fresh.   Service: good but a little slow towards the end. They were very busy.   Price: definitely the best in Bellagio's for a dine-in restaurant. There were many other items on the menu for Asian cuisine that I wanted to try. They had variety. Our dishes were $19.95 and for reference the pho was $19.95 too.   Ambiance: small but very nice decor and clean. Can get a little noisy.   I wish we found this place sooner during our stay!",

We ordered the Pork Noodle Soup and Pork Fried Rice.  The Pork Fried Rice was delirious!  Not sure what was in the soup, but it wasn't what expected.  The pork was long strips which you couldn't eat without cutting them up.  The broth was also unique and didn't taste the good to us.   When we were finished, flagging down our server for the bill was challenging.  I finally went up the counter and asked for the receipt.    Being in the Bellagio, it's not inexpensive, but I expected better service, hence the two stars.  Sometimes with Asian food, our American expectations don't always equal Chinese ones so you might find the Pork Noodle Soup to be amazing, but since no one checked on us after delivering our food, it have to resort to Yelp to let them know my thoughts.",

I had the shrimp wonton noodle soup this time around and it was just what I needed at the end of a long day.  Hot, fresh and delicious.    The pot stickers were really fat and tasty.. damn I love a dumpling of any kind...but cold in spots.  I'm sure they're premade earlier in the day and then steamed to heat up beforehand.   These were likely not steamed long enough.. still good though.   My friends also enjoyed their veggie fried rice and shrimp tempura.  Plus wine and cocktails.  Yes it's a little pricey but you're at the Bellagio.  It's part of the deal.   Will undoubtedly be back.",

It did have lump crab meat in it but I am certain the rice was worth maybe ten dollars, I don't even think it would have been that much in Hawaii, and I am pretty use to everything being over priced.   It was good, really good actually but I can't get behind \" good \" that is over priced for  no reason. The service was solid and my lychee martini was okay. Noting to write home about. The Steamed pot stickers were pretty good. Three solid stars means the hesitation I would have in returning would be the over priced rice.  I do not mind spending money on great quality food however this rice is no different than what you would get down the street at your local Chinese food restaurant. The main difference is the rice that I decided to get had a lump crab meat in it so yes I do think that that should affect the price a bit but not $24.   in fact I would've even been a bit more OK if the portion that came out was enough so me and my friend could've split it. When I saw the price that is kind of what I assume I figured it cost so much because it's a huge portion and I was very disappointed in how much food came out for how much I paid.",

We had the fried pot stickers and spring rolls that were delicious and fresh, and came out super quick. There were 4 of us and we each had a different dish, soy flavored noodles, special fried rice, sweet and spicy noodles and can't remember the last one.   All were good! Fresh, yummy flavor, but  the dishes were very plain and simple for the price, and the reputation of the restaurant. I was surprised and expected a little more. Maybe more ingredients, vegetables, herbs, 3 of our dishes were just the noodles, seasoning, and meat. If the dishes were half the price I would have no complaints, but you don't really get what you pay for in this case. These prices are probably expected in Bellagio restaurants. The service was great, and the restaurant is very uniquely decorated. We came with my grandpa in a wheel chair and everyone was very friendly and accommodating.",

Noodles were good. -beef chow fun: pretty good too, oily but flavorful. -BBQ char siu/ pork and duck: oily but flavorful! -fried rice: surprisingly delicious.

I usually have to drive out to the Chinatown area so I liked the convenience of having authentic Asian food right here on the strip. Had to put it to the test and see if it was truly authentic.  When I arrived, I was seated shortly after waiting a few minutes. The host and staff up front are definitely more service oriented than the servers they have running this place. The servers didn't make eye contact with you and wanted to get you in and out. For two people, we ordered the soy sauce chicken / duck combo, the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and the pan fried dumplings. Overpriced for sure but I wouldn't have expected otherwise at the Bellagio.   The food was authentic and tasted pretty amazing! It came out quick and the noodle soup was very hot. I thought the chicken and duck had great flavor. Portions were medium - large. We still had food leftover. Definitely give it a try. I would go back for the food.",

It's a bit pricier than your usual Chinese restaurant, but you're on the strip and in the casino, so expect to pay a bit more!  Plus, the waitresses actually greet you and provide some decent customer service!   The menu is pretty extensive, offering a variety of dim sum items, soups, seafood and rice dishes. We ordered the won ton soup, lap cherng (chinese sausage) fried rice and curry chicken and all the dishes were tasty!   The decor is beautiful as well, with jars of ingredients laid out on the walls. It's a friendly restaurant with a friendly staff. I would totally recommend that you check out this place! :)",

    "text": "3.5 for food and 0.5 alone for good service.  After half an hour of reading Yelp reviews and deliberating over whether we wanted to pay higher than LA prices for Asian cuisine , we sucked it up and decided to give Noodles a try.    Decor and ambience: not at all pretentious.  Moderate Asian influence, minimalist decor, and comfortable atmosphere.  Seating is away from the gaming floor so you forget you are at a casino.  Food: had the sweet and spicy noodle and Mandarin beef stew.  Flavors were good and meat was flavorful and tender.  The place is known for its wonton soup, but we were not in the mood for it this evening.  Looking around at other tables, classic dishes like the fried rices and BBQ pork looked excellent.  The menu is a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese flavors / dishes.  Service: excellent - we arrived hungry and ready to over order.  To our surprise, and in an environment where we expect to be upsold, our waiter was extremely helpful in deciding how much to order and flat said No when I wanted to get a third dish, Lol.  This was a huge service because being on vacation, I would have had no where to keep the leftovers.  All staff were courteous and very accommodating as well.  Portion size is relative.  Contrary to many of the reviews in Yelp, we found the portions to be adequate.  Granted I don't eat like I used to in college, but two entrees are enough for two average sized bellies to leave feeling slightly uncomfortably full.",

    "text": "Welcome to Noodles, where Asian food is as expensive as a French restaurant, but as disappointing as a microwave dinner! A place that serves Chinese, Thailand, Vietnamese, Singapore, and Malaysian food, and turn them into a mouthful of MSG with a little hint of regret!  -Actually that's all you have to know about this place, but if you're curious about my experience here then continue reading:  Singapore's national dish is called Hainanese Chicken Rice, and since my girlfriend and her brother grew up there, it has become a craving to have this dish every once in a while (like how we crave for french fries every so often). Anyway we've visited several places that serve this dish all over Vegas and decided to try a more upscale restaurant on the strip instead of the cheap local places we usually go to.  Noodles is located inside the Bellagio Casino, and as soon as we got there we saw a long line outside the restaurant, which I take as a good sign since people line up just to eat here.  Now this is where everything turns into a disaster. The friendly waitress was showed us to our seats, took our order, even gave us hints on how they serve their dishes. she left and returned later with our appetizers.   I ordered some Calamari, Chinese Sesame Balls and Roti Prata.  The Calamari was served with a sweet and chili sauce. The breading was nice and crunchy and the calamari was soft. It had a bit of curry taste and it was the only delicious thing we had that night.  Roti Prata is a Malaysian dish, it's basically a flaky flat pastry that you dip into a curry sauce, and is actually one of my favorite apps (not here though). The pastry was not flaky, it was tough and chewy. The dip had too much Turmeric and tasted powdery.  The Chinese sesame balls tasted like Chinese sesame balls..   Our Waitress then returned with our main dishes; The Hainanese Chicken Rice and a Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle. (note: this is the last time we would see our waitress.)  The Hainanese Chicken Rice was served with  chicken stock soup,  chicken flavored rice (which was dry and bland), the boiled chicken (of course) and accompanied by the 3 sauces: the red chilli-garlic sauce, a ginger-garlic sauce, and instead of the thick black sauce they usually serve with it, they serve it with soy sauce....... why not be creative and serve it with oyster sauce? it's thick, it's black, and the flavor makes more sense than soy sauce you lazy chefs!   I don't even want to talk about the Mandarin Beef Stew..... The noodles were old, the soup tasted like tap water infused with MSG which made my head hurt the rest of the night and left an itch on my tongue..  The beef was tough...   We didn't even bother for dessert..  When It was time to pay, all three servers were just talking and laughing at the host table. We felt so ignored... They didn't even fill up any of our drinks to wash the filth we just ate.  Our Dinner was $106",

My fav spot to have a bowl of egg wonton noodle soup when I need a break from Pai-Gow.                  This time it was brunch Dim Sum with my folks, no gambling on this trip. We came 10 minutes before 11AM when they open. There was a few people in front of us. By 11:30 AM, the line was 45 minutes wait on a SAT lunch?!?!                 We ordered the same thing each time we are here:  - Wonton egg noodle soup - the egg noodles made fresh daily, super fine, Cantonese style, served with shrimp wonton, & cabbage. The broth is nice & the wonton is fine.   - Roasted Duck egg noodle soup - the duck got no fat between the skin & the meat, tender, free range duck. My dad loves it.  - Calamari with Thai sweet and spicy dipping sauce - nice snack.  - Dim Sum - Fung chao chicken feet & XIu Mai prok dumplings are mu FAV. Shrimp balls were equally good!  -Stir fried garlic pok choy.  - & Cafe Sua Da - Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.                   This NOODLES shop by far is the most consistent noodles in all the high end hotels around here, better than Red8 @ Wynn or 9Noodles @ Caesars or even Mandalay Bay!                 All noodles soup runs between $14-$17, consider it's cheap for 5 stars hotel, stop complaining on the cos people! It's the Bellagio! To me it hits the spot when I need it & for me, that's priceless!                 Service is always good here, some servers even remember us. Not sure if that's a good thing!",

The only thing I have ordered here and will only order here is the melt in your mouth \"Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle!\"  This aromatic soup has tender beef brisket and tendon, which were stewed to perfection.  It comes in a bowl of soup with perfectly cooked noodles and baby bok choy.  With a spoonful of the hot chili sauce, this is my favorite noodle in the world.  Actually, I have tried the turnip cake here and I have to say, it is the best turnip cake I have ever eaten.  It was pan fried nicely, with a hint of crispiness on the outside, and still warm and delicious inside.    I have been here a total of 4 times, and every time, there is a long line.  Oh well, worth the wait for the best bowl of soup ever.",

We ordered the Hong Kong style noodles with pork and Roast Duck. The waiter was very attentive. Our water glasses were always full. As for the dinner, the Hong Kong style noodles were soaking in sauce that had a weird flavor. The noodles were really thin for egg noodles. If they were thicker, I think it wouldn't have absorbed all the sauce. The duck was excellent, boneless and full of flavor. This was the second time we ate there...don't think we'll be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Came here with my family for a light lunch, and our experience was strange.   Started by ordering a Thai Iced Tea. I asked our server if they could substitute the regular milk for soy milk. She told me no... Something about the tea having lots of sugar, plus the sugar in the soy milk... Just too much sugar. Um, what? That doesn't make any sense. It's easy to sub soy in any milk-based drink. I do it all the time. If the drink was pre-mixed with regular milk already, then I can understand. But you're telling me no bc you think I think it'll taste too sugary with soy? Soy doesn't typically have lots of sugar. It's a fine substitute. What if I like lots of sugar, anyhow? I don't. But the point is... It's my drink, personalized to my tastes, and the server doesn't know me... So let me order it how I want to.   After losing that battle, we ordered our food. My dad got the Noodle Soup with Chicken and again, we got another wonderful recommendation from our server: \"That's not my favorite. It's too light and not very good.\" Thanks? We know she meant well, but there may have been a bit of a language barrier (it sounded like she didn't know English very well.) Her recommendations were probably helpful in her eyes, but to us, they sounded discourteous. Luckily my family and I are laid back and we just laughed it off.   Food: Dad got the Noodle Soup, as requested, and it was actually pretty good. A little bland, but not bad. Same for the Wonton Soup and the Cantonese Dumpling Soup. The fried rice was basic. Don't bother. On the better side... the Shiu Mai and the Sesame Balls.   Side note: Lunch time gets packed. We waited over an hour to dine (which was expected. Things are always crowded at peak times.) The restaurant is also small, and the workers move at a snail's pace.",

It needed some little pop of color like a red or bright green here or there. The wall of noodles was nicely done. Strangely, Noodles was pretty brightly lit for the time of night and the sort of small, intimate feel the place almost had.   My group was comprised of three couples. Couple one ordered some white chicken and broccoli noodle dish that they really liked. Boyfriend and I/the 2nd couple got potstickers, miso, and pad Thai off the Pre-Fixe menu. All tasty! I loved the miso flavor--the saltiness was perfect. The postickers were okay, I'm not sure if they were sausage or what but the meat was kinda pink. Pad Thai was great--they used wide noodles in this dish, so that was a change but one I liked.  The table was kind of cool looking at first--it had a low tube backing. Downside to it was that all three of us on one side slammed our knees into the table leg getting out! I've got a big ol' bruise from that now.",

Great for lunch. Pricey $$$$$ but worth it. Great decor. Very bright. Thai ice tea, Satay chicken, cucumber salad, Chilean Sea Bass, Kung Pao chicken and PAD THAI NOODLES with shrimp are a MUST. No reservations needed.  I highly recommend this place.",

Will encounter a little bit of a language barrier if you don't listen carefully. Other than that, very friendly staff.   I ordered a few from their (short) dim sum list. It was dinner time, so it was expected. I also tried their much talked about Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup. Amazing. Very flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and tender beef.   My friend had the lobster special and enjoyed that as well.   Prices were moderate for a place like Vegas.   I'd visit again to try some other items.",

One was more obnoxious than the other. Walking up and down the length of the restaurant wailing \"DIM SUM!\" through their noses. We tried to order some dim sum, only to have a long order sheet tossed in our laps as she walked away. Then she sneezed. Big, loud, wet, NOT covering her mouth. OMG so gross.   Pot stickers were delicious. I got the Hong Kong Egg Noodle. Meh. Sauce tasted ok but was a nasty snot consistency. I got BBQ pork, suspect it was microwaved. The hubster got Chicken Fried Rice. What appeared before him was more like Uncle Ben's Instant Rice, with microwaved veggie pieces thrown in. Gross. Bland. Boring.   Fun fact. The husband spent the night on the toilet. I think my stomach has waited until morning to get upset about this particular meal. Never again. Screw you Noodles.",

    "text": "Las Vegas - much less the Bellagio - would be the very last place I would think of if I was in the mood for jook. But lo and behold, among the five-dollar-sign eateries in the elaborate casino is a semi-reasonably priced noodle house. By no means is this in the same class as Picasso or Le Cirque. It's a place for the rest of us, the ones who forked over a hundred bucks to see Cher across the street at Caesar's Palace and didn't want to sink the rest of our savings on a meal we were too tired to enjoy anyway.  This being Vegas, it's a lot nicer and contemporary than your standard noodle joint. It has rows of jars filled with all sorts of dried noodles set against a lighted wall - lest you make a mistake that this is not a noodle joint. We were served right away at about 9:30 on a Saturday evening, and the waiter was super-attentive. Jamie and I shared an $8 basket of five Shui Mai...pretty good and in need of the mustard sauce to spice them up (see my photo). Jamie went for the $18 plate of Spicy and Sweet Noodles with Chicken - which impressed us with the heft of the poultry pieces (see my photo).  But on my own, I decided to try their Congee Chicken - a smallish bowl with iddy-biddy chicken bits and scallions (see my photo). Not the best jook I ever had but it was nice balm for my then-sore throat. I thought the price was high at $13 - but it did hit the spot at a time when I least expected to have some comfort porridge. We got out of there for a little over fifty bucks, which does seem ridiculous, but hey, this is Vegas. I should be happy I got away with my shirt intact.  FOOD - 4 stars...jook in the land of over-plenty? who da thunk it? AMBIANCE - 4 stars...such a clean noodle joint SERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and responsive TOTAL - 4 stars...hey, we all can't afford the like of Michael Mina and Todd English",

    "text": "Probably the best Asian food I had in Vegas so far (but it's only day 2), it's very authentic when it comes to the Chinese food. I thought the food was a little bland but I remember that's what older chinese people like. So you may have to add some salt and pepper but I thought it was better since it's healthier.  I was extremely hungry on the casino floor and there wasn't much open, but I remembered my friend telling me that Noodles was pretty good. I came a few hours ago but the wait was 45 minutes. Around 12am, I probably only waited around 20 minutes. Once we sat down, the server came relatively quickly to take our order and our food came soon after. We ordered the kimchi, hot and spicy cucumber, roast duck and roast pork, bokchoy in garlic sauce, and 2 congee with century egg and pork. Everything was very good but like I said earlier, a little bland. Although the pork in the congee was very flavorful. Definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food!   My only complaint would be that it's pretty pricey but then again it's casino food, it's expected. My will probably be going back here since my friends will be back for poker.   Tip: if your friends play in the high stakes room in the back, food is free. I'll be doing that next time :)",

We were sat right away and the waitresss kept out water filled up throughout the whole meal. We started off with the calamari, not the best ever but not the worst either. We then shared the chicken pad Thai and beef chow mein. Pad thai could have been spicer for my liking but the chow mein was good. Overall a good choice for a casual Saturday night meal in Vegas.",

The wings may have had a touch too much salt, but was still very tasty despite that.  We both had noodle dishes and they were very good.  The serving size was also quite big.  It is a little pricey for those options, but given the location it is to be expected.  We would definitely go back if we are staying at the Bellagio",

    "text": "Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #21 - #365  After a long 3 1/2 hour drive from California, checking into the Bellagio, and getting settled in the room, they start craving for Asian food. The first restaurant that comes up in Noodles because it's not too big like the other restaurants and it's tucked away right by the Baccarat Bar and table games.   Every time we wait to be seated, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes but when Chinese customers wait, they are seated right away like they were, V.I.P.'s. Sounds like discrimination to me!  The Contemporary decoration in this restaurant was very relaxing with various jar of ingredients they use for their overpriced food.   Our server was friendly and personable and gave us our drinks right away with some time to order.   We ordered:   *Hot Tea $4.50 -- Jasmine  *CHILEAN SEA BASS $34: Nonya curry sauce, bell peppers, onions (steamed) Homemade garlic ginger sauce, broccoli (steamed or deep fried) Soy sauce, green onions, ginger (steamed)  *BEEF $22 Kung pao sauce, bell peppers, onions, peanuts Broccoli, straw mushrooms, carrots Mongolian style, bell peppers, onions, green onions Black pepper sauce, asparagus Black bean sauce, bell peppers, onions, garlic  *CHINESE BROCCOLI $12.50 Sauteed in garlic or steamed (oyster sauce)  *CANTONESE ROAST DUCK $18.50 Plum sauce  The food in my honest opinion was delicious and I couldn't fault on anything. What bothered me and caused the review to go from 5 stars to 2 stars was the service. It took us a while to get our refills for out water and the food took about 25  - 35 minutes to be served.   Our server kept telling us, \"the food was on it's way,\" my Dad got tired of waiting and went to hit the slots. Around the restaurant, I noticed a lot of Chinese customers were getting their food much faster than us and that made me irritated. I never experienced this level of service.   Nest time, I'll avoid this over priced restaurant and go for the Bellagio Snack bar where I can receive excellent service and cheaper eats.",

So we waited in this massive line which the servers said would take about an hour to maybe two hours long.   While waiting and waiting about an hour and half we got to sit on a table. I knew what I already wanted and what I ordered was edamame for everyone to share and a porridge with century egg in it and a little bit of pork. The edamame had a lot of salt on it and that was kind of a turn off. The porridge was alright but of course I'm not going to say it was amazing.   Overall the food was alright and the 7 people I was with enjoyed it as well. Service wasn't that great though, so don't expect much from the servers. They aren't going to refill anything for you until you wave your hand up and down.",

The spicy cucumber is a very good way to get the palate going...along with some extra large Tsing Tao beer. The bbq meats are as good as I have had in Toronto or New York. Order the snow pea leaves with garlic...awesome. A great place for a lighter meal with very attentive and friendly service. If you eat at PF Changs and that is your idea of good Chinese, then this place will be lost on you and you will probably think it's expensive...it's well done Chinese food by chefs who know how to cook. We had two appetizers, the bbq meat sampler, a veg and some noodles and with tip it was about $125...again, not cheap, but tasty, clean, well prepared food in a comfortable setting.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas on Valentines weekend for a soccer tournament.  We had braced ourselves for mediocre food and inflated prices due to the place and time. On Sunday my son and I walked around to check out the strip and walked through the Bellagio. When he read the menu, his first impulse was \"this is where we're bringing Mom to dinner.\"  We came back around 8pm and had to wait in line for 50 minutes (after reading other reviews, we got off easy). We waited in line with a wonderful older Asian couple from Manitoba in town to watch the Rugby Sevens. This was there 5th time eating there over the last couple of years. Their recommendation, \"order whatever you want, there is nothing bad here.\"  The food was excellent. I loved the sweet and spicy cucumber salad, and the beer was as cold as could be without icing up. The shrimp dumplings were steaming hot and the filling was a savory shrimp mixture that was fantastic.  The XO Crabmeat Vermicelli was delicate and had complex flavors. I was wanting something with more punch to it but I think this was my poor choosing not a shortcoming of the dish. The BBQ pork was so delicious, smoky, sweet and tender. My son had the BBQ pork and roast duck with jasmine rice. I will take him at his word that it was \"really great.\" There was none to try after he annihilated the platter.  It is pricier than you might find elsewhere, but you are in Vegas, so it comes with the zip code. Its the Bellagio so it looks good, the food is awesome, the (mostly) Chinese staff is aloof, but I would certainly go back.",

I knew ordering an app and an entree would be too much food but what is Vegas all about...excess, baby!  I ordered the agedashi to start.  I am not impressed.  The presentation was something I've never seen and didn't really care for.  The tofu was cut in to little squares and deep fried.  So there was a LARGE plate of tofu and the agedashi sauce was served on the side.  No diakon, green onion or much flavor for that matter.  I had to add soy to the sauce to bump up the flavor.  I also ordered the Penang noodles.  Also not a lot of flavor.  The flat noodles were a wonderful texture though.  Thinner than the fresh flat noodles I'm accustomed to.  I ordered them with beef I I will admit that the beef was delicious!  The service was not the best.  I was never asking how my meal was, my iced tea was never refilled and I waited at least 15 minutes after I was finished for my check to arrive.  I finally had to flag my server down and ask for it.

There was a line in front of the restaurant and about 6 parties in front of us, but we decided to wait since no one was particularly hungry. The wait ended up being about 25 minutes. Some were seated sooner but we had a party of five so it took a little longer.  The restaurant has a variety of rice and noodle dishes from different countries, from your Chinese meat over rice (roast duck, char siu, soy sauce chicken) to varieties of fried rice, to udon, pad thai, chow fun, and chow mein.  We decided to eat family style and ordered chow fun (rice noodles with soy sauce, bean sprouts, and BBQ pork), BBQ pork fried rice, chicken pad thai, double happiness (roast duck and soy sauce chicken), and steamed book choi with oyster sauce.  At first I thought we may have ordered too much, but the food was so delicious that we ate everything. That is not to say the portions were too small, just that the food was really good. The duck was crispy and lean. The pad thai was made with flat rice noodles which gave it an interesting twist. The chow fun had big pieces of pork in it. All and all, the family gave it a hearty thumbs up.  Our only regret is that we were there at night and it was too late to try the dim sum.",

I was very disappointed at the fact that I am a NOIR member at the Aria and they gave me troubles when showing them my card. If you are not aware, NOIR membership you receive when you gamble a lot in Vegas and gets you VIP lines, etc.  I had lost my NOIR card so the one I was holding had an expiration date but is still working. What bothered me was that the the lady in the front didn't bother to call to make sure my membership was good in order to seat me. I got very annoyed but, what can you do?

They were all \"good\". My main entree was the steamed Chilean Sea Bass served with steamed rice. Unfortunately, at $35 it was only \"average\". By no means bad, but I've had better at Mitchell's Fish Market Restaurant chain. Overall, all of the dishes needed more seasoning because they tasted somewhat bland for my palate. I also had two tall glasses of their Thai iced tea. I'd highly recommend it.   Service was very fast, professional, and tip worthy. There were a lot of Asians eating there which to me is a very good sign. There was a line snaking outside from the hostess desk out to the casino proper.

I THINK our server tried to talk me out of the Hong Kong noodles. He said he likes it but some people don't like the gravy with the noodles. Ordered it anyway lol I enjoyed it but I can see how it would be weird for someone else.",

It was a dish with rice noodles and a fish ingredient that made it exceptional.  Other than that, the food was similar to any regular Chinese restaurant.  The service was a little on the slow side.  No, I don't think I'd come back here.  Too many other choices that are less expensive.",

    "text": "This is a casual, relaxing spot where you can enjoy some Chinese comfort food. The menu has a good range of options, and the noodles are tasty and satisfying.   The food is admittedly overpriced, especially for a style of cuisine that costs very little to make, but I don't necessarily fault the restaurant for that. You should always expect higher prices when dining on the strip. The bigger problem is that the line to be seated can get pretty long, and they don't take reservations. Sometimes you do get lucky, though. When I went yesterday, I only waited for about 5 minutes.  I would say that this restaurant is comparable to Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesar's. Of the two, Beijing seems to have better food, but I would say that Noodles has the more relaxing atmosphere.   Either restaurant would be a fine choice, but overall, I think I like Beijing Noodle No. 9 a little bit better.",

The portions were tiny and the food wasn't great. It tasted like Americanized-Chinese food. The service wasn't the best either. The waiters had somewhat of a attitude; because my party was big, they decided to be rude.  Now, onto the incident. I had ordered beef chow fun and what do you know? There was a hair chilling between the noodles, YUCK! I knew it wasn't my hair because I'm a woman with long hair. I had complained to the waiter and it took them a good 20 minutes before coming back to me apologizing and offering me another dish for free.  They were kind enough to give me a free dish and I'm sure the hair wasn't purposely placed on my dish. In all honesty, I probably won't be back.",

So this may not be the best place for a vegetarian.  I ordered white rice and enjoyed the sights around me, this restaurant is very well put together and has an upscale yet authentic feel to it making it very enjoyable nonetheless! The staff were very attentive, and they even serve you sides from a cart with little metal containers for each to keep them warm!  It was a very sweet and comfortable experience for my mother's birthday. The tonkotsu was her favorite bowl of the evening, and everything was well organized in means of menu. I can't say I will return for a full meal, but the experience was memorable from my recent trip away from home.",

Sore throat, cough, and congestion, and really just wanted to be back in my room.  We ended up eating at Noodles, and to my absolute joy, they serve Taiwanese beef Noodle soup, the ultimate comfort food to me.  If it's on a menu, no matter what the weather is like or my personal food craving is, I ALWAYS order it.  I happened to be very much in the mood for BNS, and was overjoyed by the meal they brought me. It hit the spot in every way possible that a bowl of noodle soup can when you're in the middle of the desert.  It would get five stars, but my husband wasn't quite as overjoyed with his meal.  It was good, but not awe inspiring the way mine was. We're planning a trip to Vegas soon and I fully intend on going back for another bowl of noodles.  Their name is True to their word, and I look forward to eating there again soon.  As always, I strongly recommend to not get mainstream dishes when you visit authentic-type Asian restaurants.",

The service here is so so since they all don't really speak perfect English except the hostess in the front lol. I mean this place does open for long hours and it is safe, located in the Belagio hotel. Can't really ask for much when you are trying to eat at a place with casinos surrounding.

Since it is located in a casino, the place looks nice and has a decent amount of seating.  Most of the staff speak Mandarin as well.  Menu is pretty vast from dim sum to noodle soups to fried rice to stir fried noodles.  As for us we tried the oxtail soup, shrimp dumplings, and some type of stir fried noodles.  Again, I would say the food is good to above average.  So overall we were pleased with the food.    Best draw about this place is location, open late, and convenience.  One thing you probably won't like about this place is the price.  Again everything on the strip is expensive so not sure why people are complaining about that and lowering stars for that.  If you want better Chinese food go to chinatown located several miles away.    If your tired of the usual buffets and want asian inspired dishes give this place a shot.",

I called the # listed on the Yelp listing which took me to Bellagio reservations. They then transferred me to Noodles and they said just come by (even though I called to make a reservation bc we had a party of 5 and didn't want to stand in line too long). We get to Noodles and maybe there was an influx of people who suddenly craved the hodgepodge of Asian selections, but there was a long line. Sad face. Understandable thought because they tried to move the line as fast as they could.  Unfortunately the service was mediocre and somewhat rude. We did not get water or tea until close to 15 minutes AFTER the server took our order. We then had to ask for the condiments that usually accompany our dishes (sriracha and hoisin for the pho and red vinegar for the wonton noodle soup).   I can't speak for the other dishes but my wonton noodle soup was overcooked and flavorless.   Also, I understand this is a casino food outlet but I would have expected better service and a little more than tasteless soup.",

I spotted the hostess and aked her if we could sit down and she said 20 minute wait. This must be their strategy to hold people in line so others think they are busy. I found this to be very frustrating. We waited anyway and finally seated after waiting 20 minutes. We ordered and were served food in 5 minutes! The waiter was the best thing about the whole experience. Food was average with prices obviously way higher than average.  We ordered the pot stickers pan fried which were bland as bland can be. I ordered spicy beef nodles which were decent but nothing to write home about. My wife ordered the Szechuan minced pork which was also ok. All in all food was ok but the whole waiting before was ridiculous also the complete lack of any form of communication with the customers by the hostess was RUDE!",

Overall, not worth it, not even for the $30.88 price tag.  I had high hopes but was crazy disappointed. At least the service was good and the decor is cute.",

They eventually moved us but they seemed to think we were unreasonable.  The dim sum itself was good. Not as good as Lucky Dragon was and double the price with less of a variety.  The vegetable dumplings were really good and the stuffed mushrooms.  The roast duck was very good. Flavorful and tender and bonus points for taking it off the bone.  That was the only item we ordered off the menu.  We wanted to try the spicy cucumbers and a soup but after the experience we had trying to be seated we decided against it.  Of we ever come back maybe we will try that and skip the dim sum",

I feel like the beef noodle soup was a little bland. It was pretty average. The seafood noodle soup was saltier than the beef noodle, and it was okay.  The shrimp tempura were pretty good.   The mango pudding was probably the best. It wasn't over sweetened and it literally melts in your mouth.   Total came out to be $60.  On another note, I can't say I'm a fan of their bowls / spoons. The bowl is pretty steep, making it hard to scoop any soup. Also, the spoon being really thick doesn't help with that. It makes it difficult to enjoy the soup and noodles together in a spoon.",

It is the Bellagio, but c'mon people!  3 stars for the food - noodles are pretty plain so you need to use those free (!) condiments on the table to season them yourself (thai shrimp noodles, wonton noodles, abalone congee, gyoza) and 1 star for the priciness factor.",

However, even if there is a line, I find that it moves pretty fast, so at least in my book, that makes it a line worth waiting in.  Especially for the food at the other end!  REALLY cool atmosphere, lined floor to ceiling with glass jars of noodles of all different sizes, shapes, and colors.  My only complaints are that it can get a bit loud, and that the seats at the normal tables feel a bit low -- definitely get a booth if you can.  My recommendation is the Yellow Indian Noodles. I know that when you're in Las Vegas you feel obligated to drink alcohol, but if you're at Noodles take a break from the booze and order the fresh soy milk.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Even my friends who don't like soy milk like this stuff.  But if you absolutely won't try it, get the Thai tea instead.  It's potent.  Whatever you do, DO NOT PASS on getting Brazillian Papaya with for dessert.  It is literally a party in your mouth.",

The agadashi tofu was flavorless.    We also tried their Thai iced tea, which was really good.   Service was really slow and crappy.

They have the best tasting noodle dishes around!  We always try to go on a Fri, Sat or Sun because that's when they have the dim sums.  We always order the bbq pork noodle soup with egg noodles.  The soup tastes so delicious.  It's good everytime!  Then we order the spring rolls, the crab and spinach dumplings,the fried shrimp and the shou mai (steamed pork & shrimp dumplings).  The egg custard is great too!  I love the Thai iced tea!    We have tried other noodle shops around the other hotels but nothing can beat our taste buds for Noodles.

My friends and I discovered the simple logic of Noodles' pricing. Take the price you would pay at any regular Asian restaurant not located in the Bellagio and multiply it by 2. We found this out the hard way when we all decided to get a bowl of white rice for each of us and saw that once we got the bowl it was $4 per bowl and that my glass of cranberry juice was $4.50. I mean I don't expect anything else since it is in the Bellagio but just giving you all a heads up.  The food I would give it a 3.5-4 (Crab vermicelli is delishhhh) but the reason I gave a 2 is because of the service. Unless they are trying to give you a really authentic experience of an Asian restaurant, which includes horrible service, then I get it. Other than that, there should be no reason why the service in such a high class place such as the Bellagio should be so bad! They seriously need some extra hospitality training. We would call our waitress to get us another glass of water for the billionth time and she would raise her finger up at us as if to hush us and rush off. Granted she did give us our water eventually, but every time we asked for something it was as if every waiter and waitress were walking by so fast to avoid being called on by anyone or it would be given reluctantly. Come on now, if I'm paying $4 for a tiny bowl of white rice I better be getting some tip top service!",

Rows and rows of dried noodles were on display on the shelves.  Even with my parents paying our tab, our hands were tied from being thrifty folks, so we tried finding some of the cheaper things on the menu. This meant things like the Signature Premiere Rice..  ...which was bland fried rice despite the bits of pineapples and raisins they stuck in there.  The Signature Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles with Barbeque Pork was surprisingly good, although the dish was a bit heavy on the onions. The noodles were thick and tasty.  And the Yaki Udon with Chicken was just average, on the salty side, and heavy on the bell peppers, although I liked the texture of the noodles themselves.  The chicken slices were quite large in this dish.  These three dishes cost about 50 bucks and barely fed three adults and two young kids. When you're stuck in a Vegas casino and you've got few options, a place like Noodles is a decent place to get overpriced food. Otherwise, get in a car or taxi and head over to Vegas Chinatown for better Asian food.  Full review and photos are on my blog.",

    "text": "Excellent after show dinner experience.  We went here after seeing a show at New York New York hotel. Since we met while both stationed in Korea, we decided to have an Asian dinner.  We waited a little bit at the door which was ok. For a Sunday night, it was still crowded and busy. As soon as a couple left, another was been seated.  Instead of the traditional kimchi, we had hot and spicy cucumber, cucumber and kim salad, udon soup, and kung pao shrimp with warm saki and a Coke for me. Everything was delicious. I enjoyed the cucumber dishes. Very yummy! The prawns for the kung pao shrimp cooked to perfection with a wonderful sauce. The flavor of the red bell pepper complimented the sauce and shrimp. The portion sizes were exactly right for two.  The only thing I can think of as a negative was that the refills for the Coke were not free.  An EXCELLENT dinner experience none the less. Recommend it to everyone who like asian or want to try asian dishes.",

Not exactly the best Chinese food in town but if you're hungry for Chinese and the buffet line is longer than the wall of China, then give it this joint a try.  Very good Chinese broccoli, crunchy and juicy. The Sweet Pork was a bit dry and so were the BBQ pork buns.  The service was below average for being part of the Bellagio but meh... just been here twice and it hits the spot for the price you pay.",

We ordered the chicken chow mein and pork dish, not realizing that the pork dish was literally just a plate of pork. The noodles were very, very salty, and the pork was just ok. Perhaps we would have been better off just ordering some starters to share, based on other reviews, but I don't think we'll be returning with so many other options to eat in Vegas.",

We go out to eat a lot and have a solid understanding of good service, this was awful.  Angry, frustrated staff. No smile, barely a hello. When asked for recommendations on the menu, she pointed to one section of the menu and said this is all good.   We ordered:  Hong Kong Noodles: Came out as crispy noodles with shrimp, fat dripping in oil, just lard, yuck. XO Green Beans: We expected spicy green beans and these were a big disappointment due to lack of any flavor or any spices. Noodle Soup: Name started with an L (cant remember full name) was the only semi-flavorful item. It was in coconut milk with noodles and chicken. Decent, and actually tasty. The chicken however did not look like real chicken, must be imitation. Beef with Asparagus: Not good, not spicy, also greasy and definitely not worth $21.  We sent the Hong Kong Noodles back, we couldn't send back everything obviously, that would be too much. They still tried to slip us the check with the noodles though and when we objected she said we'd have to talk to the manager (keep in mind, this restaurant is in BELLAGIO), after a stare down to the manager they adjusted the bill.  We live in San Francisco and are used to good quality Chinese food and excellent service. We have no qualms to pay good money for good service and good food. However, this place was a huge disappointment.  Would never recommend and will never come back.",

I recommend the beef rice noodles (basically beef chow fun). The noodles had a great silky, tender texture, and the beef was extremely tender. This dish was nicely seasoned without being too salty. For dim sum, I highly recommend the shanghai dumplings, the chive dumplings, the pan-fried shrimp and pork dumplings, the pork bun, and their specialty custard bun which must be ordered in advance. Those custard buns were so fluffy and the custard was creamy yumminess. We ended up ordering a bottle of champagne to accompany our meal and it really enhanced the meal! This place definitely has Vegas Strip prices (not to mention that it's in the Bellagio) but the food was really good so I didn't mind the higher bill at the end of the meal.",

My shrimp dumpling soup was pretty good, with a fishiness in the broth that didn't wrankle my nose, which can be a hard feat with a diner who didn't eat much fish growing up. But you're paying a lot of money for a small bowl of noodles. The ambiance, like the rest of Vegas, covers up structural problems with a dazzling and dizzying array of exotic looking noodles in jars against the wall, almost as if a noodle crazed mad scientist had taken up residence in the restaurant. But the food was on the meager side, and expensive, evn given the quality. And we found the service to be wanting. I think they were short a waiter, but we had to call one over after waiting an unusual amount of time for someone to take a drink order. The food also took a long time, even though we arrived well after the typical dinner hour. Also, I wouldn't come here if a member of your party is a frequent visitor to bathrooms and has trouble walking. The bathrooms are on the other side of the casinos (of course), so you'll be trekking through slot machines and hordes of well dressed career professionals to get to the facilities. Unfortunately, while Vegas may have good food here and there, often there isn't a lot of choice once you're anchored in a casino. Each one has their pride and joy restaurants. For what it's worth, I'd either skip the noodle section of the menu here and hope for something better in, say, the Mappo dofu, or try the Cantonese restraurant across the way which may or may not be a better choice.",

Food here is definitely overpriced, as I learned many restaurants in the nice casinos are, but we were comped so I can't complain about price.

Usually, the rice is simmered in broth, but the rice was pretty dry - chicken, too.  We also got the Beef Chow fun, which wasn't bad but not excellent either.  The best part of my meal was the Iced Coffee (which I think they charge $6 for).  Everyone also liked the Fried Shrimp Balls, which came on a dim sum cart.  I was excited to see Soupy Dumplings on the cart, but alas, they were only moist and not very soupy at all.  Most items were mediocre and I most likely will not eating here again.",

Steve Wynn built a fast in-n-out Asian joint (and spared no expense, that's real gold in the floors) that serves dishes from most every major culture (Thai, Various Chinese, Malaysia, Singapore, et al) that the high roller players next door in Baccarat could get in and out quickly with a great meal and get back to the tables.  Its a little hidden (off the main floor) and staffed to accommodate and pamper the high rollers.  The secret has been out for years and the place is generally packed, so plan ahead and go off hours.  A little insider secret, on busy nights you can order from Noodles from Room Service.  The food is amazing, take your pick.  A few favorites: Spicy Thai Noodle Soup, BBQ Pork, Roast Duck, Shu Mai, Satay, Pad Thai Noodle, Ox Tail Soup, you really can't miss here.  Dim Sum on the weekends is always a good choice.  How do you know a good Asian place, look around and see who is eating there - its generally packed with well dressed Asian shopping and gaming tourists and the Bellagio is doing everything possible to make them happy.  Not stereotypical, the same holds True with looking for local pick-up trucks at a diner.  The pricing is moderate for Vegas, not cheap but a good value.   In Vegas, you have to work the system and this is a great example.    High roller quality available to anyone willing to find Noodles and enjoy.",

My coworker and I ordered:  Sesame chicken: looked like thin strips of plastic dipped in starchy sweet and sour sauce. Funny cause it tasted like it too. Only thing sesame about it were the sprinkles on top.  XO Green beans: I asked the waiter what XO was (HEY, JUST CAUSE IM ASIAN DOESNT MEAN I AUTOMATICALLY KNOW ALL THE SAUCES GEEZ) and he said I shouldn't be worried because it's very tasty and not too spicy. I wasted my time asking cause I didn't even taste any sauce. It was so bland. The string beans must have been grown in a neighborhood farm (note this is Vegas) cause they were sooooo small and skinnnnnnnny. I felt so bad for those guys I almost wanted to just drench them in my water. Well, atleast it had a nice crunchy texture.  Laksa curry: Our other coworker said it was difficult to eat bc of a strange fishy taste although it was a chicken curry soup...*cringe*  Beef noodle soup was the best bowl of the table so we just stared at her as we crunched or sipped politely on.  A Chinese pair next in line were debating so I did them a civil service and frantically shook my head as I pointed to my dish. I never saw them get seated.",

    "text": "Great little chinese restaurant located in the heart of the Bellagio...a little misplaced you might think, but you have no idea how quaint and comforting a nice hot bowl of congee is the \"morning\" (I believe it was 3pm) after a night of heavy drinking. I got the \"pi dan so rou zou\", or translated into English, \"Thousand year old egg and salted pork congee\". I have been told in the past (after other nights of heavy drinking) that the black gelatinous egg has the uncanny ability to suck toxins out of the body, in my case much of this was needed and boy did it work. Even after the ridiculous amount of booze that was consumed the congee sat great in the tummy, and after a short nap I was back to...well probably only 80%, but was as much as I could probably ask for.  My cousin ordered, \"niu rou mien\", or Beef noodle soup, a classic Taiwanese dish that looked amazing. The beef looked relatively lean, served with thick noodles.  Prices here, and well quite frankly everywhere in Vegas, are a bit expensive, but comparatively was actually quite a good deal. I would definitely go back to this place in any state, and look forward to trying some new dishes.",

Everything I have tried to date has been ultra-whitewashed and overly soy-sauced out.  This all recently changed when we discovered Noodles in the Bellagio.  This place has got a vast menu.  The Laksa, Roti Prata and curry dishes we sampled were all authentic and delish.  Coupled with pleasant, hip decor and accommodating hours (open till 2 a.m.)...We actually really enjoyed Noodles.  Probably the only gripe is that the place is atypically pricey for Asian food...but hey it's the Bellagio and nothing is cheap there.  Next time we need an Asian fix when we are in Vegas, we would definitely check out Noodles again.",

I ordered a BBQ Pork Wonton Hor Fun noodle soup but they gave me egg noodles by accident. I told them and they came back with an extra heaping of BBQ Pork. Grateful and delighted. I also like that the soup is very hot. Pricey but what can you expect when you're on the strip in Vegas?",

All menu items are A la carte, with appetizers ranging from $6.00 - $13.00, and main course, $12.00 - $30.00.  We came to this restaurant for Dim Sum on a Saturday morning(around 11am), and got seated immediately. We had about 10 different items, and everything we had was delicious. Although the price is more than double what I usually pay at a dim sum restaurant back home, but the varieties and quality of the food, with the ambiance and service is definitely worth the $$.   They only serve Dim Sum Friday - Sunday 11:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. The line can get pretty long, so get there early if you can.",

Okay, sometimes a slice of pizza does the trick, and yeah, so might a bowl of clam chowder, but think about it,  Chinese food is flavorful, usually comes with fresh vegetables and is served hot.  So when we're at the Bellagio, Noodles is our go to restaurant.  (I guess we're often hungry and drunk when we're there.}  Yes, it's pricey, but it's still cheaper than any of the other restaurants in the hotel unless you're having a burger or a pastry.  Many people seem to know this because the line can stretch pretty far out the door. We try to eat earlier rather than later because it seems like the line doesn't diminish after a certain hour.  Turnover is fairly quick, though.  Okay, so you order a bowl of won ton and noodle soup because the rum and cokes you're drinking have been eating away your stomach lining.  The warm broth comforts you, the wonton, noodles and vegetables nourish and revitalize you.  Then you look at the bill and realize the food is twice as expensive as what you would pay at home,,,,,,,Vegas.........",

It's not cheap - I think my bowl of Vietnamese Seafood Pho was about $18 - but it was soothing, aromatic (lots of cilantro, just the way I like it), and delicious (and huge, with large chunks of fresh seafood).  It was actually one of the best bowls of pho I've had (mind you I live in NYC, which is notoriously lacking in solid Vietnamese cuisine, but still).  The shrimp and pork shumai ($9) were gorgeously plump and tasty - an excellent way to start the meal.  And the Fresh Young Coconut ($8) was a terrific way to end.  Service was a little slow, and my waitress wouldn't serve me congee because she didn't think I would like it (I beg to differ, but no sense arguing with the person in control of preventing you from passing out from hunger).  The menu is vast, not for the indecisive, and a little schizophrenic, drawing inspiration not from one country, but four (Thailand, Japan, China, Japan).  Simply decorated, it is not flashy or fancy.  We were there early afternoon, and there seemed to be more executives on their lunch break than hotel guests (a good sign?  I think so).  Overall, a solid choice with great food.  It lacks the razzmatazz that personifies so much of Vegas, but offers a nice, simple hunger solution following several days (and nights) of gluttony.",

The dish arrived within 15 minutes. With just the right touch of spice to get me eating more.

We waited in line for about 15 minutes and we were promptly seated.  At first, the lady at the restaurant said it would be for 1/2 hour!  So that was quick!    We ordered the following dishes since we are originally Singaporean: - RotI Prata - Good and flaky roti prata where you dip it in the a small dish of curry.  The curry has authentic taste and the chef uses curry leaves to enhance the flavor of the curry.  There could be a little more curry so that I could sop up my roti prata. - Laksa - Delicious and very close to the authentic Singapore Laksa Lemak!  That coconut broth reminds me of home right away! - Hainanese Chicken Rice - So-so.  I've had better.  The chicken has the correct Hainanese taste and so does the rice but I think the chicken could be more moist.  Also, the chili sauce that comes with the platter is not the correct Hainanese chili.  The ginger sauce is ok. - Penang Char Kway Teow with Shrimp - it's just ok for me.  Not enough sweet black sauce.  So overall, I'd come back to have the Laksa for sure.",

    "text": "I will not ever recommend this place to any friends.  Maybe a few enemies.  I'm not sure how anyone can rate this place higher than 3 stars.  I don't care if the place is in the Bellagio, the quality of the food and service are not at the level of the prices.  None of the food we had was any where near exceptional.   Pho for $17 is triple of what you should pay.  There wasn't anything fantastic about it, the same bowl that I could get in a neighborhood Pho shop.  Plus we had to ask for sriracha and hoisin sauce.  The Singapore noodle dish really lacked curry flavor.  In the neighborhood restaurant I visit at home is packed with flavor and is $8 less.  Oh, I forgot I'm in the Bellagio.  Service was fair, but after our food arrived, there was almost no attention given.  Here's where the meal went really wrong.  One of the wait staff began clearing our table.  In her desire to get as many dishes off of our table as possible, she had way too many dishes in her hands.  She dropped one of the dishes on the floor and broke, with one of the pieces hitting me in the leg.  At first I thought, oh it hit me on the leg, no problem.  A few minutes later I felt liquid running down my leg, so I looked down and saw blood.  I used my napkin to wipe it off and then called the waitress that dropped the plate.  She looked at it and was going to wipe it with a towel that she was using to wipe the tables with.  I pulled my foot back and asked that she bring me a clean cloth and bandages.  She said she would tell the manager.  We waited for about 5 minutes and no manager came.  We found the manager ourselves and let her know what happened.  She said no one told her about the incident.  She had security come talk to us to make sure I didn't need paramedics. I told him I wanted to report this as an incident to make sure management had a record of it.  I never asked for anything other than to have an incident report made.  He told me that he would talk to the manager and have her adjust our bill.  What is really odd is most restaurants, when a customer is injured by the staff with blood, they will comp the entire bill.  She only took off half the amount and wasn't really apologetic.  Her attitude was more like I was an inconveniencing her and I should have moved my leg to avoid the dropping dish.  In summary, this place is way over price for mediocre food.  You can't blame the wait staff for poor service since they perform at the highest level of their manager.  And her low quality of service sets the bar really low for her team.  Oh yeah for the reviewers that said it had a great Asian ambiance, the decor reminded me of a casino cafe.  The only thing that made it seem like an Asian restaurant is the art work on the walls and the menu.  Stay away from this place!  This shows that they really have no care for the customer.",

She explained all the food and what to expect from each dish. She was super quick and got our food out fast. The food however was disappointing. The food was very very bland. I really expected more from the Bellagio. I will not be back and with so many different options in Vegas I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. For the price point you can much better quality food elsewhere.",

    "text": "My first Vegas review! I have to admit that it's difficult to rate your dining experience in a casino. The hustle and bustle and eclectic crowd mix can vary widely and greatly affect the meal and ambiance. Very little went into the research and selection of this quick lunch grab, however the place offered some warm tea and hot dumpling noodle soup; as such, I was in!  The food was probably a 4 or 5 on its own merit. Had a very authentic feel and flavor. Really good noodles and dumplings! The menu seemed to have a South East Asian influence and that suits my tastes well. Also their tea was unexpectedly delicious, unfortunately I didn't ask about it's specifics (apologies!); definitely have some if you partake in a meal here.   The setting was very bright and felt well suited for a business meal, which was fine for me as I'm in town on business; however it does give a bit of an impersonal vibe and the proximity of tables around you only compounds that. The service is succinct but rushed due, I suspect, to the volume of business running through the casino.   Overall solid 3 stars, ideally I'd like to come back to solidify my evaluation but unlikely to be able to return on this trip. Go for the food, but don't plan to having your signature meal in Vegas here; there are likely more fantastical experiences to be had around the city.",

This trip we had the sweet and spicy noodles with shrimp and oxtail soup, both of which are among the best we have ever had. My husband is a lover of oxtail soup, and Noodles is one of his most favorite places to get it. The broth is rich and tastes like it has been brewing for days. The meat is so tender and has an almost sweet quality to it. Absolutely delicious. The Sweet and Spicy Noodles are also a favorite of ours. I first ordered it a few years ago. I love 'sweet and sour' dishes, but hubby is not a fan. However, he tried one bite of my dish and it has been his 'go-to' ever since! The difference is that their dish isn't sweet and sour, but sweet and spicy. The mix of flavors are really amazing. The portion is generous enough to share, especially for a lunch where you don't want to end up over-eating. The service is usually good, though not particularly chatty or friendly, which is fine. We have also had their dim sum in the past and have really enjoyed that as well. We have dined in, we have ordered take out to take back to our room, and we have always enjoyed our meals from Noodles!",

    "text": "Having been in the US for 6 years and constantly searching, i've come to accept that the best chinese food is still in Hong Kong. There is however a sweet consolation---264 miles away from my area,there is Noodles. Surprisingly, I would find my favorite chinese food place inside a vegas hotel. But it's True, the exceptional taste of the food here brought back memories of my Hong Kong love affair with congee, dimsum, peking duck and noodles. Unlike other places I tried, their roasted duck is tasty yet not as greasy (you can even order it de-boned which makes for an even more enjoyable pigout). Their dimsum is topnotch. Basic selections like har gao, siu maai, bau and ma chang taste exceptional. My most favorite of all though is their seafood congee. Not a lot of chinese restarants serve this well, if at all, but in Noodles, they have it great. It has savory stuff like squid, scallops, mushroom, bokchoy, fish fillets in a tasty base (not watered down or too textured).I do wish they'd expand the dismsum menu and serve woo kok (mashed taro with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp, pork), and bring back the seasoned jellyfish. Other than that, I have no complaints. If you do love chinese food, and you know chinese food by heart, this place won't disappoint. And for those of you who prefer other asian cuisine, like korean, japanese, vietnamese or thai, Noodles also has tasty selections to satisfy your cravings (eg. pad thai, pho, kimchi, udon, and other favorites). Not the cheapest place, but definitely worth it. Did I mention the ambiance? It's a casual, comfortable place with minimalist beautiful decor by Tony Chi. This is a must for those who love asian food and a good time.",

We weren't too hungry so we only got one appetizer, the Satay, and one entree, the Pad Thai.  The dishes were mediocre tasting and somewhat expensive - oh well, it's Vegas right?  Little did I know that as we stepped out and began walking to Planet Hollywood, I would start to feel a little uneasy in the stomach.  I quickly looked for a restroom and dashed in as I set my eyes on one (I will leave the rest to your imagination- what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas... hehe).  Before this unexpected turn of events, I thought Noodles was average at worst, but after wards, I said to myself  \"I will never set my butt in there ever again\".  After the mistake of eating there, I realized that, indeed, the best bet in Vegas is the buffet.  Even though after eating at most buffets, my stomach lining always feels like it is on the verge of tearing, the pain is worth it since it still better than Noodles.",

To be brief, was a little disappointed, the sui gow (pan fried dumplings) was just OK. This is also the second place I've encountered in my travels where they add ground shrimp to their pork Shui mai, usually there might just be a piece of shrimp on top of the pork. The ground shrimp detracts from the pork flavor. This is something I'm not used to. There was no Ha Gow on the menu (straight shrimp dumpling), again dissappointed. The pan fried noodles with barbecue pork was well made, very crispy, as it should be, but alas it was  flavorless (sauce was bland). The barbecue pork was passable. I guess alot has to do with what ingredients you can get in Vegas. Overall will satisfy your craving, but can't hold up to Vancouver, Ottawa and of course New York dim sum outside of Hong Kong. I was impressed they had congee, but didn't try it. My mom makes the best.",

We came for lunch because deb wanted some of her people's food. We ordered the beef stew noodle, green bean in XO sauce and Hainan chicken. Also we got two orders of dim sum, egg custard and a pork/shrimp dumpling. It is True this place is way high priced compared to our area ($18 dish here would be about $5-6) but it is Vegas and we ARE in the Bellagio so go with it and just enjoy. The server spoke Chinese and she asked if we wanted the food \"Asian\" style...bone in the chicken and tendon in the soup, I guess they actually take the time to use it for flavor but then remove it for the majority of the folks who come here, I mean didn't you all know white people don't like bones....lol....So the best part of the experience was watching people order the weirdest stuff and just thinking no wonder you don't like the food you are ordering stuff from various countries and don't even know it. One table had edemame with pad thai noodles, another table got the typical \"orange\" fish and beef with broccoli, and a third had some strange noodle thing, why are white people so funny?....the point is this place actually has authentic food just a bit high in price but the flavors were all great, I will be back.",

It's a really busy restaurant but it's not huge so the serving staff will help each other out if you need something. What won this place over for me was the dessert. It was awesome to find an authentic Asian dessert right on the strip. Maybe I was just in the mood for it but the mango sticky rice dessert was delicious! They score half of a mango, just like my mom did for me when I was a kid. I don't know where they could possibly get such sweet fruit on the strip but I was scraping the peel with my lower teeth after I ate all the squares. At the time I went, everyone else was dressed in business attire so I'm sure it's perfect for people who work in the area. I would still feel comfortable taking a family here though.

We ordered the chicken satay, roti prata, noodles with XO sauce and pad thai.  The best dish was the chicken satay.  The noodles with XO sauce had no flavor - in my opinion. The pad thai and roti prata were okay.  Service was okay.  Would come here again since it's convenient and quick for Asian food.",

It was almost as good as the ones in Taiwan, but I think a little more spice would enhance the soup more. The noodle was slightly too well done. Surprisly, Noodles makes the best shrimp dumpling (dim sum) that I have ever had.   Great food, but I probably would not come back because this is an over priced Asian restaurant.",

Whatever the reason, I find this place to be pretty good overall.  It comes off a little classy while still being casual enough for it not to come off stuffy.  You may wait a bit to be seated at dinner times; but otherwise, the service as a whole I have found to be efficient enough.  The fried pot stickers are full of pork and de-lish.  This most recent visit I had the shrimp chow mein.  It too was good as well though maybe a little greasy.  The food in general is a little pricey but let's face it, you are in Vegas; and you're eating at a restaurant nestled inside of Bellagio.  Cheap is not what you should be expecting or looking for here.  With that said, it's not over the top or out of line with anything else similar here.  Noodles is another option to consider when you're in Vegas looking for some good Chinese.",

The dish comes with a serving of duck marinated in plum sauce, a bowl of white rice, and a side of Chinese brocolli. You can request the duck to be boned or boneless. I ordered it to be boneless, and it tasted great. I ordered the Bok Choy sauteed with garlic, and it was one of the best bok choy dishes I ever had. I also ordered their pot stickers, and I loved them. I personally prefer to dip them in soy sauce. I also order a century egg on the side.

The food here is slightly better than OK but I suppose it's great if you're from a state where Chinese food sucks.  Being in Vegas, I would expect the Bellagio to find better Chinese chefs.  Alright, here's what I think of the food.  I had the cantonese egg noodles.  Noodles were crispy and appropriately drenched in sauce/oil... Just the way I like it.  The portion was a good size.  However, the dish lacked that \"wow\" that I often get when I get really awesome cantonese fried noodles.  The clear noodle soup with poached chicken actually looked bland as hell but ended up tasting pretty good.  The Kung Pao Chicken was OK - nothing special.    This place used to be a lot better when the Bellagio first opened.  Again, not bad if you're roaming around the Bellagio hungering for chinese food, noodles, a bit cheaper.  But it's not a destination restaurant by any stretch of the imagination.",

Neither were pleased with their dishes, and wished us \"luck.\"   We ordered pot stickers to start, and then a simple sesame chicken, BBQ pork flat noodles and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. And then the wait began. After 35 minutes, the pot stickers came out. Then no more than 5 minutes later, the rest of the meal was brought to the table.   The pot stickers were okay, but nothing spectacular. Sesame chicken was average. Noodle texture was good, but no flavor whatsoever. Bummer. $75 for a ho-hum dinner.

We came in it took them about 5-10min for them to sit us at a table not very long we didn't really care we just wanted some food. While we waited we looked at the menu so we knew exactly what we wanted  My boyfriend and I ordered 3 things shumai, fried rice and a udon seafood soup. The pork and shrimp shumai comes with 5 pieces I would highly recommend very good. We also got the regular fried rice with chicken, it was good but not the best I've tasted. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars Is because I found a piece of hair in my fried rice which was really gross. People in the kitchen just needa be a little more careful. Being the type of person I am I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. I let my waitress know she was very nice about it apologized and said she would let the manager know. The manager then came over to us and apologized as well asked us if we wanted another new fried rice made me and my boyfriend declined the offer as we were waiting for another dish she gladly said she was going to take off the fried rice for us. We also got a seafood noodle soup it had huge pieces of shrimp squid and seabass (which was delicious) the broth was a little plain but it's ok just added some shoyu in there and you are set.   We then got our check and she had taken off our shumai and the fried rice. Very sweet of her we really didnt ask that much. If you are looking for some good Asian food more of a Chinese cuisine style this place is a must check out",

Little did we know that we'd end up doing both heading over to Noodles.  We had a rather large party (around 10), which definitely is not the size you want for this place (I'd say 6 or so max).  Although we reached the front of the line quickly, we still ended up waiting about half an hour to actually be seated.  It then took a long time for them to take our order.  And longer still for us to even get our waters.  All in all, it just took them a long time to get anything to us.  When it did come, they handed it to the wrong people.  It's kind of a small deal, but c'mon...even Denny's can get that right.  The calamari appetizer was probably the best thing I tried here.  My pho was good, but not exceptional, especially given the exceptional price I was charged for it.  The decor has this great golden feel to it and it has just the right lighting.  Too bad the lackluster service and food drag down the experience.",

Watermelon juice hits the spot if you're dehydrated from your time on the strip. Prices are up there, like anything else at Vegas, and especially the Bellagio, but the food is great. Servings are plentiful too so bring a bag for leftovers, or go in hungry. The crab meat vermicelli was exactly what I needed and wasn't too heavy like I've come to expect from most restaurants. I'm also intrigued by other reviewers' remarking on the restaurant's authenticity. I'm excited to try more the next time I'm at the Bellagio.",

This dish was pretty decent, the noodles were good it's blended with a sweet sauce, i'm not too sure about the spicy part? maybe it wasn't spicy enough for me but hey I've wiped out my plate. Along with my order we got a bottle of Sapporo beer which was ok it was kinda on the bitter side and it didn't accommodate it with my noodles thats for sure.  We got friendly service here and we didn't have to wait for our seats, well duh it was like 11:47pm that night. You will see jars and jars of uncooked noodles on display. Hmmmm....I wonder if they use those to create their own noodles?",

We started off with a mojito which was the best I've ever tasted. The items on the menu are pretty expensive, however they had a $30 combo in which there was a veg miso soup with tofu, spring rolls and the main entree which was a spicy & sweet noodle was out of the world. The combo was pretty filling and this place is totally worth it. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'd definitely come here!!",

No complaints there. The thing I do have to say is that the soup itself was bland. The broth. Not at all flavorful. I had the dumpling soup and my bf had the Thai soup. We were a little shocked at the lack of flavor. Now I do have to say, the actual dumplings were good.  This place is overpriced for what they offer. We were rushed around 1:30am because I believe they close at 1:45am. It's not worth coming here-you can get better eats elsewhere.",

My cousins and I only came to this spot because we were meeting up all the oldies in our family who decided to try this place out of convenience & of course they probably didn't read any reviews or was not recommended to try it either.   CONS: - everything I tried was nasty!  - even the presentation of the food was ugly ESPECIALLY for a place that is $$  - the food is made for people who don't like flavor OR who don't know what the food is SUPPOSED to taste like. My bf ordered the shrimp won ton soup and it literally tasted like water. I ordered the roti which usually gets me excited because not a lot of places serve it but the curry it came with was NASTY & trust I've had Malaysian curry before. My cousin ordered the chicken curry rice dish and even that was nasty. I ordered the coconut curry noodle soup that I've ordered at other places before and again NASTY! I recommend asking for the shrimp paste on the side, just the smell of it ruined it for me. They put way too much of it in my soup it didn't even taste like curry anymore. The pad thai was made with the wide rice noodles and NO flavor. The sesame chicken (I think) reminded me of when my dad tried to make my sister & I sweet and sour chicken with ketchup from some cookbook he had YEARS ago!  - this spot is a perfect example of why Asian fusions are BAD!  - the service was HORRIBLE it took forever to get our food, forever to get the check, forever to get our money/cards back... & everything else UGH!   PROS:  - the only thing that came out decent looking was the duck rice plate my cousin ordered & he said it wasn't bad   I would NOT recommend this spot to anyone and I am definitely NOT coming back! Sooooo mad I wasted my money here!",

    "text": "Whenever my friends and I go to Vegas, invariably someone will want to eat Asian style noodles and/or dim sum, so we end up at Noodles in the Bellagio since it's close to where we are. The food here is pretty authentic, but super overpriced, with small portions. There is almost always a short wait to be seated, but they take your order pretty quickly once you're at a table. I've been here a few times, but this is the first time I'm finally writing a review. I've tried:  -Cantonese Dumpling Noodle (Shrimp Dumplings w/Bamboo Shoots, Mushrooms, in Rich Broth, $15.50): Definitely not worth the price since this is typically a bland dish. The dumplings are good but you only get like, three. -Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (Beef Brisket, Tendons-Spiced Herb Broth, $18.75): Really flavorful actually, and they give you a generous amount of beef stew. You can also request for no tendons if you prefer. -Laksa Curry Noodle (Chicken, Fish Cake, Bean Sprouts, Dried Shrimp Paste, Egg, in Rich Coconut Curry Broth, $17): Yum- this is one of our go to dishes. The broth is super flavorful, with the perfect amount of coconut milk in it, and the noodles and other ingredients work very well together. It has a decent amount of spice, so don't get this if you hate spicy food. Otherwise, a must order! -XO Crabmeat Vermicelli (Lump Crab, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Cabbage, XO Sauce, $23.75): Despite the hefty price tag, they do give you a decent amount of crab, and this dish is actually pretty big although it doesn't look that way when it first comes out. It was good, but not so great I would order it again for the price. -Scallop Dumpling & Almond Shrimp Dumpling  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noodles-las-vegas-2?select=kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg#kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nood...</a>): Both were not very good. The scallop was on the gross side since there was barely any scallop and instead a lot of fillers like water chestnut. The Almond Shrimp was bland, but at least there was a good amount of shrimp. I wouldn't order either again though.  I've tried a couple of their other dim sum items like Har Gow and Shiu Mai, and they were good, but if you really want dim sum, you might as well take a cab to the Chinatown area and get a full dim sum meal there. The cost will probably work out to be the same, or cheaper depending on how big your group is. Although the food here is pretty good, the prices are so expensive it makes me cringe as a cheap Asian person! With that being said, I'll probably still be dragged here again on my next trip and just order the Laksa noodles.",

You'll spy traditional noodle dishes from all over Asia: pad thai, vietnamese pho (seafood only), kway teow, HK egg noodle, etc.  We've tried most of their dishes and the only thing that didn't taste \"authentic\" is the singaporean curry rice vermicelli. You can't go wrong with the contrast of crisp-silky agedashi tofu or the yummy crunch of their tempura'd shrimp and veggies. Hey, fried food to soak up all that alcohol, right? (get a bottle of sake while you're at it...)  But what I really love about noodles is the fact that they even offer congee! If there's anything in the world that reminds me of my happy childhood days growing up in Chinatown in Manila, it's CONGEE! I always get the century egg and pork congee here and order the chinese donut to go with it. Yes, this bowl of rice porridge costs $17.50 but what else do you expect? Congee on the strip? at the Bellagio? IN Vegas?  it'll cost you a pretty penny....LOTS of pennies!   Noodles, I got nothing else to say except, after all these years, you're STILL a winner!",

Pomegranate Mai Tai - 10/10 2. Citrus Mojito - 13/10 3. Lychee Martini - 6/10, but was pretty cool cause it was glittery! 4. Oxtail soup - 7/10. It's a hit or miss. Some days it's a 9/10, other days it's a 5/10... :( 5. Wing Zing - 15/10!!! MUST GET. I ALWAYS get this dish. 6. Mandarin beef stew - 7/10, was literally just ok. 7. Chicken satay - 5/10 8. Malaysian style roti prata - 8/10 9. Szechuan spicy fish - 0/10. Ew! Literally so bland and was just drenched in oil. 10. Combo BBQ rice w duck and BBQ pork - 3/10 11. Pad Thai - 5/10. This isn't like pad Thai, it's more like pad see ew or whatever it's called.  12. Vietnamese seafood pho - 4/10. Very flavorless. Don't get this. This shouldn't even be called pho.  13. Fresh young coconut - 10/10. this ALWAYS runs out so come here early! 14. Mango pudding - 10/10. Delicious! 15. Chilled lychees - 3/10. Wouldn't recommend. 16. Crabmeat fried rice - 8/10. Yummy! They actually put a lot of crabmeat in it. 17. Salt and pepper shrimp - 4/10. This really was not salt and pepper shrimp but more of a shrimp drenched in flour and fried with random spices...and still pretty bland.  Overall, this place is really a 3/5 kinda restaurant but 4/4 if you're really hungry. If you don't know what to get, just PLEASE GET THE WING ZING!!!!",

I mean, I get that it's Vegas and everything but seriously $20 for a bowl of Asian noodles that I could probably get for less than $10 at home?! Aside from all that, I was really craving Asian noodle soup; specifically Tom yum & I saw that their menu had it here & since it was in the same hotel we were staying at we decided to come here to try it. We shared a bowl of the spicy Thai shrimp noodle soup which is pretty much a tom yum soup with rice noodles in it. The flavor of the soup was actually really good -- just the perfect amount of spicy & sour. It came with 4 pretty good sized shrimps in it as well. Our bill came out to be $24 after tax & tip for just that one bowl of noodles. I would be back to try the other noodles dishes if only the prices were cheaper.",

Casual dining with a touch of upscale ambiance. The noodle wall is a nice touch.   So glad I didn't let the bad reviews keep me from this place. The food is really good. And so was the service on the night I visited. My tip, stick to the Chinese dishes on the menu and you won't be disappointed.   The wait wasn't too bad even though the line was long. We were seated at the counter/bar near the kitchen and our food came out relatively fast. It was cold so I was in the mood for some good comfort food. Looking over the menu I decided to order the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle Soup (so tender and flavorful) and Shrimp Balls (so good & perfectly crispy). My friend ordered the Fried Rice & BBQ Pork. He said it was really good. I can't speak on the dim sum since we didn't get a chance to order anything other than the Shrimp Balls (since we were too full) but I'll definitely come back to try more. High hopes.   Also, not too sure if they take reservations but it seems like it would be a good idea for larger groups. Date night or eating solo gets seated faster, as with any restaurant.",

Inside of the Bellagio is this restaurant, beautifully decorated with bamboo, wood, and light colors, set back so it's quiet and away from the smoke and slot machines.  To start we got tempura vegetables - awesome! Probably my favorite Japanese appetizer; all nicely friend, crunchy, but soft on the side. Also got the special which came with a small miso, very nice.  We got the spicy beef, and the shrimp with bok choy. I preferred the beef, though they were both really good; The bok choy/shrimp was more fresh with the vegetables, and the beef had the delicious wide noodles and juicy beef. The only downfall was that they both had a bit too much oil; they were almost swimming in it at the end. We'd come back because this place was one of the best meals we had while in Vegas - but would try something else, to try something new but also to see if there's something less oily.",

I had the shrimp fried rice and they piled on the rice and only put two (2) pieces of shrimp on top. This is not an exaggeration.  Also some of the other items on their menu taste cheap like the items that include pork. You can get this low quality food at any dollar menu Asian restaurant off the strip.  Also the Chow Mein plate is awful.  Where are the pretty pieces of vegetable and shoots and green leafy decoration garnish? The plate was so dark and boring and had no flavor. All it had was the noodle and some  bland tasting beef like it came out of a microwave.  We were disappointed with the the low value of this restaurant.

Even though the foods weren't all terrible, I still found it silly that we waited so long in Vegas to have generic Chinese foods.   Dim sums - they have cart service! Genius on their parts since they approach you with the carts while you wait for your entrees. They don't have the price listed on the carts so you are more likely to grab a bunch of overpriced items. Each tiny dim sum dish starts at $7 plus. Although I did enjoy their spare ribs and minced meat in fried footballs, neither were something I was dying to have seconds of. Save your wallet and hold off your dim sum craving until you find yourself in an actual dim sum restaurant.   Hainanese chicken - one of my all time favs ruined here at Noodles. I had to send back my first chicken because the center came out cold (with oozing gelatine/fat). On the second, slightly warmer chicken, the skin was rubbery and meat was extremely tough. The dish was nearly inedible.   Stewed beef noodle and dan dan noodles - the stewed beef was so tough (again) I couldn't get a bite in. My husband however said the noodles were tasty. He also raved about the dan dan noodles. Maybe the restaurant does know a thing or two about Noodles.   Overall - stick to noodle dishes if you are really dying to have Asian foods here in Noodles.",

    "text": "Expensive, but we wanted something local (tucked in a corner at the Bellagio), and a break from the typical bar/burger food that was everywhere in Vegas. Perfect for me and my husband- we were fighting off colds and wanted some comfort food.  Went at 8pm, and were seated by 9pm. In the evenings, there is usually a line, and the later you go, the smaller that line is. Option to make reservations, so you can skip the line. Or you can order takeout at the host stand. One of the hostesses was very busy, going to the line, asking how many people per group, so she could get everyone in faster. She was running back and forth from the restaurant, getting menus, and probably looking at available tables in each waiter's section.   I think the restaurant is fairly large, as in addition to the \"main room\" right when you walk in, I think there were sections to the left and right, but were hidden by walls.   Bar type seating by the kitchen, but there was a lot of foot traffic as the waiters moved back and forth. Really loved the mix of standard tables and long bench tables/seating. Gave a cozy, family vibe to a modern restaurant. The wall of noodles was interesting decor as well.   Our server, Kenny, super friendly! Oh, and everyone here spoke English. With accents, but can definitely understand them without repeating yourself.   Our dishes:  Plain jook - very plain as described and good if you aren't feeling well, want something hot, or a small, simple soup that won't make you full, thirsty, or mess with your taste buds. This was perfect! Although I did add a bit of soy sauce.   Spring rolls -- nothing special here, typical fried appetizer. And appeared to not not have any filling. No vegs, except for a wisp of green that I assumed was cabbage. In fact, was mostly dough, and the dipping sauce was so watery and thin.   Basket of steamed veggies -- after all the Vegas junk eating, craving something fresh. Got very little asparagus, pepper, bok choy, and carrots (1 piece each at minimum, 2 if you were lucky, and 3 if they were feeling generous or mistakenly counted the pieces) and mainly broccoli, yellow squash.   Dory fish with scallions and ginger -- light and flavorful. Ginger was sliced thickly, as opposed to finely chopped/slice, so it's more for garnish than for eating. Fish was subtle, and reminded me of really tender chicken.   Chilean sea bass with black bean and garlic sauce - flaky, juicy, and amazingly delicious with the flavorful sauce. Melt in your mouth tender. Wish we had ordered two of these.   Fish dishes come with rice, but they were not brought out with our food, and it took about 5 or so minutes before we finally flagged someone down. I just chalked it up to being busy.They were very courteous when mentioning this.   We had ordered a lot, and the waiter didn't bring out one of the pan fried noodle/gravy dishes. When we inquired about it, Kenny said it had not been taken down during ordering. So either we confused him or we misheard him when he was reading the order back to us, Lol. Either way, no big deal. We were not charged for it, and he ended up doing us a favor since we were so full from everything and ended up bringing leftovers back upstairs to our room.  Was very expensive, and portions were average at best. However, this is to be expected from Vegas!",

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday afternoon when checking out the Bellagio. It is a cute spot with benches and benches of seating, it was pretty empty when we arrived so we were seated immediately. There are a variety of items on the menu, noodle dishes, rice dishes, soup dishes, etc. This restaurant is pricey, but it is open late night (till 2am daily) so I guess the up-charge is for that convenience.   I ordered the Congee and a Thai Iced Tea. The Thai Iced Tea was average, nothing amazing (refills are not free for this drink). The Congee (rice porridge) was very watery... for $6 it was way overpriced. It is literally rice and water! Most congee dishes I have ordered from other restaurants use a chicken or veggie broth to give the rice some flavor, they do not do that here. There were other congee options on the menu that came with protein that would likely flavor the dish (poached chicken, egg and pork, fish fillet, seafood, abalone). The other congee options were insanely overpriced as well, chicken with some rice and water for $14?! No thanks.... After dumping soy sauce and hot peppers into my congee, it became bearable to eat. My friend ordered the Beef Stew Noodle Soup, the broth was decent, but the beef was too fatty for my taste.  The service was good, our drinks were always refilled and our waitress checked on us numerous times. This is the main reason why I am giving 3/5 stars versus 2/5 stars. The food is really mediocre and overpriced, but again, if you are looking for a late night bite to eat, this spot is available to you. I would not go out of my way to visit this spot again unless I just happened to be at the Bellagio and nothing else was open.",

The menu is extensive and there's a lot to choose from.   We truly wanted to try the curry noodles but they were sold out.  We ended up ordering pad Thai, spicy Thai noodle, and crab fried rice.   Pad Thai was 4/5 not authentic at all but good flavor.  Spicy Thai Noodle was 1/5 flavorless nothing like Tom Ka soup, no coconut milk, no spice.  Crab fried rice 3/5 Solid but nothing special.   I would say this place is mediocre, nothing to die for. Next time we are going to Momofuku.",

    "text": "Some general tips before coming here to increase your chances of a good dining experience.  Tip#1 - do stick with their Chinese dishes, ordering the pad thai or pho is a bad idea.  Unless you are adventurous and curious on how pad thai would taste like if a Chinese person made it.  You get the idea.  Tip#2 - do use your comps here, it's a good way to get a decent meal after a long day to the poker tables.  If you pay out of pocket, expect about $5 to $10 per menu item more than what you would pay in Chinatown (go to Spring Mountain Road).  Tip#3 - don't worry about not speaking Cantonese or Mandarin when coming here, their customer service is efficient and helpful (but not friendly, remember this is a Chinese restaurant).  Tip#4 - do order their crab meat vermicelli with xo sauce ($24), it has tons of real crab meat.  Our waiter Gary from San Francisco (who by the way gave us excellent service) did tell us it's crab meat extracted from the buffet and after tasting a few bites, we confirm it!",

I eventually picked this place because I wanted my family to have Chinese food instead of the American food that you see throughout the strip.  We waited in line for about 30 minutes and was able to get a table by the door.  I ordered watermelon juice, oriental fried rice, roast duck with rice, wonton noodle soup, side of bbq pork and steamed bbq pork bun.  Pretty soon afterwards, our food came one-by-one ...except the bbq pork bun.  We never received the bbq pork bun and had to mention it to our waiter.  So it turns out that the kitchen forgot to steam the buns.  Since we were already full, we told the waiter to just cancel the order.  He then gave us 2 complimentary mango puddings on the house for the mistake.  Overall, the food was delicious and customer service was also good.",

We had the wonton noodle soup, the broth is a clear consume pretty flavorless so I doused mine with some chili sauce. The shrimp wontons were nicely seasoned with salt and seasame oil. But for a 16 medium size bowl of soup- I expected way more  We also tried the shrimp chow mein 18.00 when I am used to paying this price for home made noodles.  For a noodle house- the biggest let down is the noodles are not home made.   Would I return there? Still up for debate. The ladies there are super nice and speak Cantonese!",

Service was great at first but as we finished it started to slow down since there were a bunch of new parties.  I had the pad Thai and my fiance had the black bean beef hor fun. Both dishes used look fun noodles. The pad Thai comes with chicken, beef or shrimp and was on the sweet side. I'm used to pad thai with skinny noodles; however it was still pretty good.

Having said this, it's probably the cheapest eats in the hotel.  As for the food, I've never been disappointed in the 10+ years  I've been coming here.  You need to stick with the authentic dishes on the menu though.    These dishes are very high quality.  If you do go for any of the more North American chinese dishes - well it's a crapshoot.  Lines are typically long so make it an early dinner if you can.  Where else in the Bellagio can you dine for less than $100 for 2, and leave on a very full stomach?",

Personally, I just had a bowl of wonton noodle soup which really hit the spot.  The food seems to leverage the natural flavor of its ingredients rather than MSG that you see in a lot of Asian food.  Some people might see their food as being bland because of this, but personally I enjoyed it.  Oh one final note, this place can build up a line, but the service is insanely fast one you're in.",

I ordered fillet white fish and sea bass. We didn't wait for our food, but after they places the food on the table no servers check us to see how we are doing ? How's the food? I used to be a waitress for 10 years and I've never treated my customer feeling lonely at the table. Then they gave me the check and the waitress tried at the end, but kind of too late and I know expects great tip ! I give good tips if they provide great service and for not so good unfriendly service I gave her 15%.  Anyways this is my 1st and last time visit on this resto. I wouldn't recommend this to place because of average food and bad customer service",

The duck meat is juicy, tender and so flavorful.  Otherwise, the food seems mediocre. I got the Wonton Noodle Soup and it was just okay. The cuisine does lean more towards Hong Kong-style, so that may be why, as I prefer Taiwanese food more. I did want Xiao Long Bao but they stop serving it at 3pm. If you want XLBs or any dim sum, come before then.  Service was great. Great restaurant, but wouldn't go out of my way unless a friend wants it or I happen to already be at Bellagio.",

People do not wait in line for poor food.  So you know this place is legit.  We had roast duck, shrimp tempura, and shrimp shu mai.  The shrimp tempura was good but you can find better in a good Japanese restaurant. The shrimp shu mai was pretty good, but not as good as the dim sum we had in Vancouver.    The 5 stars is earned by the boneless roast duck.  This is quite simply the best duck in America.  It is fatty, plump, and has no bones.  The flavor is on point and one order is less than $20.  A perfect order is rice and two orders of the duck.  It will put you to sleep and eventually save you money since there is not way you are gambling and losing money after eating this bad boy!",

At first glance I thought the restaurant was small, but there's actually more room towards the back. We weren't expecting much from the food because we thought it was going to be Americanized Asian noodles, and we were pleasantly surprised! I had the Penang Kway Teow Flat Noodles and Husband had the Malaysian Beef Stew Noodles. The Flat Noodles were our favorite amongst the two. We even had leftovers which we devoured the next day. The Beef Stew noodles were good, too. It was a nice fix if you're craving something soupy. The meat in it was really tender which we really liked. I would definitely consider this place if I'm craving some Asian noodles next time while I'm on the Strip.",

I've had better from Ling's that I make myself and for $15, it was bad.  Then, I started sipping my $4 ice tea.  $4 for what tasted like used bathwater.  Yuck,  We then choked down the sweet and spicy noodles, which after dressing up with some soy sauce and more hot sauce didn't taste that bad.  But, for $50 for lunch, you can say Overratted.",

    "text": "When we arrived at Noodles ( Mid Saturday evening without a reservation ), and we were seated promptly, assisted by a friendly wait staff and had a really wonderful time! We ordered shrimp dumplings as appetizer which were really yummy but hard to get off the sticky paper in the bamboo steam box. I ordered the lump crab vermicelli and HIGHLY recommend it. It woudl be most comparable to Carbonara on an Italian menu. The flavor was light and without a doubt THE best meal I had the whole time I was in Las Vegas! I will certainly come back when I am back at this resort casino next time.   One note that it was a bit hard to hear the wait staff as the place was very busy shortly after we arrived and my husband ordered a plate with shrimp and got chicken. He was happy with it though so I will say we have no complaints. It was also very reasonably priced. If I had to say something- I wuold suggest descriptions on the menu so people know what they are ordering. That was the hard part- we didnt order anything we didnt recognize by title but were pleased with the food choices. I could see where  this would be harder if someone didnt follow that rule.",

We had the shrimp dumplings, kung pao chicken and yaki udon.  The dumplings were ok.  The chicken was just really bland for something that is supposed to spicy, and the noodles were just bleh.

The small portion of duck was nearly $20 but had a crispy skin, a nice thick layer of fat and juicy salty meat. I also got thin egg noodles with wontons in a soup. It was bland and there was barely enough to share but each of us tried a small bowl.  The noodles themselves and the wontons were fine.   I ordered a plate of fried rice and it was a sorry excuse for the real thing. Absolutely no flavor.  Nothing was greasy so I guess that was a plus and the Thai iced tea was good for a pricey $5.  All in all I paid $58 including tax and tip but the three of us left hungry.  Next time I'll go off-strip.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to love Noodles, but I came away from the meal just thinking it was ok.  In all fairness, we didn't study the menu very well, we were tired and hungry, so we just ordered stuff we would order at home. We ordered shrimp chow mein and a bbq pork and duck plate. The chow mein was fairly good, but I thought it was lacking some flavor. And it only had 4 shrimp in it which was disappointing. The pork/duck plate was really good. The pork was very tender, not dry at all. The duck was not as greasy as you might expect. Unlike the chow mein, both had a lot of flavor.  We both ordered drinks too. I got the White Tiger martini and my bf got the Zombie drink. Now if you order this drink and the server advises \"this is a big drink, is that ok\", she/he doesn't mean its just bigger than say a martini. She/he means that you could probably share it with another person, and it comes in a bowl with a flame in the middle. Craziness.  The bill was just under 115 with tip. On the expensive side for what we got, but we knew that going in. Its defintely not a must eat place for me, but I might go back to try another noodle dish sometime.",

Somewhat of a line but the tables seemed to empty out fast and the staff was quick to clean and ready the table for the next customers.  Our group ordered family style and it truley was an awesome mix of asian dishes.  Ever since then I think everytime I am in vegas around the Bellagio I have taken a trip to Noodles.  Most recently I got there during lunch and they had multiple dim sum carts with a variety of foods to delight any pallet.   Dont forget that this place is open till 2AM which makes it a great drunk treat for any vegas night!  Must try!",

Then I asked her to help with spicy noddles she turned her face and pointed to one item on the menu. Then she said take your time I will be back and started talking to a Caucasian gentleman and laughing and smiling with him. She was very rude to us because we are not Caucasians. I will never go to this place again and I would not recommend here at all. Bad bad service The lady totally ruined my night very upset about it.",

The fish was amazingly fresh for an inland location; they say they get it daily from the LA fish market.  The only thing that keeps me from putting Noodles as a personal 5 star restaurant, was the lack of really unusual sashimi and sushi.

We had good service, but then we did have a VIP guest card so that may have made a difference. Not sure what people expect in term of dishes.

We ordered the pot stickers to start out and thank goodness they came out quick. The sweet and tangy sauce was excellent but the meat inside the pot sticker was a bit chewy.  Tempora shrimp rocked by world in a hearty batter. Spare ribs were next and they were great, a huge portion. The five spice sauce with peanuts was nasty though! Uni yaki noodles were excellent with fresh veggies (red/green bell peppers, onion, mushroom) and pork that was almost better than the spare ribs.  I'm not really sure what the deal is with the African themed decorations but whatever, the foods good.  I thought the set up of the restaurant itself was strange. There were huge tables for large groups but the majority of diners were in groups of 4 or less. Wasted space! Perhaps that's why there was a 30 minute wait on a Sunday evening.",

The decor is nice, but nothing special, and the service is pretty standard, but a hot bowl of noodle soup definitely hits the spot--especially in the very late hours of the night.  Both the sui mai and char siu bau are very good, and I recommend grabbing one or the other as an appetizer, although the latter can take some time to serve freshly steamed during the less crowded hours.  I personally recommend the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  While the Cantonese Dumpling Noodle Soup and Wonton Noodle Soup are decent, I would probably pass on them the next time in favor of less-basic selections.  Noodles is definitely a favored place among Bellagio's Asian clientele.  The large picnic-like tables near the front are perfect for guests bringing large families.

    "text": "I didn't have a high expectation for this place cause people say it's overpriced, and the waitress / waiters are rude. Well, I was impressed cause I had very good experience.  First of all, the food is authentic Hong Kong style. I've never been to Hong Kong but the quality of the food is on par with some of the good Hong Kong style restaurants I've been to in China. We've ordered egg pork congee, stir fried ho fun, and shrimp dumplings, which were all pretty tasty.  As of service, the waitress we had was pretty considerate to ask about our preferences and refilled our drinks in time. Yes, it is a little bit pricey, but it's a restaurant in a top five star hotel. So the price is kinda reasonable especially considering the location, the good quality and generous portion of the food.  I'd recommend this place if you are looking for some good dim sum in town.",

It has the right balance of crab, XO sauce, XO beef strips. Great after late nights drinking or gambling.  Dinner: -XO noodles (Excellent) -Beef stew noodles (Ok) -Hinanese chicken (Ok)",

Looking at the menu and the prices we thought it would be the best but.... It was eh? I made better noodles at home for a cheaper price.  My husband had the Pad Thai with beef and sprouts with nuts on the side which cost $18.50 : we had better for $10 with better noodle texture and sauce. We rate the pad Thai a ** two star out of *****five As for me I had the udon thick Japanese noodle with chicken best n chicken broth. Cost $15.25 I make udon at home everyday n I would say the only highlight from my dish was that, the noodles were cooked to perfection. Not the broth or anything else but the noodle. I had to add soy sauce and other condiments like chili n pepper to make it taste better. This would be a great dish for some one who's on a diet who's trying to cut out salt n flavor out of their body system. I would rate this dish **2 stars out of *****5. The good news is we got our noodle fix even though we could have done better AND we gained more Tier credits for M Life club card. When you spend $34 more in the Bellagio Noodles restaurant you can gain Credits. If your a M Life member. Over all we were some what satisfied. Like 60%",

Yeah, the line to get in can be a bit ridiculous.  The reason why could be the slow service.  And its a crawling pace.  There were table that should have been bussed, but only one bus boy without all the right equipment.  It took almost 5 minutes to clean up one table (from the time they started cleaning, it was probably a good half an hour after the patrons had left). WIth a line outside the door thats unacceptable.    All that being said, the food was good, although $$$.  Expect dishes to range from $15-$25 dollars for stuff that would normally cost at most $10 anywhere else.  The MANDARIN BEEF STEW NOODLE was good. The SIGNATURE PREMIERE RICE hit the spot for me.  The DOUBLE HAPPINESS from the BBQ and Roast section was also quite good (we got Duck and Pork). In general the food was of quality was delicious.  However, the wait, the prices, and the service was not worth it.  Even for Vegas.  If you are looking for good noodle soup with less of a wait, try SEA: The Tahi Experience in Bally's.",

If it has Asian noodles and broth ...I am in!  But not all noodles are created equal and Noodles in the Bellagio gets it right. First the service ....Some of the best of the week so far.  There was a line (always a good sign!) We stood in it for about 15 minutes but the hostess kept us up to date on how long about every three minutes. Really pro. We were seated in the comfortable surroundings of a top grade Asian noodle house. Once in our seats I could smell the aroma of wonderful broth and hear the familiar slurp sound that is a must in a noodle venue. We ordered appetizers. Easy choice was the chicken satay with an amazing peanut dipping sauce. Also sampled the shrimp tempura. So perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination. But the barometer of a noodle house is of course noodles in broth. I added the BBQ pork with egg noodles and the scrumptious bowl wafted out  the smell of the deliciousness to come. A perfectly cooked noodle with a fantastic broth were what i came for and received. I told my wife i could eat all my meals here this week. It was that good. I was pretty sure i picked the right place when I noticed the seventy five percent of the customers were Asian. Always a good sign! I usually rely on Yelp before trying a restaurant but i am glad I did not consult Yelp this time. I might have missed a special treat.",

We went at around 7:30 pm and only had to wait 10 minutes or so for a table on a Friday, which was nice.  Now in Vegas, I 1) wasn't planning on eating any spectacular Chinese food having grown up in San Gabriel Valley, 2) knew I was going to pay up the wazoo for anything.  I came prepared to shell out a bunch of money but it's probably the least amount I've ever spent on dinner in Vegas.  Their portions are pretty big, and I would definitely suggest sharing with the table.  It's always hard to get Chinese food and try and have each person order something since it's meant for sharing.  We started off with the roti prata, which came with this delicious curry sauce that we just started using on the rest of the meal.  We also ordered their Hong Kong style egg noodle, fried rice, Chinese broccoli, and the mixed vegetables.  They were all good, although the oyster sauce for the Chinese broccoli was waaay salty (which is why I'm happy we got it on the side).  Overall, the food kept us full for the most part, and although pricier than most Chinese places, doesn't break the bank.  Not 100% sure I would come back since there are so many different restaurants in Vegas, but not a bad option if you're in the area.",

My friend got the combination rice which came with roasted duck which was a bit tastey and the soya chicken which came out cold and not very flavorful.  I guess vietnamese or asian food is considered exotic espeically in vegas therefore they feel that they can jack up the prices really high.

How can you mess up this type of food if that's what you specialize in? Tasted like one of those low budget Chinese/Vietnamese buffets to me. Will not be going back.",

    "text": "My best friend is Asian and his superstitious tendencies say that if you eat noodles on your birthday, you will have a long life.  I won't lie, my mom tells me the same thing.  Anyhow, with that state of mind; he started his search for a place to eat, which he had never tried.  Alas, Yelp led him to a place called Noodles in the Bellagio.  Looking for a place to eat noodles... what better place to go than a restaurant called Noodles!?  Blah!!!!!  Pros:     * Very Beautiful Atmosphere   * located inside Bellagio (fancy schmancy)   * spacious seating w/ large family style tables   * diverse selection of noodles from pho to singapore noodles   * large portions   *  The sauce that came w/ the calamari had a nice kick to it.   * Hor Fun was Yum Yum. Cons:   * I haven't been to Bellagio on a Saturday in awhile, but let me tell you... Parking sucks!  No exaggeration, I was looking for parking for 45 minutes.   *  Way over-priced, but this was expected for a fancy restaurant.   *  The quality of the food sucked.  I'll talk more about that later   *  The wait to get in the restaurant was almost an hour.   *  After getting seated, it took the server 25 minutes before saying hi   *  Took nearly 10 minutes for water   *  Server forgot to bring my friends soda (she had to ask 2 times)   *  My tea took another 10 minutes to bring  Ordered:   Calamari - I'm a big fan of calamari, but this was chewy in a bad way.   Hot Tea - nearly $9, but it does serve 4 so it's not too bad   Singapore Noodles - definitely not what i expected, big portion though   Ice Water- if you want water, get it w/ lemon to mask that \"tap\" taste   Total cost:  nearly $40.00 !  Verdict:   *  I wouldn't recommend this place.  I have no intention of coming back.  I do love that the portions were heaping, but I didn't really enjoy it much (at least not the Singapore Noodles).  My best friend ordered the Duck.  It was crispy on the outside, but the meat itself was a bit dry.  My friend's girlfriend ordered the Hor Fun.  This was pretty good.  If I had to come again, I'd definitely would order this.  I expected it to cost me what it did, but for that price, I was disappointed with the quality of the food (maybe I just didn't order the right stuff.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt) and definitely was not satisfied with the service.  Eek!  Me thinks not !  Tips:   * go to Chinatown off Spring Mountain... there's plenty of selection for a quarter of the price.   * you know how some place have water that has that weird taste, yea... Noodles has that type of water so get a hot tea or soda.   *  Hor Fun was Fun indeed.  It's a safe bet for your Noodle virgins",

    "text": "True, this place is pricey for noodles, but they are damn good. I always come here every time I am in Vegas even if I am not staying at the Bellagio.  Case in point, last Saturday night after my gf's wedding reception at the Hilton.  We were hungry, so we cabbed it and were seated right away. Yes, the service is rude, but what do you expect from a Chinese run place? They are def not known for their service and I am Chinese.   On to the food-  Cantonese dumpling soup- pretty good, tasty and light. Clear broth with egg noodles. You get a choice of 4 different noodles, but egg noodles is the best one to go with dumplings.  Beef stew noodle soup- OMG. this is like an orgasm for meat lovers. It came with 4 HUGE ass chunks of stewed beef. The meat was so tender and easy to eat. It had a bit of a kick, mmmmm spicy, just the way I like it. I had it with the big flat rice noodles (chow fun).   Would I recommed this? Hell yeah. Especially late night after lots of alcohol. Your belly will thank you in the morning.",

I had to use half a tub of chili paste mixed with soy sauce to taste anything. The saving grace is very good service.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the food, just won't be going back. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.",
