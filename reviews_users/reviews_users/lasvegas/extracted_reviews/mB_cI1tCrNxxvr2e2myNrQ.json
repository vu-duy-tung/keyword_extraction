    "text": "At first I thought the idea of this was really great. But I had some thoughts on improvement for Taco Bell Cantina. When you're order is finished, an employee yells out your order name. They also show if your order has been completed on a screen. I just wish it was more organized. The store itself looks really awesome but I wish it was bigger. Also they have merchandise downstairs but I feel like it makes the lobby even more cramped when trying to place your order. I ordered a blue  raspberry freezer with vodka. But it just didn't taste strong at all. I just think $10 for a small alcoholic freezer is too highly priced yet it should still taste like there's alcohol in it. I think it's a great spot to hang out and overall I enjoyed it. I just think this great idea could be improved.",

    "text": "Omg, the experience was ridiculous!!!! Let me begin. So this was the last choice to eat as the first place where we wanted to go, closed early. We arrived at Taco Bell around 3:40am. We placed our orders at 3:47am and 3:48am in different lines. The place was super busy so a wait was expected, however no more than 20mins. I received my food around 4:00am and my friend should have received her food shortly after. That did not happen. Politely, around 4:10a, we asked the status of her order. I said, \"Ma'am we place our orders relatively around the same time, my friends food should have been out by now.\" Rudely, the cashier said well everybody is waiting so just wait. I explained how close we ordered and she went to say, well food comes in different lines and different lines get the orders at different times. I was trying to explain that even so, over 6 ppl got their food after we ordered, but she wasn't trying to listen. Both the shift lead and the cashier just brushed the situation off. Mind you, it had already been over 20mins. The place was chaos. So we waited and it became around 4:25, the lady finally looks our receipt and makes this face and then told us that someone \"got her food accidentally\". We finally received her food after 4:30am, nearly close to an hour after we ordered. The place was horribly ran and needs better organization.",

Management didn't seem to care, no one lifted a finger, everyone stared at us with blank eyes, and the security guard tried to kick my friend out when she started crying (I had to stay and calm him down, of course she started crying her purse was just stolen!). Someone told me this happens a lot at this restaurant SO BEWARE. Honestly, it's just a taco bell that serves alcohol. When the purse was \"miraculously\" found by the security guard 20 minutes later in the men's bathroom trash can (of course the one place I couldn't look), the entire Taco Bell staff looked at us like we were diseased when we walked in, while the manager stared at us from the corner texting on his phone. Have you ever heard of customer service? Being apologetic? Don't waste your time coming here, and go to any of the other millions of Taco Bell locations. I am beyond appalled.",

I went on a Wednesday night around 9PM to be blown away by their selection.  I am not a huge fan of fast food unless its the only option but I love Taco Bell in that sense, plus this one serves booze and who can turn that down? The store front hosts outdoor seating with a lit walkway, displaying the store in its glory. There is an upstairs with more seating as opposed to the ground floor which is mostly for ordering food/drink and buying Taco Bell merchandise. They showcase tons of drinks and the full menu with tons of liquor and beers.  I ended up getting a crunch wrap supreme with two hard tacos and a Margarita (Baja Blast with two shots of 1800). Honestly I couldn't have had a better time and think as minute as it may be, Taco Bell Cantina is a staple point to the classic Vegas Trip.",

It's definitely Vegas party scene meets Taco Bell.   The twisted freezes are fun to try out but weren't anything special to me. Its just a shot of alcohol into a regular Taco Bell freeze, but the idea of drinking at Taco Bell makes it worth.    The food prices were not that bad for a restaurant on the strip! They offer the typical Taco Bell menu along with some plates meant to share with friends. They also had a really good $5 deal that came with a drink and 4 food items.   Overall, I think the T-Bell cantina is a unique experience if you are visiting the Las Vegas strip, but I wouldn't be coming back as a regular.",

After two people received their orders I went to the cash wrap to get ignored until someone asked me if I need help. Not to mention I came on a Monday and it was slow at 12:30am.   Long story short I got my meal after 20-25 minutes of waiting and my friends got their order and were finished. It was annoying.  Normally I give good reviews but this pissed me off. lol",

Most people coming in have drunk munchies so I didn't see too many people taking advantage of beer and blended blast cocktails. We did though. With our Cheesy Gordita Crunches and Nachos Bell Grande we got a Stella. Our daughter got a blended blast that came in a souvenir cup she was stoked about. Our beer had a magnet to keep in it too. Our food was Taco Bell standard but non of the condiments were stocked. No napkins. The one rack of napkins by the food pick up was blocked by a herd of humans waiting for food. The scary part of our visit was if we'd get our food or not. They don't check receipt and write a name on your food take out, then set food down, call a name and walk away from it. Pretty risky. Had to shoulder to shoulder with the herd and jump in to grab our food to be sure we got it before someone else could. Managed to find three mild packets of sauce, asked the sea of people to part for some napkins, ate our food at a semi cleaned window seat and bailed. We at least can say we tried it.",

    "text": "So I'd heard about a zany Taco Bell where they sold alcohol. Not 100% sure what to expect, while killing alot of time before a show, I found my way over there and decided to check it out. It's over by the Paris Casino, I took some photos of the Eiffel tower next to that big blue balloon while walking here.       Once you're in the area, it's not hard to find. Listen to the ridiculously loud thumping club music. There are a couple of 'fancy' restaurants over here. There's a Bubba Gumps nearby, and Gordon Ramsey also has a place nearby. There are also some fast food places here, there's a Mcdonalds, a Subway, a Krispy Kreme...and this place.     It's actually a pretty small space. Pretty much your standard Taco Bell sized place. But it surely throws a big aura. Loud thumping club music blares from their patio area. There's a great big swirling machine with flashing lights behind the cash registers and employees.       The menu is pretty standard, except you can get alcohol here. The big swirling lighted machines behind the registers are dispensing alcoholic slushies. Much like the kind you get at other places on the strip. After looking up and the menu board, I settled upon a quesadilla and a beer. Girl behind the counter was nice and friendly as she took my order.       She popped an empty cup on the counter and beer swirled up into it. From the Bottom. The cups are bottom fed. That's nutty. I think that wowed me more than the whole place. But ya. Alcohol. Taco Bell. Music. That's pretty much it. But it's really neat. You should go check it out if you're looking for the weird and wacky in Las Vegas.      There's an upper floor, but it was cordoned off on my visit because people were getting married up there. Ya. People get married at a Taco Bell. In Las Vegas. Man. With each discovery like this I kinda like this city more and more.",

It's open 24 hours and all the same food items you'd expect from any other Taco Bell is there.  The catch is you can get beer & Twisted Freezes.....  I wasn't interested in the food this time around and instead went with the Baja Blast Twisted Freeze with rum.  Highly recommend.  You also have the option to put tequila or vodka depending on your preference.   The Taco Bell pretty much has a mini bar/club vibe.  There's two floors, with the first floor for ordering/buying souvenirs and the top floor for seating.  The seating on the top floor is limited, but there's patio style seats with a view of the Strip. There are charging ports everywhere, which is cool  The other cool thing is that there is a ginormous screen containing 16 mini-TV screens to watch whatever you like.  If you like Taco Bell and you like Vegas, you can't go wrong coming here!",

    "text": "Taco Bell Cantina = small but flashy taco bell that serves alcohol.  Although Taco bell is not of my one regular fast food picks, on NYE I decided to check out the \"upscale version\".  This taco bell has a standard menu plus tapas-style sharing plates of nachos, quesadillas, and chicken fingers.The cantina's \"Freeze Wall\" of customizable slushies includes flavors margarita, pina colada, berry blast and provide the option to add liquor: tequila, rum, vodka.  Atmosphere: Space is tight. Given on NYE they hosted an event on the upper level, seating was not available & it was standing room only. We managed to grab a standing spot right in front of the window that looks into the kitchen. It may have been because of NYE, but the music was very loud. Club loud..which is great, when you're at a club. However, the loud music made it extremely difficult to order and respond to the cashier.  Order: Decided to try the baja blast freeze with vodka...intending to just try it in their standard cup. As a local, i don't need the gimicky souvenir twist cups. Unfortunately, with the loud music and lack of clarification by the cashier, we ended up with their souvenir twist cups (and their additional cost).  Service: I spotted an employee carrying a tablet, but noticed that she skipped over me to ask another person ( 2 people behind me) if they wanted to place their order thru the tablet. I feel that the error with my drinks would not have been made if I had tablet ordered & saw it on the screen as opposed to attempting to lip read the cashier.  Delivery: Your name will appear on the TV screen when your order is ready. When I saw my name under the \"Ready\" side, I maneuvered up to the crowded counter, only to be told that my order was not ready. Standing back a bit, they called my name a few moments later & handed me a bag of food. Opened the bag...to find that it was NOT what I had ordered. We ordered 3 $5 Cravings boxes..My sister returned the bag with someone else's order and we were given our 3 boxes.   Taste: It's a Taco Bell & the cravings boxes are no different from the ones you get elsewhere.",

    "text": "Awesome experience! Highly recommend the Baja Blast which is the most popular flavor. It's a cool twist on a traditional Taco Bell and the location is pretty good. Not to mention that all the margs have a variety of flavors and it's the only Taco Bell to serve alcohol.  Interesting fact - if you sit upstairs there is a camera that shows you on the big screen. ALSO, you can get married here if you've really got a thing for drunk Mexican food",

We arrived at this place around lunch time on Monday, which was our last day in LV. We decided to grab lunch before heading to the airport. I will say the place is smaller than I expected. It looked bigger on tv. It was moderately busy around 12. It's two stories which is cool but the layout to thr counter is odd. Your mixed in with their Taco Bell souvenirs. Can be tight if people are just shopping for that.   The line moved pretty quickly as it does at any TB. I'm not much of a drinker so I got a slush drink virgin style. I got the blue one, totallt forgot the flavor but it was good and not too sweet at all, which was a plus. I ordered a simple soft taco with chips ans cheese too. I wasnt too hungry.   They have a nice seating area outside with heatlamps which came in handy when we came. We had our luggage so we didn't go upstairs.   I can imagine this place gets busy at night, if you're wanting to check it out I would during the day. Cool spot!",

I was expecting the prices to be insane and the food to be gross but it was the opposite. It's like a normal Taco Bell except more hip ;). You're able to have fun at the same price as any other Taco Bell. They have a self serve soda machine that was pretty cool! They had a dj playing upstairs which fits in perfectly in Vegas!! I'll definitely stop by next time I'm in Vegas for reasonable prices and yummy Taco Bell.",

Unfortunately, my experience quickly became really frustrating due to terrible customer service, specifically by Caitlin. I asked if there was any water to fill my cup at the fountain drink station, and Caitlin was quick to dismiss me, saying there was only bottled water several times and with attitude. Being from Arizona where it's illegal to not serve tap water for free, I was confused by this and tried to clarify why there wasn't any water. Caitlin demonstrated very little patience and was very dismissive. I am extremely disappointed in Caitlin and her customer service, and I won't be back because of her.",

I had 2 of my friends with me who I dragged with me and didn't understand why I really wanted to go to THIS taco bell. We order our food and I bought a shirt. My friends got combos but we're not told that the fountain drinks machine was down: maybe 2 drinks worked out of 7-10 like the Mt dew and tea... so my friends waiting after being told that they were going to \"fix\" it. After the long wait my friend has had enough.  No name tags on either \"upper management\" team that she spoke to. Finally one of them told her what the real issue was and that no one really complains about it.  He avoided giving a refund and didn't offer a slushy for guest satisfaction.  I hate to say this comment because I've heard it many times but as management in the food and ever age business you give the guest what they want or the alternative to make their experience a little better. This guy finally caved and gave my friend $1 from his own wallet.  Look again coming from food and beverage I know that guy was upset and just wanted this guest out of his face but to not even offer the alternative like a slushy  (minus the alcohol)  and to assume we would just brush it off because it's Vegas ... no",

Seating is indeed limited but apparently we got there during a lull, so we were able to pick a spot out front with the fans that blow mist around. The staff looked a bit stressed but were handling themselves well, pushing out orders in a timely fashion. The young lady who handled our order was keeping cool under pressure and seemed relieved that we were patient and goofy, as we always are. It was awesome to get a Baja blast with tequila. I feel this place is a bit understaffed because the outdoor area was pretty dirty, but I'm sure that can be resolved.",

    "text": "Coming to Vegas, I was aware of the hype surrounding Taco Bell and their flagship Cantina location in Las Vegas. After watching multiple videos on Facebook, I knew that stopping here was an absolute must when visiting Vegas. This Taco Bell is open 24 hours a day and is great for a post-game meal because you can have awesome fast food, over priced (but delicious frozen liquor), and a DJ spinning some good tunes.  I brought 15 people here to conclude our trip to Vegas and everybody was very happy that we came. The food is as delicious as any other Taco Bell across the United States with some additional menu items. The drinks, extremely overpriced ($15) but well-worth the experience, were quite tasty definitely a must-try at least once in your life.  They also sell cool T-shirts and sweaters that are reasonably priced ($20-25 for a t-shirt).   All in all, a very cool experience and definitely a good way to end a brief Vegas vacation!",

The line was relatively short, the fact that there was a line at 6AM was the most surprising part.

(Unless you live there that is). I was instantly enamored with the atmosphere. You use a kiosk to place your order and that allows you to also customize your order. They then have a display screen to let you know they're working on your order and when you can pick it up. It's got 2 levels with a view down to the bottom as well as TV screens. While the alcohol prices seemed a little high compared to where I'm from, it does the high prices of the area. I would definitely come back.",

Initially came here to drink and eat Taco Bell in the middle of the night like everyone else who comes to Vegas.   I had higher expectations for my experience here, but was sadly disappointed. Someone ordered a bunch of food ahead of me, made some upgrades and then decided to remove items--this caused the one open register to freeze. Unfortunately, it took the staff a while to just open another till. It would have been convenient earlier to open more registers for the amount of staff they had and to notify the long line that there were issues with that one register. By the time I ordered I just wanted food. So, I can't say much about their speciality drinks! Maybe next time.  Also, I didn't like that I was able to see how they prepared food. Kitchen staff didn't put the wrap paper down on the countertops before making the food. I've worked food service before and had to deal with high volume orders, but I still managed to practice proper food handling protocols.",

Went on a Saturday afternoon and this place was blasting some of the best hip hop on the strip! We could hear their music a mile away and casually walked in to find everyone dancing and my lord was it a party in there!   Maybe it's the music or the fact that we were in Vegas, but the food just tasted 10x better at this place. They have some items that aren't on your normal TB menu (like the quesadilla nachos) and they were bomb. I got my go-to gordita crunch and it was bangin'. Food came out reasonably fast and even the employees were having a good time while making our food! Did I mention it's two stories? And that they serve Fat Tuesday-style alcohol drinks but in their TB flavors? Oh, yes. Yo quiero Taco Bell, Cantina!",

Alcohol is small concert venue priced.   There's not much more to it. Pictures make it seem like it's bigger than it is, but even though it is 2 floors, combined they add up to be the size of your normal t-bell.   Beers available are going to be your average selection that you'd find at strip bars. Those Baja Blast daiquiri drinks are worth having, get the extra shot.   Taco Bell Cantina is cool, I expected a tiny bit more because of how mainstream this location is, but I was not necessarily disappointed. I wouldn't do it again, but you've got to do it at least once.",

We came here to check it out, ordered 2 boozy Baja Blasts and he got a double decker.

However, this is not the case, you simply can choose any, available, alcohol you want. There is a 10 dollar and a 16 dollar slushie option, when ordering a meal and a slush, the slushie price drops to 12.50! All the slushie flavors are phenomenal and the food/tocaos were fuller, if that makes any sense.

I have never been so disappointed with any food place in my life. Completely unprofessional and this guy is not only a bully but also had a major ego problem for being a manager at a Taco Bell.... wrote this all in the tellthebell survey but doubt that will ever do anything.   Veggie buyers beware they will think it's funny to feed you meat, don't waste your time or money.",

Good spot to socialize and grab a bite. The menu options are dirt cheap and I have no clue how YUM makes money with such cheap food. Dollar menu cheap burritos you name it they have it for fantastic drink food. Hey also have alcoholic slushes which are a PLUS.",

Plus Taco Bell is my last choice to eat while in Vegas, but you do what you got to do with limited time and two preteens in tow.  If you've got a good buzz, and need drunk buzz food that is fast than obviously this is your place. But Vegas rocks when it comes to great food, so take your drunk or sober asses over to something that is more memorable.",

My friends who came over to meet meAFTER I ordered, they ordered and got their food BEFORE I did!  The expo did a terrible job at calling out names and did a terrible job trying to reassure me my food was coming.. because it obviously wasnt!

Altogether was about $26 which I was surprised bc of the drinks well I had to go back to order another drink bc they apparently didn't hear me order the second drink and missed my meal on our order altogether the first time. Got my drink husband ate his food while I'm still waiting for mine 20 mins pass I looked at my receipt turns out they didn't put my food on my 2nd order at all but charged me $27 for one drink maybe if it wasn't so ridiculously loud they could hear the orders and not have so many mistakes they look at you and say \"ok what else\" but apparently they are just trying to hurry you along. I understand the music being loud bc I mean VEGAS right but seriously $27 for one drink on top of that charging for a \"double shot\" when I definitely didn't order a double & it cost more than our entire first order. Insane. Loved the ambiance and experience of it bc why not but check your receipt at this place, always!!!",

When you walk in, you might be a little impressed by the cool decor and the cool alcoholic freeze drinks they have, but once you order food you'll see how they really screwed up their process. Walking in, it's not clear how many lines there are. Although you may be quick to order food, a huge crowd forms waiting for their order. They have a screen that shows names of people who have ordered but the food is in the process of being made and then another list of people whose food is ready. It says it's ready but it's really not. The service looks chaotic. They have a clear glass so you can see them working and constructing your order but they do it out of order and they can't get their orders straight. They mess up orders and then are rude about it when you point out something is missing or that an order was made incorrectly. They write your name on the paper bag but when you go to accept it, they don't trust you and won't give it to you unless you have your receipt. We went late at night on Saturday after going out, and I understand everyone has the munchies and is a little unkind because of all the drinking but even at 3am, I'd like the level of service I expect during any other time of the day.   It's just disappointing to see a brand new place have such terrible processes in place, it just doesn't make sense and is unorganized. It's also frustrating for me to watch through the glass window all the chaos. Somebody should have thought through this better and I hope they change some processes, they'd get more business and profits that way. Sorry to say I am not coming back.",

I definitely like the second floor, there's a lot of comfy couches for you to sit on, even a little DJ booth, I'm guessing there's live music here on certain nights.

    "text": "Say What?! Putting a place like Taco Bell Cantina on the strip AND making it 24 hours was one of the best ideas EVER... like seriously it's a Taco Bell on steroids! So I've known it's been open for a while but how often as a local do we really travel on down to the strip if it's not absolutely necessary? Anyways my niece flew out from Minneapolis for her bachelorette party and I somehow got talked into walking the strip and \"turning up\" with her and some of the bridesmaids. SO fun! Well after all that walking and drinking you know what happens after a while right? You get hungry! As we were headed down the escalators from Planet Hollywood we saw this HUGE billboard with Taco Bell featuring this new Doritos Chicken Nugget thing, sounds gross right, but it wasn't and I don't know if it was the alcohol or not but it looked pretty damn good to me. When you first arrive they have some security that is checking ID's for all those underage kids trying to be grown and drink. NOPE! This place was awesome once you are in they play some really good music and the vibes are just amazing. We had people dancing in the line with each other and just having a good time. Hell if I didn't know any better I would've thought that this was CLUB TACO BELL! I was all for it! The fact that they have a ton of different frozen mixed drinks to wash down your late night meal is even better! Did I mention that they also have some pretty awesome souvenirs and Taco Bell Apparel?! Dope! Once you place your order they actually take your name and have it put up on a screen so you know that your order is being worked on. Like many other places there is that once person that has the coolest job of calling out your name when it is ready... There is always that one person who like to give a funny name just so that when they scream it out it's redundant but FUNNY! Overall we had a blast here and I can honestly say I shall return!",

It still blows my mind that they manage to get their food to taste the same in all 1,000,000,000,000 locations. I don't remember quite exactly, but I think prices are a bit higher than normal TBellz but guys it's the strip and they need to pay rent too!  THE BAJA BLAST: HONEY LISTEN it is dangerously delicious. I got it with Bacardi and I could not taste the alcohol, just all delicious Baja Blast Freeze. I honestly thought they forgot the alcohol but I was content with a regular too, but the buzz was nice. The \"yard\" is actually fairly small because it's tall and really skinny. I am saving my yard cup for the next time I'm in Vegas to get a cheaper refill, and can't wait to try other flavors.  Job. Well. Done.",

    "text": "To you it may not be anything special, but to me this place has a hold of my heart. Taco Bell, although not good for you, is actually delicious to my little belly. I grew up on Taco Bell. I remember walking to the nearest one near school and getting tacos and burritos galore. Ever since I heard this one was opening at the planet hollywood and WITH alcohol I really wanted to check it out! Finally, cinco de mayo gave me an opportunity to try out what I've been missing. Because it was a special occasion, there was a DJ blasting music, GOOD music, making you wanna dance, and it lured us in. The girls were walking around selling tequila shots! It felt like a mini club! But with hella cheap food. The price is the same on the menu as it would be off the strip and that's what I love so much. They have all the different slushee drink flavors that you can choose from and have it with or without alcohol. We ordered two shots, a margarita slushee, a taco supreme, and a taco burrito. They have patio, inside, and upstairs seating. We went upstairs only to find the DJ and more condiments. It was an awesome experience, the place was clean, the people were full of energy, and it was just a lot of fun. Our food was ready, we took our shots, devoured our food, and I didn't want it to end. I never thought I would ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but for that night and experience, they deserved them all. Thank you for giving my boyfriend and I an amazing experience that we will always remember!",

Because I was standing there for 10 more minutes even after my name showed up on the screen because the lady said that the order wasn't ready yet.

They have four of those poo-covered tablets when you walk in, but no orderly way to queue around them. You have to kinda guess which tourist currently at them looks the least stupid / intoxicated and get right up behind them and squah up to establish an alpha presence. I'm on a boycott of these things though because studies have shown there is literal feces bacteria and all sorts of stuff all over them, as heaps of people touch up on them in between cleanings. What happens in Vegas stays on the ordering screens ... give that one a nice think-over before supper.   So! Taco Bell customer my son. You are gender-unspecified adult now and yu must choose. Beautiful clean cash register, or designated poo tablet? Fortunately, they do seem to allow you to order food at the bar - though when I tried that when I first came in, nobody came out, and only after I retreated to a tablet and a line formed at the bar did someone emerge to take orders.   Ordering at the bar also seems to vault your order ahead of the poo screen orders, as I watched five bar people who I saw in line after I finished get their food before my order came up.   So I guess you have to know what to do coming in (ORDER EVERYTHING AT THE BAR) but it's one of the few affordable food options on the Strip. The alcoholic drinks are kinda pricey though, the smallest one is $10.",

I feel that my journey with loving Taco Bell has culminated in this pilgrimage to the LV strip Taco Bell, the nicest and best-tasting Taco Bell I've ever been to.  There's two floors and alcoholic Fat Tuesday style drinks ($15 which seems about reasonable for the area) and merch! There's a bar and dj upstairs with lounge style seating. We parked at the planet Hollywood garage and it was a bit of a walk but entertaining nonetheless bc you can walk through a mall to get there. Service was really fast even tho it was crowded.  They have naked chicken chips ($5)! And fun apps like cheesy jalapeno dippers and little quesadilla bites. Probably not worth it but you can't get them anywhere else. The $ menu here is more expensive than other places, about $1.20-$1.40.   Also the cravings deal here comes with chips and cheese and not the gross cinnamon twists! Plus they grilled my burritos without me even asking.  This is the greatest Taco Bell I've ever been to. The food was the most nicely made of any Taco Bell I've ever been to, and I think anyone who loves Taco Bell has to make the trip here.   If you don't like Taco Bell you probably still won't like this Taco Bell LOL but it's entertaining nonetheless  Also when I came here there were a bunch of people eating chipotle inside, what's up with that",

It's one of the first places that we visited on The Strip the first time that we came to Las Vegas, and it's a blast every single time!  It's open late, and is always full of people, and has music blasting at all hours!    The interior feels almost like a club, with colorful, bubbly water tanks above the different slush and alcohol dispensers, a dim ambience, loud club music, and an amazing upstairs loft area!  The main seating downstairs is the patio outside, which has a fun vibe and is good for people watching, but my favorite spot to sit is in one of the comfortable booths in the loft upstairs!  It feels more like a club than a Taco Bell!!    I love coming here and just sharing a huge plate of crunchy taco supreme's and getting one of the big slush drinks with vodka in it!  It's around $15 for the large, which is better value than most of the other places with similar drinks on The Strip!  So much fun!!  Not to mention the fact that you can get married here for $600, if you wanted to!!  I love the Taco Bell on the Vegas Strip!  It's such a blast, and I come here every time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Visited this establishment with a party of 6 during a weekend evening.  Atmosphere: Poppin'! This is the most lively, colorful, engaging, and almost attractive Taco Bell you will ever go to. There was litter on the ground when I entered, but that's a quality shared with all of the places on the Las Vegas Strip. There are two levels to this Taco Bell, so you can eat inside, or looking down from above next to a giant television.  Service: Quick! There is a ticket system that calls you up when your order is ready. They were very fast with my order.  Food: It's definitely Taco Bell. So what do I mean when I say, \"It's definitely Taco Bell\"? Typical \"Mexican\"-inspired fast food with an American twist. Nothing special. But the chicken chalupas that were on the menu at the time were definitely something special! Also, they serve alcohol here.  Summary: A great experience for a fast food joint Want to see Taco Bell brought to another level? Go to this place! Definitely a Taco Bell of the future. I would not go for the food, but the establishment is something else.",

That aside, the review is so low because of the slow service.  I literally saw everyone that ordered after me getting their food before me.  When I questioned them on this I was told to just look at the board that has our names on it.  My order was a taco and a burrito, yet people that I watched order later than me, and with 10 item orders, were getting there food first.   Grrrrrr",

The prices stay the same as most other Taco Bells, which was great because cheap food on the Strip is amazing to find. We mostly went there for the Twisted Freezes which were absolutely delicious and such a better price than other yard sticks you find on the Strip. Way nicer set up than other Taco Bells as well.

    "text": "What an interesting and fun Taco Bell that is located on the Strip.   I came here mid-morning and the place was busy, but not too busy. They have inside seating but it's upstairs and they also have outside seating on the covered porch. I always enjoy eating outdoors, so this was a very nice treat.   The guy at the register was very friendly and took my order quickly. I decided on the naked egg taco bundle that came with two tacos made of egg (the shell part) potatoes, bacon, cheese both shredded and nacho cheese sauce.  This was my first time trying this and it was surprisingly better then I expected. I would definitely order it again. This cost $3.49.  As I waited for my food to come out, I looked over the menu and saw that most of the items weren't much more than off the strip. This is a great thing for those that don't want to spend a lot of money on something quick.   This Taco Bell offers alcoholic drinks as well as clothing items. Not sure I'd ever buy any clothing items with taco bell on it, but if you're into stuff like that, they offer it here.   When you place an order, your order is displayed on a digital screen. This is a nice feature so you can see when your order is ready without having to listen to your number.   Would come back again.",

I will say the food was pretty consistent with other Taco Bell's I've been to butttt their menu did have more items than your regular Taco Bell. For starters this place serves alcoholic drinks, which I've never seen before at a Taco Bell! It also has two levels and a DJ?! It's like the after party while you're trying to eat some grub. Loved it! Super fun environment and people watching here is prime after 2 am. Def recommend for any tourists!",

They serve alcohol and fat tueday style drinks. I was able to get the nacho fries bell grande. Im glad those are back.  The playlist is bumpin and it we cool to see the staff dancing to the music. The soda fountain looks like beer taps. Upstairs their is additional seating, a bar and a bunch of TVs. A lot of the tables have outlets and bag hooks. Only negative is that there is one single person bathroom.  I just imagine that being bad on a crowded summer day.",

Location signs for Taco Bell is a bit tough as I passed it the 1st time. The sign is located about 20 feet above and if you walk by, you'll miss it. I saw a cardboard sign that states \"Come in we're open\" w/ TB logo.   It's Taco Bell, if you're a fan you'll love. If you drink, you'll love it more as this is a Cantina version. Other than that, better choices here on the strip for breakfast and coffee.",

There's more finger food, and of course, the alcohol infused concoctions. My favorite is Jack Daniels in a frozen mountain dew Baja blast.   The regulars and favorites from any location, chalupas, bean burritos, tacos (naturally), are all available. Just some different styles of the quesadilla with better salsa which is really cool. Maybe we'll see the \"Cantina\" style TB expand to other cities, but it's fun to visit and people watch while eating. The later in the day and night, the more fun it gets. Oh, and I do believe this location is open 24/7.",

They had the regular menu, but you could add alcohol to the freezes. Seating was located upstairs or on the front patio.  They even had an exhibition window so you can see your food being prepared.  Food was the same, cheap and filling! The employees were having a great time, singing and dancing to the current jam being played! I counted that as another free show, lol!",

I substituted the drink for one of their twisted alcoholic drinks. They have a bunch of frozen drinks in the machines and you can choose what kind of shots you want in them. These are $10, a bit steep cause the cups are that big. The cravings box was a very good deal, it came with a good amount of food. I shared with a friend and it was quite filling. I don't think I would've been able to finish one on my own.",

Coming from a family of Taco Bell aficionados' (my brother in particular) this place was a standout of our trip. Food is consistent with what you'd get at other Taco Bells, but there are some standout experiential aspects of the place.  Highlights are... - Taco Bell swag available for sale (we bought a sweatshirt and hat which have been great) - Open window into the kitchen (very cool if you've ever wanted to see the interworkings of a major foodservice chain up close and personal). - Outdoor seating (great for people watching on the strip) - Alcoholic freezes (fun but taste what you'd expect from a shot of tequila in a slushy)",

I have been to this Taco Bell 6 Times since my trip here. This makes every Taco Bell seem like a c lister, It will never be the same for me! The quesadilla is stuffed to the brim with cheese, chicken and sauces; everything comes out fresh, you can see them cookin It up in the kitchen! Everything is hot, the tortillas are soft, and the sauce is flowin!!! Probably going to go there for dinner too. Now on to the service, the customer service is on point. Everyone is so kind and It majorly enhances the experience, whether I'm sober and starving, or wasted at 4 am, they are happy to have us there!! And at night the music is bangin! -Better than the club selection. I love you forever TBell.",

It's located outside of the PH Miracle Mike shops so it was very convenient. I have to say that the staff was awesome. I was trying to ponder what to get and he was very patient. He heard me asking my kids what kind of slush they wanted & they had no idea what Mountain Dew was & he was kind enough to give them samples. All slushees are alcohol free until you add it in and how many shots. The food was meh, but it's Taco Bell. It's what you expect. However, the inside was hip and modern and I forgot I was in a Taco Bell. Impressive is there is an upstairs where the bathrooms are and they are clean! And don't stink inside lol. There is also ample seating upstairs with a bar! What???? It's a must visit to say you've been there. Kind of cool as I saw a video about this Taco Bell so I can say we were there!",

Long story short I meant to write a review thanking him for coming up to my drunk friend and I and giving her a free water bottle and checking up on her.

The Baja blast is the best flavor but today I shook it up a bit and got blue raspberry. The atmosphere is always great as well! They play great music and you can even watch them prepare your food.

    "text": "It's Taco Bell done right, open 24/7 and serving up them alcoholic drinks. There's only a few of these Taco Bell Cantinas around and only the cool cities have them :)  Really though it's just your typical Taco Bell food, nothing fancy. Don't remember if they bumped the prices up cause it's on the Strip. They have beer and frozen drinks (alcoholic or non). Soft drinks on tap. And you can buy Taco Bell merchandise.   After you order your name shows up on a list on the wall. Pay attention cause someone might jack your food, yes it happened.   The environment was loud and crowded with music and big screens. Seemed small with a few seats inside, outside, and upstairs. Upstairs there's just one restroom so you can imagine the wait. There's electrical outlets along the counters overlooking everyone if you need to charge something. At the time the stairs wasn't wide enough to fit my group and another group walking in the opposite direction but there is an elevator lol. Outside there's a fan for when it's hot and a heater for when it's cold. Yea that heater seemed on but didn't heat up anything we were right underneath it but there were electrical outlets maybe bring your own heater.",

If you're like me and was on the fence to go.  If you like Taco Bell but especially their drinks the it's worth a try. Not gonna say it's better than a Fat Tuesday. But a Baja Blast with rum is a nice alternative. And I recommend rum cause it doesn't ruin the drink with the taste of cheap alchy.",

There's a full menu (they also serve breakfast!) in addition to shareable plates. As with most things in Vegas, it's open 24 hours a day and serves alcohol (beer and shots that go into their freeze drinks). Yup, go ahead and have that Baja Blast Freeze plus a shot of vodka along with your chalupa.  I'm not gonna lie, the quality of our food was super fresh for fast food! There's an open kitchen so you can see how everything is being cooked, the speakers are blasting top 40s music, and there's several tables upstairs to eat. They also have merchandise as hats, shirts, souvenir cups, and etc.  The restaurant is located outside of Planet Hollywood, across from the Cosmopolitan hotel. Enjoy!",

Other than the chance to get a beer or alcoholic twisted freeze, the menu is the same as any other Taco Bell.

    "text": "We travelled down to the new Taco Bell Cantina to see what the talk was about and came back disappointed. First off, it's way small. Not much in the way of seating and..it might hold half to a third as many people as a regular TB. Price-wise we knew it would be higher but it was nearly $30.00 for two trim adults and a small child. Since we paid that much for the food, I didn't think it would be a problem to ask for some water cups. Nope. Your option is buy the pricey bottled water (of course it is). One of the biggest turnoff was the loud clubby music...it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night but you still had to almost yell to hear the other person speak. Of course the place is on the strip so getting their requires you to park at a casino and walk it...not really a fault of the restaurant. The food is in baskets but they make them less convenient to eat out of (in some cases) than the regular taco bell paper dishes so the novelty of the dollar store dinnerware wears off in about 5 seconds. They do have a \"gift shop\" but it's really just a couple of tshirts and a hat or two.   We do enjoy Taco Bell but this place functions more as brand building ad space than as a place to eat. If you like Taco Bell but wish it were much more expensive, much louder and with poorer seating options, I guess this would be the best place. If you are on the strip already and aren't interested in trying anything new or unique, this might also be a great option.   Oh and I forgot the location's claim to fame...it serves alcohol. I guess THAT makes it unique but certainly not a reason to make the drive",

Food is exactly the same as normal Taco Bells except with alcohol and overpriced merchandise. Price wise looks a little more expensive, I got the $5 meal box (the menu says limited time) so the price might only be for the grand opening, but it's on the strip so that's normal. Soda is on tap, same as normal fountain drinks but pours slower. Be careful topping off as they have a little burst when you first pull the the tap. Better food is available in the general area but if you want Taco Bell it's a neat little experience I suppose.",

Once upstairs, you realize this place was not well thought out. The whole place screams fire hazard as you are literally stepping over people's legs to get to a seat, I really felt like I was being pranked. The napkins and condiments were hidden away in some corner,  so we just ate without either of them because we didn't feel like crawling over people again. The music being played was annoyingly loud EDM, which I usually don't mind,  but when it's blaring like it was here, you can't help but want to get the hell out. I was so let down by this place because I am a HUGE Taco Bell fan. I wear my taco bell sweater with pride. Unfortunately,  I won't be returning and I recommend spending your time elsewhere.",

Not all places on the strip is cheap but Taco Bell always delivers.. especially this one in particular. I enjoyed the effort they put to make it fit well with the Vegas party scene.   Food came out quicker than most Taco Bell's so A+ on that.",

I do enjoy it but at the end of the day I always end up on the toilet (FaceSmack Emoji).   This is definitely one of the two visits this year for me. The best part about this Taco Bell is that it's located in Las Vegas and is a Cantina which means thy sell alcohol :) and they have a live DJ with club lights. Late night Taco Club LoL   Walking in the location definitely had a great live atmosphere. It had bright eye catching colors and lively welcoming music. It was still being a bit under construction but that didn't stop people from enjoying good comfort food and drinks. The place was packed, they offer indoor and outdoor seating. As I waited in line I got to talking to a couple of men about how awesome this place was to only find out they were the owners/investors (explained why they were in suites and ties) They gave me a bigger picture of the plans for the next couple of days and invited me to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor was still being worked on, but it will also offer seating and people will be able to order food and drinks as well. It was coming together nicely and I can see this place being non stop busy.   Don't forget to check out the second floor, merchandise is sold on both floors as well.   Enjoy your taco bell and drinks!",

    "text": "When I heard about Taco Bell Cantina selling alcoholic slushies, I was like, uh, hello, let's get to one p r o n t o. Turns out that this location was the first and is still one of the very few to actually serve alcoholic slushies, which is something that I didn't find out until many miles, conceding non-alcoholic slushies, and months later. So, yeah, just added it to the list of places to try on my next Vegas trip.   My visit to this Taco Bell Cantina (TBC) was in August of last year (2017), and I wasn't expecting much. A tourist trap, at best. I assumed the slushies would be watered down, and that the food would be average, if not sub-par. I assumed heckin' w r o n g.  We pulled up to the club after a long day of eating and a long night of drinking, the club being TBC. Although we spent literally every moment of the day where we weren't walking, eating, we were still hungry for some Taco Bell. Not too much Taco Bell, tho.  The first thing we (and probably everyone else, too) noticed was the wall of slushies behind the registers. Basically they have all of their regular slush options with various kinds of alcohol (rum, vodka, tequila, etc.) I don't care if you're 5, 95, or Mormon, your eyes shoot straight to this wall when you come in.  I got the Baja blast with whatever alcohol it came with, and my friend got the cherry one with whatever alcohol it came with (sorry, can't remember). They were good, totally not watered down, though overpriced for Taco Bell...though not overpriced for blended alcoholic beverages on the Las Vegas Strip.   We also settled on eating the naked chicken chips and the potato-rito. We had never had the chips before, but we had heard a lot about them and seen many advertisements. Honestly, they were overhyped. Not bad, just not anything to get excited about. The burrito was just average.  One of the cool things about this location, aside from it being on the friggen Vegas Strip, is that it has a patio-ish room where you can sit in open air and watch/interact with the Strip tourists. No, it's not advertised that way, but you create your own destiny.  Although the service wasn't anything special in terms of friendliness, I give this place four stars and remember the experience as a good one not just because I was drunk (and they provided me with more alcohol), but because the place was extremely clean and they were serving a high quantity of customers fairly quickly.   Will I return on my next trip to Las Vegas? If they are still selling those slushies, you bet.",

I really enjoyed the ambience - most of all, the alcohol..YUM!  The food is that of your average Taco Bell - tacos, quesadillas, burritos, etc. Delicious low cost food paired with alcohol, is a genius idea that took TB years to put into practice.  The reason for my low rating is they are not handicap friendly. The restroom is on the 2nd floor and they will not allow anyone to use the elevator. In a wheel chair or have trouble walking, I am the latter, too bad. Pee in your pants. One cashier asked her manager if I could use the elevator to use the restroom since I walk with a cane. The response was \"No\". This was the first time in my 4 years of using a cane that I was denied access to an elevator to use a restroom of an establishment where I was a paying customer. Completely unacceptable. I expect more from Taco Bell.",

I attempted to get my order corrected but was met with rude employees & several questions. We spent $29 & was treated like I was stealing. What a joke! Do not waste your time!!",

I ordered from a person because I was wasto and couldn't figure out the touch screen. The cantina has a full bar!! They fill their beers up from the bottom up, its magic.   Your name pops up on the big screen when your order is ready. My order was ready in 3 minutes at most. We went upstairs to the rooftop patio and it was poppin. They had a dj playing all the hits of the early 2000s. The patio overlooks the strip.  It's perfect for a late night munchie run after the clurb. Oh and best of all, it's open 24/7.

I wasn't expecting to be the biggest fan of this place but I made us go back the next day (sober) and it was still great. I love that there is a DJ and you can start to dance a little while ordering your food on the touchscreen. We didn't get any but they also serve alcohol here - ever wanted a boozey blue Mountain Dew slushie? This is the place. The food was a little bit better quality than the regular Taco Bell's I've been to, probably since they have so much traffic here. Everything was hot and came out quickly - the kitchen staff did a great job every time keeping up. I will come back here every time when I'm Vegas. Also, this is the place to bring international tourists to really experience the ultimate American fast food chain.",

Taco Bell is already like the go-to spot for drunk munchies (besides any Mexican spot with Carne Asada Fries) so of course it's bomb! It's cool how they have alcoholic frozen drinks like Margaritas and Pina Coladas plus beer on tap! The food menu is pretty much the same but maybe a bit more expensive. Weddings are on the menu as well for $600 if I remember correctly (hey it's Vegas right?!). There's also a bunch of TVs playing sports and a DJ mixing it up on the second floor.   Food was good and pretty much tastes the same as TBs elsewhere. The drinks were delicious but weak; couldn't taste the alcohol which could either be a good or dangerous thing. Not sure if it affected me personally as I was already a bit tipsy. The ambiance was cool tho and it's right on the strip (Planet Hollywood Hotel).   Dope Taco Bell to eat at at least once so check it out if you're ever in Vegas!",

They have different options for your base liquor between Skyy vodka, tequila, Jack Daniels whiskey, and Bacardi rum.  Overall it's pretty much the same as the Fat Tuesdays. The Fat Tuesdays might be more potent and bigger so you should probably just get those instead. The other cool thing is you can get married here if you're a Taco Bell enthusiast or super fan.",

Ordering time isn't too bad & the food comes out a decent pace which is surprising considering how busy this place gets.  Apart from the cool interior & the Taco Bell-brand daiquiris, there's really nothing special food-wise about this location. The daquiris themselves are a bit of a rip off in my opinion - $15 for barely a half yard & extra shots are an insane $5 extra per shot. You would get way more for your value if you ordered a Fat Tuesday next door at Miracle Mile.  The main reason I can see why you would come here is if you were drunk & wandering the strip & also had sudden craving for Taco Bell food, but since it's Vegas that scenario seems to be common for a lot of people, including me.",

I usually get a shredded chicken burrito, which I did this time and it was hands down the best one I've EVER had out of like 1,000+. The quality of the meat was different and you could tell it was really freshly made. It had the right amount of sauce and cheese vs it being more dry at the other Taco Bells I've been to.

    "text": "Finally got to try Taco Bell Cantina.  Our group decided to grab a bite as our dinner/late snack.   As you walk in, you can see the second floor above. You order first from a screen, and then wait till your order is ready for pick up. There is a alcohol slush options you can order while you're there. Their soda station is self serve and look like they are beer taps, which I found cool.   We ordered a variety of things and decided to eat upstairs. Luckily there was a DJ playing so there were music vibes. Along with the upstairs seating there is also a bar upstairs! From upstairs, you can see the various TV's that are either playing a sports game, the news, or music.   Did you forget some sauce and napkins? Have no worries, upstairs seating also has that for you.  I believe the only restroom in this Cantina is upstairs.  Of course I'll come back another food item along with a drink next time I'm in town",

I will definitely be returning!",

We got the large Baja Blast freeze with Bacardi, which included handy strap to carry around as we walked around outside. They also sell merchandise at this store, including t-shirts and shot glasses.   We got the Mexican pizza, the crunchwrap supreme, and the apple empanada. The food that we had was like any other Taco Bell chain, but they do have additional \"share plates\" at this location.   There was ample seating downstairs on the patio and additional tables upstairs, most with a pretty good view of the strip. The employees were very friendly and provided great customer service, especially for just being open a few days. Worth the visit if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

    "text": "Taco Bell + Alcohol = Dream come True  At least that's what it looked like on the video that was going around on facebook. Maybe I just over hyped it to myself. But it's not bad for what it is.  It's located on the side of Planet Hollywood, across from the Cosmo. Really easy to find. There is the typically menu here, plus some 'shareable' plates. at various valued prices. Got the bacon  potatoes and the jalapeno dippers. Really yummy and they were decent sized too!   So I thought there would be a DJ or something, I thought I saw that in the video, but maybe it was just for the grand opening? But it's just loud speakers playing top 40; at least when my party was there. The alcohol situation is limited to beer and/or a shot in their freezes. $5 for the add shot though. Comes in a souvenir container. The one my friend got wasn't mixed up all the way so you got all the vodka first than the freeze after.   VERY limited seating. The upstairs holds a one stall bathroom (!!!!) and about 6/7 tables and some bar stools. There's also seating in their outside patios, but if the heaters aren't on, than yall freezing!   I don't like that you don't get a tray to carry your food when they call your name. Also they don't check numbers/receipt, just on the good faith that its your name they called because there happened to be TWO other Vivian's there at the same time I was. My order was called first and they were arguing with Vivian #2l who said that wasn't what she ordered. I had to fight the crowds to get up there and tell them I am also Vivian! Also I ordered 3 different things cause I was splitting with my boyfriend, and they were like \"you ordered ALL these?!\" And I'm like yes I did. Manager, \"are you sure?\" Yes here's my receipt \"So you ordered all this??\" YES CHECK MY RECEIPT!  I don't think he believed me though =T So without a tray, I had to do a very delicate balancing act through all the people to get back to my table.   So if you were looking for some sorta cheap food on the strip, especially late at night, it's worth it. But it's definitely not as cool as it seemed on the facebook marketing video.",

    "text": "*DISCLAIMER*: This was a very drunk experience.  --LOCATION-- On the strip, near/ at Planet Hollywood. You can access the Taco Bell from the sidewalk. No need to go through the hotel.   --FOOD-- Same food as any other Taco Bell, although it seemed like a whole new world to me since I haven't stepped into one in ages.   Alcoholic slushees: Bomb. I got the Baja Blast with vodka. Other friends got the Baja Blast with tequila. You can taste the tequila more. The vodka one is way subtler, if not even noticeable. It's a little dangerous because it tastes like candy.   Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos: Pretty good. Dusty from the Dorito-ness powder.  Crunchwrap: Pretty darn good. Good amount of sauce and filling.   --EXPERIENCE-- Taco Bell did a good job. It's a brilliant idea since most people are going to be drunk AF and will get even drunker. Even if the food may have been the same as anywhere else, it pretty much is the perfect drunk experience. People with the munchies are going to go ham here.   --AESTHETICS-- It's nice a new. It is 2 stories and outside seating. The stairs leading upstairs is rather narrow. Outside seating is better and less claustrophobic. However, I went in the winter, so we went upstairs. If you're too drunk, the stairs may be a problem ):   Also, there's hella merchandise just sitting in front of the cash registers. This was disruptive and annoying. Line formation was a struggle. Overall too small and narrow for a popular spot.",

I walked across the strip and found Taco Bell Cantina around Planet Hollywood, located right next to McDonald's, ironically. However, despite the hype it is just Taco Bell at the end of the day - with the addition of alcoholic beverages.   You can expect it to be extremely crowded, although I can assume this will somewhat die down when the initial excitement wears off. There is seating upstairs and downstairs and after you wait in one of the lines that stretch across downstairs, orders are called out from the counter. For how busy it is, the orders don't take too long - but they did run out of every hot sauce except mild. The staff are all friendly and helpful, especially for dealing with all of the drunk people and such a consistent amount of orders. Nothing bad about it other than how busy it is - it just isn't as touristy as you would expect it to be. Convenient if you have some Taco Bell munchies and want an alcoholic slushy!",

Whether or not you think this is tacky, you have to admit it's a cool concept (Btw: I'm strictly reviewing the drinks here, I'll let you imagine how the food tastes and I guarantee you're spot on).  There is an array of frozen drinks you can chose from, flavors like blueberry, cherry, margarita, etc. etc. I didn't realize that the drinks already had alcohol in them, I just assumed you had to get one or two shots to get the party started (I asked for two).  Do I think it was worth $16? Kinda. I mean, when else am I going to get a freaking drink at Taco Bell? It's all good fun!  The drinks were strong, but mostly because I got those two shots. Both were sweet but not TOO sweet, I feel like these tasted a bit better than the Fat Tuesdays just because the amount of sugar they put in there drinks is astounding.  If you're looking to turn up I recommend asking for two, otherwise play it safe and get one.",

The food was good the DJ was on point we had a great time. I would love for them to bring one of these to Dallas!",

I love how this Taco Bell cantina is located in the middle of the trip, which makes it relatively easily accessible on the strip. I was a bit surprised at how small of a space it was inside compared to the huge sign they had on the building, but the lines move quick and there's some additional seating outside so no complaints here.   Since I just came from a buffet, all I wanted was some slushie booze. A regular cup is ~$10 and a yard container was ~$15. Definitely get the yard container :)   I had the cherry and the margarita flavors and both were delicious. So glad I got to come here and would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas with the late night munchies :)",

And let's be real. You only really crave Taco Bell when you're not in a total state of consciousness.  This Taco Bell Cantina is open 24/7 and yes, they do have alcoholic slushies. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices at this place seem to be on par with other Taco Bells. No price gouging for late night munchies here! The boyfriend and I shared a cravings box (shhh, don't tell my diet) that cost about $5, and we were both totally stuffed.  We didn't try their alcoholic slushies, but the reaction that I'm hearing is that there's not much alcohol taste.   There's some space to sit and chill on the second floor and also some outdoor patio area to hang around. Music is thumping here, so if you're not looking for another place where you have to yell to have a conversation, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "\"I spent $40 at Taco Bell\" --me when I got home from Vegas.  I gotta admit. I LOVE the TB. It's definitely my guilty pleasure. So when a friend told me about the Taco Bell on the Strip, I made it a point to stop by. The location is pretty central and easy to get to.  They offer the normal menu, but they also have an added small plate menu, which can only be found at these Cantinas. Of the small plates, we tried the 7 Layer Dip and the Spicy Ranch Smothered Potatoes. If you ever tried the potato loaded griller, it's the same potatoes. They tasted just like loaded potatoes and were delicious. The seven layer dip was similar to that of the kind you'd make at home, but they were chinsy with the chips. Of course we obliged in the $10 vodka Baja Blast freezes, which was what made the check so expensive.  Was it amazing? I don't know. The food tasted good and it was a fun experience. I wanted to buy a taco shirt, but my husband wouldn't let me. He's like \"are you really going to wear a Taco Bell shirt\" UM YEAH.",

You can mix and match the slushies and comes with your choice of hard liquor (tequila, whiskey, vodka, rum). According to the server, mixed in whiskey is gross, vodka and rum if you don't want to taste the alcohol, and tequila if you want a good kick to it (although this just made it taste like a margarita). I know they also have additional items on the menu but it's your typical Taco Bell type bar food, nothing extraordinary.  It's a two story building with seating up top as well as a small shaded patio out front. I guess the cool thing is that you can pick up Taco Bell merchandise here (i.e. shot glasses, shirts, hats).  Probably a place to check out only once if you're a Taco Bell fan.",

If you are as crazy about Taco Bell as me, then you now have a little fancier Taco Bell to hang out at.  DRINK: Have no fear, you can now enjoy your tacos with a nice beer. The beer here is really cool to watch them fill up. The beer cup is place on the dispenser and the beer will actually fill from the bottom up. A nice souvenir magnet is placed at the bottom of the cup to serve the beer. Even \"cooler,\" you can now get an array of Taco Bell Freezes with alcohol. Yes, Baja Blast with Bacardi is a thing! If you don't want alcohol, the freezes can be made virgin or you can get a drink from their unique sodas on tap fountain.  ATMOSPHERE: The counter where you order is where the magic happens. The freezes are in the Taco Bell sign behind the counter each representing a different letter. There is a sode blubbler above the counter that is mesmerizing to look at. They have Taco Bell merch in the place for you to show your Taco Bell spirit. There is seating outside on the patio or upstairs. They have large TVs so yes, you can eat Taco Bell, drink beer, and watch the game;)  Overall, it's not as special as everyone makes it. It's a little inconvenient to make your way here just for Taco Bell. It's a cool concept and definitely worth a try, but in the end, it's just eating Taco Bell food that you can get anywhere else.",

It's a fancier/flashier version of Taco Bell. Took a while to get our food and the place was a mess. I'm pretty sure the girls standing in line were shoplifting the Taco Bell merchandise, and security did not care who cut in line as long as they were decent looking. Saw many girls without their shoes but ah well, this is Taco Bell on the Las Vegas Strip; anything goes.  Come for the Taco Bell, people watching, and drinks if you care and dare but prepare yourself.",

We came here after we were at Marquee. It was freezing and made that made dash across the street!  This taco bell looks like a club.  There was actually a bouncer outside. It's got a really cool vibe and ambiance on the inside. It's two levels, but smaller than I had expected.  You order on the first floor and there's some seating on the second level.  It wasn't packed when we got there and didn't have to wait for that long.   The alcohol they serve is is slushy form and is not good. It was way too sweet and I love sweet. I was expecting this to be way better.   Overall, it's a cool place to check out.  Taco bell will always be taco bell and I love it. I was hoping for more booze wise though.",

    "text": "Taco Bell is my favorite Mexican fast-food and I was so excited to visit this Cantina location since I'm not from the area.   Came here on Saturday Night - technically Sunday morning around 4AM and had a not so great experience.   First off, when we entered, we were in awe with the decor and the menu! Loved the concept of a 24 hour location that serves alcohol and cool shirts/items.   However, like I mentioned, I will have to give this location a 2 star due to their horrible customer service. By far, the worst customer service and I've been to many Taco Bell's around California / West Coast.   When we entered, there was only one group of 3 people in front of us. They were directed to the touch screen machines since the registers were closed already. We followed them to the self-serve machines. There were about 5 machines and out of the 5, only 1 was actively working.   Unfortunately, the line started to get longer and longer. The group in front of us were not Americans and the crowd started to yell \"Do you know how to read English? Why are you taking so long... etc.\"   My friends and I decided to look at their screen and help them out. The machine was reading error every-time they placed their credit card. Therefore, I walked to the back and kindly asked the register if she could help the people in front of us. That way, everyone could be happy.   The Taco Bell worker rudely said \"Our register is closed.\" I understood that as soon as I walked in; however the line now had about 20 people out the door waiting for the one self-serve register machine. The worker then yelled \"When it's closed or broken then it's broken.\" So... what happens next?   I was shocked... so.... are you not going to address this to the line or refund the group in front of me or do anything? The worker ignored me and kept cleaning and counting her register. The co-worker next to her just stared at us and didn't do anything at all too.   I understand that Vegas May attract lots of drunk people and/or people who are hungry and impatient after the clubs and bars, but my friends and I were completely sober. We were hungry and were waiting to watch the sunset from out hotel room with Taco Bell before our flight out of Vegas.   Ended up leaving after 30 minutes and went a block over to give our business to Earl's Sandwich.   I love you Taco Bell, but this was by far the worst experience. Please find staff or security who can address broken registers and/or handle a rough crowd --especially when there are multiple witnesses giving other cultures a hard time/being racist. That is NOT ok!",

It was 3 am on a Sunday evening and there was a long wait. It took about 30 min to get our food. The tacos were a bit dry but it was acceptable food for a late night snack.",

When planning my trip to Vegas, visiting the Cantina was a must have.   Ambience I went to the Cantina Thursday Evening and there was a DJ there playing the best music. Every song reminded me of something my friends and I would play at a pregame and it really created a nice community vibe. Everyone was dancing in line and really enjoying themselves  Food and Drink I got the Twisted Baja Blast and it was amazing. I only got it with one shot, so it was not enough to make me drunk or tipsy, but tasted delicious and gave me a nice warm feeling  Overall, please go here! Even if you don't care about Taco Bell, but especially if you do.",

We ended up walking in the opposite direction and ended up walking all the way back to our hotel.  Thankfully, we tried our mission again the next night and it was so worth it.   Not only do they have awesome package deals that other Taco Bells don't have, but they also have alcohol.  They have a large variety of slushies with alcohol in them.  Everything is always so good and the pricing is so cheap.  The staff is normally fast and pretty nice.  I love the energy here!  The loud music and excitement makes it always a good time.

Came here after seeing the Backstreet Boys at Planet Hollywood (WHICH BY THE WAY WAS A KILLER SHOW, EVERYONE GO SEE THEM BEFORE THEIR RESIDENCY IN VEGAS ENDS!) while I was mildly turnt with my girl friends and it is the food meant for kings/queens.  All your great taco bell classics but beer and alcoholic drinks available. Their beer filler is this sick machine that fills the cup of beer from the BOTTOM. Turnt me kept trying to press the button on the bottom of my friend's beer cup because it was so intriguing (she yelled at me though and claims that if I press it all the beer will come out, not sure if this is True, someone please find this out for me and tell me).  It's open 24 hrs a day aka any time you have drunchies, and the DJ upstairs was killing it (I couldn't help dancing in my seat while I ate my chicken quesadilla).   Ample amount of roofed but outdoor seating, where you can people watch. Perfect summer breeze this past weekend, loud music. A short walk from a bunch of hotels on the strip. Legends say that when you put tequila in a baja blast, you can't even taste the tequila (DANGEROUS BUT WOAH). enjoy everyone, what a time to be alive.",

This weekend we visited Sin City(Las Vegas) to celebrate the wife's birthday. We had tons of recommendations, but one of them was made by one of my favorite Yelp Elites and also good friend Andy V, so I had to check this place out.  This Taco Bell is located right on the strip, across the street from The Cosmopolitan Hotel. The place looks super cool from outside, as is not your typical Taco Bell, this one has a bar inside and they sell yards of Baja Blasts with rum, or tequila, or if you really want a concussion you can have both lol. They have a dj playing music inside, a cool modern crazy decor and well the food is Taco Bell, but who cares when you are drinking $16 yards in Las Vegas( you known that's cheap)   So the wife and I each ordered one, and I cannot tell you about the rest. This place is super cool to visit and must definitely Chok approved",

    "text": "This place is A MESS. Thats the best way to put it. Came here around 4am after visiting XS nightclub.   1. When ordering the food I had to shout and could barely hear the questions the attendant was asking me because the music was just so damn loud. I understand thats what this place is about so I tried to overlook it but the noise became a problem again.  2. The pickup food area is a MESS. Not a single soul was able to hear their number being called so the counter area where you pickup food is CROWDED. I wanted to avoid this so I looked on their TV screens to see when my order was ready. My order showed as ready. so I went to the counter to pickup my order and this is when the REAL mess started   3. 1st, employees were just shouting out names and placing the orders on the counter without verifying the receipts and just went straight back to making the next orders and trying to avoid customer interaction AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I get it, youre busy but they created a bigger mess because now people were just taking what they thought was their order. As a result when I FINALLY showed the employee my receipt he said he had to remake it since someone else took it.   4. This employee then disappeared into the back and I stood there assuming my food was being remade. Waited around 20 mins just standing there and he straight up just disappeared. Meanwhile, my name is no longer showing on the screen because it must seem like my order was already taken care of. I ask another employee what the status of my order is only to have her roll her eyes at me and tell me they're just really busy and they'll work on it.   5. I wait another 10-15 mins. At this point there are SEVERAL people with order issues, or couldn't hear their order numbers and someone else took their orders etc so now theres about 8 of us just crowded in front of the counter. At this point, given common sense the manager or someone should have instructed the staff to take care of those remake orders FIRST before moving on to new orders. This did not happen. They just kept moving on to new orders therefore only intensifying the problem, making the area more crowded and overwhelming everyone in that area. Multiple bags of food just left on the counter with no owner because no one could hear a damn thing from the music blasting. At this point around 2-3 people got so fed up and went to the cashier to cancel/ask for refunds.   6. I waited another 5 mins holding in my frustration because I get it, theyre slammed but also theyre just making a bigger mess. They FINALLY call my name only to realize its a order for a different Kevin. I  told them I ordered ALOT more than this and I asked which order number this was for and the employee responded with \"we dont go by order numbers here, each employee takes care of their own orders so we go by name\" and I was just shocked.... like you dont go by order numbers? Why do you give order numbers out then? I was so confused because some of the bags had names + order numbers written on them and some just had names. So Im assuming its employee preference and not really standard operating procedure?   7. I FINALLY flagged someone down after ALL customers were ignored as much as possible. I asked her kindly, if she could please look into the status of my order. She took my receipt and said Ill make it now. she ended up making my order based off the receipt. At this point I was just ready to get out of there so I was relieved. She made my order, just tossed it to me with no \"here you go\" or \"sorry about the mixup/wait\" just straight up tossed the bag on the counter and tossed my receipt with it and turned right back around. I didnt even check to see if everything on my order was correct because honestly this place was a mess and after being there for almost 1 hour, I was ready to go back and sleep. mind you this was almost 5am at this point.   Overall, this was my 3/4th visit to Taco Bell Cantina but first time ordering to go at 4am. I will never go to this place again for late night eats in Vegas because its just WAYY to unorganized. Not to mention, the food prep/kitchen area was a MESS. Cheese in the lettuce containers, employees not changing out their gloves after touching surfaces that was probably not food prep friendly. The floor was littered with taco wrapper paper and ingredients etc.   Also, when it comes to customer service, this place could definitely use some retraining. The employees were giving attitude to customers who simply wanted to know the status of their order. For instance a guy asked should I go ask for a refund? or is my order being worked on? The female employee responded \"you can do whatever you want and it might be better for you to get a refund because we cant make your order right this second\" From her extremely agitated tone, I was shocked to say the least that that is what Taco Bell trains their employees to respond with.",

On a recommendation from my 20 something year old son and daughter we visited Taco Bell Cantina last night. This is a Taco Bell on the main strip of Las Vegas. The difference??  Two levels of seating, secret menu with multiple items, a soft drink menu that included slushees with alcohol, multiple tv monitors that displayed all sports events, and a disc jockey playing modern hip hop music at incredibly high volume levels.   My family elected a dinner of nachos bell grandes, tacos, burritos, enchiritos, taco fries, and chalupas. We had slushees with jack daniels and ate listening to artists like Pit Bull, Sean Paul, T Pain and Migos. Not that I know ANY of these people but my kids seemed to be fully aware of their songs.   Overall it was a fun and unique experience, one catered to the younger crowd but I still enjoyed it. Not a lot of expectations for the food other than your standard fast food flavors and selection.",

It's got two floors, a DJ, alcoholic slushies, an open kitchen, and some exclusive menu items. The food items are the same prices as any taco bell. I got the jalapeno dippers, a quesarito, and a \"twisted\" baja blast with rum. The frozen drinks flavors were blue raspberry, pina colada, \"frose\", cherry, margarita, Pepsi, and baja blast. You could get them with rum, tequila, whiskey, or vodka. They had basic and top shelf at different prices. The yard comes with 2 shots of basic alcohol for 15 dollars. You can add a shot for 5 dollars. They dont do refills (but lifehack: the sugar factory right next door in the miracle miles does 10 dollar refills on the yards with their own drinks). They do have a normal bar on the second floor too. They had a lot of TV screens playing sports and movies.  My food and drink came out within 5 minutes. They forgot about my friends order though and she had to wait like 15 minutes for some cinnamon bites and her pina colada. They gave her extra as an apology but still. Overall it was an interesting experience. This location is like a taco bell crossed with a club and a sports bar. I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this particular location again though.",

    "text": "On the strip, a Taco Bell with cool music and a bar!  It could easily be brought up a star but for the poor, frenetic service at the main counter. They have many of your Taco Bell favorites, with the addition of smoothies, either virgin or with alcohol. Pay for an extra shot, and they happily give you \"half\" a shot, as evidenced by a three count poor, so stick with the normal one, or skip altogether. My son, who is 19, was asked if he wanted his with booze or without. No carding? They were busy and quite flustered at the time, but really could use some real management help.  Upstairs there is more seating, and a full regular bar that you would never know is there unless you went up. Taco Bell is a good place for a quick bite that you may be comfortable with, all while saving some dough compared to every other place on the strip.",

    "text": "This is my favorite Taco Bell I have ever been to!   My first visit was a late night feast with my bachelorette party last year. Granted we were not the typical bachelorette party. It was my 2 bffs and all of our moms. It was pretty packed, but one of the moms was able to secure a table in the outside patio area while the rest of us placed our food orders. Maybe it was the booze talking, but everything was hot and tasted fresh! They had a live DJ upstairs and the music was keeping everyone hype.   A couple weeks ago I found myself in Vegas again and knew I wanted to come back here. I came out of the Magic Mike show at the Hard Rock feeling good and grabbed a Lyft over to Taco Bell. It wasn't as crowded as last time but they still had their late night DJ blasting music. I also noticed the merch rack that used to be in the middle of the store is gone, and that there were just a few items left displayed on the wall. But I wasn't there for clothes, I needed FOOD. I ordered nacho fries supreme, a quesadilla, a taco and a boozy slushie. Everything was just perfection again! Food came out quickly and for as busy as the place can get, the restaurant was clean and well managed with friendly employees.  On my last day in Vegas I wanted to stop by one last time. It was right after a heavy lunch, but I still grabbed a boozy tequila slushie for $10.  Ohh, Taco Bell Cantina, you remain one of my favorite spots in Vegas.",

The lines were unorganized and the DJ on the second floor was so loud that I could barely hear myself think. I ended up ordering a drink through the kiosk and once it was placed, my name went up on a screen that showed they were working on it.   I waited until I saw that it was ready but I didn't know that there is a separate pick up area for food and drinks. I had bought a drink with alcohol in it and apparently, you have to pick it up at the front where the registers are. There is no pickup area so I ended up standing in line where they still had to make it. If you add a shot to your drink, you'll be waiting a little longer because of the process.  Overall, if you want food, by all means, come here. If you want a drink, consider Fat Tuesday.",

Arrived and realized it was tiny and overhyped - it's just a glorified Taco Bell done up Vegas style that serves alcoholic mixed drinks.  Bf and I walked in, looked around, said to each other \"that's it?!\", then left to go eat/hang out somewhere else.  The place is decorated in lounge style, dim with colored lights, music booming loudly. Have to admit it looked kind of cool.  Size wise, it's tinyyyy. Literally like, a little corner shop tucked away on strip. We walked by and missed it the first time. It gets crowded lining up waiting to order, merchandise stands take up space. Cramped seating both inside and outside.  Nothing really special here, save your time in Vegas and go somewhere more unique and fun!   Bf and I love Taco Bell, but we weren't too impressed. Won't be back!",

    "text": "IT'S A TACO BELL WITH ALCOHOL AND HIP HOP! What is not to like?  This place was a lifesaver in Vegas as it allowed us to save so much on food when we were running over budget at the end of our trip. Heineken was under $6. A cravings deal was $5.99. We could get a complete and delicious meal, er, maybe not complete, but completely delicious, for about $15-$20 per person, including a beer.   They were blasting hip hop on the top floor where we sat on one visit. They also had some tvs showing various sporting competitions. On our next visit, we sat on the little outdoor patio. The seating here was a little cramped, but it made for great people watching of folks walking the Strip.  You can also get married here for very little $. The wedding in package includes a bunch of tacos and a hot sauce garter belt!   Staff was friendly on all our visits and I was very pleased when a chick agreed to serve me a beer even though I didn't have my license- had left it in a different bag at the hotel. I am so obviously over 21- I even showed her my grey hairs- so this was much appreciated!   They take cards. It was happy. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip!  Go here, eat tacos, drink beer!  Oh, they fill the beer from the bottom of the glass and then plug it with magnet. Don't remove the magnet or you will lose your beer! The magnet does make a great souvenir to bring home and throw on your fridge to remind you of the awesome time you had at this Taco Bell Cantina.",

Though I was admittedly hesitant, I actually thoroughly enjoyed them, especially with their yummy nacho cheese dip. I always add in hot sauce to their cheese to add a bit of spice. I got their $5 cravings deal which is honestly such a steal, including a burrito, gordita, taco, nachos, and a drink! I also got a pepsi slushie (not with alcohol) which was amazing, especially amidst the Vegas heat. Everything was so good!  But what really makes this Taco Bell is the environment. With the DJ upstairs, the fun decor, the shining lights, the aura was amazing. It is definitely a place where you can jam to and just have a ton of fun without having to be 21 or having to be drunk. This is the place to go in Vegas in my opinion. Also the DJ that was there when I went was absolutely killing the game.",

Service: They have a dope board that displays your name and when your good is ready- can you say helpful when you're boozed up?   Atmosphere: AT NIGHT - if they had a dance floor I'm pretty sure I would have been twerking. Correction- I am sure that I would have been twerking. The music is LIVE and the cool retro lights make it even more fun!  Not a fan of: The \"dining\" area is small so there isn't a lot of seating.",

This made it hard for us to ask questions about the drinks so we just ended up getting the same one that we got last time - mountain dew baja blast. It was a bit watery this time compared to last time but it tasted pretty much the same. The workers aren't that enthusiastic but I can tell that they're trying - everything is super loud all the time and it's super crowded at peak hours and half the people are drunk. We got our food within 15-20 minutes so it wasn't too bad considering they were pretty packed. The food tastes like any other taco bell, it's nothing special unless you get an alcoholic drink.",

The service was quick. They have a screen that displays all the orders and the order they are completing them in. A must-try are their frozen alcoholic drinks, they range from margaritas to pina coladas to Baja Blasts, and you can pick the type of alcohol you want. I got a Baja Blast with tequila. It's seriously a dream.   I recommend sitting either outside by the misters or upstairs by the DJ ;) I swear, this guy is mixing music at all times of the day like it's a nightclub. I've never seen a Taco Bell this bangin'.    Bathrooms are upstairs too. The restaurant is smaller than it looks like in the pictures but it gets the job done. Two thumbs up from me!

You walk in, greeted by a wall of Freeze.  Plenty of different flavors, alcohol mixed in if you would like as well.  You can buy Taco Bell merchandise, shirts, swimsuits, and other items for the True Taco Bell fan.  Music is pumping fairly loudly the entire time due to the DJ upstairs.  While that makes it a little hard to hear, it's unique and fun.  The menu is the same as it is everywhere, as far as I could tell.  Prices are too.  I went with a $5 BIG BOX.  That included a normal taco, Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Burrito Supreme, nachos, and a drink.  I had them sub the drink for a Baja Blast Freeze.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure what that did to the overall price, but it wasn't much.  Then you get to wait for your food, listening to the music and browsing the merchandise.  You can also look through the window to the kitchen and watch people make your food five feet and a glass panel away from you.  This was actually pretty interesting and fun to see.  You can see your name on the order screen and watch it make its way up the the line until they start making it.    The food was Taco Bell.  We ate upstairs and enjoyed the people watching from on high.  It was also around 1 AM.  These guys are open 24 hours a day, which is perfect for a late night meal after being out late.  I will definitely come back and don't care if the people with me don't want Taco Bell.",

Underwhelming   It was just like any other Taco Bell menu wise except 3 items they only sell. Yes there's alcoholic drinks but I made mine better by adding a good amount with the mini bottles I had.  The merch online seemed like a store and it's just a small shelving unit once you walk in.  Employees were nice in answering my questions but we did lunch before the rush came so they weren't swamped yet.  As for music it's um...\"interesting\" to say the least. As in hop you like bad hip hop.   Basically if your a Taco Bell fan or just want food it's on a great location.

    "text": "Alright, if you think, this is just a regular taco bell, let me tell you girl are you wrong! We literally dressed up fancy just to come here and take a photo! (see photo I uplaoded)  This is probably one of the fanciest Taco Bell I have ever experienced! (Which doesn't say much because I am not really a Taco Bell fan but still).  Before going in, already there is a giant vegas appropreiate giant logo on the outside lit up saying taco bell. They have DJ upstairs blasting music, multiple TV screens showing all different sports, and lots of fancy seating areas.   The store is a bit small compare to the population that comes around. They have security around, and they sell booze! We ubered here to try their Baja Blast, which I guess was super hyped up. It tasted like 7-11 slushee mixed with alcohol of your choice. They have rum, tequila, etc etc. I tried toe one with rum and the one with tequila. They both tasted alright, I'd give it a 3/5. I would still say fat tuesdays are way better.   This place is pretty clean compare to many of the places on the strip, esp fast food wise. They have soft couch seats, and fancy bar looking tables. Music playing all night long. Second floor is super loud, its where the speakers are and the DJ, so if you want more of a conversation, I highly recommend downstairs.   This taco bell is more of a place for experience I fell than anything else. It's  different atmosphere, and a must try!",

    "text": "Changing the Taco game.   The Taco Bell Cantina is your average Taco Bell with some added Vegas personality! While the menu items are the same, this spinoff is largely known for its alcoholic beverages and Vegas vibes.   The Cantina includes two floors and a patio - which is the perfect spot for people watching along the strip! You can purchase both food and beverage at the first floor bar, and they also offer multiple kiosks for customers to expedite the ordering process.   Upstairs is a ton of additional seating, as well as a DJ and dance floor to get the party started!   While I dig the added cocktails, I'd love to see the Cantina offer a few exclusive items outside of the traditional menu. I was also bummed that you can't order a water cup, even with a purchase.",

    "text": "After a trek under the blazing hot sun, the perfect way to cool down in Vegas is with a Baja Blast with Tequila. Hands down our favorite drink over the weekend.   TBC is the upgraded version of a regular Taco Bell. It has similar menu with upgraded touch screens to order. They even sold merch inside the store. The place could sit a couple of people inside and upstairs. They also host wedding events! While dining, one of the staff did turn the sign around for private event, so I assumed that people did get married there.   Overall, the food is the same as other Taco Bell. We loved our Baja blast. Unfortunately, this location does not offer water cups, but rather sells water bottles. We even paid for $2+ for a cup just to put ice (no they were not covered in gold). A one and done destination, but I'd probably send someone for a Baja blast!",

It's the same great taco bell taste, with the Vegas lights, Vegas booze, and Vegas fun. They have just about everything you could imagine, and more. This Taco Bell Cantina location also has a killer playlist bumping, yard long frozen adult beverages, and a wedding chapel and event space upstairs?!  You can't tell me that the ultimate wedding goals isn't getting eloped with an Elvis impersonator as the officiant, inside of a Taco Bell. And then celebrating with locos tacos and vodka spike baja blasts.",

I ordered the cheesy bean and rice burrito and a regular sized margarita with tequila (they also have the choice of vodka so you can choose between those two options). Both the burrito and drink were amazing!   It was especially nice to be able to go upstairs and beat the heat while witnessing a Taco Bell wedding! Can you live mas? I later found out Taco Bell weddings are a real thing and they have 3 scheduled for that day!   I believe this is a great place to check out if in the area because it is nothing like your average Taco Bell back home. Come for the Baja blast with vodka, the Coca-Cola slush with captain Morgan, blue raspberry slush with vodka, or their other options! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I know it's a corporate business but this was too unique and highly raved by my drunk friends that visit this place. Here was my experience on a early Friday night.  AMBIANCE: Parking: It's The Strip sooo parking structure or afar plaza parking...good luck.  Seating: Room for about 50 people, bar seating or group table seating.  Feels:  It's the Las Vegas Strip so there are a lot of things to do and see here. As for the lounge itself, it's like no other Taco Bell. A vibrant spot with room to chill, eat and dance. They have a live DJ playing all the popping beats old and new. There's also a few tvs if you want to catch up on sport scores.  FOOD: Chicken Quesadilla (Recommend) It was something cheap and easy to carry. Pretty cheesy and meat well scattered.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Pretty chill. No complaints here  TL; DR OVERALL: 4 Stars. It's an experience indeed with a reasonable price. If you're not close to a Fat Tuesdays, there slushies seem pretty nice and if you're hungry, this can be your drunken fix.  TIPS: * Great place for late night drinks * You can also order via their in-store machine. * No outside drinks.",

It's a Taco Bell, but it's more like a club. Bright colors, a DJ, two levels. It's awesome!  And the drinks! Oh man, the drinks are amazing! I got a frozen Baja Blast with rum and it was delicious. And dangerous! You couldn't taste the alcohol at all, but it was definitely in there (and I paid for an extra shot).   If you're in Vegas and you like Taco Bell you have to check out Taco Bell Cantina! I'll definitely be returning on my next Vegas trip!",

The inside of the Taco Bell Cantina is so cool! It's hard to explain unless you've actually been there/since it, so pls, just go for yourself!   The ability to add Bacardi/Skyy Vodka/Hornitos to a Baja Blast is just exactly what Vegas is intended for. We got a 32 ounce Baja Blast with vodka and we were in looove.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but back home in Washington they don't have the Spicy Potato Burrito on the menu. I saw that and HAD to try it. So glad I did, because it's probably one of my favorite new menu items. It's definitely got a kick to it and the potatoes are perfectly crispy, topped with some melty cheese and lettuce. F*** me upppp.  The prices here are comparable to any other Taco Bell for food, but the drinks will cost you a pretty penny - as if that's not the norm in Vegas.",

Tends to get very busy but fastest way to get your food is via the automated kiosks.   Taco Bell has a plethora of special foods these days from Doritos tacos to French fry based \"rattlesnake\" burritos and nachos.  You can't always figure out what exactly will be in each item (we ordered nachos - one time it had jalapenos the next time no jalapenos but sour cream instead) but during an extended stay across the street at the Cosmopolitan we'd occasionally bring take out food from here up to the suite for lunch, and it all tasted good.   I rate it four stars among fast food joints for consistency and variety of menu.  At least what you get ends up looking more or less like the picture on the Taco Bell menu versus say McDonald's where the misshapen flattened burger you get doesn't resemble the menu pic whatsoever.",

You'll probably be struck first by the deafening club music and the DJ on the second floor.  Or maybe the gigantic (adult) drink station.  I wasn't sure how I'd react, reading reviews before stepping into this place but pretty soon I was unknowingly swaying my hips and bumping club music while waiting to order my crunchwrap supreme. It's cool and it's fun and funny and ridiculous all at once.  The food is about the same price as regular Taco Bell - with regular Vegas markups.  Maybe add $1-$3 extra to your meal.  Sounds tacky and maybe I was caught up in the moment, but the food tastes like it's actually kind of been prepared with care?  There's certainly a ceiling on how good the food can actually taste as it's still fast 'mexican' food, but still, pleasantly surprised.  The drinks are Fat Tuesday prices but just, somehow, cooler.  I'd highly recommend the Pina Colada with two shots of tequila.   Instead of checking out all the other typical fast food joints nearby, be cool and try this place!

I ordered the nacho fries box, which comes with a drink, nacho fries, a Doritos loco taco, and a 5 layer burrito. I ordered the burrito with no sour cream, which was on the receipt and they still put sour cream. I had to do my best to squeeze it out because by the tome I got to eat my burrito, I had already gone to them for two other mishaps. For one, they forgot to give me my taco and two, they put onion in my little sister's burrito even though we ordered that without onions. The guy I had to talk to at the counter where you pick up your order was so rude about it. Both times I approached as nicely as possible, because things happen, but he didn't even look at me or say anything. He just took my items and then gave me the correct thing. I'm glad he at least did that. Later on, I noticed that several people were going up to The counter after receiving wrong orders:",

They have these screens where you can order your food and did I mention they have a bar!!!! Yes, a bar!!!! You can order those cool collector plastic bottles where you can fill it with your favorite margarita. The beer is put into a cup with a magnet underneath that you can keep as a souvenir.   The menu is pretty much the same as back home so I hope they incorporate some secret menu items for this location if they don't already. We will def be back!",

Our food took a minute but came out hot and everything actually tasted fresh compared to the usual Taco Bell.   They even serve alcohol and have self serve tablets so you can order quickly. It was a good experience.   Having music and large TVs upstairs made the experience better. The drinks are cheaper compared to some of the strip.",

Not to mention that it was 104-107 throughout the day I went here.   The inside is clean, and very cool. I ended up getting a Margarita flavored Freeze with Tequila and a Beefy Frito Burrito. The Freeze was extremely refreshing and the Burrito was full of flavor. Did I mention that they have 2 stories? Upstairs had AC and giant TVs and a view of the strip.   This place was so good that I ended up going AGIAN the same night and got a Blue Raspberry Freeze with Tequila.   I don't know if I can ever get a Freeze from a regular Taco Bell again.",

Only a few were in service. They have a unique way of pouring draft drinks. Food is average. It seemed a bit disorganized but no major complaints. The music was great but a bit too loud. I didn't know they had a live DJ playing music up until we went upstairs. The upstairs section provides more seating and a view of the DJ. They also have TV's located upstairs which lets you see parts of the restaurant, including the DJ and some regular TV as well.  Come by and check it out!",

Came here with my travel companions aka college friends after our day long trek through the Vegas streets and had a really fun time.  Basically this is a regular Taco Bell with a bar/lounge like feel offering typical menu items BUT alcohol additives to the drink options. You can choose from 4 different types of liquor to add to your drink of choice and it will be blended into a delicious slushie to your liking.  Also, this Taco Bell is open 24 hrs and has a DJ on the upper deck playing a variety of different hits and genres. This was a really unique Taco Bell and hey who doesn't like alcohol with their Mountain Dew Baja Blast and some good music too?!  Check it out y'all! It won't disappoint.",

I usually stick with the baja blast flavor and you can get the alcohol mixed in if you want! The food is always good as well.

After 4 of us ordered food at the kiosk, we went and sat down to wait. 2 of my friends received their food in about 5 minutes. Me and my other friend continued to wait. After about 40 minutes we began to get extremely frustrated. We walked up the counter to see what was going on. Once we were up there we realized that there were others having the same problem. We ask the women who was expediting the food where our order was and she very flustered and seemed lost. We explained to her the problem and what we ordered. Instead of just making our food and the others who had been waiting about an hour at this point she continued to just work on the other orders. She told us our orders were coming from the back. Another 15 minutes and still no food, she then tried to explain that there were a lot of orders coming in but that would not create a 45 minute discrepancy between me and my friends. Her lack of trying to fix the problem was disappointing and I was ready for a refund. I FINALLY got my food but I doubt I'll be visit Taco Bell again.",

I order the new double stacked tacos and it is probably the first time in my life where the item looked darn close to the picture. Taste wise, I couldn't really tell because I just needed food in my stomach. They had a bunch of alcoholic slushies which I didn't get to try but will get next time.   The restaurant has a very nice layout with outdoor seating and an upstairs. I was too messed up to get upstairs. So I just enjoyed the downstairs part. I love the soda station because it looks like the machines that dispenses beer but with all wooden handles.   The only knock is that the music is WAY TOO LOUD. It's very hard to talk even in the open door area. Never had I had to yell at the cashier to tell her what I wanted. I was exhausted from tell her my specifics so I just said ONE OF EACH FROM THAT MENU. Aside from that, this place is awesome and wish there was more like it everywhere else.",

It's pretty much your standard Taco Bell, just with merchandise and alcohol.   There's a variety of drinks you can choose from and then you choose your alcohol: Vodka, Tequila, Rum or something else I can't remember :)  I decided on a Cherry Icee with 2 shots of vodka. It was glorious. Along side my crunch-wrap, it was pretty much the best taco bell dinner I've ever had.",

The decor is also fun - followed the sign \"Let's Take this Party Upstairs\"; went up the stairs to the second level where it was dark and found a group of younger kids hanging out - kind of like a poor man nightclub at that point.  There's also a patio with heaters if you want it slightly quieter.  The menu is the same as any other Taco Bell, the service is the same.",

For whatever reason, this Taco Bell doesn't live up to par as the ones back near my home. The proportions are a lot smaller and the soft drink bar makes you feel like you're in the old Wild West. Service wasn't great either because the lady behind the cash register made it seem like she hated her job. When we asked what alcohol shots go with the Baja blast, the lady couldn't tell us because she \"didn't know.\" She also didn't know how to have the right alcohol to Baja Blast ratio because when we got our $10 regular sized drink, it ended up tasting like straight tequila with no sort of Baja Blast remnants. We'll most likely stick to Fat Tuesdays if we want a alcoholic slushie drink.",

He was 16 at the time and he felt like an absolute \"cool boy\", by staying out late on the strip and walking into the Cantina while the music was blasting. Food is regular, but that's not really what you pay for when you come here. It's the atmosphere. PLUS, alcoholic taco bell slushies, man!  I think we stayed for a good 1.5 hours, and half of that was just finishing our slushies and listening to the DJ play. My cousin loved it and so did I.",

However, living in Southern California for the last 14 years, Del Taco has started to creep up and take over... mostly as drunk food, and mostly the Quesadilla... so that is why I YELP'd Del Taco, and found Taco Bell Cantina Instead.  Generally speaking, 24 hour Taco Bell.  Prices similar to off strip, and they serve Frozen Alcoholic beverages.  DJ Spins music upstairs, and the place is packed. Those workers are mad efficient too, they just be cranking out orders non-stop!  What more do you need to know?  Damn that music is loud too... people should just party here.  Beware the cameras upstairs, that display you on the big screen that everyone in the restaurant can see. So don't pass out, and don't do anything you don't want other people to see. LMAO.",

When we told the workers that the food tasted strange, they told us that other customers returned a 10 or 12 value back of tacos today!  I feel that they should have looked into this situation before selling more tacos or tostadas. The issue is basically the taco shells. Even the taco shell on my friend's tostada did not taste good. I hope we do not get sick from eating here!  Overall we were disappointed. The restroom was disgusting as well.",

It's nice on the outside-has outdoor seating for the warmer temps or for those who just want to be outside. When you walk in, you are immediately immersed in THE loudest music you will ever hear. Being in a club was quieter than that music. I had to yell at the cashier so they could hear my order. There were some merchandise racks that you could buy Taco Bell shirts, etc. A cool option at this place is alcoholic freezes, which are moderately expensive but not bad for Vegas price. The food itself is relatively cheap-I got two quesadillas and a medium drink for $11...and it was super good. There's an upstairs area with different seating arrangements and a live DJ. Overall it was definitely worth going to, but the only complaint is that the music was too loud!",

    "text": "24/7 Taco Bell with alcohol? Is this real life??? When in Vegas, you just have to come here because where else in the country can you get Taco Bell and alcohol at the same time ! I was super keen on coming here after seeing so many videos of it on Facebook and honestly I thought it was worth it.  Obviously the food is literally exactly the same that you would get in a normal taco bell and there's nothing special about it. But why change the food? That's exactly the food I go to taco bell for. If you change the food, it's no longer taco bell.   Inside there are these really cool lights and bubbly lit tubes going down on the menu over the cash registers. It's full of cool lights and there's a bunch of seating both inside and outside. It's basically a flashier version of Taco Bell that you would expect to see in Vegas. If you're a True taco bell fan, you can even buy souvenirs inside. The biggest con is the amount of people here and the line felt incredibly slow moving.   As far as the alcohol, you can pick from beer, wine, or the freezes which is basically the taco bell slushies with alcohol mixed in them. I would totally recommend the freezes since beer and wine you can get anywhere else. The baja blast freeze with bacardi was worth every ounce of sugar.   All in all, it's taco bell with alcohol so don't expect anything more then that. Not really sure why there are so many negative reviews of people having higher expectations. But to me, that combination alone totally makes it worth a visit and it's something you just have to experience when in Vegas even if it's just for the snapchat. The fact that it's open 24/7 makes it the prime spot to go to after a long night of clubbing and I highly recommend.",

Also, they're not shady with their alcohol content! They'll make it as strong as you like and if you're crazy enough, you can even choose all the liquor you want!

Better than say contemporary DJs like Calvin Harris. But that's because Calvin Harris quite simply isn't that good. I digress, but people started dancing in the Taco Bell lobby. That's impressive. Also everyone got a shout-out.  Don't go on a date unless your date is legally deaf, or if your date is Calvin Harris. I had a doubledilla and it eh pretty ok I guess.  6.5/10 would recommend",

    "text": "Okay so being a local and after seeing all the hype I had to try this place out. I honestly never thought I'd give a review for a Taco Bell since you pretty much know what you're getting when you go to Taco Bell. Taco Bell is pretty straight forward but like I said with all the hype I had to try this place out.   So the selling point of this place for me isn't even how futuristic and cool it looks. It's actually the price which for a college student like me is a great thing, I ate a nice meal, drink, and got a freeze for 10 bucks.   The food was also surprisingly delicious and well made. It did not taste like fast food at all and was really good for such a decent price. The only time this restaurant does get expensive is with the \"twisted\" freezes which is basically just a shot of alcohol into whatever flavor of freeze you want. The prices for the Twisted Freezes are very touristy and truth be told for what you get it's not worth it to me. The alcohol choices for your \"twisted\" freeze is kind of limited. It's basically vodka, rum, or tequila and it's really generic stuff like Bacardi.    They do have a ton of freeze flavors which I really like including some old classics like Baja Blast along with the new ones and the freezes are pretty cheap around 4 bucks (without alcohol). The biggest letdown to the Cantina though is actually the size, now it's not enough to warrant a star deduction but the place is small. It doesn't have downstairs indoor seating at all, the downstairs seating is actually on a patio outside which is heated and cooled though. The upstairs seating is really nice with plush chairs and booths along with massive flat screen tvs but the seating upstairs is limited. If the place is packed good luck getting a seat especially if you have a group with you.   All in all I really love the Taco Bell Cantina and will definitely be back especially if i'm on the strip. It's a nice and cheap place for locals and tourists to eat without breaking the bank and it's got a great atmosphere. The bubbling freeze tanks make me feel i'm in a cantina in a galaxy far far away which I really like and the plush seating upstairs is sick. I really love it and the food is really tasty, Taco Bell stepped up their game with their flagship restaurant.",

Continued to tell me I need to grab my food and leave immediately. Then told the security guard to stand next to me to make sure I left. Then went to the people making the food to tell them to rush. I did and said nothing to be treated this way. Never coming back. Super rude",

It was most likely from the meat because our other friend was fine and the only thing she didn't eat was the meat.   We were extremely ill and this caused us to miss out on our seminar for work. Why is that fact important? Because we paid hundreds of dollars to attend this seminar and whoever contacted me when I just wanted to share my experience so that they were aware and could take better measures to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else, wanted to insult me by offering me a refund of $12! NOT WHAT I WANTED AT ALL. A simple apology and being told they would follow up with the location and make sure food is being prepped and cooked properly is all that was needed. My friend also sent in her experience but no one contacted her. Clearly they also need to work on their customer service.   Side note: We were not drunk nor were we drinking so that's not why we were sick.",

    "text": "Yo if you love Taco Bell as much as I do, then this is A MUST for every Vegas trip!  First of all, the cantina is way more hyped on the commercials than it actually is. The cantina is really just a small shop with limited patio seating. However, it makes up for it with the retail and *alcoholic* beverage options.  RETAIL If you so choose, you can purchase taco trunks, taco bikinis, Taco Bell beach towels, sweaters, hats, and more. The pricing is pretty steep, about $30+ depending on what you get. The shot glasses themselves are $10 each but come in a cute variety of colors. I didn't end up buying anything this time but who knows, maybe I just might later on.   FOOD You'll get your typical Taco Bell menu here. From what I remember, their dollar menu doesn't exist here but I could be wrong.   DRINKS This is where the fun begins. To start, their soda fountains are made to look like beer taps. How adorable! Next, they have a much wider range of alcoholic freezes to choose from. Their ever so popular Mountain Dew Baja blast comes as a non-alcoholic and alcoholic option: if you choose the adult version you can get it in a regular size ($10), a yard size ($15--worth it considering size), with your choice of 1800 tequila, Captain Morgan rum, and Skyy Vodka. Any additional shots will cost you $2.  Overall, I enjoyed coming here and do plan on coming back. I didn't get to see if they had a refill option for the yard cups and I know that very few places that sell similar drinks will likely refill it, but you can always try out for yourself.",

The 2 story Cantina has alcoholic Baja Blasts, good music depending on who your DJ is, happy, dancing workers taking your order, and of course, the deliciousness of Taco Bell.  Food: prices will of course be a bit more than your local Taco Bell but you can't get the alcoholic Baja Blasts anywhere else! There's different flavors and you can pick from tequila, vodka, rum or whiskey.  Seating: there's outdoor seating on the first floor but if you take the stairs to the 2nd floor, you could eat and people watch or watch whatever they put on the big screen up top. If you forgot your hot sauces after you get your order, don't worry! There's a hot sauce area upstairs as well.  Ordering: after you order, you wait for your name to be called. If you're upstairs, there's a digital screen that'll let you know if your food is ready. You can watch your food being made through the giant glass screen as well.",

    "text": "3.5 stars for pretty good  In the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Taco Bell Cantina is the soul of the new Taco. Opened in the same time frame of the Taco Bell logo refresh on November 14, 2016; this has the honor of being the first flagship Taco Bell in addition to being the first Taco Bell with a gift shop. This is Taco Bell's CMO Maria Thalberg's take on the first flagship Taco Bell,  \"This flagship restaurant is our ultimate expression of the Taco Bell brand, and lifestyle.\"  The way I see it, the first flagship Taco Bell is likewise the ultimate expression of the Las Vegas brand, and lifestyle. First off, it serves booze. Second off it is open 24/7. Third, it is large and modern. If I am not mistaken this is one of the few if not the only two-floor Taco Bell. In Las Vegas style, it incorporates a VIP lounge and DJ booth. And in millennium fashion, it incorpatrs the aspects of a modern restaurant. Fronting the restaurant, which by the way is formerly a pizza place, is a patio. The patio is equipped with misters for cooling off in the brutal summer weather, coverings, and LED lighting. In addition to outside patio seating the second-floor mezzanine has sufficient seating overlooking a 16 screen television system. Below the mezzanine and in back of the patio is the modern lobby that includes the gift shop, open kitchen, and order counter with digital menu boards.  Taco Bell has a reputation as hangover food. However at the flagship Taco Bell, customers can drink alcohol prior to the hangover. This Taco Bell is all about drinking and eating. In reality it is a Taco Bell Cantina. In addition to being the first flagship and 7,000th Taco Bell, it is the fourth Taco Bell Cantina. Right where you order below the digital menu boards is the alcohol. The alcohol of choice are beer on tap and twisted freezes. The twisted freezes allow for some creativity. Customers can add vodka, tequila, or rum to any of the eight flavor bases. The customer can order the drink in two different sized souvenir cups.   It was on Christmas Day, 2017 when I stopped here for lunch. This was my first visit to a Taco Bell since June, 2013. With so many Christmas decorated hotels & attractions to see and work the next morning, I wanted something fast and inexpensive. In my opinion any meal less than $10 on the Strip is inexpensive. For approximately $8, I ordered the Nacho Bell Grande meal that included a Taco and 32 ounce drink. Paying little heed to the alcohol drinks in front of me, I headed to the caffeinated drinks in back of me. They were Pepsi beverages. After the meal the 32 ounce refill came to good use on my continued travels along the Strip. Back to the food. In my opinion it was filling and pretty good.  Generally speaking I was satisfied with the friendly customer service, atmosphere, selection and food. My one complaint is that the letter fonts on the menu boards are far too tiny. You shouldn't need 2020 vision to order fast food. In contrast to the conclusion of my last Taco Bell review, I will end this one by saying that, \"I will no longer run to the border before I return to a Taco Bell.\" The first flagship Taco Bell restaurant has changed my opinion of Taco Bell for the better. There is an 80 percent return factor.",

It was INSANELY busy, like out the door, and loud so hard to order. They have a DJ up top playing, so its a bit like a club, while eating tacos? LOL   However It was pretty good, and well worth the wait, because of the different options they have compared to a regular taco bell! If you can beat the rush, why not go!",

They have an outdoor seating and also an upstairs dining area and a number of TVs as well. Seating can get limited. The menu is pretty much the same as any other Taco Bell.   As for the difference from any old Taco Bell is they have souvenirs, t shirts, hats etc for sale. And it wouldn't be a Vegas location if alcohol wasn't available. All their freezes/slushes can have shots added to them. I believe they have a live DJ there probably at night. And most importantly it's open 24 hours.

The menu is like any other Taco Bell, was expecting more an exclusive menu that is not served at other Taco Bell and it was just more flavor for the freeze and adding hard liquor to it and then 6 items that is not at any other Taco Bell which was shareable. But everything is served at another other Taco Bell the the 7 later deep jut now it's to share. Nothing big.   Service is good, decor is great.

And why am I paying so much for a freaking taco?  Just because I'm in Vegas?  Screw that, if I'm overpaying it's for something unique and amazing, not something I can get at my local drive-thru.  We went here around 2am on a Sunday morning, because...obviously. Long lines, it moved slow, the music was loud, people were drunk...actually come to think of it, it's a lot like most Taco Bells normally are.  ;)  The staff was nice, the food came out at a good pace. They pulled all of the hot sauce trays so we couldn't get any which was a bummer. There is a big window where you can look in and see everyone in the kitchen making the orders which is cool.  Lots of alcohol slush drinks, pina colada, baja blast, cherry, etc.  That seems cool, though I didn't get any.  We sat outside in the covered patio, plenty of music still booming.  It was fun to eat Taco Bell in Vegas only because it seems so silly, is in fact, silly. But if everyone in the group wants to go, what are you gonna do?",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I absolutely LOVE Taco Bell! When I heard that there was a Taco Bell that served alcohol I knew at that moment I had to squeeze that into my itenerary. I love the setup! The building has high ceilings and when you walk up the stairs you feel as though you are in an actual nightclub. The music is bumping... screens everywhere with various sports games going... a real bar... it's pretty legit. The only thing I didn't care for was the fact that all of the items at a normal TB (ones off the strip) aren't offered here. Outside of that, I was pretty pleased. Customer service was satisfactory and the food was prepared quickly. I'll likely return when I come back to Vegas at the end of the summer.",

    "text": "If you love \"The Bell\" as much as I do then you've got to make at least one stop (or in my case multiple stops) to the Taco Bell Cantina. Why you ask? Well, let me tell you.  First and foremost they have frozen Baja Blast featuring your favorite liquors: tequila or vodka. Your choice my friend, choose wisely. A cup of frozen Baja Blast will set you back $10, but worth every (insert which President is on that bill because honestly, at the moment, I can't remember).  The atmosphere here is much better than any other T. Bell you'll go to. It's got music playing, like fun club music, not boring muzak-type music. It's got two floors and features outdoor seating. It's got this lounge vibe, but really you're lounging with your gordita.  You can buy merchandise here! I mean, they have these taco hats and boxer shorts. Things you totally do not need, but when in Vegas and when the alcohol takes over your system, you just might buy it.  The pricing is still on brand. Being in Vegas, things can get rather expensive, but hey, Taco Bell is here for you. I may or may not have gotten a 5 dollar cravings box while in town, and yes, it was still 5 dollars and yes, it featured everything I know and love about the 5 dollar cravings box I get here at home. Who says Vegas rips you off? Well, at least not at the Taco Bell Cantina.  The staff was friendly. I mean, wouldn't you love to work here too? It's open 24 hours so I imagine they see some fun sites working the midnight shift.  Say what you want about Taco Bell, but this one is legit. It be its own type of tourist trap, but it works.",

We're talking \"the sun is already up and you are full of regrets about the night before\" kind of visits. In fact, I had no idea that the Taco Bell Cantina was in this area, I was actually heading to McDonald's and ended up stumbling on to here as it was right next door.  So as you can imagine, I had zero desire to get a spiked Baja Blast. A regular did fine for me, thank you very much. Aside from that, also happened to come here during the return of the Naked Chicken Chalupa (score!). Other stuff I managed to put down was a steak quesadilla, some tacos, and random other crap lol. Look when you're tired and starving, you don't really care what you put down as long as it's edible lol.  Staff here is friendly, but a bit slow in getting the food to you. With that said, I'm not gonna bitch too much considering this place is open 24/7 and I came here at 8 am each time. I'm just glad this is open 24/7, so I'll give them a pass. I'm sure it's better during regular hours.  Overall, I'm glad I found out about Taco Bell Cantina. It definitely adds to my post-partying food options of Earl's or McDonald's LOL.",

When we visited it was under construction so the patio was pretty hot and there was only one bathroom but it looks like they are making some improvements and expanding.   Prices are comparable to regular Taco Bell prices and there were a couple of menu items that I haven't seen at regular TBs. The food is your standard Taco Bell fare so if you don't like TB then you can pass but if you do, or if you'd like to spend less than $5 on a meal in Vegas stop by!",

And those alcoholic freezes? They're fantastic. They're worth the trip alone.   Now, there are a few things to knock this location down. First off, the venue is slightly different than your regular Taco Bell. Mainly...no cinnamon twists. What a bummer as those are a staple of my Taco Bell meal! Oh well.   But secondly, and more importantly in my opinion, this location is LOUD. Like way too loud. They make it feel like you're in a club setting which is just too much. It's off setting. I've eaten in this location once and honestly hated every second of it because it was too loud. The second time I just got my food to go and it was much much better. I really wish they could find a happy medium here. If they could make it so you could carry a conversation with your friends at an even semi-normal level, this place would get a 5 stars rating from me no doubt.",

It's right off the strip and very easy to find. The food is your basic Taco Bell food. We did not try the frozen drinks since we came from Fat Tuesday, but overall I had a fun experience here. I LOVE ordering on the touch screens! I can double check my own order and add all my extras myself.   The reason for my low rating is the staff, one employee in particular. They were out of something we ordered and instead of telling us this, they just improvised and gave us something else to substitute it. They did not even tell us about the substitution when they handed us the food. Naturally, we went back to let them know them our order was wrong, and the employee rudely told us they were out so he gave us something else instead. You can't just give someone something different from what they paid for without asking, it was the WORST substitution too. Instead of ordering something else we just refunded the wrong item. They should update their menu when they run out of stuff so it won't even be selected.  What piss poor customer service with a piss poor attitude. We were not rude or anything, just confused. What that employee did was completely irresponsible, people have food allergies. The manager was really nice about the refund though so I did not feel it necessary to complain about the employee. I left that for yelp.  Other than that, this place is tha bomb. The food was just as delicious as ever. I just hope the next time I visit that employee is not there.",

    "text": "Taco Bell is Taco Bell....unless you're in Las Vegas. And then, well, it's still Taco Bell. You're still gonna get your staple cheesy gordita crunch and chalupas and all that jazz. But one thing that sets this Taco Bell apart from others (besides the name) are the drinks.   Yeah, you don't need a PHD in Taco-ology to figure out what I'm talking about here. You want a frozen drink? Sure. You want it with a little extra kick? Well now you're talkin'!   The females of my family heard about this not-so-ordinary T-Bell before our Vegas trip and after flying in late to Sin City, we made this our first stop for food. But again, it was more for the drinks.   I mean a frozen Baja Blast is good on its own, but when you add rum to the thing? Woah. And you could get it with said liquor or choose vodka, whiskey, or even tequila. Nice. Very nice. Beyond that it's basically nothing special (service was friendly though) outside of a pretty well-themed, contemporary-style Taco Bell complete with taco hats for purchase, of course....  Overall, Taco Bell Cantina is worthy of a stop, especially if you ever find yourself at your neighborhood T-Bell at 2:30 in the mornin' after a night of drinkin'. Instead, come here and get those drinks along with your \"fourth meal.\" Enjoy, mis amigos.",

It is one dollar less than the original fat tuesday however I feel like it isn't as worth it because I'm not sure if they do refills here.   I think most people go here because you get some hints of nostalgia with the slushies combined with adult fun with the alcohol.

We had seen the promo video for this new taco bell. Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations or maybe we were just expecting way more. This place was crowded AF and not just because it was busy but because the lay out of the place is just not that convenient. I thought they had a merchandise area but it was only really a small rack, then I thought they had new items on their menu but sadly it was only the slushie drinks which I heard were good but weak in the alcohol level. Big props for being open 24hrs and being in a great location but nothing new or awesome to rave about this particular taco bell. I say check it out for sure at least once or late at night when you're drunk and itching for some crunchy tacos.",

Meh.  \\_()_/    It's pretty cool that you can get alcohol with your Baja Freeze, but what's not cool is paying $27 for it.   The order line situation in this establishment is highly inefficient. There really is no natural flow of traffic-- just cashiers yelling on the top of their lungs \"NEXT NEXT I CAN HELP YOU HERE\" while flailing their limbs around.   From the videos I've seen online, they made it seem like this place was MASSIVE, but really a local Taco Bell in your neighborhood would probably be 3 times as big as this special one. It's always overly crowded because of the hype, and you can't really enjoy the ambiance with people surrounding breathing on your Crunch Wrap Supreme...   Never again... Maybe unless I'm super drunk and need Doritos Locos Taco  \\_()_/ ",

They have a nice patio out front, with a security guard, and an upstairs space with a DJ. So you're in for a loud atmosphere. The inside area really didn't seem all that big to me but it's a cool space.   Sodas are served through taps which is cool and there's a huge array of different slushies, all of which you can order with alcohol. The food menu is the same, nothing fancier or unique. You can watch your food being prepared which may interest some.   For a late night cheap snack on the strip, I would choose the Cantina as my spot, but nothing more than that.",

    "text": "Of course the most \"lit\" taco bell place has to be in Vegas.  Boyfriend and I bookmarked this place way before we both got to Vegas due to all the hype and the social media publicity it was getting. It's located behind Planet Hollywood Hotel and is situated near McDonald's as well.  After walking through the outside seating, the automatic door opens and 2016 hip hop music was blasting. There were some fixtures of merchandise and a security guard was closely standing by supervising the area.   I'm not going to lie when I say it looked a lot smaller than what it seemed to be however the taco bell ordering counter looks super cool with the lights and the different lighted liquid tubes. Boyfriend treated us to a pina colada with tequila along with a beefy fritos burrito for me and a taco for himself. Food was done not too long after because it's fast food. They had indoor seating on the second floor, but it was packed so we headed to the outdoor seating instead. The food is the same basic taco bell stuff, but the drink won for me. It was super good and satisfying for my midnight munchies.   They had a lot of flavors so I will definitely be back! Great place for cheap cravings.",

People even get married in this taco bell lol Yes married with a taco bell food package that comes with it which is hilarious to me but hey its VEGAS. The customer service was great. The only thing I would say is add more alcohol to the slushy, it seemed more watery than anything then I will give 5 stars.",

It tastes fresh but not as good as regular. The line was long and a few people block the passage to get the food and the guy at the front has to talk thru the microphone to say your name out loud.

It was a great combo of seasoned beef and Acqua di Gio.  Romance was definitely in the air.  The other guy's wife and I danced the night away as we stuffed our faces with delicious Taco Bell fare and beer they ingeniously serve from the bottom of the cup at what is arguably the best after hours club on The Strip.

My wife politely said she'd prefer tequila and the employee rolled her eyes and then made the drink.

I witnessed about 20 orders go in front of mine. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. They also just \"threw out\" the couples order in front of us and messed their order up too. Please avoid this place. WE JUST GOT A REFUND AND LEFT. Screw this place. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE",

Only negative is that it's hard af to order cuz the music is so loud. You basically have to order your food exactly like at the bar, chest on the counter and yell into the ear of the cashier.",

    "text": "I saw the promotional video on Facebook that got a lot of attention, so I figured I should check it out. It was a \"classier\" Taco Bell in the sense that the decorations and food presentation was nicer - the food itself was standard. The unique thing about this Taco Bell is they serve the alcoholic slushy! I got the pina-colada with a tequila shot, which was about $10.... it was overpriced for sure because I would have gotten better value somewhere else. However, if you want an alcoholic Baja blast, then this is the only place. Overall, don't fall for the hype.. it's your standard Taco Bell, but more expensive and has alcohol.",

The cashiers were not friendly at all and were less than enthusiastic to answer any questions I had about the drinks. It seemed like such an inconvenience. Food was good, as always--being it is a taco bell. It was kind of empty. We went upstairs and they had a DJ, he was playing pretty old music, but not bad. There was one bathroom upstairs, and there was always a line. Drinks were expensive. Small one only had one shot, the size up had 2 shots and were about 10-20 price range--I can buy a bottle with that money. Nothing special, but if you love taco bell and want to hang out here, its pretty chill.",

After going to their upstairs which is a cool environment with TVs we tried their mixer smoothie things. After completing them there wasn't nearly a lick of alcohol in them. As a local I would avoid having an incredibly overpriced drink here and would take my money to fat tuesdays.. they actually put alcohol in their drinks..",

When I finally got up to order my drink I ordered a \"twisted Baja blast\" which is exactly what it said on the menu. They are $9.99. She comes back with and charges me $15 because it's in a souvenir cup. I told her I didn't order the cup and she rolls her eyes at me and I just said forget it I'll just take it. I didn't feel like putting up a fight over the music that was way too loud and over the noise of the workers calling out the names of people who's orders were ready. Save your time and just go to a normal Taco Bell",

I thought it was a joke and I really couldn't believe that this actually existed. So what did I do, I went to go find it and holy mother of god IT EXISTS!!! Does it get busy folks. You better have a good wait time just for Taco Bell food and alcohol. Another thing beer and Taco Bell food goes well together. They also have like a viewing window to see how the employees make your food. There's an upstairs DJ Room but when I went it was closed bc they don't open up the room until 9 pm.",
