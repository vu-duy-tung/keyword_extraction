    "text": "While I was happy to see a chicken wing place open up nearby, I must say I'm disappointed.   First, I asked if any of their flavor were a dry rub or a wet sauce. The girl said all wet. I specifically asked about the Garlic parmesan. Got 28 wings, fries and a sweet tea. $29, not bad.   The fries were delicious, hot and tasty and not over salted. The sweet tea was also good.   The wings? Not even as good as wingstop or BWW. I'd compare them to run of the mill bar wings.   The sauces? They all had little to no flavor, I got their hottest ones and they weren't even slightly hot. Their garlic parmesan was a dry rub with butter mixed in or something. Not even tasty. The mango habanero was decent.   The Ranch? Pretty Damn good actually. Better than most places.   The service? Friendly and was decently quick.   I actually went away wanting my money back. I always try a place twice, let's hope next time is better.",

That kind of sauce is too sticky and sweet to have so much just sitting in the container. The garlic parm was just ok...a lil too much garlic and not enough parm.  Service was super fast and staff was friendly.  I'd go back and maybe try another flavor...or maybe just make my own like Ive been doing :)",

They don't do half flavors on the 6 pack of wings, but they will if you get 9 or more. I also got the fried pickles as a side. I decided on Voodoo, which is kind of sweet with sriracha sauce, and Mango Habanero, which is supposed to be hot. Both were actually sweet, and not very hot at all, so don't be afraid to try the hotter sounding flavors. The fried pickles were, not as good as I've had back home, but better than anything else here.   The store was clean, and the girl behind the counter was sweet. She even brought the food out to me. They also have a drive-thru, which is nice.   Overall, I wasn't terribly impressed with the place, but they're ok for fast food wings.",

(my fault, yes i know) when i returned to work i noticed she only gave me back $70 dollars in change. so being the fact my order was only 10 she under paid me by $20 dollars. im just not going to give her the benefit of the doubt, and im almost 100 percent positve she took it on purpose. mainly because she paid me in nothing but 5 dollar bills!! that is off by 4 bills......... be aware of this place with your money!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Voodoo probably their social sauce since it's on their name. It taste like a Siracusa and soy sauce, but I'm not too sure. I order 8 piece voodoo, 8 BBQ and 8 garlic parmesan. Totaling 24 wings and a bread pudding.   What's great about this place is the fact that their wings are not the tiny ones you usually get when ordering wings. It's pretty massive. Plentiful tables to chose from, huge tv screen to watch tv and the service was 10/10. The wings were served super quick and the ladies taking my order were so nice.   This place got spunk, in a good way. These wings, mind blowing. Sooooooo delicious. Out of the three wings I ordered the garlic parmesan was my favorite. Crispy and hot.   Definitely returning for more wings, ordering another 24! For my wing lovers and finger food people, go try this establishment already. Voodoo is super wicked.",

Which makes my wife and I happy because we love chicken wings but walking in wasn't so great. You can smell the oil from the front door right (like old or stale oil) when you walk in. We wanted to get something we could eat thru out the day cause we just wanted to be lazy and lounge all day , so we ordered to go. The wait wasn't long which always makes us happy.   We ordered a total of 30 wings for our all day long Netflix binge watching session. We got medium and hot buffalo style hot wings made from the franks hot sauce brand. and lemon pepper chicken wings. With extra ranch.   Once we got home we opened our wings and transferred the wings into bowls, we were disappointed by how much oil there was at the bottom of each box. The lemon pepper did not taste like lemon pepper at all maybe the oil took the flavor away I don't know but it was basically a waste of money. The best in flavor was the buffalo hot wings , the medium was so greasy we just mixed them with the buffalo hot.   All in all I give this place a three out of five stars. IF we ever tried this place again we would definitely ask for no excessive oil and check the boxes before leaving.",

This place is a short drive away from my house so when I forget how unimpressive Voodoo wings are, I order out. I've tried mild, lemon pepper, garlic parmesan, and teriyaki. I find the wings to be a little dry and the garlic parmesan super oily. The consistency of the dipping sauces is a little weird to be as well, the honey mustard smelled like mayo and was super thick. Blue cheese was hella thick as well.  I wish fries was better, last time we got food from here, I was craving fries and my sweetie wanted wings but only one of us ended up satisfied. The fries had NO seasoning at all. I had to season it myself. Rude! I did like the fried pickles though, yum!",

I went through the drive-thru, which turned out to be a good thing. Apparently the air conditioning was out and it was a little warm inside. There were no cars in front of me, but it seemed to take awhile to get my grub.  I got an eight piece \"bite\" combo. \"Bite\" is Vodoo's boneless wing. I ordered \"hot\" as my flavor of choice and got bleu cheese for my dipping sauce. The combo comes with eight \"bites\", choice of side and a beverage. I opted for cole slaw instead of fries. The slaw didn't compare to grandma's, but then again, nothing does. It was decent and the portion size was sufficient.  The chicken was breaded and smothered in hot wing sauce.  It was tender with good flavor. The combo meal was just a tad over eight bucks.  All in all, it was A-Ok. I will definitely give it another go and see if a four star upgrade is in order.",

As soon as I ate the first one I thought the flavor was off, but they were cooked well, crispy without being dry and apparently I was really in the mood for wings and ate them all.   So I'm really glad Yelp doesn't have a comments section where people can't roast me for the faulty logic behind this three star review.   Anyway, just check everything about your order before you leave the building. My experience with every other place I've been to should have made me do that. But I didn't. And now I'm salty.",

There has been two people that are really nice and friendly I usually see them in drive thru during the day. Just FYI to other customer there is a bit of a wait if you go through drive thru I honestly have no problem with it because the food is worth it. Back to the customer service... The workers seem careless and they do not know how to properly greet or even smile. I came through drive thru one day and no one even greeted me. So I waited thinking they were just busy but I gave up and walked inside. Turns out the girl that was working drive thru didn't even have her head set on and just said \"I didn't even hear anything\". Her head set was around her neck! I work fast food and I know how to work in a drive through I was furious when I saw that. I still was nice to her as I ordered and she just made me feel uncomfortable as if I ruined her conversation with the other workers. Btw the other workers at the time didn't seem to care either all of them just stood together In a group talking. None of them greeted also. I honestly love their food but would never come back. Which will probably make their workers happy since they don't like to work decently.  There has been other times the workers have made me feel not welcomed here but I've brushed that off so many times because I tried to consider that they are just having a rough day or something. But like I said before there's only two good workers, good food, but mostly horrible employees.",

I only say 24 wings because they were generous with the count. Got 3 sauces: medium, garlic parmesan, and mango habanero. Garlic Parmesan was by far my favorite. Crispy and good size wings. Definitely going back.",

I was disappointed to see that Guthrie's had gone out of business since I think they were much better than Cane's.  This was really just a trial run I was giving Voodoo so I just went basic with 9 mild wings.  They were great. Much better than I had ever expected.  They were very meaty and the sauce was excellent.   I hate all these places that have anorexic looking wings, this place does not have that problem.  I will definitely be back to try some different flavors and sides.  The fact that this place has a drive trough just makes it that much better.  A drive thru wing place ROCKS!  They need a website though.",

As first timers we were excited to try their signature Voodoo sauce which had good flavor as did their BBQ, and Garlic Parm but the real problem was the wings themselves. Gummy skin and zero taste to the meat underneath had us throwing most of our meal away. I won't be back. Plus the staff was less than helpful and seemed unclear when we asked if they offered chicken fingers they said NO never offering up the chicken bites which are pretty much what we were looking for.",

Garlic Parm has no flavor.  Will never be back.  They'll probably be shut down by the end of the year anyways.  Step your game up VooDoo!",

I tried about four thinking it was maybe one that got over salted, but no they all were disgusting and inedible. Going on to the wings the lemon pepper were also to salty I ate one. Btw I love salt, I salt everything and for me it was extreme. You can taste that they're using old oil with everything because it all tastes like the nasty fried pickles.",

I had seen this place several times because it's right off the freeway and I decided to give it a try. Very clean friendly establishment. Nice flat screen TV to enjoy the game while you wait or dine in. We took ours to go and I ordered the family meal. I tried my favorite which is always garlic parm and also lemon pepper bbq and voo doo. Now reading the reviews for this place you see mixed feelings over the voo doo wings. Let me tell you I enjoyed these wings the most even despite garlic parm usually being my favorite. We also got sides but the real attraction here was the wings and maybe the banana pudding to top it all off. All around I was very impressed and will be returning here and telling everyone I know.",

Had a little kick to it but not hot at all. These would be a go to wing here. Then I tried The Bomb Wings.. and let me tell you, if they didn't take all the old chicken wing bones and grind them up into a fine powder, mixed it with black magic and then had a witch doctor look at your Facebook picture as he made this sauce especially for you! Every bite takes a little of your soul and I hear they make a Voodoo doll of you when you leave. I think they took some of my hair. Do not eat the Bomb wings if you don't want pieces of your soul taken. I will say, these might be the hottest wings I have ever had, I did have to have some honey and I did have tears rolling from my eyes which is a very first for me! (Would've named these Voodoo Wings instead) Shout out to JAMES the manager who runs the joint. Super cool dude and remembers his customers. The staff was also very friendly.

I went through the drive through and the girl easily answered my questions about the difference in sauces. Originally I was deciding  between The Bomb and Voodoo. She explained that they both had soy sauce but The Bomb had things like Ghost Pepper and etc. so I figured I'd save that flavor for the boyfriend. I decided to go with Mango Habanero and it was excellent. She was extremely helpful and very friendly. I really appreciate when the person at the drive through shows good customer service.  I ordered the bayou bites and they were great. Each bite is all chicken tossed in your preferred sauce. She said I could split the order with two sauces for an additional charge.   This place isn't near me but when I'm over on this side of town I'll definitely be back. Good job Voodoo!",

I come here often and I always make my order through the drive thru okay voodoo wings company by far serve the best wings in Town!! From sweet to Painful spicy (seriously). I always order \"garlic Parmesan(garlicky but oily)\" and \"the bomb(painful spicy but very good flavor)\"   but their customer service is so horrible . The lady that takes the order at the drive thru seems to have a very bad hygiene. And a very bad attitude! Seriously she were wearing jeans that were too tight for her that her \"you know what\" was showing smh n her shirt was rolled up in the back ! Also I was waiting on my food n their window was opened I over heard them talking sexual to each other about some guy! Soon as she brang me my drink she didn't approach me she just hand me the drink I told her thank you n she didn't respond just closed the window then few mins later I am waiting on my chicken she was scratching her head like she was frustrated bcs she was yelling at someone in the back soon as she brang me my food she just hand it to me n closed the window ! It was very rude!   Voodoo please take the time to check on your employees and retrain them on their customer service! I would have gave this place a 5 stars but the customer service is horrible and I am not the only one writing this review on the horrible service",

    "text": "Solid 3 1/2 Stars!  Can't believe this place was a former KFC...imagine the irony, now it's a wing joint!  Voodoo Wings does some decent grub!  I do have another preferred chain for chicken wings, but Voodoo will do in a pinch.  They have some standard wing flavors along with some new concoctions.  We tried a 12 piece wing set to go in the following flavors:  -Hot -Garlic Parmesan  Verdict?  Wings are just OK.  They were not bad at all but they seemed a tad smaller in size compared to other wing places around town.  Voodoo's hot wings were average, they weren't very hot at all & they were a bit drowned out in flavor.  Still pretty good with blue cheese for dipping though!  The Garlic Parmesan flavor wings were just OK as well.  I wanted them to have more cheese flavor, these were heavier on the salt.  Standout though were the Fried Pickles!  These were tasty!  They were battered just right, crispy but not too thick.  Batter was flavorful too, salty, zesty, spicy all in one bite!  I would go to Voodoo Wings again just to order these.  Prices were on par with other wing places here in LV, it cost us under $20 for 12 wings, celery, side of Fried Pickles, and a large drink.  On a good note, all that food managed to feed a family of 3 just right!    Likin' the voodoo that you doo!",

The lemon pepper was good and the traditional hot was good, but seemed a tad bit spicy than what I imagined what hot was. Voodoo is still a top choice when it comes to chicken wings for me.",

    "text": "We were getting a bit hungry and we're headed to a Thai place in the Northwest and decided to try VooDoo Wings based on some of the reviews.   The place is a former take out fast food place repurposed and it is a bit dicey inside and outside.   The wings are a good price, so we decided to try the 24 pack. You get up to three flavors and we went with two,  the lemon pepper and the garlic parmesan.   You have sauces from hottest to mild which are quite a good selection.  They do have other choices that would include sides like fries or veggies.   Service- awesome. The team there is. Very customer friendly and they are efficient and seem fun.   Ambiance- I feel like I was in a bus stop in an old part of an old downtown somewhere. Unimaginative and kind of needing TLC.   The Wings - they deep fry the wings and then toss them in the sauce. No dry flavors, all wet.  The wings we're way over cooked to point of shrinking and sticking to the bone. These are not your fall off the bone wings. These were underwhelming at best. In our paper trays, the amount of oil on the bottom, not sauce but oil, was about the thickness of 1/4 inch. Alot of oil.  Unappealing oil??? Too bad.   The sauce-  found the garlic Parmesan to be awesome. Chunks of garlic mixed in creating a wonderful flavor to a tough and smallish wing.  The lemon pepper?  I could not taste it. Glad that the wings were not drenched in the sauce.   Overall, I am going to say that I was very underwhelmed with the cooking and with the oil and the overall flavor. It was not busy when I was there at 11:30am on a Saturday. A solid 2 and 1/2 stars that I round up to three.",

The service at the drive-thru was pretty quick and the young lady there very nice. I told her it was my first time and she recommended that I mix up the flavors of the wings. I got a side of fries and cole slaw to go with the wings. The cole slaw was crunchy and fresh. The wings were large, hot, and juicy. The fries were hot and flavorful. They give you a lot of fries and I was surprised at the size of the cole slaw. Pretty big. I will definitely go back!!  it was worth the effort to brave the cold. Two Thumbs Up!!!!!",

I noticed the sauce was very watery, too. Voodoo was a little spicy, and far better tasting than Mild, and the sauce clung to the wings better.   The wings were soft, but not mushy. Had the outside been crispy, I would have awarded 5 stars. I wanted to give 3.5 stars, but since there are no halves, I'll give 4 for the ability to order online or via drive-thru.",

My friend I order to eat there and once we finished, we ended up ordering more to eat lol.

I love basic hot wings and they did a great job on those. My bf loves more mild or bbq. We inhaled these as soon as we got home. The wings were a decent size and we're still piping hot by the time I got home (about 15 mins). I would definitely come here over BWW.

    "text": "So, my boyfriend went here the other day after watching Hot Ones (the youtube series) and got the Bomb wings. Needless to say, they were crazy hot and he couldn't really eat them.Today, a few days later, I wanted to try their other flavors of wings after watching ANOTHER episode of Hot Ones. That show makes you want wings in the worst way. Haha.  I ordered a 12 piece, half Voodoo and half Mango Habanero for him; I went with the 9 piece, half hot and half lemon pepper -- well done! And I just HAD to try these fried pickles everyone keeps raving about with a Dr. Pepper.   I am obsessed with the lemon pepper wings, they were cooked exactly how I like them with great flavor. The hot wings are super good too, especially with the ranch. I didn't try my boyfriend's wings but he seemed super pleased with them as well. The fried pickles deserve a paragraph for themselves but I'll just say they were AMAZING and I would come back just for those.   The last thing I want to say is, you guys were not kidding about the soda machine. It is the absolute worst damn soda (if you want to call it that) I have ever had. It was just carbonated water with a splash of odd tasting syrup. I threw it away.  Besides the soda, it was a super awesome experience with more than enough redeeming qualities to make me forget all about that teensy detail. As I sit here shoveling wings and fried pickles in my face, I am telling you that you need to give this place a try. Oh! And I received excellent service from an adorable girl at the window. Thank you for that as well, we'll be back!",

Just enough flavor and not spicy. The Parmesan wings are always hard to get right but they did. I've had better when it comes to the teriyaki flavor but it was still good. They gave us plenty of ranch and some celery. The drive thru is very convenient. Usually a lot of people and they do pretty good on speed of service.  Would definitely recommend and will definitely be eating these wings in the future !",

A ton for the small price!  The cashier came around to check on us as we ate. She even offered to get the nearby table refills on their drinks. Another associate was extremely pleasant as well taking phone and drive through orders. So food wants bad. Service was over the top!

Part of order was messed up, didn't complain let the staff know and they didn't offer to fix it BUT again food is good. Self serve drinks been down for awhile so have to ask for them.  I hope the manager or owner reads the reviews and fixes it because we want to come back and if things remain the same and service is lacking don't know how that will work.   Cashier was friendly was a young man and the lady cooking was nice the lady who didn't offer to help with messed up order was maybe a supervisor? Not to sure.",

I ordered the bayou bites rolled in mango habanero (which cost me $1 extra), with honey mustard dipping sauce. The chicken was good quality white meat, with good flavors. The mango habanero really negated the need for any dipping sauce. To charge an extra buck for added flavor seems odd. The fries that came with the meal were okay, and could have been cooked a little longer.  I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to go here for lunch, but I also don't see me making any special effort to return. Personally, I prefer the much larger selection of boneless wings and sauces offered by Buffalo Wild Wings -- and I can get a beer there, which is not an option at VooDoo Wing Co.",

If your company specialty is chicken wings you can just focus on the sauce you have to have a good quality chicken wings with plenty of meat on them. Unfortunately these were not great quality chicken wings. Probably will try the Boneless next time, because the fries were so good & the sauces were excellent as well, this would probably be the only other option for us to continue getting food from Voodoo.",

Then they changed it later to this frozen crinkle looking fry that seriously sucked, and now I've noticed they have changed it again to a more homemade, shaved right off the potato and fried kind of fry (see picture). The current fries are an improvement, but not as good as their original fries. I'm not sure why they keep changing them. I love their wings so much that I just make an extra stop and combine them with McDonald's fries. Sometimes the wait can be ridiculously long, but the wings are fire.",

Wings were meaty and well cooked - nice and crispy. Boneless wings were some of the best I've ever had. Good amount of all white meat chicken and not a ton of breading.   We had lemon pepper which was real good. VooDoo sauce which was very unique - on the spicier side with a hint of teriyaki. And The Bomb sauce which was plenty hot - very Louisiana/Tabasco hot flavor. The Ranch was good, a little thicker than I am used to.   I included a pic of the \"sidewinder\" fries because I had no idea what that meant. I wasn't crazy about them but they weren't particularly bad.   The fried pickles were outstanding! Great breading. Very southern.   Oh, and we ordered this to go, through the yelp app and picked it up in the drive thru. Very convenient.  Definitely highly recommend this place!!",

We ordered 6 piece sweet heat chicken wings, 6 piece hot chicken wings, macaroni salad, french fries, fried pickles and 2 sweet teas since I always hear and read about people stating how amazing the teas are.  The sweet heat sauce was really sweet. No heat to it at all. I liked it but wish there was a little heat to it. The hot sauce was actually what it is hot. I liked it. The French fries were great. Crispy outside and soft on the inside. I fried pickles were great too. Only if they had a dipping sauce for it :(. The macaroni salad was a little bit in the salty side. The sweet teas... WAY TO SWEET! I swear I thought they put a whole bag of sugar in itt. I watered mine down and it was still to sweet that I had to have them put some unsweetened tea in it which the lady at the counter was super nice and didn't mind doing that for me.  The staff were all super nice. Very pleasant and they all greet you as soon as you walk in. It was also clean on the inside as well. I can't wait to try this place out again!",

You can buy in various counts, the larger orders can be in 2 to 3 flavors.  I bought a 12 piece and chose mild and lemon pepper.  The wings were delightfully crispy without being greasy and full of flavor. My son chose the bites and was equally pleased. It does take a little longer to get the food as your food appears to be prepared fresh. The wings are not breaded. They have some  unusual sides such as fried pickles.   Overall, we'll be going back.",

Both were good but I like some kick so the Voodoo was my choice of the two. I might kick it up a notch tho and try the Mango Habanera next time. So grab a couple friends for lunch or dinner and let's keep this place rocking, I like having a wing spot in the hood and I'll be back for sure...See ya there..!!",

Not only that, but  they are HUGE! waaaayyyy more meat then BWW or Wing Stop and they are much faster than them as well .... not to mention better priced as well!  I waited no more than 10 minutes for an order of 9 lemon pepper wings, 9 mango habanero wings, 12 hot wings and a bites combo . They also come with celery and sauce, which is a nice difference from the other wing places as well . My husband is super picky about his lemon pepper chicken, but he absolutely loves theirs!  We will continue to be frequent customers!!",

    "text": "I was pleased to see Gutherie's go out.  I had high hopes for Voodoo wings as I love a good wing as a quick dinner to pick up.  I'll start out with what I liked best, the fried pickles were good.  Fresh, hot and crispy and a lot of them for the price.  I also ordered 12 wings, half with Habenero/Mango and half with Parmesan/Garlic.  They were OK but nothing all that special.  The parmesan was the better of the two but I did like the spice of the habenero.  They just weren't anything special.  It seems like the stole a concept from like Buffalo Wing Wings or Wing Stop and figured that a bunch of young people could make a go out of imitation.  Actually I was more surprised by the staff and the feeling of the place.  Very cold, plain and the people working there seemed disinterested, easily distracted.  There was no real sense of being welcome and instead just a bunch of people who were doing their job.  They could take a lesson from the El Pollo Loco just about a mile west when it comes to welcoming a guest.  They got my order straight but I am not sure if I will be going back. Like so many local places it lacks any real charm or originality.  I also felt there was a smell to the place that I couldn't identify.  So while it might be the best wings in the area I am not so sure that is saying all that much.",

They even offer honey mustard as a sauce. They even have a drive through so 5 stars all the way around. Service is also very quick and very decently priced.

The fries were great (according to my girlfriend) the potato salad although good the portion was incredibly small. It came in a 2 oz little plastic cup and was definitely not what I expected for $1.89 worth of potato salad which is why only 4 stars.  Other than that this place is a smash hit, avoid the sides get the wings you can mix and match the flavors as well and you won't be disappointed at all.  Watch out other wing places this is a serious contender in my opinion!",

Hardly any sauce and very little taste. The two stars are for the fried pickles, which are fantastic.",

The tables are dirty. There's also a cute girl they have working the register with curly hair and glasses that doesn't have the necessary customer service skills yet. Doesn't even smile. But hopefully with more training she'll be an awesome asset to the company. Maybe this is her first job, I don't know. Lol! But I'd love to see her blossom into an employee of the month. :) everyone deserves a chance to rise to the top!  Anyways, the cooks that they have are exemplary!! Especially the Caucasian dude with facial hair!! They're engaging with the guests and you can tell that they're enjoying their job! They have another cook who is African American who is sweet and does his job fast!  The other lady who was working the register has short strawberry blonde hair and an amazing personality! She's so sweet and knowledgeable about this establishment and is very charismatic.  Lastly, there's an older gentleman who is also African American and wears glasses who is an absolute sweetheart. I think he's the manager idk. We observed him being a team player with his crew while also tackling down orders in the back!  We love this place. Love, love, LOVE!!",

I just thought it was called the bomb because it's good.  Not because there would be a bomb in the mouth .. it was intense. I dipped the chicken into the sauce and literally the right side of my mouth went numb and then my ears started ringing. Yeah. It was that bad!! So beware. It's freaking spicy. Not in a good way, more like a numbing way.. all in all it was okay. The fries were probably the best part about the meal. I'm glad I got them. The wings were a little small, I wish it was meatier!",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today. I had 6 Mango Habanero and 6 Cajun Ranch along with some fried pickles and a large drink all coming to about $18. I worked in a wing place for 10 years so do know a bit about wings.  They cooked the wings fresh (takes about 12-14 minutes in a fryer so don't go expecting wings right away and you never should.) and they were the perfect crispiness, not burnt, just enough to get the crunch on the outside but tender juiciness on the inside. The wings are slightly smaller than other places I've been, but not enough to make a big difference. The fried pickles were some of the best I ever had and for a side portion did come with quite a bit, easily shareable for two.  Each set of wings came with 1 carrot stick and 1 celery stick which to me seemed..... underwhelming and I think no veggies would have sold the presentation more. Most places I've been you get 4-5 veggies per order of 6 but again not that big of a deal to me, it just looked really sad with a single piece of celery and single carrot slice on each. I loved the mango habanero a ton. The Cajun Ranch was alright but I will not order it again if you like peppery tasting chicken though it may be your thing. I let the cashier know it was my first time and she was super helpful in letting me know about the different flavors and which ones I may like as well as offered samples. I am excited to return and try out a few other flavors.",

The whole counter was dirty, as well as the open kitchen, and the messy office that was visible. Aside from that, the actual dining area could use some touching up as well! It just doesn't look clean, we really wanted to eat here, but opted for wing stop instead which was way cleaner.   Cleanliness says a lot about a business. After reading some reviews I see I am not the first to notice unsanitary conditions! I don't care what part of town a restaurant is in, isn't it essential to clean your establishment, so you don't send customers away, better yet contaminate food! I would love to go back if it was cleaned up !",

We told her it was our first time there, so she suggested we try some of the flavors and let us know the hottest started at the top and ended with the mild. The flavors we tried were good, but we choose the lemon pepper, sweet heat and garlic parmesan. All I can say is DAMN GOOD. The lemon pepper tasted like it says and the fries...yumm. I talked to the owner James and I told him I was from Louisiana and so is his family. He is so friendly and nice. He let me sample the fried pickles...BOMB. Even the guys that were cooking were all nice. What I know and what I've learned is that, people will treat you the way that you treat them most of the time.",

This is definitely one of the best places I've been to in town, the other Wing Competitors here arent really up to par with the quality of the chicken itself or the flavor of the sauce. The wings were fresh to order, the sauce wasnt drenched at the bottom which I liked, lots of places put so much sauce on that it can be a bit overwhelming, this place had the right amount.   The fries were delicious, we ordered them well done, perfect balance of salt and pepper! Very crispy, not super greasy either! Very fresh and hot.   Loved the Mango Habanero, it wasnt super spicy, and that makes sense... considering its Mango. So I ordered the actual Hot as well, which was deicious, didnt kill my tastebuds but it was a great hot sauce that was very spicy yet edible.   Chef even came out and asked if everything was alright which was awesome.   As for the whole Cleanliness aspect, The place wasnt dirty. I think those other reviews are rude, but they could liven the place up a little, felt a bit dim and gloomy. If they had a bar here this place would be lit during VGK/sports games  Pretty top notch experience if you ask me. My wife and I will definitely be returning.",

I love their sweet tea as well. The portions are big and we can never finish their unique, thick, spiral fries. We have also had a taste of the fried pickles.

It's funny that they have a drive thru because wings definitely aren't typical drive through food but it appears as if the previous business had a drive thru and VooDoo opted to leave it as part of the restaurant. Which I like!  I got the Mango Habanero and they were good. I think I should have asked for them extra crispy because they were a tad on the soft side and I tend to like them a little more done. Although Mango Habanero is next to their hottest sauce, it wasn't hot at all for me. I didn't even need any water to drink with it.   The fries were tasty. They're a unique shape and were good. Could use a little more seasoning, maybe something with a little more boldness.   The reason the slightly above average wings are getting a 4 star review is because of the young man who worked the drive thru window. He was so nice, very well mannered, gave a solid recommendation, and had an authentic (non-forced) smile. His name on the ticket was Landis P. So shout out to that young man for being awesome. He's going places in life with his attitude.   Try them out at lunch sometime like i did and hopefully he'll be your cashier also!",

I was the ONLY person in drive through the whole time. And it's still early enough that they weren't \"about to close\" I ordered 9 piece wings garlic Parmesan and mango habenero. I was in the drive through for way too long. The guy comes and brings a huge bag obviously not mine. So they hadn't even started my order yet. Wait for them to make my 9piece and they give it to me and I drive off. It's the wrong flavors. So I have to drive back and decided to go inside instead of waste my gas sitting there again. They immediately knew they gave me the wrong order and they have to start my order AGAIN. They've given me a brief insincere \"sorry bout that\" so I wait. Not once did they offer me anything. Not even a second dipping sauce to make things right. I'm clearly not happy. They just avoid eye contact with me. They give me the food and I leave. I make it home just to find that my order is STILL WRONG they gave me garlic parm but the other was some just gross sour hot sauce and SUPER salty. Just terrible.",

When I got there, it's nice to see they have a drive thru since there's definitely very few places with wings who have one.  The choices are just mainly wings and sides.  Flavor choices are hard to choose from since they all sound great. I ordered 12 pieces of Mild and 12 pieces of Lemon Pepper.  Each wing was cooked to perfection and coated perfectly. I like the Lemon Pepper, they were flavorful and juicy.  If you haven't tried Voodoo Wings, you need to! Go Now! Get some wings!",

Ordered the 6 piece mango habanero meal with fries & 12 piece garlic parmesan with potato salad. The mango habanero wasn't spicy,  the garlic parmesan was good, the potato salad was small for $3 but good, and they forgot my fries.   I waited at least 15 min in the drive thru after I had ordered. They didn't tell me to park at any other spot, I was parked in front of the window with another car still behind me. They didn't give me an explanation as to what was taking so long either. Most places have the employee pop out & say \"sorry.....\", I just got the employees to look at me & walk away from the window.  Being that I had just got off of work, I was already too tired of waiting to check the food. After a 20 min drive and checking my food, I call and ask to speak to the manager. I was told that the manager wasnt there today. What place doesn't have some kind of manager on duty at all times? When I advised them that I didnt get my fries, I was asked to come back that night. I told them that wasn't going to happen. I asked to see if they can just refund the fries since I didn't get them. I was told that all they could do was give me free fries when I come back in the next 2 weeks only and took my phone number however wouldnt give me their name. Sounded sketchy and so not worth any arguement if I decided to come back. Never got a call from the manager either.   Ultimately it's pricey for the food and sketchy customer service.",

    "text": "I was a bit disappointed about this place. I really do not like when restaurants dont cater to their customers. They offer different combo options. For 9.99 you can get 9 wings and pick two different flavors. However if you get 24 wings for $18 dollars you can only get two flavors! Apparently you do not get additional perks for buying more wings from them. They are pretty much making you pay $20 dollars for you to get four flavors. I compare the place with buffalo wild wings which allows you to get an extra flavor every five wings. Also they charge you .25 for tap water. I understand it is not a big deal, but I also do not understand why cannot they just show customer appreciation by proving free water. We ordered the medium and sweet heat. Both flavors were good, but I personally enjoyed the sweet heat the most. The fried pickles were really good. The service was also good. Also the fact that they have a drive thru makes this location very convenient. Overall, this is an ok restaurant, but I think I will continue going to buffalo wild wings for additional flavor options.",

The building has been through a few different restaurants in the past few years but I'm hoping voodoo will manage to stick.  The menu is pretty simple they have maybe 10 different flavors of wings all of them wet style.  I think the simplicity is a good thing though, some places try to impress you with huge numbers of flavors and half of them are worthless or taste the same.  Voodoo keeps it simple all their flavors are distinct and more importantly taste great.    I recommend the Voodoo house flavor it's a mix of soy and sriracha sauce but the bbq and hot are also good.  They have some good sides too, I'm not much for fried pickles but my friends can't get enough of them.  I do wish the place was a little bigger but other than that it's a great place to grab some wings if you're in the area.",

After reading the mixed reviews, I was a little apprehensive about trying this place, but I REALLY had a craving for wings, so I went. I ordered mild, and sweet heat. Neither was spicy, but that's how I like my wings. The coating / crust on the wings was a little heavier than most places, but I enjoyed the texture. It was satisfying.   As far as the mixed reviews of the customer service, all I can say is that we got the friendliest, and most attentive service I have had in a long time.  I asked for a few special requests (all flats & well done on some of the wings). They got it right, and were happy to do so.    We will be returning here for more wings in the future!",

    "text": "We were pleased to see a wing joint open up in the near vicinity of our home. This used to be the home of Guthrie's Chicken and although my husband was a fan, I was not sad to see it go. After reading some reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I do like the fact that you can place your order ahead of time through the eat24 website, in addition to having a drive thru if you're feeling extra lazy or are on the go. My complaint about their menu on the eat24 website is that there is no description of the wing sauce flavors. So I can choose the \"voodoo\" flavor, but what is it? In any case, we opted for six voodoo wings, six hot and sweet, and an order of garlic parmesan bayou bites (boneless). The voodoo is suppose to be a mix of sriracha and soy sauce, but it did not have too much flavor. Hot and sweet was kind of like mango habanero at BWW with much less heat. The bayou bites flavor was good but they were super greasy.  I think the price point is right for the mass produced on the go wings -- it is $4.99 for six wings. The sides they offer are pretty limited and to the point consisting of fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw. I would rate this joint well below Buffalo Wild Wings in flavor and quality, but are a decent option if you are on the go and are craving some wings.",

    "text": "Maybe it's because Vegas is flooded with subpar chains like B-dubs & Wing Stop, but if you ask me, it's hard to find consistently good wings in this city. So, when I saw VooDoo Wings opening only about 10 minutes away, it hit the top of the bookmark list pretty quick. We've now been here a couple times and I've got mixed feelings...  First of all, this location is hit and miss. If you've been in the area before, you've probably seen this particular spot go through a few business changes. The most recent was Guthrie's, who didn't last long at all. Aside from what looks like a fresh coat of paint and some new wall decor, the place hasn't changed much. It's nice to see they kept the drive thru though, since there's definitely very few places with wings who have one. My biggest gripe is much like businesses before it, VooDoo seems to be having issues keeping the place clean. On both our visits, we walked into a nearly empty restaurant with several tables visibly dirty. And considering the amount of staff behind the counter each time, I don't quite get how that happens.  As far as the menu goes, it's obviously just mainly wings and sides. The wings are offered as what I guess you can call personal size, with orders of 6, 9, or 12. Then they also have large orders in 24, 48, 75 and 100. There's also about 10 sauces to choose from and a handful or so of sides available. The pricing is pretty dang reasonable, and for just over $2, you can even make the smaller wing orders a combo that includes both a side and drink. I also like that VooDoo includes both celery, carrots and a dipping sauce in the advertised price.   So, now that I've been here a couple times, I've been able to try a couple different sauces. While most of them are pretty standard, they do offer a couple sort of unique flavors. The first is their \"Voodoo\" sauce, which they describe as a mix of Sriracha and soy sauce. I ended up ordering this flavor on both my visits, and sadly it tasted different each time. The first time it was way too sweet, the second it was mostly just heat, and even though I love Sriracha, it just wasn't the right flavor. They also have a \"Sweet Heat\" flavor which is a bit similar to BWW's Asian Zing, and as it's name suggests, is a good balance of both sweet and spicy flavors. But the biggest problem I've had with VooDoo, and all their sauces, is they just put way too much on them. Every time I finish eating, there's still a pool of sauce sitting at the bottom of the boat. The flavors are good, and I like the sauces, but just not enough to where I want to feel like I'm drinking it when I eat the wings.  I've also noticed on both our visits that a few of the wings seem to get undercooked. Each time, there was at least 1 or 2 wings in the orders that were at the stage where it's probably safely edible, but just not tasty edible. The meat was still kind of gooey and limp. I ended up having to throw them away because they were just too hard to eat. Aside from those though, the rest of the wings were very decent. I'll just be ordering mine well done from now on. And for a fast food style joint, the sides are pretty solid. I have no complaints for any of the things we tried (fried pickles, french fries & coleslaw).  Overall, VooDoo is definitely a welcome addition to what's available in town. The food is decent, it's priced right and it's always nice to have another choice for wings. I'll definitely be returning at some point, but they aren't doing anything well enough to stop my search for consistently good wings in Vegas.",

The two different flavors were thoughtfully separated by foil.  Both flavors were delicious and very tender.  The potato salad was great and had lots of additions, sort of like a \"loaded baked potato\".  The sweet tea was perfect. One of the servers checked on me and made sure all was to my liking.

I ordered take out, the staff was really nice and welcoming, the wings are fresh and don't taste froze. I have had better garlic parmesan flavor, medium flavor and ranch but it was worth the try they were not nasty the wing itself is very tasty. My experience was great, i just wouldn't go here as my first choice, if the sauces were better definitely yes, the wing itself is so juicy and tender.",

    "text": "What's going on guys! Welcome back to another review of Winging It! This review is strictly for the wings....nothing else! Not the service, not the cleanliness of the establishment, just WINGS! I always base my reviews on 4 crucial points on what I think makes a great wing....GREAT!  1. Tenderness: Definitely there. I don't like gooey, stringy chicken. It was cooked just right. Not too tough nor gooey.  2. Crispiness: Unfortunately the crisp I was looking for was not there. The only crisp that was on the chicken was around the area where the meat is thinner [on top & bottom of flats & drumsticks]; nonetheless, still delicious.   3. Size: I like my wings medium-large on a meat to bone ratio & they had plenty of meat on them thick thighs. Just enough meat for a man/woman on mission.  4. Sauce: One of the most important in my opinion! You can't go light on the sauce & you cant get lost in the sauce! Don't ever get lost in the sauce! Not an overwhelming amount of sauce just enough to compliment the taste of the chicken.  My overall rating of these wings are a 4.0 but I'm going to add half a pont for the crispy, unique shaped fries & creamy slaw turning that rating into a 4.5. Everything was pretty damn good & I cant wait to try them again. Please go try them sometime & remember not to get lost in the sauce!  Last but not least, these wings get the title: \"The Comeback Wings\" because after you try them you want to keep coming back for more.  It ain't no thang but a chicken wing. Peace!",

The flavor variety offered here is limited. I typically like to go for lemon pepper and a spicy sweet flavor but I have not found one I love here yet. Also the super spicy option has no love in it. It just burns like hell but not in a good way. The flavor is muted, so not really edible or enjoyable at all.   The curly fries here aren't that great either, they are always packaged in such a way that they arrive sogged beyond repair and the seasoning is basic. Go for the fried pickles, they do them well here.   But I do have to say their ranch is good, which is hard to come by.",

We waited over 15 mins for them to take our order. I knew they could still hear us our engine isn't quite. The car didn't move I know they could still hear it. We were patient because we get it was national chicken wing day and we freaking love this place. Andre is the name on my receipt, and he was very UNapologetic. Acting like he didn't just waste 30 mins of our time at this point. No cars were in the drive thru but yes the lobby was busy. We get it but for you to be so unapologetic after ignoring us is really irritating. After just getting off work and just wanting to pick up some dinner this experience ruined this place for me.

Of course, I have enough will power to wait until the next visit rather than ordering another five or nine wings... they are pretty modest sized so there's that. I always get the original buffalo and have tried a few of their other sauces such as Voodoo.  Fries are more like chips. Still pretty good. Also, the ice there is the nugget ice that is so pleasurable to crunch on so I go for the refills, heavy on the ice! This may be my go to place for wings in Vegas - there were a few places in North Vegas that may be comparable but I haven't tried them enough to make a proper comparison.",

    "text": "I've tried this place numerous times, and it's usually hit or miss with either quality, flavor, or service.  RARELY does it work out to be all three deserving of 4 stars or more.  Granted, we have pretty strict needs when ordering, meaning one wants well done, another wants all flats (which they charge extra for), and another wants more than one flavor, etc.  I get it, we're picky!  Honestly, there's only been one time they've messed up our order completely, and that was in the drive up window, so given that, I can't say how much more clear our order could have been conveyed...   - anyways -   As for customer service, it seems there's always someone new at the counter or in the drive thru.  All for equal opportunity, but I'm wondering if they hire family and friends first?  What's with the tiny too tight jeans and the 4ft cellphone sticking out of the back pocket?  Seems it's a fashion statement - because I've seen more than one employee here with that same \"style\" - maybe I'm just too old?    Or, pet peeve, hair everywhere and unwashed hands after handling money/bank cards?  I almost said something last time I was there and watched the person behind the counter literally serve someone, go to the back, take a bite of food with bare hands after handling cash, then return to the counter while chewing food, handle more cash, and serve up food on the platters to give to patrons seated.  Pretty sure if I'm asked to go there again and see similar, I'll probably have a hard time keeping my mouth shut about food safety, health department requires a food handlers card - which I KNOW covers when to wash your hands, etc.  Also, the place used to be SPOTLESS when they first opened, and now it's hard to find a place to sit that isn't tacky from previous patrons and poor cleaning skills.",

After typing that,  I want to say I'm surprised I even ate here after ordering. The older woman taking orders is sick. Sick coughing into her hands and towards everything. She gave us our drinks after she coughed on her hands.  Yuck  The place smells when you walk in; and doesn't smell good.  Smells like old moldy bleach.  It's pretty clean inside but rundown and needs some repair and a little care.   With the woman being sick around food was my first removal of a star and the next two stars upsets me the most.  So while we were ordering I had a conversation with this woman taking our orders about the combo meals. My son ordered fries and a drink and my husband ordered a 12 count combo meal(to share) with a drink and potato salad. I even talk to the woman about the size and said I'll have potato salad.  We finish ordering our food and pay them. The woman hands us two cups for the two combo meals we ordered.  The young girl brings out our food and we notice we don't have the potato salad I ordered With our meal. We go up to get it and she tells us we didn't order a combo. We also realize we didn't get a receipt.  They were so rude about it. Trying to make us feel like we were idiots.  Needless to say, the customer service is terrible and is the reason why we won't ever be back!!",

They have updated their menu and now have specials that include wings, and sides. I chose the \"Take It To The House\" special which is 24 wings, one large side (fries, but potato salad and slaw are options as well), and carrots and celery sticks. I also added on an order of fried pickles.   The flavors I went with were: lemon pepper teriyaki hot garlic parm  I was in and out within 10 minutes, despite there being 2 cars in front of me. All of the food was still hot and crispy when I got home too. The wings are a decent size and come crispy, just how I like them. The teriyaki and lemon pepper flavors are personal favs. The garlic parm are too garlicky for me, but I had some anyway and had garlic breath for days. The fried pickles were really good, crunchy and sour with a side of ranch to dip them in. My only gripe is they put the ranch in the same container and it got warm from the heat of the hot pickles. I am glad I gave them another try and would not hesitate to get wings from here again.",

Ordered 24 pieces, the cashier really knew her stuff, explained the differences in the flavors and told me what the top flavors were.  I had a special request, I only like wings that are normal in size.  Not the big huge ones that most people like, you know the ones that are so big it looks like a chicken leg, but its supposed to be a wing.  No problem, she put in that request for me, smaller sized wings only.  I am very pleased, I got the garlic parmesan, mild and the lemon pepper!  Wow, it was fresh and so GOOD!  I am sad to say that I went to a wing stop location earlier in the day and wasted $$, the wings were hard, and had no seasoning, since I did not feel like taking the drive down to Voodoo, wont make that mistake again.  This is the top wing place to go.  Will be back again, real soon.",

One hot one Garlic Parmesan one with fries the other with pickles. Now I am usually a hot wings guy myself and the hot wings where great but I was amazed by how damn good the Garlic Parmesan were. The fried pickles are great! Love em!  The fries, well not sure but I'll give them another go. As for service well, Laney was working the register and she is great.  She also checked in on us to see that we were doing ok when she would bring out other people's food and from what I could tell the other staff was of the same mentality. Looking forward to going back and trying out the Bomb and seeing what kind of heat it has for a sauce. See you soon!",

    "text": "Voodoo Wing Co. is a wonderful wing spot that I had wondered about for way too long.  I hadn't really heard any buzz about VooDoo so it was time for The Bruiser to investigate for himself. Before you walk into the New Orleans French Quarter motif, the amazing aroma of the flavorful wings slaps you in the face and pulls you right in. There are several flavors of wings. I went with the Sweet Heat & The Bomb. Sweet Heat is a mix of soy sauce & siracha. It was simply delicious. The Bomb on the other hand is a story by itself. For any of you brave souls that like heat.....this is the flavor for you! The Bomb is a blend of ghost pepper chilis and some type of scorpion pepper chilis and it was the hottest thing I have ever eaten!!! Extreme heat but so magnificently delicious at the same time. Here's a tip if you choose this flavor... keep a lot of water close by and don't chase it with soda because it will intensify the burn. If you have any type of congestion ... it will be cured after one bite! I also recommend the fried pickles, they are very tasty. So, if you're looking for a great wing spot off the busy Strip drop by VooDoo Wing Co.....order The Bomb... if you dare.",

They give generous portions of food, with each order. My top favorite sauces for the wings, 1. BOMB, (be careful, the bomb is VERY spicy, and it's not meant for the weak taste buds) 2. MANGO JABANERO.  Their french fries are my favorite. Always made just the way I like it. I'm addicted to this place, I'll drive any distance to get there.   I've recommended a lot of my friends to go here, they have ALL loved it. We all used to go to Buffalo Wild Wings, but this place has much better wings, & way better pricing.  The experience is great, each time. It's a tiny place, but there's a reason why everybody continues to go there.   If you've been considering giving this place a shot, you know I'm going to say, absolutely. Give this place a shot, & I'm sure you won't regret it. :)",

We decided to dine in, and the young lady said she would bring our food as soon as it was ready. Once she brought our food I realized she had forgot our ranch no big deal except she only gave me one and I ask for another since we had two meals. She explained that would cost extra, so I ask then why would you ask if I wanted ranch when I ordered. She ended up giving it to me at no extra cost. I was just a little annoyed by that. The wings were nice and hot and had plenty of meat. And I was pleasantly surprised that the boneless wings were so tasty!! Normally I stay away from boneless because they are breaded so much and there's no meat; but not here!! I was a little disappointed to find the French fries were hot since the wings seemed to be so fresh. And next time if your not going to clean your celery at least cut off the dirty parts before serving to costumers. Thank god I didn't see the dirt until I was basically done eating or that would have ruined my appetite, seeing how they were on the side of my wings. Over all decent place I will be back to try again.",

Went to the drive thru to get a simple order of wings and fried pickles. Let's start with the drive thru lady ignoring me when she handed me my food as I stated I'm pretty sure this isn't my order. She ignored me and closed the window. I had to knock on the window. She argued with me and told me she didn't have time for this. I said my order is wrong. She did not want to deal with it and wanted me to wait. She didn't want to hear what was wrong so finally I got her to listen.. The Order was wrong so the lady at the drive thru gave me horrible attitude when I stated she gave me the wrong wings that these were not garlic Parmesan which was obvious from smell and sight of a very spicy looking wing that was given to me instead. She slammed the dive thru window closed in my face so I had to go in after she was very rude and said she didn't have time to help me with my wrong order!!! By the time I had to come in after I got literally yelled at for them messing up my order!!! While in their the lady in the counter says they messed up both their orders too! The drive thru lady slammed my correct wings on the counter so at that point I said give me a refund I don't want them so she gave me my money and offered me the wings but I could tell they were under cooked so I left them on the counter. I wasn't going to consume under cooked chicken. Wings don't get done in 2 minutes! I did try the fried pickles. Waste of 2 dollars. All it was was corn meal on some pickles. The grease is too heavy and tasted old and dirty and the order was just blah. Waste of time money and terrible experience. Do not waste your time trying this horrible place. Customer service is horrible and they didn't even make her apologize to me even though she threw down the wings on the counter in front of a customer at the drive thru and everyone inside. This place will never make it treating customers the way I was treated! And what I tasted was lacking!",

I like super hot food and the Bomb is not for the weak at heart.   Very cool concept and I wanted to buy a shirt or cap but the manager/owner? Told me they will have them for purchase soon.       I'm hooked and they definitely have a loyal customer now.    The drive thru takes a few but it's worth the wait to get good wings in a drive thru.",

Cashier is okay could be better but it is almost 9 so she's probably tired. I got three different flavors mango habanero, Cajun ranch and garlic parmesan. I am very picky on mango habanero with that being said I would not recommend it here . Know for the Cajun ranch those wings have a flavor that just explode when you bit into it very good. Garlic parmesan was very good not the best but a must try. Fries for me had to much salt but where okay. Do not try the potato salad it was so bad my daughter almost throw up. Know I am a firm believer that ranch should be home made, I don't think they make it here the ranch tasted like a generic Kraft. Know I honestly would give a three star if it wasn't for the Cajun ranch wings.",

Living around this location Buffalo Wild Wings is a bit far from me so I was trying to find something in the neighborhood and I found this gem. The next two times after that I felt like the food was kind of slacking. The wings felt like they were over done and I was starting to lose faith. After a few weeks I went back and it felt like the first time all over again. I honestly feel like I come here every week which is kind of bad because ya know fast food and all but this place is irresistible! I always get the garlic Parmesan wings and this are the best garlic Parmesan wings I have tasted. If you're ever in the are definitely stop in and check this place out!",

The fried pickles here and plentiful and AMAZINGLY crunchy. The Bomb flavor was really spicy which I like. the mango habanero didn't taste like mango or habanero to me, but it was still really tasty. Sidewinder fries were awesome and I believe they make their own ranch which is always a plus.",

They are serviceable however. It's also worth noting that the wait time was a slight irritation. For a reasonably small order it took roughly fifteen minutes to get the food. The chicken itself tastes okay. My biggest problem is the amount of grease on the chicken itself. There was a sizable collection of grease at the bottom of the container when I opened it.

I oredered 9 wings and a side of fries the price came out to about $12 and some change. Good price I would say. I ordered my wings extra crispy; all flats. The wings are not very saucey when you get the actually dry. I don't like my wings tasting fatty, but they did. I had to pay an additional $.81 for a side of sauce because my wings are dry. The fries, hmmm I would pass the taste like the fries you can cook at home. Overall, I will not recommend this place I would say stick to Wingstop!",

Apparently their bomb flavor was featured on a food network show called Heat Seekers, and if you love hot, this flavor is incredibly hot! We love it though.

Cant pass a up a good opportunity to check out a new place.  First off, I must say that their establishment is pretty nice sized compared to other wing joints I have been to. Secondly, they have a decent sized flat screen monitor so you can watch the big game if it applies.   As for the wings, their menu set up is simple. You pick how many wings you want. 6 - $5.29  9 - $7.59 12 - $9.89 24 - $19.49 48 - $37.99 100 - $74.99  Then you pick your sauce. The Bomb Mango Habanero Hot VooDoo Mild Lemon Pepper Sweet Heat Garlic Parmesan Teriyaki Bbq  Then pick your dipping sauce. Ranch Blue Cheese  Add fries and a drink to make it a combo for $2.89 more.  Sure they have other things like Bayou Bites (boneless chicken) along with Cole Slaw, Fried Pickles, and Potato Salad, and extra Veggies as sides.  So what I got was the 12 piece combo half lemon pepper half Sweet heat to play it safe because I wasnt so sure about the bomb or voodoo sauce since there is mixed opinions on it. Shared this with my wife so I wouldnt look like a pig.  The Lemon Pepper was good just like all other places. Cant really mess that up unless you use really old lemon pepper seasoning as I have experienced at a certain place. The Sweet Heat was pretty good. More sweet than anything and not much heat. I think they put way too much sauce on it though. I guess thats better than hardly any sauce like another place. For both flavors it seems like they dip the wings in butter after pulling it out of the fryer for the bottom of my container had a yellowish puddle. The fries were bland, even with salt. Note to the owner, I think it would be awesome if you can have the option of having the fries seasoned with any of your sauces or dry rubs. As for the drink, they put too much ice in it. So a couple sips and you're done. At least they give you veggies to go with your wings.  Service was weird. And by weird I mean they dont really listen to some of your requests. Like when I ask for a refill and they ask if I want more ice I say no but they proceed to put more ice in it anyway. So then I feel bad for having to come up to the counter every 90 seconds to ask for a refill. Other than that they take your order and bring it out to you.  Overall, lets just say im not in any rush to come back here any time soon.  Yelp 2015 Review #24 \"Who want that VooDoo? Me? Maybe\" 522 overall",

Went in apprehensive but was quickly wowed by great service, and happily discovered my new favorite wing joint!  Not many sauce choices, but all the flavors I've tried have been good. Voodoo: sriracha+soy, surprisingly good! Garlic parm: strong garlic flavor, my new favorite. Lemon pepper: this version is a dry rub with some oil. Hot & Sweet: like a mango habanero elsewhere, not too spicy.  Wing are good-sized and meaty, unlike my experiences with other wing chains. Menu also has sides like fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw, but the service is top-notch! Friendly staff at the register remembered my name and order after a single visit, always super cheerful. They do have a drive-thru available.",

We ordered wings for the VGK game and bc we had children eating the wings we ordered them with sauces on the side and when it was delivered all the wings had bbq sauce all over everything. And other sauces on the side... 70$ down the drain bc no one ate them. And we ended up going and ordering other food. My husband who likes bbq sauce didn't even enjoy them bc they had so much sauce. Oh well, we filed a complaint with the service we ordered from and we received nothing from them or the company. Live and learn!",

The wings are very delicious they're big wings not the cheesy little pizza place wings. The customer service was friendly and attentive. they have great flavors to put on them. I got mine plane with my flavor on the side. I had the lemon pepper butter, medium hot, and sweet Heat and it comes with blue cheese or Ranch. I really like their fries they were kind of Twisted fat wedges very unique and very Hardy for a french fry I really like this place and I will definitely be coming here for more wings. It was better than Wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings",

We came on Monday after work and went through the drive thru due to the crazy weather and my laziness. They have a decent menu, which includes the typical wings, fries, and fried pickles; as well as buffalo bites and other offerings.  We got the 12 piece in mild 10.99ish, an order of fries, and an order of fried pickles. The wings were delicious! I love that they're fried and not just blah and baked. The fries were just ok, for 1.89 the serving is actually small and they're a little limpy, and the fried pickles were missing seasoning or something, for 2.39 they're not bad (I'm a big fan of BWW fried pickles! but these are not the same) I wish they would make a separate dipping sauce, like a spicy ranch for the FP.   We spent about $17 for the meal, which was pretty ok. The customer service is cool for a drive thru, they were very nice. We liked the wings, so we would probably go back for them.  Yay!",

Same goes for the traditional, nice & crisp on the outside & tender on the inside. Should've added a bit more Garlic Parmesan, flavor was light but still not disappointing. They're fries were great, some kind of W shaped fries never seen before by me but man were they good. Maybe a little more ranch but I understand food cost. Will definitely return!",

Drive-thru experience at about 9pm was good, took some time for the chicken to be done but it was cooked perfectly and mild sauce is tasty, this trip prompted a second trip the next day only this time we decided to dine in, this is where it all goes wrong. We ordered a 12piece wing combo which came with a tather small fry and for a 20 cent upcharge to get the 32oz drink total price cane out to be approx $15. We ordered mild again and garlic parm, the garlic parm was just a butter sauce with parm cheese shook over it. The interior or the place looked like it was in ruins not to mention their exhaust may not be the best because we left the building smelling like chicken, I've never walked out of BWW or wingstop smelling like food. The sanitation there could not be up to code, I  witnessed an associate on the phone texting i also witnessed an associate eating food behind the counter as well everyone didnt have on a hair net. I asked for extra mild sauce and they wanted to charge me  .81 for a 2oz sauce. Ill never go inside to eat again and i doubt if i order chicken from there again due to the uncleanliness of the place overall. If i was the owner of this establishment I would most certainly move to a smaller place and use the money im saving to take pride in my establishment by simply doing a deep clean and a nice paint job.",

    "text": "Their sauces are no joke, not only does the bomb bring the heat but has a nice amount of flavor. I wasn't up to the challenge today, but soon. Chose their voodoo sauce after a sample and this has a decent heat but packed with deliciousness. I'll update my review after another visit or two but so far I'm impressed with the food and the service.",
