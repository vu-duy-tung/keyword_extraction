I ordered a Caesar Salad with grilled shrimp and then shared the Steamed Clams.  The Caesar Salad lettuce seemed fresh enough, but the dressing was not the appetizing and the shrimp were dry and overcooked.  I don't see this being my choice next time we are looking for a good meal in Downtown Summerlin.",

    "text": "This is more of a comparison between Grape Street Cafe (downtown Summerlin) and Grape Vine Cafe (Buffalo & Lake Mead).  I have been going to Grape Vine for years (back when it used to be Grape Street).  My staple lunch is the steak salad with the meat cooked to the chef's recommendation (which is usually medium to medium-rare).    Today I ventured out to downtown Summerlin and quickly ordered the same thing.  Let me tell you that Grape Street's version was average at best.  I'll summarize my dislikes: 1) Quality of meat was lacking.  It was a tougher steak and the seasoning lacked any flavor. 2) Too much blue cheese.  I don't mind blue cheese, however there is no need for the excessive amount that was placed on the salad.   3) The quantity of meat was much less than the place on Buffalo & Lake Mead. 4) The bread was hard.  The crust of the bread was very crunchy... not as soft & fresh as it normally is.   5) The meat was overcooked (unless the chef recommends that the steak be cooked well-done - which seems odd).    In summary, if I'm heading to lunch and these are my two options, I would recommend you go to the original with a different name.  Grape Vine Cafe is much tastier than the fancier brother.",

We had the Bread Pudding and Profiteroles (we were in the mood for dessert).  Also had a couple cups of coffee.  The first round of coffee was cold so our server brought us fresh cups of hot coffee and had them comped off the bill.  The desserts were delectable and I highly recommend the bread pudding as it is difficult to get it just right, but the Grape Street Cafe nailed it.  My wife rather enjoyed her dessert as well which was basically cream puffs on steroids with way more flavor.  Great ambiance so I look forward to heading back for dinner. Five stars, thanks Grape Street.",

    "text": "Good meal with a beautiful atmosphere!   I grew up dining at the Lake Mead location, so when I heard Grape Street opened up a new spot in Downtown Summerlin, I decided to check it out for lunch.  Here's the breakdown:  Food: Good. Same wonderful menu as their original location. I ordered the Steak Salad and it was pretty solid. I ordered my steak medium rare; however, it was still slightly undercooked. My boyfriend ordered the Goat Cheese Bowtie pasta. He thought it was okay. He noted it lacked flavor.   Atmosphere: Beautiful! The new location has a gorgeous bar, lovely lighting, big windows, tall ceilings, and a combination of tables in the center of the restaurant and cozy leather chairs tucked away in romantic corners.   Bar: Even though we didn't order any spirits, beer, or wine, my boyfriend (a bourbon/whiskey/scotch connoisseur) spotted that the bar had a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon. Needless to say, he was impressed.   Prices: Just right. Not too over priced. Our meal was $30.  Service: We were served by Nick. He was great. There when we needed him and not there when we didn't.  Grape Street is always a solid choice and this new location is certainly much more modern and classy than their original spot. I would definitely come back for dinner and sample some cocktails!",

The dining room was near capacity and the high noise level made conversation challenging. The menu at both restaurants are similar. As of this visit a Happy Hour is not yet available. On this evening it was a cold night and the outside air could be felt every time the door opened. This situation should be short lived.  The wait staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. The Blacken Salmon Caesar salad is served with hearts of romaine, oranges and pineapples with a Caesar dressing. It was a perfect size portion and cooked exactly as ordered.  This location is another great addition to the choices at Downtown Summerlin. I look forward to dining on the outdoor patio along with a Happy Hour menu.",

I love the original location (now owned by new owners and called Grape Vine Cafe), so after our movie we thought we would go in to try Grape Street.  We ordered almost the same items we had eaten at Grape Vine just over a week ago and what a disappointing difference!  The bread was absolutely horrible - heavy, stale and old (we had eaten two loaves of Grape Vine's bread because it was so yummy!).  My salmon was dry, bland and overcooked, my husband's tuna was gray and definitely not fresh.  We couldn't even get anyone's attention to get our food remade (seems like the staff was more interested in partying at the bar), so we just paid the bill and left.  We will stick to the original location on Lake Mead and Buffalo...we should have known better, it seems the original of anything is always better!",

In the restaurant's defense, this definitely hurt our experience.   Service: - Got seated within 5 minutes - Got drinks and bread quickly - Waiter was very nice and polite - Delay between salad and dinner was VERY long (too long) - Delay between dinner and dessert was terribly long. - Delay between dessert and getting the check was even longer. I couldn't find our waiter and he came back in reeking of smoke from his smoke break.  Food: - Bread and whipped butter was simple but delicious - Both my Caesar salad and wife's house salad were chopped (love it) but EXTREMELY \"oniony\" despite there being no onions in the salad!  It was WAYYYY overpowering and left a terrible onion aftertaste that I still have hours later. And I love onion! - My wife's chicken Parmesan was tasty but pretty basic. My filet Oscar (filet mignon, mashed potato, asparagus, crab leg, bearnaise sauce, and wine reduction) was just ok. Everything we ate had an excessive amount of parsley sprinkled on it. For the price of the dishes.....ehhhh. - Dessert: 3 profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate, caramel, and raspberry sauce. It was \"just ok\" unfortunately.  Desserts were priced reasonably at $8   Price: More than it was worth For the two of us (bottle of sparkling water, one soft drink, two entrees, and one dessert........$96.24 with tip. Like I said, more than I thought it was worth.   OVERALL RATING???: 6.5 out of 10 stars  Would I go back? Maybe with friends if they wanted to go but probably not.b",

    "text": "I will say for a 15 minute drop in this had to be the worst experience ever.  So a buddy of mine and I originally went to grape street bar to get some drinks and pu my wife food to take home but the bar was packed. No biggie. We headed to Andiron which our bartender Renee was amazing. Then we decided to just get one more drink and pu my wife the linguini and clam sauce to take home. The second we grabbed a seat at the bar Samantha our bartender asked what we wanted. I ordered a Manhattan on the rocks and my buddy ordered a Belvedere on the rocks plus the clam sauce to go. Right after she placed the drinks near us wo us noticing she proceeds to take birthday shots with other staff members. Then the clam sauce comes out on a plate. We let them know it's to go and about 10 minutes later in comes in a to go container. During this time I am trying to get Samantha's attn to get my check but her birthday shots seemed to be more important. Once I get the check not even a thank you or thanks for coming.  I look at the check they charged $3 to \"prep my Manhattan\" on top of the drink charge and then they charge $2 for ice for the belvedere. I get it the place is packed and they can get away with bad service and charging for ice.  I'm just very disappointed since I loved the Grape Street in Lake Mead for so long my wife even had her baby shower there. I will not say I won't go back because I have friends that love the single scene there. I just won't go back by my choice. I even Hope our bartender reads this and improves her service",

We decided to start at the bar this time and have a couple cocktails before indulging in food. my wife had a special mojito, and i had a drink called the painkiller both were amazing. Bina took good care of us and the bar was pretty busy the whole time. This time we went appetizer tasting and had the burratta, calamari, and clams, they were also delicious. We live pretty close to the restaurant and the wife has agreed that we have found our new come to spot.",

    "text": "We were waiting for this place to open only to be highly disappointed. First and LAST time we will ever attempt to have dinner or any other meal here. Awful and overcrowded with some of the worst wait queue organization skills from any restaurant we have ever been to. After waiting for over 90 minutes (from being told a 30-45 minute wait time) and then being told we're 10-15 minutes away from being seated which actually lasted for another 35 minutes, and having 2 parties jump ahead of us, we were finally seated. They had this loud and obnoxious party happening which prevented anyone from getting a table because of them clogging up the walk areas and bar area only to find out that NONE of the actual party guests were even sitting in their 20+ seats and tables! A server finally made his way to us but it turned out that he wasn't even our actual server and was helping the server assigned to our area who we never saw because he was dealing with that party. There was also some unkempt wine gopher that kept dealing with what looked like people he knew or were financially better off than most. After placing our order we sat there and my wife made me realize the amount of food we ordered and how much it would cost for our drinks, 2 appetizers, and dinner entrees which was over $110. For us, it doesn't matter how much the food costs at a restaurant as long as it tastes good and the experience is welcoming and rewarding. But did we want to spend that much after such a terrible experience? HELL NO! So we flagged down our surrogate server, cancelled our orders, and got up and left.  I really hope they get their act together and provide a better dining experience for future guests.",

I could have taken being ignored for a few minutes while they were serving someone dessert and laughing over and rifling through a purse that was found at the bar (black clutch/crossbody possibly Coach has gum in it lol!) anyway... When the girl was done tapping the register and I thought she was going to actually turn to me and say hi (8 minutes in) she ACTUALLY started texting on her cell phone!  at this point I hoped up and said DONE! I don't need to beg anyone to take my $14 for a \"summerlin margarita\" terrible name BTW! My husband attempted to tell the poor host and he seemed lost and I was over it. Will not be back even though the poor manager with a deer in headlights stare offers to \"help\" us...my advice on the way out the door...cut that bartender she's a huge liability! I'm all for having fun behind a bar but when someone comes in and is willing to shell out $13 for a cocktail you stop what you are doing and charge them! perhaps your star rating will go to at least a 3...oh well walked right over to Public School and was welcomed with open arms and p.s. There too drink is $9...",

    "text": "The food here was good, the waiter we had was excellent. The price for lunch was reasonable. However, the experience was tainted by an EXTREMELY rude person working there. Not sure if he was a manager or server but wow, what an snarky 'tude on that one. Backstory, arrived with wife and baby -- noticed an empty patio table. Asked the hostess for that table. She said it needed to be cleared but no problem .. \"wait 2 minutes\" .. then she disappears. Literally 10 minutes later and still that table was not cleared and we're just waiting ... in comes the guy in question asking if we've been helped (which was a good start, to his credit) .. when I recapped the situation, pointed out the empty table and said we had been waiting for the hostess .. he snapped back with \"we appreciate patience\" (said in a very rude tone). I was surprised and pretty much bit my tongue (I have worked in restaurants and know how some of these guys will seek out \"revenge\" -- better to file it away for yelp readers).   GSC: yes you were busy, but you won't be in the future if this kind of treatment of your customers becomes the norm. The guy's response would have been fine with the appropriate tone (polite, apologetic) vs turning it around on me. After the \"encounter\" they should have offered a free beverage or whatever to smooth things over (it was tense as we were seated).   Food was good, waiter was very good .. but the brush up with your other employee made it a two star experience. You can't be a dick to customers and think that the encounter doesn't leave the walls of your establishment and will not come back to bite you -- not in 2015. If it were me I would have offered some item that costs them $2 or less and it would have shown me something and I would have left a much more positive review.",

The whole restaurant can hear due to the exhibition kitchen. Very embarrassing for a business owner to have your PAYING customers feel awkward in your own restaurant.",

Our waiter was Randy...it took him a while to acknowledge us and  introduce himself (I realize it may have been busy so we gave him a pass). We ordered two drinks and 2 appetizers. The appetizers came out way before the drinks which is ridiculous. How long does it take to make the drinks? Oh yeah, our waiter was too busy chatting with the table next to us. After a while we noticed that every table around us had a basket of bread...At this point our dining experience was already ruined so when we asked Randy for the bread, instead of getting an apology we got a handful of attitude. The bread came with our main entrees. We enjoyed the pasta dishes and the appetizers but couldn't wait to leave. It is always disappointing when lack of service overshadows the quality of food. I hope our note on the receipt and a subpar tip made Randy feel as unimportant as his service made us feel.",

Sent it back, hot one came out. Less than 5 minutes later, server says our entrees are ready. We ask them if they can be held until we finish our appetizers. About 15 minutes later, 1 of our 3 entrees came out. All appetizer plates and dirty dishes are left on the table. 15 minutes later, I get up to ask where our other 2 entrees are......manager apologizes, says they're on their way. They finally come out 10 minutes after THAT, and he says he'll take them off the check. Thank goodness because the steak was wayyyy overcooked, and the pizza was missing a topping that we asked for. I order a second glass of wine.....the server brings it over and pours what's left of my first glass into my new glass!!!!! Wow. I was pretty speechless at this point. Won't be going back here again.",

We sat there for over 10 minutes before RJ, the better bartender, finally served us our wine. This poor guy was carrying the team. Carl, who seemed wasted, was dropping bottles, asking us what we had to drink for our tab when we literally ordered 2 minutes right before, and had no clue what he was doing. When we ordered a round of shots with friends, they were all different amounts in buckets glasses and Martini glasses, wtf??? This guy either has no clue what he was doing, or my guess WASTED. A guest next to us, asked for their check and he said he didn't have one. He then proceeded AGAIN to ask what they had to drink to start them a tab. What a joke. Find a replacement. Carl was bad enough to ruin it even though RJ and the Barback were great.",

The 2 stars are due to the terrible service.The first time we went, we sat out on the patio. The waitress was attentive and checked on us often. The second time we went on 4/27 around lunch time, the patio was full so we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender Courtney was horrible. She acted like us being there was an inconvenience to her. She basically stood in a corner and ignored us the whole time. I asked her a question and all she said was \"yes\" and walked away. I honestly thought bartenders were supposed to be friendlier than that. There were also 2 ladies sitting next to us and for the whole 1.5 hours we were there I never saw her talk to them to even ask if they needed refills or anything.  All of a sudden 2 guys walk in and she goes to their side of the bar and all she does the whole time is chat with them while showing them pictures on her phone and totally neglecting us. She never came back to our side after that. I even wanted another glass of wine but couldn't get her attention. When she came to get our plates we got a chance to ask for the check and got out of there..I've never been treated like that at a bar before and I was very <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshocked.it&s=450b321c2ef957ba49ea23d0c73fe8725f6b1f22ddf4468931852dc2ba451c48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shocked.it</a> was an epic fail on the bartender's part.

It's easily accessible by parking on the east side of the mall by Regal or Dillards. The ambiance was on point- rustic yet colorful, casual yet chic. But!, it's another restaurant with tables a little too close for comfort. If they remove even 2 tables & spread the rest of the tables out a bit, they'll be golden. Our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable & the right level of attentive. & pretty easy on the eyes. The complimentary bread wasn't super flavorful but it was soft & the whipped butter was good. At the waiter's suggestion, I ordered the Portobello philly with chicken added & my lunch dates ordered the chicken parm sandwich & the steak salad. The philly came with some sort of cold rice pilaf salad... I have no idea what it was but it was simple & I seemed to enjoy it. The philly was fantastic- the bread for both sandwiches was the same as the complimentary bread & was the perfect sandwich bread. It even held up reheating the next day! The verdict on the chicken parm sandwich was \"really good\". & the fries were highly rated by all of us. We both tasted the steak salad- the general consensus was that it's yummy. But!, the salad could use a bit more substance with mushrooms or croutons, etc. It seemed a bit like a generic side salad with steak on it. It doesn't do the steak justice. All in all, it was a lovely experience & I'll definitely return.",

We order two variations of the steak..this is where you have to bear with me.  I had the wasabi something which had a nice little kick to it!  The mashed potatoes were perfect (i love mashed potatoes lol) The other variation was the steak with, i want to say, a brandywine? reduction of some kind. We were stuffed!  The service was great! The atmosphere is comfortable.  There was sports going on near the bar but you could barely hear it.  We were there at 730pm and didnt realize we were the only ones left and the staff was cleaning up butttt no one made a fuss that we were still there talking!!  Thanks again for a great evening!!  We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "This place was soooooo amazing!  I was so worried about coming here because of the bad reviews regarding the customer service. We had a party of 21 and one AMAZING waiter named John (of course he had support from other staff but he was the one that was taking the orders and coming back to check on us). He was soooooo attentive and went above and beyond. For example, we had two children 3 years of age, we had forgotten their apple juice and apple slices. John found an apple for us and cut it into slices for the kids. He couldn't find apple juice so he made the kids chocolate milk. They didn't have chocolate milk but he managed to create it for the kids. Totally saved the night. All the drinks (alcohol or non-alcoholic) came out super fast. We didn't even have to ask for refills because they were filling up our cups or asking us if we wanted an alcoholic drink. The food was amazing. Not sure what the food complaints were about. I had the tomato basil soup, the sea bass and Brie appetizer which was a must (it does take 20 minutes to come out but sooooo worth it. Just order it ASAP. Trust me you won't regret it). My Roomate ordered the baked penne which was a must and so delicious. I wish I had taken photos but I had left my phone behind by accident. No worries because I will definitely be coming back. I'll take the pictures the next time I come. I only have a group pic of some of us to prove we actually came. Please go in with an open mind and try to look past the bad yelp review. You will miss out on great wine and food if you do.",

I'm vegetarian, so after being warmly greeted by the friendly, bubbly hostess, we asked to see a menu to see if there was anything I could eat. We ended up sitting at the bar. Our bartender, Courtney (I think was her name), was also very warm, friendly, and attentive. He ordered a sangria, (which, I don't drink sangria but his was very good), and we split the tapas appetizer. He mentioned I'm a vegetarian, and without being asked, she offered to put the meatballs on the side, so as to not touch the other food. Food came out promptly and OMG it was delicious! I devoured the goat cheese wrap things, kalamata olives, roasted veggies, and garlic ball. And don't get me started on the tzaziki sauce it's served with.. best I've had! The menu is a bit pricey, but I totally don't mind paying extra for quality food. I can't wait to come back and try an entree! And yes, fellow vegetarians, there are choices for you!",

Made a reservation for a party of three, they did have our table ready and we were able to be seated earlier than our reserved time, but the table they gave us was a half booth, with a very small table. I am 6'6\", my brother is 6'5\", and we were so uncomfortable. Couldn't believe that was the best table available with a reservation .  I ordered the bowtie lobster special, and honestly it was terrible. I ate very little of it, complained to the waiter that I didnt care for it at all, and he didnt bother to take it off the bill, or do anything to appease us. My girlfriends Penne Ala Vodka was very mediocre, my brothers eggplant dish was just ok. They did have a good wine list, and the wine we chose was very good, but overall we were not impressed. Do not think we will be dining there again. Nora's and the Italian American Club are both much, much better.",

The lack of professionalism displayed by the owner discouraged me from ever going back to this location until my boyfriend asked me tonight to give it another shot. We were big fans of their old location so I knew the opportunity was their and was not opposed to eating there for dinner.  We're a laid back couple and decided to be casual and dine at the bar.  Once settled in, we were immediately greeted by the bartender (name on the check is Carl) and he offered menus and water. The bartender was very pleasant and efficient. He quickly answered any questions we had and before we knew it, our dinner was arriving.  I ordered the \"gluten-free\" Primavera and my bf had the chicken marsala.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and so happy I'm able to update my review to a positive experience.   Even though we weren't drinking tonight but only enjoyed dinner, our bartender showed equal service to us as he did everyone else. The bar was steady with a good crowd but that didn't keep him from taking care if us.  We will return for another visit sooner then later",

One was filled with meat and the other had about 1/2 as much and fewer toppings and the bread was a bit dried out.  Again, not a bid deal.  The iced tea was pre-sweetened, but that is a personal preference.  The trash can in the rest room was overflowing.  This is the kinda stuff the manager should be catching and directing changes.  The ingredients were all good though.  Not a bad experience and we go here once in a while but they need to take it up a level to get past three stars.",

The food was just ok, the service was horrible.  Small things like bringing out soups for 2 in our party with no spoons and having to wait to catch someone's attention, and asking for more bread, and then asking a second person who actually remembered to return with bread, and clearly telling the waiter that I could not have dairy and then getting a dish with garlic parmesan sauce.  The last straw was that I was convinced to have one of the \"specials\", 4 scallops (which I could have sworn he said were jalapeno wrapped) with some vegetables which turned out to be $49!  My mistake - but I sure feel like I was had.  What a sucker.  Well, never again.",

    "text": "The first time we ate at Grape Street was when they first opened in the 90's. The place was a hit, the food was great and the service spectacular. Today we ate at their new location in Downtown Summerlin for the second - and last - time. We were \"greeted\" by the hostess who only asked if we were a party of two. She walked to a table, tossed the menus down and walked away. Not a good start. We had water and bread if short order, but did not see our waiter for five minutes. We decided to order wine and our food at the same time so we didn't have to wait another five minutes for him to return. We ordered the Orange Chicken salad and wine. The wine showed up in about four minutes but the salad did not make it out for another 11 minutes. We attempted to eat the bread, but we needed a hacksaw to cut it into pieces, so we were only able to tear off small pieces. When the salad arrived it looked okay, but some of the ingredients were missing - specifically the peanuts. Maybe we looked like we had a peanut allergy. There were four slices of canned Mandarin orange on the rim of the bowl and a generous handful of fried wonton strips piled in the center. I counted three thin strips of red pepper and four slices of chicken. Speaking of the chicken, I thought perhaps it might be free range, but it ended up being taste free. It appeared to be grilled but there was almost no taste - but it was warm (I'm guessing from the microwave.) From the time our meal arrived until we had been sitting in front of empty plates for at least five minutes, not a single person approached our table. We were never asked if the food was good of if we wanted anything else. A manager looking person cleared our table and then we waited another five minutes before our waiter returned - the first time since taking our order - with the check. I should add that during this time there were only 11 customers in the restaurant. They were not slammed by any stretch of the imagination.  When Grape Street was born, it was fantastic. The new location is great but they forgot to bring along the great food and service.  I gave this two stars because during the few times that we had any interaction with the staff, with the exception of the hostess, they were friendly. In our book, two strikes and you are out. We are definitely out.",

I have heard many word of mouth reviews of friends who have recently dined here and some good and some iffy reviews have been made. My friends and I decided to give it a chance.  1. Atmosphere was amazing . Beautifully decorated and very well maintained. Staff was very pleasant and the wait time was 10 minutes. As we sat down we had a server by the name of Jeremy assist us and he was nothing but overly pleasant, knowledgeable and over all happy to be apart of the new restaurant.   2. Food: I have my go to items and the menu was the same as the location on Lake Mead so I decided to try something out side of my comfort zone and got the chopped salad and the Filet Oscar . Both absolutely amazing .  The time to get the food took a little longer then I would have wanted but It also could have been me being extremely not patient and starving.  Price was the same and overall I had an amazing time and enjoyed every bit of my experience of Grape Street and Downtown Summerlin.  At the end of the day just like any new establishment comes quirks and learning opportunities and I feel Grape Street knows what it needs to focus on and change . They will be on top in no time. Keep up the great work guys. We will be back !",

I've eaten here for work lunches, birthday dinners, drinking on the patio, stopping in for a glass of wine at the bar, you name it. I've never had a bad experience here. The food has always been great, I've met the chef a couple of times just from sitting at the bar (super nice) and have always had great service. I highly recommend ordering off the specials menu in the very back. I'm honestly shocked at the negative reviews on here. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry previously, I know bad service and food not worth the price. I can usually tell from the moment I walk in, but this place has never given me that vibe. In fact, the last time I was here, our group had a few picky eaters and were completely accommodated without any hassle whatsoever. Sometimes I think people feel a sense of entitlement and think \"Server\" mean \"Servant.\" Keep up the great work. I really enjoy coming here and so does my entire office. :)",

I ordered some kind of chicken plate that I asked if they could instead create with just a chicken breast, well that didn't happen and after waiting for almost 45 minutes to receive our food I didn't have the energy or patience to request something else.  I notified the server that the order was wrong and ended up eating just the side that came with the plate, ( i was still charged for the full meal). Keep in mind we had a party of about 15 people with all of our bills ranging from 100 to 300 dollars.

By the time the butter arrived we had no bread. We ordered entrees at 6:30, for a party of 6 and the food arrived in 10 minute increments starting at 7:50. Food was not served at the same time for the entire table.  They seem more interested in serving wine and alcohol then food at this location. The original Grapestreet only has a license to serve wine, the Summerlin location has a full liquor license and people are indeed feeling good from the drinks. The food is very good and we already know how good the bread is. The pace in which the food comes out is sub par.",

At that location they stopped carrying a very simple and inexpensive wine \"white zin\".  I guess they wanted to take that location to another level so they stopped.  Went yesterday for lunch and ordered my favorite, Chicken Parmesan, and I was surprised to see they had tweaked the marinara sauce.  It's no longer a fresh delicious sauce, it's deeper in color and has a bite to it.  Why why why when something works for so long do these restaurants over think things and make changes?  I won't be going back.  The chicken parm is $22.00 so that's a bit steep when it's no longer your favorite.  So sad for me.",

The Chicken Parm, that my hubby ordered, was overcooked but covered with ample marinara and cheese that it was o.k. Other local restaurants have a much better dish. The Margharita Pizza was ok, but not worth 18 bucks.  Wouldn't go back for it.  The patio seating was nice and the service was very good. The indoor dining was very noisy.  Would not want to sit in there. Overall, there are too many other restaurants that have a similar menu, which are much better.",

    "text": "I love this place. The last few times I was here it was kind of busy, however, tonight was just right. They had the patio open on a beautiful May evening. After a few drinks at the bar, we were seated inside but it felt like we were on the balcony. If you haven't see this new spot, you're missing out. It's not like they're location on Buffalo. Still just as classy just more trendy and the bar is amazing.   I had the pleasure of meeting the management staff, Jeremy and Chris. When our table was available, Jeremy promptly took us to our table and recommended some starters and introduced us to Nick, our server. Nick was wonderful. He explained the specials and his recommendations. I initially wanted the chicken parm, usually my fav, but the rest of my party ordered the surf and turf special so I had to do the same. I didn't want to be jealous, after the fact.   While waiting for out entrees, we had the crab stuffed shrimp. It was pretty good. Only gripe was there was 5 pieces for 3 of us. Needless to say, my friends had the majority. The entrees came and were plated wonderfully. The filet and lobster was cooked to perfection. The vegetables were good and serving of mashed potatoes was a little heavy for me. Plus, I wanted to indulge with some desserts.   Jeremy had touched out table a few times throughout dinner and said we should try to the cheesecake and chocolate mousse. My party was a little quiet as they eyed the souffle hit again, we we not disappointed. I have to say, the mousse is my favorite dessert on the menu.   Tonight's experience was definitely what was I expected. I came one during their opening week and it was extremely crowded and the wait times were understandably a little longer, however, this time, the service, food and overall feel was spot on.   If your looking for a cool date spot with a hip flare, in Downtown Summerling for some shopping or looking for a unique dining experience without having to deal with The Strip, Grape St Summerlin is your place!!!",

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were all nice and cute and made friendly conversation with us. The wine and service were good.   Went back with a girlfriend for dinner last night and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the patio. Our waiter was a bit late coming buy our table but was very friendly. He didn't stop by too often, but was very nice and helpful when he did. We had the Burrata for a starter and it was good - nothing out of the ordinary, but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with burrata. We both ordered salads - Greek and Caesar - and they were good but nothing to rave about. They were a little drenched in dressing, but for the Caesar salad they did have a small option which was perfect for me.   The dessert menu was pretty big, in my opinion, and our waiter suggested that we have a look at it. We did, and had a couple in mind. Asked him what his favorite was - not on our list - but decided to give it a try.  We had the Apple Tart and it was pretty amazing.   The atmosphere on the patio was very nice - some people came in with their dogs and the dogs behaved just fine. The sun started to get in some people's eyes as it was setting and the restaurant staff were able to move some shades or something around and get the sun out of their eyes which was nice and accommodating.    I'm sure I will come back to Grape Street Cafe because of it's convenient location for me, and the nice relaxed vibe, but I wouldn't say it's on the top of my list or a \"must go\" place. Overall an enjoyable experience with Grape Street Cafe.",

My date ordered the \"special\" chicken that was raved about by the server but it was so horribly dry he had to send it back. When asked if he wanted the chef to remake it the server also informed us that 3 others had complained about the same thing that day, they of course took it off the bill. Server asked if he wanted something to replace it with so he just asked for some asparagus with goat cheese and then was charged a crazy amount (I believe $7/$8) for the replacement.

    "text": "WoW! Dramatic turn-around as far as my customer service experience, as compared to my last visit. It is once again a Monday night. I abhor weekend's here, it's just waaay too packed. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and acknowledged by no less than EVERYONE! The hostess, the two bartenders, the manager and it wasn't like it was dead; they had sufficient business. RJ the bartender, was very gregarious, attentive and accommodating. I ordered a Sta. Rita Hills Hitching Post Pinot Noir and a burrata prosciutto. As always the food is spot on. The wine is always served at the right temp (60-65). This time my over all experience was faaar superior. They have redeemed themselves. Now the question is, longevity.  ;-) Time will tell. I'll keep coming back.",

He was very educational about the menu and made it clear he was open to any questions and made great suggestions. I've been here once before and food was great, but tonight the attention to detail sealed the deal. I wasn't entirely pleased with my entree (could have just been a personal taste) but they were insistent on making it right. They sent out complimentary dessert and coffee, plus removed the meal from my check which was, in my opinion, above and beyond industry standard. I always have the utmost respect for places that go to such lengths to correct an error, and they definitely gained a loyal customer.",

I'm not the type of person to assume things but I'm pretty sure the server could care less for us because we were young and probably thought we couldn't afford to eat or tip. First off there was a little bug crawling around the table and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Coming from the restaurant business I know some people seek for free food or big discounts because a of a fly or a bug. I didn't want them to think we were those type of people. And when we paid the server we had a certain amount left to pay. He didn't even check because he just handed it to us. As a respectful teenager I didn't want to be that person who just leaves knowing the amount wasn't paid. As we told the server, the server had a rude attitude as he was swiping the card again. After that never again. I never tip lower than $7 especially if my bill is like low. I always tip 20% but I guess u get what you deserve ?",

We ordered  the tapas plate, roasted beet salad, poached salmon platter and the cheese and charticure board. The dill scallion sauce that came with the poached salmon was amazing! I was slightly unimpressed with the cheese and charticure, some rolls of meat and a couple pieces of cheese. A little over priced in my opinion. I was a little shocked at how much our bill came out to and drinks were over priced as well. I would come back, but probably during Happy Hour to save a buck!",

We kept it simple basic cocktails off their menu (cucumber martini and Tx old fashion) which were good zero complaints there.  But to eat we ordered a side salad which was just over killed by red onions, the steamed clams which were decent after adding a lot of salt because the sauce was bland, a pep n mush pizza which was good and the angel hair primavera which saved the day for my gf.  So that was it for the foods issue meanwhile we were battling a herd of what seemed to be fruit flies through out our entire time being their in the back by the servers side station.  So after we attempted to deal with that it just seemed that they were just understaffed and after asking several times to have numerous plates to be cleared we gave up and just toughed it out.  Again staff and manager were great just overwhelmed by the lack of help.",

    "text": "It was a last-minute Happy Hour for Ladies' Night Out.  I usually choose our venue for these gatherings, but this time I didn't.  I never would have picked a place with a HH that ends at 6 pm but, oh well.  I think it was chosen because there is music in the patio on Monday nights, and the phenomenally-talented sax player providing the entertainment is well-known by the woman who set it up.  I'd been to the former location on Lake Mead a number of times, but it was a first visit to this latest incarnation.  We were seated inside, in the bar area, but it was completely open to the patio.  My group called the event to start at 5:30 - reckless, IMO, because by the time the waiter made his way to our table, HH was almost up.  To his credit, he said it wouldn't be a problem to extend it, since the majority of our group hadn't arrived.  The room is impressive, with its massive wine wall and upscale decor, though little me could have used a booster seat for the low chair.  While the music was wonderful, it was loud, making it impossible to hold a conversation with all but the person sitting next to us.  And the fact that 10 of us were seated at a long table, mingling wasn't possible, defeating the purpose of our get-together.  Most of us ordered from the HH menu, and 7 is the magic number.  Wines are all $7, and there's ample choice.  Same for well drinks.  And also for menu items.  Guess the No. 7 is lucky in Vegas :).  Not knowing what to expect, we chose two items each, and it turned out to be too much.  Most presentations were beautiful:  My baked brie was rimmed with slices of pear and green apple, and red grapes, and was spectacularly good.  The stuffed shrimp, on the other hand, was ordinary, in more ways than one:  four shrimp each had a little dollop of what was supposed to be crabmeat but seemed to be strictly breadcrumbs.  The shrimp were set on a too-large plate with no frills except for a small lemon quarter.  Plating matters! They looked lonely and tasted bland.  Those who ordered the burrata were very happy, and the different colors of the cheese, asparagus, prosciutto and other goodies made for an impressive presentation.     Despite the earlier mostly-good waiter vibes, service was very spotty.  One woman who ordered the burrata had it served almost an hour after her meatballs had already filled her up, and our waiter was often hard to find.    Most, but not all, of the HH items are on the main menu.  For happy hour, it's a decent deal.  After that, not so much.  I don't think I'd come back for dinner without a hefty Groupon, and as a night owl, HH ends just too early for me.",

When we arrived, I said we had a reservation and stated my father in laws name.   The hostess said a name strikingly similar to his (same first McSomething for the last).   She said we arrived first.   We waited. And waited. And waited.   Then we received a phone call asking where we were, we said at the restaurant. Dad said, we've been waiting for you for an hour.   Let's recap. The hostess sat two couples from the same party, same reservation at opposite ends of the restaurant.   We told our server, he replied, \"hmm, it happens.\"  Except it doesn't happen in real life, it's like we were in a cartoon.   Honestly, I could get over the seating issue, I'd someone had taken ownership of this situation.   The server took our order at our parent's table.   No manager ever stopped by. Not to check on us, or apologize for the situation.   And that's just this time.   The last time we were here, the food runner handed me my brother in laws plate and asked me to put it in front of him.   I'd be ok with this if we were sharing tips, but the bastard didn't even tip me out.   At this price point, you should be able to sit with your family and not have to serve them.",

You know you'll have a great time and the evening is going to be perfect when you see Jeremy and Chris managing the floor. And my server Manny is just about the best server to serve ever. I honestly think he should teach a class on it. He gets to know everyone and he makes the atmosphere fun and enjoyable and the kid is hilarious. I've come here not happy with my day at all and just having him as my server changed it completely around. This is a five star restaurant with five star service and definitely worth the visit. I recommend this place to everyone come and you'll have a great time I know I do",

The waitress was friendly, but she seemed to be off somewhere else during the majority of the night. We sat for 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. At one point, a hostess had even tried to take our menus off the table until I had mentioned that we still had not ordered (we had been there for about 40 minutes by now). We waited another 15 minutes before ordering food. At no point during our evening, did the waitress offer any specials or review the specials with us. Another disappointment-they brought one tiny loaf of bread for 5 people. When they finally brought our entrees; our appetizer dishes and small plates were not cleared. The food was decent, but service is lacking.",

First, didn't want to spend a ton on wine but wanted to drink good stuff. Carl F recommended some really cool grapes.   Second, Kirbie was awesome. Food came as expected for a Saturday evening at a popular restaurant and she was terrific.  She suggested items and was always around.   Third, I had enjoyed a meal here a few months ago and the service and food were equally impressive. Again, sure there was a wait but it's a new place and those of us who have enjoyed new places know this is inevitable. You are not at Chilis!  Fourth, I had eaten at the original location for years and this location didn't disappoint.   Fifth, we got see a table of crazy folks throw a fit. Carl F handled it like a pro but these people had their heart set on a being pissed so I hope life improves because if that's how they react at a restaurant I can only imagine how they handle real life.   Bottom line....A cool DTS joint and we'll be back soon....",

The entrees were delicious and I really shouldn't have but I did and am happy to say that the desserts were worth the price of the indulgence.

We had to tell him what we wanted to drink and since it wasn't alcoholic I guess we were deemed not worthy.  He did come to take our order and we never saw him again until we had to get up and ask for our check.  The tortilla soup was really a hot mess--think ghost pepper vegetable soup with a few tortilla strips and a no flavor no crouton side caesar.  One entre was okay but beware the grilled chicken cobb.  It was a chopped mushy mess with hardly any chicken.  Needless to say it will be another long while before return.",

Grape Street Cafe is strategically located, pretty close to popular department stores. This is why it sometimes seem \"busy\". The truth is that with the first step (rude and unprofessional hostess) there is good reason to pass this place up. With so many restaurants I suggest walking a little further and realize all the choices you have in this outside mall. I've eaten here before and as hard as the owner works cooking; the food is just adequate. Too bad he doesn't hang up his chefs hat and become more aware of what's going on up front. I could not believe the hostess was so rude and demanding about where I had to sit. She squeezed me between two occupied tables very close to each other & to the kitchen. Really? when the entire restaurant was empty except for outside? Of course everyone wanted to sit outside, but we were told we could not. When I asked for the Manager, (who seemed to be bored with my experience with the hostess) he offered to sit me where the hostess could have effortlessly sat us in the first place. I admit I was being lazy choosing Grape Street Cafe as I had done in the past. Not this time! I made sure the Manager knew how upset I was with the obnoxious hostess and walked up to CRAVE.... and that's where  this story ends happily!",

Asked for a brighter, 4-Top by the window and commented to her, \"that is isn't crowded right now.\" She remained silent.  The Server arrived promptly and took my order. He subsequently returned six times during my sandwich to inquire if I needed anything, asked if I was \"just hanging out or if I had anything to do today\", if I was finished yet (I was still eating). He was attentive but overly so.  The complimentary loaf of bread was warm but uninteresting and tasted like yesterday's bake. Butter seemed to be margarine, but I may be wrong. I had the Portobello Philly Sandwich (portobello mushrooms sauteed with onions & peppers topped with smoked gouda $12.00) which was good, except for a crusty but also uninteresting french roll upon which it was served.  The breads are supposedly homemade but are airy, without much strength or bite. Similar to grocery store fare.  Several men were stocking the wines located behind the bar with much hollering back and forth and crashing of bottles. One man was on a ladder stocking and shouting from behind the wine bottles to the men at the front of the bar.  When I lunch, even by myself, I want to feel welcome. The lack of interplay by the hostess and the racket created by the workmen was a huge turnoff.  Several friends and I are slated to lunch at Grape Street Summerlin in a few weeks. I will make reservations in person the day before and select the table at which we wish to be seated and will provide a report once we have lunched with them.",

The place has a great atmosphere that drew me in for a quick bite even though I was alone. They were friendly and promptly seated me on the patio as requested.   The food: I didn't have to wait long for fresh bread (good on the inner but very hard on the outside) however I had to wait a little while for the butter they forgot to serve with the bread...which I eventually asked for. I was happy when they had a vegetarian soup of the day and figured I would be safe ordering the house salad. When asked if I wanted chicken added, I clearly declined. The salad was served tossed and finely chopped almost like coleslaw. After eating 4 or 5 bites I noticed small chicken pieces in the salad.   I summoned the waiter who at first tried to convince me it wasn't chicken lol. He then asked if it was a problem.   Yes it was. Congrats you messed up a simple salad and lost a customer.   I just wanted to politely excuse myself and leave at that point. They comped the meal and offered to make a new salad. I left.",

I ordered Snow Crab Stuffed Shrimp, when I got the dish there was no Crab stuffed in the Shrimp all they had was Bread Crumbs. I sent it back and had it taken off the bill. The restaurant that they had on Lake Mead was a very good restaurant. This restaurant is over priced and the food is of poor quality. The last time for this restaurant",

I get it \"hh people are cheap\". It annoys you, right? Look we came in to relax and yes order happy hour, I'm sorry . How about ask us \" did you want the hh clams or the clams off the regular menu?  We were just trying to relax before we had to run some more errands and we left angry and frustrated.",

The last two occassions I have stopped in at happy hour at the Downtiwn Summerlin location the bartender (dark hair girl - Courtney? She works Friday afternoons) was unwelcoming and rude.   The first time I was willing to chalk it up to having a bad day but tonight my friend and I came in and sat at the bar. Not a hello, how are you greetting. We were thrown menus and she walked away. After a bit she came back and asked \"do you know what you want yet??\"  Excuse me?  I have never gone into an establishment only to walk right out because of the attitude of a an employee working there. I suggest if you make your living in the hospitality industry you learn some hospitality.  I will never go into this restaurant as long as she is behind the bar",

We didn't order any food as we just went for a drink and then onto the next bar. But it was a nice ambiance and the food looked delicious. I didn't give this place a five star because we spoke to the manager of the place and he seemed rude. Wasn't personable at all. We asked a question about the name of the place we kept saying it wrong, and he just seemed irritated and then slid his card on the bar so we can see the name of the place and walked off. My wife and the guy sitting next to us thought that was rude.   Would I come back/recommend? Yes I would. Only to try the food next.",

Busy vibe and great ambience to the place to start off the night right. We ordered some wine and cocktails which came out in the fashion that molasses does when making bbq sauce. When the waiter (who was awesome and personal) came by to bring the first round we just put the second order in for our drinks.    Food order was taken which I ordered mussels with red sauce and a caprese salad. I felt I was being punked when they brought over the food for the table. The food was so uninspired by the culinary team.   New Zealand Mussels arrived on a plate shell down with the mussel topped with sauce and some cheap shredded parm melted on top. Frozen precooked recooked mussels are not appetizing not should be allowed for human consumption, you're a restaurant in summerlin that should be ordering fresh shellfish   Caprese salad was 3 pieces of beefsteak tomatoes torn basil, and mozzarella cheese. No salt, cheap balsamic and what tasted like blended cooking oil. The disconnect on this dish is astonishing and needs to be revisited.   Heard lots about this place and wanted to like it but I have left less than pleased in the food.",

The lightning adds a hint of romanticism to this bustling outdoor shopping area.   We were greeted by our friendly host who was quick to seat us prior to our reservation time. Our server also provided a friendly introduction and promptly took our drink order.   After listening to the amazing list of specials we decided on the Baked Brie appetizer. This dish takes time to prepare so order early. What a very delicious dish, served with crostini and sliced fruit, I want to try and make this dish ar home.   All entrees that we tried were very flavorful. I had a black end chicken carbonara pasta dish with a creamy Alfredo sauce. Yum! Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well.  For dessert we had the cheesecake and Creme Brulee that had a proper sugary crust.  The cheesecake had a delicious crust and was thick and creamy NY style. You can tell alot of care and profesionalism  goes into the preparation of the food in this kitchen.   Overall a great first visit that will keep us coming back for more. As the sun went down it did start to get cold in the building with all the doors opened and no heaters on. The energy in the room was somber yet electric with the Vegas Golden Knights on TV.   Well done!",

    "text": "I have enjoyed this place before, years ago. But today I was quite disappointed. Apps were so so. Had the steamed clams and baked brie. I ordered ribeye for my late lunch/early dinner. So at about 3 on a Monday,  they were out of Ribeye. What? Then the server suggested the \"smaller one\". The only other steak on the menu was a filet. I said, well, that is a completely different cut of meat. I was sort of shocked she wasn't really aware it wasn't just a smaller ribeye.   So I switched to the halibut. It came with ratatouille and mashed leeks. I asked to sub the leeks for asparagus/carrots they were serving.  I also asked for the ver blanc on the side.  The plate came: a horribly over cooked, dry chunk of halibut next to 3 carrots and 3 asparagus spears. No side of ver blanc and no ratatouille. I tasted my friends ver blank- lemon overpowered by some cloyingly sweetness. By then we were just ready to go rather than send back and wait for refires. I doubted they had any halibut that wasn't sawdust dry.  But we let our server know. She brought the ratatouille, but no ver blanc. We told her we couldn't wait to return a new plate.   The Ratatouille was adequate. Sauce tasted like a jar of Ragu.    I would have expected a reduction in the ticket given you couldn't cut the halibut even with a fork and lots of pressure. Not a dime worth of courtesy. Bill with no alcohol was over 100 dollars for what was about a Denny's quality meal.   No more Grape Street Cafe for me. Not with so many really good choices out there.",

It is something I typically wouldn't order, but I was surprised how delicious the soup was. I thought I was just going to get a bisque type soup, but I got a creamy soup with bits of cauliflower, carrots, and celery. I would definitely order this soup again. My colleagues all ordered different types of salad. Most liked their salads, but some complained that there was too much dressing and that their salads were wet.   The atmosphere was chill and casual. Not too fancy or hoity toity. The server we had was very nice, attentive, and refilled our drinks regularly.

The outside patio was nice, the weather was great and you could watch all the people walking by. The chairs were incredibly uncomfortable. So uncomfortable that both my friend and I were in pain by the time we left. Thank goodness for happy hour because they are really over priced for what you get. I did enjoy the Brie and would definitely get that again. The service was less to be desired.

I thought it was in my head but now I'm VERY ill. I don't eat meat and there was nothing listed in the ingredients that led me to believe there was any included. So I'm just curious what that cream sauce was. Thank you!",

I had the chicken Gorgonzola with the upgrade to blackened chicken and roasted pears.  The roasted pears is literally 2 slivers of pear slices, hardly pears.  It was plain, uneventful.  Definitely, not enough sauce on the pasta.  My friend had the shrimp salad, which was very, very good, but very, very expensive for a small salad $16.00.   I had to ask for a refill for my iced tea, so I basically had one served glass, because the refill did not come until we were about to leave. Other than that, the service was fast and friendly.   Ugh, is my thought, just ugh.",

The space is gorgeous and I specifically liked the bottle wall and the cute wooden style tables and chairs.  The space feels very open. There are 2 tv screens to watch sports.  There's a serious amount of fresh, warm bread in a basket with butter brought to the table. If you don't hold yourself from eating this delicious bread, you won't make it to eating your actual course.  I ordered the shrimp pesto pizza . I am not a fan of pizza and never order it, but I was curious of their thin crust one. It was delicious. I would order it again. There was a perfect balance of ingredients. The shrimp were cut in pieces and had good flavor. The cheeses were mouth melting. So good!  When served, there is fresh shaved Parmesan also offered at the table.  Really do not understand the many bad reviews because we had an excellent experience here. Staff, location, food, even the nice bathroom!",

    "text": "This was our first time trying this place. Having been to Downtown Summerlin plenty of times, we had eyeballed this place to check out one day. We actually dined here with a couple of good friends tonight, so we were a party of four.  Ambiance (4/5) The atmosphere was pretty cool! The wall of wine was quite impressive and they had us seated in front of a large projector screen TV showing the National Championship game! Very cool.   Food (3/5) I personally had the manicotti dish. This dish was okay. I can't say anything bad about it, just that it lacked the \"wow\" factor. My friend had the philly cheese steak and said it was pretty much the same thing. It wasn't bad at all, there was just nothing about it that made it stand out. Not bad, not great. Had better, had worse.  I did really enjoy the HH app of Meatballs and garlic bread for only $7! The meatballs were tasty and the garlic bread pretty good as well.  Service (3/5)  Service was a-okay. Waters were filled and orders brought out. As much as I had read about great service from so many of these reviews, we weren't blown away by the service we received here. It wasn't terrible, mind you.   I'm betting you're picking up on a general theme here, huh? This place wasn't terrible, but also wasn't anything special. Our experience here was alright, but I honestly don't see myself ever coming back here. There are just too many great dining options in this incredible city to check out and enjoy!  3 stars.  A-Ok.",

It started off on a bad note as they were playing Christmas music (its Jan...) when we walked in and later changed the music to rock and had it up so loud we had to ask our server to turn it down as we couldn't even talk to each other.   The server was mediocre never explaining any specials or welcoming us to the restaurant.  We ordered bottles of wine and as he is going around the table pouring it he proceeded to pour red wine into one of girls white wines never even noticing, and poured the wine into another gentleman's dirty wine glass from a different wine he had earlier at the bar.   The service as a whole was really lacking as we had empty water glasses throughout dinner and when we were done, they cleared the plates and never came back to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee etc and when he brought the check he had charged us for the white wine he had ruined when he poured the red into it.  Food was ok but nothing that you couldn't get somewhere else and took forever to come out (restaurant only had 3 tables). Bill for 8 with 3 bottles of wine, 2 cocktails, an appetizer, and 8 entrees--- $470   Management needs to step in immediately and address and retrain the servers or this place will be closed before April.",

I'm more than understanding if it's truly busy and they're low on servers, but that wasn't the case. Our server was at the back of the house the whole time and managed to show up only to fill in drinks for other tables but ours. When he finally managed to take our orders, there was no acknowledgement of the fact that it took 45 minutes for him to take our food orders. Totally unacceptable!  If we decide to come back, I believe the bar will probably work out best as there will be someone more attentive... I don't usually write yelp reviews but this experience compelled me to start an account and write one as I want this place to succeed, with high hopes to be our regular place.",

It almost feels as if its a service entrance from the outside. Also near the restrooms there were cases of alcohol stacked up. Besides that, the place looks fun, hipster, cool. Now the menu. Started off with the mussel appetizer & crab louie salad. The mussels were good in flavor. But the crab louie was just ordinary. Not much of flavor or presentation. For the price of $24  I expected a little bit more crab, and better flavors. The ribeye/mashed potato grilled asparagus-not bad. The cooking temp of the ribeye was brought to us wrong, but the server never checked on us. We ordered med. rare and it came out med well. If a server had checked on us we would've sent it back. Overall the food was not spectacular, or even great. For the price I probably would go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Below is what happens when I write a review while I'm hangry after waiting close to two hours to be seated for my early birthday dinner. I've been here twice, with a great first experience meeting friends for dinner and being showered with attention. The second time was a letdown from our first kiss experience, if only the hostess didn't have an attitude and would have let us known sooner so we could go somewhere else to have dinner...like the nearby Crave. I would like to say that despite the excessive wait \"due to a mishap in the kitchen\" (which I saw was an excuse cited on another review), the service once seated was again excellent. Our server made sure he took our order promptly and the lady manager took care of a round of drinks for us. This was much later in the night when the dust settled and the short staffed restaurant could actually keep up. The food as my daughter called it is \"acceptable, but not exceptional\". Clams & Linguini - dry, very dry. Thankfully our wonderful server brought out a large \"spoonful\" more of broth. Downtown Summerlin may be experiencing a broth shortage & conserving. Oscar Filet - Cooked medium well perfect, albeit underseasoned. The crab meat in bernaise was delicious and got us curious about trying this at Oscars next time. Chicken Marsala - a very good dish that is similar to the one I make. Thin sliced velveted chicken with a very light translucent marsala sauce, served with mashed potatoes topped with fried leeks (fancy onion straws). The wine wall is pretty, but we didn't understand how climbing up the wall to get bottles was safe or sanitary...shoes that have been walking through kitchen, bathrooms and now leaving all that behind for the next person to grab and bring to your table....hmm. I can't wait to see who will own or close down this restaurant when a wine bottle or staff member falls on top of them.  Hangry Review: DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE LIED TO ABOUT WAIT TIMES.  Decided to write a review after our 2nd experience here. First off, you can't make a reservation unless it's for a party of 8 or more. We got here at 7:30 and told there would be an hour wait. Ok fine, this is Downtown Snoberlin so we decided to wait. We check in again after 50 minutes and told to wait another 30-45 minutes.  If it weren't for the fact we've already wasted over an hour waiting for this hyped up location, we would have left. I'm writing this review while sitting in the waiting area and getting more irritated by the minute as I see parties of 2 seated at tables for 4. The girls running the front desk are clueless and the manager non-existent. I honestly will never return to this location again. As far as the food goes, it was ok... anything halfway decent in Summerlin will draw this sheltered crowd.",

Not so at Grape Street, where the distinct red sauce on our Seafood Linguine dish really stood out.  My grilled cheese sandwich was so far from what I expected (made with goat cheese, prosciutto, basil & peppers), but delicious nevertheless.    Food prices are reasonable, but drinks are a bit high.  Service was fantastic, from the cutie hostess who gladly took our dog in (to the patio seating), to the myriad of pleasant servers that came by.  Service could speed up a bit though.  All-in-all, highly recommend it.  Table-for-1 Factor:  They do have a bar, but not sure the atmosphere is fit for going solo.",

We were seated about 5 minutes and our waiter finally came and absentmindedly plopped someone else's check in front of us. He quickly realized his mistake and spent a good few minutes laughing it off and we didn't really mind it.  I had some sparkling wine and my husband ordered one of their listed pinot noir but our waiter said he does not recommend it and steered him towards a higher priced pinot. When I was brought my wine, our waiter claimed that he remembered serving me this particular wine on my last visit. Odd. Since we just told him a few minutes ago that we've never been to this restaurant before. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which was a decent portion, tender and tasty. I just had the mussels in red sauce appetizer. It was standard but there were only six pieces.  When we asked for the check, I made a joke to our waiter about having him bring our check to the next table. He said that he couldn't do that and went on some long-winded anecdote on how some other table paid for someone else's meal. OK, so he also forgot that he gave us someone else's check earlier. At this point, we were convinced our waiter was suffering from short-term memory loss.   The verdict, food and wine were alright while the odd server interactions left us scratching our heads.",

Because I had eaten at the old Grape Street location and liked it in the past, we figured we would give the new location a chance. They didn't take reservations and the night before Super Bowl this place was really packed. The hostess promised us a 10 minute wait. She kept her word. We were seated in under 10 minutes. Our server, Marc, was absolutely terrific. He is funny, personable, and made us feel right at home immediately. He answered all questions about the specials, brought our drinks, and brought bread that was really hot out of the oven. For our meal, my wife and I decided to try the special 24 ounce ribeye steak. It was prepared with a bleu cheese rub and carmelized onions on top. It was scrumptious. Unless you have a huge appetite, there was more than enough food to share. It also came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Also extremely well done. My only gripe with the restaurant is the noise level in the dining room. The dining tables are immediately next to the bar. And the bar was extremely loud ( did I mention it was the night before Super Bowl?)  I ended up coming home from what should have been normal conversation across this a small table with my voice totally gone. Based on the food, this restaurant should have a five star review. However because of the noise, I dropped it down to a four star. I will definitely come back here again on a quieter weekday night. The quality of the food is worth the drive.",

It reminded me me of a large biscuit which was awkward in a loaf form, but i enjoyed it never less. The sangria was delicious. Since this was our first time, we ask for recommendations from the waiter and he gave us the run down but he and the hostess agreed that the penne vodka sauce(can't remember the actual name) was the best. When it arrived... I was pretty underwhelmed. The sauce had a nasty after taste as if something burnt at the bottom of the pan. I don't think the addition of asparagus helped.  We quickly moved on to dessert. I decided the flourless chocolate cake and my friend order the bread pudding. Both desserts were soggy and had the exact same texture. The ice cream was delicious which I'm sure didn't come from the kitchen.   I would agree that this place has so much potential but the food is terrible for the price. Really it's just terrible at any price. If I return, I'd only be there for the drinks and great service.",

We loved the food and service was attentive. Food was a bit of a wait, but it was date night so it gave us time to chat.  My husband and I both started with a glass of wine and both were delicious. I was surprised to find that the wines by the glass were reasonably priced. Nothing is better with wine than meat and cheese so we ordered the Meat & Cheese Plate. What a spread! My husband is picky with cheeses and he was willing to eat three of the four cheeses. The plate also had pickles, candied nuts, crackers, crostini, jam, olives, and mustard.   My Chicken Piccata was delicious and a little different. Instead of a chicken breast it was a bone in piece of roasted chicken. I loved the textures and tastes of everything in the dish. My House Salad to start was simple, but good. I liked that it had blue cheese. My husband ordered Baked Penne and enjoyed it.   Our waiter and the gentleman helping him were very attentive. They checked in often, cleared plates quickly, and kept our drinks full.",

    "text": "It's tough to give an appropriate rating.   The good - we were promptly seated at a six top. Unfortunately next to the bar with a lot of traffic. The restaurant was fairly empty so I'm not sure why we got that particular table. It wasn't ideal but whatever.  Bread arrived quickly and the server took our drink orders promptly. Our wines were a decent pour as expected for $10-17 per glass. The server was polite and very patient as we had a lot of allergies and special orders. I even asked him if we were trying his patience and he said we were great.   The food was excellent. Loved the house salad. My chicken piccata was excellent, not too heavy. The others loved their salmon, pasta and scallops. They took great care with my husband's gluten allergy.  Why three stars? - We were just partially through our salads when (you guessed it) our entrees arrived. The runners didn't seem phased by the fact that they had to push our salads aside to put the entrees on the table. This is inexcusable for a quality restaurant with entrees ranging between $25 and $40.  I immediately asked for the manager who apologized but didn't seem at all appalled. Our server also apologized and said he put the order in as courses. When I asked who dropped the ball he said he wouldn't blame anyone else so he took the fall.  To their credit they offered complimentary desserts which were declined.   We are locals who like to eat out 2-3 times a week. It's sad that Grape Street won't be in our regular rotation. Maybe we'll give them another try in a year or two.",

It's a fantastic location in DT Summerlin, they have a killer patio, it's all wine and cheese and meat - all the things I love. It's a perfect keto set up...but everything here disappoints.  First, the pricing is right at that annoying price point, where like, it's kind of expensive...which would be fine if the food was amazing, but it's not. It's really not. Mediocre is the best way to describe the food here.  The steak salad, especially, is....very sad.   There are a few things on the menu that are good - burrata, the charcuterie plate...but again, the price point is too high for the food that arrives on your plate.  Their happy hour is...lacking. AND it's a Mon - Thur happy hour. Come on guys, get it together.  Oh - and I recently noticed the weirdest thing. They store their wine upright. How is that okay? Wine is supposed to be stored slanted down so that the corks don't dry out, no?   It's all very confusing - and maybe that's a good way to describe the experience - this place is confused and so are you when you get the bill.",

Was it because we were women or of a difference race or he thought maybe we were gay.  Whatever it was it was obvious he didn't want us there.  When we asked the hostess of how we provide our feedback she told us there was no survey.   Vegas has lots of amazing restaurants this is one we won't be coming back to.

My main complaint is was the $15 mussels appetizer consisted of 5 tough mussels splashed with marinara that tasted like it came out of a can....my wife's soup was good but not great... I just wish they used the space for food that deserved it.

She was still talking to the couple so I asked for menus...she then went and got the menu not right away but a few seconds later and then said I saw you. Really?! Anyways, after receiving the menu she walked away. Rude Rude Rude!!! So I went and sat at a table and received much better service from the hostess and a male server.

After some back and forth arguing between myself and the employee he took the wrong salad back to get the correct one.

First off, the tables are so close together you feel like your flying coach on southwest.  Get ready to get intimate with the strangers your sitting next to.    We were going to start off by ordering some appetizers from the happy hour menu.  While I was ordering, mid order,  the server took out his phone to check a txt message.  People that came in after us were already receiving their entre's, and we had not even gotten our bread.  Took about 30 minutes just to get the 7$ glass of happy hour wine that we had ordered.  After around 45 minutes, and seeing another party receive their entre's, we had had enough.  Never even got to try the food.  We left cash with the hostess and went to BWW where we were treated like paying customers.",

Let me 1st say that the food at this one, his 2nd restaurant, has never been as good or consistent as the old one, now Grape Vine, yum!  2nd, years ago at the old Grape Street, their staff used to practice \"padding\" the bill and adding extra tip....when discussed w the owner, he did not seem to care and defended his staff (several, not just one)!  Fast forward to the new DTS location, went last night and we had pizza, fondue, 1 cocktail and 4 beers and received $120 bill.  Note: we were with others who also ate and drink and paid their bill prior to leaving (they double charged us based on our party).  Again I want to reiterate to read your bill very carefully and share with all of vegas if these business practices continue...someone is encouraging wait staff to do this!",

    "text": "I have been going to the location on Lake Mead and Buffalo for years, I always loved the place. I was excited to hear they were opening a new location.   I have been twice so far. The first time our server was good enough and the food was tasty, but the service as a whole was not good. Our drinks took forever, as well as our food, and the entire time the OWNER was sitting at the bar DRINKING while the customers were suffering. There were people at tables looking around wondering where their drinks and/or food were whilst servers and hostesses were sitting at the bar eating and polishing glassware.  All in all, the experience wasn't a great one but because I was so loyal to the old location I figured it was just the new staff adjusting to an opening.   Second visit was a completely different story. Absolutely HORRIBLE service, and it wasn't even busy! Our server took literally over ten minutes to bring out our water, and I had to ask her for lemon three times.  Normally I am patient at restaurants bc I have been in the service industry for over ten years now, but this was one of the few times I lost my patience. My four year old was with us and I repeatedly asked for bread just to appease him because our food was taking so long. Twenty minutes later with nothing but water on our table I eventually ended up snapping at our server. We stopped by for a quick lunch at 4pm and ended up being there for over an hour, it was awful. And not to mention our appetizer came out AFTER our meals. And again, the owner was sitting at the bar drinking while the restaurant was falling apart.   Unfortunately, even after my years of loyalty to the place, I will most likely never return to this location. I sincerely hope John, the owner, wises up and fixes these issues or the the place will never survive.",

In addition to the disappointing meal, all three orders were cold when they got to the table.  Cold Cream of mushroom soup is the worst.  My friend sent it back and it was warmer, but you could tell it was congealed when it hit the table. It was a $70 lunch for 3.  Not worth $15 for all 3 dishes. So sad, I loved this place.

It was chilly that day so we asked our waiter Mike if we could close the small door next to our table.  Not the big pocket window just the small door by our table.  He threw a fit and said \"close it if you want\".  We ordered iced tea but were so cold that we switched to hot tea and the waiter charged us for both stating that we had both??  We waited over an hour and still hadn't received our salads, it wasn't even that busy.  In the meantime 2 of our friends joined us and decided not to order anything after seeing the way we were being treated by our waiter and the length of time it was taking to get our food.  Our waiter was beyond rude the entire time, I don't even know what to say.  We all have bad days sometimes but this was ridiculous.  Call in sick if your not able to treat your customers like human beings. We are 20-25% tippers and due to the horrific service we decided to be generous with 10%, he deserved nothing.  When we left he actually followed us outside and said \"thanks a lot ladies\" while crumbling up a piece of paper aggressively.   To top it off our steak salads weren't even good.  Not that we would have enjoyed it with all of the attitude we were getting.  I called the manager that evening and I NEVER do that.  I thought he'd want to know what happened.  His name was Chris.  He seemed to genuinely care and said he'd look into it and get back to me.  He said he wanted to do something for my friends and I.  I didn't call because we wanted anything, I just have never had such an experience and my friends and I wanted to complain.  Regardless...he never called back.  It's such a cute spot and has such potential but there are much better places in DTS, places with good food, good service, that actually appreciate their customers.",

I am in a t-shirt and jeans drinking juice, so you judge me?  You are located in a mall, guess what?  There are going to be people in t-shirts drinking juice.  I am sorry I didn't put on a suit after hiking at red rock to go to the mall and walk around checking things out.  Obviously the one star is  solely for the hostess who needs to learn not to judge people.  5 stars for your wine pricing.  I will definitely be back to have a bottle of Relentless and try your food.

Luckily our server was overly nice to us about the wait time. Funny thing is, I called in and specifically mentioned I was having a business lunch and wanted to be assured a table, but they would not take my reservation because it was not 6+ people. The hostess assured me we would be able to get a table, when I arrived it was packed and I had heart palpitations foreseeing my misery in front of my clients when I wouldn't be able to acquire a table!   We still ended up with a table outside on the patio, thankfully.  Little black bugs flew around us the whole time we ate. Swiping at bugs and trying to enjoy a business lunch is horrible. I think they may live in the green bushes that surround the patio.   I ordered the Blackended Salmon Salad. Came out with some decent lettuce, some lettuce had brown spots, and some lettuce was wilted - and the dressing was HEAVY. Also, this salad was kind of boring - it just LOOKED bland. There was no garnishes, and very few croutons. The salmon was the saving grace - it was blackened nicely, with some tasty spices, but not over-powering. Plus, the salmon was quite large - no skimping on size.  I think they are still working out their kinks, but with so many other options to eat at in DS, I don't think I will return here. Perhaps their original location on Lake Mead is better?",

So at least she acknowledged she was in the wrong.  I ordered the red sangria.  Highly recommend it! Great for a summer night.  We ordered the garlic bulbs (which we never received. We had to ask to get removed from our bill at the end). The French bread is amazing that is complimentary. Fresh.  I had the grilled cheese. It had goat cheese, bell peppers, basil .... On that same French bread. Yummmm!  My boyfriend had the Greek salad and loved it! He said very light and refreshing.

One of the many hidden places off the strip is the lovely Grape Street Cafe and Wine Bar. This lovely restaurant is nestled right in the middle of Summerlin Towne Center.  I was diggin' the Grape Street Cafe and Wine Bar! Honestly, if you ask me--this was a perfect touch to add to the outdoor \"mall-style\" shopping center. Grape Cafe offers a sexy ambience inside a brick-lined, candlelighted cozy restaurant.   I walked in and seated myself at the bar. I had the amazing opportunity to have Allie as my Winetender. I started off with a light Moscato as I explored the food menu. I didn't want anything too heavy, although the pasta looked appetizing! I decided to go with a small appetizer of Calamari and one more drink (this time stronger!), the top shelf Margarita!   The vibe during my visit was amazing. Allie was very attentive and did a great job giving all the patrons enough attention and made sure we were well taken care of. Seemed like many of the people that walked in were locals as Allie knew many people by first name.   Overall, it was a great place to relax and have a drink while exploring the outdoor shopping center. I wish I would have come here for Happy Hour as I hear that the options during that time are well worth the price! I will have to check this place out the next time I am in town!   P.S-There is also a patio outside for you to enjoy on a lovely \"cool\" day!  I would be back the next time I am in Vegas.",

The noise level was okay not to loud and not too quiet. The chairs where plush and super comfortable. I felt so relaxed as if I was at home dining.   I didn't have any more room for dessert. I know I will be back so I might start with dessert first next time I come back lol.   I found their patio to be adorable and fun for a drink with your friend on the weekend or maybe happy hour fun times with your coworkers after work, you know just to wait for the traffic to die down ha, ha, ha.",

I said I did not want it crispy though. When I got my salad my salmon was baked but it was crispy. It was a big piece but it tasted a little too salty. The salad was good but the dressing was not very good. It was a strange dressing for this salad. The bread they brought to the table was delicious. That as a plus. The waiter was very attentive. That was good. The ambience of the restaurant was good and I liked the decor.",

The concept is straightforward and enticing--lots of items only for $7. Before we got our food back, we thought that those were reasonable prices.  We ordered the crab stuffed shrimp, meatballs, and steamed clams. Out of the three dishes, nothing stood out to me. They all tasted boring and had nothing special. The most hilarious dish was the shrimp because they were all probably the size of my pinky and only came with four pieces. I get happy hour often serves smaller portions, but that's just food for ants!  Service was ok. Food was subpar. Eh, would not come again.",

Most of us had salads since we are all trying to keep fit for our trophy wives. Unfortunately, my salad was the worse of the lot. I ordered the grape street chef salad. See photo attached. It was bland, too bland. My buddies' salads were better. They had the Greek salad with blackened something on top. But, I had a good time regardless. Then came the check.... we threw in $35 in cash and asked that the rest be split amongst 7 credit cards. I guess that was too much them, and the stress began.

My last few food experiences have been disappointing and tonight was no exception. With a heavy heart I let my Server Mike know about the food and I have to applaud how well he handled my feedback. MIKE is a True  professional  and shared my passion  for Grape Street's awesome history of being a fun and delicious  place to dine. He immediately had the chef prepare the dish I sent back so he could taste it and look into what went wrong. He agreed it was off and wanted to make it right. We had a great conversation about food and service. His passion for his customers and the restaurant  was evident.  Thanks Mike for being so accommodating  and concerned about our experience. I am definitely rooting  for Grape Steet to iron out the kinks and get back to the consistency and great food I come for.  *And he only charged me for one tea*",

The quality of the food was worse than Olive Garden with hopes that the atmosphere and booze would distract you from the obvious. Of all the wines they offer by the bottle, they only have one Merlot by the glass?! There are too many choices for great restaurants in Las Vegas, Grape Street definitely is not one of them. I guess they are hoping this new location will succeed based on their original location's success.  In my opinion, this location has tarnished that reputation, that is why we will never dine there again.",

One worker kept coming out from the kitchen and the bartender would pour him a shot and give him a beer and off he went back to work.  I couldn't believe it.  The owner also doing shots and talking at the top of his voice to one of his buddies at the bar.  Very annoying.  Service at the bar slow, bartenders too busy talking to each other, and the bottle of wine I ordered they didn't have so why is it on the menu.  Supposed to be a wine bar but wine selection very limited.  Trattaoria Reggiano across the street far superior and the have live music on Thurs and Fri night, great food, wine and service.  There's too much competition with bars and restaurants in the Red Rock, Boca Park, West Charleston area to not pay attention to how you run your business.",

    "text": "I have eaten here twice. The first time was perfect fine. a nice waitress/charcuterie plate/glass of wine. But the second time was they worst experience ever. I ordered a veggie sandwich without the bun, specifically stating that I was gluten free and made that clear to the waiter. When the server brought out the \"sandwich\" (just grilled veggies essentially) it had a side dish that looked rice-like but i wasn't sure so i asked the server \"is this rice\" to which he responded \"yes\". I tried the rice and started to swallow the first bite and then spit it out because the texture was not right. I called the server back and asked him is he was SURE this was rice. He then said \"ill check\" and went back to the kitchen before telling me it was orzo pasta - aka not gluten free. I immediately asked for a manager. The fact that the waiter never even asked about sides when i mentioned gluten free was just one of the things that was wrong. The manager came over and I explained the situation and he stated that my sandwich would be taken care of. A few minutes later, the waiter came over and asked \"how is everything?\" essentially as if he didn't royally mess up my order resulting in my having a bit of something with gluten when i am gluten intolerant. I looked at him surprised and said \"uh, its ok i guess\". He then gave me a dirty look and turned away muttering under his breath \"I wasn't the one who said it\" - referring to the serve telling me that the side dish was rice. 1. this was incredibly rude and 2. it was his fault the orzo was on the plate in the first place since he did not make sure my dish was gluten free and did not do the extra work to make sure the side dish was too. From then on, he would not make eye contact or acknowledge me. When he took my plate away i said \"thank you\" and he would not even look at me. He never filled our water glasses a single time. He came back and asked my friend \"how was YOUR dish honey\" keeping his back to me. Later, he brought a dessert menu, turned his back to me when he placed it and also placed the menu directly in front of her and turned only towards her in a very pointed sign of disdain towards me. As the manager had never returned to our table after the first time, I immediately went up to speak to him. After so many blatant signs of disrespect coming from our arrogant waiter - that my friend was shocked by - i was shaking I was so upset. I went to the manager and explained the whole situation to him and he said he was sorry and that the whole bill would be taken care of. While I appreciated the manager's handling of the situation with me, I am just appalled by the treatment by the waiter. It will certainly be hard for me to ever return.",

Each time I make the same mistake of going back to Grape Street, I usually leave disappointed or in tonight's case never wanting to go back.  After tonight's expierence, shame on me if I make the same mistake. The service was horrible, our waitress along with every other figure of authority along with with owner was schmoozing at the bar.  The menu is in dire need of an update, it has not been refreshed since the restuarant opened on Lake Mead.  Since the opening of Downtown Summerlin, each time I have dined in the restuarant it feels like the owner thinks he has made it and he and his staff are on cruise control, when in fact they need to party less during business hours and pay attention to service and quality control.  Tonight I sat for 45 minutes for a salad and did not get what I ordered, ended up sending my food back and not eating dinner at all!  What a waste of time...all for not!",

The hostesses are adorable and very accommodating. I've brought in my dog almost every time and they are so sweet to her! I love how the patio is dog friendly and it's really a beautiful area. I just hope management will improve some of its wait staff/kitchen. The last two Thursdays I've been and it has taken forever to get anything out on the table. The place was busy so I will give them that, but it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get your first drink out after ordering or 35 minutes just to receive the baked brie appetizer. One of the times my drink broke while in my hand, in which the busser saw and came and picked up the broken glass, but I was never offered another one by him and he also didn't clean up the ice and alcohol which was then dripping off the table and my leg for the next 15 minutes. In the waitreses's defense I don't think she ever even knew about it because it took her about 10 minutes to even come around again. Other restaurants would have gotten me one right away or comped my next drink but sadly that didn't happen! If you sit at the bar, go to Sam. She makes incredible drinks which is why I always return despite the shitty service I tend to keep getting on the patio. The food is also good, if you ever end up receiving it. I hope this place can get its act together because I really love the atmosphere and would love to see it succeed.",

She could have sat us in the restaurant at a smaller table but this was probably easier.  A little while after we got our food a group of people came over to our table and said the hostess told us to sit with you guys.  First of all this is not a fast food restaurant so why didn't the hostess come seat them or ask us if this was okay.  Secondly we are still in the middle of dinner so the waiter or hostess could have asked us to if we would like to move to another table since they had 8 in their party.  I immediately asked our waiter for the check, and when he saw my disgust with what was happening he did offer to buy us dessert, which we declined.",

It's crazy to me that the menu is exactly the same and the food is more expensive. I understand the rent is probably more, but at least throw in some decent happy hour pricing/specials to make up for it. The baked Brie was disappointing... over cooked pastry isn't too appealing and the apples/pears were sour. Hope it evens out there soon! I'd rather drive to the other location for now.",

Grape street is consistent in their mission to serve savory, wonderful food and top shelf wines at both locations and I will always give them kudos for that. The wait staff here is so accommodating and friendly and for that I also give them 5 stars. My overall 3 star review is based on the atmosphere. It was as if a drunken fraternity party let out into the restaurant, yelling all over the place and I really do not adhere to that kind of behavior when I'm enjoying fine food and wine.

Our waiter was nice, but it seemed like he was trying to rush us in ordering and picking up our dishes and such.  Maybe it was time for him to go home.  He wasn't rude or anything though.  The menu is amazing.  They have something for just about everyone on there.  I had the Manicotti, which is becoming harder and harder to find for some reason.  And it was OUTSTANDING!  It was a perfect portion.  My Dad had the ravioli and he enjoyed it as well.  We each had a salad, which tasted better than it looked.  I thought it was very strange the way they cut up the lettuce.  But it was good.  I loved the raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  I will definitely be back here quite a bit.",

Our server suggested we order from the specials and we ordered the French dip sandwhich. The baguette was warm and crispy that held up well with the au jus and the meat was seasoned perfectly. Now the french fries had to be hands down the most perfect french fries I've had in a long time. They where crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The seasonings they used was so perfectly balanced that no ketchup was needed. We also ordered the baked brie. Now I had seen recipes for baked brie all over pintrest and needless to say I was excited to see if the taste lived up to the pictures. The pastry was flakey and the cheese creamy. It was accompanied by apples and grapes that just balanced out the cheese!!! I will have dreams of baked brie! Last but not least you can't come to this place and not get a glass of wine. I had a Monchoff Riesling that was recommended by our server that was absolute perfection!",

We, a party of 4, were seated @7:25 for our 7pm reservation. Our waiter took our food order around 8pm. Eventually we got a loaf of bread and two of the ordered salads. By 9pm still no entree, although our waiter apologized and offered more drinks from the bar. At 9:30, he returned to say it would be at least another half-hour and that their kitchen was behind. We could hear the sound of crashing plates in the kitchen plus lots of cussing by the wait staff. By 10pm, we left ... only bread, water, a cocktail... starving. And no apology or explanation from the management. We were very disappointed; certainly not a good impression for this new location.",

The dining room behind the bar is cozy & nice. However the main dining area in front of the bar is casual, noisy, crowded. Great for happy hour and dining with friends or lunch but not great for couples or anyone wanting to have a decent conversation without raising your voice.   The wine list booklet looked like a 2 year old had been playing with it tattered torn & written on. We waited forever just to get water & bread. The waitress could not give any info on wine. We had to ask for water refills every time, was never offered additional bread or asked if we wanted to order additional drinks or wine. Took 20 min to get salads out.  Waited for food over 30 minutes. Busboy would take 1 dirty dish at a time but leave 2-3 others on table.   Waited about 15 minutes for check when we were done with dinner, then was charged for wrong wine, got that corrected but had to wait another 10 minutes for waitress to return to pay the bill. We finally asked busboy to get the waitress just so we could pay and leave.   Looks like Grape Street Too needs to invest more time in training their wait staff. Have always had a great dining experience at original Grape Street. Very disappointed!",

Nick was a very good server and was attentive without being intrusive. He even gave me a taste of a wine I did not order to give me more exposure. He picked wines that were interesting and challenging. I will definitely be back to see him! Thank you very much Nick!",

    "text": "The food was Five STAR all the way. I had the short rib. Amazing. The service though was less then. The bus boy was 5 star but other things just did not make sense.  I asked what kind of NA beer they had and was told St Pauli which I like. I was brought a brand I did not know and as the waiter was pouring it, I was told this was a substitution. I was TOLD. I was not asked. It ended up being fine but that is not my point.  The salads came out. They were all delivered to the wrong parties. There should be seat numbers assigned so that they wind up in the right place. Mine was not part of the initial delivery and since mine had not been delivered yet, it was my intent to ask for anchovies for my Caesar salad. When I asked about my salad the guy delivering the salads stated, \"I only have two hands\". Wrong answer. Very rude response. Salad showed up and the anchovies a few minutes later on the side.  The entree's came out while we were still eating our salads. Poor timing.  Then I had no utensils as they took all of them from me with the bread plate though I was not done with the bread.  Lastly, never once in an hour and a half were we asked if we wanted more beverages. I was with a guy who spent $700 on wine alone the night before. I was never offered another beer and though ONE bottle of wine was split between the table, not once were we asked if we wanted more. You lost a few hundred dollars on this visit.  Like I said, the food was great but it was as if the \"B\" or \"C\" team was on duty.  Why is your average only three stars with as long as you have been in Vegas, especially when the food is always amazing, so amazing I will be back. With that said, if poor service is bringing you down, you are losing business.  With so many restaurants in Downtown Summerlin located next to the Red Rock Casino and you look for great restaurants on the Yelp app, how many Yelpers are going to run to a three star restaurant?  I will tell you to go there for the food but it is a coin toss on the service",

Unfortunately the food didn't match the place/service.  I ordered just a plain ol' cheeseburger and had to send it back twice!  I am NOT picky, and I hate sending things back.  However, I ordered my burger \"'medium rare\" and the first time it came out well done.   I took a couple bites, was going to just accept it, and the manager insisted on re making it.  Waited for about another 10 minutes for the new burger to come.  Once it came, cut it in half, it was rare.  And when I say rare, I mean cold in the middle.  The manager came back again, and apologized as she felt the inside of the burger.  She said her \"crew just wasn't on tonight\", so she comped our \"12 dollar\" burger, but we still left paying $170.00 tab and I ended up stopping at N-N-Out to eat dinner since I never got one.

I had higher expectations for this place...  :(  I ordered the Orange Chicken Chinese Salad & what I got was a \"strange\" salad bombarded with way too many crushed wontons!! It felt & resembled like I was eating a bowl of Kellogg's Corn Flakes without the milk!!! Also, there was hardly any chicken (explains the excess of crushed wontons) and the few miniature cubes of diced chicken tasted like a frozen chicken breast that was microwaved...bland & boring!! The salad also had roasted red bell peppers and some pieces were crunchy raw & other pieces were mushy as if they came straight out of a jar marinated in olive oil!! I haven't had roasted red bell peppers in a Chinese chicken salad before!! It was like they were adding it as an excuse for an \"Italian twist\" because this restaurant's food theme is \"Italian\"...very bizarre!!   My friend ordered the Black Salmon salad & it was very good!! I should of had that instead!! As for their drinks, although well made, the size glass you get is way too small for what they charge. You can get a larger size drink on the Vegas strip for the same price Grape Street charges for their drinks!!  Due to the beautiful ambiance, good service and the saving grace of my friend's Black Salmon Salad, I will give Grape Street another chance. I will just make sure to steer clear of the very strange \"Italian wannabe\" Orange Chinese Chicken Salad!!",

I ordered it cooked medium, it came out mostly well done and chewy and with very little meat.  This place has been steadily going down hill in service and quality, and they are becoming dirty. I read that they had a C and a B rating from the Clark County Health District in the last 2 months...public information, which can be looked up. I will not be eating here anymore.",

The server was kind enough to provide a glass or 2 of vino at no charge due to the shortage of menu items, which was great. Soooo then, at a slightly expensive wine-centric place, is it really necessary to have TV's EVERYWHERE, showing football....and servers shouting about whatever the hell they were happy or not about in the game? I didnt intend to go to a sports bar. I appreciated the server and the meal, although the sea bass was my 2nd choice, but the football games blaring, ie. lack of ambiance was a deal breaker. Won't be back.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to take my husband to Grape Street for awhile, but alas, with 5 kids, free time is almost non existent! My dad was visiting from out of town and urged us to get out of the house, so we ventured to Downtown Summerlin and made our way to Grape Street. The decor and ambiance is nice, and the hostess was nice. We were seated and greeted in a good amount of time. It seemed there was some confusion over who was serving us for a minute, but we ended up with Brice. He wasn't overly friendly and seemed like his mind was elsewhere. I ordered the greek salad with chicken, and my husband ordered a cheeseburger. The food came fairly fast, but it was just such a dissapointment. The salad was barely dressed,  and looked like a handful of spring mix, 2 cubes of feta, a peppercini and 5 shreds of chicken. For $21, I was expecting better than that. Panera's is cheaper and tasted better! My husband's cheeseburger was undercooked but he ate the fries, which were good. Our server didn't check on us to ask how the food was either. My husband doesn't like sending food back because he is convinced every server is from the movie Waiting, so he wouldn't order anything else. The busser asked how he liked the untouched burger, and we said it was undercooked. He didn't convey that to the server, because the burger was still on the bill and he made no mention of it to us at all. I struggle with poor customer service, because I am in the hospitality  industry myself, and my workplace is all over us about paying attention to detail. That seems to be non existent here, or at least the night we dined there. We didn't fuss over the bill, but it was definitely a poor experience. We won't be coming back. I was almost more disappointed a rare date night was a total bust. On to the next! In another year or two.",

The server offered us a new plate   AND THEN FUCKING CHARGED US FOR TWO PASTAS BRUH  How is it possible that an establishment making probably tens of thousands of dollars a month doesn't have the decency not to charge a table for two pastas rather than one?   We paid, and tipped our server because we aren't slimy degenerates; don't waste your time eating at this rat run sad excuse of a \"romantic\" restaurant.   I didn't want to throw a scene and complain, I just don't want anybody else expecting anything more than a one star experience.  The food was a 6/10. Both plates.",

Visited on a Friday night around 8Pm, made a reservation and was seated immediately, place was moderately busy but seating was available either on the outdoor patio or indoor.   Seated, servers came right over to take drink orders and inform us of specials. The servers were all very professional punctual and friendly. Service was quick.  For dinner I had the grilled cheese and fries. It was great! Grilled cheese in untraditional. It's like a ricotta cheese on a long roll. It was a nice change from a regular grilled cheese and made me feel fancy. Fries were seasoned nicely. Wish they had honey mustard as a dressing option, but again fancy casual.   For dessert I had the tiramisu, W-O-W... easily the best tiramisu I have EVER had. Was the perfect blend of cake and cream with out being soaked. Loved every bite of it.   Menu is extensive with seafood, pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, etc. something for everyone.  Prices are on the higher side but well worth what you pay for what you get. Portions were perfect.   Would definitely return!",

It seems like they may have made it far in advance and forgot to season it. The lettuce had given up on life.  It was served with sliced avocado that was so under ripe that it was hard and bitter.  They were nice about taking it off of my bill. I was running late for a movie, so I didn't order anything as a replacement.   I'm giving them one extra star because their service was good, even though they were obviously busy. I also really appreciated how friendly the personnel was at the hostess stand. I also really liked my cocktail and the bread.",

Our group had a lunch reservation and I understand that things are more difficult with big groups. However, there was one person in our group who didn't get her pizza with the rest of us.  Most of the menu items including my favorites from the Lake Mead location can be enjoyed here such as Baked Brie, Blackened Salmon Salad, Grilled Cheese (goat cheese...mmmm...), Eggplant Parm, etc. The execution and portions aren't the same though. The calamari had a few pieces, Baked Brie was small. Chilean Sea Bass was salty. Sesame Ahi Salad was just right though.  It was quite disappointing. We were all almost done with our meal before the person who ordered the pizza got her food. I had to ask to speak with the manager about the whole experience. He had that \"what do you want me to do about it?\" look on his face. The lack of experience, care and perception is disturbing. Plenty of room for improvement here.",

To start, there was a hour and half wait. Which really wasn't all that bad because you're in a mall! so actually went down to the Crave and had a few drinks at the bar. When we came back it was basically time to be seated.   Took about 15 minutes just to get water. Once the waiter came we ordered right away because we were almost sure the food was going to take forever. It actually didn't. Food came out a reasonable amount of time. The thing that didn't was my friends cocktail she ordered. After 30 minutes in they finally told her they didn't have that particular drink. Then she wanted a beer which came AFTER we were already done with our food.   I ordered the Filet Oscar. Got my meat medium rare. Nope, that was as well done as can be! The meat was sitting on mashed potatoes with crab on top of the meat, topped with asparagus which everything was swimming in a sauce. honestly, the whole dish was nothing special. For $38 I really hoped it would be Amazing. My dish came out with a Caesar salad which also was bland. I know it's just a salad but there was basically no dressing.   The beau got the seared ahi tuna which he clearly enjoyed and devoured. And the dish looked real pretty!   I probably will not come back to this location. I would probably try the other location because they have the wine flights over there but not at this one.",

He gave us ample time to talk and we never felt rushed to put in our orders for food.

So lets just talk about the food. We just had appetizers at the bar but i will say the guy running the bar was awesome!!! he is a very talented individual so thanks for making our experience awesome with your skills..  Calamari 3/5-just your typical  calamari with marinara sauce. Nothing special. Crab Stuuffed Shrimp 2/5- overcooked shrimp no <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrab.it&s=3154e001a528afefd7054a27ccbb027b5c1f727764940863c3357a1baab23dad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crab.it</a> was more like crabflavored stuffing. Caprese 4/5- One of the better caprese salads ive had.. the pine nuts gave the dish a great balnce of flavor.  Really i think i might have came here at the wrong time and probably should try it here for dinner and eat some other dishes because giving a review based on appetizers doesnt really feel like i know what im talking about but also if i was at a table i would probably be more inclined to order more food because when you sit at a bar you dont have alot of space.

    "text": "Came here for the first time on a weekday evening to enjoy some appetizers and wine. The wine selection is decent, but I felt for something named \"Grape Street,\" they probably should have had at least 50% more to chose from. Though the wall of wine was mesmerizing and distracting, so that may be a minor complaint in the scheme of things. We ended up ordering two bottles of wine, and they were both great, though maybe $10 or so overpriced.   Our server was great, he was very attentive, professional and friendly. He was incredibly knowledgeable about all of the food and wine, and helped us make good selections with both. No complaints on the staff end. Though it was a little annoying that we were seated next to the bar and some off-duty kitchen employees were clearly hanging at the bar because the staff kept congregating near them and ended up making the area around our table a little more crowded than it needed to be.   The food, we only had appetizers, was pretty solid. The baked brie was, as everyone else has raved, pretty amazing, and I couldn't stop eating it. The interior (including the bathroom) was clean and well maintained. I'd recommend this as a good place to go after work for drinks with your colleagues.",

Better than other gluten-free pizzas I've had.  My fiancee got the cobb salad which was fine too (for salads, that is).   Good beers on draft. I tried the cider, which I wouldn't recommend because it was way too sweet.  Great spot to stop by before the movies!",

The service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for the food.  Beverages were refilled regularly.

My daughter and I were looking for an early dinner on a Saturday evening and this place was perfect. I must say that we experienced incredible service, the best I have ever had from this restaurant. Our server checked on us the right amount of times you would need and the food was tasty and consistent with the other location. I really enjoy their version of Chicken Marsala and the house salad and loved the change in the dish they had made. The house salad is always so delicious, and it never fails to impress. The wine choices are top notch and I enjoy the variety they offer.   I will continue to patronize this location since it is closer to my home, but my heart will always wander back to the original location at Lake Mead/Buffalo.",

I asked the guy at the front desk about this and he said that they try to keep the windows open for the \"cool vibe.\"  Not cool if you are too hot to enjoy your meal and wine.  He really did not seem to care at all.  About the food, I had the Penne ala vodka with shrimp.  The shrimp was borderline tasteless and tiny.  I well remember this dish at the Lake Mead location, and it was stellar.   We are scheduled to have dinner on Wednesday.  I will call first to see if I need to wear shorts and a tee shirt.

    "text": "Went on a whim after doing some Christmas shopping. I wanted to try it and was not dissapointed, We were greeted and sat very quickly.  Everyone that came to the table was always happy to help and even got a visit from the manager. The wait staff was very attentive but not intrusive .Its always nice to see the managers out and pro active instead of only showing up when theres a problem. We got a great recommendation on the best wine pairing for our chosen entrees. We started with the calamari which was fantastic!  Husband got the salmon and from the one bite I was able to steal it was absolutely wonderful. The \"house salad\" he got with his meal was like a chopped salad with everything mixed in already along with the dressing. I liked the idea but too many onions.  I got a lighter roasted turkey sandwich which was very good. It came with a pasta salad which I found odd but personal preference I suppose. The prices were fair and not over inflated which I was very happy to see. We foregoed desserts but there were some good offerings and hopefully will have an opportunity to try them on our next visit.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that we went on a Sunday night, early, with a party of five.  We had called ahead to put our name in (no reservations for less than 8) and when we arrived, we were seated immediately at a large table.  From there on out, it was just great in all aspects. Our server was attentive and courteous, as well as helpful, and the wine steward who brought our bottle of wine was great to deal with.  Everyone we came in contact with was what you would hope for when dining.  The decor is great, and the wine wall is an eye magnet for sure.  The only drawback is the noise, which is mainly due to the two floor ceilings and the lack of anything to baffle the sound anywhere.  The music was not intrusive, but as the place filled up, the noise level rose.  This is not a place you would come to chat, or have a serious conversation, but if you go in knowing that then the atmosphere is just fine.  The menu is identical to the other location, and is equally as good and consistent from the appetizers to the desserts.  I realize others have had some very disappointing experiences, but we were very pleased and will go back.  They even put the items to take home in paper bags, so no nasty plastic or styrofoam!",

    "text": "Have eaten at the Lake Mead location several times, however this was my first visit to Summerlin location.  Restaurant is beautiful; open and bright.  However, service was terrible and food was lackluster.  We went for lunch; it was just moderately busy, midweek!  After being seated, it took at least 10 minutes for water and for waiter to take our drink order, then another 10+ minutes to take our order.  We ordered eggplant Parm sandwich, steak salad and Gorgonzola chicken pasta.   It took forever for food to arrive!  Two nearby tables that ordered were seated and ordered after us received their meals before us.   No waiter or busboy came by to refill water or take additional drink orders.  A second glass of wine may have been ordered had he done so.   Fellow diner said chicken pasta was good, but not spectacular.  Steak on steak salad looked to be burnt, very charred and dark.  Eggplant sandwich had little flavor.  Ration of filling to bread was horrible.  It was mostly bun with a small piece of eggplant and spoonful of marinara. We won't be in a hurry to go back anytime soon!",

Upon walking up to the bar the bar staff asked us if we were dining in the dining room. We explained that we were there to meet friends and wished to stay in the bar area. Immediately the bar staff began eye rolling and had no problem making us feel uncomfortable. Our friends arrived, we asked the bartender for happy hour drink specials and he literally laughed at us and said \"we don't have happy hour here and neither does anywhere in DT Summerlin. We are soooo busy we don't need a happy hour menu.\" Clearly not impressed with his attitude. Proceed to order apps and drinks. Food was great as always but it became so crowded inside that I understood why the bar staff didn't want us to stay in the bar. My check was incorrect 3 times- we were charged for the person next to us and asked for it to be corrected. That took another 20 minutes and came with a lot of attitude. Overall vibe of patrons inside was frustration so maybe they just need to work out the kinks but we prefer the old location for now.",

    "text": "Very loud inside, hostess was dressed like she should be working at Sapphires, drink order took a long time to get to us...  The food was so so.  The Calamari had to much breading on it and was a little on the chewy side, my burger was done to my liking on the inside but had way to much char on the outside (the char taste overwhelmed everything else), my wife's grilled cheese was more like grilled roasted red peppers than anything else.  Our waitress was nice, but watching her she got frustrated to quickly and it showed it too much (perhaps just a bad day).  In addition I ordered a beer that the menu said was $7 on draft, was told it was not on draft and only in a bottle, when i got the bill it was $8 instead of $7.  It is a $1, not that big of deal...  I am not sure if they are going through a hard time because it is a new location if if they just aren't as good as everyone says.  Sadly I have to lean more towards the latter of the two as I was never impressed with the original location either.",

    "text": "I really had high hopes for this new location which fell flat.  When the waiter notified our table that the wine we ordered was out of stock, he offered an alternative that was more than 30% more expensive.  There was also no discount given for the up-sale. With the sky-high markups on wine, the price difference still had the restaurant making a profit.  It's a common practice many other restaurants make when they're sold out to offer to eat the price difference.  It just made us feel like they were trying to up-sell us.  The food prices were a little steep for the quality.  On your next trip to Downtown Summerlin you're better off heading to Crazy Pita with a bottle of wine from Trader Joe's.",

People next to us who arrived way after us finished their salad and was into their meal. I went up to the hostess and politely told her that I think our waiter had forgot about us. 5 minutes later he came to our table and said that he didn't forget about us (awkward), that the chef has messed up our order. But had that been the case... No worries, just let us know. Or fill up our drinks. Or fill our bread basket. But no, nothing. Salad finally came, then entree within 5 minutes before we even got the pepper on our salad (pet peeve). Anyhow, food was mediocre, salad dressing was wrong. Didn't bother to apologize. Definitely will take our business elsewhere next time. The wine was good though! After I finally got it.",

The food was scrumptious! My sister had the short ribs which was so tender that she could cut it with a fork. We both had the sauteed spinach which complemented our entrees very well. My wild halibut was moist, flaky and very tasty cooked with Cajun spices served with a delicious ratatouille. And, yes, Brennan is a terrific waiter who recommended the special entrees and provided us with outstanding service with a smile!",

    "text": "We came here on a Tuesday night and although it was very busy and we didn't have a reservation, we had almost no wait.  The hostess was pleasant and asked how our night was on the way to showing us our table which was right next to the windows making it prime real estate for people watching.  We used to always go to the original Grape Street on Lake Mead but wanted to wait a few weeks before checking out this new location because of the adjustment period.  I read some of the reviews, everybody mentioned the noise level.  I mean, it's not like the music was loud, it was a packed restaurant, I'm not sure what everybody expected.  We had a nice booth and all the privacy we needed to carry on an intimate conversation.  Anyway, on to the food and service.  Waiter was great, LITERALLY smiling every time he came to our table.  I know from experience the baked brie takes longer to fire up and he also gave us the heads up in case we were unaware.  He threw that in immediately while we perused the menu.  The manager/wine director stopped by our table because we mentioned to our waiter that we were going to have some wine but were unsure.  Bobby (I think that was his name? Bad memory...) was told this so he wanted to help us decide.  Myself and my girl, honestly, you could give us boxed wine and we won't complain.  We're easy like that.  He took the time to go over almost every wine they carry and match it up with whatever potential entree we were going to order.  I know he was busy and he had other stuff to do, but the commitment to assisting our wine decision was impressive.  We ultimately ordered a bottle and couldn't have been happier.  For food, in addition to the baked brie, we had the steamed clams, chicken gorgonzola and grilled chicken caesar.  All were great and came out quickly.  The chicken gorgonzola I ordered with blackened chicken by our waiter's recommendation and it wasn't too spicy, just perfect.  I like the clams because I enjoy dipping the bread in the broth and the Caesar tastes just like the original location's.  All in all, this was a great experience.  Like I mentioned, we were already partial to the original location, but this new one is even closer and considering that it is in the very popular downtown summeriln, we will definitely be coming to this new one from now on. The service was great from the hostess to our waiter to the wine sommelier.    We will be back as long as the experience is always like this one.",
