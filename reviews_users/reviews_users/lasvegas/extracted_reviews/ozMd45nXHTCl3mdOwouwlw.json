We ordered for delivery and believe it or not all our plates were so hot and fresh!!!! A total excellence in customer satisfaction!!! I've placed my order twice already with a very lovely woman \"Angela\"... she greets you with a very warm and welcoming vibe!

    "text": "Shawarma House is a much needed addition to this part of town! There are a few options around the area for Mediterranean, but Shawarma House is doing it right as far as the customer service and taste of the food offered. Inside is clean and they have tables and chairs with napkins and salt and shakers at each table. Sodas come in a can ($0.99 cents each) and they have bottled options (from $1.49 to $1.99) as well. From 2 pm until 4 pm (Monday - Friday) they have a Happy Hour that is worth checking out. The employees are very friendly and will offer you a sample if you aren't sure about something on the menu. I have placed to-go orders on my visits and the wait wasn't very long.   Lentil Soup, House Salad and Pita ($5.99 during Happy Hour) - The HH price was very reasonable. The lentil soup had great flavor and worth trying out if you like that type of soup. The salad was a smaller version of their Armenian Salad and was good, but lacking the feta cheese that was offered for an additional $2. I thought it was silly to pay that much for the smaller version and declined politely. The pita was good and I liked the amount they gave and that it was warmed.   Armenian Salad with Feta ($7.99 for full order) - This was a mixture of Armenian cumbers, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and oil and vinegar. The full salad is only $5.99 if you don't want feta cheese, but I recommend it. The salad had a fresh taste and they put a good amount of feta. The only bummer about this salad is that it doesn't come with any pita, which I am used to at other restaurants. It's an additional $0.49 cents for each pita. I also like tzatziki which comes in a half ($3.99) or full order ($5.99) sizes, but I didn't want that big of a portion, I just wanted a side of it. The girl who took my order gladly rang me up for a small side of tzatziki at $0.49 cents and it tasted really good. Definitely try the tzatziki if you like that sort of thing.   Chicken Shawarma Slider ($1.99 each) - I was curious about how their chicken tasted and this was the perfect way to do just that. The pita was made in-house and the little pita pocket had chicken, tomato, lettuce and garlic sauce. The chicken had great flavor! I really love that they do not use pre-made frozen meat like some other places use. They actually season the meat themselves and layer it on the spit. The garlic sauce was good and the pita fell apart a bit, but was good also.   This place is worth checking out and they do offer delivery aside from the option of dining inside or taking your order to-go.",

    "text": "Since my trip to Kuwait, I have been searching for a place to satisfy my need for delicious shawarma! This is about our 4th attempt at a new shawarma place and this place doesn't disappoint.   It may not be the best I've had in Vegas but it is definitely worth the mention.   The pricing you'd see at any shawarma place is about the same at the place. My biggest complaint is the $3 tiny bowl of rice you get when you order it as a side but no biggie. I'm big on rice so rice quantity is important to me.   The chicken in my chicken / rice meal was delish. Moist and cooked just right. Of course, my rice was out way before my chicken was but that's where my $3 of extra rice comes in. 4/5  My wife's chicken shawarma wrap was a decent size and was pretty delish too. No complaints coming from her.  The lady that took our order was super nice and friendly. Checked on us and made sure we were doing OK.  Nice joint, facility is nicer than most of the shawarma places we've visited.   Two thumbs up. Will definitely go back when I need a shawarma fix.",

I didn't remember if I had liked the food and shawarma sounded delicious so I put in an order.   I ordered beef shawarma, baba ganoush, and kibbeh.   Beef Shawarma: the meat the sent was not freshly made. It was luke warm and tasted like it had been made earlier in the day.  Baba ganoush: really strongly spiced and oddly sour. Not like baba ganoush I have made or eaten elsewhere. I didn't enjoy this version. I think there was too much lemon.  Kibbeh: was just meh.   The garlic sauce and hummus were tasty. I don't think I will order from here again.",

    "text": "Moral behind my long story - if you are aware that EAT24 has incorrect information and someone orders from EAT24 - you should have called to confirm that I knew what I was getting...instead of trying to upsell me, tell me I should have called instead of using EAT24, and kept comparing themselves to other companies...even though I never said anything about other companies.   I have been to Shawarma House several times and the food is always delicious and always have the same lovely lady at the front desk. I am giving a three star due to the way I was \"upsold\" due to a EAT24 mistake, which I understand Shawarma House is not totally to blame. EAT24 states that falafel comes with 2 sticks where Shawarma house only offers 1 stick for their side order. I arrived to pick up my order and expressed my concern because it would not have been enough for my lunch. ( Shawarma House called to let me know pick up was ready but if they KNEW they were having those issues - they should have confirmed with me over the phone- and in that case I would have told them to change my order). I ended up spending way more than I should have. I would have gotten something different if I knew I was going to spend $4.00 on 2 Falafel sticks. The lady there tried to say \"well we give you special garlic sauce and other locations use power and we make our food fresh so you get what you pay for\" \"I told her that I ordered everything vegan so the garlic sauce would not work for me. She then told me that for an additional dollar, she could add a third stick. The issue should have been corrected right then and there and then Shawarma house should have handled it directly with EAT24 to get the money back, instead she told me to contact EAT24 and request a refund.   At least the DOLMAS WERE ON POINT TODAY! YUM.  EAT24 responded and said that the \"manager\" at Shawarma house said incorrect information:    Shena: I just spoke with the manager at the restaurant and he said it is $1.99/stick and that is why you only got 2 12:37pm  Jody M.: That is incorrect. 12:39pm  Jody M.: The manger told me to contact you directly and ask for a refund because they have contacted you several times in regards to this issue 12:39pm  Jody M.: EAT24 states Falafel sticks $1.99. Having the S on there would make it plural. 12:40pm  Jody M.: I ordered 2- expecting to get 4 sticks 12:40pm  Jody M.: Your order form has it plural. Your order form is incorrect per the manager there. 12:40pm  Jody M.: I would not have paid $1.99 for 1 stick 12:41pm  Shena: Unfortunately I can not made them change anything.  Jody M.: It has nothing to do with them. It has to do with you guys having incorrect information.",

    "text": "I obviously found this place through Yelp because I searched for new places around. I had to look around but if you're familiar with the area around Craig, you prolly be able to easily find it.   I was greeted by a man and a kid at the counter so I would assume that this is family owned and told me that they've only been open for 2 months now. I, myself, have tried a lot of Halal food especially in New York.   Today, I ordered the Lamb Chops combo for to go- rice, 4 lamb chops, half a tomato, yogurt salad and 1 pita bread for $15 + tax + tip, total of $18. I wasn't really impressed as the meat was dry- over cooked on the grill I guess, and it was bland. It didn't come with any white sauce in it and the yogurt salad was just ok. The pita bread didn't come with hummus and you would have to add $2 if you want one, which I think was not a good idea. Pita bread comes with hummus and hummus comes with pita bread!   Overall, this combo is very expensive for the area that they're catering for. In comparison, a Lamb Chop combo in NYC would only cost you $10, and the same box would give you overflowing rice and salad, 4 lamb chops and falafel!   They still have a lot of room for improvement. My suggestion is to lower the price OR increase the amount of 1 serving. Also, get a guy who really knows how to cook Mediterranean food. My lamb chop, as well as the meat on the grillers, were dry and bland. :(",

The cashier gave me a menu and I looked over it for a couple mins. I tried to find something that looked familiar to me that I had tried a couple years back. I chose Chicken Lula #5. Comes with rice, grilled tomato, a choice of salad, pita bread and a soda. You can add hummus for $1.99 extra, and I did just that cuz I gotta have hummus lol  I don't remember exactly how long I waited, had to be about 10-15 mins tho. I am extremely hungry since I didn't eat all day yet but they were all very nice so I don't mind waiting. The cook I'm assuming preparing the food in the back even said hi... Probably cuz I looked over. It seems to me he was training someone lol.   But once my food was ready and the cashier handed it to me OMG... It smelled SOOO good as I was walking out the door.  I'm eating it right now at this very moment. It's really good!! Good amount of food & for a decent price also. Less than $13 for the whole plate, bread and soda. Deeelish! I'm definitely coming back here when I want some more Mediterranean food. It's great cuz it's down from where I live too..finally!",

    "text": "TLDR: house made accompaniments; average priced entrees; excellent service  Upon the recommendation of 3 different people, I decided to make a couple of trips up north to visit this restaurant tucked in a strip mall.   I was greeted each time with a warm smile and friendly greetings. I noticed that the menu board had changed options slightly and I try to eat a balanced meal, whenever possible. As a pescatarian, I would like to see some seafood options, but the vegetarian options are just as good. I wanted the falafel plate, but it literally came with no vegetables except the pickled side dish. I decided to order the veggie skewer with a side of spicy tzatziki sauce. The spicy tzatziki is no longer on them menu, but they'll honor a request for it to be made if asked.   A side dish is recommended as there is a wait for your food to be ordered since it is made fresh. The spicy tzatziki is to die for: a must get. It pairs nicely with warm pits and even as a side to your meal. The Armenian salad was standard and not overly dressed. I was pleasantly impressed with the presentation and flavor of a veggie kabob. The nice char with the herbs and spices really uplifted the meal. I liked that the skewer was removed and plated well over the rice. I was underwhelmed with the rice as I really expected it to be more flavorful and maybe with more spices or herbs.   Regardless, I enjoyed my time and meal at this location. With the friendly service, I might come back for a lunch special or something under $10. I'll definitely be coming back with a friend.",

Checked several times to see if everything was to my liking. It was.   I had the steak kebabs. Seasoned but overly so. In fact, the whole meal could be described that way. Flavorful without any one thing overpowering the entire dish.   Next time I am in Vegas I  will plan my day  so I can try the gyros for lunch cause they looked delicious.",

The Shawarma House is pretty close. They cook the meat on the proper rotisserie machine. It was flavored different than I am use to, but it was good. The garlic sauce reminds me of the sauce the Greek restaurants use for the gyros, which I am not fond of. I did like the pita bread they use. They get it from California. You can't get good pita bread in Vegas.  Tabouli: Okay. The parsley was not chopped fine enough and it need more bulgar wheat, salt, and olive oil.  Grape Leaves: Excellent, The vegetarian grape leaves are served cold and were seasoned perfect.  Falafel Sandwich: Very Good. I would say it was excellent if it was served with tahini sauce, but they use their garlic sauce.  Baklava: Okay. It was okay. I have had better.  Hummus: Excellent!!  I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items. I recommend that you stop by and try this place. You won't be disappointed.",

The chicken is nice and juicy 4/5  Beef Kabob: For people like me who isn't a big fan of salty food, this is awesome. It comes with salad (I chose Tzatziki which is listed under salad), rice and pita...and a drink if you get the combo 4/5  Shawarma: Tasty and juicy meat + their delicious garlic sauce.

I believe that is all you need to know but Yelp thinks I need to keep writing and make this a longer review to help you decide to eat here or not. I already told you it was good! What else do you need to know? Besides half of the yelp reviews I read are crap and don't help me at all. You shouldn't take my word or anyone else's for that matter. You should drive in your car right over to Craig and Jones and walk into Shawarma House, say hello because that is polite and order some food. Then you eat the said food and realize you really enjoyed yourself.   After all this rambling on and on yelp is still telling me this review is only average length so I'm going to give up here. Bye",

I ordered the half Mediterranean salad, gyro plate and gyro sandwich with Mediterranean fries. The portion size for the salad after adding feta and olives was just the right size. The pita bread was tasty.  A little bit thicker than I like it but good. The gyro meat was seasoned perfectly and the tzatziki sauce was tangy and creamy. Totally enjoyed every bite. The fries were seasoned perfectly and very good. Too bad there wasn't more! Overall I would say for the price and taste worth every penny. I'm looking forward to trying this place again.",

The hummus is amazing and we love the turnip and pepper garnishes, as well. Only two small complaints: the tabbouleh is a little heavy on the parsley and the parsley needs to be chopped more finely, and the baklava is just a bit dry.  The service is friendly. The place is clean. All in all, a great little restaurant. We'll be back.  Updating with 5 stars. We've continued to dine here and they just keep getting better. The employees are so friendly and accommodating. We tried the baklava again recently and it was perfect--not the least bit dry.",

I wasn't quite aware of my current place in space and time, but I was only aware of my new, soft, single-minded pillow top mattress.  I had never slept so soundly in my life.  I fell into a deep slumber in which I dreamt of a succulent feast.  A layout fit for a sultan.  The smells and tastes the likes of which I had never quite experienced before.  I drooled so deeply that I awoke in a puddle of my own saliva.  When I came to, I realized that it wasn't my bed that caused me to dream so deeply.  Nor was it my craving for a feast that made me drool so terribly.  I was coming to scahwarma house for lunch the next day.  And nothing else mattered.  Damn this is bomb.",

I ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate - includes rice, hummus, pita bread, pickled turnips and a soda.  The beef is served over rice and is drizzled with garlic sauce.  The beef is so very flavorful on its own but with the garlic sauce it takes it to amazing!  The garlic sauce is so good you could put it on a shoe and eat the shoe.  The portion size of the beef and rice was spot on, perhaps generous for smaller appetites.  The hummus is made in house, in fact they were making a fresh batch when I walked in.  The consistency and flavor were very good.  I personally like a bit more garlic in my hummus but I added a bit of the garlic sauce from my plate and kicked it up a notch.  The only part that wasn't my favorite was the pickled turnips.  No big loss as I had more than enough food to satisfy me.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  It is counter service and they bring the food out to your table.  The beautiful woman, an owner perhaps, working the counter was a delight to chat with regarding the restaurant and the food.  She showed great pride in both and was kind enough to treat me to a baklava to bring home to my parents.  BTW - my parents had never had baklava and they absolutely loved it.  I can't wait for my next visit to LV and the Shawarma House.",

    "text": "I ordered the Sultani plate as it had a sampling of a lot of different items for $19.95:   The lamb was very good. It was supposed to be medium and was medium well to well, but they are very thin bone in chops so it would be almost impossible to get a perfect medium. It had good flavor and I would eat it again, but I've had better for less and with a better presentation.  The chicken was extremely dry and lacked flavor. It was very dissapointing and was left on the plate to be disposed of.  The steak medallions were supoosed to be medium, but came out well done. They were dry and lacked flavor. The dogs enjoyed them when we got home.  The Dolma lacked flavor and I doubt they were made in house. If they were, they weren't fresh.   The Kibbeh were fine, but dry.  Tomato. It's a tomato.  The rice was plain and didn't have any of the traditional spices I normally find when I eat Mediterranean food. It was also... very dry.  My plate didn't come with tzatzki or any type of sauce you would normally find.  I'm not sure if after paying $19.95, you are supposed to order them as sides. There were also no pita bread,  which I found odd.  My wife had the falafel wrap, which she didn't care for. The falafel came in sticks and the bottom portion was mushy and wet.   Overall, a below average dining experience. I am quite surprised to see all reviews saying it is the best Mediterranean food they have ever had.",

The place was clean and a nice atmosphere.   Aaaaaand the food was great. I really enjoyed it. Very fresh, well seasoned, a nice amount for the price. I got a gyro combo, with a side of the spicy tzatziki and normal tzatziki on the gyro. Should have done spicy on it and another side, the stuff was good!   Cons? Location, really. I could see people complaining about that, but I found it easily. Sadly people probably won't stumble onto them which is kinda sad. As far as the food, I'd add more zing to the normal tzatziki, maybe some more dill? I wanna say the meat needs more flavor but it doesn't, because it does well with the rest of the ingredients as is in my opinion. Not sure. But I don't have anything terrible to say about the place.  9/10, would spicy tzatziki again.",

I must say that the food is really good, especially the shwarma. It's hard to find quality shwarma especially here in Vegas. It reminds me of the food trucks that offer it in New York.   The customer service is great. They will explain things with a friendly face and patience. Quality food and great customer service stands out here. I will definitely be back when I need my shwarma fix. I hope they get Chicken Cream Chop like they were saying they were trying to get. I will be back.",

    "text": "Used to love this place so much, but was recently concerned by a series of events that happened. My wife and I ordered here when we had a craving and when they first opened,  we both voluntarily handed out their flyers and menus in our neighborhood. Last week or so, my wife was out with my daughter and I was home. My doorbell rang and to my surprise, Shawarma house was delivering to my house. I thought my wife ordered it and asked if that was the case. I asked, \" if she already paid and if she already tipped?\" The driver and owner told me it was all taken care of. So, I took the food and opened it and ate a piece of chicken. I called my wife to let her know her food was here and she said, \"What food?\" Uh oh! So I call them and tell them, \"You delivered to the wrong house.\" They asked if I wanted to buy it, but I didn't have the cash for it right then so I couldn't. They said they would send someone to pick it up......Mind you, I told them I ate out of it. Now, health wise and money wise, you're going to spend time and gas to pick up food I already ate out of.... Why????? To sell it anyway? To recycle it? To be petty? Why not say, I hope you like it, maybe this will get you to buy this off the menu next time. That's how you keep customers. I mean, what were you going to do with it? At that point, the best it could be is advertisement. Nope.. They picked the food up and lost a customer and my respect. Still kind of wondering what they did with that food?????",

I ordered a salad and their falafel sticks, got home and realized my salad didn't come with a side of tzatziki or dressing as expected- called about it and got heaps of attitude and defensive comments starting with, \"well if you read the menu you'd know\". Excuse me?! For the record, the salad is simply listed as \"shawarma salad\", and says nothing about the dressing, but if you can ask me if I want to pay extra for feta or olives (which arguably should be included in a $10 salad), you can ask about the dressing, too.   Salad was small with a sparse layer of lettuce and some dry chicken and not much flavor. Maybe it was an off day, but I'll probably think of Gyro Time or Baladie before returning here. Night and day difference from my last couple visits, hope it's not a new trend.",

Food: ordered Beef Shawarma wrap - it was good, needed more Tzaziki sauce (i think that's what it's called), as it was a bit dry. It came with picked \"veggies\" which was picked cabbage - it was not good. Fries were okay. Beef Kabob, opt for medium rare got well done. Cashier ask if he'd like to add feta cheese ($1.99) and olives ($.99) assuming it'll be a decent size salad, it was a tiny side. Not worth it. We also added hummus ($4.99) which btw didn't have the olive oil in the middle that were used to seeing in hummus, oh and they forgot to put pita. Overall it was okay but would go to Baladie cafe instead the next time craving strikes.",

The staff was very friendly and personable. The place is very clean too. They made our food fresh to order and every bit of it was delicious. We ordered the chicken lula with tzatziki and the chicken kabob with Armenian salad. Both preparations of the chicken was flavorful and moist. The rice is so tasty too, I could eat just that by itself for a meal. The Armenian salad was also delicious and the veggies in it were impressively fresh and crisp. We ordered both of the meals without the grilled tomatoes, so the staff surprised us with a couple of dips to try, the hummus was my favorite! We will definitely be back.",

Between the ground beef and ground chicken kabobs... They were both delicious, favorable, and juicy but I enjoyed the ground chicken the best!   I usually do eat pickled jalapeno but today I chose not to try the grilled jalapeno.   The grilled tomato had a gamey flavor that I wasn't a fan of.   The rice was actually really good too. I'm more of a sticker white rice kind of Asian, so trying something different is always strange. But I was surprised and I enjoyed it.  And for my salad I chose the Armenian salad with olives and feta cheese. Winner! I could totally do a whole plate of it.   My daughter has their kids chicken nuggets and fries...it was so good, she kept expressing how delicious it was.   I typically do not travel to the North side of Vegas, but I was in the area and the food looked good, so we stopped for lunch. We enjoyed our meal so much, i teased the owner that he needed to hurry and open one closer to Green Valley!   My enjoying my new found quest to finding good kabobs in the city!",

I ordered hummus but it did not arrive. I called the store and nicely let them know that my hummus did not arrive but that I got my pita bread. The person that answered the phone, Angela was very abrasive from the beginning and told me that my receipt did not reflect that I ordered hummus. I told her it must have been an error because I did click the button on the Yelp app. And she was very adamant and forceful about the fact that I did not order hummus and she could send me a copy of the receipt if I didn't believe her. Snarky! After our call disconnected I called back and asked if I can buy some hummus because that was what I was really craving. I had to keep de-escalating. I explained to her I'm in bed not feeling well. I didn't cook dinner I didn't want to go out of my house that's why I spent 40 plus dollars on food delivery. She was very curt and told me know they have a $10 minimum order and that they will not deliver it. I said you know this isn't about policy Angela this is about customer service it was an error and I'm asking you if I can please buy some hummus and she flat refused to sell me hummus unless I came and picked it up myself. I was shocked at how rude she was and poorly she dealt with a simple customer request. I waited an hour to get food, added the tip beforehand and was treated like sh*#. Never again.",

Walking in the staff was awesome and they greeted me and my friends with smiles. Ordered the food ( I got the beef shawarma wrap) and before we knew it the food was ready and my eyes were wide open because of the portion. Took the first bite and it was so appealing  and delicious. On to the sides, which include Armenian salad and tabouleh. Both were delicious and again the portions are great!   Summary: - The plate was delicious, portions were perfect and price was very fair. - Sides were delicious and appetizing and a great compliment to my wrap. - Staff was very nice and helpful  Million dollar question.. .Would I recommend this place?? HECK YEAH!!! I will see you when I visit from LA.  Thank you shawarma house!!!",

That compounded with the smell of the chicken and beef being cooked fresh over some sort of rotisserie, it was a great experience from the moment I stepped in. The service was fast and friendly and I didn't feel pressured to hurry up and make a decision, because I had no idea what kind of food shwarma was. After I finally made a decision and went with a beef shawarma wrap my buddy order the chicken and we split it. Both of them was very tasty! I give the beef a slight edge and my buddy really enjoyed the chicken. We also had hummus with a pita wrap and that was tasty as well. I ended up spreading hummus on my shawarma. All in all a very good experience and I will be coming back and now that I know that they deliver I will be enjoying them more often!",

The beef shawarma was dried out and the hummus was bland. Thankfully the tabouleh salad was good. I should also note, the gyro meat wasn't dry and definitely not as dry as the shawarma. The delivery guy was nice and friendly. You could tell he was of a Mediterranean background. I thought for sure by the reviews of this place it would be better.

    "text": "Went here today for lunch and my mouth is happy!    The price was right and the menu was just big enough to provide ample variety without straying from what they say they're about:  shawarma.  Walk in, go to the counter and order, then pick your seat.  The menu is right on the wall but if you need a little time, you can also grab one of the menus from the counter to review.  I didn't get the name of the lady behind the counter but she was very nice, as were the other employees we saw interact with customers.  Before we knew it our lunches were brought out freshly prepared and hot.  I tried the beef shawarma plate with spicy garlic sauce.  It came with the beef on top of rice, hummus, pickled veggies (cabbage, carrots and celery) and hot pita bread on the side.  I went with a colleague from work who ordered the chicken shawarma plate and we both left satisfied!  There was definitely enough food to put a strong lunchtime desire to rest.  The restaurant is a little small, but not cramped.  It was also very clean.  Located in a storefront, there's plenty of parking, even though there aren't a lot of spaces right in front.  No big deal though.  For the time we sat there, it seemed there were always a few spots open, and there are plenty more around the corner.  If it's time to eat and you're near the intersection of 95 and Craig Road, definitely give the Shawarma House a try!",

The chicken is flavorful and cooked perfectly served over yellow rice and a side of hummus also accompanied by grilled tomato and jalapeno with a side salad.  The baba ganoush is fabulous! Better than the hummus for me, I always order extra pita bread and it is delicious!!",

We ordered the Lamb combo plate which came w/ rice and a side salad, tomatoes and we also added the hummus for an extra 1.99. SO GOOD!   The lamb was tender, juicy and they made is rare just how I like it. It tasted great w/ the hummus on the side. You can tell it was fresh too. I highly recommend ordering the hummus w/ the bread as well. For our meal (we got 2 combos) was about $50 w/ taxes and tip. Each place lamb plate is $17.99. You can get it w/ a drink as well.   The staff there was friendly and courteous. They're very patient and gave feedback on all the dishes they liked and disliked. WHO DOES THAT! Rarely do we ever get honest feedback on certain dishes. We even got to try a sample of the hummus prior to adding it.   We highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic, inexpensive shawarma food. It's a far drive for anyone not in north Las Vegas or Centennial Hills, but totally worth it! :-)",

Our orders were: Chicken Kabob plate with Armenian salad (add feta and olives) Beef Gyro Wrap with fries 4 Falafel sticks and pita bread for the sides.  My chicken kabob was great! Good flavor, everything was cooked right, and it came with grilled jalapenos and a tomato. The rice was okay, nothing special.  The Gyro wrap order was messed up and came as a plate with rice and hummus instead of wrapped up in a pita with fries, but it was still tasty! Even with the mess-up, we still enjoyed our meal. The falafel sticks were awesome!!! My favorite part. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  The only down-side is that I found things to be little pricey for what we got, but it wasn't enough to keep us from coming back.  Service was great!",

I always get the chicken shawarma with spicy garlic sauce and baklava. The baklava is amazing with pistachio ice cream!",

    "text": "I found this little gem on Yelp (of course) while looking for something new in the N/NW and decided to give it a try. Man I am glad that I did. I ordered the Sultani Plate which come with 2 Lamb Chops, 2 beef & 2 Chicken Kebobs, 2 Kibbeh, 3 Dolmas, grilled Tomato & rice. LOTS of food for $19.95. I took 1/2 of it home. I asked the owner George (super nice guy) if I could substitute the beef & chicken kabobs for beef & chicken Lula (ground meat) and he gladly obliged. The Lamb Chops were fantastic!!, the Lulas were moist and flavorful as were the Kibbeh, and I don't really like Dolmas, but I ate all 3 of them lol. And if all that wasn't good enough, George told me that they have FREE delivery within 5 miles!! who does that!! Just remember to be generous and tip the delivery driver well, he is using his own gas and mileage on his car, and is bringing your lazy butt (and mine) our food. Please, Please, Please support this local restaurant,",

Had a beef Lula plate, the chicken shawarma plate, lentil soup, mantle an appetizer, and baklava for dessert. They're plates come with a drink and everything was delicious. Definitely better than baladi cafe which now is not even owned by the same sweet couple we know and love. Love they deliver w a $20 min n not charge extra within a 5 mile radius.

I originally wanted to go to The Shish Kabob house on west flamingo and it's our goto with my wife. But since we live in Centennial now the closest was Shwarma kabob.  As I got home ready to enjoy our food I noticed the chicken lula was dry and the chicken kabobs. It's like it was sitting out in a warmer for a couple hours and finally dried out. The rice was dry as well and we really didn't care for the salad.  Unfortunately, we won't come back again and will make the further trip to Shish Kabob house on w flamingo. It's always worth a trip over there.",

(We yelped Greek food)  Upon parking the signs/pictures in the window explaining the menu were extremely helpful as we have never stepped out for Mediterranean food.  We walked in and were immediately greeted with friendly and helpful staff who helped us along our Mediterranean culinary journey.  After a little contemplation we ordered the number 4, 9 and 11.  Also ordered baklava and shamali with walnuts.  The rice was simple yet seasoned perfectly with so much flavor I wanted to take it home. The lamb chops which I ordered medium were cooked to proper temp and were delicious. Everything on my plate from the roasted tomato to the pita was an experience that I will compare all my other Mediterranean endeavors with.  My wife and daughter were both extremely pleased with their menu selections as well and a return visit is in order.  We recommend the lamb chops, stuffed grape leaves and hummus, falafel and baba ganoush and crush the roasted tomato and jalapeno into that rice.   You will not be disapointed!!  This place is clean and friendly with outstanding food. We look forward to many returns to try all the offerings Shawarma House provides.",

The fries although on the small portion size were good and crispy and had plenty of seasoning on them. He gave me free pistachio ice cream.

The only minor issue is that when I ordered the chicken kabob, I forgot to ask for garlic sauce. I am not sure if the garlic sauce is extra or if the garlic sauce comes as a salad choice. If you order the chicken kabob plate, make sure to ask about the garlic sauce, otherwise the plate may taste a bit dry.",

For some reason, there are blinking Christmas lights hanging from the drop ceiling. I'm not judging!  lol!    The five stars are definitely for the food and the friendly staff.

I had heard good things about their shawarma fries so that was my meal of choice.  The gyro-meat shawarma fries with tzatziki sauce were salty and delicious.  The bed of fries were sprinkled with Mediterranean-style seasonings, although as mentioned above they were a bit too salty.  Nevertheless, the fries were cooked perfectly and became a great base for this dish.  I chose the gyro meat (over beef or chicken) and it was a great choice...tender, seasoned nicely and fresh of the spit.  Covering all of this was a generous portion of tangy, bitey, garlicky tzatziki sauce.  This was the equivalent of Greek nachos and they went down easy. ;-)  Would definitely love a return trip, in order to try various other dishes on their menu.  Hope I can make that happen!",

We also tried their French fried which are really yummy that are seasoned really really well. We got the Taziki sauce to go with it. The spices and the creamy flavor went really well together.

The fries were spiced perfectly and my falafel pita was delicious. The falafel had a different seasoning than commonly found in Mediterranean restaurants, perhaps mint, that added positively to the flavor. The hummus was typical of Greek restaurants, but the serving was ample and there was plenty of accompanying pita slices.  We were served by a kind woman who seemed genuinely interested in us enjoying our lunch experience.",

    "text": "Shawarma House has been my go-to takeout restaurant for a while. It's a breeze to order them on Yelp. My favorite entries are the Gyro Plate and the Lamb Chops Kabob. They are too amazing.   Gyro plate has your choice of meat, rice, hummus--plenty much for one person. The meat was super tender and flavorful which is perfect when eaten together with the fluffy rice. I like to add some hot sauce (i.e. Sriracha) to the mix to make everything dance in my mouth. The pita bread is soft and has that chewy texture that I really like. Gyro plate is probably what I ordered the most often.   Lamb Chops is the greater indulgence. At 17.99 plus tax, you get four big lamb chops perfectly cooked medium rare. The meat is always juicy and the succulent lamb taste lingers around which compels you to take another bite. I think medium rare is the default; they don't ask you \"how would you like your lamb chops\" but medium rare is what I consistently get.  Mind you my review is based only on food that was delivered, which probably means that the food could be even better if you go to the actual restaurant and eat your food right away. Overall, a solid place and a perfect excuse to stay away from cooking after a long exhausting day.",

I loved the freshness of the taboulleh & the armenian house salad.  Nicely flavored dolmas deff hit my Mediterranean craving in the right spot.      I felt I spent my money well for the value of the food.    The service was gracious & the environment was very clean.  I also enjoyed the Armenian pop music they were playing.    I am grateful to witness a well ran family owned business in North Las Vegas.",

ITS ONLY THE MOST BASIC GREEK FOOD EVER! they don't make one. the rice looks ok, it was super bland (salt isn't going to fix this blandness), the grilled veggies were gross, (how about cutting the tomato before you give me a whole roma tomato grilled.)  by the way one, over grilled roma totmato isn't grilled veggies.  the 3 dollar dessert was super small, the mad greek gives you twice as much. and doesn't charge near as much.  OVERPRICED.  BLAND. POORLY PREPARED, SMALL DESSERT PORTION.    the pitas were delish, but they wont bring me back.  IT VEGAS YOU GET ONE CHANCE.  never again.",

So we get there just at 20 minutes and they're still making the food, no problem! But ten minutes later they were still making it. Anyways, we eventually get our order...beef shawarma sandwich, chicken shawarma plate, and Mediterranean fries. Husband said the beef shawarma was decent, but my chicken shawarma was tasteless and dry. The rice it came with tasted old and stale. It also came with \"pickled vegetables\" which turned out to be mostly pickled cabbage that seemed to come straight out of a can. The hummus was drowned in oil and gritty in texture. The med fries were good! Just French fries with some seasoning on top. I had also ordered a side Armenian salad with no dressing..but turned out to be swimming in dressing.  We likely won't be coming back because of the poor food quality. Also, it's annoying when a to go order is messed up.",

Especially a first time customer who is taking their time to make sure they get what they want. I mentioned the nuggets they had on the menu and she made me feel like there was a problem with me looking at that selection? Loved the young gentlemen after who spoke to me.

If I could afford to eat here everyday or go on some kind of life time payment plan I seriously would. Ha!   First off I love the staff who works there. Everyone is so nice and I've had some really nice conversations with the girl who takes your order. She remembers me and other customers and always makes a point to say hello and wave if she is working in the back. Love that!  Now on to their delicious food. Oh boy, I just love it. The meat is spiced to perfection, tender, and the portion size is perfect. I also like that if you get the beef kabob they will cook it to the temperature you request. I usually get mine medium rare and it actually  comes out that way. They understand temperature better than some of the upscale steak houses I've been to. Never once has my steak been over cooked! Good job guys!  Little by little I've been going down the menu and trying everything. It's no joke I eat here all the time. Everything has been delicious. My favorites at the moment is the steak kabob and I LOVE their roasted jalepenos and tomatoes. I'm a big fan of their spicy garlic sauce and I end up dipping everything in it. From the hummus to the toubuleh salad everything is fresh and scrumptious.   Fun fact, if your order is $50+ you can choose from a Shwarma House beanie or coffee cup. I have both hahaha! Small stuff like that makes me smile and let's me know they care about their customers.  Thanks Shwarma House, love your food!",

    "text": "Friday night, my boyfriend wanted to go out and get some food. We were debating between Shawarma House and the Great Greek in the NorthWest Las Vegas. We ended up selecting the Shawarma House based on all of the awesome Yelp community reviews for this restaurant.  Shawarma House is relatively easy to get to. The cross-streets are Craig and Jones. You can easily take the 95 to Craig and it's about a 5 minute drive to Shawarma House.  The menu is pretty short and simple. You can choose from a variety of plates (gyro, chicken etc..). You can also choose from Kabobs and Wraps. There are a few appetizers you can select from as well!  My boyfriend choose to Shawarma Fries with chicken meat topped with their special garlic sauce. I selected the Chicken Lula plate (a first for me!) and for an appetizer we got the Kibbeh (fried stuffed with ground beef).  It was somewhat inexpensive, total to roughly $40.00 with 2 soft drinks included. It took about 20 minutes for the order to come out. Our appetizer came out in about 18 minutes, immediately followed by our entrees.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the Shawarma Fries. There was large portion of fries, chicken, and perfect amount of garlic sauce topping. He ended up eating all of it at the restaurant!! I didn't particular care for the chicken lula. I thought the spices was a little off. My boyfriend ended up eating my lula. I did have the hummus and pita, which was scrumptious. The Hummus had a similar profile to that of Sabra Hummus, the store bought hummus in your typical supermarkets.   I would come here again and try a different dish out, rather than the Lula. The Kibbeh was good dipped into the Hummus!   Customer service was amazing!! Everyone was so friendly here and all of the team members had a smile on their faces!",

I ordered Shawarma beef plate with garlic sauce and it is seasoned to perfection. The Gyro plate is naturally flavorful. Both served with rice, hummus, & pita bread. I'm very particular with the meat, I've eaten where the meat was not tender or was cut the wrong way. We enjoyed the food a lot! Excellent flavor and consistency. This is a place where I can comeback over and over again & try everything on the menu!  The place is cozy with friendly staff.",

He was very nice, explained all the options that came with each meal (I had a lot of questions because I'm not familiar with middle eastern food/terms). Awesome customer service and food.  I ordered their beef kabob medium rare (meat was perfectly grilled seasoned, and juicy) with roasted jalapeno, roasted whole tomato and fresh hummus and soft pita bread. It came with their some rice which was delicious and fragrant. My friends ordered lamb, and beef shawarma with nicely seasoned fries. Our plates were empty at the end.   This place is one of my favorite Shawarma place, hands down. I would be recommending this place to my friends that live in Vegas and also on my collection list for eater in North Vegas.",

I ordered the gyro and while I was waiting I got to sample the cucumber juice, berry tea and Baba ganoush.   The pita bread here is perfect. I don't like super thick pita I like it like a thick tortilla and that is how theirs is. The meat has a wonderful flavor and the cucumber sauce is also perfect. I haven't tried every gyro in town but it's certainly the best I've had in a long time.   It is also very fat and full. Very filling all I needed to eat was just the gyro and they deliver! I will be having this again in the very near future.  Edit: 04/04  Went back today it was soo good. I have 1 suggestion or more of a request to the owner. Can you please carry this product in the picture because a bit of it on your Baba ghanouj in the center. Just a blob will make it soooo much better",

I ordered the non-spicy falafel plate with Armenian salad and my husband had the chicken kabob plate with hummus. Everything was delectable and came out warm. The plates came with a side of pita that quickly disappeared into my stomach. I caved in at the end and ordered baklava. It was the best I have ever had (I prefer mine to have a lot of honey.) The service was friendly and quick. The woman (Sorry I didn't remember her name! Boo me!) at the front explained they make everything homemade including the baklava and falafel.   This being all said...the front of their store was boarded up with plywood as someone a few months ago ran a car into the restaurant. They just reopened after being closed for a few months. They have all new chairs and tables. The dining environment isn't the prettiest but who cares when you are eating like a Queen!",

We ordered the beef shawarma plate, sultani plate and some extra hummus and baba ganoush.  It might've been just this order but the beef shawarma was so greasy that I had a problem eating it and the meat on the sultani plate was very dry and tough.  The lamb chops were very good, but the beef and chicken were so overcooked it was hard to eat.  Again, things were a little greasy for my liking.  As far as the hummus and baba ganoush, most recipes use some olive oil and I could tell that the oil on there was canola or vegetable.  I opted to not eat those and wasted a lot of money.  To their defense, the menu online does not say any kind of oil is used, so maybe I was seeing things.  We would try this again but maybe at better hours and just eat inside.  With a place so seemingly busy and popular, it's likely to have off days, especially if you order late at night like I did.",

We were accompanied by my service dog who is trained to perform medical alert due to my medical condition.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and never asked about her.  This meant a lot because while federal law says my dog is allowed to accompany me, not all places actually welcome us.  The falafel wrap was incredible -- the best I have ever had. I liked the Mediterranean seasonings on the fries, and they were much like what we have eaten in the Middle East.  My husband really enjoyed his beef shawarma wrap and fries.  The baklava was not as over-the-top sweet and honey coated as we have had at other restaurants, but it was absolutely delicious.  We tried an imported Armenian peach lemonade drink that was absolutely delicious.  The prices are very affordable.  Definitely check out this place!",

I ordered online through Yelp (love this feature!) and drove to pick it up. As soon as I entered, I was greeted by not only the woman at the register (sorry, I did not catch her name), but also the kitchen staff stopped to look up and welcome me in the door. They had such pride of ownership, I wonder if they are the owners? Anyway, the service here is great and everyone is so friendly!  My food was ready and the gentleman who handed it to me asked me if I would like to open everything up and inspect the order. I declined; everything was so neatly packed with care, so it seemed a safe bet that it was all there and the order was correct after I unpacked it when I got home. We had the shawarma sliders, vegetarian combo, and the chicken shawarma pita combo. Everything was delicious and fresh. We will definitely be back for more!",

It does seem like good Mediterranean food is hard to find in some parts of the valley and I was hoping this would be a solid adventure. Anyhow,  I purchased two of the beef shawarma wraps to go. I drove home approx. 5 minutes away,  spent another 5 minutes or so putting away groceries before I broke into the food.   As I held the wrap in my hand (still wrapped in foil) I noticed there was no sign of heat at all and that continued from the first to the last bite.  From the pita bread to the veggies,  sauce, and meat,  all cold.   The flavor was great,  the customer service was great,  but the food was cold. Maybe a bad day there or an off chance experience so I'll check it out again some time in the future and leave another review.",

Those of us who reside in this area know we are limited when it comes to ethnic restaurants, now we have a fast food alternative that is NOT a franchise, a burger, fried chicken or a taco place! I was recently in Montreal and went crazy over the shawarma restaurants as I walked the city, and wondered why we do not have them here, and voila, my prayers were answered, they just opened 10 days ago!  I ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate, it was served with rice, hummus, pita bread, pickled turnips and a drink for $8.99. The beef was flavorful and was topped with a creamy garlic sauce to die for. The rice was flavorful and the hummus, I ate on its own because it was creamy and well seasoned. I am so pleased to have a go to place that is close, and the prices are reasonable because food is ordered at the counter.  I noted the Whole Rotisserie Chicken with pita bread, garlic sauce and pickled turnips for $8.49, I know I will be stopping by for that deal! Today I am returning to sample the Spas Armenian Yogurt Soup that is made on Fridays, I will add an update afterwards.   This is a new restaurant on the corner of Jones and Craig. They are open  7 days a week 11-8 and they also deliver with a $20 minimum. The owner is from Armenia and is very passionate about his food. and I was made to feel welcomed.You know where I will be found!",

I also ordered a side of garlic sauce. I' not sure if that's what I actually got, it was unlike any other garlic sauce I've had.  Hummus was clearly very fresh, but fairly bland and only one pita for the generous sized portion.  Last but not least, the pickled vegetables. Salty wet cabbage.",

Always a good restaurant choice when thinking about places to eat in NLV. It's clean and the staff are friendly. Tip though, don't drink the Armenian coffee with dinner unless you're Armenian; I was up till 4 am maybe? They warned me and i didn't listen, bless their hearts.",

    "text": "So the order we put in, tztaki salad, with all three sides (we got one), with an over done falafel stick (you get one for 1.99 btw). Was a huge disappointment. A soupy \"salad\" of cream and cucumber what I received. Pretty far from a salad and very misleading for 7 dollars. When calling to tell them about it they not only wouldn't replace it (or even give me the missing sides) and said the salad was more of a dip and it was my fault somehow. In thier mercy they said I could order again and they'd wave the delivery charge. How this place has the rating it does is mind boggling.  Update: A manager named Angela called me a couple hours later to ask about customer service and food quality. Even though neither was very good, she talked to me for awhile to make sure she could do whatever she could to make things better and I have to commend her for coming down to my apartment to get the food because she wanted to show the owners. Also gave me a credit to another meal. I have to add 2 stars for that.  Newer update: Angela came personally to bring the food and it was amazing. It's hard to find a restaurant willing to make a customer this happy. Maybe it was just a bad night but they have done nothing more but be awesome about fixing the mistake and I will definitely order from them again.",

The staff was very welcoming and friendly. I noticed their Check-in deal (free drink) which I took advantage of.  At around noon, I was the only customer which was alright as I prefer a quiet restaurant. During next half hour two other customers came in.  I ordered the beef schwarma platter which came with pickled veggies and hummus/pita.  The plate looked really tasty, but was disappointed when I tasted the meat as it was kinda dry and didn't have much flavor.  I had to reach for the salt and pepper which is rare for me. The rice was good as was the hummus/pita.  I would consider coming back to sample the chicken, and hopefully, it would be more moist than the flavorless beef.",

The food is made fresh daily and made to order. The authenticity in the flavor and the love you can tell each time it's cooked. It's truly a pleasure to come here. Not just for the sake of the food, but the environment that my daughter truly loves and consumes great amounts of food. I love this place the tabouli is on another level and over all cooking is on par with establishments that charge double of what they are charging.

The lady called and said it doesn't come with fries would you just like to change that to a combo I said sure... She then said to call Uber and tell them, I have done that before and held for a long time I replied can you just add it to the price, she put me on hold came back to the phone said no I can only charge you full price $2.99 an order for fries THATS THE TRUE STORY AND I HIDE BEHIND NOTHING, DECEPTIVE TO SHOW SOMETHING WITH FRIES IN A PIC AND THEN CUSTOMER OFFERS TO PAY FOR COMBO AND YOUR SO GREEDY YOU WANT TO CHARGE FULL PRICE FOR AN ALA CARTE ORDER FRIES.... Get your story straight before you come on here trying to act like your flying to the rescue and a good manager or owner treating customers like this I WANT NO REFUND, TO PROVE YOU WRONG I KNOW NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE, I never wanted anything free from the beginning... I do know owners or managers that treat customers like you do usually don't stay in business forever... Have a wonderful day...  PS to anyone looking at this review just look how awful the owner talks to his customers that don't give him up reviews it tells you everything you need to know STEER CLEAR....",

The business is owned and operated by a husband and wife, who seem like genuine people and definitely take their food seriously.  This is some of the better Mediterranean food you will find in Vegas.",

We had the manti dumplings, beef shawarma plate, and whole rotisserie  chicken. Everything was delicious. The manti may look small, but pack a lot of flavor. They are little delicate pockets of ground beef, dressed with their homemade garlic sauce. The beef shawarma was seasoned beautifully and was tender. Even the accompanying rice was tasty. I would have preferred more seasonings on the rotisserie chicken, but the owner explained he lightly seasons it for children's palates. Makes sense.   The owner came and talked with us for a while. Very personable and kind man! He honestly wanted our feedback and really listened. From talking with him, we could tell he sincerely enjoys cooking and puts a lot of thought into his menu and dishes. We are so happy to have this place close to us. We will come back to try the Lula kebabs and chicken shawarma!  Btw...everything is homemade! Even the dough for the manti dumplings!",

I had the shawarma beef plate which came with rice, hummus, pita bread and a drink. It was very good though a bit on the dry side. My daughter said she had no complaints at all.

Will definitely return again and I recommend to anyone who enjoys Mediterranean food.",

There shawarma beef and garlic sauce is on point . The gyro meat and tzatziki sauce is very good . The staff are very nice and even let me try the beef . Over all the best I found for shawarmas in the valley. Shawarma House will be a new add to place to eat for my family.",

I'm SO glad I did!  It's a very small place but there's room for small parties to sit. You order at the counter and they bring your order out to you. Everyone working there was very nice and attentive. I ordered a beef shawarma plate and the platter I received was the perfect size. It came with a soft, warm pita and a generous helping of hummus. I got spicy tzatziki on top of my beef shawarma and mixed it in with the rice. The beef was seasoned perfectly and had just the right amount of moisture.  I'm glad I found this spot because I'm out in the area once a month, definitely a place I'll stop by again for lunch in the future.",

I highly recommend the sultani plate which will let you try most of the food on the menu. It includes chicken kabob, beef kabob, lamp chops, dolma, kibbeh and a grilled tomato and grilled jalapeno with some super soft pita bread on the side.  This meal cost $24 and I feel it is well worth it you definitely won't leave hungry    We also did the 3 dipping sauce sampler which included hummus, tzaziki and baba ganoush. I am usually not of fan of hummus but this place had the best hummus I've ever tried, the baba ganoush is an egg plant based dipping sauce with a great texture and flavor also was the first time I had tried it and I liked it as well.    My old lady did the beef lulu she said it was good and I'm pretty sure she liked it because she cleared the plate.  All in all great food great service definitely will be eating there again.  Thanks for the great experience people of the shawarma house!!!!!!!!!!",

I had the gyro beef wrap (spicy) my wife had the lamb gyro wrap and we shared the lamb chops kabob. One of the best lunches we've had in some time. It took us back to when we lived in Europe.  I would have given five stars however nothing has compared to the lamb and shawarmas I've eaten when I lived in Saudi Arabia. This being said, this place is definitely a five star state side and they deliver too. Thumbs up Shawarma House.",

This was actually the second time we ordered from there and although the food we got from the first time was alright (the small size being the issue), I gave them a second chance and was still disappointed. Mind you, I'm very easy to please but the confrontational tone taken by the girl on the other end of the phone really ticked me off and \"soured\" the food for me on this occasion.

    "text": "Finally some decent Mediterranean food around my neck of the woods!  Family owned, Shawarma House hits the spot!  We liked it enough that we went two nights in a row for dinner!  The first night we went with the namesake, their beef shawarma.  The combo with seasoned fries, pickled turnips & a can of soda is $7.99.  The beef or chicken shawarma by itself is $5.99.  Not a bad deal for a meal, pricing about the same for other Mediterranean joints in town.  Didn't take long for things to come out.  Upon first inspection their shawarma could use a bit more of a serving of meat in the pita.  It was on the sparse side, but thankfully the shawarma meat that was there was pretty flavorful and tender.  Spiced right, and with the included garlic sauce they make, the shawarma was most tasty.  Like their fries too with the seasonings used, I think it's probably the same stuff they use for their shawarma meat.  Picked turnips were nice & purple, but didn't do much for me since they lacked any sort of flavor or pickling.  The second night we opted for 2 of their whole rotisserie chicken meals for $8.49 each.  Good value, the rotisserie chicken meal comes with a fresh made chicken, rice, pitas, hummus, garlic sauce, and pickled turnips.  Granted the chickens are on the small side (meaning not Costco humongous chicken) but they were moist and very flavorful with their Mediterranean dry rub.  This chicken stuffed in a pita and topped with some garlic sauce made for some good eating!  Rotisserie chicken was good enough for us to order a few more for lunch at our house on Thanksgiving!  Yep, chicken before the big turkey night event!  And our family really liked their chicken a lot.  They all agreed that garlic sauce adds a big flavor boost.  Could slather the stuff on a boot!  Will be visiting Shawarma House on the regular when I really need that pita fix.  Just gotta be sure to bring some Yelp breath mints!  Spicy!",

The restaurant was very accommodating even 15 minutes until their closing time. They made my order for me and it was sooooo delicious. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with taziki on the side since I was sharing with my three year old. The portion size was just right. He loved it, I loved it and we will definitely be back for more. Excellent service and excellent food go a long way these days and they definitely nailed it.  Editing to update.  I ordered again with Shawarma House last night and we had issues with GrubHub...again. I asked for taziki on the side and it was put on top of my food. I tried calling GrubHub but couldn't reach anyone so I called the restaurant. They helped me at first saying it was a kitchen oversight. Then about 25 minutes later I got a call from the owner saying that they won't be accommodating me since my order didn't specify \"on the side\" and that the person I spoke with was \"new and didn't understand how to read the order sheet.\" They advised me that I would need to go to GrubHub for my return and she also felt the need to mention that she has already called GrubHub to explain what happened as if I'm not being truthful about what I asked for. I'm upset because the retraction could have simply been an explanation on how refunds work when ordering with a third party company rather than telling me that I'm not being truthful about what I asked for on my order.   Long story short, the pictures from my order receipt are attached and a picture of my food is as well...... Taziki sauce is cold which led to cold chicken and it is hard to reheat chicken smothered in taziki sauce.  Call the restaurant directly if you want to order from here, although, I'm not sure how far they deliver which is why I used GrubHub. Anyway, there may be a disconnect between them and GrubHub. Save yourself the disappointment.",

    "text": "I ordered delivery via Yelp and with them being 8 minutes away, my delivery was free, which was a huge plus!  I ordered the beef shawarma fries, hummus, baklava, a soda, and two orders of pita (partly because I needed to meet my $20 minimum, which was hard because of the low prices, and the other part because I read reviews about people not having enough pita for their hummus) - the food got here very quickly (especially for having ordered on a Saturday afternoon) and everything was still warm.  I will say this - Market Grille Cafe kinda spoiled me a bit with their amazing spanakopita & the best rice I've ever had, so my standards are a little high for Mediterranean. Although this place doesn't have spanakopita (my fave) the Beef Shawarma does not disappoint. I was also overwhelmed by the amount of pita that I ended up getting. It was nice to see they weren't stingy with the pita as some reviews suggested.  The beef was well-seasoned (and I'm Creole so I have a low sensitivity to seasoning lol) the fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; in other words, perfect. I asked for the garlic sauce to be put on the side, which I appreciated them heeding to. The sauce more or less is like garlic ranch dressing with the consistency, but still very good. The hummus was a little bland, but I picked up a tip from another yelper and added the garlic sauce to it and mixed it well - the hummus became 5 stars.  I was very happy to see that the soda was canned, which I prefer (I'm not a big fan of watered-down fountain drinks). The baklava is actually the reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 - it was soggy on the bottom and the pastry was more on the soft side & not crispy how I like it, but overall the flavor was still satisfying.  Also, the young lady who delivered my food was very kind and sweet. She had no problems following my delivery instructions to find my apartment, and her genuine kindness made the whole delivery experience that much better.  I'm one of those people who's always skeptical about trying new places out of fear of disappointment and wasted money, but I'm so glad I took a chance! You guys have a loyal customer out of me! :)",

Their is nothing like fresh homemade style food  Thank you for the amazing food and for your generous hospitality. Can't wait for next time.",

    "text": "Saw this business through yelp, then an hour later I popped-in! Eager much? Well, I figure since I was heading to see the lover for lunch...might as well, aye. I entered with babies in tow then was immediately greeted. Loved that! Especially since there were no other customer in the restaurant. No excuses. Belieeeeeve me there have been time I had entered a business with tumbleweeds rolling by and no one says a thing, looks at you look as if you just brought max occupancy.  The young lady working the front then handed me their menu, but I already knew what I was going to be getting. I ordered the #1 which is a chicken shawarma wrap, Mediterranean fries, and a can of soda. My french fry addict ordered, plain french fries! I mean, what else are you supposed to order at a Mediterranean restaurant, people! You come for the French fries! Lol. So I was happy that they sold plain french fries for the nagging minion.   The side of fries cost $2.99. Serving was perfect. My #1 was 7.99 and again...the serving to me was perfect. The meat was not dry at all. I ordered to-go then had to wait for the lover to come out, which by then my beard grew and my food softened up abit. In fairness, I can't say how fresh the vegetables were or how perfectly fried the fries were because of that. None-the-less, I inhaled it! It was so good. I think if I ate it fresh it would've been even better!   Bought the husband a baklava...he enjoyed it because it wasn't too sweet unlike other baklavas he has tried. I have a nut allergy, so I couldn't tell you if it was deelish or not. I spent a total of 15 bucks and a dime. Not bad.  Glad there is a Mediterranean joint nearby whenever I'm feeling shawarma-ish. Next time I think I'll try the plates instead of the wrap, then I can assess the situation properly. All-in-all...it was pretty good. Gets my recommendation until further notice. I'll definitely be back with the whole gang.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

Just some small changes to make the  customers experience a little more pleasant, like a screen TV menu and a most welcomed HAPPY HOUR menu from 2-4 pm Mon thru Fri.  You even have the option of having these tasty dishes delivered to you for FREE if you're lucky to live within their 5 mile radius.  The only improvements I would recommend are to offer drinks that are popular in the Mediterranean region and to expand their dessert menu.",

I really enjoyed the hummus and the pita bread as well. My partner got the chicken lula plate, he thought it was ok, nothing special. I also got a side of the Mantee and that was easily my favorite thing! I would order those as my entree. My partner wasn't super into it, but I loved it!

Also paid $7.99 for the chicken kabobs with Armenian salad, grilled tomato, rice, pita and a can of soda.The beef lula & chicken kabobs were cooked perfectly and tasted very good.  Armenian salad was good but could have used a little more dressing.  The rice, pita and soda well were rice, pita and soda.  I also had the Mediterranean fries which were cooked prefect and tasted great.  I tried both the garlic sauce & the Tzatziki both tasted really good.  Overall it was a good amount of food and should be enough to fill most people up.  The dining area was kind of small but it was really clean.  All the employees were very friendly and nice plus they answered all my questions since it was my first time there.  The AC wasn't working but hey things happen.  Of course I picked the hottest day of the year to go there.   The only negative about my experience there was that I had to pay for a side of the garlic sauce.  That is not a big negative as I said above the sauce tasted real good but just wished it came with my order.  I will be back for sure since it is near my work.  Plus the food tasted great and the employees were all so nice.  Even at the regular prices for each plate above @ $10.99 it is still well worth it.",

My girlfriend's plate came with a choice is salad. We were debating between the tzatziki salad or the Armenian salad and we asked the cashier for her opinion. She ended up getting the tzatziki salad, but shortly after we got our meal, the waitress brought out a complimentary plate of the Armenian salad so we can try both. Awesome service!   We'll definitely be back. I think this is my new go-to for my shawarma fixings.",

I had the chicken shawarma wrap combo, an order of hummus and a small side of tzatziki.   The shawarma was delightful!   So flavorful and delish.  So glad I got the tzatziki though...it was super amazing with that spread on top.    Hummus was fab!   The pita that came with it was a little dry though.  But the hummus was outstanding.   The tzatziki was super fresh and perfect with the shawarma.   I was a little bit confused by the sizing, however.   It came in a pretty big portion (I got the half order), and was easily twice the size of the hummus portion.  I would have preferred the sizing to be opposite (bigger hummus, smaller tzatziki).   But in any case it was outstanding! If I have any gripes (aside from the sort of dry pita...), it would be that they're only open until 8!    You've gotta check this place out!",

Thank goodness my check in with Yelp got me a free drink because I needed something to choke down the dry, mushy, unflavored chicken shawarma pita I ordered.  My friends also hated their food.  I pretty much knew the chicken shawarma plate my friend ordered would suck since my pita did but my other friend ordered the falafel and beef pita.  The falafel was so much to his disliking that he didn't even bother eating the pita.  So in all fairness that might have actually been good.    However, it was a sad, sad day for my appetite and taste buds.  I'm normally not this harsh but upon reviewing my Wells Fargo bank statement the $19 spent there just reminded me of how annoyed I was that this was food was ugh!  Y'all were actually encouraging us to go on Yelp like you were just waiting to hear something good LOL!  If we would have eaten there I would have been honest with you but since we took it home here is the review you wanted.  I wouldn't suggest anything other than getting a better cook.....maybe someone who's actually middle eastern and not Black.  I'm not hatin because hell, I'm Black but it didn't even taste like Black folks cooking middle eastern style it just tasted um like gross!  I'm in tears writing this because I cannot believe that you guys had at least 4 stars.  I mean who ARE these people, former prison inmates??!!!  That is all.  I won't be back.  Thank goodness for Pita Kitchen, Pita Bistro and Pita Jungle in Phoenix!",

Mine was AMAZING!  It was as good as anything I have eaten in the middle east, and everyone else was very pleased with their meal.  The female owner came out to talk to us and was very kind.  The next time we are in Vegas I will search this place out.  Their food was amazing, and it's nice to see people who truly care about their customers.  Definitely go here to eat!",
