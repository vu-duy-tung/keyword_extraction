The white mocha was great along with the Oreo frappachino.  I also got the croissant which was very good. It's located on the corner with a large covered patio which is nice to sit out on. Prices were comparable to Starbucks, but drink quality is better.",

I even saw the guy buy a meal before approaching the owner for the sale. If this is how he treats his customers I will never eat here again and I will surely tell everyone I know about the unprofessional attitude this guy treats his customers with. The worst part was when the customer handed him a card and the manager actually put the card back in the sales guy's shirt pocket! Where I'm from people don't touch or treat one another that way.

The decor...music...even the athmosphere in general made me forgot I was in Vegas for a sec.  Prices here are great...cheaper than Starbucks and that overrated Sambalatte just a couple blocks down at Boca Park. At first I was gonna go for my usual Iced hazlenut latte but the Cappuccino Carmello caught my attention. The barista said it can be compared to a caramel macchiato. I was like hey, perfect! That sold me in an instant. My boyfriend got his usual ice blended mocha frap sort of drink. Both medium sized beverages cost me $9.19 with tax.   My coffee tasted good, strong coffee taste but not to the point where it's bitter, but....I don't know... =/ it won't be a place I would go out of my way for.",

All the staff are amazingly friendly and helpful.  They always come check on you and to see if you any anything or if you need refills.  BTW, coffee and teas are always free refills here :)  A nice place for group gathering with the variety of selections and also great for solo eater just wants to be left alone, enjoy food and/or play on computer.  I usually meet friends here for breakfast/brunch because I know everyone will have a great time.  You order your food at the counter, you put the number they give you on your table, and your food gets delivered :)  I always think it incredible that they hunt down the entire outdoor and indoor seating to find your number, especially during the weekends when there are loads of people.  Tivoli Village is pretty empty in general, which is quite unfortunate, but Leone Cafe is always full of people having a good time either enjoying a full meal or just snacks/drinks.    I'm usually here for breakfast, so can't comment on other food besides breakfast. But I love their breakfast croissant sandwich, crepes and wraps.  And they're always happy to customize it for your needs, usually without any extra charges.    It's hard to find 100% friendly service restaurants/cafes nowadays, usually a hit and miss, but I have to say with the hundreds of times I've been to Leone, I've never been disappointed at either the food or the service.  It's a great casual spot to hang out.  The only negative note I have for the place is flies.  They're usually some flies around the outdoor seating area, a little annoying, but doesn't stop me from coming that's for sure ;)",

Their tiramisu seems to be their own recipe that isn't as traditional as other tiramisu's, but it was still good.  I've had their latte and other drinks, but unfortunately not very impressive. This cafe seems to be good for a quick something, but it's not a place I'd actually hang out. The atmosphere is nice, but kinda sterile and indifferent and tables too small to play games on. It's still a nice place, but not a favorite.",

I know my parents in-law come here because they enjoy his service and friendliness!  Food: delicious!! Here's what I've tried: -chicken avocado wrap: they don't skimp on avocado!! The chicken was well marinated and grilled to perfection! The wrap was grilled and this warm.  -Banana Nutella crepe: delicious as it sounds! The crepe batter was chewy and warm. I have no complaints.  -Chinese chicken salad: the dressing was amazing!! Not sure what's in the dressing but get it! Just try it! Yum! -pecan tart: a little too sweet for my taste but goes well coffee.  -Chocolate dome (on the house from Leone!): anything on the house tastes better, right? =P jk. This chocolate dome was very Rich and smooth. It just melts in your mouth as it hits your tongue. I was satisfied with one (okay, maybe two or a few) bites.  -Lattes: my soy latte with vanilla syrup was good but too sweet. I made the mistake of adding vanilla syrup so skip that if you prefer a more subtle sweetness.  Overall: a nice and beautiful cafe with great food! Staff was also very friendly and helpful. Thumbs up!",

The food is delicious! You can taste the quality. Been here a couple of times and tried different menu items and everything I got so far has been tasty. The best thing I've tried there so far is the panini breakfast muffin. You'll be back for that alone. Rest assured though that whatever you order you will be happy with it. Great place and reasonably priced.",

Then we came back for dessert at 9:50pm and the the staff was cleaning and more concerned with getting out of there than taking care of us and informed us they would be making our coffee and dessert to go.  Don't worry we won't come back so clean away.  If this is the way you run your place then you won't have to clean cause you won't have customers.

The cashier was respectful, the servers and bussers were quick on their feet and the manager (Vivian) checked up on me every so often. (Customer Service: 10/10)  You order and sit down with a number where they bring the food and drinks to you. The tables are nicely spaced and you definitely do not feel cramped. There's also more tables outside but in this heat, I recommend in door dining. This is a nice cafe to do homework/business work because it's not a loud setting.  (Setting: 9/10)   I ordered the Salmon Ala Vodka Pasta and was surprised at how big the filet of salmon was. A drop or two of lemon was all that was needed to top off the perfectly cooked salmon. The pasta did not taste bland and with a little bit of black pepper, was perfect for my taste. There should have been a bit more sauce on the pasta but that's the only niche I found within this dish. (Food: 9/10)  Overall, this is a great cafe that is definitely worth a trip. The workers are kind, food is great, and I'll definitely be back for many more.",

Their display is on the small side while prices are on the high end. We can blame their Tivoli location for that. Everything here seems to have a sizeable mark-up compared to other off-Strip spots.  The tiramisu ($5.75) was not good. It was almost all cream with very few lady fingers and lacking the liquor or espresso flavor that it should have. The cralin ($5.75) was much better fortunately. Chocolatey, crunchy, sweet, but not overwhelming, it was a huge step up from our first dessert, but still not on the same level as desserts found in the top tier bakeries on the west side.",

    "text": "I love me some coffee shops, and this one happened to be in my line of vision when my bf and I were exploring Tivoli Village. I veered in and thought I'd try their lattes, but their hot-chocolate-with-a-shot-of-espresso snagged me instead. I had just stuffed myself with a burger at another restaurant.. but I when I saw the dispay case full of beautiful goodies I *had* to get a bite of something sweet too. Honestly, I felt like a country hick in this pretty place, so I said, \"I'll have that thing with the almonds and the strawberry on top,\" so I could get the hell out of the way.   The total for my small drink and dessert surprised me: over $12 before a tip! Instead of yelling about highway robbery, I just paid it and hoped my bf didn't hear that I'd just dropped that much on food when I wasn't even the slightest bit hungry. But the guy hands me my cake slab in a tiny To GO box, and it had smooshed the top of my cake! You can smoosh a $4 cake, but this is an $8 cake, and I refuse to eat it smooshed! The guy immediately gave me a new one, in a bigger box, in pristine condition. Bonus points for fixing that without rolling his eyes at me!   My boyfriend raised the very good questions, \"How is a slice of cake $8??\" and more importantly, \"How can you even be hungry after that lunch you ate?!\" Well, I wasn't hungry, and I didn't know it was going to be expensive, but since I had it I was at least going to make a valiant effort to see what The Eight Dollar Cake tastes like. Just take a bite or two and toss the rest, right?   WRONG.  Leone Cafe has the best damned cake I've ever tasted.  It was a strawberry shortcake type deal, with almond slivers coating the outside, and a fine layer of dark chocolate on the bottom. The strawberries were not too tart, the cream was not too sweet, the light fluffy cake layers were somehow not soggy, the almonds were toasted exactly right, and the ultra-thing layer of dark chocolate on bottom was just delicate enough to add a hint of flavor without overpowering the whole thing.   I ate all of it. The entire time I was telling my bf, \"Mmmph! Mmmm, mmbbbllgg!\" (Translation: \"Holy crap, this cake is delicious! You gotta try it! I don't care if you're full! Try a bite! Not this one, this one's my bite.\") Seriously, this cake was PERFECTION! If I had to do it over, I'd just skip the burger place for lunch and go straight to the $8 cake slice. And what you should do right now is stop reading this and go get one too. You're welcome.",

The food is good & reasonably priced- especially when compared to Starbucks. The staff is always super friendly & helpful. I have NEVER had a rude encounter here, and I come here at least once a week for the last year.  The manager (owner?) is very friendly an helpful as well. Staff makes the rounds to see if water, coffee/tea refills are needed. They've cleaned up after my toddler numerous times, telling me not to lift a finger- even after she broke a salt shaker this morning. I love it here & prefer to come here over other coffee shops because its convenient to meet up with friends, there is a playground near by for children & I can always find a seat and am served quickly (and with a smile). The only exception to the quick service is on Saturdays during the farmers market (obviously).  I didn't give 5 stars because I am hoping for some healthy food/snack options soon? GF pastries? Fruit (that isn't atop a tart) perhaps? Other than, it's perfect and I will continue to support this cafe!",

    "text": "It was love at first sip. I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I love good coffee, and I love that coffee more when it is artfully brewed. I'm a purist. I prefer black coffee or espresso. And I tend to think of flavors and cream as  something to mask mediocrity. But I digress. So I ordered the espresso and the husband ordered coffee. Delicious. Plus, we received sparkling water, as is common practice in foreign countries where they celebrate it's play against the coffee on the palate. Perfect. There was also free water available, flavored beautifully with cucumber.  I'm already happy. And then the food. We ordered a sandwich and a quiche. The sandwich was well prepared and incredibly tasty. And then there was the quiche. I'm generally not a huge fan of them. Can't really say I've ever met one that I enjoyed. But the husband is a big fan. Upon trying a bite, I understood his love of them. The crispy flaky crust, the tender, melt-in-your mouth fluffiness of egg. Oh goodness, this is what it's supposed to taste like. It was amazing. The husband said a True quiche should have some parsley in it, but I was more concerned with the deliciousness than authenticity.  Both the food and coffee can only be described as made with love here. I'm sure I'll be back repeatedly until I've sampled a majority of those delicious-looking desserts that beckoned my name when ordering. Mmmmm.",

The best part is you can bring your dog! It's perfect for Sunday morning brunch or a late night read. Only con is they do close at 9 PM. For you breakfast lovers breakfast is served all day! I couldn't be happier with that. Also I love how the tea comes in a huge French press pot with hot water. No teabags it's actually a real leaf tea. Believe it or not that's hard to find these days!",

Maybe having some common sense that is common among most people would be great as a skill on the employees resume. Highly disappointed with this lack of sense on this one.

The scenery is beautiful in the morning and grabbing a light or heavy breakfast/lunch here is exquisite. We've been here for awhile so it's only right to leave an amazing review! They have a pretty good range of drinks, bake goods, and food options. The prices are also reasonable as well.   The cafe itself gives you a France atmosphere with beautiful scenery of Tivoili Village and it's quite relaxing to watch people walk by. They also allow pets to dine outside as well! There's seatings available inside as well as outside patio. It's a bit different then most cafe because you first wait in line and order then pay for your food then sit down and wait for it with a number. I find it when i come here to be very elegant and fancy with i guess you can say an older mature group of people dining and not many teenagers. It's a great spot for a casual date, meetings, or even studying! (There's free wifi!!)  The staffs here are friendly as well the only complaint i have is that sometimes there's a bunch of dirty tables so finding a spot can be rough sometimes. I love how attentive the staffs were, they checked up on us multiple times and also the owner is a lovely man! I always see him in the morning/afternoon and he's always happy and asking us how we are doing! Everyone is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick too.   Everything here is so yummy! I've been trying a new dish every time i come here and it never disappoints! I'm really looking forward to trying their juices here next time as well and slowly but surely try all their dishes on the menu!  Favorites:   Fruit waffles: Blueberry waffles with fresh fruits and nutella. The waffles are pretty big and this is a really filling dish, you'll love this if you like sweets for breakfast!  Champagne chicken berries salad: (MY FAVE) berries, walnuts, greens, blue cheese and chicken. The cheese really brings the entire dish together. All the flavors of the salad complimented each other and it's a bite of heaven every time. Also light but super filling!  Open face breakfast bagel: Cream cheese, eggs, turkey bacon, pico de gallo, spinach, cheese.. etc. This dish is fully loaded and all on top of a toasted bagel!   Breakfast croissant: tomato, egg, bacon, cheese, and avocado all stuffed in a warm crispy croissant.",

For myself I ordered their breakfast sandwich called the Leone Breakfast Corrasion with a side of fruit and also a Carmel iced coffee with soy milk: The prices are incredible (I live in LA).   When I got home I laid everything out and gave the girls their orders (I don't remember what they all had so I apologize for not being able to recommend other options). My sandwich was amazing! I could have eaten another (it's not a small sandwich it was just so delicious). I didn't eat my fruit because the first bite I went to have had mold on it. This was disturbing since it was a restaurant and they should be making everything fresh daily. I just threw it out and didn't bother to call since we wouldn't have had time to go pick up a replacement. But my ice coffee was so delicious. I didn't need to add any sugar because of the Carmel flavoring; I regretted not ordering a large!   Overall I enjoyed this cafe, the atmosphere from what I experienced when I walked in was like an European cafe: busy, lots of light, quaint little tables.",

One time I ordered my cheesecake with the rest of my meal and they brought it out before the entree, which was weird. Another time I asked for the soup to be brought out as an appetizer and they delivered our entrees 30 seconds after the soup lol.

Seeing as it was my first time and I was meeting someone, this was a pleasant surprise   The outside seating was not only beautiful but had a generous mist cooling it down and felt spacious. I didn't sit outside because I was looking for an outlet for my laptop. The inside was spacious as well and equally gorgeous. I have never been to a cafe in Europe, but this felt very much like what I imagine them to be like. The lighting is bright, the colors are sophisticated, and even though the manager that day apologized for the A/C not working properly (it was getting fixed that day) it was still a suprisingly comfortable temperature.   I got a plain cappuccino which was amazing. I also ordered some sort of open bagel sandwich which was equally good, but i wasn't able to finish it because it was so filling. It came with hash browns which made it feel like a real meal, not just cafe food. It was also served on a glass plate with silverware. I don't know why but I was pleasantly surprised again by this discovery. This is not your typical coffee shop and I will certainly be back to try more.",

The cozy wicker seats and dramatic chandeliers reminded me of the many Italian and French themed restaurants located on the Strip. They have a large covered patio with a lot of seating and I especially admired the large antique inspired chandelier on the patio, it was a gorgeous touch.   We decided to go with the Iced vanilla latte. It was rather milky, not too much vanilla flavor, not overly sweet, and not too strong in coffee flavor - yet we enjoyed it. It was addicting and a perfect after dinner 'dessert' coffee.  I wouldn't necessarily make my way over here for my morning caffeine (kick in the ass) on a work week - but for a lighter type of dessert coffee, this is the place.",

The patio is perfect for a nice relaxing lunch with the view of beautiful Tivoli Village.   I always get the same thing cause I'm addicted to it, garden omelet with egg whites, no cheese and a salad. It has veggies and pesto sauce!   I get Stryder the grilled cheese sandwich with chicken and chips and he loves it as well and you can't for get his macaroon he has to have each time he comes!   I've also had their hot tea and coffee and they both come in a French press as well as a couple of their specialty drinks and have never been disappointed!  Their manager is awesome, short guy with an accent, if they ever make an order wrong he always makes it better with a croissant! :)   Highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It is casual but still feels higher-end cause of the location and how they take care of you, great attention to detail!",

Since Tivoli remodeled and removed the playground we had less incentive to dine and shop there.  Unfortunately for the local restaurants, that decision was a bad move.   None the less, Leone Cafe has terrific breakfast, brunch and lunch items.  Even when the weather is hot, they have misting fans at the patio to cool you down.  Pastry is excellent.",

You actually feel like you're not in the desert which, being a local, is nice.  You walk up to the counter and place your order and if you're deciding to eat in, they give you a number which you place on your table so they can deliver your order to your table.  The pastry counter is filled with goodies and on my first visit today, I decided to indulge in the Nutella Cappuccino (a must-have) and the Goat Cheese, Asparagus Quiche. The quiche came with your choice of salad or fruit.  I honestly didn't care too much for the quiche but the fruit was fresh and the coffee, definitely on point.   A great casual breakfast, brunch or lunch place that has outdoor seating and is dog friendly.",

The whole \"village\" feel of the complex is pretty fun to walk around in. There's also a little farmers market outside on Saturday mornings. Overall, a really awesome meal/experience/location.

This place is everything!  It is located in one of my favorite places, (Trivoli Village) if you've never been to this area its a must. It almost feels like you've stepped out of Las Vegas and traveled to a far off little city in Itay. Lights strung up guiding you up the cobblestone paved streets lined with quaint shops and eateries. You would lose track of time if it wasn't for the beautiful bell that rings for the hours.  In this little City within a city lies Leone Cafe. Perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast to start the day.  Leone Latte Especiale- 5/5 A beautiful combination of rich coffee and delicate sweet honey. Definitely recommend.  Quiche- 5/5 Flakey golden crust, surrounding a fluffy flavorful quiche.  Sit outside on a Sunday morning. You will not regret it",

It is in a wonderfully situated corner in Tivoli, a charming faux village in Summerlin, right off the Summerlin Parkway and Rampart.  The cafe reminds you of a French bistro or cafe along the Seine.  The busyness is comforting, but not the disorganization, which is plied by the staff. The rudeness of the staff is very French, too! The pastries are nondescript, and the coffee is fine, but nothing to write home about. It would be nice if they had some fine and unusual products like Orangina. I think they might sometimes...then again, maybe not. It's hard to get a straight answer from the bored, contemptuous skinny minis at the cashier.  But it's okay for a morning coffee when you come to the Farmer's Market on a Saturday. Except for the \"see and be seen\" nature of the place, and the fact that you feel swank when you sit outside on the patio, it would not be worth coming. Oh, and it's pricey, too.

The espresso had excellent flavor, and it was strong - like I said. The scone was perfect to sample - took it to go, which was nice. However, next time I would definitely try it on the premises. I would love some jam or clotted cream or SOMETHING to help push me into that luxurious English Tea vibe. *I have no idea if they even serve those sorts of accompaniment, but a guy can dream, right?  Service was friendly and efficient. The menu looks well-worth checking out for lunch or other treats. The classical cafe ala Italiano interior is a smart match with the greater Tivoli Village environs. Cute, fun, delicious.",

Their chicken caprese sandwich, chai and strawberry dessert are amazing! It seems as if they would be overpriced but the prices are reasonable considering the type of food they're serving ($9 for the chicken sandwich for instance).  They're not getting five stars because: their service is slow -- you wait a while for water refills, there are no fountain drinks (you're paying for a 20 oz bottle), and their seats are crammed next to each other inside. Oh, and people bring their pets so if you're allergic to dogs...well, now you know!!",

Then get the egg salad sandwich for take out and tell me how it is!",

The service was nice. They had several homemade bakery type desserts showcased inside. We tried the eclair and fruit custard. Very tasty!! Highly recommend:)",

There is indoor and outdoor seating. the staff is not only friendly but helpful. Very polite. Portions are decent and they will not leave you feeling hungry.   Due to Vegas temps, if dining outdoors any beverage with ice will quickly melt please keep that in mind.   Menu is large enough to give you options yet small enough not to overwhelm and theres a good amount of detail about each item.   Desserts are delicious and you'll want more than one. I won't have or take one of those to go said no one ever!   This was somewhat hipster, somewhat trendy, somewhat casual, its hard to put a definite label on it other than it was a good first experience and a good first impression.   If you're looking for something other than the strip, this is a nice change of pace and very relaxing. It affords the opportunity to have good food and good conversation.",

The coffee is phenomenal and the food is just as amazing. It's got a great ambience with indoor and outdoor seating. All the servers are extremely friendly and polite and most importantly helpful. I believe he is the manager, but the gentleman that was well dressed was walking around making sure everyone was happy and enjoying their food. Helping to accommodate everyone. I mean just an overall very pleasant individual. And to make it even better, one out buddies in the group may or may not have had a couple to many mimosas  but the man brought him out bread and cake to help with the carb loading (lol) to sober him up. I'm already planning another brunch get together there but before that I will be going back just for coffee in nothing more.",

How you order is annoying you walk up to a register and give them your order they give you a number and then you seat your self. Tacky to me but this seems to be the trend in the west coast. The food comes out looks amazing presentation is on key . I order the avocado toast damn they can't get this right it's so easy I don't understand the over kill! It tasted like shit. My egg over easy was cold and the white was still slimy they packed on alfalfa sprouts, shaved turnips and side salad  Was wilted with no dressing. Didn't even eat half. My husband had the omelet with no mushroom, hash browns and toast. He said the omelette had no flavor and was like cardboard same with the hash browns the toast was cold and hard as a rock. Needless to say we will pass on having breakfast here again. Maybe it's good for coffee,lattes,caps maybe a pastry. Not sure.",

When we got our salads we realized that they gave us the wrong salads completely. They gave us the kale salads. I hate kale. My friend didn't get her salmon at all. We didn't complain because they were swamped and we were hungry. I won't be back. I really don't see why everyone speaks so highly of this place.",

    "text": "I finally get the chance to write a review about this place! I have been so busy and it can be hard to upkeep with reviews of places that I've been to. But I keep them coming for all of you!  This cafe is located right in the heart of Tivoli Village and it is actually one of the highlights of this place. The spacing, design, and decor are all great. I would recommend sitting in the patio area that surrounds the outside of the cafe. It offers that charming cafe dining experience. :]  The food wasn't too bad, but there's really nothing fab about it. Nothing struck out to me and there really wasn't anything on the menu that will make me want to keep coming back here (See photos). I did, however, enjoy the chocolate mousse cake. It was light and not overly sweet. But I really only came here for the ambience, sights, and the opportunity to walk the dog in a somewhat shnazzy place that's not a park. lol  Customer service was okay. The one behind the counter didn't seem too friendly and looked slightly irritated. We got here about an hour before closing so I don't know why anyone working would be that annoyed. I know that at the end of the work day you count down the minutes, but when running a business, don't let your customers sense it.  I'm one to support local businesses in hopes that it will still thrive because of the likings of the location. Tivoli Village still has a lot of potential when it comes to opening shops and restaurants. The location is great and it can still expand. Leone Cafe adds to that, and it serves as a great option for a quick bite. Give it a try when in the area!",

The food is delicious, the coffee is excellent, and the setting is very nice. In cooler weather we sit outside and it is very relaxing. Their omelets are delicious but HUGE-I think they use 6 eggs. I am a big guy and a big eater and we always split the omelet and I'm still stuffed. The bread that comes on the side is hot, doughy, and delicious with the side toppings. Their Mediterranean Omelet is my absolute favorite. Their pastries are also to die for, the \"Charlot\" I believe is my favorite.

The chai lattes are DIVINE and my boyfriends chocolate milk was better than any other ol' choco milk he'd ever consumed. The food was also impeccable! I had a croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, avocado, bacon and cheese and let me tell you I ate it all up! Every last crumb! And! Despite finding ourselves needing several things throughout our meal, (extra napkins, ketchup, to-go boxes, etc.) all of the servers and staff members were extremely ready and willing and happy to help us out - which is sometimes hard to come by! So glad we found ourselves sucked into this small cafe because we enjoyed our breakfast so much and although it got really busy and the line was out the door, we still felt as if we were sharing a cozy little meal together and it didn't bother us in the slightest. I've come to believe that lines out the door can only mean one thing... MUST TRY! Please, do the same!",

First of all it was cold outside and freezing inside. The outdoor heaters were not on. I was waiting to order and no one came over. A girl that worked somewhere in Tivoli walked in and they ran right over. Of course they had to chat and I had to wait. But I am not in a hurry, so I stayed patient. I ordered a Breve. It tasted good, but was only lukewarm. My teeth were chattering so I drank it fast to leave. The server made some smart comment about my fast consumption of beverage. Ah, tomorrow Sambalatte. And everyone wonders why they don't make it?",

Mainly because my Dad's wife is a difficult customer and they handle all her 'little' requests with a smile and go above and beyond. Aside from the friendly staff and great manager (owner?) who is always touching the tables, the food is just really good. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to your table. Prices are very reasonable for the portions and there is a large patio which is always busy in the warmer months. Oh and did I mention that it's also super kid friendly.  I'm a huge fan of their salads, especially the Champagne Chicken Berry Salad and the Chinese Chicken Salad. They are huge and filled with tones of fresh fruit and sliced marinated grilled chicken. They come with 3 slices of toasted baguette too! So yummy.  The coffees and teas and outstanding and I find their lattes to be far superior to Starbucks, especially the Chai Tea Latte. Yum! And the latte art is on point as well.",

My personal favorite is their salmon Caesar wrap. (Yes, salmon!!) Their sweets are also to die for-- my new favorite is their orange mousse cake. Think orange creamsicle in cake form.  Drinks: By far thee best latte I've ever had. I used to get my lattes at Starbucks but they always make it so milky that I can hardly taste the espresso so I always resorted to an Americano. In Leone, however, their lattes have the perfect amount of milk that it doesn't drown out the espresso at all. Also, they have a wide variety of hot & cold drinks, including a Nutella cappuccino.  Ambiance: Great indoor and outdoor seating areas that are very ideal for breakfast/brunch dates, studying, meetings, etc.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",

The cafe Lattes are served in big mugs and they put froth hearts on top. I really enjoyed mine.",

Salads are always fresh and the dressings are not over powering. My favorite wrap is the chicken guacamole. Their sweet desserts are seriously amazing. I always want one more. I love their coffee. I totally prefer coming here then the typical Starbucks. Only downside its always busy, so the inside the tables and chairs can crowded. Outside seating is available though!",

I see what they're going for here, European, but it's really \"European\", nothing special. Pretty much a place for basic Americans to think it's \"fancy\". Coffee (black) was weak, see-through, and tasted like water. Mediterranean omelette was cold, hash browns were all crunchy, and the \"fresh\" orange juice was probably two oranges and the rest WATER. Most likely wont be back.",

Both cheesecakes were delicious :) I ordered a vanilla latte and that was great as well.  One of my friend's coffee a few sips in realized there was a hair in his cup (gross, but it's a human error, so no big deal just ask for a new cup of coffee). We asked to get it replaced and twenty minutes later we still had no new coffee... I think they forgot about it. So we went back up and it came out immediately.   I then ordered a pot of jasmine tea and that was perfect and easily shared with five people. Bonus points because they will refill with more hot water if asked!   My experience with this cafe was overall very good :) Will definitely visit again sometime soon.",

The menu is kinda pricey but they are generous enough with the food and refills it's not too bad. Sitting out on their patio I the way to go. It's generally packed so getting their early may be the best bet. When the weather is nice, there's really no better brunch restaurant when it comes in atmosphere! Customer service is always solid as well.   I've recommended this place to many friend and family over the years and I'll continue to do so.",

Service is amazing and the boys are always kind and make tasty cafes as hell. They also have a misting system on the patio so you never feel too hot even on incredibly hot days. You totally get loose of track of time because you are just satisfied with the Italian village style around you while drinking coffee, eating dessert and talking to friends.",

The place is charming, and has plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. We went to the counter to order, and picked up a steak sandwich, a pasta dish, an eclair, and a chocolate cake.  My friends pasta came out pretty quick, as did the desserts. My steak sandwich took probably 20 minutes, and that is being conservative. My friend had already finished his meal by the time my sandwich came through. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait.   The eclair was good, but that was about it.",

This is a great choice for a first date, meet a friend or even a casual business meeting.  Leone Cafe's corner street location with its outside seating will remind you of something out of a Paris postcard souvenir: Aesthetic, European, etc. Tivoli Village in itself is a nice escape from the cool but often glitzy, gaudy tone dominant in Las Vegas. Leone Cafe is a nice addition to the Tivoli Village atmosphere.  I really dig the interior with its marble table and countertops, illustrated menus and charming chandeliers. It's a step above your average mom and pop cafe. Complimentary waters are available on one side of the wall and big windows makes the room feel bigger than it actually is.  For foods we had the Guacamole Chicken Wrap, Champagne Chicken Salad and Spaghetti. The portions are bigger and tastier than I expected. I really didn't put much thought on the food but I gotta say it was pretty good. I feel like I cannot give a complete review because I have not tried the coffee or any of their popular desserts.",

Also this is an allergy friendly place to eat. Although I don't think there is a separate kitchen that is gluten free - There is something here for everyone ranging from gluten free scones and options and they will work with other food allergies like dairy etc.   I always get the champagne chicken salad even for breakfast! It's so good. But there are savory options for hose with a sweet tooth and juices and egg white omelette for those looking for health options !   Also this place has great people watching and a fun welcoming atmosphere on the weekends - lots of Las Vegas locals meet up here and have a wonderful time. Highly recommend this spot for breakfast or brunch and after take a stroll through the village or farmers market on the weekends !",

My kids ordered a waffle on our last visit and it was a bit soggy, not crisp, but they ate it. I find the food a bit of a hit and miss. The service from people refilling coffee and bussing tables was outstanding, but ordering is a bit of a pain. They need a better queue- it can get very crowded and confusing.  Their coffee is good and it's so nice to sit outside and take in the ambiance.",

My last Champagne Salad was so terrible (and I've have almost 10 in the past year) Dried out chicken - completely uneditable. The others with with received dried out chicken on their salads too.

It's also very shiny and clean-looking, which I always appreciate when I'm eating somewhere.  I got the \"white\" hot chocolate, which was very sweet and tasty. A friend raved over her chai latte. They have pastries and sandwiches in a very nice display, and serve hot breakfasts- yum.   The ambience strikes me as being more business-like and efficient than casual and laid back like a Starbucks or Sambalatte, which is fine. I could definitely come here and relax for a short while with a magazine, but I don't know that this is a place I'd want to hang out for a couple of hours as I would at the other places I mentioned.  This is a charming place, though, and I appreciate the effort to make it so.",

The salad was light yet packed full of flavor,  not drenched with dressing. The tiramisu is rich and not sweet.  I got to sit out on the patio and enjoy my lunch. Service was fantastic too! Definitely worth a visit. And I will be back!",

My cappuccino was weak and flat and had nothing to recommend it.  (I'm guessing old beans?)  My companions' coffees were served in paper cups.  Weird and inconsistent, as my drink was in a \"real\" mug.  (We all ordered our drinks \"for here.\")  The barista last night seemed to be more interested in getting our orders DONE than getting our orders done WELL.  I liked my chocolate chip cookie -- soft, chewy, and loaded with chips.  Hubby's tiramisu pleased him enough and my friend's cheese sandwich was \"yummy.\"  So, food seemed good, drinks were meh, and overall ambience was charming.  I don't think I'll be coming again soon, as I quite like Sambalatte and would rather patronize a place that supports local musicians (live music!) and installs friendly staff.  Maybe my experience was a one-off 'meh' experience, but first impressions are important (unfortunately!).",

The tables have a pretty marble top and the chairs are comfortable- both inside and outdoor. They also serve free cucumber, lemon water that is so refreshing. Especially after a coffee or thick smoothie!   The food though, is where the five stars comes from. The eggs florentine is next level delicious! It's the best!! And the smoothies are always yummy!

Being from Las Vegas and now living near Seattle, I have come to really appreciate unique cafes, rather than your run of the mill coffee chain.   I met some friends here late one night (30 minutes before the place closed, no less) and there was still several tables of people sitting around chatting, and the employees were still sweet and pleasant even though we were there so close to closing (we promised to be out of there quick!). Two of us had their hot chocolate (it was late and I didn't want caffeine) which was so rich and delicious, and the third had a Nutella latte, and said it was fabulous. This place is a much cuter alternative for a coffee date than any of the coffee chains that are everywhere in Vegas -  a must try! You won't be disappointed.",

Right now my favorite dish is the Alfredo pasta, which comes with either spaghetti or penne noodles, Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms, pesto bread, and parmesan cheese. The portions are quite large, so I'm always able to split them or take food to go. Drinks can also be taken to go. You can make your own custom smoothie. The coffees are super yummy! I strongly suggest the hazelnut latte. This place is great for any meal time of the day. Its location is very convenient too because it's located next to many shops and other attractions.

    "text": "I know lots of people love this place but for me it is mediocre at best. I have been here five times or more and had high hopes each time and each time disappointed.   Today I had the California club sandwich with chips, fruit cup, lemonade and macaroons. Other visits I have had breakfast items and their \"famous\" Nutella latte. Everything I have had has been bland and over hyped. I asked for no cucumber and an extra side of aioli on my sandwich today and brought it home to hopefully enjoy. Well to my disappointment there was extra cucumber and almost no aioli. I had to put mayo on it so it wasn't horribly dry. There was a lot of meat which was surprising. There was almost no cheese or tomato. The chips were delicious but too thick.   I moved onto the lemonade and which I was looking forward to because how can you mess up lemonade. Well it was not fresh squeezed or fresh anything. It was clearly some kid of powder and not good at all. The macaroons were the only thing that could have saved my lunch. They looked exactly how macaroons should so I was excited. One bite into it and I was not thrilled. I had lime and raspberry and they both tasted like chemicals. You couldn't tell the two apart! The last time I was here and had the Nutella latte I was disappointed because it didn't taste like anything! Very bland food and artificial tasting drinks and sweets.   The service wasn't good either. The guy putting the order in was rushing everyone and obviously didn't put the orders in well. Everything took over 15 minutes to come out. I have already given this place too many chances and won't be back again.",

I get it to go so I can drink it while I shop.  This time I got a palmier. It was huge. Sweet pastry cookie with delicious roasted sugar layers. I loved it.  The staff seemed more efficient than previous visits. The first time I ordered they gave me a number and brought my togo drink to my table. This allowed me to enjoy the fresh air and wait for my drink outside. The second time I ordered though they insisted on calling my name and making me wait in a very busy area. I hope this will change.",

I'm a fan of their Nutella Cappacino and also sometimes have them make a Nutella Latte.  Their Cafe Milan (cinnamon and nutella) was good, but a bit too sweet when I had it.    The crepe there wasn't my cup of tea, it was a bit doughy and the filling just didn't do it for me.  The other desserts I've tried there that weren't too bad were the chocolate dome, truffles, and tiramisu.  The staff was pretty friendly there too.",

They offer both Almond milk and Soy milk which is a huge plus in my book...being lactose intolerant and all. They have a good selection of desserts. I wasn't too fond of their biscottis but their cookies and tiramisu were excellent.   Great place too stop before, during, or after shopping or dining in TIvoli Village.",

I can't drink straight up hardcore coffee like her but when I do order here I like to get the expensive nutella cappuccino or caramel cappuccino.  Mmmm.    Because there aren't many places to grub around Tivoli I can see why people frequently come by here.  One day I'll try to grab a bite but for now I only use this place to snack and sip on caffeine.",

I figured I'd give them another shot since my son loves hot cocoa!  We walked in and the staff were both at the pick-up window and I thought one of them had greeted me and I said Hi and walked up to them and they looked at me like I was nuts : (   She then asked for my order and all that jazz, I ordered a iced coffee with hazelnut and my nugget got a hot cocoa. We paid and I looked at my receipt only to notice they charge an additional dollar for flavor! No bueno! We got our drinks and went to the play area.   We sat and my son took a swig and was mortified! He got mad at me and told me the cocoa was really hot! I guess we are used to Starbucks where they do the childrens cocoa at a lower temp... I was kind of annoyed because I'm sure its not that difficult to adjust the temp of a drink : ( I took a drink of my iced coffee and was not satisfied; it had no hazelnut taste!  Also, the coffee itself wasnt amazing, especially for the price! I've had better at McDonalds!   Perhaps I just got a bad batch or something, but I wasnt pleased as much as I wanted to be!",

I would definitely recommend coming early as the place gets packed!   How it works: you place your order at the counter, they'll give you a number, and the servers will deliver your food when it's ready.   Food:  Shakshoka skillet: comes with chorizo, avocado, marinara sauce, 2 eggs (I got over easy eggs), and 2 prices of bread. I thought the chorizo was mixed in with the dish but instead it was placed on the side. And you only get 3 dingy pieces. At least give me a few more pieces! However, the flavor was good and there were plenty of veggies in it.   Medium chai latte: I should've gotten the large! It wasn't overly sweet so this is something I would get again. Only thing is I wished they served it a bit hotter temperature wise.   Service here is great! The waitress and the owner was attentive and always made sure our water was filled. Some people in the group got bottomless mimosas and the waitress did a great job of refilling those too.   I would for sure come back here especially since I want to try some other items on their menu.",

The ambiance is quite nice and the sound system is good but can get a little loud when it's busy but thats expected and a good sign.  When the weather is right the outside patio is lovely.",

You order one from here and it comes in a small size! Too small for My liking.  The chicken salad sandwich was awful. The chicken was hard and dark chunks! Hardly any flavor and the chips were stale! I hurt my gums eating them. The lox bagel was ok. Hard to mess that one up. Only came here because there was an hour long wait at the other place across the way and it was cold and windy to wait so thought we'd try this place. Bad idea. Oh and the seating in there was horrible! Is there not a fire code violation how they have this place jam packed with all these tables! I was seriously hyperventilating with anxiety from being so enclosed with so many people. I wonder if this is what jail feels like...",

I also ordered the Nutella cappuccino in a cute red cup. The atmosphere definitely matches the location of the cafe, as well. It doesn't even feel like you're in Las Vegas.   The staff, however, is very hit and miss. The cashier was rude and spoke to me with so much attitude. Another waitress was actually very friendly and personable. Then disaster hits and my sister finds hair in her banana Nutella Crepe. Another waiter comes to check on us and we tell him about the hair. He takes it back with no emotion whatsoever and brings us a new one. Well there goes my appetite...   Other than that, service is fairly quick and the food isn't bad. The prices definitely reflect the location, but it's still a nice cafe with plenty of tables inside and out.",

The prices are also super affordable and the service is really quick!   10/10 recommend. Such a perfect lunch spot with friends or even a brunch/afternoon date.

Everything I've tried here is amazing and so flavorful. You go inside order your food and within 10 mins they bring it out. Now about the service it is not the best but, you don't come here for the service you come here for the food. There is a very nice gentleman who may be the general manager or owner who gives amazing service. Everyone else gives about mediocre service but, like I said you come here for the food not the service. They have a wide variety of food to select from and also baked goods.

The portion size was just right but small maybe compared to other pasta places.  The sauce was rich and creamy. It was a tomato based sauce but had a rich butteriness I could not get enough of.  Small pieces of chicken that were not over powering.   The bread on the side had lots of melted Parmesan which was great for dipping into the sauce.

They let me substitute iced tea instead, which was very nice of them.   The iced tea was bad! Cloudy and tasted off. I think it was Earl grey, which I usually love.   Service was pretty good.

Aside from having great coffee they have a ton of options for tea and smoothies. They also have a full menu rather than just finger foods. I got an egg white wrap that was delicious! I've gotten the bagels and lox before which was probably the best I've ever had, came with a lot of salmon, onions, and capers. Portions are big too. A little bit more expensive than an average coffee shop but you get what you pay for. Downsides are their wi fi sucks. It's slow, it disconnects, and you only get two hours of use. This place gets super busy too by about 11 am and LOUD so not a place I would recommend to get any work done. The bathrooms are also a trek away, but one of the staff members was willing to watch my laptop and things while I went which was nice.",

Not only do they have the best food including amazing salads the Nutella cappuccino is amazing. I love the champagne salad with grilled chicken an strawberries. Great customer service  always smiling. But beware they get very busy at lunch. An sometimes it's a bit noisy inside. I highly recommend going there an trying the food an coffee if you haven't. Great place to just relax an spend time talking with friends.",

We ordered brewed coffee, house special latte (with cinnamon and honey) and a Mediterranean omelette that came with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Their servings are huge! Omelette was soft, and had the right amount of cheese and spinach paired with slices of crisp baguette, cottage cheese, tuna salad, olives and cream cheese on the side. The cucumber salad was also refreshing. The coffee and latte were equally amazing.   Carpe the diem and visit Cafe Leone!",

From the moment you step through the door, the aroma of the cafe envelopes the senses drawing you in. The sophistication of the conversation that surrounds you creates a learning environment that is both titillating to the intellect and captures the interest of visiting patrons.   If you are looking for a place that understands the fundamentals of business from a price point perspective as well as amazing customer experience, Leone Cafe is the place to be. Do not be surprised if you find yourself a frequent member of this establishment. Your every need will be accommodated and the pleasantries of those who work there will create an experience unlike anything you have experienced.   The only recommendation I would provide is for consideration of flow logistics. The popularity of this establishment creates a backflow of patrons at times, which can be off-putting to new comers. But once you are immersed in the culture of this establishment, you will not want to leave.",

    "text": "In the heart of Tivoli Village in Summerlin, is a beautiful urban Italian Cafe appropriately named Leone Cafe.  Leone Cafe was created by coffee lovers for coffee lovers.  The theme of the shop is based upon a traditional Italian coffee shop concept.  They have the fundamental Italian espresso-based drinks such as the Cappuccino, Breve, Americano, Macciatho etc. along with a new flare on fresh baked goods and specialty homemade breakfasts.  The Nutella Cappuccino is a must, it combines the sweet, chocolaty taste of our favorite Italian hazelnut spread and the dreamy espresso.  Lots of stuff to choose from the breakfast menu, they all looked fabulous.  I chose the Flaming Omelette, it was very light yet rich in flavor, swift, but satisfying.  This is one of the elegant cafes I've been to in the valley, it felt very European with the brightly lit chandeliers and fancy tables. I couldn't help feel sophisticated and blend in within the ambiance that surrounded me, I just love the coffee culture.",

The omelette came without chicken so I brought it to the  counter where they offered to bring a side of chicken. The side of grilled chicken came and I ate 1/2 of it with the omelette. I took the rest home, refrigerated it, then grilled it lightly for dinner. The entire next day I was sick as a dog with typical food poisoning symptoms. And as with food poisoning, it had passed by Monday evening.  After carefully reviewing what I ate Sunday, I'm convinced the chicken was the culprit. Either the chicken was under-cooked (it seemed ok), or more than likely, the cook used the same tongs to plate the chicken that he used to place the raw breast on the grill ... a common restaurant practice called cross-contamination.  I won't be back.",

Beautiful atmosphere and decor, great ambiance, and simply amazing food!  Large outdoor patio seating that is covered in Tivoli Village and simply a great space!  All of the servers are at the top of their game anticipating needs and providing great customer service!  We were mostly served by Jonathan and our busser Brian who both were amazing in making sure our food was there quickly, empty plates were taken away quickly, and the coffee and water were kept full all the time!  Brian suggested another table when he noticed we needed more room with our family and Jonathan kept accommodating us till we were happy including keeping the deserts in the back till we were ready and getting us covered coffee for the patio so it stayed fresh and hot.  We missed a coffee on our initial order, but he didn't think twice about making it right without making it a big deal!  The food was rich and full.  The plates are large to accommodate a large serving.  If you're going there with a family and kids expect that you'll need another table for room (which they will happily accommodate) for you!  The manager and or owner (sorry didn't catch your name) noticed our anxiety with the room we had, came over and offered whatever it took to accommodate us and make us happy!  Solid customer service from this gentlemen who took (our) problem, owned it, and accompanied us to a fabulous experience!  We are definitely coming again thank you!",

I like this place better than Sambalatte - it's much more a restaurant than a coffee shop.   I LOVE that they have a dog-friendly shaded patio area. I take my dog there and people are always super friendly. The food is solid - with large portion sizes as well. AND it's not just a big serving of mediocre food - the menu is well thought out and it's good quality.  Everything I've had here has been great.   Also, the juices are delicious and the coffee drinks are great.  The prices are a little higher than I'd like on the drinks (I'd say the food is on target, it's a little pricey but because the portions are big and the ambience is great, I'd say on point).

He didn't even clean the counters when he was done and I even saw his foot touch the coffee filter staged near the coffee machine. There was coffee and food being placed on the same counters!!!!   Has this guy never heard of a LADDER??? Do they not realize you clean the place when it's CLOSED?!?!? Not only was he walking on counters, he was creating all this dust when he wiped down the shelves!!!! Yuck!!!!  If they can do this in front of customers, I can't imagine what they do in the kitchen.",

I had the Fired Up Wrap w/scrambled eggs, avocado, tomatoes and a nice spicey sauce..EXCELLENT!  HOWEVER...reason for the 3 stars is they need to \"CLEAN UP\" their act. The service has always been on the below average side to me. It was a cool morning and we asked if the heater (only had one but need more) could be turned on, but it was broken. Tables were dirty and I have no idea was was on the inside or outside of the salt and pepper shakers. It's unfortunate because they are typically busy, especially on weekends so they probably don't see a need to \"clean it up\"! Bummer.",

No matter what meal I enjoy, everything has been great. I get a cappuccino from here at least twice a day, and occasionally eat breakfast and lunch. All items on the menu are fresh, they are willing to accommodate special requests, and the speed at which the food comes to your table would rival some FastFood places around the world.   I just finished eating their egg white wrap (breakfast is available all day), which they made without feta cheese for me. Their salad with apple, walnuts and chicken is a great, healthy alternative to the more heavier items on the menu - they enjoy putting cheese into many of their dishes, which you can ask them to remove if so desired (I am sure you would have gathered by now: I'm not a big fan of it! ;)).   Above all, the service is always friendly and professional by the predominantly younger service team. Always a joy to eat here and I look forward to the next time I am in town.",

The coffee and tea is excellent the food is also good the ambiance is good as well it's just very crowded most of the time. They always play great music and it's a great place to go to people watch on the weekends during the farmers market or on holidays when it's cold outside and Tivoli village is decorated.  I want very much to like this place a lot better and give it more stars.  Also the chairs are really uncomfortable, and if you're tall expect a couple bruises on your knee from knocking it at the low tables. All in all Foods great drinks are great and ambiance is terrific --if it weren't for those couple things and the place was a little more cozy ride give it a full 5 stars and I would frequent it more often",

Everything was spot-on! The salmon was fire-grilled and delicious. Really loved the mashed potatoes that accompanied the daily special, the mushroom soup was scrumptious. The ahi tuna wrap was filled with fresh veggies and the chimichurri sauce on the side was so good, we asked for more. Very impressed with the Nutella cappuccinos...not too sweet, very creamy and was at the perfect temperature. The staff was fast and very friendly.",

I came in the next day and I have to agree it was the best iced chai I'd ever had, and one of the best lunches I've had in awhile. I got a Caesar wrap and I could tell the chicken was good quality which I appreciate so much. My boyfriend got a breakfast croissant sandwich at 3pm, so that was pretty cool and he said it was delicious. I'm excited to come back and try more things! They also have easy access if you park in the underground parking under the Capella building :)",

Their breakfast is I think 12$ but you get ALOT and it comes with drinks.  I love the design and the fact you don't have a waiter (so no tipping, waiting, etc) the service is still very very very very good. You can tell who ever is running this place knows what he is doin.  Anyways if you want to find out what a latte is suppose to look and taste like. Go here!   I hope maybe I have made some one understand that latte is not Starbucks. If so, it was all worth it haha",

Not bad...at least the pasta itself was cooked appropriately, but it wasn't that flavorful and it was really only saved by the fact that they provided red pepper flakes on the table.

Are the reasons that would make me go every other day! HOWEVER our drinks were not at all on point! I've walked through the cafe many times to take my daughter to the park and never stopped to enjoy it. My mom wanted coffee so it was time! No kids in tow just a girls coffee date :) I was excited to finally try this place! I noticed they get some pastries from manon, namely the Frazier cake(YUM) We ordered and sat down and waited to be served. Okay so it was night time so no caffeine for me I had an iced chai latte. I know all it is, is milk and flavoring over ice lol but there was barely any flavoring!!!! My mom order a white chocolate mocha with caramel added. It arrived lookin beautiful with a heart design so I could tell she was excited!! Well it tasted like a cappuccino. It would have been fine had she not ordered her specific white chocolate mocha with caramel added! So I being the nice daughter I am brought her drink back to the barista. I explained what my mom had ordered and told her maybe it was the wrong drink. I mean there was no other flavor besides espresso in this beautiful drink. She then took her coffee spoon(the long one used to make the drinks) and stirred it, mind you the drink came with a spoon I already thought of this route!! She said she put alot of whatever so it should be sweet. The barista intimidated me!! I told her I'll go see what mom says and before I completely turned she offered me a side of caramel. It helped fortunately but not enough to say Leone is my home :(  so many things rooted for this place to be amazing but the less then tasty drinks and the scary barista made me run for the hills. The two stars are for the location/ ambience and the fact they serve manon pastries.",

I'm already at 5 stars in general. I see intended cafe. Looks awesome. Lots of cool outdoor seating. It feels like Europe.  Still 5 stars. I ordered quiche with a salad. And a granita. The granita tastes amazing. Still 5. I taste the salad. Bottled italian dressing. Really? That's something a 1 star place would do. Quiche is a little too wet and soft inside but tastes good. 3-4 stars. Waitress never comes to get my plate. I have to bring it inside after like 30 mins of it sitting there. I bring it inside and politely ask where it goes. A girl inside smugly says \"usually you just leave it outside but here\" and has me hand it to her. I notice like 5 staff inside doing nothing, just hanging around. Two were folding napkins. Clearly too busy to clear off my table of old plates. That's a 1 star moment to me.  That said, it's a very comfy place to hang and have a coffee and people watch. Or have a business meeting. And the food doesn't suck. So...3. Final answer.",

But today I had it, My experience with my order was unbelievable my coffee was bitter then normal and the batista, argued with me that he added the correct amount of flavoring. I didnt feel like arguing, but he insisted on remaking my drink. Which was excellent customer service on his behalf. So I had time to wait for two drinks and my bagel still wasnt ready. Which I thought was odd!   When the barista gave me my bagel I inspected it, and it was burnt, and hard.  The waitress asked me if I didnt wanted it well done?  I was thrown off, usually well done bagels are acquired taste. I said I didn't order that, she asked me well how would I like it toasted.... again I was thrown off!  I said regular not burnt!  Not interested in eating a bagel hard as a rock!!!!   This alone pissed me off, I dont plan on coming back, the outcome of my experience,  was unnecessary,  and with the prices they charge you think they would be a little more courtesy.   So I rated this place with a two stars... AND CALL ME OLD FASHION BUT WHEN TAKING ORDERS I HIGHLY DOUBT ITS PROFESSIONAL TO EAT YOUR BREAKFAST OR TEXT ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE IN FRONT OF PAYING CUSTOMERS. So that 2 stars might be a generous rating considering my numeruous experiences",

Love that they serve tea (a variety of them) in big French press pots and they even have almond milk if you ask.    Two faves to eat at Cafe Leone:   the Champagne Chicken and Berries Salad,  Filled with fresh grilled chicken, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries along with walnuts, bleu cheese and a delish dressing on dark (healthy) field greens.  I never get tired of this.  the roast beef sort of patty melt kind of sandwich.  The beef is so flavorful with their special sauce, carmelized onions, a little horseradish and more.  Love it when I want something hearty and comforting.    Leone the owner is there most of the time.  He really cares about making things right for you.",

I've also had a Double Espresso and a Large Mocha. The Espresso was OK, but the Mocha was delicious without being overly sweet. And somehow, the coffee art managed to preserve itself through most of that large cup!  My first time at Leone Cafe was a little strange. For some reason, the place totally smelled like I was in an airplane. I thought it was purely due to the coffee aroma, but Jade W appropriately pointed out that it could be the new building smell. I guess it's a combination, but in any case, I didn't get that feeling on my second visit.  I'll be honest. I still prefer Sambalatte. I just like the atmosphere over there better. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with Leone. It has a pretty interior with ample seating. I'm a fan.",

So I'll start off with the good: the food here is all freshly made and you can taste it. It's located in Tivoli village so the view is fantastic. The pastries, if you go in the morning are to die for. The orange juice is top shelf. The bad: the food here isn't anything special. I've had the sandwiches, omelettes and bagels. They're good and if I'm at Leone I'll order them but they're nothing for me to go out of my way. My only major gripe is one that's close to my heart. They don't have regular bacon, only turkey bacon. That's completely unacceptable to me, because while I know turkey bacon is so much better for me, it's not real bacon and I don't play that. Having actual bacon for those who want it would probably met them an extra star because I can't in good conscience go into a restaurant knowing that they serve breakfast food, but no real bacon. Overall, great desserts and atmosphere, but suffering from a serious lack of bacon",

I wasn't the yelper I am today (ha) when I frequented this wonderful establishment, else I'd have sung their praises long ago. The atmosphere is just perfect. I love the food, the beverages, the staff, people watching, dog watching...I look forward to my next visit home so I can come enjoy a leisurely morning at Leone!",

The manager, I think he's Italian, opened a second register and moved us through the line in minutes. We sat outside in the sun. The surroundings at Tivoli bring back memories of sitting street side at a cafe in many European towns. Our order came quickly. The Eggs Florentine was a refreshing plate filled with fresh garden flavours, the Pastrami Melt delivered it's signature sauerkraut flavour followed by the kicker of melted cheese and lightly buttered toasted artisan bread. The bacon spinach quiche was so fluffy and flavorful we wanted to take it home with us. The service is excellent, attentive yet not imposing as to allow the peaceful surroundings to add it's own flavor to the mood. Thank you Cafe Leone we will be back many times.",

    "text": "Leone Cafe has the potential to be amazing - they have incredible and creative drinks, a great ambience, scrumptious pastries, but their customer service is severely lacking.   I've been in three times, and each time I've ordered the same drink - chocolatte espressionale. It's hot chocolate with a shot of espresso and it's absolutely delicious - strong and not overly sweet. This morning, I ordered the same drink, and it came out iced. I went up to let them know I was given the wrong beverage, and the barista rudely told me it comes iced, and I needed to specify hot. I take issue with this for several reasons - 1) I've ordered this several times and it's always come hot. 2) If this is accurate, the cashier is responsible for asking me iced or hot - I am an ex-barista, this is a standard. 3) It says HOT chocolate, how does it make any sense for it to come iced by default? I pointed at what I ordered on the menu and repeated it, to make sure we were all on the same page, explained myself again - at this point another person working told me it comes iced. It was a busy morning but they were visibly annoyed, which is not acceptable.   I knew there was miscommunication but there was no way I could have explained myself again a different way - the baristas were just not listening. I went back to my table, looked at my receipt, and saw that they charged me for a chocolate latte, which costs more  and does come iced. However, if the baristas had listened to me and looked at where I was pointing, this miscommunication would have been instantly understood. But they weren't. At this point I was a little frustrated, I went back up and explained what happened AGAIN (I feel like this is their responsibility) and asked if they would just give me a larger size coffee to make up for the price difference. At this point nobody had apologized, which was annoying.   Their manager came over, and I explained what happened - since she was listening to me, she instantly knew what I was talking about - the cashier heard my order wrong (understandable) but the baristas didn't listen when I brought it to their attention and tried to tell me I ordered wrong. She apologized for the way it was handled and I let her know it wasn't a big deal, it was just poorly handled when I brought my drink up. She was very nice and got my coffee out to me quickly.   I know this seems like a such a small thing to complain about, but their customer service needs work (aside from the manager working, who was lovely.)  I really do enjoy this place, love the coffee and the atmosphere, but my experience today was not top notch.",

There's chicken in their caprese, just a btw. I wasn't too upset, since my diet isn't super restrictive, but I felt a bit inept for not reading the menu thoroughly. The tiramisu was light and filling for what it was worth. I didn't pay for my meal, but I'd like to think it was pretty fair for being a bit boutique-ish cafe.  Service was laid out pretty well. You order at the counter, they deliver to you. We were checked on fairly often and offered refills every time.   (As for gnats/flies, that's a common issue anywhere that's hot and has access to the outside. Don't like it? I'd advise you to eat at home, or at least let the restaurant remake your meal/drink.)  It'd would be a great place to bring a friend or to read.",

I'm not a fan of the Tivoli Village area but proximity to work makes it a good spot for lunch now that I've discovered (and thoroughly explored!)  their salads! The Champagne Chicken Berries is my favorite, but the Apple Chicken is a close second. Both are ~$11 and served in a small boat. No joke, these salads are massive, enough for a hearty lunch AND leftovers. And while they may not be the healthiest, you can request the dressing on the side and ask the to go light on the bleu cheese (or sub feta). But what's the fun in that?! Dine-in service is attentive, helpful, and happy to bring you anything you need. Can't believe I underestimated this place! Or used so many exclamation points!",

    "text": "Enjoyed my first experience at Leone Cafe and it definitely won't be the last.  I came here after getting a haircut in the area to grab lunch.  I got the Chicken caparese sandwich with balsamic glaze, the bacon, spinach cheddar quiche and a cup of the Leone Latte Especial.   Sandwich is grilled panini style with a good crispy in each bite.  Flavors were good, decent and typical of any sandwich.  I got this served with the hash brown.  Potatoes shredded and browned with a tad of salt on top.    The quiche was a bit too oily for my liking.  Good flavors and the crust edge is crisp and crunchy, just the way I like my quiche.  Filling was what was oily, probably because of the bacon and the fat not being rendered enough.    The most memorable item for me was the Leone Latte Especial. A cup of espresso with steamed milk, cinnamon and honey.  My first sip, I was surprised how well these flavors worked with each other.  Usually when I drink my lattes, I don't like to stir it because of the fun designs made by the barista, but for this cup I should have because by the end of my drink, it was all honey on the bottom which was also a delicious surprise.  So it's really up to you if you want to stir or not.   Next time I want to come and try the desserts!  I was too full to have a bite of anything else that day.  Until next time.",

Which means without reproaches or guilt. I loved the Latte which was made with honey and cinnamon. The service was great and the food arrived really quick. The salad had a great taste and the perfect size for a light lunch if you have a heavy dinner that awaits you. I highly recommend this place and definitely coming back to try their Brunch and the pizza for dinner. Also they include a glass of wine if you go for dinner.",

If you get a regular brew coffee they go around every so often with a carafe to refill.   Pastries are great too. My favorite is the tiramisu.  Great service and the meals/drinks come out in a timely manner.",

My mom and I ended up getting the same thing, which was the spinach and sun dried tomato quiche and green juice.   Hers was very burnt on top so she sent it back for another one, which was burnt again. Mine was fine but I was kind of disappointed because of how unflavorful it was. The manager/supervisor was very kind. He gave us a complimentary cannoli and brought us out a different quiche (which was way better) since my mom was not satisfied with hers. Great service.",

With free wifi and refills on coffee/tea, this place is usually pretty busy.  If there is any downside to this bistro is that they lack electrical outlets for the number of people with laptops (guess you need to go to Starbucks if the number of available outlets is a necessity).  I usually get the Egg White and Asparagus Omelette with fruit for breakfast. If you're health conscious, this is a great choice.  If you're around during the lunch hour, I recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad. It's a big portion and super yummy.  If you want to stop by for desert, they have a good variety of Italian treats.  Since I'm here at least once a week, I highly recommend this place.",

Tres warm! We had the Mediterranean omelet but I had to add bacon for protein . Kids had the white cheese pizza, Nutella crepes, and Belgium waffles. Adults loved the coffee- and we are picky about coffee- really good Italian roast blend. Servers are always attentive there circling all the tables to make sure your cup and glass is filled.

It's not necessarily amazing but it's the only cute and casual cafe that I saw in the area so it's ideal to stop by for some lunch and coffees. The sandwiches were tasty and the pancakes were good too however the condiments that came with the p'cakes (jam and cream) weren't very flavoursome. My sandwich came with old bruised and brown avocado but as soon as I pointed it out to a different server to the one who felt it was suitable to give to me, they were very good to get a generous fresh portion. The breakfast croissant was good and full of ingredients, however I feel it could have done with some more flavour or a sauce to break up the dry ingredients.  If I was in the area again and fancied a coffee and a cake in the shade, this is a nice spot.",

    "text": "So I came to this restaurant a few days ago as a recommendation from a friend of mine that lives here in Vegas for a while. After seeing all the cool pictures on Yelp of the foods desserts & drinks it was on my list of places to go.   I was in the neighborhood and figured I'd stop by to check out this place. Since I never been here before it was difficult to figure out parking or where the actual restaurant was. after driving around I found the place and wanted a close by parking. there was a self parking garage but I didn't want to go thru all the trouble and just wanted to find a open street parking and walk on in. I found one on the next street after circling around. Anyways.. upon entering the place I noticed it was charming with all the display of foods behind the glass counter. It was kinda busy but not too bad. I ordered the champagne chicken berry salad, smokey eggs plate with fruits as well as a small latte. Prices are very reasonable here and isnt going to break your bank! the salad was like $11, smokey salmon was $9 and small latte was $3!  I opted to sit outside on the patio because weather was nice and alot of customers were also outside. There were swarms of flies and also bees flying around my table. I literally had to stand up or move away when the bees would decide to settle on my table. never will I sit outside again. it's not the restaurants fault of course. but the thought of having to shoo away all the flies and bees trying to land on my food was stressful. so word of advice..  do not sit outside if you mind the flies & bees swarming around you and your food. I dont know if it was mostly my table that had it or if it was all over...  The staff was helpful and brought out everything I needed. maybe cause my table was right by the door where they go in and out but it was helpful. I even left them a nice little tip for all their help. Staff and managers were awesome.  So the latte I ordered was yummy. the salad I ordered was very tasty! the smokey eggs was delish... but I found hair in my food. the manager took it away right away and tried to correct the situation.  he comped my plate brought out a fresh plate and also sent a berry tart to my table. That was very sweet and professional of him and I appreciate the effort to make me happy. Finding things in food happens from time to time at any restaurant so I wasnt too mad to find it when it does. Overall I would come back and try it again with some friends.... but indoors next time.",

It can be packed most days, but they do have a large patio with seating as well.   The staff is very attentive and say hello when I come in.   They offer omelets, crepes, skillets, juices and pastries for breakfast with pizza, salads, and more for lunch. Their dessert selection is out of this world yummy!!  I love The Mediterranean omelet! I highly recommend this place for both breakfast and lunch. I have never been there for dinner.   The other thing that I like about the location is that there is plenty of parking in the underground parking area with an escalator that takes you straight to the restaurant door. As someone who values safety, this area has lots of security and I feel safe when I shop and dine there.",

The smell of coffee filled my senses as I paced towards the cafe, carefully savoring every detail of Tivoli Village. You can't go wrong with its exquisite European touch and sophisticated vibe but I can't help but question the quality of their fruit smoothies.  $3.75 (tax included) for a small fruit smoothie isn't bad. Plus, you can add up to 3 flavors (including mango, strawberry, blueberry, banana, pineapple etc.) with either orange juice, apple juice or regular as its base.  I opted for mango-banana with a milk base and despite it sounding really healthy, not to mention, being made at a really classy location, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. There was just no wow factor to it. In fact, I believe I tasted way too much banana and almost no mango. My friend had a medium strawberry-banana smoothie and she didn't seem so enthusiastic about it as well. There's hope though because our other galpal couldn't stop raving about their yogurt (with fruits and granola). I don't exactly know how much it was and I tell ya, she had nothing but good things to say about it so you might want to try that out instead.   Nonetheless, the smoothie pulled down the rating a notch. Perhaps it could redeem itself next time I try another item on the menu. We'll see!",

It's only strength is in his location, otherwise, don't go. The cakes and pastries are super expensive but they are not fresh, they taste nothing and you can find on the strip high pastries and cakes quality for a cheaper price ! The manager is a cheap person who's looking for cheap products to make as much profit as possible, doesn't care about the quality he can deliver to his customers. The people at the cashier never smiles, they don't look happy to work there... a very negative place. I absolutely don't recommend it. Better have a coffee and a good pastry at Cheesecake Factory across the street at Boca Park where the employees are nicer and the patios are really cool.",

The dessert i always get is a chocolate croissant! Probably one of the best in vegas!  Overall staff is friendly...but a little odd how every employee ethnicity is asian. It just seems strange in my opinion. The managers come check up on you which is also a PLUS! but one seems to have a very moody face all the time.  I do suggest you come check this place out!",

At first i was a little put off because it took a while to come out but in the end it was very good and a nice big cup of coffee and oj. Plus the atmosphere,although a bit manufactured at Tivoli (WHAT ! were really not in Italy? Damn !) is nice I also like to get my car detailed here while i consume my delicious meals. Next up at Tivoli is the Poppy Den..more to folow.",

    "text": "While I am not a big Coffee drinker(I'm 5'7\" in new shoes)..... my wife is the biggest coffee addict in Vegas! She's on the Finnish Super-Model diet...... 5 pots of coffee & 2 packs of cigs a day! Ha! Just kidding, sometimes she only smokes 1 pack a day!  We met another couple at Leone Cafe, just to hang out & for her to catch up with her friend. This was the first time that I have been to The Tivoli Village. I have to say I like the layout & European feel to the whole place. It's nice just to wander around & window shop. It's almost like going to a cleaner, nicer European town.  About Leone Cafe, very friendly staff, huge areas both inside & outside to sit & enjoy your beverage. None of us had any of the wonderful looking desserts or treats, but we all went through a few beverages. The Nutella Cappuccino seemed to big hit with the ladies. I liked The Americano. For the hardcore, Leone Cafe, does not have the best coffee or coffee based beverages in the world, but they do brew a decent cup. I also wish that their proportions were bigger, for the price. The main charm of this clean cafe, is the huge open seating area, where you & your friends can sit, relax, enjoy your refreshments & gab to your hearts content, without other people's conversations interrupting your own groups musings. The staff also, never makes you feel like they need your table for other customers..... no matter how long you stay, even if you don't all order refills.   Bottom line, this a great place to meet up with friends from the other side of town & gossip. Let the college kids & soccer moms keep their Starbucks..... Leone Cafe is my kind of Coffee House.",

    "text": "This review is for coffee and the pastries.   I came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.  When looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:  Us: What is this pastry here?  Guy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker) Girl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!  I love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third.   Worst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:  Me: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please. The same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte? Me: A medium?  Guy: OK Me: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake. Guy: OK Me: How much are those? ---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---  Terrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said \"No, those are fine!\" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour? The two stars are for the barista..who seems to actually have a clue, since our drinks were totally on par. The rest of it though? No thank you.",

If you park underground, the escalator pops you up right in front of Leone's doors.  Service is very nice and attentive.  Prices are reasonable for quality.  Seating is extensive, both inside and out.    I chose an item from the special board.  The ice blended coffee toffee.  I ordered, sat outside with a few mags, and it was politely delivered to me soon thereafter.  It was served in a large glass.  $4.  Absolutely delicious.  On a previous visit, I've had the joy of the nutella cappucino - also a big winner!!!  The place to go for excellent coffee shop ambiance and delicious product!!!",

It is a great destination to check out!  When we do go on the weekends, the is our go-to spot to grab a little bite breakfast, coffee, etc. As simple as the menu is, it is always quite tasty. AWESOME Lattes! Love the outdoor patio! Great place to people watch!  They tend to be pretty busy on the weekend, but quieter on weekdays. The weekend staff usually seems a bit stressed out. Sometimes they are friendly, sometimes they just want your order and for you to MOVE ALONG! That area is a bit hit or miss. Overall no matter how busy, they are efficient and food comes without mishap. So it works.",

Fairly flat in flavor, and chicken looked and tasted as though it came out of a frozen sliced chicken package. Not egregiously expensive but also not something I care to ever have again. 3) Chocolate dome dessert. Too sweet. And too expensive at over $6. Wouldn't order it again.  On the plus side, the folks who work there are all nice and professional. But I don't think it's worth going to for anything other than the coffee beverages.",

Priced very reasonably, Leone Cafe is a nice spot in Tivoli.   The food itself isn't 5 star but the portions are nice for an afternoon or brunch meal. Service is off or on depending on your waiter is by they're pretty good about helping you out regardless of who your actual waiter is.   We had the open faced bagel sandwich and the florentine with chicken. We also had bottomless mimosas with selection of watermelon, berries, raspberries, or orange juice. Bottomless were only $14 which is incredible and there didn't seem like there was a time limit.   You order from the restaurant itself and they bring the food out. In total the meal was $52 without tip. Great spot to eat and chill for a few hours when the weather is nice. Have some drinks, bring the dog, and enjoy your meal.",

So if it's all sold out, lol sorry it was me! If you like thin crust and crispy pizza, you'll love the pizza here! They give coffee refills if you're dinning in ;) So don't be afraid to ask. All the workers are so nice here so don't forget to leave them a nice tip! They deserve it and the owner himself works as hard to serve everyone too. Hope this was helpful!",

When we walked up to Leone we noticed the place had a great area for outdoor seating, but no one was outside, which made us nervous, but we soon discovered it was the wind that drew everyone inside. The place was packed! It had that feel too like it was packed with regulars.  When we were waiting in line a woman in front of us said, \"what are you ordering, I'm here all the time with my husband and friends, I will tell you if it's good!\" We told her we were just ordering coffees and pastries, she laughed and said, \"oh, I thought you were eating eating... I'm sure those are good too.\"  Positive patron review right out of the gate is a good sign which also encouraged us to grab a thing or two we wouldn't have probably tried without the rave review.  FOOD: the house coffee was great and not too bitter. I had the almond milk vanilla latte (which kills me when it's too sweet, just a hint of vanilla is perfect), they nailed it. The blueberry muffin was light and fluffy with a slight crips on the top and the almond croissant was excellent!  We also ordered the watermelon water which tasted like a summer garden (I will be back for that).  The only reason this isn't 5stars is because I wasn't there to try their actual breakfast dishes which is their main bread and butter from what I can tell... but I would guess it's probably great too.",

I usually get breakfast here, and take friends from out of town here because it's beautiful and offers brunch with mimosas. It's very cute.   I have had a few of the pasta dishes here as well, they aren't bad. I can never finish all of the pasta tho. I recommend this restaurant.",

We got orange mimosas however they did not taste good at all :( the manager stopped by our table and asked me why I got up to exchange my fruit bowl. When I told him it had some mold in it he kindly offered us bottomless mimosas for the rest of our brunch. We ended up trying 2 different mimosas (watermelon and raspberry I believe). Unfortunately, we didn't like those either and couldn't finish a glass. I'd say the customer service was great and the staff is friendly and accommodating but we were not impressed with the food /:",

The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. They offer gluten free bakery options and dairy free coffee options which are much appreciated.  My husband loves the SW Wrap and I love the Panini English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich and the Champagne Chicken Berry Salad. When you order a latte, they make a beautiful design with the cream. Their desserts are so good too!  The service is always amazing. Everyone is so very friendly and attentive.  We can't wait to explore more options in the menu in the future! Thank you Leone Cafe!!",

    "text": "Came here recently on Sunday with my friend for brunch as we wanted to check out the Farmer's market that was hosted here on this day as well. The restaurant was really busy (i've never seen it this busy but then again ive never been here on a Sunday nor this early in the day). There were tons of people sitting outside despite the very warm Vegas weather. When we got up to the cashier to order, the system went down for a bit and needed to wait for it to restart. During the few minutes, the line backed up quite a bit.   My friend had ordered the \"Chinese Chicken Salad\" whereas I ordered the \"Chicken Guacamole Wrap\". Friend had asked for waters for us too and they gave us plastic cups with caps and straw. Later we realized other people had glass cups at their tables for dining in.   \"Chinese Chicken Salad\" consists of grilled chicken, mandarin orange, cucumber, mixed greens, sprouts, romaine lettuce, carrots, peanuts, wonton skins, and Chinese dressing  The salad overall was flavorful and nice. One of our more favorable salad's we've had so far. The dressing isn't overpowering and is light as well.   \"Chicken Gaucamole Wrap\" consists of grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, guacamole, and Greek yogurt spread  Grilled chicken is nice and flavorful. Good amount of guacamole where it was squeezing out every other bite. It was a nice and simple wrap. I had asked for a fruit cup as a side too instead of chips or salad (for obvious reasons lol). Fruit were nice and ripe. Sweet overall.  Saw a note while waiting for the cashier system stating it was closing the day after our visit for a few weeks for renovation of the kitchen/sitting area. At least we got to try it before it closed. Hopefully they'll be back soon as this place was pretty good and would be amazing to sit outside when the weather is a little bit cooler ! Would love to come back with my friend again for other foods for a nice lunch !",

Coffee and latte was amazing. We ordered Mediterranean omelette, banana Nutella crepe, fruit waffle and Leone breakfast croissant. I personally loved the breakfast croissant - it had avocado, crispy bacon and eggs. The crepe and waffle were little on the sweeter side. If you tend to not like too sweet, it's not meant for you.   This place had amazing deserts as well. I clicked a pick but was too full to try anything. Will definitely go back to try some. All in all- this was an amazing find.",

It is located in an area that has been constructed to look like Tivoli. Parking is easy and free in the underground garage.   The food was sooo amazing. We got a wrap, sandwich, and almond croissant.

A couple of my other friends have been here before so they already knew we should look for a table first then stand in line and place our order. After we place our order the cashier gives us a number to place on the table so the servers know where to bring the food.  Anyway, I ordered the florentine sandwich and added avocado on top w/ a caramel latte. Both were really good! I tried my friend's chai tea latte and that was amazing! We also were given a blueberry cheesecake on the house, it must have been the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!!   The only downside is that my friends and I had no choice but to sit outside on the sidewalk because it was packed. It was a little windy that day and we asked for a heater but the server said it was all being used inside. I think they need to leave a certain number of heaters outside for those that actually need it. Other than that it's a great place to come for breakfast, brunch, or whatever your heart desires. I would definitely be back especially to try out the other lattes & cappuccinos.",

This place is certainly spacious and can get quite busy. There are seats inside and outside from both sides of the cafe. They serve salads, sandwiches and crepes. Surely, there is a variety of drinks you can try as well. When visited this unique venue, I knew what i wanted. Ordered banana and nutella crepes with coffee. Taste was pretty good and so was the service. I should definitely go back. 5 stars for the location and service.",

They come around and refill your coffee for as long as you're sitting and the food is great! Plenty of healthy and light options. Excellent place to get some studying done or to take someone on a date. A lot of seating and it starts to get a rush around 11 am - noon. Perfect breakfast or brunch option with a lot of outdoor The service is great and there's always a gentlemen here with great attentiveness and concern for the guests. I see him here every time I come in and he's always very welcoming. He could be a manager or the owner but he's absolutely incredible. Even on a busy day he shows up to each and every table to see how your experience has been and if you need anything else.",

    "text": "Over the years I've stopped in for coffee a couple of times, but yesterday I finally enjoyed breakfast here. A very busy cafe, but I really enjoyed my food.  Leone Cafe was extremely busy on a Saturday morning. One of my friends that comes here regularly said it's always busy. The ordering system is to stand in line, order at the counter, wait at a table with your number, and have the food brought to you. The line to order was around a 10-20 minute wait. That'd be the main thing I'd say they have room to improve on.   The ambiance is that of a bustling cafe. The inside of the cafe is cute. Despite how crowded they were it seemed like they did have enough seating for everyone. Most of the seating is outside which is great. That area was full when I arrived as it appears that fills up first.   The service was great during my visit. The food did take a little longer than I expected to arrive at the table, but all of the employees were friendly. As we enjoyed our food an employee came by several times to refill drinks and check in with us. I was impressed that for how busy they were that they kept on top of taking care of their customers.   My breakfast was delicious. I ordered the Leone Breakfast Croissant. The croissant was so buttery and delicious. I'd love to return to try more pastry based on how much I enjoyed the croissant. The meat, cheese, tomato, and avocado all tasted great too. The portion size was perfect for me, filling, but not too much food. The Lemonade was a refreshing treat too.   Overall, this was a pleasant spot to enjoy breakfast with some friends. The ambiance, service, and food will guarantee my return visit.",

The ambiance of this cafe is lovely as it reminds me of cafes in Europe, not necessarily France. Only difference is that in Europe you sit down and the servers come to you while at Leone Cafe, you stand in que for your order. They will bring the food to your table and the servers are nice and quick.  There is outdoor seating in front of the cafe as well as indoor seating. It does get crowded so if you have a small party, you may want to get there early to grab a table or two. When I went to Leone there were five bruncers and we pulled together two small tables inside, which worked great.  As for food and drink, what I ate and drank was solid! If you enjoy honey, I recommend the Leone Latte as it has a honey drizzle. It is a lovely latte of a drink! The Bagel and Lox plate was your typical platter but the serving was large. I found that I did not have enough bagel for all the lox, cream cheese, capers, red onion, etc. That is a problem that I definitely welcome!  On my returning visits, I would like to try other items on their menu but I think I found the latte that I will stick with!",

My mom and I felt like we were back in Paris.  It is very similar in feel to places we had been in France.  Shortly after we order, our food was delivered and and it very good.  I'll come back again for their chopped salad and quiche.  They had so many different types of quiche to choose from.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and they have tons of outdoor seating.  You can sit down with a cup of coffee and just relax for a long time.  Lots of people were sitting down with friends having long catching up conversations while eating a pretty good meal.",

Their lattes are good and you can tell it's very fresh. TRY THE CHAI LATTE. Literally, best chai ice latte I have ever had in my life, it's so smooth and creamy and flavorful, not overly sweet or spicy. The pasta bolognese is really good esp paired with the pear salad. Desserts are alright, not the best, but will satisfy a craving. Staff is generally attentive and kind. But it can get really busy here and a few times we haven't had very good service but the last few times I've been here it has been good.",

How about a crepe or tiramisu, YEP THAT IS ALSO HERE!!  My first time at Leone I was a little confused. It's semi fast paced, you order at the counter and then sit with your number and everything is served to you. Even when they are slammed busy, they have such an accommodating staff to help you find seating, or refill your drinks. I seen the same manager (maybe owner) every time I go, and of course that is to be appreciated. You can tell he cares about the place, the food that is served, and of course the customer.  A few of our go-to dishes here are the spaghetti bolognese, egg salad sandwich, and the champagne and berries salad.  I also love the bambino coffee drink! If you want dessert, you can't go wrong, just order it. Seriously, they are all that good.  I also like the variety, it's so easy to accommodate my family when one doesn't eat meat, one wants pasta, and one wants wine. (Me, I want wine)  So I appreciate this Cafe more than they realize!",

The place offers lots of opportunity for people watching. A good number of  people in line calling up their favorite coffee drink or having a full on breakfast to enjoy at LC. At the 10am hour, the cafe is getting busy.    I ordered the Florentine breakfast sandwich. The eggs were prepared over medium on a toasted English muffin. The ingredients on the muffin were all delicious and fresh tasting (spinach, mushroom, cheddar cheese, hollandaise sauce, & crispy turkey bacon). This sandwich was super good. A side mixed green  salad came with the breakfast plate.    My family members all enjoyed  their meals. One could see (and taste)  that quality & freshness of ingredients are  what's important here.  The nephew indulged in the morning mimosas. At $16 for the bottomless mimosa, it's a  bargain.   Kudos to our servers, kitchen staff  and Lior (manager) for creating an excellent weekend meal for us. One of my favorite eating and coffee sipping stops in Las Vegas.",

You don't want to get to the counter and deal with the server who is impatient because you don't know what you want. The girls at the counter were not the most pleasant, although they tried to fake it. Whenever we are in a line or waiting for a table I use Yelp to bring up the menu(if available). It just makes it easier.  We did this here so we knew what we wanted, except the online menu and chalk board menu behind the register does not explain the side options. The girl at the register was annoyed that she had to explain the options and then repeat the options(sorry in a crowded dysfunctional layout I can not hear you).  Maybe they should not have a side door that has people waking in font of the line. The food is good, as are the smoothies. Very good smoothies. You have to find your own table. This can be a problem. We picked a table and the couple at the table next to it said they had that table also. We thought maybe a big group coming.  We changed tables and after we ate they where eating and the table we wanted was still open. I think they didn't want their view blocked(rude LV people). The staff that moves around the dinning area are on point.  Very attentive to what you need. It would be 4 stars if ownership could figure out how to get the flow to move better and monitor the tables. Pretty slow own the busing.",

The only thing that is disappointing is the price.  $2.25 for a small hot chocolate and the portion is about the size of an espresso cup.  But I'll take quality over quantity.  The cafe is large and comfortable.  I think it worked well for the Yelp book club because we all could sit in a big circle and not be crammed. Free wifi without a code! The outdoor seating area will definitely be the place to see and be seen once Tivoli Village has more than 3 stores.

    "text": "Needed to get out of the house after being cooped up inside all day and decided to go get a cocoa and play some scrabble with a friend.  While heading to Sambalatte, I checked yelp and realized that they were only open til 9pm (a mere 15 minutes from when my adventure had started) so I began looking for an alternative location with good reviews.  Behold, Leone Cafe! 4 solid stars and what seemed to be overwhelmingly positive reviews, and it was open until 10pm according to the great yelp, a True find.  But it was too good to be True.  We got there excited to try a new place and were informed that they were closing at 9... Fine, Yelp hours have been wrong before.  Then we ordered.  Per a previous yelpers suggestion I went with a small white hot chocolate, something I get often at Starbucks/Peet's/friggin every coffee shop on the planet.  The bf ordered a large tea because he likes watery leaves, fine, more power to him, give me the sugar.  And on a whim we got a tiramisu at the last minute right before she printed out the receipt.  While one barista made my cocoa, I was asked the following \"are you sure you don't want some chocolate in this, it's weird...\"  \"no, no, I just want a white hot chocolate\" I replied  After being handed my absurdly small drink I was informed that \"I tried that and it tastes really strange, you are weird.\" THANKS barista, not that I needed your super insightful comments into my drink choices, but you are free to have your opinions.    So we headed outside since they were closing to try and enjoy our snacks. Only to look at the receipt and realize that this 1 inch by 3inch tiramisu cost a whopping $6... I wish I could say that it knocked me off of my feet with its amazing flavors and depth and character.  But it was lukewarm to start (not the best beginning for any dairy based dessert) and with every bite I could just feel my super weird weirdy weirdness weirding the eff out over how angry I was at this place.  So I spent $13 for 16oz of water and a tea bag, a 6 oz cup of weird milk drink that tasted more of a bag of sugar than any kind of white chocolate, and an overpriced tiny tiramisu.    Next time you need anything coffee or pastry related, go to Sambalatte where they won't insult you or rob you blind.  Get a nutella latte and some fabulous macarons.",

Just leaving this review out there to warn people that may want to hop on by here thinking that. To save you the trouble it's a normal looking cafe inside, with the seating that looks like restaurant and the outside seating that looks like a restaurant at the strip. With restaurant food.",

The gentleman who served us our food set down a plate in front of me and told me there were no mushrooms even though there were clearly mushrooms on top and scrambled within the omelet.  I sent back the omelet and it took more than 10 minutes for them to serve me a new one.  Both omelets were huge and overcooked, the toasted sliced baguette tough and chewy, and the hashbrowns were lukewarm at best with a strange citrus flavor.  Everything was sadly underwhelming.  The only redeeming quality was the friendly manager on duty who stopped by to chat with us.  Unfortunately, we won't be dining here again.",

    "text": "Well ... the darling Orchid was shopping at Charming Charlie's here at Tivoli Village, so it was time to go get a drink and some Wi-Fi time.  So ... iced tea at Leone.  While I was killing time, my darling phoned and said she was finished.  I asked her if she was either hungry or thirsty.  (She's almost always thirsty; the medications she takes tend to dry out her mouth.)  She said she was hungry, so I went and walked her down.  (DISCLAIMER - IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE, I WILL MENTION THAT THIS WOULD BE THE SECOND TIME THAT SHE AND I HAD BEEN THERE FOR FOOD.)  The last time we ate there, she had the lasagna and I had a sandwich - which 'wich (sorry ... couldn't resist) I have forgotten.  My sandwich was as good as I expected for this price point.  Her lasagna was HUGE  I ended up with about half of it.  This time, I intended to have the lasagna.  When we arrived, we saw on the counter, just being picked up by the server, a salad of some kind with a mound of yellow something-I-couldn't-identify beside it on the plate.  Inquiry - it was a more-or-less deconstructed egg salad sandwich.  The egg salad was dished out on the plate, and the veggies that normally went into the sandwich were replaced with a small portion of their house salad mix.  (Note that this preparation is not on the menu, but of you ask really nicely - \"please, please, oh PLEEZE\" - they'll make it that way for you.)  So ... here comes the food.  My lasagna was, once again, HUGE.  A truly massive portion of meat,. cheese, eggplant with traditional noodles, having been oven-fired at some time, where the crispy-almost-burnt pasta made its appearance.  (That's one of my favorite parts, kinda like the lasagna equivalent of barbeque burnt ends.)  Orchid's egg salad \"salad\" was, to her and my taste, quite nice.  I am not a big egg salad fan, but I would order this myself.  They have unlimited iced tea refills, but they have no soda fountain, so you order soft drinks by the bottle - you want more, you pay for more ... which is about the only knock I have on the place.  The manager, a delightful fellow named Jonathan, came by a couple of times to ask how we were doing.  One of the servers, a fellow who looked to be about 22 or 23, whose name I didn't catch, also came by a couple of times to inquire, and engage in a moment or two of conversation.  Very attentive all the way around.  Orchid and I will certainly be back.  -- -- -- -- --  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: a solid 90.",

Smells like a 7-11 in Leone Cafe, not good for customers, employees, coffee or food. Unnecessary since one can use microfiber cloths and water and clean better! -* for Insanely Loud and distorted music mindlessly playing  inside cafe. It's so loud you can't hardly hear person at your table. And the choice of music is terrible. Nothing nice and subtle. -* for Fans on outdoor patio. They have 3 Small Fans installed in the ceiling in outdoor patio which are incredibly Loud! Tornado level! Be warned...  Note - The entire Tivoli Mall is now wired for outdoor sound. It is the most god-awful, loud, tasteless, mindless music you have ever heard in your life. The outdoor music is a total mismatch with the upscale mall and stores.  The only thing I can say is they are trying hard to run off what few customers they have.  TIvoli and Leone, you need quality control and managers who have experience creating an upscale atmosphere.",

    "text": "When i hand out four stars here it isn't categorically for the food and drink; i would give the consumables three and a half stars if i could. The half star bump is for having the coziest spot to swig some java. Though some of the clientele can be.. well, let's say chatty to be nice (what I'm really thinking is obnoxious), there is always ample seating inside and out. There is also something very satisfying about the lack of kitsch decor and pop music.  Expect Korean style coffee preparation though less foamy and not too hot. Cup sizes are correct (meaning a macchiato will be coming in around four ounces) with larger size options available. The drip is automatic sadly, and there could be a bit better consistency with the espresso pulls but the coffee is thankfully not Colorado River. The pastries are serviceable but can get pricey, stick to the layered cakes for best taste-to-value ratio.   Overall i recommend stopping by and sitting for a while, this is definitely more of a ceramic than paper cup locale. Just don't set your expectations up to high.",

While I would not come here for everyday coffee (prices are bit high) I love making them my stop for a snack with friends and a place to sit and talk and watch.    The apple pastry is made from phyllo-dough and if you don't know what that is you may think the pastry is dry - but it is supposed to be as it is flaky with the glaze and apples.  It's simple, not over sweet and a great match with a black coffee.  The raspberry tart is also a great small pastry.",

Pro: 1) the coffee us fresh, strong and IMO tasted really good  2) free refills on regular coffee (good buy $1.50) 3) service is great (you order at counter, pay, and the bring your order to you, and check in to see if you need anything) 4) inviting and large patio seating with misters, some tables, more in direct sunlight, have umbrellas  Not so pro: 1) I sat on the patio at a corner table and I saw a desert roach crawl near and past my table - I get that these guys hang outside for most part but, it scared the crap out of me. I noticed some dead ones by the wall so, clearly they are spraying the outdoors for them, it just wasn't ideal. 2) the panini had great flavor but got soggy quickly 3) I think the quality and quantity justify the prices, but others may find it a but pricey.",

Limited menu that never seems to change but I can always find something I like. Have had one experience with their pastries but the one I had was not the freshest. My only issue is that smoking appears to be allowed on the patio. Not much worse than diving into your breakfast and having your experience tainted by smoke.   Oh, I know it's not going to happen but I'd love it if they served beer/wine!",

Place your orders at the counter and it will be delivered to your table.  The staff was friendly and there were plenty of servers delivering food and attending to cleaning the tables. Several times we were offered refills on the coffee. There was an attentive manager making the rounds checking on customers and thanking people for there patronage as they left the cafe.  A nice customer appreciation touch.   The Southwest Wrap was delicious and plentiful. It comes with a choice of sides and I choose the mixed fruit bowl. A cup of salsa is also provided. The Southwest Breakfast Wrap contains eggs, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, roasted peppers, cheese and onion. Very tasty, especially with the salsa. Coffee was hot and tasty.  Aside from good food Leone Cafe provides ample opportunity for people watching or just enjoying the beauty of Tivoli Village. A nice place to slow down.",

I got the white pizza, probably the best dish, the classic Liege waffle, no where near classic. It was an eggo waffle at best, very disappointed to insult a Belgium waffle that way. I got the rosemary chicken panini, the chicken tasted and looked several days old, couldn't taste rosemary to save my life and it looked sad all together. The Mediterranean heaven wrap, let's jist say heaven would be upset. Lastly the caramel apple crepe, poorly made crusty crepe, apples were red, to me a caramel apple is made with granny Smith, I don't believe I even had caramel o n there come think of it. Either way spending 56 bucks on those 5 items was definitely not worth it. Maybe I caught them on an off day but I don't think myself or employees will be back to eat there.",

They also have a good outdoor seating area which is a great place for people watching especially on a weekend when they have the farmer's market or another activity at Tivoli.   Their coffee and expresso drinks are nice and strong. They cook with fresh ingredients and their portions are big enough to share. As a bonus, their service is excellent! The wait staff often come around to offer refills.  I am also a fan of the owner who appears to keep a very tight ship.  There's no slacking here!",

It wasn't the best place to meet because the music, albeit nice, was a bit loud to hear everyone as we discussed our book.  I got an iced chai tea latte that was tasty.  It could have used a bit more chai flavor.  None of us got any pastries, so I can't comment on them although they looked very nice.  I like Leone a lot.  If you're having your coffee in house, they give you a number and deliver it to your table.  I can see coming back here in the early evening, sitting on the patio, sipping a latte and people watching.  There is a lot of room at the outdoor patio.  The place could garner an extra star when I go back with a great coffee and some good pastry.  We'll see.",

There's seating inside and outside on the shaded patio to enjoy your libations while at Tivoli Village. A nice touch is by the sweeteners and creamers they keep a water vase with ice, cucumbers and lemon. I wonder how long that'll last before they take it away for all the people who will run in for a \"free\" drink and run out.   They have the usual coffee drinks hot/ice, a bit of tea drinks and smoothies. I was hot and just needed something fresh so I got a basic iced tea (large $3). It was good, but standard tea, no special flavor to it.    Other than drinks, they have some pastries, pretty desserts, sandwiches, quiches and salad. We saw a sole almond croissant ($4) so we grabbed that as our goal is to try it everywhere in the city. The BFs mom has a obsession to find this particular kind of croissant that doesn't exist but we will try anyways. It was good, but for $4 I wouldn't go for it again as there's a better croissant down the street at Manon.   The asked for my name and everyone gets Jade wrong as \"Jane\" or \"Jay\" so I always spell it out and as I do it, point to my credit cards name as I'm handing it to them. I was standing there for a while as apparently I am \"Jean/Gene\" and took a while to sort out that was me.  When the girl hands my my tea, she just walks away....where's my croissant? I ask for it so she tells a girl near the desserts to box it up for us to-go. Later they flag me down because she \"couldn't find it\". I pointed at it in the counter and she goes \"oh I thought that was a beignet\". They clearly need to iron out a bit of their service since it's new.   Not bad for a treat if you're here, but not somewhere I would specifically come here for.",

It's either powder or syrup\" next time if a worker is unsure, its ok to ask and make sure. p&t(please and thanks)  (-_- ) \"ok, can I please have a small dirty chai?\" (cause I was so tired and needing that extra kick, feel me?)  Mmmmmmmm pretty good chai! I know I'd come back for more if I was hanging out again in the village.  Wait, this doesn't taste dirty!? Thinking back at my total(my mistake), I was only charged at an amount of chai price which means no added shot of espresso. Sad. Perhaps she doesn't know what a dirty chai is. Maybe dirty water in a dirty cup?!(hope not)  Pluses: spacious cafe area, just so beautiful inside, marble floors?   Benefit of a second try,understanding that they're still new.

You can put in your order and find a place to sit down inside the cafe or outside with the refreshing mist to beat the heat.  I didn't get a chance to try their coffees, but had their iced passion tea that had the right amount of sweetness to it. Their display case is filled with tempting desserts, but look again! Be sure to ask for the price before you order, because you may be in for a pretty pastry with sticker shock. I ordered the charlot, a pastry made with ladyfingers, vanilla custard and topped with fruit, and was stunned to see it cost $5.75. I liked it, but a sandwich would get more bang for a few more dollars.  The servers check up on you from time to time after they bring out your order. They'll even ask if you'd like refills for your iced teas! Other than that, their dependable WiFi and instrumental music playing in the background create a productive environment as you work on your projects and beverages.",

This is where I took my parents for Mother's Day brunch on one of their first visits to Vegas. They were impressed!",

    "text": "Came here today for a midday coffee. I ordered a chai tea latte and lemon merengue. The place was super busy which was surprising because it was around 2 pm which is after the lunch rush. My chai latte was decent, nothing special but not bad. The lemon merengue in my opinion was pretty bad. I don't know if it had chocolate in it, but it had a flavor that did not mesh well with the lemon. I would probably not go out of my way to eat here, but it was not awful. This place is a little cafe in Tivoli Village. You order at the register and then they bring the food out to you. It was busy, but it did take quite a while to receive our very small order. After seeing this place on Dirty Dining I was hesitant to come back and so were the people in my party. I was not that impressed, so I don't see myself coming back.",

All of the workers are extremely friendly and make sure you have all you need, perfect place to sit and drink a delicious beverage and chill out.",

However, over the years I have noticed that the place is always packed and made a mental note to check it out one of these days, and today was the day! If I have to compare it to another restaurant, I would say that it is very similar to the Rachel's Kitchen category, but the bar is much higher in terms of atmosphere, food and service!  We ordered the guacamole wrap, chicken salad croissant open face sandwich and penne pomodoro (pasta). Everything was fresh and delicious!  They also have a coffee bar, smoothies, fresh juices and dessert & pastries! I can't wait to go back again!",

My most recent visit was with my son and we were able to snag a table for two on a Friday afternoon when seating inside was scarce.  Leone also has a spacious patio but it was too cold on that day.  Kiddo had his standard chai latte and I had an almond latte.  We sat there for almost two hours enjoying our drinks and conversation.  A couple of employees checked on us during that time to see if we needed anything, but did not intrude or rush us out even though we drank our lattes in the first half hour.  I haven't really eaten here, but they do have pastries, sandwiches, and salads that look good whenever I've seen them pass by on their way to other customers.  This is a good place to hang out with others, have a drink or meal, and people watch.",

To kick off my experience, the wait in line to order was fine however, the cashier taking my order was not so friendly and took 3 phone orders right in front of me before taking my order.  I Ordered 3 meals for my group with 1 being an omelet. I requested \"No Tomatoes\" and guess what....... Omelet came loaded with tomatoes  It's also pretty gross when your bowl of fruit comes with Mold on the blackberries  And to top it off..... The Smoky Eggs dish contains salmon which is 1 of the reasons I ordered it only thing is, it lacks flavor other than the salmon having a very strong fishy taste. I've ordered this type of dish at many other cafes and this one was not good at all. Caution: they also go very heavy on the onions underneath the salmon and greans.  The reason for 2 stars and not 1.... Hot tea comes in a very generous amount and the pastries are actually pretty yummy. I've walked by this place on many occasions and next time..... I'll just keep walking.",

    "text": "Located in the whimsical Tivoli Village, this beautiful cafe is the picturesque place to sip drinks, grab a light bite (salads, sandwiches, sweet treats), and people watch.   A beautiful place such as Leone Cafe should have amazing drink concoctions crafted by skilled baristas, right? I'm still on the fence about this. I ordered a Chai Tea Latte, which was too sweet. I even thought about adding more milk to it to dilute it, but alas, no non-fat milk on the counter (only half & half and 2%). It needed more spice, not more sugar/syrup. Next time, I'll ask them to cut back on the sweet.   The pastries behind the glass display looked delightfully delicious, and I was tempted to try one. Maybe next time.",

They have a great selection of loose leaf teas, including a white and greens, and if you're sipping there, it is served in a tall French press, which means you get enough tea for two for a little over $3. (The only slightly bad thing about serving tea in a French press is that it is prone to over steeping.) Thanks to all this it has become my go-to spot for a change of scenery and meetings over steaming beverages.",

We also had an apricot pastry...again delish.  When we went in the first thing I noticed was how nice the decor is...really keeps with the feel of Tivoli Village.  Everything in the pastry case looked good...fresh and beautifully displayed.   My only criticism...we were the only ones at the counter checking out the menu.  Instead of the staff just staring at us, it would have been nice to have been acknowledged and asked if they could answer any of our questions. Will that keep me away?  No, we're already planning our next visit.",

There is free wifi and plenty of room to sit outside. The seating area is mostly covered, so you can stay out of the sun which is nice.  The pastry is also about average as well.   There's nothing that distinguishes Cafe Leone except the comfortable, ample seating outside and that's enough for me to frequent the place.  Bottom line - coffee is a 2 and atmosphere is a 4. Average 3.",

I don't like when you have to have one person find seating while the other stands in line. Reminds me of home town buffet, and man I hated that place in California.  You cant see any menus really posted until you get to the front when your supposed to order and I felt rushed. No child friendly options on the menu, nor did I see a child's menu. A little pricey than I expected based on the fact it's a breakfast/lunch place where there's limited options. No refills on drinks? Never had that experience elsewhere. No bathroom?! Had to leave and walk my daughter to another street to get to one. Very unconventional.   What I did like was that it was pretty good sized portions. I wouldn't say it was huge. The restaurant is cute and quaint looking. The turkey bacon wrap was good and the honey mustard sauce was delicious. More turkey than I was expecting since most places like to skimp on the meat. It was nice to see them offer cucumber water on the side. My daughter didn't like her waffle because she said it was too hard. But on the other hand she loved that it was served with a side of Nutella and raspberry sauce, which she called jam.   I think next time I would rather go next door to brio, since in the end it cost the same, I wouldn't have to fight for a seat, have a bathroom and free refills.",

It feels like a real cafe: inviting furniture, the robust aroma of coffee beans, the wizzing, hissing, and grinding of various cafe machinery. It's a beautiful thing. Really great place to hang out or take a break from shopping.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I've gotten the Nutella Cappuccino twice and the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well. I love the real mugs and the foam art. Plus, both drinks were tasty. Delicious coffee + cool cafe = wonderful experience.  I was told that Leone Cafe served pastries from Patisserie Manon, which came highly recommended, so I was excited to check out their case. I tried the Fraisier (French cake filled with strawberries and creme patissiere) during my first visit and it was so heavenly! Very delicate cake with delicious cream and strawberries.   In December, the selection was not as nice. Actually, the quality seemed significantly lower. The \"fresh\" fruit topping the cakes were disgusting. It was obviously old and shouldn't have been in the case nor on sale. The pastries didn't seem to be of the same caliber as Patisserie Manon. Anyway, after terrible communication, obvious lack of focus, and substandard customer service from the 2-3 employees behind the counter, we chose the Chocolate Strawberry Cake and Carrot Cake along with our coffees. Both were dry and just bad.  I'm giving them three stars because as a coffee shop, it's really great. Just avoid the pastries!",

I had a custom omelette with egg whites, red pepper, tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, and feta - mouth watering! I saw several items on the menu I would return for too. I sat on the patio but still received impeccable service. No one hovered, but I always had a full mug of coffee, and everyone was polite and friendly. I could most definitely suggest Leone to others!",

Even the $4.00 cappuccino was so good that it justified the money. I ordered the chicken caprese salad which was okay, but the pizza and some other menu items look promising.  The service is remarkable as servers constantly walk around the indoor and outdoor seating areas to check up on you, refill drinks, etc. I recommend the outdoor seating area if it isn't too hot outside. Even on a June day when the temperature was a little over 100 degrees, the misters and fans make the dining experience comfortable.  Would definitely come back again.",

The smoothies are good I hear (they look good too) and when you order for dine in they have adorably dressed service persons deliver the food and coffee to your table.

    "text": "After feasting with a g.f. at PF Chang's for dinner, down the street, she enthusiastically declared she wanted to check out Leone Cafe (I wish she would've told me that before I drank 3 iced teas! But I was willing to risk heart palpitations & a sleepless nite.). We got there just before 9p & there was pretty impressive occupancy. While there were patrons inside, the obvious draw was the outdoor seating. & that was precisely OUR plan! In retrospect, I wish I would've gotten the name of the girl who helped us order because she deserved a shout-out. My g.f. got the same iced vanilla latte she would order anywhere while I asked some questions about familiar items. Our order taker patiently & sincerely answered my questions & gave me input. She talked me into trying (what I believe is) their signature drink: a latte (iced, in my case) with cinnamon & honey that she assured me was neither too cinnamon'y nor too honey'y (& told me if I didn't like it, she'd personally buy me a new drink). We then picked a table outside & waited for our drinks. That were delivered to us. In real glasses. By our order taker so she could ensure satisfaction. My latte had great flavor, I'd definitely order it again; however, it really isn't sweet so I'll ask for a tad vanilla. My g.f.'s vanilla latte (which I'm typically not a fan of) was very delicious. The vanilla actually tasted vanilla'y, not like high fructose corn syrup or chemically. & the latte was robust enough to handle that vanilla. I'm no coffee snob but I know this much: we got 5-star service, the outdoor seating was lovely (minus the wretched 'singing' coming from the stage nearby), the drinks were good & the people-watching was great!",

I love sitting outside where I can enjoy Las Vegas's version of a little Italy. The servers are extremely nice and welcoming and even attend to you at your table although its pretty much seat your self etc.   I had a bagel lox and it was delicious, they don't hold back on their portions too so that's a plus. Although the food is a little pricey for a cafe, i don't mind at all since the service and the ambiance is remarkable .   Its located in tivoli village and when i came there was a farmers market going on lining the streets which gave it a little more uniqueness compared to the rest of Vegas.   I did not get to try the desserts which is partly why i went there but I will definitely be coming back :)",

Quite a few of my friends love coming here and while it's an overall nice idea, I would honestly rather go anywhere else.   The concept for this spot is to order at the register, pay, the cashier gives you a number, and they bring your order to you. This isn't an uncommon practice for restaurants but Leone Cafe makes it so difficult for guests. It's not easy to get from either entrances to the the register, the line is awkwardly formed because people are trying to get out of the waiters way while also looking at the treats, and once you get to the counter the staff is actually quite rude and rush you to decide. I asked what kind of hot teas they had and it was quite comical how annoyed the cashier was to answer my question. After placing my order I made a bee line for a table outside and waited for my items.   I ordered a chocolate mousse cake and an English Breakfast tea which came in a french press. The cake was very rich and although I enjoyed it, it was entirely too sweet and I could only finish half. The tea, however, was terrible. I don't like giving bad reviews as I know this is people's livelihood but... this tea....tasted like what I suspect the water to taste like after a dog bath. It was terrible!",

Very fancy if you ask me, and it is surrounded by a town like scenery! One could even say it is in the heart of Tivoli Village.   Honestly whenever I am here I try to sit next to the window because I feel like I'm in a town! At night this cafe is gorgeous! They even have outside seating!  Me personally I would give this cafe a very \"mature\" atmosphere. A lot of adults, people in suits and ties, and older folk seem to gather here. Unlike other cafes, you don't see many teenagers here. This place is also family orientated which I love.   Inside it isn't too loud but the noise level isn't too high.  My buddy and I ordered the Nutella cappuccino and the Cafe white chocolate latte. Being a Barista you can definately taste the coffee that goes into these beverages!  We had to pair our coffee with some desserts so we ordered a Tiramisu cake and a chocolate mousse! Both delicious!  I have no doubt in my mind that I will return!",

We've been here several times and I have to say that this place always amazes us every time we come here. Everyone is super friendly and attentive with checking on us to refill our drinks or see if we need anything else. We even love how the manager takes the time to stop by each table to ask if everything is ok.   As for their food, my boyfriend and I always come here for brunch. On a nice sunny day, we love to relax in their outdoor seated area to soak up the sunshine. I love ordering the open face breakfast bagel with a salad and my boyfriend loves getting the egg salad sandwich. It still surprises us how huge the portions are.   Today, my boyfriend ordered an omelette this time that came with an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and he loved it. Because I'm a such huge coffee drinker, my go to drink is the Nutella cappuccino and I absolutely love it. Although we were full, it didn't stop us from getting a few pastries to go.   I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area. You won't regret it.",

I'm so glad I live close by now! My only complaint is I wish they can add soup to their menu. I was craving a small bite with soup but they have everything else BUT that.

    "text": "Although Tivoli is a ghost town due to its location, they have a considerable amount of great dining options. Leone happens to be the place that I visit the most often.   There is never a time when the outdoor seating isn't packed - it can be a freezing winter night or a sweltering summer  morning and people will still be lounging at tables.  The drink choices are great and are still cheaper than Starbucks. I highly recommend the chai latte. The entree choices are quite substantial - any of the salads are quite filling. The desserts are so rich and generous, it's definitely something you should share.  While busy, I enjoy that there are fewer people using this place as a mobile office for hours on end while nursing a short coffee like at chain coffee shops. Luckily there are ample tables, so the few customers who are tacky enough to be running HR duties across multiple tables won't take up the whole place.  I highly recommend this place not just because of the great food and drinks, but because it feels like you aren't in Vegas for a moment.",

    "text": "I met with some friends here at Leone Cafe located in Tivoli Village for breakfast. There's seating inside as well outside on a large patio. It's a good thing they have plenty of tables/chairs because this place is popular and there was lots of heads inside and out. You place your order at the register and they give you a number to place on your table so they know where to bring the order. The wait wasn't too bad for our food and drinks given how busy they were. Staff was very friendly and good about going around to check on customers.   Nutella Latte ($4.75 for a large) - I did enjoy this drink, but didn't love it. I did try some of my friends iced chai and it was much better. The latte art was cute and the price was fair.   Banana Nutella Crepe ($8.50) - I loved the taste of this crepe. There was a fair amount of nutella and bananas inside the crepe as well outside of it. Worth every penny.   Chocolate Cake ($5.99) - I got chocolate wasted on this one lol. Really good, but also rich. Thankfully this was a shared dessert because I wouldn't have been able to finish it. They have a lot of delicious looking desserts in the case that I'd like to come back and try. Since they take to-go orders here it's worth stopping by even if just to grab something sweet for later.  Aside from crepes they also offer breakfast sandwiches, waffles, omelets, pasta, salads, wraps and both cold sandwiches and hot sandwiches. When it comes to drinks they have a good selections of hot and iced coffees, fresh juices and fruit smoothies.",

The best part is the manager. I had a Greek Salad ( which was great) with a little too much dressing. When the manager checked on us as he was with many tables I just mentioned next time I would order it on the side... he insisted on getting me another one. I didn't want to trouble them but he wanted it to be perfect! He brought a new one and later made us try a pastry on the house. I loved how he cared so much to make sure we liked what we ordered and came back to sincerely check on us. Would come back again and again! Service is fabulous!!! Thanks for a great meal!!!",

Ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and an Iced Mocha at the counter, then went outside. Didn't have a problem finding a table in the shade. The salad was pretty good and the mocha was tasty! The one thing that stood out for me was that the staff was very friendly, and they all seemed to love dogs. My husky was showered with love and attention from the staff and customers. The staff always flashed him a genuine smile whenever they would pass our table. It's one thing to allow dogs, but to have employees that seem to genuinely like them is another. I plan on being a regular, and I'm sure I will learn some of their names so I can compliment them properly.",

It's located inside Tivoli Village and is the perfect place to sit outside, sip a cup of coffee and people watch.There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.   I went for breakfast and ordered the House Breakfast, which was great! It's an omelet with turkey bacon, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and cheese. It also comes with hash browns and toasted bread.  The staff was very attentive. The waiters checked on us multiple times, but it did take awhile for our food and drinks to come out which was a little frustrating.   Other than that I highly recommend going here! I went two days in a row because I love the ambiance and location of this restaurant. Parking is a breeze as well. There's an underground parking garage, street parking, and valet. Plenty of options!   Oh and they serve bottomless mimosas!! I haven't gone for drinks yet, but I'll definitely have to try soon!",

    "text": "After a friend vehemently raved about Leone Cafe, I knew I had to try it. My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Wednesday morning about 8AM. It was right upstairs from the parking garage in a cute, European-style cafe. You order your food from the cashiers, and they bring it to you at your table. There is both outside and inside seating. On this cold morning, we opted for inside. The ambiance and aesthetics were great. Loved it, especially since I am NOT a morning person.   Anyway, so we ordered a few things.   I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, which the cashier recommended. It came with two hefty-sized pesto breads. Those were delicious. The pasta, itself, was lacking some flavor, but it was good overall. The portion was a good amount.   My boyfriend ordered the Panini Breakfast Muffin. He said it was only okay. It came with a bowl of fruit, which was fresh.   He also ordered the chocolate cake, which was very good. It was extremely soft and moist. I have to say that this was the best thing that we had!   I also ordered a orange mimosa. It was a bit sour for my taste, but still good. I don't think I would order it again though. It was $8 for a medium-sized flute. I should have probably opted for the $16 bottomless mimosa option, but I wasn't trying to get too crazy on a Wednesday morning.  The service was good. The staff seemed very friendly and willing to help us with our order. Since we were first-time guests, we had no idea what to try. The menu is pretty extensive, and it definitely all sounded worthy of trying.   Overall, the food was good. The ambiance was very pleasing. It was a bit on the expensive side for breakfast, and the food wasn't outstanding. But, since it is up the road from my house, I think I will come back.",

Ive has the breakfast croissant; wrap on fire; some plain egg whites. All very tasty. On the lunch side I would recommend the streak sandwich! It is delicious. The chimichurri sauce is on point PS it's also on the wrap on fire.",

Go up to the counter, order, take your number and seat yourself.   Food and drinks came out promptly. We ordered an iced mocha and chai latte which were both delicious. As for the food, we got an avocado toast with egg ($10.99 without egg. +$2 with.) and a tuna melt ($9.50). The avocado toast was piled high with so much unnecessary greens. It was extremely difficult to eat. The balance between toast and avocado was way off that it just became a soggy mess.  It didn't help that I got an over easy egg on top. The tuna melt was.... different. It had some kind of spice that one would normally not expect in a tuna melt. It also had corn in it. My partner was only able to take one bite before putting it down.   Service was good in the beginning but after checking on us once, it was difficult to get someones attention.   I give this place a solid 3 stars. I would come back here for drinks but not the food.",

My family and friends also tested a wide variety of entrees and agreed that the place is definitely a place to add to your breakfast/brunch staples. Both parties even rave about how something like orange juice can taste SO good. Overall, the food is great, the prices are affordable, and the ambience is very laid back as it should be.",

The way they cook the chicken is so amazing.   Beyond the food, the atmosphere and ambiance is perfect. I come here for lunch during the week, but it is also great for the weekend. They have nice patio seating with a great view of the beautiful Tivoli Village.",

It wasn't too busy when we first arrived, but as it drew closer to lunchtime the tables began to fill; everyone seems to take their lunch break here, and I can see why!   You order and pay at the counter and then are given a number card to put at your chosen table. The cashiers and servers were all very pleasant and didn't rush me while I was deciding what to eat. They have an extensive menu here that includes handcrafted espresso drinks, bakery items, and breakfast/lunch/dinner options. I went with a small latte and the caprese panini, with a fruit tart for dessert. The total for two meals with coffee and dessert came out to about $40, which is really not bad for all that deliciousness. Everything looks fancy here but don't let that intimidate you- the food is great and portions are generous. We walked away happy.   Come to Leone Cafe if you want to treat yourself to a warm atmosphere and yummy treats!",

    "text": "4 stars for yummy food and drinks... Knocked down to 3 for service.  The siblings and I originally wanted to go on a coffee adventure, but decided to incorporate food, so we Yelped this place out. Of course it was our first time at the establishment, thus making it an adventure.  Was definitely crowded by the time we got there around 10:30-11AM on a Saturday morning. Kinda chilly outside, but we had no choice since the restaurant's indoor area was full. No biggie. I realize what time of day we were going, but... Going inside, we weren't greeted or acknowledged until my sister said she was ready and went straight for the cashier to start placing an order. We were kinda flustered - took us a good minute to find the laminated food menu, separate from coffee menu up top, thinking all they had were displayed breakfast pastries. Not to mention that by the time we all ordered on 1 bill, the cashier was pretty... Eh. LOL. Seriously? What happened to the smile and chit chat you were having with everyone else working behind the counter? You wait to stop the chatting once customers get up there? I also realize it was cold out, but with that amount of workers behind the counter, no one really checked on outdoor patrons? There were about 2-3 other tables that were occupied with ours. We only got checked on once aside from bringing out the food and drinks, then taking our plates away in 2 trips. Anyway... We enjoyed our drinks. Had the flavors we were looking for. The food was fulfilling and fresh. The sister had a Scone and Banana Nutella Crepe, brother-in-law and brother had the Leone Breakfast Croissant, and I had the Southwest Breakfast Wrap. Only criticism my family had was that the Scone was a bit dry. So yeah... Food was good.  Would it be a place we'd like to go to more often? Not really. Maybe if a food craving drove us there. That or relatives living on that side wanted to go. Sorry, but this place gave us a silly first impression, especially since outdoor elements already made us slightly uncomfortable that service could've made up for. If my siblings aren't happy, I'm honestly going to be more displeased. That's putting this all mildly.",

The service is great with servers running around refilling coffee cups, clearing empty plates, making sure that we were happy. I shared the Meditteran breakfast , lush with feta, spinach, and lots of eggs. A wonderful little tomato cucumber salad accompanied it along with salty olives, tuna salad and some bread n cream cheese. Fabulous!  I loved the coffee too. Just coffee for me and it was so smooth I just had to have another cup.  A bonus for Saturday's is the farmer's market! Fun!

My thought is \"how can they be out of croissants they are a French Cafe after all\"!! In short the chicken salad fell out of the focaccia bread and just made a mess.  I won't accept the waiters suggestion next time, as I know my palate....",

There is plentiful seating indoors and outdoors - but the place is busy and seats may be hard to come by.  I recognize the wait staff from when they opened years ago. They are nice and efficient.  Very little beats institutional knowledge.  I don't eat eggs, so my food experience is limited here. My wife has very much enjoyed the quality of the wraps.  The berry salad is excellent - you can see it in the glass display case before you buy it to judge for yourself.  I like the Leone especiale latte. Like a Mexican spicy latte.",

I had the Italian omelette, which came with bread, a fruit bowl, and your choice of juice ($11.25) as well as a latte. The omelette was AMAZING- seriously one of the best I've had. Packed with chicken, cheeses, mushrooms, spinach, it was flavorful and fresh, and perfectly cooked. The bread was rather forgettable (I have a particular aversion to crunchy bread), but the orange juice!!!! I know, it is just OJ, but this orange juice was AMAZING!! Just delicious- I could seriously drink it all day long! The latte was also very good, strong and flavorful, and of course with a fancy design in the foam.  This place is very popular, so of course it gets crowded and you may have a bit of a wait for a table, especially on a nice day. There is outside seating, and both the inside and outside is lovely. My only complaint is that it is a bit of a trek to the nearest restroom, but that's not really the fault of the restaurant.   I will definitely return, and hope to be able to sample some of the yummy looking desserts, too!",

Once in a GREAT while there's free time and I can order a coffee and SIT DOWN.  I had 20 minutes of poorly planned down time to kill and I figured- today is the day. I sit down and have coffee from a normal ceramic mug. Like people in movies do.  Cafe Leone is just the place to do that- when you order coffee at the counter, you can chose \"for here\" option and your beverage gets delivered to your table. Then attentive staff that stands by whisks your empty mug away.  I'm smitten. The service, the attention and glorious pastry case- what's not to love.  I ordered vanilla soy chai latte and drank it staring out the window, wondering when will be the next time I get to sit and breathe.   Thanks for a lovely break, Cafe Leone!",

So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, Leone Cafe is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Tivoli Village, West side of Las Vegas. Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from. After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses. Pretty easy process! I visited Leone Cafe twice last week, while I was doing business in Tivoli Village. Both times I ordered Hazelnut Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Croissant (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled Salmon Salad.  According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either. I absolutely loved the cappuccino and the croissant!  I'm sure I will be back to try other items from the menu! And of course to enjoy the amazing coffee again!",

I usually opt for something savory when it comes to breakfast and have yet to be disappointed by their omelettes, which are easily customizable. Also guilty of ordering the California Turkey Sandwich with extra romaine / without bread on multiple occasions without any trouble.

I've also tried the steak guacamole wrap and chicken caprese panini, both of which were fantastic. I never have room for dessert but they do have a large assortment of different pastries and goodies. Perhaps I'll get some to go next time. No trip to Tivoli Village is complete without a visit to Leone Cafe!",

I am very picky about my coffee  I am not a fan of Starbucks coffee as I feel it lacks a coffee taste and is just overpriced milk.  I've also tried Sambalatte and thought it was okay.  It wasn't as bad as Starbucks, but it wasn't the perfection that Leone Cafe is. This tastes like a True Italian coffee.    I usually have the Mocha here.  It is sweet, without being too sweet, and where you still have the rich Italian espresso flavor.  I recently had a friend in town and we needed to kill some time.  I brought him here without saying anything about the place or my opinion of it.  He ordered the white mocha and said it was the best he's ever had!!  As for a sweet treat, please try the cannoli crepe.  It's big enough to share and will have you addicted after the first bite!!  The food portions are very generous here.  My Mom and I wanted a light fare and split the Champagne Chicken Berries Salad.  (I'll include the picture below.  The picture is actually the half order since we split it).  The staff and service here are amazing.  They are so attentive.  I told the cashier we were splitting it and they didn't just bring an empty plate, as most other places do. They perfectly prepared each plate for us.    If you're in the mood for breakfast, I can't say enough about their dishes.  Each time you try something new, it immediately becomes your favorite.  I LOVE the Mediterranean omelet. It's made with spinach, mushrooms and feta cheese.  It also comes with additional salads (that are soooo good) and an orange juice.  This is the best omelet I've ever had.  It's made to perfection and is so fresh.    Lastly, (yes, I'm here at least a couple times a week) so I have a lot to say....this place is soooo clean!!  I came in one time right before they were closing.  I took my decaf coffee in a to go cup and sat outside.  I was able to see their cleaning process.  WOW!!  I've never seen such a thorough cleaning.  They moved all the tables and didn't just sweep or mop.  They had a deep cleaning, commercial machine with rotating bristles to clean the floors.  You could tell the crew was used to doing it, as each one knew the area and role they had to complete.  It wasn't just the floors, but I saw them thoroughly clean every nook and cranny.  I was really impressed.    If you come here on a weekend, know that it'll probably be packed....but it's sooooooo worth it!!",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in the Greek salad, I didn't even eat more than a few bites. To say the dressing saturated it, would be an understatement. Also, someone went way to crazy on the olives. After eating some, I counted 25 more whole Greek olives. Between that and the soppy lettuce, I was bummed. Waste of money this time. The only reason that I have it more than 1 star, is for their amazing cappuccinos.",

We opted for the Tiramisu, chocolate macaroon, and chocolated eclair.  All were really yummy and tasted fresh.  Nice friendly staff, and great seating in the outdoor area.  It has been really hot lately but they have misters outside.  There is a server that walks around the patio/piazza area that  checks on everyone.  She even surprised me by asking if I wanted my empty cup filled with black coffee after I had finished my almond milk capuccino.   She literally went back inside and grabbed a pot of coffee and refilled my cup for no charge.  This was a nice random gesture that I've never seen anywhere.  Anyway, i always have a a great time with the kids in Tivoli Village and this cafe is an added piece of heaven especially if you are a java junkie like me.",

I was hoping to be able to come and enjoy the surroundings on nights I wish to drink coffee.  I ordered a breve. The coffee had a very odd burnt/chemical taste. It was stingy and astringent, which are two words I have never used to describe coffee.  The employees are friendly, but do not expect any latte art. They do not really seem to be especially passionate, or at least, well trained in coffee prep. This shop seems to rely on the aesthetics of an upscale coffee shop (aprons and flat caps, traditional menu, classy dishware), lacking decent coffee. I couldn't even finish mine.",

I err on the tall side and I still felt like I was unable to eat off the table from the low booth. It felt like I needed a booster seat sitting in that thing.  Anyway, lets talk food and drinks.  I took it upon myself to order a strawberry and banana protein shake w/ vegan protein.  It was borderline too sweet.  That made me worry about the health factor since it was supposed to be all natural.  So that was a little disappointing. I have also tried their green tea smoothie and the same thing... too sweet.  Lemonade is delish and of course, sweet! The only thing unsweet was the passion fruit iced tea.  Go figure.  I have yet to bring myself to eat a quiche or fruit tarte since it all looks very commercial and mass produced in its glorified glass case.I'll save that for an update.",

As far as the food I had a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta bread w turkey bacon , eggs, three cheeses and tomatoes. Great stuff ! Coffee on the other hand was so so. Had the iced coffee so how can you screw that up? This place did . Having worked at Starbucks for 5 years I may be spoiled. But the coffee tasted burnt and as if they used tap water. Unfiltered water makes the coffee taste horrible . And that's what I tasted.   Other than that it was an enjoyable experience and I will come here for the food and a soda.",

You soon find out that Leone Cafe operates under a different protocol - you order first and then you find your own seats.  On Mother's day, it's a potential mess, but we were able to get it all done swiftly.  Once that happened, you realize that this restaurant is stocked floor to ceiling with young, attractive staff; it's nice to see young people being so productive!  We ordered a bunch of dishes and for the most part, the food was satisfactory (they could make a better steak sandwich, to be honest), but the killjoy was the stray thin strand of hair on one of the plates.  We moved forward like champs, but it's worth mentioning because young people need to pay attention to detail - it's the difference between an average dining experience and an extraordinary one! Good coffee, though!",

    "text": "How do you make a non-aerodynamic location, without flight attendants or pilots smell like an airplane? Simple: 1 part new building smell, 1 part central air-conditioning, 2 parts roasted coffee beans, and voila! Instant airplane smell!  Like most new places in Vegas, this place looks really nice, but the setup is a bit strange. It feels like I am in a train station or airport terminal. Again, this may just be because it smelled like an airplane and my mind just drifted to those associated memories, but the mind is a funny thing.   I digress.   The reason I am giving this place 4 stars, and it's a big reason is: The opera cake is delicious. I've had opera cakes before, but this one takes the cake (pun fully intended). In the words of the barista that recommended this selection, \"It will change your life.\" I don't know if I would go so far as to say that I left with two stone tablets and 10 commandments to share with the chosen people (read: facebook), but I definitely left with a happy tummy and warm memories of ganache spread across layers of chocolate mousse and fluffy chocolate pastry. It is definitely worth ordering, especially if you love chocolate. Definitely not airplane food.  And with that, you are now free to move about the cabin.",
