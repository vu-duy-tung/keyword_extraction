    "text": "Looking for a late night dinner me and a buddy find Satay Thai. Highly rated and located near the strip we give it a shot.  The service was the highlight of the experience. We were greeted as we walked in and the servers were very attentive and friendly.  For an appetizer we ordered the Bacon wrapped Scallops & my entree was Mongolian Chicken Curry. The food was mediocre as a whole. The bacon scallops came 2 on each skewer and there were 6 total for $9. The bacon wasn't cooked enough in my opinion and the scallops were small and definitely frozen.  My curry was kind of the same story. For Thai, I felt it was a bit bland and didn't have much of a strong curry flavor even though it looked and had the consistency of a typical thai curry dish.  Neither of these dishs were good enough for me to order again, so I won't be coming back.  I don't like reviewing a place after 1 visit, but as my friend said 'you had one try to impress me.' As I said the service here was good, the inside is clean but the decorations seem to not really match. It was pretty dead & the bar was empty especially for a Friday night.  Not too surprised though when I have been to plenty of places that serve better Thai food.",

Nasi lemak came with chicken curry, taste authentic while being not spicy even for Americans here. Hainan chicken rice is an ok, preferred Penang Malaysian Restaurant better though.  The decor is nice with a decent bar for those who likes to sit on the bench.",

We were looking for a somewhat quiet setting (often difficult to find just off the Las Vegas strip at 11pm on a Friday night!)  Greeted immediately upon entry, and seated right away.  The music was perfectly volumed, and our server Louis was on the ball!!  Louis kept our drinks full, and consistently replaced my icy beer mug with each bottle of beer.    We ordered these calamari Satay skewers for an app... so fresh I could taste the wood-char on the meat.  The skewers came with a flavorful (and rather spicy-hot) dipping sauce.. absolutely perfect!  Soups... right up there with the best.  Hot and fresh.  The only thing I would have changed about the Tom Ka soup is the type of mushroom and adding a little more spice (red chili paste).  Since Tom Ka soup is varied so much by chef taste and region, my personal preferences did not hold back my star rating here.  Our entrees (served at 11:30pm) were piping hot and deliciously fresh!    I can't say enough about our server Louis and the unusual superior service so late at night! BRAVO!!!!!!",

The place is packed with people people who needed a good meal after CES. We were seated by an extremely kind hostess who was very personable and warned that it would take a bit to get our food but assured someone would be at our tables soon. Our waiter came in no time to take our order. We started off with curry samosas (YASSSS) which came with a good portion. For our entrees we ordered pad Thai with chicken and a panang curry with chicken. I will say the pad Thai was lacking spiciness (I ordered a spicy lvl 5) but my problem was resolved by adding some chilies to it. Both dishes were cooked very well and packed with lots of flavor. I also tried the Thai tea which had the perfect amount of sweetness and not too sweet like I find most Thai teas to be. Our waiter was amazing! With a fully packed restaurant, he was able to keep our glasses full of water and make sure we were doing good while dealing with multiple tables and running around. A+ for the service. The receipt says \"server: M\" which makes it hard to give you a shout out but Mr. M if you're reading this; THANK YOU! :)",

They don't have any kind of curry or pad-thai that they are able/willing to prepare vegan. The vegan options were just really boring sounding vegetable dishes. I went with the best sounding option they had which was the Rad Na, large flat noodles with vegetables. It didn't seem like it was going to be very exciting and it really wasn't. It didn't have any special flavor; however, it was very salty. I didn't even finish it, which is rare, because I'm a big eater who generally finishes things, especially when it's Thai food. They do have vegan dessert- sorbet, so that's a plus, not that it was amazing. All in all, this place is really mediocre for vegans.",

    "text": "This is a \"fusion\" restaurant, so the people looking for a completely authentic meal will be disappointed. That said, the flavors aren't bad here.   I had the roti canai, steak & chicken satay, and the curry laksa. The roti canai was the most disappointing. It is basically identical to the frozen canai/pratha that you can buy from many Asian supermarkets. However, the accompanyin curry was quite good, which redeems it a little.   The satay was the opposite; the peanut sauce was disappointing (too thick and too sweet), but the meat was quite good. The satay here has that charred flavor that is unique to satay. However, the chicken satay could have used more seasoning, the flavor was definitely on the weak side. Another thing they could do to improve the satay is to use less meat on each skewer and increase the number of skewers in each serving. I bet if they cooked it that way, the flavor of each skewer will improve significantly.   The curry laksa was also decent. Instead of my preferred choice of short thick rice noodles, they serve the laksa with vermicilli (bee hoon) and egg noodles. My least favorite part was the slices of chicken breast that were in the noodle; they were just very bland. The fish balls were decent, though I'm more familiar with fish cakes in laksa. The fried tofu was the best part of the dish.  Overall, the flavors here are pretty good, just don't expect a completely authentic dining experience.",

Both were delicious, and the peanut sauce they include is terrific.  Lumpia egg rolls were quite tasty.  Wasn't too crazy about the Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), but I think that was just a matter of personal preference, not poor preparation.   For main course, we split the Panang Curry with Pork.  It was PERFECT.  Sauce was perfect consistency and well spiced.  Quite excellent.    Can't wait to go back.",

Satay is a pretty trendy spot, it seems that it'd be a fun place to enjoy the night close to the Strip if you want to drink and eat on the cheap. intimate lighting, lots of bar space, cool decor, and their food is tasty and authentic, not some type of Americanized version of thai food!  -civilities.",

Luckily for us, Satay has a \"Small Plates\" menu that allowed us to still have the tapas experience without waiting an hour!  So after a little misunderstanding about seating our large party (13), the service was fast and friendly, the ambiance was cozily upscale, and the food was great!  Also, the menu is a pretty nice size, so unless you've got a VERY picky/allergy-prone person in your party, there will be something for everyone  :-)    Dishes I tried:  Thai Tea:  Yummmm!!  *drools*    Crab Rangoons:  Delicious, had a very rich/heavy cream cheese concoction that had an extra spice/flavoring or two that isn't normal for a run of the mill crab rangoon!    Mango Ceviche Nachos:  Interesting flavor profile (a fruit based ceviche sounded so interesting), crunchy texture of the chip (more of a puffed rice/grain) helped to pull the dish together.  Light, crunchy and fresh!  Tom Kha soup: Simple, fresh, light, delicious!  I added a couple spoonfuls of red curry to make it more of a Tom Kai Gai type soup!    Red Curry (NOT Panang): Delicious!  Heavy, rich sauce (which is usual), yummy bellpeppers,choice of jasmine, brown or coconut rice!   Though I didn't try anything else due to being full enough to BUST, everyone else was very pleased with their choices!  Also they have a great beer, alcohol and wine selection..and though we did not go during happy hour, the menu (for happy hour) looked GREAT!!",

The Crab Rangoon was alright and arrived quickly. I usually order Pad Thai and decided to try the Pad See Ew instead. It was good but I think I was looking for a different flavor.   The second night I ordered the Pad Thai. It's a solid sized portion and full of flavor. A nice version of a classic dish.  Service at Satay is friendly and fast.

We keep going back for several reasons: 1.) the restaurant is very comfortable and inviting, good for casual meals or for a more romantic evening    2.) we have always had really good service both for dining in and for takeout    3.) the food has been delicious. Every time.   Another plus here is that for anyone with gluten intolerance/Celiac concerns (like me), they are careful to note on the menu what is GF and they have been more than gracious to answer questions about the menu and preparation methods should you need to know more. I have eaten here many times and have never encountered a gluten issue.   After trying other Thai restaurants in the city we keep going back to Satay Thai. The food is absolutely wonderful and we have had consistent good service. This is our favorite Thai spot in Las Vegas. We've frequented for two years now and always look forward to our visits.",

    "text": "So my family doesn't really celebrate christmas other than making sure that we are all together doing something on the day. Christmas dinner is usually a pain in the ass and requires lots of calling around to see what poor people are working on christmas. Usually we get Chinese or pizza but since we were in vegas we decided to call a few more places than we normally do.   Satay happened to be open and allowed us to reserve a seat. The waitress was the best and funny and engaging. We got: chicken breast pad thai, pork pad see ew, chicken satay, half a roasted duck, and thai basil beef.   Chicken Satay- the whole family loves peanut sauce so the thing was gone in seconds. The portion was a little small though for the price.   Chicken pad thai- the best dish we ordered. It was just the perfect amount of everything. They use these huge bowls that make it look like there isn't much food but it's more than enough. My dad who doesn't usually like pad thai ended up really digging the dish.   Pork pad see ew- this was yummy as well and i'm glad I was able to convince my mom to get it. I'm glad it wasn't my main dish though since I don't like chinese broccoli  Half a roasted duck- huge portion for just $15! I don't like duck but my sister really enjoyed it. The coconut flavored jasmine rice that came with it was pretty good as well.   Thai basil beef- this was the most disappointing dish. We had pretty high hopes for it but there just wasn't enough umph to it.  It was just salty and the taste of the basil didn't come through.   For desert we got mango sticky rice because both my sister and mom had never had it before. The coconut sauce they used was a little bit salty but it made it even more delicious. I really need to work on perfecting my own recipe because I feel really guilty every time I spend $8 for some rice and mangos.   All in all we had a wonderful time. They are doing a promotion on their gift cards where if you bought $50 worth of gift cards you got an additional $15 for free. If we were in Vegas for longer than 2 days we would've bought them and gone one again but there are too many other things to eat!",

The Garlic Basil Fries were the biggest miss..... no garlic what so ever... very disappointing, and the salt and pepper shrimp also a bit disappointing. The Fresh Buddha Rolls were okay. I LOVE the drunken noodles with chicken, spices are fabulous, portions are good.  The basil fried rice....excellent!!! The lemon grass chicken is another big hit, and the duck curry was REALLY good as well.  For me..... I like the lunch and dinner menu a LOT more than the appetizer and happy hour specials!",

They line your entree with aluminum foil to keep the sauce from leaking - so you can enjoy it. I ordered the vegan spring rolls and the Thai Spicy Basil Pork!  I've never had the 'pork' option.  Fabulous!  Thin slices!  Also, normally this dish is 80% onions.  But here I don't think I saw any.  I requested a 2 out of 10 spiciest. Delicious! The steamed rice (which always sucks everywhere else) was perfect!  The spring rolls were good but I've had better sweet chili sauce if I'm keeping it real. :)  the portion sizes are amazing.  They have me (4) spring rolls for $4.95, every other Thai restaurant charges $5.95 for (3)!  This place is so legit!  I'll prolly order it tomorrow.  I'll get the dumplings instead of spring rolls.  I want the mango sticky rice bad right now!",

    "text": "We walked in during Sunday lunch time during MLK weekend, and the relatively spacious restaurant was completely empty. We should've taken it as a sign to go somewhere else, but I insisted as reviews on Yelp were good...  We had wanted to get the veggie tofu soup in a hot pot, but the waitress refused saying they only have the hot pot for the Thai hot and sour soup, not accommodating at all.   DRINKS: The Thai iced tea is way too syrupy sweet as previous Yelper had mentioned.  Coconut juice was not very fresh and a tad sour.   APPETIZERS: For a restaurant named Satay, the chicken satay is extremely DISAPPOINTING as the chicken was DRY and BURNT. The cucumbers looked like they have been pickled too long and turned color. When I mentioned that chicken satay was dry, waitress says it's because they use white meat. I've had white meat chicken before, and it's definitely not dry if you know how to cook it. The only good dish was the Roti bread, but you can also get a tasty one at Big Wong.   ENTREES: Chicken Laksa was not very flavorful just spicy. The chicken in there was also extremely tough and dry. Waitress again said it's because it's white meat and that our taste must be different since we are from LA! What kind of excuse is that?!   All the chicken were way too dry and chef special eggplants was oily and served lukewarm. The coconut rice is just ok nothing amazing. Something must've changed at this place because it is definitely NOT a 4 stars rating.   I had wanted to like this family restaurant, but the food is mediocre at best, and the staff does not care enough about customer satisfaction. Even though staff was courteous and brought water when needed, the repetitive excuses for bad tasting food says a lot about this restaurant in a strip mall.",

Upon entering Satay the staff is extremely friendly. All smiles.   This visit I was pretty hung over when I came in to have dinner. I decided on the Roti As well as the Yellow Curry these are usually my go to dishes for Thai spots fuck it up and well I probably won't be going back.   Anywho I was pretty in out as soon as I sat down I told the host I knew what I wanted and that I could pay immediately.  It didn't take long for my food to arrive and when it did it was hot and the portion sizes were good. The Roti Canai  which arrived first was simply delicious as you should expect in a good thai sauce. The same goes for the Yellow curry which I ordered with vegetable no tofu. I'm so used to having watered down curries that drop like water it was good to know that this Thai place knows what theyre doing when it comes to curry.  My only tiff when it comes to Satay is that considering that when I arrived it was dead I had every single server on site stop by my table. Um... I'm sure I only have one server not 5. But even with that said service was pleasant   Anyway if you're in Vegas stop by sit down and eat. But here's a tip Most places that say they do delivery don't not on the strip anyway. So call beforehand and double check if they'll even stop at your hotel",

When I was reading the reviews here on Yelp, I was a bit annoyed when people described this place as Thai as it was obvious from the menu choices that it was a fusion between Thai and Malaysian (sorry I'm a proud Malaysian foodie).   As described by many people, this place was really quiet when we walked in with only 1 other older couple. But I was happy that more people came after us. There was a family and a couple that came in (obviously regulars) because they already knew what they wanted.   Overall service was good but I felt one of the servers wasn't genuinely nice. She seemed a bit impatient with us but was super friendly to the family.   The food.... Oh my! DELICIOUS! And the portions were generous. I ordered the Curry Laksa which I'm happy to note is authentically Malaysian and my husband ordered a Thai glass noodles. I forgot the name. His dish was yummy too! Just thinking about the food right now is making my mouth water. The curry was thick and packs a punch flavour-wise. And the best surprise of all, they had sambal belacan (a sort of chili salsa). All the flavours  of home.... If we had found this place earlier, I would've come here every day!  Our 2 dishes plus tips came to USD 25. So the prices were reasonable too. So worth it.",

Much more spicy than I expected, but the flavors were still really delicious and fresh.  After having it for the first time, I crave it once a week!  I have dialed the heat down to 2 and it's a good level (for someone that usually orders a 3 at Pin Kaow).  Delivery had always been fast (I work in Howard Hughes) and the food is piping hot!  The serving size is generous- I always have left overs.  This is definitely a go-to lunch spot/delivery for me. :)",

It was about 5:45 pm and the place was not busy, but no, no tables for four of us as they were going to have two large reservations coming.  We were offered to sit in their outside area.  3. You can imagine, it is about 80 degrees in shade at this time of the year and I was a bit \"irritated\".    4.  However, they were very pleasant, served us very eagerly and treated us very nice.  5.  They advised us of the happy hour and all the snacks they had that were awesome and inexpensive like:  WIngs Thai Nachos (very nice) Beef Jerky Pot Stickers  There wer about 8 others like edamame, fried tofu, other meat dishes that we did not order .  This really made me feel that place is great because even in the adverse situation of being told we could not have a table inside when it was freakin empty, and still having a great time and great service means that this place is the REAL DEAL.  GK says, check it out!",

We were hoping to hit up Firefly in the same center, but @ 9pm on a Saturday evening without reservations, it was 1 1/2 hour wait for a table of 4 and we had later plans to get to.   Now what? Check Yelp!   We did, and this place looked like a good shot.   Our server told us it was 50% Thai, 30% Malaysian and 20% Chinese (yes, I can do the math :-) We had a selection of lamb curry, bbq pork, spicy beef satay and the basil chicken, along with every type of rice (jasmine, brown, coconut - coconut being my fave). All dishes were exactly the spice level we ordered - go for a 9! The flavours were vibrant and plentiful - great to sweat that 110 degree weather out :-)   Service was very kind and the best thing about this cuisine is the wait time for dinner = nearly 0. Perfect!   Ok, so the ambiance isn't your typical \"Vegas\"; rather subdued (they really do need to throw in a bit of music in the background or something). But it was nice to be in there, they have air conditioning, Singha, good food and great prices.   We left full and happy :-)",

You can find american \"food\" potatoes and crap on a bun, you can find steak aplenty, but all of it will make you feel sluggish and fat shortly thereafter.  There are lots of donut places!  Of course when you're in Vegas you'll have a car.  Actually I did it once without a car, but it wasn't easy.  So with your car you will be equiped with GPS, and your phone of course will be tuned to Yelp.FM.    So in my quest to go to someplace good, I found this great spot.  Huge outdoor seating and of course LV so perfect warm weather.  Sipping a beer while I'm thinking of what to order.  There is something nice about sipping beer in the afternoon.  I know I'm on vacation then!  The waiter brought me a copy of the local music guide, kinda like a village voice supplement or something.  I sat flipping through that while I waited for my drunk man pad-see-ew.  Yum!  Good veggies, nicely sauteed, I can't believe I'm in vegas, time to order another Singha!  A great afternoon experience, I'd search this place out next time I'm in vegas for a conference.",

    "text": "A good lunch special  dining experience: fresh shrimp roll, chicken pad Thai, and chicken pad prik khing were all good. Comes with house salad, yummy. Save room for the desert: We shared the fresh Mango and a sweet sticky rice dish.  Again, Yummy!  I don't much care for rice deserts but this opened up a new paradigm. My wife gobble up most of my share. Unique and very good. Overall a good dining experience, beautiful interior (don't be fooled by the strip mall exterior). Great for large parties. With coffee and desert and tip, overall cost was $25/person. See lunch menu picture for alternates under $12.   Chicken pad prik khing.  If you are looking for a dry curry, with a little chili pepper and something you have never tasted before, this is the meal for you. My gold standard for comparing Thai and Malaysian restaurants. The red color is due to trace amounts phrik (chili peppers) and the chicken is cooked in a chili paste. I chose a \"level one \" on spice heat, mild but enough to tingle the mouth.  Not recommended for people who do not like spice, but still very good flavor. Interestingly, the khing ( ginger) could not be tasted, I think because most restaurants rarely add it. The slivers of spice are fun to separate out and bite into, a woody almost sassafras like essence. I had this meal served with coconut rice, a very coconut milk flavored rice...Very good. It complimented the dish when mixed, it even could be tasted above the spice. Green beans were tender but the chicken was slightly dry. For this, it lost a star but still very good.   Chicken Pad Thai. Chicken, flat noodles, bean sprouts, Thai flavors, a side lime slice and peanuts. Good, a typical chicken pad Thai. A good starter dish for someone who has never eaten Thai.  I prefer mine without sprouts and an extra side of peanuts. I also prefer chicken cut into smaller pieces otherwise the chicken dominates the flavor.  Spring roll. By itself  this was fresh shrimp and lettuce with the only accentuating flavor coming from a fruity (hint of pineapple) dipping sauce and peanuts. Together it was good.  Thai ice coffee.  A dark roast coffee flavor offset by sweet condensed milk. Good, but I have had milder coffee that tasted better.",

I ordered the Laksa noodles, small plates of duck and Thai beef jerky. My son had the lemongrass grilled chicken. Everything was excellent. This is by far my second favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. It's my favorite for serving Laksa. The beef jerky was great too.  It wasn't hard and chewy but just soft and lean with a little crisp. The dipping sauce was very good. The lemongrass chicken dish was very good too. Nice marinade and grill to it.   When and if in Vegas again I will return to this place for some awesome Laksa.",

I quickly changed clothes, stripping the threads of business meetings and plunging into shorts and a t-shirt, I embarked on foot toward Steins of German beer. Crossing intersections for a few blocks, the late afternoon sun was taking its toll as my forehead began glistening from the heat. Remaining steadfast on my target of the Hof Brau Haus, I maintained course for a few more blocks. A tapas restaurant and a Moroccan restaurant proved tempting, yet the advertisement of ice cold Singha broke me down and stopped me in my tracks. I diverted into this hip joint and was not disappointed. Happy hour was a bonus, yet the star of the show was the ice cold bottle of Singha in the frosted beer mug. The food, which consisted of spring rolls and chicken Panang were equally satisfying. There is a cool vibe in this place with the trance-like music playing in the background and the dark wood, stone finish on the inside makes for a rich, frIendly environment. Will definitely be back.",

The ambiance is nice, clean, and pretty.  The servers are nice and professional.  They refilled our waters and came to check on us in good time.  The window table is drafty though on cold Vegas nights so we moved to a middle table and they were totally fine with that.  Their patio is under renovation but looks like it will be totally cool to chill there when its done. I LOVE their Singapore curry vermicelli stir-fry.  It is so addicting good.  It's spicy though so just a warning.  It's gluten free and vegetarian.  The bok choy with garlic stir-fry is delicious, maybe too much garlic for me but yummy (gluten free, vegan).  The summer rolls were pretty good, I wasn't that into the sauce but rolls were good (gluten free, vegetarian).  Momma's curry, a yellow curry was good and nice and warm on cold nights (gluten free, vegetarian).  It has a very nice chill atmosphere and feels refined so its very nice. Free parking in the strip mall lot is a big plus! Thanks for a great meal and the sweet Thai hospitality!",

It's their flatbread, topped with Nutella, fresh strawberries, banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were out of strawberries and vanilla ice cream, so they substituted slices of mango and a scoop of mango sorbet. There aren't words to describe how stupid delicious it was. STUPID delicious.  Will definitely go back and try their other dishes.",

I love the Singapore fried noodles. Probably because they're vermicelli noodles and that's my fave. Chicken satay is great. Papaya salad is good, can be a too spicy for some. Panang curry was tasty. Pretty standard thai food menu. Pad prik khing has good flavor but they cut the lemon grass into small pieces but they were still too big to take down. I would ask them to hold the lemon grass next time    My absolute favorite is the crab Rangoon. Omg fried imitation crab and cream cheese. So good. So bad for your thighs. But so worth it.   They have a frequent diner card. I've already scored $10 towards my bill.",

There may have been two or three times that I wanted to give this place a try in the past, but then I looked inside, saw it empty and decided to go somewhere else.  Well, not too long ago, I finally decided to give it a try.  Again, I looked inside and it was empty, but I was determined to knock this one off my list.  So I went inside, I have no idea why there aren't more people trying to go to this place.  1. I love the interior with its modern and hip decor. 2. I enjoyed the vibe which was accented by the mellow and soulful house music that was playing. 3. Though, I'm not really into it as much, they have an awesome hookah lounge area with comfortable seating, big screen and music. 4. Customer service was friendly and attentive. 5. Granted I was on a diet, the food was delicious and I am down to go back and try my usual Thai orders next time.  When I went I tried the Malaysian Sate (chicken skewers, peanut sauce and cucumber salad) and Tom Yum (soup with mushrooms).  I'm sure people go here, so hopefully next time, I can check it out when the place is more live.  In the meantime, I kind of enjoyed my private night at this joint for that particular night.",

Requested to add onions which was no problem- a bit crunchy on the veggies. Better than mushy veggies though.   My dislike- crab rangoon appetizer.  Tastes like hot cream cheese, no crab flavor.

Just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the Hughes Center is Satay Thai Bistro. We chose the convenient location, as we have on many other occasions, and weren't disappointed. No one was left wanting as their array of Thai & Chinese dishes catered to everyone's tastes. I was especially impressed with the service we received, it was almost overkill. My glass never got less than half full before receiving a refill. Better than being left dry! The staple item for me is the Thai garlic chicken with coconut infused rice. Moist chicken, enough garlic crispies to wake the entire cast of True Blood, and rice that was cooked perfectly. Lunch specials range from $8.95 - $10.95 and include a salad that is topped with a delicious carrot relish.   Also, it looks like they recently got new dining furniture. Well done! Before it was a bit dark for my taste. The new furniture is lighter and more inviting.  Lunch or dinner or after work cocktails, Satay is a reliable choice with good food and excellent service.",

To move on to the entrees I favor the combination fried rice spicy. The fried rice spicyness is 1-10 and I get the 5 because it's pretty spicy. You also have the choice of no spice. Then accompanied with my fried rice is the Mongolian beef. They recently remodeled a little the outside patio is now an indoor patio. They have a vegetarian friendly menu as well. This place is a must try when in Vegas. They have an excellent selection in their bar. Bloody Mary's are off the charts here.

    "text": "Nice off (but close to) strip option if you are craving Thai food. It is a nicely decorated, clean, business casual set up. Good parking. Prices were reasonable and lunch portions were more than enough for us. We got traditional Thai menu items: Pad Thai and the Yellow curry with the option of coconut white rice (yum!) The pad Thai was a nice balance of fresh and slightly sweet. The protein in it: Shrimp and steak were tender, flavorful  and cooked well. The yellow curry was delicious and had a nice balanced ratio between chicken and vegetables. The sauce was a bit thinner than I'm used to but it was really good. I ended up skipping the rice at times and just slurping the curry all by itself. It was that good! The chicken pieces was tender and good too. We finished off with mango/sticky rice which was also delicious, creamy and sweet. Service was excellent!",

To our delight, the food was really good.  Basil Fried Rice was flavorful with a good amount of various vegetables.  You may opt for chicken, beef or shrimp instead.  Hubby's Pad See Eew more than met expectations.  The Thai Tea easily passed the test.  Price is reasonable.  If we're back in the area, we'll definitely stop by.  It's off the main road, but not too far away, in a strip mall.",

Our hostess was very friendly and sat us right away. Our server was so adorable! We asked her if they had any beers on draft and she brought us out a bottle of Guiness that said \"draught\" on the label! LOL That was the absolute best!! My bf ordered the Mongolian beef and coconut rice. The Mongolian beef was amazing. The beef was perfectly seasoned and the sauce and grilled onions added so much great flavor! I had the tom yum soup spice level 7! It was so delicious! It was my first time having tom yum and I am so obsessed!! I wish there was a location here!!!! I also ordered the spicy beef salad and that was very tasty as well!! I'm really glad we found this place! We will definitely return next time we're in town!!!",

    "text": "I will be back!  That's for sure.  Although the beginning of our experience was poor, the food really made up for it.    My friend and I stopped in for dinner a little later than  the normal dinner rush hours and to our delight the place was relatively quiet and had quite a few open tables.  The host said we would be seated in just a few minutes but it took at least 10. I didn't really understand why because there were plenty of available tables and we were the only ones waiting.  They seemed to be a little understaffed so that may have had something to do with it.  Regardless we were finally seated.   The experience continued to go downhill as the server took forever to take our drink order and forever to bring our drinks.  And yes,  also forever to take our food order and bring our food.   Normally this would automatically mean a 2 or 3 star review from me,  as service really makes an experience,  but their food is so delicious I'm letting it slide.  We had strawberry lemonade,  which isn't lemonade at all in the sense of having lemons or lemon flavor in it. It was that they used strawberries as the ingredient instead of lemons and made a drink from that.  It was delicious and came with a big straw to get the chunks of fresh strawberry out.   As far as food,  i had the glass noodle stir fry with chicken and my friend had the Thai fried rice with beef. Both dishes were seriously A+,  some of the best Thai I've ever had.  Really huge portions and a superb price point,  especially for Vegas.   I'll be back... And I hope the service will be better next time!",

Chicken Satay - probably the only thing that tasted good. Really thin piece of chicken and the cucumber salad that came with it was drenched in some sort of syrup so it was super sweet.   Calamari - needs to be fried more so it's actually crunchy and more salt added. Most of the pieces we ate had no taste to it.  Chicken Wing - was okay but it was fried and drenched in more sweet thick syrup.  Thai Tea - beyond sweet. I literally could've poured my cup into 2 different cups, add more water and wala, got myself 2 Thai tea drinks. That's how sweet it is.  Tom Kha - nasty stuff. Not fresh and overcooked.  Pad Thai - wet, not dry and sweet.   Beef Fried Rice - was okay, not the best flavor.   Beef Pad Se Eew - looked so burnt up. It was so spicy to the point you can't enjoy the food.  All in all, everything was too sweet. Spice level is not the same. A few of us order with a level 6, some where super spicy and the others didn't taste spicy at all.   Service sucked. It was great before we got our food, always refilling our water and what not. Then once the food comes, not even once they came to refill our water or asked if everything was fine. The sad part was that they weren't even busy!   Will never come here and wouldn't recommend anyone coming here.",

And, what was even more impressive was the fact that the owner herself delivered all of the items to ensure that they were to her very high standards. I definitely recommend this restaurant for their delicious curries, satay, noodle dishes and veggie options.  My staff highly recommends the restaurant, too.  Great, friendly and accommodating service.  Another big plus is that the owner is very active and supportive of the communities she so proudly serves.  A great combination in my book.",

They have a huge menu which has something for everyone.  I usually get the chicken fried rice - they always allow me to customize my order to my liking and do not make me feel badly about it like a lot of other restaurants I've been to.  They also have a great happy hour - M-F 3:00-7:00 (I think) - which has several appetizers for $3-$5 and really cheap drink prices.  Their martinis are delicious and you HAVE to try their garlic basil fries.  They are the best fries in Vegas.  The prices in general are low, which is surprising since they are right off of the Strip.  My husband and I never spend more than $40-$50 including apps, alcohol & entree.  The staff is always super sweet and they seem to really appreciate their regulars.  They always recognize us when we come in & welcome us back.  They get good business but we've never had to wait for a table.  They also have a loyalty card - don't forget to sign up!  Satay is definitely our favorite spot in Vegas!",

Must haves: *Ask for Emmett and have him make you a Raspberry Cosmopolitan *The Pad-Thai noodle is actually among the best Pad-Thai I've had. Perfect balance of sweet and spicy. Texture and moisture is perfect. *Best Mango sweet sticky rice dessert too *Tom Yum soup uses real mushrooms, nothing canned (Thank goodness)  If you want a treat isit this place.

One warning though, when ordering spicy food i'd warn against asking for a 10 unless you have no taste buds. Someone in our group ordered a 10 and had to give up the meal because it was so damn spicy.   I've tried a variety of dishes here and everything tasted great. The chicken items especially are just absolutely delicious. They have great Thai Tea as well for those who love it. I don't think you can go wrong eating here they have a pretty large menu so there's basically something for everyone - including vegetarians.",

Ambiance was good nice and casual and not crowded the usual hipster music. -Drink, Strawberry Smoothie w/ boba great enough said. -Salad was crisp with a good dressing.  Negatives, it had a single brown leaf so happens and a little too much dressing but still tasty. -Honey BBQ pork, thinly sliced pork with grill marks and slight burnt edges so a True grilled delight.  The sauce was good.  Negatives, slightly dry and a little fatty but still good. -Pad Pak Ruam (veggie delight) w/Chicken, two kinds of mushrooms, chilli peppers, carrots, cabbage, celery, zucchini, broccoli and leaks.  I got the 4 spicy so it had a decent kick but not over powering.  Definitely taste the garlic which I like.   -Negatives, The veggies were not cooked evenly so broccoli was ala dente but leaks/cabbage was over cooked.  Chicken was dry so had to use the sauce and drink to help it down.    -Overall this is a good lunch destination for a quick bite to eat and not feel rushed.  I would come back just not an everyday venue.  FYI they do a military discount 10% for those staying close by.  The BBQ pork was the best so far.",

We found Satay on Yelp and knew it would be a good choice. I got the Thai iced tea and my friend got the taro slush, both were perfect. We ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken which was so delicious and the perfect appetizer. So flavorful and the perfect amount of spice. My friend ordered the panang curry and loved it!! I got the drunken noodles with chicken and they were amazing as well. Some of the best Thai food I've ever had and I've had a lot being from OC where we have lots of Thai options. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back and will tell people about it if they're ever in town!",

Nice place to bring a date since it is WAY dark inside with a full bar so if all else fails and your date isn't impressed with the food, you can always get her drunk and have your way with her in one of the somewhat secluded booths.  Was not impressed with the food. Roti was served like Chinese scallion pancakes without the scallions. Accompanying curry sauce was flavorless even lil guy wouldn't eat it. Rojak was totally wrong. The sauce had no trace of shrimp paste (belachan) and the ratio of fresh vegs to the fried items was unbalanced. UGH!!! I even told the guy I wanted a heat level of 8/10 but when I tasted it I could not detect any heat in the rojak. Hubby got the curry laksa which was the only thing which my palate recognized though it was missing something. It did have curry leaves so that was a plus. However was not perfect by any means.  Service was too much. Every 3mins someone would ask if everything was ok and it would rotate between these 2 servers throughout our meal. Then when it came time to pay it took forever. Go figure.  Authentic it's not. Nor is it cheap, but I guess you're paying for decor.",

I love that they ask you how hot you would prefer on a scale from 1 to 10. I got my dish at a 4 and it was just spicy enough to keep the burn without having to slow down to take a break from the heat or have my eyes water. If you like really spicy foods I would get higher but I would probably beware a 10! My waiter was awesome and was very quick and respectful, but the other guy in the restaurant was being a little sarcastic with the other patrons. I'm glad I didn't have him because I probably would have knocked a star. I would definitely come back if I can make it back to Vegas!",

    "text": "Happy Hour times have changed. It is Monday-Friday from 5pm-8pm.   Came here around 4:30 with some friends and just ordered off the regular menu since we were early. It has been some time since I have had Laksa ($9.99) and was craving this hodge podge of meats and noodles in a coconut curry soup. I usually like shrimp in mine, but theirs comes with chicken, fried tofu, fish balls, vermicelli noodles, and egg noodles. It was tasty anyways. I liked how they give the chilies and hot sauces on the side so that the spiciness can be adjusted while dining. Their serving size is large. A bowl would put most normal people out of commission, but I downed my meal and ate off my friends plates as well. I am not proud of this fact, but my work schedule plus my obsessive need to go to the gym has magnified my hunger. For now, it has not worked against me.   My friends got the Korean Short Ribs ($14.99) and the Sweet and Sour Chicken ($12.99). The beef was tough, but the marinade was good. The poultry dish was standard. The option of getting jasmine, brown, or coconut rice is available. We finished with an order of Roti ($5.50) with condense milk and powdered sugar. The fat kid in me always jumps at the chance to eat fried food tossed in sugar, but these were nothing special.   We had also got the Call A Cab and Red Dragon ($10 each and $5 during HH) specialty drinks. Their drinks are good because they taste like juice. This can go one of two ways; either you can be vomiting in a bathroom stall, or it really is just juice. I am ok with the fact that I did not experience the first option.",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the Malaysian menu after seeing some dishes I grew up on like nasi goreng, mee goreng, beef rendang, and a variation of Indonesian soto ayam that's called Laksa on the menu. The name satay will always be synonymous with my parent's Indonesian heritage of go to dishes that's served along their killer bumbu satay (peanut sauce). So this place had a lot to live up to for me yet I will tread lightly as this is the only Malyasian establishment I know of in Vegas. The setting is very modern and clean with ample seating. We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress. We ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce. Next was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting.  We would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly. At least you are doing it Satay Thai Bistro!",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Satay ever since they were on the corner of Spring Mtn and Valley View. There is one simple reason for this - they are the only place I know of in Vegas that serves Laksa.  OK so I've since heard that both Penang Malaysian Cuisine and Noodles also serve this delicious spicy soup. But I have yet to try their renditions. I really should be giving Satay five stars, but I must concede that their Laksa isn't quite as good now as I remember it previously. I think one of the reasons is that they now mix thicker noodles with the more standard vermicelli noodles. Also, for some reason, the broth now appears darker and not as creamy.  Still, for a good bowl of Laksa, I know where I can go; I just have to ask them to exclude the thick noodles.",

Their websites all had beautiful pictures of its many food items and I must admit I was hesitant at first to take any of the pictures seriously. Though I must say I was overly satisfied with everything this establishment had to offer.  Most Thai restaurants in Las Vegas have beautiful decor which is always a pleasant sight when enjoying one's meal, and this restaurant was no exception. The restaurant was also connected to a Huka lounge and by the looks of it they play live music on certain nights.  As for the food it was decently priced, especially when you consider the marvelous food presentation, and exceptional natural taste of the foods. It felt and tasted as if every ingredient was naturally produced! Every item we ordered not only looked beautiful, but tasted just as great if not better. If you ever wanted a superb tasting strawberry lemonade, well try theirs you wont regret it!  I don't quite remember my servers name but she was very sweet and so were the rest of the servers. It was also great to get a good night greeting from a man who i believe was the owner. Two thumbs up for that. It's been a long while since I've last been to a restaurant where I can honestly say I was already making plans in my head as to when I'd be returning. But Satay Thai managed that and more.",

    "text": "The only good part from the experience my husband and I got from this place was the shrimp and mango entree.. The flavor of the curry laksa wasn't so bad but for some reason, the chicken inside was only room temperature. My husband asked them to make him a fresh one and they insisted that it was fresh and that if they made it again it would be exactly the same. So my husband decided to order a different soup and got the coconut chicken soup instead. Again, the chicken in the soup came out room temperature. We don't know how they've managed to do it twice with two different soups!  I ordered the beef rendang and it was just ok, nothing special about it. The server asked me and I told her honestly what I thought about it but I told her that it was fine. I guess she told her supervisor coz next thing u know, the manager comes to our table. The part that irritated me the most was that he made us seem like we were lying about our complaints on the temp Of our food. To make it worse, the manager then proceeds to tell me that I probably haven't tasted authentic Asian food. I'm Asian and I've tried so many different authentic Asian food. They just managed to make theirs absolutely nothing special and not worth my money.  I'm only giving the second star for our server because she was very nice. To sum this all up, it was a waste of money. Needless to say, my husband and I will not be going back there again.",

That Singha sure did taste good.  Complementing that was the combo beef and chicken satay, with peanut sauce and mildly vinegar'd cucumbers.  This plate does not come with lontong, rice will have to be ordered separately.  The Vegetable plate was a definite pleasant surprise, refreshing, crispy tasty for outdoor munchies.    We were forced to sit outside because the restaurant was booked for a company private party, huge NAB convention tend to do that around town.  It was a happy misfortune on our part.  It is spacious and perfect for out of control loud discussions amongst good friends.  I ordered the Singapore noodles, because I'm also craving curry to go with my beer.  The blended seasoning of tumeric, curry and other spices and herbs successfully imbued that trademark smell and taste upon the noodles.  Super yummy for a super afternoon.  My GF, ordered the Chicken Satay, which she says is a terrific flavorful and deliciously tender nuggets on the skewer.  She says it was so good there is no need to dip it in the sauce.  My geektastic friend, who is trying Thai for the very first time, also ordered the Singapore Noodle.  Let's just say the look on his face is a mixture of uncertainty, fear, and curiosity.  He says it's good.  It is quite a departure from his usual fare.  The previous night, we visited the Japanese Restaurant, Musashi.  It was either this one or Musashi that evening.  Also of interest in the same strip mall is the Morrocan restaurant . . . .that's for next time.",

    "text": "I came here w/ the boyfriend for the first time on a weekday night while waiting for midnight bowling to start at Southpoint. As we were taken to our seats I noticed they had  hookahs AND beer towers setup off to the side, how exciting! We were the only customers, but it made for a nice romantic setting in the dimly lit restaurant.   After perusing through the diverse menu, we decided upon the following:  Grilled Calamari: Marinated and served w/ sweet and spicy garlic lime sauce - We both weren't very fond of this, but only because we're so used to having fried calamari, so we were a little taken back by  the texture and flavor   Chicken Tom Yum soup: Hot and sour soup w/ lime juice, lemongrass, mushrooms, and chicken - Honestly, I think this was the first time either of us have ordered Tom Yum soup and we were instantly in love. We've ordered Tom Yum about 4 times at other places after having it here and nothing has really compared. They use fresh mushrooms and there is a perfect 50/50 taste of hot and sour. All of the ingredients just go together so perfectly with not a single ingredient standing out more than another, which is the main problem I find at other restaurants.   Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle): Flat rice noodle, stir-fried Thai style w/ egg, bell pepper, onion, tomato, and basil - Perfectly portioned and served on an oversized plate. We finished the entire dish. The eggs, bell pepper, and basil definitely gave it a nice \"kick.\" The noodles were well cooked, not too hard and not soggy at all, just right.   Thai Garlic Beef: Sliced beef stir-fried Thai style in garlic sauce topped with crispy garlic served with crispy cucumbers and a sweet/sour sauce - Whenever we see the world \"Garlic\" on the menu, about 90% of the time we end up ordering the item. This dish was soo flavorful and aromatic. There was a lot of garlic, but it was crispy and enjoyable, not raw and painful like I've experienced with other garlic dishes. It went perfectly with the drunken noodles.   All in all, I'd love to come back here again. Perfect place for dates and I'm sure it's also perfect for groups during happy hour.",

I ordered a taro root boba smoothie, and a green curry with coconut rice.  Their spicy-meter goes from 1-10, and our server told us that it starts to get very spicy at 7.  My dish was spicy, but I like a lot of spice, so our server brought some additional sauces for us, which some of us did end up using.  My smoothie was delicious - nice and smooth with great flavor.  My curry dish was also excellent, and I really like the cocount rice.  I am not used to seeing that on menus, but it was recommended by our server.  All in all, everyone at our table was happy with their meals.  The portion size was perfect.  We were all staying at a hotel, so we didn't want leftovers.

The service is top notch, and it doesn't matter if a server is assigned to your table or not, they all ensure you have everything you need.    The menu is diverse and offers Thai, Malaysian and some Chinese.  They have a broad tapas menu with common offerings such as Buddha fresh vegetable rolls, egg rolls, samosas, gyoza, and more unique items such as grilled lamb chops and Thai tacos. Many of their tapas are on the happy hour menu for as little as  $3. We order about 6 tapas with our entrees and always end up with too much food (which, is not a problem IMHO).  The food quality is out of this world, and we have yet to have a bad meal here. Honestly, if you're in Vegas, stop here for a meal in their classy but casual restaurant; you will NOT be disappointed!",

    "text": "Note: I posted this review a few years ago, but then deleted it after Satay Thai bistro renovated to have more of a bar and tapas restaurant look.  I thought they had removed the dishes I loved from the menu, but I had it wrong.  The dishes are still there.  There are only two dishes that I order here because they are the best in Las Vegas: Curry Laksa or Mee Goreng. Five stars for these two dishes.  Remove one star for the rest which are just okay.  The curry laksa is a malaysian cocunut-based curry noodle soup. The addition of coconut, makes the curry a bit creamy. And then you add spice on top of that and the soup is heavenly. The mix of coconut, curry, and spice is not overwhelming but still hits the tongue with an explosion of flavor. The soup is the star of this curry laksa. The rest of the ingredients (noodle, bean curd puffs, fish balls, shrimp, etc.) are good but secondary players.  The mee goreng noodles at Satay Thai Bistro is the best I've had in Las Vegas. The mee goreng at most other places is overwhelmed by the tomato taste (kinda like sphaghetti) and/or not flavorful. Satay Thai Bistro's mee goreng is a subtle balance between the tomato taste and the spiciness. The noodles are coated with yummy goodness. I've only tried it with chicken or pork so I recommend either of those two.  Portion is on the smaller side.  Satay Thai Bistro is going for the tapas bar environment, so it feels a little weird eating there without ordering a lot of small dishes (tapas-like) or drinking alcohol. Also, seems a bit dressier than your average restaurant, but you can still come in shorts and t-shirts. The service is friendly, though a bit on the slow side. Plenty of parking outside.  Note: The above two dishes are unfortunately not on the lunch special menu.",

Hell, 24 hours is like 24 days in Yelp time, so of course I'm late to the Review Satay Party.  All the appetizers we had were really, really good.  Like unexpectedly so.  Standouts are the satays (obviously) and the chicken wings, but did I mention that EVERYTHING is really, really good?  Oh, I did?  The owner Jay-sun was super friendly, telling us stories of growing up around the time Karate Kid came out and people thinking he was actually just Jay.  Nope, it's Jason.  Super nice guy, and I'll definitely be throwing some business his way whenever I can.  If you're a beer drinker, obviously get a beer tower when you go.  I'm not much of a beer drinker lately but somehow managed to have two glasses between stuffing my face.  Oh yeah, and their happy hour is ridiculous.  It's like 4:30pm-8pm on weekdays and noon to 6pm on weekends.  That's a lot of hours to be happy!  The play is to come out on a Tuesday evening and then stick around for karaoke.  Make sure you sing \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra!",

Satay has a clean and cozy ambiance to it when you walk in. I came with a big group and unfortunately that probably contributed to my overall experience here. We attempted to wait for  everyone's dishes to come out but that was a bad idea. All of our food got cold because it took a good 50 min for everyone's dishes to come out after the first person getting theirs. Eventually we stopped waiting but all those who waited already had cold dishes in front of them.  Aside from that, my food and the flavors itself was not really anything out of the ordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai, a pretty basic and popular dish that really cant go wrong. Mine came out pretty bland unfortunately. I don't really see myself coming back here on my next visit unless its for happy hour or something.",

The individual satay options are perfect if you're looking for a small snack and don't want to pay too much for it.  The service here is friendly, but can get slow when it's busy.

Lumpia - delicious Crispy Chow Mein w/ Chicken - by far my favorite dish of the night! Green Curry w/Chicken - Kacey ordered and loved it.... I didn't try Fragrant Coconut Rice - I didn't care for it but Kacey did Orange Chicken - I ordered but thought it was average Sweet and Sour Chicken - much better than Orange Chicken, good flavor Thai Garlic Beef - tasty and you get to choose how spicy you would like it Chicken Satay - chicken on a stick. pretty basic.

Crispy bacon, with the chewy scallop after taste, can't go wrong with this appetizer. Main course I ordered red curry, which was as good as i ever had it.

    "text": "Splurged for another delivery order from Satay for dinner last night and while everything was tasty, especially the coconut rice, there was a mixup with our order.  I ordered their traditional won ton soup, but received their wor won ton soup (which includes lots of veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp in addition to the won ton). Broth was weak and flavorless, but the fresh veggies, shrimp, and won ton were very fresh tasting. Wish the carrots had been cooked just a bit more though. I am not a big fan of crunchy veggies in my soup. The won tons were wrapped separately, so I initially thought they forgot them entirely.  My mellow was harshed temporarily until my meal mate uncovered the m.i.a. wontons in a separate container, and my world was filled with sunshine once again.  Satay's wontons are wonderful!  The other entree we selected was the combination chow mein with fried noodles. Now these fried noodles are not your standard Chinese fast-food hard and pasty flavorless sticks ... These fried noodles are light as a feather, flavorful all by themselves, and added a wonderful texture dimension to the generous amounts of chicken, pork, shrimp and veggies.  A little on the dry side, as a noodle entree goes, but a dollop of my soup broth incorporated the ingredients well and resulted in a happy diner.  My favorite thing on their menu, thus far, is still their coconut rice. Delicately infused with coconut essence ... this rice makes an excellent side, and would go well with everything else on your plate. TRY THE COCONUT RICE!  Still pricey at $40 for a large soup, combination chow mein, coconut rice, delivery fee and tip.  And not even a fortune cookie at the bottom of the bag. :(",

    "text": "So you want to eat Thai food with Class this is a great place to go. I love coming here and grabbing a Singha beer and just relaxing eating one of my favorites Thai food! My favorite dish here is the Spicy basil beef, they must've recently changed the recipe because I vaguely remember the beef being more like ground beef. It makes me sad that they changed it but its still my favorite dish there.   Food:  4/5  The best, or the top two Thai Restaurant options in Las Vegas.  Service:  5/5  Friendly, not too pushy, and attentive.  Value:  5/5  Generous the portions are just right with even lefts overs for later.  Location: 5/5  Close but not that too close to the Strip, great place to dine and grab a couple of drinks right before you head out for a night on the town.   Parking:  3/5 They share a parking lot with a couple restaurants which makes it busy during peak hours. So sometimes you have to park quite far and walking in heels can suck but its understandable.",

The remaining apps all looked good, the bartenders and food runners were all more than helpful in grabbing an ice cold glass to pour the remaining oz's of Singha; delicious.    I was able to sample a few entrees, one being Mama's Curry - Mixture of Dark Chicken meat, Red Curry, and Potatoes.  Also had a little Coconut Rice and Coconut Boba Smoothie, which were both amazing!!!  I was very fortunate to spend a little time with my Yelp friends and look forward to all of our future events.

Intrigue turned into love at first sight when those delish Indian curry samosas came out of the kitchen. These bad boys were perfectly crisp on the outside but oozed potatoes, peas, and curry sauce on the inside. [Insert Lip Smack. YUM.]   Love kept flowing when the Char Kway Teow (yummy flat noodles sauteed in shrimp and several Malay/Indian spices) came out. Not too oily; not too spicy; and tremendously flavorful. [Insert Second Lip Smack. SLURP.]   The record came to mild stop at the Roti Canai. While the curry sauce was fab, the oily parathas (bread accompaniment) left their residue on my tongue and fingers. [ICK... and the only reason for the 4 star rating.]   All in all, we will def. be visiting Satay again. And, considering how late this place is open on weekends (our server answered \"'til whenever,\" when we asked about timings), it might become our new fav. weekend night spot.",

When we first looked at the menu, we realized that this was not a strictly Malaysian restaurant.  On half the menu, it offered Chinese food.  The other half had Malaysian/SE Asian/other category.  Being adventurous, we asked for recommendations from the waitress.    She ordered for us the Nasi Lemak Satay Special which came with 2 chicken satay (which were tasty), a beef item (good), a pile of dried/deep fried small fish, and fried bananas (the batter was a bit much).  She also got us a Mee Goreng noodle dish which I thought was very tasty.  Loved the Malaysian Chicken Curry.  Nice complex flavors.  The deep-fried green tea ice-cream was nothing special, the batter was too thick and the ice cream itself has some patches of ice.  To wash it all down was coconut milk served in a coconut.  Not shabby.  A place I definitely would hit up again when in vegas.",

It's affordable and they have a variety of different asian dishes to select from.  The first night, I did take-out so no comment on the service itself (though the girl who helped me out was uber nice and it was quite fast).  The food was pretty good so I was happy to go back the second night to actually sit down to eat.  Had some Thai noodles and some satay skewers... everything was very good.  The service is a bit slow considering there weren't that many people there but the server was very nice so that's fine.

    "text": "We decided to try the place out during restaurant week. A five course meal seemed like a good value, I love Thai food and it was for a good cause. It was a good decision.  The interior is somewhat appealing and the servers are polite.  The first course was the satay, one piece beef and one chicken. It was juicy sweet and not overcooked -- some of the best I've had outside of Thailand.  Next was the papaya salad with shrimp. Even at a setting of 7/ 10 it was incredibly spicy-- exactly what I wanted. I ended up eating both of them because my girlfriend found hers too spicy. It was crunchy and had enough vegetables in it to stay interesting.  Then came the tom yum kai -- a spicy sour red soup with chicken-- well known to any Thai food fan. The chicken was plentiful but the soup was a bit saltier than it should have been and the broth seemed a tad too thin. Still good but not up to the standards of the rest of the food.  Then came the curry and rice. The rice was infused with coconut and was heavenly even when eaten plain. The curry was a thick classic red with duck. It was my first time trying duck in Thai curry and it wasn't bad at all. The meat was extra juicy and the spices in the curry more than adequate.  Around that time came the pad thai-- which was honestly the best I've had outside Thailand. It had plenty of crumbled nuts tofu and vegetables and diced eggs in it to make it quite a memorable dish. Sweet with just the right amount of spicy.  Lastly of course was dessert-- fried banana garnished with vanilla ice cream. Quite a hit with my girlfriend. I left feeling pretty satisfied about the meal and its cost. It's hard to stand out in such a saturated market but this place is worth trying for Thai fans in Vegas.",

    "text": "I'm happy to say that Satay popped my Thai cuisine cherry as I have never had Thai food prior to this.   Again, I relied on my fellow yelpers for the best recommendation for Thai food and I stumbled across this gem. Located off of the strip but not too far is this cute bistro and bar. It's in a retail shopping center of sorts so I'll admit, I was kind of like ehh is this birthday dinner material orrrr... haha but it definitely was!  I tried the drunken noodles with shrimp, the veggie summer roll app and an order of chicken potstickers. All of which were equally amazing! One note that I would like to share is regarding the spice levels offered.  Now I'm not a spicy food person by any means but I do enjoy medium spiced entrees without having to worry about chugging down a glass of milk afterwards. However, I played it safe with the 5 out of 10 and can honestly say I wish I had just gone spicy. Even my friend's dish which was rated at an 8 out of 10 wished they had just gone with the spicy. It was very subtle. Kind of didn't taste it all but my friend did say his mouth was tingling as he continued to eat.   Overall, the service here is great and fast. The food was amazing (though I don't have anything to compare it to). Prices were moderately fair between $10-22. I really enjoyed my time here and the food!",

Every visit has been very good even when I come here with high expectations from previous visits, and you know this, man! =)  Service: On point and very friendly as always.  The staff is constantly checking on the table and keeping the drinks fresh.  Satay has always had great wait staff, salute to the management team for the great service consistency.  Food:  The Laksa curry soup is tasty and with the perfect amount of spice.  Curry is one of those things that can go wrong at the meal and AFTER the meal if not made correctly.  The Thai Beef Jerky is very very tasty, flavorful and I can throw down a whole order by myself, I get that greedy with it.  The calamari, duck, roti canai and the curry samosas are all plates I'd suggest on top of these two all stars.  Value: Great pricing for the quality of food and service you receive but the drink menu, #1 af!  $5 for selected bottled (Corona, Guinness, Heineken, singha) and draft (Blue moon, Coors Light, Stella Artois) beers. $8 Carafe of the House sake.  The value of the food, service and the most extra booze value, is what really makes me love this place.  Ambiance:  Contemporary, Thai and Asian design theme inside makes for a very cozy dining experience inside.  Some flat screen TVs line the wall with sport channels.  Open room seating with enough space and the correct lighting to keep it intimate for a date.  It's also well setup with long tables to accommodate bigger parties.  This is a great restaurant to swing by to get some great Thai food and pre-game before a night out on the strip or anywhere for that matter.  The drink prices gives tremendous value to the dining experience and let's not forget about the great wait staff and their service.  It's places like Satay that gives compression to higher end Asian restaurants, step up your game if you charge more.  Lots of value in this foodie city otherwise known as Las Vegas...enjoy!",

They do not have private booths or room, but they will do their best to make sure a large group is taken care of.  The service here has been good. When it gets really busy, you may have to flag down your waiter though. Their Tom kha soup is flavorful with prominent lemongrass aroma. The red curry is tasty with my spicy level of one (does that even qualify as spicy?) and they add a good amount of whatever protein you pick i.e. chicken. Spring rolls are made fresh to order with their lunch specials as their best value. For dessert, you have to try the mango sticky rice as it is pretty standard to finish your meal with some sweet mangos drizzled in coconut milk. They used to have honey toast available, but not anymore. I do recommend making reservations if you have a party of five or more though, especially during lunch hours of 12 to 2:30. All in all, a reliable spot for Thai lunches.",

That's a Malaysian dish I love, but it's hard to find. It's even harder to find a really good one. The one here is good, but not really good. That matches much of the rest of their food. That said, I've never had a bad meal. There are a few dishes that are really good. The Satay can be really good. The duck is usually really good.

The roti canai was pretty good.  The mee goreng has the pad thai flavor, but with different noodles, and the flavor was a little bit too much for our liking.  The duck was dry and bland; i think it would be safe to assume it was cooked and left under heating lamps odor over 5-6 hours.  It really tasted like it was left overs from the night before.   The only thing that gave it flavor was the plum sauce.  We saw reviews on yelp about how good the duck was, so we we're pretty disappointed on what was served to us.  The only items we both really enjoyed were our tea (the only items we didn't take pics of).  The service was good, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and I wouldn't come back to eat here.",

I hade the Thai Garlic lunch special at a spicy level 9. The salad, which came before the main dish, had a delicious creamy carrot sauce. I easily ate the whole thing (about a cup of salad). The Thai Garlic with brown rice I enjoyed so much I didn't mind that my dish didn't have any spice to it whatsoever. However, with the extra spices they bring to the table, I was able to get it to the heat I wanted. I used the chili paste and the diced serranos. Yum yum yum!",

When I wanted to speak to the manager and was told this guy was it, I decided not to. The service was extremely slow and not overly busy. The waitress was very nice and polite however. Food was perfect, again. Outside of pathetic management, this place is excellent. Enjoy the food.",

    "text": "So since my first review, my boyfriend and I, along with several combinations of friends and my parents, have been here probably more than half a dozen times. I still LOVE the Thai beef jerkey and the nasi goreng. I order these every time without fail. Their Boba slushies are also very good. A friend of ours who has come several times seems to really love the curry.   The staff here are always friendly and attentive. I like that they will still refill your water even when you've already paid the bill but are just hanging out catching up with friends. It shows that they appreciate their customers and are not trying to rush them out. We have used the point card religiously and have gotten the $10 off coupon 2 or 3 times already.   My dad is one of the pickiest eaters out there and when he and my mom visit from Hawaii, this has been one of his favorite places. Take it from me, but also take it from my dad, when we say this place is awesome.",

However, this place is The Most skimpy of all Asian restaurants I've experience on their vegetables and sides.  That's one thing I love most about Asian restaurants. The veggies! You're not walking out of this place paying less than $8.50 on yourself for a lunch meal.  I LOVE their Panang curry. It comes with a protein of your choice and served with bell peppers, salad, and rice for Lunch. Today, I ordered it and I literally got 3 thin slices of bell pepper.  This place does have great food and decent service but for the price and what they give you for vegetables, I feel it's over priced, otherwise it'd be a 5* place. I go here every now and again. Maybe a few times a year, and it's walking distance from where I work. They need to up their veggie game and I would probably go there more often.",

I really enjoyed the cucumber salad the comes with it.Refreshing -My wife and I split two dishes, the Pad Thai and the Thai Garlic Chicken. We ordered both at a 5 spice level and it was perfect. For me anyway since i am just experiancing hot foods for the first time. I have had Pad Thai at other places and it is usually a safe dish but you never know what it will be like. Satay's Pad Thai was perfect and i am already craving more. Very friendly and alert staff in a packed place on Friday night!",

Staff has always been friendly and attentive and some friends and I have watched a few of the NBA play off games there. There is a chill lounge area with low leather couches/tables where they have a projection screen for big games. You can order food/drinks and relax in that area instead of sitting at a dining table.

I don't know about how the evening experience is, but the mid-afternoon is quite hip and relaxing. If you're in the area, it's a great value!

    "text": "On a Thursday night my friend and I wanted to hit up Firefly on Paradise. Unfortunately, there was an hour long wait. We were starving so instead of driving somewhere else we decided to check out Satay, which is in the same plaza. It was kind of funny seeing how different Satay was compared to Firefly. Firefly was packed with people with plenty of others hoping and waiting to get seated. But over at Satay, we strolled right in and got seated immediately on the patio.  The siu mai ($4.95) was decent but forgettable. The roast duck appetizer ($8.95) was the best thing we ate. The skin was crispy and the meat was plentiful and savory. For my entree, I went with the honey BBQ pork ($12.95) which was a large mound of meat piled on top of some veggies. Most of the meat was tender, succulent and sweet, but if you get this plan on eating family style and sharing. It's pork overload, for sure.  Service was decent. Food was pretty good. I still would have preferred eating at Firefly if we could have gotten in, but Satay was a nice alternative.",

They said ok we will imprint it the old-school way.  Fine, do what you need.  The imprinted receipt came back to me.  They pointed to where I can put in the tip.  Hmmm...  Of course I tipped!

I only know this because my step dad spent half the time making life metaphors that I think pertained to the pretty women running around. But! Besides the good looking women the food was good too! I had one of those Satay skewer sticks with peanut sauce with their $2 side coconut rice. Yum. Pad thai was full of flavor! Not one that tastes more noodlish than flavorish. It had the good peanut taste with less of the noodle flavor. Also had the ragoons. And the thai flatbread with curry sauce for appetizer. If you're into appetizers that is plain bread with dipping sauce and you like the curry taste then I'd suggest to try it. It's pretty good I mean for $3 in happy hour not bad. But if you don't like plain tastes then I suggest you pass on it.",

I ordered the Beef Rendang with coconut rice and a Thai tea.  The entree took 15 minutes and arrived hot an nicely arranged.  The spice was just right with a little kick but still flavorful.  Overall the food was very good and the service excellent.  If I had any complaints it would be the acoustics of the dining room it was very noisy for no busier than the place was, very difficult to hold a conservation.

The first time I went in with the hubby and five year old for Sunday afternoon lunch.  We were the only ones in there which I thought was a shame.  For all 3 of us, the bill was around $50, and we ate a ton and had adult beverages as well.  What a deal!  The weekend happy hour is extended...noon to six I think.  This beats an uptight brunch any day!  So, we had laksa, sweet chili chicken wings, roti, pork satay, and crispy duck...all good.  I wouldn't say the duck was actually crispy though, but it was still really good.  The satay was so flavorful and tender.  The wings were sweet, sticky, spicy, and wonderously crispy.  Roti was buttery and served with curry broth.  And the laksa, which I've been wanting to try, was a meal in itself (for 3).  I think it would make a great hangover remedy...warm and comforting and spicy.   I brought the girls here the following week.  We ordered all of the same stuff, plus calamari satay which was the best, extra orders of roti, and large amounts of wine. We sat on the patio even though it was over 100 degrees outside, but with the misters, it felt great.  It was a little busier this time around so the service was not quite up to par with the first visit.  They screwed up our bill a little bit and charged full price on some happy hour items, but it was all worked out in the end.",

Maybe, I just picked the wrong dish: pad Thai, not a particularly compicated dish, but here--oh, well--when things go wrong, they go really wrong.  The rice noodles were chewy and smothered in an overly sweet sauce.  I stuck with the vegetarian version with tofu, etc.  All in all, it was passable, but certainly not on a par with better Thai restaurants in which I had eaten.  I'll certainly try it again and revise my review if the food is better than I recall, just for the sake of the excellent service and pleasant atmosphere.",

We ordered the roti canai and chicken satay as appetizer - both good.  We also ordered beef pad see ew and shrimp pad Thai and beef rendang and garlic shrimp.  All great food. Great blend of Thai and Malaysian food. Definitely would go back there again.",

    "text": "It is very unusual to find authentic Malaysian food in restaurants, so when you come upon a restaurant that does Malaysian food this well - stick to the traditional food (and don't order the Thai food on the menu !) I ordered the beef rendang, which is soaked in coconut milk and spices. It is very tender and practically falls apart in your mouth. It can also be quite spicy (depending on what desired rating you give them) so be prepared. I got a 5 out of 10, and was downing water. My boyfriend ordered the nasi lemak - a rice dish with many interesting ingredients melded in - hard boiled egg, small anchovies, roasted peanuts, cucumber slices, a spicy sauce, and shrimp.  The flavor profile of Malaysian food is completely different from the more common Asian foods you'll find around (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai) and I recommend everyone try it once. This restaurant had good drinks, a pleasant ambiance, and good food. It was, however, very much off the strip. Oddly enough, no cabs would stop for us on the way back and we walked 45 min back to the Strip in heels so be prepared. (Of course, being off the Strip lent the restaurant better prices AND food).",

The Tom Ka soup and the boba were exactly how I wanted them to be, and how I'd hoped they'd taste. So definitely no disappointments there. My friends all loved their food too. And I had an urge to just hang out drinking this amazing Vietnamese hot tea afterwards outside on the patio for hours. If I didn't have so much work to do, I totally would have done that.

After a long day trip to Grand Canyon we were hungry and searched online and decided on Satay for dinner (saw the stars in yelp and decided). The atmosphere was fine and nicely decorated and we requested the waiter for an outdoor seating.  They have a quite big menu and we order Roti Canai and Vegetable curry Samosa.  Both platters seem to be Indian dishes and they taste excellent. We are tempted and ordered one more order of Roti Canai. Nasi Lamak with curry chicken served with coconut rice.  The chicken was delicious and in addition we have half boiled egg and cucumbers. Nasi Goreng - fried rice served with shrimp, squid and half cooked omelet .....it was yummy and shrimp is flavorful. Singapore fried noodles - it's a vegi noodles with no egg was perfectly cooked and tastes excellent. Green Curry - cooked with peppers, coconut milk and egg plant...just tasted and it was fine. i checked the online menu and each dish was self explanatory with most of the images. All the dishes were not so spicy and we asked for extra chili sauce!!!  I am not sure about the local crowd, but we were lucky to be there for dinner without knowing much about it. Totally I was impressed with the food and service.",

If you like Asian food and like the South Asian influences, this is the place for you!  The Roti with Curry sauce is a no brainer....we had to order a second plate.  The Laksa is sooooo good as a hangover meal.  I love it spicey and they didn't do too bad a job.  I just wish we could do it with rice instead of noodles.  That would have really made my inner South Indian child happy!  The beer is cold and the waitresses are cute.  In fact, they have a Satay calendar with their female wait staff and other asian models.  I gave mine away since I don't think my wife would approve.  :(  You have to give this place a try.

    "text": "My friends and I were visiting from LA. Initially we were going to the tapas restaurant across the parking lot, but that place was packed so we decided to go for Thai (which was fine because we're all Thai food lovers). When we got here there was a party of about 20 that had just been seated. After waiting forty five minutes for a table (when the place was not even packed) we seated ourselves because the staff were too busy to seat us? We sat at a dirty table that had not been bused so I asked the buser to bus the table. He was very polite and customer oriented.  Our waitress then came over and took our order. After that we did not see or hear from our server for litteraly ONE HOUR. After growing impatient, I finally got the attention of our busser, and explained to him that I knew that he was not our server and I have worked in a restaurant before, so I was wondering why we haven't been served in over an hour, and he politely got the manager. The manager came over and said that \"it was busy\" when there were only 3 other tables there, and one had a party of 20, but still... customer service was really lacking.. If they were that busy back there, they should have made up with good customer service, which they definitly lacked! There were 5 of us at our dinner, and we each ordered our own dish, yet each dish came out litterally 30 minutes apart from each other.... It was really odd.. Anyway at the end of all this, the manager obviously knew that he was at fault so he offered us a free dessert (for all five of us to share). He did not offer to give a discount on the food.  We were litteraly in the restaurant for 3 and a half hours. Waiting. It was ridiculous.  The food was great, but it was definitly not worth the wait or the horrible customer service.   My thoughts: should've just waited at the tapas restauraunt",

I'd recommend it for lunch, especially for my university colleagues who've become bored and jaded by the lackluster restaurants that are just on the other side of Maryland Parkway.",

I decided to come back a few weeks later since I was in the area and regretted not indulging the first time LOL!  The first table offered was too close to the front door and it was a bit chilly so we asked to be moved and were quickly whisked to another table. Our waiter came over a few moments later and explained the menu.  I loved everything we ordered. I must warn you though, they do mean business when they say their plates are spicy. Holy crap.

We've frequented this place probably 5+ times now, and we've consistently had a great dining experience no matter what we have ordered.  1) Pad Thai--This is the best pad thai I've ever had in recent memory. The sauce is perfect. The tofu is at a perfect consistency and the fried outside is super flavorful. I would prefer if they threw in more tofu though. We went there last night and I think they put in a total of 3 small tofu pieces. Really?  2) Curry Laksa--So yummy! So decadent! This is a must-try! We always feel guilty eating it though, 'cause all that flavor and deliciousness can't possibly be good for us. Guilty pleasure :)  3) Roti Canai--The curry that comes with it is phenomenal. I would prefer the roti bread less oily and thinner/crispier. Tastes great nonetheless!  We have tried other dishes as well, but I can't remember what they were. I just remember we've never had a mediocre experience there. Consistency is very important to us. I'll be sure to update this review if we order anything else on our next visit.  We usually split an order of 1 entree, a side dish, and a bowl of rice. They have good-sized portions so that's perfect for us. Our total bill comes out between $25-$30, including tip/tax.   TIP: If you like spicy, ask for their tray of assorted spicy chilis! We load up our dishes with all of them! MMM!",

We got the pad see ew which was good with the right amount of sauce and oiliness. The beef rendang was tender and flavorful. The coconut rice was so good I could eat it by itself. We also got the roti appetizer and the Singapore noodles which were also great. Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Came in for dinner and noticed the large selection that all sounded tasty and worth trying. We started with the Malaysian Chicken Satay. I really enjoyed the peanut sauce that accompanied the chicken skewers. Also with it came cucumbers and onions in a sweet chili sauce, which was delightful. After grabbing a cold Singha, we got the Roti with a Thai curry dipping sauce. This dish reminded me of the street vendors in Chiang Mai. The roti bread seemed a little heavy, and the dipping sauce could have been thicker. However, it was still a good side as the curry flavor makes up for it. For our entree, we ordered Singapore noodles with chicken. These are thin vermacelli noodles. After we added some red Thai chillies the dish had the kick we desired. Over all a satisfying dinner, and the service was great! We would come back for happy hour.",

To be fair, though, at the time we were the only customers in the restaurant (there were four of us plus my toddler son) so if service had been anything less than spectacular, I would have been surprised.  We ordered crab rangoon, vegetable samosas, honey walnut prawns, Singapore Fried Noodles, garlic eggplant, brown rice, some beef dish whose name I didn't remember, and mango sticky rice. And we killed it ALL. Our server must have thought we were the greediest people on earth. Whenever he checked on us, we all had damn near cleaned our plates. And he checked on us pretty often.   I would like to come back for dinner, and to check out their hookah bar if I was ever in town again. And maybe try out some actual Satay.   I love Satay!",

I didn't really want to find a new Thai place since this one is within walking distance from my office in the Howard Hughes Center. I was very frustrated with my take-out order of the buddha rolls (see picture posted) and bummed they eliminated the dark meat chicken satay, but, I should mention the steak and white meat chicken satay were very good. The best thing on the menu here, IMO, is the yellow chicken curry.   Thank you Jay for taking time to write a reply to my review.",

    "text": "JL, Thank you for responding.  An issue raised and validated by my previous post is that instead of simply apologizing, there is a vast amount of rhetoric preceding an apology.  Aforementioned, the service and its perception has declined and we have been the recipients of the outcome.  After giving proper chances and observations, It is not a habit to patronize such businesses that continue to fail us as very \"easy\" customers.  One might ask how easy a customer I (we) are/am when I write such reviews.    A review is the recapping of an event in the perception of the one reviewer.  You in your reply did question my accuracy which is your right.  It is our right to avoid businesses that excuse with image-saving tactics rather than in two sentences express regret and ask how to fix the issue.   Your wish to invite us for diner on you is appreciated and will be considered.  In response; 8/18/2016 , one star for your rhetorical response.  You question my review and its accuracy?  To question a quantitative and qualitative researcher is absurd.  To question a once loyal customer is out of the question.  I believe you and a female worker were eating dinner at the table towards the front door that evening this happened.  Your service has declined severely since we started patronizing you.  Two of your staff know my family well as we always order the same thing.  Needless to write, you were given several chances and that night was the last straw.  That party was not at the bar and received full meals.  The appetizer excuse works on the unaware.  Next, the other couple came in way after us but received service (food) first.    The problem is, When a person or business is asked to be responsible, they shift responsibility so I thank places like Yelp that give a voice to those like myself and my wife who are international.    The food there is good and my vegan friends began enjoying your cuisine however, they follow our recommendations.    Instead of letting us walk out that night because you were made aware of our wait, you should have apologized, and made it right.",

When our waiter approached us, he looked us and then his eyes widened as he spoke like either the light by the window was super bright or he was on something. That was a bit awkward. I've never had that reaction before. At least he was normal later on...  I got the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with veggies and tofu and my cousin got the beef rendang. I tried a bit of his and thought it was alright. The portions for my Pad Kee Mao were huge and they had a nice wok heat, but I've never had tomatoes in that dish before and while I like tomatoes, I'm not sure I liked it in that dish. The tofu was overfried as it was brown and there weren't too many pieces. I've had better.  I love how they have a huge selection of Malaysian, Singapore, and Thai food and nice pictures on their menu. Their menu was actually really nicely formatted, but otherwise, I am hesitant to rate this 4 stars. It was clean and quiet with good presentation and alright taste, but I didn't think it was the best. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.",

    "text": "The first time I went to the restaurant was at last Thursday with my friend. The decoration is really good in my opinion. The two main color of the outside building are white and brick-red with few huge windows, and the inside was even better. The interesting art work, white chairs, wooden table and light yellow floors made the restaurant look elegant and quiet. I would like to give a 9 out of 10 for the decoration and environment. The waiter was really friendly, dressed nicely. We asked few questions about Thai food since he was from Thailand. He showed the greatest patience, and answered everything we questioned. I would like to give a 9 out of 10 for his service. We ordered what the waiter suggested to us, yellow curry and satay. The food came pretty fast. Yellow curry, which was really delicious to me. The rice steamed perfectly, and the curry was also really delicious, sweet, spicy, and the flavor was really strong. It might be the best yellow curry dish I ever had in Las Vegas. The problems could be the rice was not enough for me. I spent 1.5 dollars for the extra rice. Then, I tried satay which was also pretty good. The skin was crispy and the flavor was sweet and strong. My best part was the peanut sauce. Therefore, for the food, I would like to give a 9 out of 10. The price was reasonable. Although it might be a little bit higher than other Thai restaurant, the flavor and environment was there. The two dishes cost me approximately 25 dollars. Therefore, for the price, I would like to give a 7 out of 10. All in all, the restaurant was pretty good, the environment and decoration was great. The quality of service was great. The flavor of food was delicious and the price was reasonable. I would like to give a 8.5 out of 10, and I will definitely visit again in the future.",

    "text": "Entering the parking lot, I did not think much of this hidden jewel as the parking lot was bland and the atmosphere of many other Las Vegas visages, grimy with the remnants of spilt alcohol and the sound of cars driving by. The front door was a tinted dark black, to keep out the heat no doubt, and the handle was cautiously covered with a heat resistant covering. As I entered the restaurant, I saw an area devoted to a local anime gathering. Paintings and graphic were along the wall depicting popular anime characters. Upon entering the second door, I was greeted with a smell of curry and could hear the kitchen bustling about. The first sight was the empty bar. Even though it was empty, it was clean and inviting. The dining area seemed rather small with a row of booths and a second row of tables in an 'L' shaped pattern.   There was one area of the restaurant that seemed closed off as room separators were in a line across the upper 'L' shaped room. Behind these, I could make out more tables and an unlit area.  We were sat right away with no wait. Upon sitting down at a table, I noticed three other groups that were enjoying their food and conversation. After reading the menu that was filled with delicious looking items, I settled on the Beef and Chicken Satay as it was the namesake of the restaurant after all. It took less than 5 minutes for the food to arrive and the smell was that of peanut butter and a sweet smelling zucchini slaw. The meat was less aromatic but looked succulent non-the-less. The peanut paste was more viscus than peanut butter and the zucchini slaw looked similar to coleslaw minus the cole, add zucchini slices. The meats were covered in a sauce and looked like any other skewered meat. After savoring a small bit of the beef, I could taste the umami along with a hint of a sweet tasting roasted flavor. Both the chicken and the beef tasted similar and did not differ say for the meat type, mostly dry and bland if not for the sauce. Again, tasting the meat, this time with the peanut sauce provided, the overwhelming taste of peanuts hid much of the beef and chicken flavors but multiplied the sweet umami flavors of the sauce. The texture was a bit tough and lumpy with a quick, thin, creamy layer. The zucchini slaw was very sweet, even though I am not too keen on zucchini, I could not turn away from this sample of soft, sticky, sweet, moist, seasoned pleasure.   The peanut sauce did well to balance the flavors of the umami and in fact complimented it well. I was not sure the purpose or use of the zucchini slaw, but it was enjoyable also.",

Yellow curry is the second thing I like to eat from this place and after ordering this meal multiple times.. it is safe to say that the yellow curry is a great choice.  All together, as far as the quantity and quality side of this restaurant, I believe I will continue to order lunch from this place if ever I feel like eating pad thai and yellow curry... i have not explored the menu much so I cant say anything about any other dish.",

Everything from the atmosphere, to the cleanliness, to the staff and most importantly the food was very good.  The Chicken Pot Stickers and the Pad Thai was excellent and they both popped with a ton of flavor.    For me the creme de la creme of this restaurant is the Mango Smoothie with Boba - DELICIOUS.

Not to mention they lied said they processed the refund of $7 Three weeks later i still haven't gotten it!

Well -- as it turns out, ibdod order some fried rice and I was very specific about my egg allergy. First bowl came out -- LOADED WITH EGG! Oops -- so they made me a new one.   Scallops were overcooked and not to my liking. No vegetables in the fried rice.   They also have a roasted pork appetizer which was good.",

I can't wait for the temperature to warm up a bit and I'm going to this Happy Hour spot for Tuesday Karaoke Fight Night.   The owner Jayson is actually very personable which makes my review even more biased because I only ate 2 items on their menu. Chicken wings and Satay were delicious! But any joint where the owner puts their sweat and soul into the food (minus real sweat) is a good joint for me. I really hope this spot will be busier than Firefly because I love both in this plaza.   Next visit : sit on patio, order everything on happy menu,  and beer tower.",

Maybe not the best choice as I was nursing a slight hangover, but Satay turned my whole day around. Service was extra attentive and helpful. They kept bringing me waters because it's all about hydration.  Appetizer:  Roti canai - must have at any Malaysian place and I was happy that they produced a near-perfect version.   Entree: Beef Rendang - I wavered a bit between this and noodles but was glad I chose this. Big portions of beef, very tender and tasty. Brown rice availability was a welcome option.  The lunchtime crowd was sparse with a bunch of single diners and small groups of overweight tourists. I'm sure everyone came away pleased by the meal.",

The meals are very good and reasonably priced. my favorites are the panang beef curry, and the garlic eggplant dish.  Lychee martinis are awesome ( $5 happy hour), need to make my way to a asian market to get some lychee syrup for home use.  Good service, dining inside, outside or takeout.  If you live within a few blocks on east side of strip they will even deliver, although I never did that because it's only a one block drive for me.  The crab rangoon appetizer was disappointing, but everything else I enjoyed.  The chicken wings are surprisingly good, tangy sweet sauce.",

    "text": "Why had we not discovered Satay until now!?!   That's what we left there saying this past Friday night, after we went in for the second weekend in a row!   After searching Yelp for some happy hour hot spots a few weeks ago, I found Satay. Misti said 'Asian small plates rock' and I was sold. However I wasn't exactly thrilled about Singha beer, but I was willing to give it a shot anyway.   When we first sat down and I saw the sad selection of happy hour apps, and the fact that they only had Singha on special, was almost a deal breaker. But we already drove all the way down there, so we both went for one of the tropical drink specials, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. My Sawa-tea was tasty and what a deal at $5! We finally broke out of our rut here too and ordered something besides the usual papaya salad and massaman curry (the first time that is). The satay was super fresh, the veggies were done perfectly both times. The green bean curry type dish we had the first time was also incredible! I want to know, \"where do they get there beans?\" they are absolutely the best ever!   This past weekend we had to go again and try out the papaya salad, substituting grilled shrimp for the typical dried shrimps, sounded perfect and it was. Without a doubt this is the best papaya salad I have ever had and I can't wait to go back for another! So overall the food is OUTSTANDING, the service is OK and the only major problem I can find is the Singha beer, where's the Chang? Or at least Tiger? Anything but Singha!",

My mother and I went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was very crowded and severely understaffed. We ended up spending an extra hour+ just waiting for our drinks, then our food, then our dessert. Being a party of 2 it was obvious that we weren't the priority to the servers. I don't know if that's how it normally is there but I have to say that the extremely long wait killed my whole experience there, and I am not one who often complains about waiting. I have to say the waitress did bring the bill to us in under a minute though so I guess certain things are more prioritized than others. If you're looking for your SE Asian fix I would recommend, but don't go if you're on a tight schedule.",

    "text": "After having to cancel the UYE planned for that Wednesday night we decided to take advantage of the fact that we had a babysitter in place and take the evening to enjoy a small Happy hour hop and what better way to do that then to kick it off at Satay..  I was hoping that Jason would be there so i could introduce him to the wife, since the last time I had enjoyed satay was with the yelp crew at the CMYE.  Even though Jason was not there the staff that was there was super friendly just as i remembered and was more than fast with the drinks and service.   We decided to order a drink and a few appetizers and of course i had to go with the Singha which was ice cold and amazing, Becky ordered a Malaysian Mai Tia which looked great and got her night off to a great start. I recommended we order the satay along side our lumpia and crab rangoons and to my delight it was just as delicious as the first time.   We finished up our appetizers and were just about to pay the bill when the server said... Oh, hey how would you like to win a free trip to Thailand?.. I stopped for a second and said WHAT? So he stopped for a moment and explained the Singha corporation loyalty card.  For every Singha you drink you get one entry into the drawing that will take place at the end of the year at Satay which you do not have to be at to win.. Also if you eat lunch there and show your card you get buy one get one lunch specials with your loyalty card.. How sweet is that!!!  I was impressed with Satay from the first time i tried it and i must Satay, I will continue to come here for the great happy hour eats and ice cold Singha!!",

    "text": "Thanks to Anthony Bourdain we discovered the malaysian beauty that is Laksa, a mild curry noodle soup that is served with egg noodles, rice noodles, fish ball, shrimp, and crispy tofu, sometimes referred to as Curry Mee depending on the restaurant. Laksa is unlike any curry you've ever tasted, its not as spicy and lemongrassy as a thai curry, its not a sour sort of acquired taste that is a japanese curry, its delicate, its buttery, and absolutely freaking delicious.   The Laksa here is hands down the tastiest Laksa I've ever had. It ruined me,  I cant eat it at any of the other local places I used to go to.   You can feel confident ordering from either the thai or malaysian side of the menu. I'm incredibly picky about my thai food; gratefully this place never dissapoints. My favorites aside from the Laksa are, the Roti with curry dipping sauce. The Roti is buttery and flaky like some kind of perfect biscuit/pancake hybrid, the dipping sauce is the same curry thats used in the laksa which I've already told you is delicious. The Thai Omelet with chicken is thin, crispy and never greasy, add a little sriracha and its just the way I like it! I also love their pad ki mao and the beef rendang; the sauce on the rendang will make your lips tingle just enough to make you sure you want more. When they ask what kind of rice you want make sure you say \"coconut\" and then make sure your friends do too, some fool always tries to order the brown rice and then ends up eating all your coconut rice.       They have a full bar, a large lounge area, and patio outside for the smoking diners.",

    "text": "Well then.   The only words I could think of when leaving the warm and inviting doors of Satay.  I was here last night for a Yelp meet up and LOVED the beer towers, and assortment of appetizers that are available during Happy Hour. I should point out that the Happy Hour is more like a Happy Session because it goes on for multiple hours.   I took a picture of the Happy Hour menu because I didn't want to forget it:  M-F 4:30-8PM and Sat/Sun from Noon-Six.  $5 Various Appetizers $5 House Cocktails $24 Tower of Beer (I call it the Tower of Power)  Two things REALLY stand out aside from the great food and atmosphere.   1. The owner Jay-Son (I think that's his name) is very engaging, and is very passionate about the menu and his restaurant. It shows. He will come and talk to you in a non-creepy and non-invasive way, and share his restaurant with you.   2. The bathrooms are very clean. I am usually a stickler for this and tend to mark down points.  It's worth a visit. Definitely on my short-list for birthday venues (August 22 hint hint) and also a great place to take your tourist friends before a night out on the strip!",

I had the 1/2 roast duck and it was a huge portion, more than I could finish, the skin was soggy vs crispy, the way I prefer it. My son had the lamb curry, it was not seasoned great and a bit dry. My wife had the red curry tofu which was the best dish of the bunch. Maybe living in Northern CA I am spoiled, but I think it was average to just above average Thai food.",

Happy hour specials are equally as great. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner!",

No complaints from the cashier while taking the order. No hold ups. And, I even heard another customer calling to place an order. Good phone etiquette is a sure sign of good service and it was.   My food was tasty, hot, and on time. Price was reasonable. Courteous service. Clean. Spacious. Plenty of parking. Can't ask for much more.   I don't like to review the food specifically. My taste is unique from most. So, what I might say might be misunderstood. But, I can assure you that when everything is good like I explained that mostly whatever interests you will also be good.   Furthermore, what might be good one day may not be good another. This is a business review, not a class on being a food judge. I have an extensive culinary background. I could pick apart the difference in how a raw tomato tastes. I'm not here to grade in detail about food. I'll let you be the judge in that. If I told you what to eat and you don't like it, I could jeopardize my reputation on the restaurants mistake. You choose for yourself. But, I'm pretty sure this place will make good food more often then most.",

Seafood tasted bad and old(spoiled). We order the fried fish.. Didn't look nothing like the picture at all... The fish that they gave us was small and it cost $25. Nothing special for the cost. Then we ordered dark meat chicken curry. Turned out to be chicken breast and It didn't have the authentic Thai curry taste...again pre package seasoning.. The only saving grace is a descent crispy duck and a basil French fries. I left feeling hungry and disappointed. With all the good review.... I felt this was misleading. Ask the locals before you trust any reviews online. If this place was good for you, you are missing out. Good luck!",

There didn't seem like too much technique or preparation went into the dish.  It was tasty, meaty, and less than $15 for a half duck, which is considerably cheaper than most places, but the quality was not on par with an amazing duck experience that one would hope for.  I wouldn't mind coming back here as they have a few Malaysian menu items that most Thai places don't venture towards that seemed worth a try, but if you're strictly looking for Thai or an exceptionally well-made duck, then I would try China Town or more east in Las Vegas.",

We'd just had Thai food the night before at Lotus of Siam so we were heading (based on Yelp recommendations) to a tapas place.   When we arrived at the shopping center, though, the place looked jam packed. We noticed Satay nearby and made a last-minute decision to have Thai again. I am so glad we did! This experience was far better than the highly rated Lotus.   First of all, this place is beautiful. Romantic mood lighting and comfortable booths. We  cuddled up together and ordered a beer and a cucumber martini, which was on their specials board. The bartender came out from behind the bar to ask us how we liked the drink! It was really delicious, muddled with basil, and so aromatic. Our waitress was really lovely as well.  We started with calamari satay which was yummy, not too chewy, and came with a delicious sauce. Then we had coconut rice (do not miss the opportunity to have this!) and lamb with red curry sauce and beef short ribs. We both loved our respective dishes so much that we were happy not to share, though we did sample the others' dish. My lamb was to die for. The sauce was perfect. Spicy, savory, buttery. And the lamb was falling apart in my mouth tender. The beef ribs were also crazy delicious with a sweet vinegary sauce.  The prices are super reasonable and we had a wonderful time! Will definitely return.",

    "text": "If you're visiting from out-of-town and craving for delicious and authentic food, Satay Thai Bistro & Bar would be the best place. The restaurant is about a 6 minute drive from the Las Vegas Convention Center. It's in a small plaza located across from Hughes Center on Paradise and Corporate. I came right after work for their Happy Hour. Finding parking can be a little tricky due to limited space. Inside it looks modern and clean. Plenty of seating available. There is a beautiful statue of an elephant standing near the bar. Elephants are known for their incredible strength, mental agility, and long life which is why they are a chosen symbol for Thailand.   I was seated right away and given a menu. They have so many great selections of items from savory, spicy and sweet, rice dish, meat entrees, noodles and soup, and there is a menu option for vegans as well. I start off with Coconut Juice ($3). This is a delightful and hydrating drink that's served in an actual coconut. You use the spoon to scrape and eat the fresh coconut meat. It can be a little tedious but it's so worth having it fresh.  For Happy Hour appetizers, I tried the Garlic Basil Fries ($4). These are shoe string fries that are very crispy but it needed a little more garlic. It's served with a sweet mayo sauce. I'm not sure if I like dipping fries in mayo but it was tasty. I also ordered the Crab Rangoon ($5) and these are my favorite! It came as 5 pieces of fried wonton with crab and cheese filling served with a sweet chili sauce. They make it crunchy and the cheese is so creamy. The Curry Samosas ($5) are 5 pieces of crispy dough with curry filling also served with a sweet chili sauce. The curry flavor is good but I don't think sweet chili sauce goes well with samosa. It actually taste better with chutney.  They have a menu for Summer Specials and what got my attention are the Avocado Fries ($8.99). They give you 6 pieces of deep fried avocado wedges served with a spicy cilantro sauce. These fries have a nice crunchy batter and the avocado makes it feel like I'm eating healthy. I love the spicy cilantro, it taste amazing! The magic is in the sauce, it's like a sweet and spicy chutney. I end up dipping all my garlic fries and samosas in that spicy cilantro. It's what makes the food taste good.  For entree, I opted for noodles and tried the N8 Mee Goreng with Chicken and Shrimp ($14.95). These are big servings of egg noodles wok-fried Malaysian style. It has fried tofu, bok choy, and bean sprouts served with jalapenos and a side of fried onions. It's mild, savory, and super flavorful! Chicken is tender. Shrimp is juicy. This is a meal I would order twice! Seriously it's that good. For dessert, I went for Banana Fritters served with vanilla ice cream ($8.95). They use regular banana and not the plantains. It's deep fried with coconut shreds giving it a crispy texture. It's like having a sweet banana ice cream sundae in Thailand style. Overall, I'm very happy with the friendly accommodation and attentive service received from Min. This place has great quality flavor and it's definitely worth returning!",

    "text": "I didn't realize that the coffee shop at Lied Library is closed on Sunday's so I had to resort to ordering food from a nearby spot - since I was studying at the library today. Part of me is butt-hurt about having to order food since the price I paid for one dish can buy me groceries for 1 week (starving student diet), but the other part of me is happy I had the opportunity to try the delicious food served at Satay - because I would have never had the opportunity of trying this place, since I usually pack a lunch on long study days. Two things happened today: I was able to try a place that I actually really enjoyed and tried GrubHub for the first time and was very satisfied with my experience.   So first, Satay Thai Bistro & Bar. I originally had intentions of ordering spicy beef green curry, but after reviewing their menu, to my surprise they also serve Malaysian food! Oh my Thai! I was beyond excited and so I quickly changed my mind and placed an order for my absolute favorite Malaysian dish: Mee Goreng Noodles with beef, spicy of course! At that moment my taste buds started watering and my tummy growled with excitement! My 35-55 minute wait time couldn't count down sooner! LOL. Ordering on Yelp and having it delivered with Grubhub couldn't have been easier; I placed my order, input my payment information; waited a good 30 minute; received a text from my delivery guy; met up with him and got my food! Easy like Sunday morning *wink  Back to the food. Hah! Yup just like I had imagined it to be it was DELICIOUS! I loved how they packed on some sliced jalapenos on the side (peep my picture), with a small little container of chili sauce - after adding everything the spicy level was perfect! Although this one dish cost me $20+ (with tax, including tip and Grubhub delivery charge) - I would say it was all worth it!   Besides the cost of everything *tears, the food is delicious and I would totally order this dish again and again!",

Of course I didnt finish because the portions are so large and the price is spot on..all that food for only 11.95! I did share my leftovers with a nice boy who was hungry. It was an odd situation but I knew he needed to eat. Even though I wanted to take my food home, I felt ok with offering it to him. Everyone needs a little kindness. He was very grateful and happy. And, Im happy too  Customer service is exceptional and very attentive. Beautiful decor and a very large bar with plenty of flat screens to watch sports, news or whatever is good that night.  Im a regular and always will be! Highly recommend. Located on Paradise near Hughes Center, 5 min drive from the strip.",

It's located right on paradise across from Howard Hughes. Same parking lot as tacos and beer...   The ambiance is casual and comfortable. The service was friendly and quick. They have a great lunch special that I would definitely recommend. They also have a full bar... their well tequila was only $5.00... not bad if you mix it with soda and fresh lime. I ordered the vegan garlic eggplant and brown rice. Everything was super flavorful and cooked to perfection. The spring rolls were also delicious. The curry samosas are vegan and were probably the best I've ever tried!! They have lots of really good vegan items and a full separate vegan menu! My boyfriend is not vegan and ordered a chicken panang and really liked it. Great spot for lunch or dinner. Definitely recommend if you're in the area!",

They're tucked into a plaza with a bunch of other restaurants and storefronts, but they definitely have plenty of parking to go around for their customers. I came in and was immediately sat even though I rolled through at peak time for lunch. They have plenty of seating and incredibly kind and professional staff. They offered a lot of lunch specials which is an extra win. I tried their mango smoothie with boba, summer rolls, and red curry with tofu and loved every last bite of my meal. All in with tip, it ran me around 27$ for lunch, which I think is a little steep, but you get what you pay for and I had such a wonderful experience and enjoyed their prompt and kind customer service that I was happy to pay it for their lunch service.  Definitely would recommend and will absolutely be back in the future.",

The menu offered lots of choices for dishes, including choice of meat and I was able to customize each dish through the GrubHub section of Yelp. (Super easy to use btw!)  Pros: - the pad Thai, pad see ew, fried rice, and salad were so delicious. The pad Thai especially was very flavorful and the chicken wasn't too dry.  - the yellow curry came with a side of rice!  - GrubHub deliverer was super nice and sweet. Came a bit later than expected but she made sure to call me to ensure she had my correct location.  - all the dishes weren't too salty!! Everything was packed nicely. I loved how they lined the containers with foil! Super PLUS!   Cons: - despite how delicious the fried rice was, my boyfriend found a piece of hair in his portion (!!!!!) - Yellow curry was a bit watery for our liking :( - the beef in our salad was too dry and flavorless   Overall, my pros outweigh the cons. I had to take away one star because of the hair. Would love to visit the restaurant and experience a meal on site.",

I only tried the Malaysian dishes here, so I can't speak for the other ones.  I think their satay is pretty good and their peanut sauce is not bad. I had the prawn mee, but I thought this dish could be improved. It definitely smelled like prawn mee, but when I tasted it, I felt like something was missing. Also, the broth looked really red and spicy, but it actually wasn't spicy at all.  Their food is actually not that bad, but I wouldn't call it 100% authentic. I think the price is reasonable, but I think their food could be improved a bit to be justified at that price.",

Food that I always love to order and enjoy everytime:  APPETIZERS/ STARTERS  Indian Rojak (a \"salad\" of fresh beans sprouts, julienned cucumber, fried tofu, shrimp fritters, and sliced boiled egg among other things topped with a delicious, very mildly spicy sweet-savory puree dressing.. trust me, it's absolutely delicious).. this is my all-time favorite dish they serve  Roti Canai (pan-fried indian bread that is tender and flaky served with a delicious savory curry dipping- or in my case, dunking- sauce)   Chicken Lettuce Cups (nothing incredibly unique about this, but it always comes out with the filling steaming hot, well-seasoned (with bits of water chestnut that add a pleasant crunch), the lettuce crisp and fresh and the hoisin sauce that ties it all together. Delicious.  Fish Cake (Kikiam)- (the serving is rather small but if you're a fan of kikiam, the type they serve here is definitely good quality)  MAIN COURSE  Crispy fried pork chops with sweet and sour sauce (crisp and tender, in small pieces for easy tackling, and never greasy; the sauce packs a punch of flavor without being too cloying)  Singaporean Noodles (this can be a tiny bit greasy sometimes, but I've had this at many many places and this joint serves it up LESS greasy)  Oh, and the coconut juice on the drinks menu is served in an actual whole green coconute and comes tasting cold, fresh, and not-to-sweet- always perfect!",

Some of our group were against eating Thai but this quickly changed as the dishes began to appear! By the way incredibly fast delivery on the hot food! The host set up a long table for us and projected the football game on the wall. I highly recommend ordering the towers of beer. I think we finished 5 of them easily. Great price. I have traveled extensively through Asia and recognized the authentic food right away. Nasi goreng, Lumpia, and Roti. All favorites. A mix of Indo, Malay, Thai and mandarin.  This is a very welcoming, authentic place in the heart of Las Vegas. Great prices. We all felt like we got away way to cheap. Will definitely come back in the future.",

Girlfriend and I went to this place on a whim, and it was a pleasant surprise. It looks nice from the outside, but interior decor is rather run-of-the-mill with limited ethnic flavor to it, but not without reason. This place serves a mixture of Thai, Chinese and other Asian and Island flavors. You can be very tame and order a well known Chinese dish or try a more risque Malaysian dish, either way the food is cooked just right and the servers are very friendly and knowledgeable in recommending cuisine.  The place is large and is good for group meetings. The parking is pretty good for the location. The deserts are a bit lacking, but the ones that are present are good. The food is prepared quick and in good flavor, all is done right, albeit not spectacular. However, when the price tag is considered, this place is top notch! Lunch specials make it even better.  Don't forget to visit this place next time you are in the \"Chinatown\" area of Las Vegas, you should be happy with the value for the money and your tummy will be satisfied as well.",

We ordered three appetizers as well as these main dishes, Phad Thai, Phad Ki Mao, Yellow Curry, and Phad Prik King.  All dishes were wonderful.  We ordered mostly Thai food but they have a large number of other Asian choices too.  The staff was very friendly.  We ate outside and the atmosphere was great.  We laughed and had a great time.  My Coke glass was refilled many times and quickly.  They served jasmine rice as well as coconut rice.    I suggest you go with friends and family.  I wish we had a restaurant like this where I live.  We certainly will be back next time we drive to Las Vegas.",

For my entree I had the orange shrimp with jasmine rice and it was awesome.  i only wish I had a few more shrimp pieces on my plate.

I ordered delivery on a Friday in the 11p hour (they close at 12a on weekends). Very friendly transaction. I ordered my favorites; Chicken Satay, Crispy Veggie Rolls, and Red Curry Chicken. Food arrived hot, within the 20-30 minutes as promised. Food was delicious and safe to say the best meal I've had delivered in the three weeks I've been out here. This will definitely be my go-to Thai restaurant. Next time I'll be ordering another favorite -- Spicy Basil Leaf Chicken (aka Chicken Kra Prow) and I'm confident it will not disappoint. I even failed to mention I like my food extra spicy and there ended up being extra chili paste/sauce included in the delivery bag. Well worth the price!",

    "text": "\"The tired souls wandered through the desert desperate for respite. Their energies all but drained, all they could hope for was refuge from the heat and a place to refuel.\"  I just made that up right now...damn I sound like an author...lol. But in all seriousness, it describes accurately how my friends and I felt.   It was our first day in Vegas for the weekend and we were hungry, thirsty, and still getting used to the dry, desert heat. We all vouched to eat food at a place we can't get back home and were gonna hit up the buffets the next day so we wanted something more of a sit down type of dining establishment. So like I usually do I hop on Yelp and find this teppanyaki spot similar to Benihana that I believe was also featured on the Travel Channel. Long story short we make it out there but can't seat us because we don't have reservations and the wait for a table is an hour and a half. So we say \"Screw that!...what other spot can we eat!?\" So we just happen to come across Satay Asian Bistro and Bar. And I must say I've become truly enamored with the place. Once we entered we were quickly acknowledged and greeted. There is dim lighting and great decor. Sports was on the TV. The food here is a combination of Malay, Thai, and Singaporean dishes. Service was on point but the most importantly the food was delicious.  We ordered Thai beer...Singha...never had it before but enjoyed it.  *Chicken satay stick * Pork satay stick * Honey glazed bbq pork * roast duck * steamed rice  Portions were generous and reasonably priced. Our server was very courteous and suggested to us some things to do on the night life scene locally. They also throw there own lounge, happy hour, dj event every Saturday no cover. I'll have to go back and check that out someday. This place is off the beaten path...but definitely worth checking out.",

The happy hour drinks a re sinful and yummy - Call a Cab in a great fruity, colorful drink. As I'm vegetarian and most often make healthier decisions I'm not too into the happy hour food selection but I'm sure many would be.  Everybody LOVES the coconut rice. Rich is a fan of the mango shrimp. I've tried the Tom Kha Pak (Veggie Coconut Milk Soup,) Phad Kee Mao (Spicy Basil Noodle) - all were fantastic!

    "text": "Amazing food & service. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide if we wanted Thai, Chinese, or Malaysian food, and ended up finding this gem that serves a little bit of all three! The place has a cool, laid-back vibe to it, and the service/people were really welcoming and friendly... we even learned a little bit of Thai while waiting for our food. The place seems to draw a steady group of regulars, but we (the tourists) didn't feel out-of-place.  Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating with a cool little lounge area on the back wall, as well as a large bar. This would be a great spot for a large group of friends or a little party - and the menu definitely has something for everyone. The happy hour specials were a great deal - with higher-end cocktails topping out the price list at $5 . On a hot afternoon, the \"sawa-tea\" is really smooth and refreshing (but still packs a punch). I also saw they had a ton of non-alcoholic drinks, too... just didn't really sample those.   We ordered the roti canai, the crab rangoon, the beef rendang, and the mee goreng. Our waiter, Noel, recommended 3/4 of the above and we couldn't have been more satisfied with our order. The beef was savory and delicious, with a nice balance of spices, and the mee goreng was just a little bit spicy and sweet without being too sugary/saccarine  - I recommend getting the chicken/shrimp add-on, if that's your thing - but even if it isn't, the dish comes with perfectly pan-fried tofu glazed in the dish's signature sauce. All the accompanying sauces were really really good (especially the sauce that comes with the roti canai... I could literally drink this stuff, but I recommend pouring it on the rice!).  Even though we were both starving, we had plenty of food to take home with us at the end of the meal.  We'll definitely be back next time we're in Vegas for happy hour/lunch/dinner.",

As we walked in we were warmly greeted by one of the girls, and seated immediately. We just happened to get there in time for the last bit of Happy Hour prices for a couple appetizers.  Roti Canai $3 - closer to Malaysian/Indian dip than sweet Thai dip Lumpia $3 - yums Chicken/Steak Satay $6.50 - Chicken was better :) Thai Iced Teas - can't go wrong  On the recommendation of our server, we ordered the Thai Duck Curry (red curry with pineapple, bamboo, roast duck, and bell peppers) about 8/10 level spicy served with coconut rice. Let me tell you, I'm not normally a fan of sweet and savory flavors, but this dish had each ingredient harmonize in a mouthful of hot deliciousness. Next time, I'll go for a touch easier on the spice, though it was a nice kick, I want to accent the delicate blending of flavors from the coconut rice, and duck red curry, instead of slightly overpowering it with heat.  We also noticed the have a full bar, a Saturday night DJ line up, and... HOOKAH, of which you can order at any time! We decided however to not do hookah on a full stomach. Not so pleasant, as I've learned first hand.  And to top it off, we had started walking down the street to our hotel, and one of the girls ran after us across the street to hand me my scarf that I'd forgotten. She wasn't even our server! Now that deserves my 5th star. :D",

I had the Thai nachos which were fantastic, but more Mexican than thai - basically a shrimp ceviche with mango and peppers on rice crackers.  I also had very good drunken noodles.  The service was prompt and extremely friendly.  Parking is plentiful.  Highly recommended.",

We ordered the pork sate, a noodle dish and the malaysian fried rice. The food was perfect and we even had enough to take home.   This a great spot for a group or a date to enjoy the night.",

Right away, the ambiance, music, and were phenomenal.  We were greeted as soon as we got into the door and seated immediately.  Our server was so nice and had a great energy about her.  She gave us time to look over the menus and I can honestly say that we had a hard time making a selection since it was so varied.  Definite plus. We ordered the following- Garlic Asparagus, Pad See Ew, and the Steak Salad.  Everything was delicious and on point.  My only regret is not living closer because this would definitely be my go to Thai place. We also had a few drinks which were super yummy and on happy hour too, to top it off.  $5 a drink and some bomb food.  I have nothing negative to say at all.  :)",

We ask our server he said they changed it because there are people requesting for choices? Hellloo, the reason is kind of silly! If ever the customer want to take out something in the ingredients like if they are allergic to shrimp or squid they should have just request for it. There might be a new management or they cut cost, i just want to say to the management in charge you should have put the price up a little bit if you want to do that but dont changed the ingredients that the customers are used to because we just order it now its not the same as we like it.

    "text": "Asian small plates rock, especially when served with a nice, tall, cool tower of Singha beer. I was able to revisit Satay for my CM \"coming out,\" but this update is strictly about the yummy Asian happy hour treats I ingested. Singha beer: delicious, and the beer towers are quite effective at keeping that stuff cold, especially when you have stellar servers bringing out the cold mugs. Some of those new stars definitely reflect my joy at being able to order a  beer tower! As for the happy hour food, at $3 a plate, this is one good deal. I could feed a whole Yelp battalion for that price, and I did. The spring rolls, samosa bites and edamame were my favorites: delicious and served piping hot. Now, the chicken wings are not on the happy hour menu, but I definitely recommend getting them. They are fat little things fried-up perfectly and served with a finger-licking sweet and spicy sauce. Whoever they have on the fryer has mastered it quite well. Oh, and the satay are yum-azing. Sometimes satay skewers are dry and stubbornly cling to the stick, but not these. They are juicy and come right off.   Add all of this up and serve it on a patio, and you have a new must-try happy hour spot. I know it is tempting to just roll up to Firefly, but isn't it time you tried something new?",

Bell peppers, mangos, and shrimp on top of shrimp crackers for a very fresh crunch.  I wanted something meaty in a curry, so ordered the Beef Rendang with coconut rice. Generous portion, 8oz at least, of fork-shreddable beef cooked in a very spice-rich curry. After my meal, I told the waiter it was great, with my only suggestion being a bit more veggies. There were 3 cucumbers that provided some palate-cleansing between bites of meatiness, but it didn't last long. He said they're mostly for garnishment and this is how Beef Rendang is traditionally. Paleo-friendly.",

    "text": "Me & 5 others were in from Rockford, IL on vacation and decided on Satay for the last dinner before we left to come home.  Myself & another friend did some recon on local Thai restaurants and read some reviews & the menu & decided to check it out.  Wanted something preferrably off the strip, reasonably priced with a menu that was big enough to cater to all of us.  We stayed at the Flamingo & took a taxi over - about a 10 minute ride.  It was a Tuesday night around 9pm I believe by the time we got there & there were literally 5 or 6 other patrons inside.  Waiter who greeted us was very friendly, younger, fun, just the kind of waiter we needed since we are a loud & crazy group.    Me & the other friend who decided on this restaurant are semi-knowledgeable on our Thai cuisine - so we knew we would be critical when it came time to eat. Waiter recommended the phuket-tini for a drink = a mojito-style martini.  All 6 of us got one and we could have probably all ordered 3 or 4 more, they were amazing.  We started off with cucumber salad, eggrolls and chicken satay as appetizers.  I ordered the Thai spicy beef salad (which I know as yum nua), others ordered the panang curry, sizzling black pepper beef, pad thai, pad prik and the honey walnut shrimp.  It was so good that we all ended up sharing off of everyone's plate.  There was not one complaint about the food.  By the time we were done, there was only 1 other couple in there and it was getting late.  The waiter was very prompt and attentive.  We ended up splitting the bill since all of our food was around the same price plus our drink.  We each spent $30 which was drink, appetizer, entree.  It was by far the best meal we had over the entire 3 days we spent in Vegas.    I would definitely recommend Satay.  It's nice to get out of the hustle & bustle of the strip...and if you're into Thai food they have a great menu at a good price.  Definitely will return if and when I get back to the city!",

This is not a night sleep? Its a nap??? I woke up feeling ever so hungry and craving for some laksa.  I hit Yelp almost instantly after waiting for a bloody 5 minutes for my computer to reboot, I dont have apple hallo??? So, I woke up, hair still messy, tummy still hungry and hit yelp while calling my fiancee.  Hallo fi fi!!! Where are you??? Oh still at work, good, Am coming over there and we are going to satay thai bistro and bar ok, am craving for laksa!! wHAT? U dont know Laksa? Dont worry!!! U gonna love it.  If those yelpers is right then I should get at least half decent laksa thats not as original as singapore or malaysian one. It should still satisfy my craving.  We arrived at 10.50. The place is going to close at 11.00!!! oh my what can I do?? So I said I am going to get it to go lah. Cos I crave for it remember? But the waitress are so nice, she said that she will stay open for another 30 minutes if I want to eat there. My fiancee want to eat there.  I hate being a last customer in the restaurant, seriously, I know how sucks it is. I used to be in the service industry, I know.  But we decided to stay because they let us and because my fiancee call the shot on this kind of stuff. LOL. Anyway, we ordered laksa and char gway teow. OMG. Those item are to die for. I absolutely clean the plates although I dont clear the soup cos its too much curry and fat. But the dish are delicious and we get in and out in 20 minutes.   Thank you satay thai bistro for staying open for us and for providing good service. WE are forever your loyal patron. I will absolutely bring more friends and relatives whenever possible!!!

The atmosphere is cool, casual, they play contemporary hip-hop and have video projectors. Part of the resturaunt is like a den.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is cause the service was a bit jinky and our appetizer was unappetizing. We got satay and it was fatty and chewy and way too gnarly to eat in my opinion.

We were thinking of what to munch on and I heard that they have Chicken and Waffles now at Satay and that it's some seriously proper chicken. Unfortunately that is a late night special on Fri&Sat  (see separate biz review- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chicks-waffles-and-burgers-las-vegas#query:chicken%20and%20waffle\">yelp.com/biz/chicks-waff...</a> ) so I didn't get to try, but I'm all good with Satays regular food.   As we were sitting, one of our company said that they wrote a review for a past experience and management wrote her an email about her experience and hope that they can change it into a positive. I know, it didn't happen to me, but I respect them for that.  Just wanted to say kudos for that...most places don't care and some businesses go out of the way to tell the customer that the customer is wrong!  They seem to care about their business and the email sounded polite, professional yet still sincere.  The BF and I got some Honey Walnut Shrimp- I know, you can get this just about everywhere but we were just craving it okay? The shrimp was fresh so all is good. Also got the Lamb curry which had very soft meat and nice spices....a tad too salty even with rice, but still it was decent. We got a salt and pepper fried tofu and it was lovely since it was crunchy outside and inside it was still very soft and melty even. I took bites out of everyones yummies....I liked the Tom Kha one friend ordered.   Service was very friendly and attentive tonight.   Overall, after a few times going here, I like this place. It's a far off place to go out of my way to come eat often, but when I'm out about town and need some late night goods, it's on my list for this side of town. Definitely I will be back for chicken and waffles soon!",

I've had better authentic dishes elsewhere.   The place was not kid friendly at all. We went here with our 20 month old and it felt like the servers wasn't aware we only had 30 or so minutes to eat and go. They were really laid back and took their time to attend and check there guess. Also, the eating area was very quiet, if your kid screams or fusses, everyone will literally turn their heads and the music will stop.   Overall, I don't recommend this place for anyone taking their kids here. Place has a more dating atmosphere and are generally for people that aren't aware of good Asian food. I think would of rated this place a 3 star if the servers were a little more attentive.",

    "text": "We were inside the restaurant on a Friday night. All the action was on the patio, with girls screaming every several minutes or so over the loud beats. The interior was dead when we arrived, save for 2-3 guys hanging out at the bar. We ordered thai iced coffee to start, which was good, but not phenomenal.   The interior is nice, with brick walls and well executed decorations. The bar is off the side from the main dining area, with the exit to the patio and bathrooms located on the opposite end from where we were seated. The party outside was really loud, and the music was even louder. They were playing largely hip hop and my boyfriend really didn't enjoy listening to it while trying to eat.  For food, we ordered the Buddha fresh spring roll, an order of the combo satay and the spicy red curry to finish. Our appetizers came out quickly, but not long after that that point another large group came in and they dominated the restaurant's attentions for the remainder of the evening.   Our curry took at least 15, if not 20, minutes to come out while we sat and finished our coffees, our appetizers, and just sat there trying in vain to communicate over the really loud music. Our waitress had time to count her tips and chat with one of the other waitresses before everyone was distracted for the next 20 minutes. We ordered a Singha, which was forgotten, so after waiting a while we got it from another server who was rushing around.  We watched as a table of \"invisible customers\" a few seats down from us was filled with multiple different steaming plates of food while we were waiting on our curry. Eventually 2 people sat there, one who looked like they were probably the owner and the other his friend. The owner-looking fellow talked to the other group in the room & the waitstaff while ignoring us as we sat there unhappy.    The Food: The Buddha Fresh Spring roll was medicore. Small bites of shrimp with tons and tons of cabbage. No real texture interest, no real flavor of any kind- just lots of raw cabbage and chewy rice paper. Served with a really sticky, peanut-laced sauce.   The Satay were better. Several skewers of different types of meat, they were still tender and slid off the sticks easily enough to avoid puncturing yourself.  After waiting so long, the curry didn't really satisfy us. It was definitely spicy, but didn't have much going on in the background. It was all heat in the beginning and wimper at the end. I liked the vibrant red color of it and the fresh herbs, but otherwise it was just OK. There wasn't a strong coconut flavor to it, which disappointed J quite a bit. We had been expecting more of a traditional thai style curry, while I'm guessing this may have been more Malaysian. I ate mine because I was hungry but J left his unfinished.  We had it with the coconut rice, which helped bring some coconut flavor to the picture, but not a ton. It was moist rice, but a small portion- roughly an upturned bowl for us to share. It was definitely not enough for the entire bowl and all the sauce.    When we were about to go, we asked to have all of our food boxed up. Our waitress disappeared with the food and then returned to go chat with the other customers. We stood around waiting until she was finished, but when that took too long, we asked another server where our food was. She'd thrown it away. Oh, thanks! It was easily half the meal still. I'm assuming she couldn't hear me because the music was SO loud!  We got another batch made up quickly, which made up for it- but also made us wonder why it took so long the first time.   I don't like yelling over the music while trying to enjoy a nice meal out, nor do I enjoy being blatantly ignored or given biased treatment while out to eat. It's understandable to me that there's more motivation to kiss up to the large groups because of the higher chance of a good tip, but you never know in this town who'll be the best tipper.   Overall- you're paying for atmosphere. Go at happy hour, grub out and drink some tasty sounding drinks. Don't go after midnight for food unless you're going to be partying on the patio or with a large enough group for them to really care.",

    "text": "Good flavorful (though slightly heavy/oily) thai/Malaysian food. Had dinner here with two friends, while waiting to catch our respective flights back. The location made it convenient (2-3 miles from the airport) and it showed up with a high rating on yelp (something our server took pride in :) ).  Overall the food was quite good, if a touch oily/heavy. Our server was excellent, willing to take last minute adjustments to our food and he knew the menu, was able to make meaningful suggestions without overdoing it. Will totally visit again, next time I'm in Vegas :).  + Tom Yum Soup : average, nothing out of the ordinary, but not bad either. Had a spicy level of seven, that made us change our minds and alter the rest of your meal for 5s and 6s :). That kinda made me happy, I've seen enough \"americanized\" thai places were even a ten doesnt make you flinch.  + Fresh Coconut water : both my friends had some. Both liked it, freshly cut and sweet according to them.  + Green Curry : always the safe choice at most Thai places :), was good. The tofu chunks were nice, the gravy fairly tasty. All that I'd expect from a good Thai green curry, without really blowing me away.   + Narsi Goreng : good. A little oily and the egg wasnt done well enough.  + Crispy noodles with Chicken breasts : friend ordered this and was most definitely the best thing we had at our table that day. Very tasty gravy/broth which melded quite well with the crispy noodles. (I hadnt seen this preparation/dish for a long time, and it reminded me of similarly awesome preparation I had back in my home town six or seven years ago. I was grateful for the little gastronomic  trip down memory lane!)  - Slightly pricy I guess : $75 without alcohol for the three of us. - The woman refilling the water seemed ridiculously un-interested in getting us any water. It arrived 10-15 mins after we had been seated, despite repeated requests :| - Could have done with a little less oil :(",

Not great, but good. The menu is huge. I ordered the Panang Curry Chicken, Roti flatbread, and Satay beef skewers. All were solid, and the prices were very reasonable.  Not a bad choice if you are in the area and in the mood for Thai or Malasian food.",

Very tender and you didn't have to wrestle them off the skewers. Very tasty and tender, great seasoning and you can't do wrong with peanut sauce. The roti, as recommended by my bartender-server, was also tasty with the curry sauce dip (but also great with the peanut sauce from the satay). I've had roti before and loved it. Its almost pastry-like, crisply multi-layered like greek phyllo but more stretchy. This particular one was more greasy than I would like. I'll ask for that adjustment next time and it should be perfect. Its almost like the Malay version of chips and salsa. I caught the chef spying on me from the kitchen to make sure I liked his food. That was pretty cute. Haha.   Looks like they have a cool lounge scene for evenings, too. Comphy modern low couches set up in a very social layout. Totally chill-worthy.   I'll be back for sure. Service was great and prices also look very good for Vegas.",

The food was very fresh, colorful and flavorful. When you walk in, it's very clean and the smells from different spices linger in the room. It's not your ordinary restaurant with weekend djs and the bar has a great mix of drinks and fresh infusions of fruits and liquors.  So here's the deal. The food is good. For the price - reasonable- but worth the effort.  The lettuce wraps, trendy and delicious....Pad thai was pretty good as well. They have a great selection in their menu.

For the main dish, we asked the the server for his recommendation for a good Malaysian dish and he suggested the Rendeng (Beef Curry) so we said, what the hey...this only one of a a few Malaysian dishes we spotted on the menu.  The food was just fair.  The roti was normal with a runny curry dipping sauce.  The coconut rice was okay, fluffy with coconut flavor.  The beef tasted okay and was tender but looked like a pile of poo.    The prices were a little above average and the service was good but why shouldn't it be if there are no customers.

I think around $15. However, during the weekends it gets extremely busy (I waited an hour for a group of 3 people). They did not have a waiting system established either.   Now the food is really good and their menu is extensive. I believe they mix-in Chinese food options, but do not quote me on this. They also give you options of Tofu & Veggie, Chicken, Beef, Pork for each menu item (how amazing is that!). They also have white rice, coconut rice, and brown rice options. Here are my favorites menu items:  Singapore fried noodles with Tofu: slightly crispy, thin version of Chow Mien. Delicious! Pad Prik Khing (any meat, I have yet to try the Tofu version): Crispy green beans in a oily-spicy sauce with your choice of meat! Thai Style Rice: Extremely sticky patty of rice, very good when served warm (it stays soft for a bit). Veggie Delight: Mixed vegetables and tofu in a light soy sauce gravy. Add a little Sriracha and there is no sacrifice for choosing the healthy option!",

    "text": "THANK YOU again, Yelpers -- was looking for a good Thai for takeout not too far off, and Satay Thai popped up. Was actually glad it was a takeout pick-up 'cuz it was almost all guys in there (after 9 pm) and mostly at the bar. The Tom Ka Gai was a teensy bit oversalted, but otherwise just galangal-icious! Pad Thai with chicken & shrimp also  very good. They do prepare to American tastes, which is to say if you want any spiciness in one of these often-sweet dishes, TELL THEM when you order. Jasmine rice: nice aroma, will go well in my soup tomorrow. The other thing I loved? Change back from my 20. 'Course the bartender was so personable it didn't matter: 'scuse me, while I tip this guy!",

The guy gives me a small cup (for the price, especially when I can get a huge cup for the same price in LA) and hands me back $16 instead of the $16 plus change that I should have received. I go back in and ask him about my change. He fiddles around and tells me he owes me 10 cents because he doesn't have it.   This is bad business. Do I care about the 10 cents? Of course not. But if you don't have the change don't shortchange me first, then when you get called out about it still shortchange me. What he should have done was given me too much money rather than cheat a customer. He could have said sorry I don't have the change first. I don't care how good your food is or how good the tea was, I won't be returning. Who knows how many customers they do this to.",

I don't think anyone is going to walk away saying that the food is bad nor is anyone going to walk away saying that this is as good as it gets in Thai food.  It's a great place to go if you are tired of the Strip prices and Strip mediocre quality or just living locally and want a quick quality Asian meal.  We were staying off the strip doing some business and Yelpers helped us find this place when we were very hungry, it was getting late, and we were on the way back to the hotel.    I had Chicken with Vegetables and Brown Rice.  It was all good and I could return for the same.  The chicken tasted fresh, no aftertaste, like we have encountered in other Thai places.  Service was \"matter of fact\" and efficient.  Atmosphere is casual--not really a romantic dating environment--more for friends get together, established couples, or family or dining alone.   Prices are reasonable for the area.  Parking is free and easy.  We would return again next time in the area.",

Jasmine, coconut, and brown rice selections are offered, and the entree is served with a side salad.   At a spicy level 5, the curry packed enough heat where I wasn't sweating my butt off. Compared to other panang curries I've eaten, this one contains plenty of chicken and minimal bell peppers. Brown rice was perfectly cooked. The side salad was basic iceberg lettuce with a bland dressing.  Service wasn't attentive. Once the food arrived, the server never visited to ask how the food tasted and didn't refill my beverage. At least the food made up for this aspect of the restaurant.",

We have been to Satay before but it's been several years and upon entering this time it was immediately impressive. The upgrades they have done were very tasteful. We were immediately greeted and shown to our table for two. We ordered chicken pad prik king and Thai basil. The food came out quickly, although we didn't mind, as the atmosphere was very pleasant, music was a nice mix and at the perfect level so we could still carry on a conversation. Both dishes were very well prepared, although I would have to say I preferred the prik king over the Thai basil. Both dishes came with a choice of white, coconut or brown rice.   I would definitely eat here again, although it will probably still be only when our other favorite is closed!",

We were seated behind a couple who was kinda loud, (first date I think) it was also VERY cold inside, they had the AC and fans on blast. It wasn't even close to 100 degrees outside. Waiter, finally came back about 15 mins later, asked for our drink order.. I ordered a Pepsi, it was flat. I let it slide  I ordered the Crab Rangoon for an app. They were amazing!!! Yum! For my entree I ordered Spicy Thai Basil, and my friend ordered the Tiger Steak. Food arrived, everything was hot & fresh. My meal was great, my friend also thought so about hers too. The service was overall VERY slow, young guys just messing around. By the time we were done eating, the restaurant was empty, still waiting for our check and the guys were still goofing off. I mean c'mon, don't get me wrong they were very nice but they lack a little professionalism. Will I return? Probably.... maybe for take out though!",

You could taste the basil and if you like spice, dip your fries in the chili sauce. The vegan egg rolls were nice and crispy as well and not mushy. You could readily identify every vegetable in the roll and it also paired well with either the sauce it came with or the chili sauce. Although I do not eat meat, my friends got the chili chicken wings and they smelled amazing.  On my second visit, I tried the curry samosas and the flavor was a savory blend of curry, potatoes, onions, and carrots. I am not sure what the chutney dip was that's served with this, but it was sweet and I definitely used all of it. I also shared the Pad Woon Sen with my friend and we had it made with tofu and it was just the right amount if you are sharing and getting an appetizer. The best part of the entire meal was the dessert! I am normally not a big fan of mango any other way than freshly sliced...until I tried the mango sticky rice. The mango, sauce, and sticky rice was delicious and was a light finish to a great meal.",

If you like curry, the samosas are a must have appetizer. I've enjoyed every dish I've had here, from the Mongolian tofu to the Singapore noodles.   If you are vegan and get a lunch combo, ask for them to substitute peanut sauce for dressing on the salad.  They are flexible and accommodate small changes on the menu. Our servers have always been fun and friendly!   They place great music and it's a great place to decompress during one's lunch break, especially with coworkers.  In short, good food, good atmosphere, reasonable prices, and they can meet the needs of diverse dietary requirements. This place is superior to Komol in Commercial Center, which is my normal go-to place for Thai food. It is absolutely worth the trip.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Fairfield Inn next door for a one night layover at the airport. We decided that some Asian food sounded good so we stopped by.  We had two episodes of \"Mad Men\" on Netflix to watch - so we wanted to get in and out of there. We figured out that we wanted to share roti canai, spring rolls, pad see ew, and some rice. We placed the order immediately for the whole thing, and we told the waitress that she could just bring it all out at the same time.  About 45 minutes, we got it all at the same time. She was very apologetic, and she complimented my girlfriend for having a \"pretty face\" at least 3 times, so that makes the wait more palatable I suppose!  As for the food itself, it was not bad. The roti canai was delicious, actually. I definitely recommend this as a great starter to share. The pad see ew was not as good as some other places I have been, but the spring rolls were piping hot and delicious.  All in all, this place is fine. It's clean, and the food is average or better. The service is lacking, though (it was not crowded when we were there). If you're staying at one of the smaller hotels in the area and want some low key Asian food that is fairly priced, this is a good option. If you're not in the area or want something better, then skip.",

Satay was so nice to stay open for me because usually around this time lots of kitchens start shutting down and start cleaning for the next day. I actually felt that I had the entire restaurant to myself(well actually, I did, lol!) They were so kind to allow me to make a last minute order and to stay open for me to dine in. Now lets talk about the food. I ordered the Beef Satay sticks, Drunken noodles, Beef Pad Thai, and Papaya salad w/ Grilled Shrimp. One word, delicious! Everything came out in a timely fashion and everything was great. The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was very attentive. I definitely plan on going back to try more food soon hopefully before the 12AM closing time.",

I've been here more times than I can count and I have only had good service once and that was because the owner herself was taking care of me due to some party.  Today I went and misjudged my party's size instead of being a three top we became a six top. The girl rolled her eyes and looked pissed that I needed a bigger table. If it was slammed I could understand but we were the only table in the restaurant. It took the two servers over ten minutes to get me a water, my friends had to ask for their drinks three times. On the third time they actually went to the bar and asked for the beers. The shocker in all this we were the only table. Being in the industry myself I could understand beers/waters taking awhile but being the only freaking table in the whole restaurant it's just ridiculous. I'm about at my limit with this restaurant but I'm addicted to their Pad Thai and Panang Curry.  I just want the service to be better I feel like their servers could care less about their jobs. I just want it fixed so that I can love this place.",

It's at a price point that I can afford to eat at on a regular basis and if it weren't across town for me, I'd be here even more.  Favorite Foods:  Beef Satay - The chicken satay is good too, but I'm a beef lover.  It has a slightly sweet flavor goes well as an appetizer or paired with the combination fried rice.  Bacon Wrapped Scallops - Bacon. Scallops.  BACON!!!!  Beef Rendang - Its a curried type beef, but what makes it amazing is that it's short rib. Short rib, marinaded and slow cooked with tons of flavor.  Apparently you can order it spicy, but I hate all things spice (I'm convinced spicy things undermine my taste-bud's ability to appreciate beef).  Combination Fried Rice - Chicken, bbq pork, shrimp, egg.  Perfect balance of saltiness with flavors.    Lemongrass Chicken - I believe it's roasted chicken. Lemongrass with a slight sweetness  Garlic Green Beans - Garlic, green beans, butter, garlic.  On a gluttony day, I order all of the above and make 1.5 meals out of it.",

Luckily, Satay is down the street from work so I got here very fast and walked in to see Misti Y. and her husband Bobby working their tails off to set up!  Yelpers enjoyed the whole patio, and tables were sprinkled with Yelpilicious items, including buttons, chapstick (see my Yelp Career Fair Review for my excitement over chapstick), bottle-opener keychains, and Yelp madlib bar napkins.  I was able to meet a large number of rather awesome Yelpers so it I probably shouldn't name names, but I was so happy to finally meet some \"regulars\" aka Matthew C., Raymond B., and Blair B. whose reviews I really admire *blush*  The food was yummy - a smorgasbord of satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad, spicy hot wings with raw jalepenos (love those suckers), crab rangoons, roti with curry sauce, samosas, edamame and veggie eggrolls.  We also enjoyed Singha beer towers (those things are enormous!)  I had to rely on Bobby's beer \"pouring\" skills for a full glass.  I also tried an Asian pear/sake cocktail with a cucumber (delicious).  Misti Y. named a cocktail the \"Yelpish Red\" and it was enjoyed by all.  Satay really set us up with a good deal - their happy hour is $3 appetizers, $3 house wines, $5 martinis and tropical cocktails/Yelpish Red Special drink, $24 beer towers, etc.  Our bartender was awesome and he set up Santana on a giant sound system outside.  Jay-son who I believe owns/manages Satay checked on us, mingled, and gave us all coupons for our next visit.  I had a great time and definitely would return to check out the rest of the menu.  I peeked inside and the interior is very nice.  I have to say that the peanut sauce and the raw jalepenos rocked my world.  I think I scared Blair B.'s husband a bit when he saw me down a few raw jalepenos - but I never claimed to be normal! :)  Can't wait for the next one!!!",

A hip, fun place to hang out but with tasty food and drinks that will keep me coming back. Prices are quite reasonable, particularly for the quality. The Happy Hour has been mentioned a lot on Yelp - and for good reason. A Happy Hour that doesn't end until 8 PM? Freaking SWEET.   We sampled many of the appetizer-esque foods - satays, wontons, and chicken wings. All were incredibly tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken wings . Forget BW3 - come here for your chicken wing fix. The sweet glaze with just a touch of heat was perfect.Their namesake satays were also a winner! The glaze on them was perfect and no chewy meat here.   We were so happy with the appetizers we ordered a half duck ($14) from the menu. We were given a choice of many delish sounding rices (jasmine, coconut, white, brown) and went with the coconut. The duck was perfect - moist with beautiful crisp skin and the coconut rice was amazing. It wasn't  the sticky dessert type rice you get at most places - it was white rice with just a perfect subtle coconut flavor. If only they gave me a bucket of that rice - I might have been able to finish it !   Great owner, great beer (who doesn't like drinking beer out of freaking cool towers?), great patio, great food.. definitely recommend it for locals and tourists alike. We're going into patio season - take advantage !",

All the staff is very friendly and helpful too.  Not to mention they have great Happy Hour deals too - check it out!  Oh, that reminds me - their samosas (not that I'd typically order samosas at a Thai place, but they were on happy hour) are delicious!",

For the entrees we got Orange chicken, Green curry and the Honey walnut shrimp. Every single thing we ordered was amazing. I was really impressed with the lemongrass soup though, super delicious and the right amount of spice in it. We also loved the potstickers so much that at the end of our meal we got two more orders of it because they were so amazing! I don't know how anything didn't like the food here because we were all impressed.",

I think the lunch crowd knows that this place isn't the place to go for a quick in-and-out lunch.   Honestly, I would love to give Satay five stars but until they get more attentive I just can't.",

    "text": "I've been a repeat customer since my first visit here--late night post-drinking eats--and have yet to be disappointed after each visit (lunch, dinner, more post-drinking meals).  I was definitely surprised when my boyfriend took me here (instead of Firefly), and I realized what I'd been missing out on for quite some time.    With the exception of anything extremely spicy (definitely can't handle that with my sensitive stomach), I've enjoyed quite a bit of the menu.  I've had the following:   Mango Tofu -  Iused to order this a lot until I realized what I was missing when it came to eating BEEF.  Still a pretty tasty alternative, and large enough portions that if you eat this alone, you could probably still manage to take some home   Lemongrass Chicken - Pretty tasty and one of my favorites.  The first time I had this dish, I almost finished it all by myself.  Lol.  Teriyaki Chicken - delicious  Thai BBQ Pork Spareribs - I snatched one of these from a friend's plate and he almost bit my fingers off.  Haha.  He, on the other hand, demolished the rest of the ribs and seriously kept gnawing at the rest of the meat on the bone, cherishing every bite.  Beef Rendang - Tender, full of flavor, and another favorite dish that I've had from time to time.  I can't say that I've been disappointed whenever I've eaten this dish.  Even though it's marked as spicy on the menu, we were able to have the spice level taken down, thankfully.    Yakitori Chicken Satay - I generally tend to get an order of these each time that I eat here.  The chicken is tender, but I really like the dipping sauce a lot more, in addition to the accompaniments--cucumber and onion.  Black Pepper Beef - I also like this dish.  Yes, I seem to like a lot of meat dishes, but with pepper and beef, I figured you couldn't really go wrong.    Brown Rice - standard brown rice  Coconut Rice - Pretty yummy, although I don't really eat rice.  It's different, though--sweet, but still rice.  Thai Sticky Rice - This is another dish that I have tried, but is an acquired taste, as I am not really partial to rice.  Vegetable Spring Roll - Another basic staple that I order when I eat here.  Even though it's your standard fresh roll, the sauce is delicious, and the freshness is hard to beat.  Har Gow - what you would typically find when going out for dim sum  Pad See Ew - LOVE this dish.  Noodles, eggs, broccoli, soy sauce = yummy.  I tend to just grab a tiny bit of this, but usually end up eating half, if not 3/4 of the entire dish. Lol.  House Fried Rice - This is one of the few rice dishes that I will willingly eat, especially with some extra Garlic.  YUM.  Thai Garlic Chicken - Chicken breast with garlic upon garlic?  Obviously I am a fan.   Hainan Chicken - I like this as a healthy alternative, mainly because this is steamed.  I also think that the sesame soy sauce helps bring out the tenderness of the chicken, as well as the full flavor.  Be prepared, though, that this is a HUGE dish.  Thai Garlic Beef - Beef, garlic sauce, and garlic?  Again, a fan of this dish.   Mango Sticky Rice - my boyfriend's definitely a fan of this dessert, as he loves rice, sweets, and mango.  Delicious, delicious, delicious.  I can't help but talk about how much of this menu I love.  In addition, the service is great (I've eaten with larger parties of 10 to smaller parties of 2) and they're quite attentive, friendly, and helpful when it comes to suggestions and refills.  My only problem is that the lot gets packed at night, so plan accordingly (the plaza shares a parking lot with Firefly, Ruth's Chris, and other restaurants/businesses.  I will say, though, that I've enjoyed coming here--whether to grab a bite after going out, enjoying a quick lunch, sitting on the patio and listening to the DJ spin or even just sitting indoors and enjoying the company of friends/family/my significant other--despite the reason.  Can't wait to come back...",

The kra prow / spicy basil chicken stir fry was delicious and they will customize the spice level to your liking.  The service was great - I definitely recommend Satay.",

Taking a tables order who sat before me and haven't even asked for my drink order is plain rude. This has happened on a number of times. Once ok maybe I let slide but a few times after is ridiculous. Also service is slow. There have been occasion when my coworkers and I end up coming back to work late from lunch because they took forever to get our bill and food took longer than needed to come out. For any restaurant food should take average 15 mins to come out unless noted or advised by wait staff. Now the food. It's bleh. As I have said before it does not amaze. They have gone through a few menu changes since I've first been here. Sorry but I'd rather drive a little further and get better tasting thai food and better service. ..maybe if you are white they might be more attentive...just saying while observing you can tell  they prefer certain colors better.",

We arrived when Happy Hour was still going on so we ordered some appetizers from the menu at a discount. We got the Thai nachos and the Lumpai--both were excellent. The wife got lamb curry for the entree and loved it. The sauce was flavorful and spicy, the lamb super tender. I got the Malaysian satay with dark chicken meat. It was very juicy and not at all dry. I liked it a lot, one of the best satays I have had. I also had a small house salad and the carrot dressing was excellent. Don't be put off by the  location off the strip, this place is a better value and the food is way better than the corporate chains on the strip. I would return here in a heartbeat.",

So fresh, flavorful and that dipping sauce that goes with it! Fantastic....Next I had the Pad See Ew with Chicken/ Shrimp Combination. Yesssss! It was Amazing! Again the flavors are there my ingredients were fresh and I loved every minute I was there! Last but not least I had to get dessert to go there was no way I could fit it in but I had to have they had a few things I wanted to try but I took the deep fried banana fitters home with ice cream and some sauce. Let's just say this place will not disappoint. Everything I tried down to the Iced Coffee almost forgot to mention that was Outstanding. Thank you Team and staff!",

    "text": "Unimpressive Thai food.  I ordered the Tom Yum Soup (Thai hot and sour soup) and the Chicken Pad Thai.  The soup was bland and had an overload of mushrooms. I love mushrooms but in a bland soup where the mushroom also has no flavor, it's a bit of an overkill... I took a few bites before setting it aside.   When my Pad Thai came out, it looked delicious! Unfortunately, it didn't taste as good as it looked. It was pretty dry and hard to chew, so I ended up adding in a few spoonfuls of my Tom Yum soup to break apart the noodles and make it easier to eat. Sad to say, I didn't finish this either nor take it home.   The server we had was nice though! He was both working at the bar and serving tables. He's the only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star.   I will not be back because of the food, and do not recommend this place for good Thai food.",

Portions were perfect. Not too much, not too little.   We came in for lunch and the service was attentive and friendly. The restaurant wasn't too busy so it was a nice, chill ambiance. Most of us ordered from the Lunch Special menu.   I enjoyed my L3 Spicy Basil with beef and coconut rice. It was wok-fried with green beans, bell peppers, & basil leaves. Yum! And washed it down with a Thai Iced Coffee. You can choose your level of heat (1-10) on most of the dishes and i enjoyed a level 5 for my dish. I may try a 7 or 8 next time.",

    "text": "I'm just writing this review based on the chili fried chicken because it's probably the best fried chicken from an Asian restaurant I've ever had. Yes, customer service was great, and I did order mediocre honey walnut and shrimp and Mongolian beef, but the fried chicken is to die for which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars!!!! The texture of the chicken is so pristine; it's crunchy with every bite you take. The chili sauce adds to the chicken to give it an immaculate taste. I loved the sauce so much I found myself dipping my broccoli from my honey walnut shrimp into it and eating it. You guys need to come to the Bay Area because I for sure would be there all the time just to order the fried chicken!! I don't know how popular this place is in Vegas for locals but it deserves to get recognized for their amazing fried chicken!!  *request to owners: can you guys brighten the restaurant little bit? I wasn't a big fan of reading the menu under a dim light where I was seated. Thanks!",

Calling in an order for delivery is not accepted here. So i took the advice of the restaurant to use Grub Hub. Upon ordering online and checking everything appropriately the food delivered was not as ordered online. My poor review has to do with the fact that the restaurant won't take responsibility for sending the meal with egg in it when specifically asked not to include it. Severe allergy was the main reason we chose this place. They can not deliver now so no dinner. How unfortunate to have spent this sort of money to feed a small army and all to find out we can not have a new dish delivered the way it was meant to have been prepared. Simple request. It's listed under vegan options. We took extra measures to make notation on the order and call it in for confirmation. The Cook didn't check it nor did whomever packaged it up for delivery. Even if the food is good, I don't gather the owners or staff care to pay attention to the order or assist when it is done incorrectly.",

Best peanut sauce i have ever had...poured it over everything we got including the chicken potstickers. The mango sticky rice was to die for.

    "text": "Satay is a great Thai restaurant that I frequent, mostly because of its convenient location (aka conveniently next to my job). The service has never been less than satisfying as the staff is very friendly, and I've never had an unusually long wait to get my food when dining in. They also do take out if you call. :)  They also offer lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11am to 4pm. The portions are also slightly smaller compared to the entree size, but it does comes with a side of the house salad/rice. The price is cheaper as well to reflect this and to be completely honest, I think the portions are perfect for lunch size. The regular entree portion always equals leftovers for me.  - Pad Thai 9/10 I love the pad thai here. This is also offered as a lunch special, yay! Not much to say other than this restaurant's pad thai does not suck.  - Pad See Ew 9/10 Also a great dish if you're a fan of flat rice noodles. This comes cooked w/ Chinese broccolli and your choice of meat. Not offered as a lunch special.  - House salad 5/10 Not a huge fan tbh. Sauce is okay and I like the touch with the egg, but I'm just not a huge fan of it. I do eat it all when I get it as a side with my lunch special but I would not order it. They offer this in a small and large size and honestly the small is a good portion.  - Nasi Goreng 10/10 I would consider this my absolute favorite dish from Satay! It's a fried rice dish -- which says a lot since I'm not a huge fan of fried rice -- with shrimp, squid, tofu with fried egg. Not sure what it is about this dish but I am a fan and would not hesitate to try it again! They only offer this as a dinner portion so it's fairly large.  Overall, price point is a teeny bit higher than other local Thai restaurants, but their food does not disappoint!",

    "text": "When we arrived we got seated fairly quickly. I ordered the Orange chicken and asked to have a side of regular fried rice instead of the options they had (which were jasmine, coconut rice) the waiter told me that wasn't an option because they only give fried rice in big batches. I didn't want to have to order a full plate of fried rice so I chose plain jasmine white rice. The orange chicken was ok, super crunchy and kinda of dry (lacked sauce) ambience was somewhat relaxing but overall this place is somewhere I probably wouldn't go to again. It was a nice try for Thai food. 3/5",

    "text": "Decent HH specials, full bar available, patio seating out front. Inside looks like it was once some sort of cantina, but menu is full Thai. I appreciate that they have several apps and small plate options.  GARLIC BASIL FRIES were topped with a few basil leaves but no garlic whatsoever. Extremely disappointed, as they were the item I was most excited about. They weren't even decent fries, they were overly greasy, limp, and unseasoned. FRESH BUDDHA ROLLS are giant spring rolls wrapped in rice paper, good value at $5, add shrimp for a dollar more otherwise this is a pointless order.  Majority of filling is browning iceberg lettuce with some basil. Confused about why the order comes with such a miniscule amount of peanut sauce- the cup was literally less than a third full. Not worth getting without adding the shrimp SALT AND PEPPER SHRIMP: Shrimp did not seem the freshest, no salt and pepper present in the order. Shrimp seemed leftover and reheated with mushy breading, a few sliced fresh jalapenos were thrown on top.   Tossed 2 of the 3 items I ordered. Probably would not come back. I suggest going during HH if you simply have to try it out for yourself.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon Satay after searching for Chinese restaurants here on Yelp. It's a blessing that it showed up on the search results because I have also been looking for a decent place near my home that sells good curry. Satay met all those criteria.  As far as food goes, their menu is extensive. They serve Malaysian, Chinese, and Thai dishes. The menu has pictures of each dish and details whether dishes are vegetarian or gluten free. The drink selection is also great.   I ordered the yellow curry with chicken breast and a side of jasmine rice. Everything was served hot and fresh. The curry was sweet with a tinge of spiciness: just the way I like it. My husband ordered the curry laksa: noodles, chicken, fish, and veggies in a spicy curry broth. He enjoyed it, but it was on the spicier side. His stomach bothered him for a little while after dinner. I personally recommend getting a side of rice with the curry laksa to tone done the spiciness. For an appetizer, we ordered garlic basil fries. Delicious. My husband and I both agree that the food here is different than we can get anywhere in our proximity and everything tasted excellent. If you're looking for something new, go here!  I also wanted to make a note about the atmosphere of this restaurant. They had an active fire pit outside that is warm and welcoming. It was unexpected. The warm and welcoming feeling extends to the inside with the dim lights and music selection. This place is great for families and dates alike. The service was also fast and friendly. The staff was really on top of filling our drinks and checking up on us. That's always a plus.  Overall, I was very impressed with Satay. I'm just disappointed that my stomach couldn't eat everything on the menu! Haha. I will definitely be returning so I can try some more.",

    "text": "I came here on one serendipitous evening when a group of us just finished watching some boxing at The Joint in the Hard Rock Casino and our hunger would not allow us to wait 45 minutes outside of Firefly.  Therefore we decided to walk across the street to check out Satay Thai.   Upon perusing the menu, I was a bit skeptical since there was a hodgepodge of pan-asian selections ranging from the standards (thai curries, chinese stir-frys, and malaysian/indonesian classics such as beef rendang and mee goreng) to the bizarre such as thai nachos (shrimp chips topped with ceviche) and \"chinese\" chicken which reminded me of  the Barenaked Ladies' song \"One Week\" (chickity china the chinese chicken?!)   However, what jumped out at me since I almost never see it offered anywhere was the Curry Laksa.  If you have ever been to Singapore or seen a show devoted to the food hawkers there, you will no doubt recognize this is the dish to try and there are heated rivalries as to who makes the best version.  Essentially this is a fusion noodle soup from Chinese/Malay cuisine consisting of either thick egg noodles or thin vermicelli rice noodles in a spicy curry coconut broth simmered with chicken, seafood such as minced fish meatballs, and fried tofu.  Here they give you the best of both noodles so I didn't mind the juxtaposition in texture and flavors although they didn't necessarily add the sambal belechan chili paste made from chilis and dried shrimps giving it that trademark grittiness derived from it's namesake (Laksa in chinese means \"spicy sand\").    Nonetheless on a cold wintery evening,  this rich, creamy, and spicy soup (they allow you to order the spice level from 1-10, I think 7 struck the perfect balance) gives you that cozy warm soup belly and the constant variation in flavors from all the individual components keeps every bite interesting down to the part where you are fishing for any final tasty remnants with your spoon.  The portion is substantial at a reasonable price ($9.95) and my parting advice is to be careful what you wear as you are slurping away.  At the end of my meal, I noticed a Jackson Pollock of curry on my dress shirt and I had to take it to the cleaners through two rounds to remove the stains, but it was worth the trouble since I would have otherwise missed out on this chance discovery.",

I am pregnant (8 months) and all I have been craving/eating lately is Thai food.   We celebrated Valentines Day last night (Sunday) as my fiance worked Saturday (Vegas-Life)! We decided To go here vs other places because we had had a good experience and of course because all I want is Thai and one closer to home is well \"less fancy\"  Upon entering we waited to be seated which was quick & I was able to pick where we could sit (a lil bit larger table than one just designed for two people) since we had our 16month old daughter with us.   It took them a while to get drink orders. I didn't mind because I did notice they were busy. Our waitress arrived right as we got done giving the order for drinks. Drinks arrived promptly. I had ordered garlic basil fries but with (no basil) few other items & Roti Canai.   I had loved roti Canai here before so I knew I would love it again.   Our order took a while again understandable since they were busy. In the mean time my very active bladder called and I when I got to the restroom I realised the bigger of the two stalls had no toilet paper!!!!! Seriously I don't care how busy you guys get keep toilet paper in restroom & clean it for goodness sake.  Upon returning the food had arrived and well the fries had basil on them. Smh. The Roti was undercooked and doughy. Wish I had taken pictures to post!!!!!   Our waitress said she will have them redo the fries and roti. I have a 16 month old who was hard enough to keep still the food going in and out of the kitchen was delaying her eating, & my eating. We had friends we had to meet up with after. Roti Canai went back twice and we just gave up. Fries did finally come but had no garlic nor garlic flavouring. Waitress waited till my drink was empty to refill. It was a disastrous experience  !!!!! I finally asked if they were busy and they said yes the magic convention was in town. Not an excuse for horrible service can't handle a crowd then please shut down!!!!!! We hated the entire experience and I wasn't shy to let them know. I even had to get up myself to go get napkins because of lack of service.   My fiance wondered if they had a manager on duty since no one had come to apologise for food being sent back multiple times. I told him not one person there looked like a manager and I doubt he/she was there. I was right. He/she wasn't.   Upon signing the check and of course I tipped just towards the low end (15%) I was asked was everything good I said NO and we didn't like the food or service. The guy assured me he would pick up our tab next visit....yeah I believed him (not).   Safe to say you guys ruined our Valentine's Day dinner for my daughter, my fiance (who kept apologising for their horrible service to me) and mine.   DO NOT GO HERE IF THEY ARE BUSY, apparently the wait staff and kitchen can't handle it.",

Ran out of water and the waiter was no where to be found until he brought the check.  Thankfully i get email alerts from my bank because not only were we charged for our bill, but for the other table's too. Waiter tried to give us some crappy excuse and the manager didn't seem to care.  Won't be going back.",

Iam very pleased to have tried this place. Their laksa is very good! Comparable to those i have had in singapore. We also got some stir fry noodles and they were awesome. In short, this place has good food and good ambience. I secretly asked Gina(their staff that day) if i can buy a dessert and have them put a candle on top of it for my sister in law and she said she would do it for free! Awesome! She's very sweet. The dessert we got was a sorbet topped with fruits and it was the bomb. They even sang happy birthday to my sister in law. If ever im in vegas again, im definitely coming back.",

Got incredibly sick and when my friend arrived she found me holed up in my hotel room subsisting on crackers.  She Yelped for the nearest vegetarian friendly restaurant and found this great Thai place.  Off she went to buy me real food.  Now I'm not sure what she got me but I do remember eating a great Thai veggie soup and coconut rice along with some fat noodle dish.  All was delish!  Memories of this restaurant were so strong that we returned almost a week later driving 3+ hours from Utah thinking about what we were going to order.   Try it.  You won't be disappointed.",

I believe his name was Daniel.  The checks got delivered without asking if we needed anything else.  It seemed that the waiter's phone required more attention.  We had to get the manager's attention to pick up the checks and bring a to-go container because we had to get back to the office.  For a lunch period, the speed of service is key.  I will need to think of this place twice as a lunch option.",

Beautiful atmosphere, with hookah lounge outside, great staff. The food looks great and taste better. Awesome Thai Iced Tea. Had Yellow Curry, Pad See Ew, Tom Kha (sp?) soup, and Samosas. Delicious. Highlight meal of the trip. Hidden gem just off the Vegas Strip.  The only negative I can think if is there was not a lot of noodles with the Pad See Ew. More chicken than noodles, but most may like this.",

There is also a hookah lounge on the other side of the restaurant and it looked like fun, as well.  I can't wait for another Vegas layover so I can come back here again.   I now must conclude this review, as I am getting starved thinking about Satay and I must go feed my face.",

Very flavorful and worth it. Not expensive and easy to park. Huge place that has plenty of seating. Probably a local favorite as it's off the strip and unassuming. The service is also pretty friendly. We asked for a hundred things from hot sauces to utensils to napkins and they happily obliged. Do it.",

Manager: okay...what would you like for entrees? Us: Why don't you just surprise us?  Bottom line: Great food, from appetizers, to entrees and dessert, to alcohol ! A little off the strip but worth a visit if you are craving for Thai/Chinese fusion food. The manager ordered the perfect amount for us and the food overall was 4/5! Service was great too!",

    "text": "After a very long night and long day in Vegas from bar hopping and going to a day club with my friends, we decided to dine at Satay Thai Bistro for dinner. We decided to order lots of food and share it family style. The amount of each dish was plentiful and flavorful.   Food:   Tom Yum Seafood Soup- The tang of the soup/ broth was just right. The size and the variety of seafood were good.    Crispy Tofu- The crispy tofu is offered as a small plate but there were many pieces. I'd say there were about 15-20 pieces of small tofu. Considering it's a small plate, the serving amount was very generous with a side of sweet and sour sauce!    Pad See Ew- Excellent in flavor! I was very surprised they used the Asian broccoli vs. the American broccoli. It's definitely brings out the authenticity of the flavor in the dish.       Green Curry- good combination of vegetables with meat with the good scent of coconut milk.   Mango Shrimp-  The balance of shrimp and mango with the flavor was well balanced. The shrimp size were fairly large too!    Service:   The staffs were attentive, quick at clearing plates, and refilling waters. Not only were they on top of their service but all smiles as well.   Parking:  A private lot with tons of parking available.   Price:  The prices are a little higher than what I am use to but the portion and serving sizes make up for that!  If you want a nice break from the the hustle and bustle of the strip/ Las Vegas, this is a great place for that to have an excellent meal!!",

Never checked back after we got our food and then had to wait another 10mins or so for the bill. Came in for lunch at 11:15 didn't get out until after 12:30.

So I was a little nervous, however Janie made sure the amount of food was just enough and a little more for seconds. Catering price is terrific!
