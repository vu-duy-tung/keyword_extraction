    "text": "We been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally got the opportunity to on Friday night after the show. The wait wasn't horrible. Thanks to the player card. However, the wait for the waiter to take our drink order was about 15 minutes. He did recommended us to order an appetizer because the wait for the entrees will be a while. So we did order a sweet corn dip. The dip was good but the popcorn topping was so stale. Did mention it to the waiter. And all he say was I'm sorry you didn't like it and took it away. Our entrees did arrived about 20 minutes later. I got the hell kitchen burger and my husband got an ultimate burger and truffle fries. The fries was big enough to share. Unfortunately, it was cold. You can see that the fries was made ahead of time and just sitting under the heat lamp for way too long. Would not recommend ordering the fries unless you really want cold hard fries and paying between $8-$12 for it. The burger was really good. So if you are looking for a good thick patty burger. I would recommend you trying this place. But remember to have at least 2 hours or so to spare. You can't just walk in and out in 30 minutes.",

    "text": "The burgers and shakes here are always dope. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The meat was cooked how I requested it (med-rare). The fries sauces were great. Some of my fries came out a little soggy but it's alright since it was only a couple of them, nothing I would cry about. I also ordered the Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake. I always order one to-go so I can sip on it while wandering the Strip since the drink is pretty chilled and the weather is hot. Every time I go to Vegas, I always make it a point to eat here, I never miss out on the great burger.  I am not a professional food critic or chef but I do enjoy good burgers. This is always on the top of my list as #1 burger. I highly recommend you also reserve a table in advance since it's always crowded in here. If you are coming solo, lunch time you can probably find a bar spot without reserving (up to around 2pm) but afternoon, evening, and night times require a reservation to get in quickly.",

    "text": "As someone who's tried Shake Shack, In N Out, other family/private owned burger joints and restaurants, hands down I can say Ramsay burger is definitely worth trying more so than Shake Shack.  My breakdown for the 5 star and the suggestion to get it over Shake Shack is as follows:  Service (4.5) Its a dine in with server style so of course you dont have to self serve like you would at Shake Shack. The server I had was pretty friendly and attentive during the whole time.   Drinks (4.5) While Shake Shack does serve beer, Ramsay Burger has a lot more options and varieties including cock tails and wines. I tried their Irish Mule which was apparently the most popular drink on the cock tails selection. It was as how the server described it, not too sweet but not too overwhelmingly strong. I believe she told me it was composed of jameson, some beer, probably syrup and lime.   Burger (4.5) I tried the Hell's Kitchen which seemed to be composed of provolone, patty, avocado, jalapeno and tomato. Yes the burger was on the pricey side of $15 without fries but shake Shacks burgers all average around $9-11 as well. For the quality of the beef patty and the structure of the burger, I d say this was worth it.   Fries (4.5) Ordered the parmesan truffle fries which came with two sauce. One reminded me of honey mustard flavor and the other close to marinara sauce like taste. But it was surprisingly very good as the parmesan grits and the fries texture blended very well together. It was around $9-10 which once again like the burger, is on the pricey side but its big enough to share between two people. So its not a bad deal at the end of it.   Overall, my friend and I were both pleased with Ramsays burger and did not regret not going to Shake Shack.",

It's definitely worth the line. If you get the chance to visit Vegas (or live here), treat yourself to a burger here. It's truly one of the best ever!",

Homemade ketchup was a nice touch. Onion rings were excellent. We left still feeling a little hungry as the burger size was on the smaller side. Service was outstanding!!!  Two burgers, onion rings and an ice tea came to $60 including tip. If you do want the best burger The Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay is the best anywhere and at half the price.",

    "text": "YES YES YES!!!!!  We had one of the best restaurant experiences that we have ever had in Vegas! We loved it so much, we ate here for majority of our vacation.   Just about everything you need to know:  Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino Resort. He has several restaurants in multiple hotels so don't get confused! When you arrive to Burger, you have to wait in a line to get in. We got lucky with the times that we went and didn't have to wait in line very long but it does get packed so be prepared to wait! The hostesses were so nice and friendly and made us feel so welcome. It was really cool that one of the hostesses remembered us and welcomed us back.   The restaurant is a nice size and the atmosphere is really cool. They do not tolerate drunk and obnoxious guests which was really refreshing!  Service: On both occasions that we went, we had TERRIFIC service! Both of our servers were very knowledgeable of the menu and checked up on us multiple times during our dinner. One employee who really stood out to us was the busser Caleb. Caleb was absolutely a joy to see on both of our trips to Burger. He was one of the kindest employees at a restaurant that we have ever encountered. He deserves a promotion, raise, or something. Just watching him take pride in his job and smile at every table was so refreshing.   Food: YUM!!! Over the course of 2 visits, I had the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\", the \"Backyard Burger\", \"Beer Battered Onion Rings\", \"Kettle Chip Nachos\", and \"Truffle Parmesan Fries\". Everything was PHENOMENAL, except the Fries. They were not as great as I think they could have been but everything else made up for it. Make sure you request your burger to be cooked the way you like it. They normally make it \"Medium\" which is a bit too pink for me.   Prices: I think the prices are spot on. The price is definitely worth the food.  Overall, This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I highly recommend it and we will definitely be making it a tradition to come here at least once when we come to Vegas.  I hope this review helps you decide on where to get a delicious \"Burger\" when you come to Vegas!!!! :)",

Burger patty was delicious but the bread was so forgettable. The patty itself had that smoky over flames on the grill flavor and was quite moist. Fries were subpar; I've definitely had better.  Onion rings were a dream. They are thick, juicy, flavorful, and addicting. Covered in parmesan cheese, I couldn't get enough. The ranch was amazing too as it is made with little bits of cheese that compliment the onion rings perfectly.  Service was good. Our waiter actually suggested that instead of us each getting our own fries, we share as there quite large. He was right. Thanks for the tip!",

The wait can be on the longer end sometimes, but it always worth it because they cook a mean burger.  On my most recent trip, I had the Crown Burger and it was amazing.  I also really love their fries.  The sweet potato come with a delicious honey jalapeno mayo and the regular fries are thick-cut (the best!) and served with curry ketchup (my favorite!).  My one criticism is that their draft beer list is pretty weak.  Otherwise, this place is great.",

I walked in thinking I would need to pay $50 for a burger, but it was surprisingly affordable at $16 for my Blue Cheeseburger. I really like the sweet taste to it (not overwhelming, but a tint) and remember you will need to order fries with it if you want. I think the burger itself was enough for me.  After trying the burger, I cannot tell if it's a special GR burger or just a regular homemade burger. Nothing too special but with a GR stamp.   Also, you get to take the menus for souvenirs in case you want it (which I left).",

I would think (based on other establishments) you could produce a burger and fries for your guests in 10-15 minuets. 30 minutes if you made everything to order.   Perhaps Gordon likes to make his customers wait and wait and wait.  I know he has a lot of patience.   I will not be coming back.",

Yes, I understand that he is a world-renowned chef and that he has put time into creating these fancy, unique burger recipes. However, I personally thought my burger was good, but nothing spectacular.  Seating took a while (as expected), which is okay. However, it took us almost 30-40 minutes to receive the food after ordering. I ordered the Hog Burger - mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion & slaw. The ingredients were fancy and the burger was flavorful. However, the pork was a little too dry for my taste and wasn't really juicy at all. I'd want to order something else next time before deciding if I like/dislike this place.  On the other hand, the Burnt Ends Poutine was good - fries, burnt ends, black pepper gravy, cheddar cheese curds & pickled onions. Incredibly savory and the black pepper gravy was perfect. I enjoyed this much more than my burger..",

There are 2 other Gordon Ramsay places in Vegas as well, but they were hard to get in last minute without a reservation. We really wanted to go to the Hell Kitchen one, but we had to settle for the Burger joint. The wait time was huge. ~1.5 to 2 hours. There was a Casino nearby and so we did some gambling after we checked in. You get a message 5 minutes before your table is ready and if you don't report to the front desk within 10 minutes your checkin is None and you have to start all over again. The food was really great and no short of expectation. Everything was clean and the waiter was friendly. We got the wings to share and the wings were totally finger-licking good. I ordered the Ramsay-special burger and it was amazing as well. Overall, the experience was great and the hype wasn't underrated.",

    "text": "This being a Gordon Ramsay place, I held the food to a higher standard than I would ordinarily. I know of the guy, and I know he demands quality and precision. Would he have been in the kitchen that evening, I wouldn't have heard a barrage of profanity, but I would not exclude a bit of yelling.   First, the server I had, Alex I think was his name was awesome. He definitely knew his stuff, and not from a handbook or manual, no, this dude has tried literally everything. The fact that the food took a little longer than I would expect to come out he let me know ahead of time, which was much more appreciated than the \"It'll be right out\" when guests start to get antsy.   I had ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, cooked medium. Let's start with the good, so it doesn't seem like bashing this place is all I came to do: the flavor from the combination of ingredients was good! The burger wasn't overloaded to the point where you couldn't bite, but everything still came together nicely... or was supposed to.  Now, the not-so-good. If this were some little pub, I would give them more slack. In this case, I expected the same level of precision and quality Mr. Ramsay seems to demand of his chefs.   The meat in the burger was overcooked for what I ordered. Per the server, medium is supposed to have lots of pink. In my case, they had overcooked it, as I got a medium-well, with tiny hidden areas of pink in places. I also found the meat slightly underseasoned, a pinch more salt and pepper would have done this place quite a bit of good.   Then there was the overall execution which I found quite lacking. To me, when I bite into a burger, I'd like to get the same experience with the first bite, last bite, and each one in between. The avocado was more or less evenly dispersed, yet the roasted tomato(es) were very unevenly dispersed. Only a handful of bites got this taste, hence the quotes. As for the jalapeno aioli, it suffers the same problem... it was as if it was slapped on without regard. There was so little of this stuff, I don't even recall tasting it.  I'm hoping the photo I've attached from my meal will at least somewhat corroborate this point.   One of the final points I'd like to make is regarding the fries. If you are here with someone, the portions are great for splitting with a friend or two. However, if you come here alone as I did, the portion of fries it too big for one person. That said, it would be awesome if they had smaller, individual sized portions for those not wanting to eat for two.",

    "text": "What happened????????????  I've been to Burgr (now spelled Burger) twice before my most recent visit and I loved it! Now, Burger is nothing more than a glorified Applebee's!!!  Let me go through my reasoning here....  Arrived with my best friend at 10:30pm (well before closing time). We were seated at a table facing the kitchen. We waited 3 minutes before our waitress came over to let us know she was sorry for the wait and would get us waters. We both were a bit baffled by the wait as we both love GR's restaurants and never had to wait more than 30-60 seconds before someone came over to give us water.  Next, we noticed several tables were not bussed and had dirty dishes and food scraps all over them. This is definitely not GR standards.   As we waited for our food, I watched two cooks drink from personal cups and set the cups right out in view of the customers. Furthermore, both chefs started EATING behind the line WHILE making food!!! In plain view of customers!!   The servers were just as unprofessional. They were laughing and joking with one another, leaning against each other, playing with stuff, goofing off. What we thought was the manager was also being pretty unprofessional for a manager.   We ordered onion rings as a starter and they were very good so we were happy with that. Next, we ordered burgers--the Bleu Cheeseburger. My friend ordered hers medium and I ordered mine Medium-Rare. I took two bites of my burger and stopped. The bun was soaked red from the meat and looked like it hadn't been cooked enough! I put my plate with un-eaten burger to the side and started back in on the onion rings. While conversing with my friend, a busser came and took my burger plate AND the onion rings I was still eating away! No question about how the food was or if there was something wrong with it!  By this point we both had enough and wanted to go. We waited and waited for our waitress to come back with the bill. We waited so long I ended up holding my credit card in the air to signal we were done and wanted the check.   To pour salt in an already open and angry wound, she returned with our check with the total amount UNDERLINED and then again UNDERLINED the words 'gratuity not added to check'. Are you kidding me?? Absolutely poor taste, so tacky! Not up to GR standards at all!!!!!! GR should do Kitchen Nightmares on his own restaurant!!!",

The little cups of ranch salad dressing and so-called house ketchup for dipping are nothing special. Caesar salad was just ok, not enough crunch. Not much flavor from the black garlic dressing. Iced tea to drink. The bill came to $50. You have to decide for yourself if it's worth it. I'm not sure.",

We had looked at the menu prior to sitting down so we can order as soon as we sat down. So as soon as the server took our order we were informed that it was going to be awhile about 20 minutes longer than usual before the burgers would come out as they are backed up in the kitchen. However, he said can bring our fries as our appetizers. We agreed, we got our fries maybe 20 minutes later.   I understood that there was going to be a wait time, the restaurant was full.   However, I was disappointed in my food. I ordered my hamburger medium, there was no pink at all. It was more like a medium well. My hamburger was bland there was no flavor. I was truly disappointed in my food. I would not recommend this place.",

After a 1 HOUR wait we ordered the Mediterranean burger, Blue cheeseburger, and the Farmhouse. They FORGOT to put the figgy jam in mine...which is one of the key ingredients that caught my interest. The server gave me a side of jam and I had to spread on the jam MYSELF....They failed to cook my mothers lamb patty properly...(my mother wanted fully done) which had to be remade and took another 15/20mins for my poor mother!!!! Last but not least the customer service was LACKLUSTRE. I get better service at MCDONALDS!! The server just said I was probably wrong and that the cooks did in fact put the jam but it was hard to see. I fully dissected my burger to show that the buns were in fact plain. The manager...wasn't helpful at all. None of the staff apologized for the inconvenience their staff/cooks have caused.   Common, if Gordon Ramsay, a TOP CHEF WITH MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANTS is going to slap his name on this restaurant...I EXPECT GREATER SERVICE. This will be the FIRST AND LAST TIME I step foot in this restaurant.",

Thanks to the manager that he didn't believed his lies and we had to change the table to another waitress much nicer But honestly all this wait and mistreatment and attitude problem it is created by the place itself since half of the tables are empty while more than 50 people are waiting outside starving !!!!!

Only drawbacks honestly were there's a long wait in the smoke filled casino waiting area then the food takes a long time to get your table. The truffle fries were some of the best I ever had. To booth they're served with a truffle aioli & an extremely flavorful ketchup that was more akin to cocktail sauce. The lobster & shrimp burger was good & although most of the ingredients were fresh I felt like there was a \"filler\" component to the seafood of the burger. The Turducken burger was also far from your typical burger & there was a sweet element to it. My wife had a Prosecco & I had a cocktail that was an extremely fruity rendition of a Manhattan. The drink was delicious but the alcohol content was slim to none. The Oreo creme brulee shake was also good even though I got it to go.",

Then once I gave my order, it took another 7 mins for the server to even get me water. No one even said hi to me and I was looking around and not on my phone. Didn't expect this kind of service from this place. I do agree that this place gets crowded crazy, but still I got a feeling like no one cares that you eat here and they don't mind at all.   Got a feeling that you are not welcomed here. This is because I was sitting at a bar table and saw lot of the employees and none didn't give an eye contact or say even hi.  This is the main reason why I am giving this ratings. The food is really good but service is bad.  I have been to other Gordon's restaurants and they had phenomenal service and also the food was great.",

All the burgers are cooked to order and they can only cook about 30 burgers at a time so it takes about 30 min for each burger. We waited 30 min to be seated then another 30 for the burger. We were in no rush.   Our server Brandon was EXCELLENT!!! He knew the menu and its items inside and out. He's the type of server Gordon Ramsay would approve of. The beer recommendations Brandon suggested were perfect, and just to be sure, he brought the sample of the original beer  we were considering and his recommendation was definitely better.   The food was delicious! The onion rings are to die for. Honestly, skip the fries and go for the onion rings instead. The beer batter, cheddar ranch, and chipotle ketchup are made in house and you can taste it. The truffle fries and regular fries were not for me, but they were good.   I got the farmhouse burger with a fried egg and bacon. It was delicious. Despite the fact that I was nursing a huge hangover, it hit the spot. My caramel pecan milk shake was so creamy and delicious but not overly sweet.",

If you have a Total Rewards card then you'll get a discount. I believe if you're a diamond or platinum, then you'll get first priority when waiting in line.  They have a variety of beer, cocktails, shakes, and non-alcoholic beverages. I ordered the Oreo Creme Brulee... broke da mout! (translation: out of this world!) This was the first time I bought a shake and I was in LOVE. We had the chicken wings - not too spicy with bleu cheese chunks sprinkled. The sweet potato fries are delicious - extra sugar is provided on the side!!  The menu is a souvenir and you can take it home! I showed anyone interested which foods or drinks to order.  The servers, hostess, and food runners were helpful and prompt. Their uniforms look very comfortable. Jeans can be worn and the tops look dri-fit type material.  Love this place. It's not fancy. Very casual and relaxing environment. Kids are welcomed too!",

I realize it's a busy restaurant but I'm not sure how it could take 40 minutes to make our burgers. It was also discouraging when our neighboring table sat down after us and they got their food before us and left before we got our burger...  Maybe because we ordered some beer is why they took so long but we wanted cold beer with a good burger. By the time our burger came out beer has warmed a bit... I'm not sure if our order just got lost or entered wrong but for a high class restaurant it sure sucked.   Onto the food: (once it arrived) the truffle fries are out of the world! They come with their house ketchup and maybe truffle mayo? It wasn't too crisp but it wasn't soggy either! We ordered one order and it was plenty for the three of us mainly because the burger was big! I recommend the first burger I think it was hell burger? It's the one with roasted jalapenos. Hands down that has to be one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly medium and the roasted jalapenos with the avocado was such a good texture! Add fries and ketchup and it was an excellent meal.  However I value service as well and while I would like to come back.. I doubt it.",

Recommendations made.   Ordered apps that were WOW. Recommend all of the selections we made. Hummus, Kettle Chip Nachos, and Fries. You will not be sorry.   The burgers were probably the best burgers we've ever had. Between Turkey Burgers, Backyard Cheeseburgers, even the spicy burger (name escapes me) they were perfection. The Hot Dog was the biggest hot dog ever and was scrumptious!  We also ordered fries, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries. O M G!!!  We had no room for dessert which was sad but we will definitely be back!!  Plan on special occasions though because the bill can get hefty.   Enjoy!!",

    "text": "My gf and I had about an hour before our show was going to start so we wanted to grab something to eat. We walked over to Planet Hollywood and we saw there was no line here at 6pm. My gf was craving a burger and had always wanted to eat here, soooooo off we went. There was a wait of 5 minutes to which we avoided by sitting at the chef's table. Normally we love to sit at the chef's table, but this table was different. We sat right next to where the servers roll the silverware. So the staff would dump the silverware into the bucket and it was like nails on a chalkboard over and over again. We did our best to ignore it, but it was tough for sure. We looked back outside and there was now a line of 20 people!   The benefit of sitting at the chef's table is you get to see all the food as it comes out. In addition there is plenty of staff there to help if you need more drinks, items or just have questions. When our server greeted us, he immediately let us know there was a 30-40 minute wait for food. We decided to chance it and order food possibly missing a few minutes of the show. Plus at most places they over estimate those times to cover themselves, usually it's half that time.   We decided to go w/ their specialty burger of the day, to which they only make a certain amount of. I'm not sharing what that is due to not knowing if they only serve it particular days of the week, certain months or if it's a one time thing. I wouldn't want to get your hopes up. In addition to that burger we ordered the 'Hells Kitchen' burger - asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno aioli  We kept watching food come out and hoping it was ours. It was starting to close in on that 30-40 minute mark. We hadn't see our server since dropping off our drinks and taking our order. Like magic he appeared when the food arrived. To which I quickly asked for the check. The manger on duty came to us to apologize for the wait and ask if we needed anything else. I informed her of the lack of attention our server gave as we sat there and how our waters weren't refilled during the time we got them until the time we got our burgers.  Once we started digging into these burgers, we realized it was worth the wait. Typically it can be hard to wow me w/ a burger at a particular price, but maaaaaaaaaaan were these burgers good! The specialty was $25 and the Hells Kitchen burger was $16. Both well worth the wait and price.   If you are craving a burger on the strip, def check this place out! Just make sure you get a table and not the chef's table.",

    "text": "We visited Vegas and had lunch at Gordon Ramsay Burger on January 2nd.  The line to get in was not too bad when we got there.  However, since we have 6 people, we would have to wait for another hour or so to get a table.  So we decided to split the table for 4 and 2 people separately.  I ordered the Hell Kitchen burger, my husband ordered the Portebello burger (vegetarian), and my brother-in-law ordered the Farmhouse burger.  We also got a side-order of fries as well.  Services were good and the server was attentive.  Wished that we could be seated next to each other but I understood that the restaurant is very busy.  For the food: - Hell Kitchen burger:  was delicious for my taste bud.  It got a kick from the jalapeno and the sauce.  The burger was juicy and the buns were perfectly toasted.  If you like a bit of spice for your food, this is the one to order. -  Farmhouse burger:  I did not like it as much.  The patty was dry, the bacon did not have a crunch, and the whole thing tasted salty.  I would not order it personally.  However, my brother-in-law enjoyed it. -  Portebello burger:  it had 2 patties of the portebello, which was a plus, as many other portebello burger I tasted in the past only had one patty.  It was more citrus for my taste but when you took a bite of everything (quite difficult to do because it was big and messy lol), the flavor balanced out perfectly.  My husband enjoyed the burger. -  the fries :  the Parmesan and the herb in it were great.  But I wish the fries to be more crispy.  I enjoyed the extra dipping sauce.  I forgot what the sauce is called.  Overall, it's a good place to try as the food and service did not disappoint me.  However, I still prefer In & Out burger over these anytime lol.",

The texture on the burgers does not seem cheap like a standard burger joint, the fries and poutine is wonderfully seasoned.

    "text": "Came here to celebrate a monthiversary with the bf & had such a good time!  THE WAIT: - there was a 20 foot line of people around 1PM on a Saturday but we only ended up waiting around 20 minutes!  THE FOOD: - Sweet potato fries +4/5 They sprinkle powdered sugar over the fries, giving the plate a unique, yummy taste. Feel free to ask for extra condiments (chipotle aioli, ketchup, etc..) on the side too!  - Hell's Kitchen Burger +4/5 This was my first time trying this burger & wow - it was good. I'm not a burger person so this says a lot too. The jalapeno added the perfect spicy kick to it & trust me - add an egg to your burger to reward your tastebuds. The only downside was that the burger was pretty salty.  - Hogg Burger +4.5/5 The bf ordered this and we both didn't expect how big the burger was going to be. He couldn't finish all of it but devoured as much as he could. If you've already had the Hell's Kitchen burger, definitely try this one next!  SERVICE: - was amazing. Despite the restaurant was super busy, Daniel - our server - made sure that we got our drinks/food/check in a timely matter. Thanks, Daniel!  If you're visiting Vegas, definitely make an effort to come visit this spot - you won't be disappointed. :)",

    "text": "It pretty much lived up to the hype! Huge line for lunch but we were able to give our name & phone number so we could wander around or gamble. We did split up to do that & the wait was shorter than the 40 min. It was about a half hour but felt a lot faster.   Walking by, there were a bunch of empty tables. And we were seated at one of them later. I never understand why places do that, is there not enough staff or does it take that long to seat people?   Anyways on to the food:  Chicken wings (5+)- Prob the best damn chicken wings I've had in my life. The sauce was perfect. It was not a normal chicken wing but like a lollipop style where it's cut differently and the meat literally just falls off the bone. The blue cheese sauce is a must with it, my cousin wanted to opt out since he's not a blue cheese fan but he's so glad we got it on the side so he could try it & he was a fan.   Blue Cheese Burger (4 stars)- This was my favorite out of the 3 that we had. I love blue cheese & ah fig jam brings the sweet & salty aspect of it. I've had better burgers so it's not quite 5 stars but def satisfied the craving.   Hells Kitchen Burger (4 stars)- my second fav and others first. So I guess it's also all personal preference. This was a tasty burger though.   Forest Burger (3.5 stars)- I found this one to be a bit dry. Thank goodness for the duck bacon which made the burger have flavor but as a whole nothing to write home about.   Truffle Parmesan Fries (5+)- god damn these were good. You know how you order these and all the Parmesan eventually just falls to the bottom? Well this place knows how to do it right. Perfect seasoning on each fry & homemade dipping sauces (truffle aioli & homemade ketchup) were excellent!! A must order!   Overall if I were craving burgers in Vegas I may come back or try another place. It was surprising to me that the things I enjoyed most weren't the burgers though. So maybe I need to try different appetizers, sides & dessert next time!",

I got the blue cheese burger medium and it was absolutely the best burger I have ever eaten. It has this amazing figgy jam on it. We got the street corn dip as an app. My boyfriend is a very picky eater and even he scarfed it down. The only thing I didn't like is the fancy ketchups that came with the French fries. One was curry which I don't like in any dish and the other was a chipotle which was too spicy for my liking. The waitress bought me a cheddar ranch that they make in house and it was bomb. Only cost about $60 (with only coffee and soda) which is a steal on the strip!",

    "text": "Gordooooon! Where you at Sir Ramsay who hailed from the great lands of Scotland! According to Wikipedia, sir Ramsay was born in Scotland. I learned something new writing this review.   I wasn't a huge fan of this place which i don't think is a reflection of Gordon Ramsay's capacity to construct a wonderful meal. It must have been an off night for the head chef who ran the kitchen or something of that nature.   We got to the Burger at 10pm but was greeted with a 40 minute waits that only served to increase my anticipation as it was clearly popping. The ambiance is reminiscent of a standard diner. I was kind of expecting  it to be of finer dining. I particularly liked the silverware and the weight I had to them.  We ordered the poutine fries, hog burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger.  The poutine fries were probably our favorite of the night. The pickled vegetables were the highlight as it served to brighten and elevate the dish to another level with its acidity. It counteracted the fries and the heavy gravy perfectly.  The Hell's Kitchen burger was ordered medium rare but came closer to a medium well. The flavor profiles seemed okay but it was just incredibly dry. I didn't discover this till later on because my wife was such a good sport about it.  The hog burger was, in my humble opinion, preferable to the Hell's Kitchen burger. It had a mild sweetness that permeated my palate elegantly. It balanced well with the saltiness of the bacon. It was still a bit dry though.   Overall, the food wasn't bad. It just was a far cry's worth away from the money that had to be spent for it.  The water and ice used was really good. It seemed like good quality ice!",

    "text": "Yes! This place is delicious! We checked out this restaurant on our first day in Vegas, as we were looking for a good hamburger place. We ended up going in between lunch and dinner, so thankfully we did not have to stand in line too long. We did walk by other times, and the line was pretty long. We have learned that in Vegas, that's a good sign! If people are waiting in line outside your restaurant, it must be pretty good.    To be honest, the restaurant sold us in name only. We knew that Gordon Ramsay was featured on his own television show, so we knew we had to go check it out. We ended up splitting two hamburgers among the three of us, as well as just one side of fries... It was plenty. We thought this would be an in between meal and that we would have room for dinner a couple hours later, but we actually ended up being stuffed.  Know that the choice of burgers do you not come with fries, those are extra. They are definitely a good addition to any burger, so I would definitely recommend getting some even if that means splitting them. The people next to us got a salad, and it was humongous! I think she could've definitely split that with her family.  Great restaurant, delicious burgers! The entrance to this restaurant is right on the strip, so it's easily accessible from the street and walking distance from our hotel at Caesars Palace. Check it out!",

Omg the burgers were delicious I recommend you order the Hell's Kitchen burger you won't be disappointed. We got regular fries and sweet potato fries and they were so yummy with their special sauce.

The only bad things about it are the wait times and the display with all the flames is kinda hot to stand next to after walking in the sun and heat to get there. Both times we had to wait over 30-60 min for a table but you do get a beeper you can take and go gamble for a while. The restaurant always seems to be packed.   As for the food--I've gotten the Foie gras duck bacon burger both times and I have zero regrets. Everything on it complements each other wonderfully. We prefer to share a thing of fries because it comes with so much food. There's a dip of truffle aioli that would probably be even better if you just put it on your sandwich.   The chairs are super wide and cushie, I absolutely love the regular dining chairs and I don't normally comment on those. They're definitely made to accommodate an American bottom.   Come here for lunch, just don't come starving because you will be waiting for a long time. Plan accordingly and bring a snack to wait.",

Funniest quote from the skit \"Hell's Cafeteria\"   Visited Vegas and dropped by one of Gordan Ramsay's restaurants for lunch  Had the HOG BURGER  - Mangalitsa Pork  Mangalitsa Bacon  White Cheddar  Pickles  Crispy Onion  and Slaw.  Amazing explosion of with each bite, so much fatty goodness but it was well worth it, lol  2nd Pic:  AHI TUNA SLIDERS - Ahi Tuna  Sriracha Mayo, Cabbage, Ponzu, Crispy Onion, Jalapeno Aioli.  It's probably a delicious appetizer, but personally for me, squishy fish in between buns didn't meld well together for me  3rd Pic: Fries  for days - Sweet Potato Fries, Truffle Parmesan Fries, Just Fries.  Can't go wrong!  Really liked the ambience here.  Clean, servers were attentive, definitely will be a round two on the next Vegas trip!",

I waiting in line for about thirty minutes. I was almost to the front when the hostess told me since I was by myself I could sit at the bar. My bad, but in my defense, there's a sign that says to check in at the front if you have a party bigger than three, nothing about solo diners. So now you know, if you're alone, go to the hostess desk and get a seat at the bar.  It was freakin' cold at the bar. I wished I had a light jacket with me.   The service at the bar was efficient. The bartender suggested the Gordon Ramsay Burger. $17. I also ordered the beer-battered onion rings, $9, and iced tea, $4.   The bartender said it would take about 25 minutes to cook the burger since it's so thick. I think I got it in less than 20 and it was cooked just right. So were the onion rings. See my pics. As good as it looks!  Darn good burger and onion rings. No doubt about it. It was almost $40 for the burger, rings and soft drink. Pretty pricey, but glad I payed tribute to Ramsay and his burger.",

I've visited a few times, and tried a different burger each time, and have generally been content. My favorite so far is the Curry burger (which is actually chicken, not beef). Had some nice curry spices. Prices are fairly reasonable for the strip.   The sweet potato fries are okay, but they add sugar?!? They are already sweet enough as it is. Price is okay given that one serving is sufficient for 2-3 people.   Fairly good draught beer list.   Line can be long, but moves reasonably fast.",

I recommend looking up the busy times for this restaurant since my group had to wait for 1hr 30min to be seated. If you have a group of more than 3 go to the front desk to give your name and number so they can text you when your table is ready.  The burgers are great as well as the onion rings which were my favorite! Don't let the pictures on yelp decieve you the burgers are not small they are actually bigger than they seem. One order of onion rings/ fries are enough to be shared between 2-3 people. Shout out to our server Adam who was just great as he tended to anything that we needed I can absolutely recommend him!",

The wait was close to an hour when we got there, but if you have a Platinum or Diamond card you get preferential seating - luckily my stepmom does so we only waited about 20 mins.   The GREAT:  Beer Battered Onion Rings, Kettle Chip Nachos, Burnt Ends Poutine, Ultimate Cheeseburger, Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake   The GOOD:  Farmhouse Burger, Backyard Burger, Creme Brulee Shake  The NOT GOOD:  Chips with Curry Sauce, Lobster and Shrimp Burger  By far the best things I tried were the Onion Rings & the Ultimate Cheeseburger. They were flipping fantastic! I could literally smell all the delicious cheese on the burger when they put it down in front of my niece. I should have ordered that! The worst thing I had was the Lobster and Shrimp Burger, which I split with my stepmom. The consistency was just awful and the flavor was not that great. Neither of us finished our halves. Also the Chips with Curry Sauce, we thought would be a curry ketchup, but it was really just straight Indian Curry and the fries had no flavor on their own.   Service was excellent, we were constantly being checked on and all the food came out really fast. With 6 people dining, multiple appetizers, sides, shakes, and cocktails, the meal was about $190. Not bad at all! I will definitely eat here next time I am in Vegas!",

We had a group of 5 and the wait was an hour and a half, but they text you when your table is ready, so we just went to a bar until then.  Finally seated around 11pm! Our group shared kettle chip nachos and truffle Parmesan fries, while for myself, I ordered the crown burger. The nachos were sooo good, super unique and probably way too many calories to think about but oh well. The fries were thick cut and perfectly cooked. Their ketchup is delicious! I liked it a lot more than the truffle aioli. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out just that. The burger itself was a little smaller than I had imagined but it was still very filling. The crown burger has simple toppings, nothing over the top. But it is done well and the flavors pair great.",

Luckily if you are a TR member, you can pass the line and be seated almost immediately. The line wasn't too bad when we got there, but it was still nice to get the preferred seating.  Our server made the experience just a bit underwhelming, but the food definitely made up for it! I'm not sure of the server was new, but she did not know the beer menu very well, or even who the chef was?!?!  The fries and homemade ketchup are great, love the extra spice they put in the ketchup. I had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious. It takes a little extra time for the burgers, but it is well worth it. I ordered mine medium rare and it came out perfectly. The other burger we tried was the Backyard burger; your standard burger. It too was good.",

That said, I would go as far as saying that the $27 lobster and shrimp burger is either the worst or at least top 3 of the worst things I have tasted in my life. I'm not sure if it was not cooked properly or something was done wrong with the preparation but it didn't taste right at all. I took 3 bites total and that was it. I also cut pieces off and passed it to others at my table and they also said it had a weird taste to it. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  Second gripe is the service. Our waitress took our order and came back for the check, that was it. I've had better service at McDonalds, seriously. She didn't even bother to ask if anything was wrong with the burger when she saw that it wasn't even half eaten.   Screw this place.",

    "text": "Tagline \"intense flavor, casual dining\" might be cheesy, but it isn't inaccurate either. I got the $17 farmhouse burger and it was perfectly cooked, every bite was scrumptious, and it paired perfectly with the bartender's recommendation of Rince Conchon Belgian wheat beer on draft. Overpriced but the best option for casual sports bar dining if you don't want to consume utter crap. Did not appreciate the fact that they don't put prices for alcohol on the menu (my $14 beer was barely worth it). Delicious.  Accessibility Wheelchair accessible entrance, mix of high top, bar, standalone, and booth seating. Very loud. Good lighting. No captions on the television screens. They have vegetarian and GF options.  Seating & Atmosphere Upscale sports bar vibe(there are TVs everywhere), terrible acoustics, bar has 8 high top seats and 2 wheelchair accessible spots (very spacious bar seating). But like everywhere else in Vegas, You can't make reservations via OpenTable, and even if you're dining alone, you still have to wait on the long line to be seated (unless there is already an open spot at the bar).  Suggestions for Management Add hooks for coats and bags at the bar, along with USB ports to charge phones",

    "text": "(4.5/5) A little late on the review but better late then never, this is for having a consistent and great experience at Gordon Ramsey burger every year I visit Vegas.  The solid selection of burgers, with one for every palette preference, is the most outstanding. Always cooked to perfection and presented well every time. I applaud the truffle fries for always fulfilling that craving for rich foods and the selection of drinks, from shakes to alcoholic beverages, for always having something I'm in the mood for.   My reason for the 4.5 stars involves the wait time and the even more strict party policy. While it is consistent (something the restaurant has nailed in every aspect), the average wait time for when I've visited the past 3 times has been over an hour and a half. As with our party, we arrived just 2 minutes after our in person-reservation time which warranted an additional wait time of 20 min. That said, I will continue to visit this restaurant when I return and recommend it to others.",

I had to try a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant on our stay.  The Wait was about 30mins but they texted us when our table was ready (really like that).  Very busy restaurant.  Our server was friendly and provided us with some suggestions including an Innis (\"Gordons favorite\")   We started with the Nachos with shredded short rib and English Cheddar Cheese, OMG WOW.  I think I almost started to cry at the first bite.  The Forrest Burger was my choice for the main.  It came out and was Well done when I asked for Medium Rare....  Im not going to lie, I REALLY took pleasure in sending it back, I think I even did the Iconic Ramsy back of hand to palm clap.    When I got my burger at the correct temperature it was AMAZING. I was already full by the time I got halfway into the burger but I kept going at of sheer Ramsey Gluteny.   WOW Great job here",

We both shared the truffle fries which were so delicious that I could've stopped there without trying a burger and still been satisfied.   Finally our burgers arrived. I had the blue cheese burger which was the best burger I've probably ever had before! Gordon Ramsay is known for his fine dining but his burgers are just as good! A Las Vegas must!",

I had so much hype filled in my head that I feared it would not live up to it.  Fortunately, everything about this experience was just fantastic.  Is the food expensive?  Sure it is, but then again, you are in Vegas, eating at a place founded by a celebrity chef.    For appetizers, we had the onion rings and the kettle chip nachos.  The onion rings were fried perfectly, with an airy and crunchy batter. The nachos had this amazing cheese sauce on them, and came with big piles of meat.  Both were better than expected.  For the main course, I ordered the farmhouse burger (bacon, egg, fancy cheese).  As per the chef recommendation, I went with medium rare.  The burger literally melted in my mouth as I ate it.  The combination of egg, burger, bacon, and cheese were sublime.  I can honestly say it was one of if not the best burger I have eaten.  Upon finishing it, I immediately thought about how I would order it again the very next day.  Overall, I can't say enough positive things about how delicious and amazing this place is.  Do yourself a favor and eat here, especially if you love burgers.",

    "text": "First and foremost it is rare that a \"celebrity chef \" owned sport seems to survive let alone thrive in a place like Vegas. There are some exceptions and it seems this Gordon Ramsay location has managed to keep up appearances and keep things rolling.  Lines, lines, everywhere there's lines , do this don't do that can you see those liiii-nnnes! Well yes if you don't time this one right you are facing a decent sized wait for everything including putting your bum down in a seat. They do a hefty lunch time business so better to get there north of 11:45 to avoid the crunch time. The late afternoon into early evening is also fairly well attended.  I have eaten here several times in the past few years or so since they opened. I actually think the food has gotten better and the consistency has also improved with age.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is a special kind of heat but not overpowering.  *Hells' Kitchen Burger isn't cheap at $17 and comes loaded with asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and a jalapeno aioli. The quality of the ingredients shine through to make this one crave worthy.   The burger will leave you full and it is even big enough to share. The hot tip is to get two diff burgers and share with your dining partner. Offers a nice bit of variety.  Of course they offer a bunch of comfort food sides. The dipping sauces( flavored ketchup's) offer a bit of a twist.  Overall our meal was great if not a bit expensive for a couple of burgers and cokes with a shared order of fries.  Service was decent but they did get very busy towards the end of our lunch so refills, plate clearing and the check were a tad slow. All in all a great burger, central strip location and pretty nice peeps doing the serving.",

Our favorites:  the chicken saltimbacco sliders are tasty.  Perfectly breaded, thin, fried chicken topped off with arugula salad that is dressed on a crispy toasted seasame brioche bun.  The onion rings were crispy and not oily, served with house made spicy ketchup and mayo. The mangalica pork burger wrapped in mangalica bacon and pulled pork is divine!  The forest burger is also amazing. All the flavors work well together and the meat temp came out exactly as ordered.  Service:  all the service staff was quick, friendly and attentive.  Our drinks were quickly refilled before empty.  Even though the restaurant was full, service was impeccable and food came up quickly.  I'm totally impressed with how well run this restaurant is and the food is deserving of the Gordon Ramsey brand.  Will be back to try some of the other burgers.",

We were seated promptly and servers were really attentive and nice. Ordered Hog burger with Goat Cheese burger (I don't know what it is called) and onion rings. Onion rings came out first to start, and it was like heaven in my mouth with their specialty sauce on the side. Burgers were great that time. Price is reasonable too, so I would not say anything bad about this place.  But the only downside is that it usually has such a freaking long line that de-appetite you by just looking at that long line, so be aware of that. If you can handle this long line, great place to go.",

First off Id like to say I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay restaurants and in my recent visit to Las Vegas I made an effort to visit every single of his restaurants (Steak, Pub, Hells Kitchen, Fish and Chips, and finally Burger). All the other restaurants were fantastic and I loved the food including this one! So you might wonder why a 2/5.... The service was terrible our server was Hilary and I cannot say one good thing about her, after sitting down we waited about 15 minutes before she made our way to our table after coming to our table she looked like she was not interested in serving us because we looked younger and maybe wont tip as much as the table next to us who she was all over. After asking for a drinks menu it came about 10 minutes after I asked, then took another 20 minutes for our drinks order. Every time she came to our table she was terrible and I saw her going up to other servers laughing and just chatting. She was terrible and if you have her as a server please ask for someone else.",

I had the truffle fries, poutine fries, the Crown Burger, and a creme brulee milkshake as well as a Chamborita cocktail (I shared with others. Lol) The poutine fries we're by far the best poutine I've ever had! They were devoured in almost no time. The burger was wonderful and did the namesake of the restaurant proud! It was a good size, juicy, and the flavors mixed really well with each other. The drink was delicious and strong and the truffle fries were awesome! All in all, I really enjoyed myself! The price is rather off putting, though. The burger alone was $16. That didn't include any sides. The poutine fries were $14, the truffle fries $12 (you can get regular fries for $9), and the drink was $13. The portion sizes are good, though, so you definitely won't leave hungry! Definitely recommend for a nice night out!",

I love Gordon Ramsey and my intent was to eat at all of his restaurants while in Vegas, but I always seemed to be too full from other meals and this was my only stop. We stood in line to get in mid afternoon and, while the line was long (to the end of the window), it went really fast. I read reviews that parties of two stand in line and larger parties go put their names in. I had a really tasty strawberry drink and we ordered the hellfire chicken wings, expecting them to be spicy, but they weren't at all. My bf, a huge wing fan, didn't like them, but I liked them, especially dipped in the sauce they brought on the side. We both liked this sauce and, when they tried to take it away, we asked them to leave it for our burgers - we were glad we did. My bf got the Hells Kitchen burger and I got an off menu burger that I was never told the name of, but it was topped with brisket, arugula, an aioli and picked shallots. My bf said his burger was just ok - underwhelming. I've never gotten tired of a burger halfway through...maybe it was because there was just so much meat on the patty, but I didn't get any other flavors coming through to give it a kick and it was just too much of the same flavor that I was sick of it. I ended up using some avocado and tomato from my bf's burger AND the sauce from the wings and even then it was just ok. I still didn't finish it. I wish I'd had a better experience - maybe I should have tried the lobster and shrimp burger?",

The restaurant looked good but my first impression of the environment was not so good as the bad cigarettes smell of the casino was also in the restaurant. Then there was a slight wait and the hostess were wasting too much time chatting than helping customer. Once we sat down the service was friendly, but a bit too slow.. as it took at least 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered it; on top of that, they got my wife's order wrong. The only reason I gave a 2 star was because the servicer was friendly. Overall, the experience was a disappointment and my wife and I definitely will not be visiting the restaurant again. So sad because I had high expectations from a place that had Gordon Ramsey's name on it and I am a big fan of his shows.",

My honest opinion is that yes, the burgers are good. I could taste the quality of the beef used and it was well seasoned. I had the jalapeno burger which was not really spicy, it just had a small kick. The bun is soft and the ingredients are good quality. I did not really enjoy the sweet potato fries as I found it strange that it had powdered sugar spinkled on it. The negative really has to do with the service. The servers are not that welcoming and act like it's a fast food restaurant as opposed to a sit down. No smiles, no welcoming, no \"enjoy your meal.\" The food runner dropped off the food with a slam of the plate and didn't say a word. Also, this is a rather expensive meal for just a burger. If you are coming here, it's because of the name attached, not necessarily because of the quality of the experience or any value.",

The first burger I tried was the Hell's Kitchen burger. This was absolutely perfect since it had nice spicy flavors to it and huge portions of avocados. The burger was extremely juicy- so much that I spilled it all over myself. The flavors were perfect- not too salty but still good enough to keep you wanting for more. The second burger I had was the Farmhouse Burger. While this one wasn't as the first burger I tried, it was still pretty good. A lot of the flavor came from the egg only. The truffle fries were amazing. There was a lot of truffle flavor to it but the best part came from the dipping sauces! There is a garlic aiola type of sauce and a sweeter ketchup, which might be curry ketchup. Definitely would pay a visit whenever I'm back in Vegas.",

    "text": "WOW . . . I mean. . . WOW  Not many places make me say WOW in a review with all caps, but Gordon Ramsay achieved that twice in Las Vegas! This was one of the two amazing meals thanks to Chef Ramsay!  Came by around 6:00pm on a Tuesday, not too busy and did not wait at all. We sat right by the flaming wall which really gave us a Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen experience!   I will start off with the biggest and quite frankly the only downside to the night...our waiter. All the other waitstaff and hostesses seemed so nice, friendly, easy going . . . but ours was an absolute ass. We sit down and don't even open our menu and asks what we want to eat. Really? The rest of the night he kept coming by trying to force us out. We didn't care, we ate and relaxed, left him no tip.  ANYWAYS now for the absolute best part - THE FOOD!  We ordered a few things, I will list them from least favorite to most favorite!  Pork Belly Hot Pockets - little hot pocket like pastries filled with pork belly, bacon marmalade, and topped with tomato jam and herb aioli. The flavors were honestly great. Tender, juicy pork belly, savory sauces, but it was just so little. For $12, the price to portion ratio just gave a lack of True enjoyment! But still good none the less   Farro-Quinoa & Chicken Salad - this was surprisingly great! A HUGE salad that my mom couldn't finish, even splitting with my dad and I, it was so much food! the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, the vegetables were all cooked to a delicious soft texture, the lemon vinaigrette was light and fresh, and the cheese added a nice creamy sweetness!   Jalapeno Poppers - These were the. best. jalapeno poppers. I. have. ever. had. WOW!  they bring out a long tray of six poppers, each in their own sauce cup. The poppers are HUGE! no cheapness there. The batter is thin, amazingly crispy, deliciously flavored, and inside ...WOW! jalapenos were soft, fresh, and filled with creamy thick bacon cheddar sauce! Then the sauce each popper was dipped in . . . the cheddar ranch sauce . . .OMG . . . thick, savory, salty, rich, cheesy, ranchy, absolutely amazing combination !   Last but not least, the star of the night and the whole vacation - the Truffle Burger!  Let's start with the bun . .the soft, delicious, toasted, poppy-sesame seed bun . . . excellent! Then the thick, amazingly wood grilled patty, so juicy and tasty, perfectly paired with the following condiments . . . truffle tremor cheese, oh so cheesy, warm, creamy, slightly nutty, coating your mouth in cheesy goodness. Topped with foie gras creme fraiche, continually coating your mouth while mixing with the cheese for a  savory, salty, slightly gamey flavor and creamy texture. All of this topped with truffle aioli . . oh man, this was the softest, juiciest burger I have ever eaten! Adding some fresh crunch with the frisee lettuce, this is seriously one of my top three favorite hamburgers I have ever. ever. EVER. eaten.   Chef Gordon Ramsay has brought Vegas an affordable, delicious, amazing dining experience with some of the best food you will ever have the pleasure to enjoy!",

On a brighter note, their new cocktail (cannot remember name but it was pink) was on point! Not too sweet and strong!",

    "text": "Craving a burger in Vegas?  Look no further because this might be one of the best burgers in town.    Came here with a group of friends after driving in from LA. Got to the restaurant at 4pm and was seated immediately. When you first look at the menu you might think the burgers are pricey, but each burger comes with a considerable amount of beef.  I ordered the Forest Burger for myself and our table got the Parmesan truffle fries and sweet potato fries to share.  The Forest Burger comes with mushrooms, tremor cheese, arugula, and duck bacon.  This is my definition of a gourmet burger! The combination of all the ingredients was perfect; no item dominated the other.  If you aren't super hungry, sharing a burger is definitely reasonable, but be sure to ask for a knife to split the burger.  The Parmesan truffle fries are a MUST.  They might have changed up the way they serve this because the first time I ate here (maybe a year ago) it came with shoestring French fries, melted parmesan cheese, and truffles on top. My most recent trip, they came out with thicker pieces of fries, truffles, and shredded Parmesan.  Both times the fries were phenomenal and full of flavor.  Make sure to dip your fries in the garlic aioli sauce that comes on the side, you will thank me later.",

I added an egg which was over cooked, I asked for over medium and for the egg to be runny. That was a #fail but the burger was so good that I didn't even care! LOL Also give the burger a solid 25 minutes to cook, I never knew a burger could/would take that long LOL The truffle fries I didn't care for because they were too thick and heavy for my tasted but we got them because they were also highly recommended. My sister loved them. They were just too thick and rich for my taste buds. His ranch and ketchup were so good! If you like a spicy burger full of flavor this is it! I did eat the WHOLE THING in ONE SITTING LOL",

At the end of the day, it is burger and fries, yet I felt like I paid such a high price for what I was getting. Two burgers, one order of fries and three beers was over $90 after tip, which seems extreme to me. I get that you pay a premium on the strip, but this seemed out of hand. There are other places on the strip that have better burgers and for a lesser price.   Again, if you a Gordon fan, then definitely hit this place up.

We were hungry at 10:30am after we checked out and decided to gamble and have a drink at the Extra Lounge adjacent to the bar.   Before we knew it, we turned around and saw that a line was already forming for the restaurant. We were seated quickly and our server was super friendly. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was just a little spicy and cooked to a perfect medium. My friend got the farmhouse burger which she enjoyed but she ended up requesting a side of avocado to add because she wanted to add a bit of freshness to her burger bc the beef patty, egg, and bacon was just a lot of fat. She was told there was a $3 charge for it but when we got the checks it was $4. We were in a hurry and didn't mention it. The avocado they add to the burgers (whether it comes with it already or on the side is just one big piece of 1/4-1/3 of an avocado which I wish they'd just slice thinly and fan on top of the burger. I ended up doing this myself.  We also split an order of fries which was plenty between the two of us. They are steak fries and not especially crisp on the outside but tasted fine. It came with what I think was curry ketchup and a house made one so if you're just into Heinz, you might have to bring your own.   Overall a great burger, nice staff, and would stop at again if I were staying or doing something closeby.",

I think it comes down to fundamentals with a burger:  the preparation and arrangement of the components, the cooking of the burger, the presentation on the plate....those were all failures for 3 of the 4 dishes.  (One eater liked his Hells Kitchen burger).  Burgers were red-to-pink for medium-well!  And the pickles on one burger were all haphazardly centered in the middle so half the pickles had to be pulled off and the burger rearranged.  Minor quibble but we ARE talking about an $18 burger!  Bacon was soft and chewy on two burgers, and hard as a rock on another.  And the fries!  Just terrible.  Oversalted, and some strange ketchup/tabasco(?) combination, we left the fries alone.  Overall, very disappointed in the Brits' re-imagination of an American classic!",

I got the ultimate cheeseburger and liked it a lot. I liked it even more after I put the spicy ketchup that came with my fries on. The fries were good, seemed like pretty standard steak fries but not totally worth $8 price tag.  All together, burger fries and one drink was $45 with tax and tip. Food was good but price tag may be a turnoff to some",

We're greeted very warmly and the staff is very friendly. Our waiter was Matt. He was super attentive and great service. The steak fries and it was really five star good. We had the Mediterranean burger and the blue cheese burger. Honestly the burgers were not great at all. My bad luck. we both ordered medium rare My burger was way over salted and way overcooked and very burnt taste with hardly any veggies in it. we have very high expectation and high respect for mr. Gordon Ramsay. I mentioned all above to our waiter. No discounts was offered or exchange, but I hope they talk to the chef and get this sorted cause the tables next to us were complaining about the same thing. Will try again next time we are in Vegas. Love the atmosphere and all staff friendliness.",

Now it's time to move on to the Backyard Burger. The burger was delicious, sweet pickles were a great addition to the burger. Lettuce, onions and tomatoes were fresh. So with all that being said. Hats off to this amazing burger.  Ok. What about dessert? I had to try the Cream Brulee Oreo Shake.  It sounded good on the menu and was even better on the taste buds. Great food and service makes this an easy  5 Star Review from me.",

I had prepared medium rare, and it was loaded with dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon and a fried egg. Yummy!!!  Highly recommend the food and beers.  Unfortunately, I had to give Gordon Ramsay Burger only 1 star due to the service. It was not good, specifically one person. The actual service was good once a tall bartender named Michelle helped my girlfriend and me. The other bartender named Petey was solid, too.  Eric was a total jerk. He was very condescending and rude. It seemed as if he was unhappy to be at work and it was an inconvenience to serve my us. He was making rude comments about a prior customer to us. Uhhh, it was tacky.  Topping it off, Eric was extremely disrespectful and sexist to the girl bartender. The constant barrage of talking down towards the girl bartender was such a turn off. My girlfriend and I decided to leave after paying our bill, heading over to Heart Bar for drinks instead.  If Eric had a better attitude towards us and his co-workers, we would have stayed. Hopefully this was just a circumstance on which he was having a bad day. It still doesn't excuse the chauvinistic and disrespectful attitude directed at women our entire meal.  I will definitely be back for the food and beers, but not if Eric is working. Well, I could handle it, but no chance my girlfriend would want to be served by him ever again. Glad there were other bartenders available to help out and the food was delicious.",

The food is good, but it was also expensive ($62 for two burgers including $4 for a tiny bit of avocado, lemonade, and a shared order of fries.   So wait time + expense means I won't go again.

At some point there was meat that came out of the sandwich and just having the meat plain was also delightful, cooked perfectly ! We also had the Crown burger and both of them were so good you can't have them with anything else, i.e fries. You will want to bite in and take your time to allow all the flavours to be enjoyed.

However, our server Jessica took great care of us! Had a great time eating and chatting with my friend during the visit. We ordered the hog burger and the farmhouse burger. Hog burger had great flavor and the farmhouse burger was a great mid-afternoon lunch pick. Truffle fries were tasty, without being too heavy on the flavor as well. Thanks for the food!",

I didn't even put any condiments because the pickles added soo much flavor .",

There was a line and someone told us the the wait was 2 hours or 2 people.   We decided to order take out at the front corner and wander around the Casino while we waited  1 hour...  for a burger (yikes)  They have a lobster burger which was intriguing but we ordered the steak cut Truffle fries ($11 amazing) and 2 burgers: Hell's Kitchen (most popular) with jalapenos  and the Patriot (Turkey burger with shoestring frites and cherry compote)   Total cost was around $48 or $25 each ( we shared fries). Serving size is reasonable. all in all a good burger but Vegas is  overpriced, he's a world renown chef, and I'm sure I won't return - there's too many options",

Decor: They just finished up a rebuild, and it looks stunning. The same fireplace entrance is there to give people wanting selfies more than they could ask for. Comfortable seating and bar area.   Service: It's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, of course it was good. Just be nice and respectful to the servers and they will do the  same to you. I was a little off put when the hostess told me my party could be moved up if I gave her what everyone in Vegas wants...money.    Food: The food has always been spot on. I had a burger with a specialty pork on it. It was super filling, I had to force the fries down too. I can't comment on the drinks, I don't drink alcohol anymore.   Overall: This is a really nice place, great for tourists. It's expensive like all the food there, but worth the wait.",

I really like egg buns and think it may be a better match. The Bacon was the greatest bacon I have ever tasted in my life. I bacon alone could be worth buying. It has a great portion of fat to meat and has a nice crisp to it where it isn't like a chip and has a perfect blend of crisp and flex to it. The house spicy ketchup is some of the best freaking spicy ketchup I've ever had. You can taste the sweetness of the tomato and the slight kick of the spice. I also got the burnt end poutine which is very excessive for one. The fries themselves are very bland, but the Burt ends were amazing. It isn't your traditional burnt ends like how we do it in Texas, but it's still very tender. It has more of a sweetness to it and very much lacks the smokeiness I'm used to, but never the less still have a very interesting twist of flavor",

The first flaw is that if there are two or less people you have to wait in line, if there are 3 or more they will text you when your table is ready which meant people after me got seated well before me. So after over 1 hour plus wait got seated at an empty bar which could have been filled sooner, ordered 2 burgers and fries and had to wait 45-50 minutes for our food and the bacon was burnt to a crisp on one. We watched as a male manager played on his phone and stuck his thumb up his ass and did nothing to make things more efficient or to help. The chefs and cooks were busting their butt, but if this place cannot handle the load they should not be open. I hope Gordon Ramsay reads this and makes some changes",

But every time, we turned back because of the long wait time. This place does not take reservations so there's usually a queue of people waiting to be seated. And on holidays, it can be a while before you can get in. So, we decided to check it out one last time during the trip, and thankfully, there was no queue at the time.   We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries, the vegetarian Portobella Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger (replaced with a Chicken patty). The fries were good. The mushroom in the Portobella was a tad bit overpowering for me towards the end. But nevertheless, it was delicious. My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. He prefers white meat to red. So, they offered to replace the patty with a Chicken patty. The Hell's Kitchen is a spicy burger. It could be a bit too hot for someone who does not eat a lot of spice. But since my husband does, he loved it.  The atmosphere is great and so is the service. We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas.",

Every mouthful has you pausing to take in the texture, aroma and savory bliss of the bun, meat and all your other toppings.  My mouth is watering all over again.  LOVED IT.  Other stuff: the poutine fries were - eh - for me; the star wasn't the fry, it was the pepper....a bit too much, actually.  There were some cheese curds that the menu said were included, but were not visible and didn't add anything.   The drink recommended and mixed by the bartender was good; I might go with a cold beer next time; it would just fit better.    Ambiance is fun, kids can eat there - it's pretty loud, so even if they have spunk and volume like my daughter, it probably wouldn't be too off-putting.  Loved that they sold regular memorabilia (t-shirts, hats) but also had glassware, coasters, bottle openers and cookbooks.  Cool place - can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Craving a good burger and staying nearby, we decided to give Gordon Ramsay Burger a try on a Monday evening. They do not take reservations but we figured we'd get in line and see how fast it moved. After about 5 minutes a girl came by with a tablet, took our name and number, and said we would get a text when our table was ready. She estimated the wait at about 30 minutes, which turned out to be quite accurate.   Our order taker-I hesitate to call him our server because he basically just took our orders-was clearly not interested in chitchat. His first words to us were \"are you ready for me?\" I can probably count on two hands how many words he spoke to us after that. We never saw a drink menu, which is apparently tablet-based because we saw other tables around us looking at it. We all ended up ordering iced teas, which was OK but we might have ordered something alcoholic...so basically they lost some of our business.   Anyway, we all ordered burgers of some sort and sweet potato fries to share. To his credit, our order taker warned us that the burgers would take about 30 minutes, which again proved to be pretty accurate. Our burgers were good but the fries were not especially hot. Portion sizes were decent and prices seemed reasonable, at least for a celebrity chef/gourmet burger joint on the Strip. We don't regret going but it probably won't be high on our list of places to visit next time.",

After a week of amazing food it was time for a burger joint....Cheddar Ale soup was no word of a lie, melted cheese whiz in a bowl haha. The burger was okay but nothing to write home about. Over hyped and under produced. Don't waste your time and money.",

The beer menu had extensive offerings, I was so happy they had a couple selections of Stone Brewing available and would actually enjoy coming here just to have drinks.  We started with the onion rings and truffle parmesan fries, both of which transitioned into excellent sides for the burgers.  The burgers themselves were absolutely awesome, we tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which I did not perceive as being spicy in the least, only very, very delicious!  Also had the Blue Cheeseburger, which I was skeptical about because while I like blue cheese I am not a fan of figs nor jam and I assumed \"figgy jam\" would be something unpleasant to me, but I was surprised how the flavors all worked so perfectly together to make a burger I felt embarrassed about doubting!  I highly, highly recommend not being scared away by lines at this place, I could have been enjoying these burgers so much sooner if I hadn't.",

But it took over 60 minutes for them to deliver a medium well burger.  First it was well done, then it was medium well.  They said they would take care of the cost because of the issue in the kitchen.  But starving at the table for an hour is just unacceptable.  Just disappointed in an otherwise great establishment.  I did like the fact I saw a portobello mushroom burger on the menu.  Might try that, if I ever come back.  For now.. I ill try something else",

I didn't take a photo there are plenty on here anyways.  There it was the ultimate creation in front of me perfectly crafted. I had little doubt how would it taste with sesame seed bun, avocado, jalapenos, roasted tomatos and cheese. After i took that first bite, it was like harmony of different flavors working as one not fighting but working together. I was really happy and enjoying every single bite of this masterpiece  burger. I don't know what else to say try it for yourself, I am definitely coming back for more....",

Ive been wanting to try his steakhouse for the longest tine, but we wanted to try out the affordable option first....ramsay burger. Because of my infatuation, i had HIGH expectations.  We waited in a 20 minute line. And i was getting nice and toasty by the front glass where the fire display was.  While youre in line, theres a touch screen menu you can scroll at. Pretty economical. There are tvs around, if you wanted to catch a game.   We sat infront of the cooking line. It was amazing to see how efficient everyone was working and how fast food was getting expedited without losing quality.  We both werent super hungry, after eating all day. So we split a burger and app  We ordered the pork special. Pork burger wrapped in bacon for 18$ as recommended by our waiter, his favorite burger. I trusted him....and wish i went with my own intuition. It was good, dont get me wrong. But i felt i would have liked another burger much more.  Mushroom poutine: ive never had poutine and ive always seem ramsay go around the world poutine-ing this and that. So i was excited to try it out. I actually like it better than the burger. Definitely my favorite and most memorable. I went there sunday, and im sorry to say i cant remember the pork. And i love pork. Every single component in the poutine had its own tune. After awhile i started to disect it and try everything on its own(im such a brat foodie like that) and i wasnt disappointed. I could taste all of the ingredients put in. So much love into that poutine! And im sure it was prepped and reheated. Lol  I will definitely return and choose my own burger to my liking. And go for the poutine again. I wish i ordered another one to take home!  I cant wait to try the steakhouse next!",

We went on Saturday night and it was a 1.5 hour wait so we left, and instead came on Sunday morning at 11am and it was only a 20 minute wait!

Our waiter made sure to check on us occasionally to refill our water and crack a few jokes.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries ($12) are pretty good. My favorite part is the dipping sauce - I'm pretty sure they make it from scratch (Fresh tomatoes and truffle oil, etc)  Hellfire Chicken Wings ($14) are amazing. Huge pieces, juicy, and an explosion of flavor! I definitely would choose this over their fries.  The Crown Burger ($15) is probably my personal favorite. It's extremely flavorful and the meat is spectacularly cooked - make sure you order no more than medium (I suggest getting medium-rare though).  The Hell's Kitchen Burger ($16) is alright. If you like spicy, this may be a good choice - but I personally don't think it tops the Crown burger in terms of flavor. Again, make sure you don't over medium for the meat!  The Lobster and Shrimp Burger ($26) is delicious. It's something worth trying once if you're a seafood lover. The proteins are cooked nicely. The only thing that makes this a turn-down is well.. The price.",

    "text": "True to Vegas style, Gordon Ramsay Burger has an over the top commercial vibe but a pleasant enough atmosphere. Service was pretty good. We started with the kettle chip nachos which had a decadent delicious creamy cheese sauce and tender short rib beef topping, pretty yummy. We also had the truffle Parmesan fries that were thick, crispy, while being soft on the inside, really satisfying. The burger selection was pretty impressive and definitely had something for everyone. I chose the farmhouse burger which I have to say was pretty delicious with a nice large juicy patty, thick chunks of bacon and an oozy egg. My one complaint is that the burger patty was a little under-seasoned for me. I heard no complaints about anyone else's burgers. All in all I would recommend this place if you're a Gordon Ramsey fan and your craving a solid delicious burger and satisfying pub food.",

Overall not a super vegan friendly place but my server Justin and the expediter on the line really put in the extra effort.  Ordered the Bleu Burger -cheese -mayo on the lettuce wrap (bun has dairy) and drizzled the cider vinegar reduction over it (assured me the binder is xantham gum - Thank you ) and steered me clear of the truffle fries because apparently there is also some dairy in the truffle salt. So there you have it  The taste came out amazing and I especially enjoyed the figgy onion jam! Overall it was a very friendly vegan experience for a burger place.",

We split the Bleu Cheeseburger with truffle fries. The burger also had manchego cheese and arugula lettuce. The Bleu wasn't over-powering and everything blended together nicely. The fries were a must-do as other reviewers have pointed out. The real star was the meat patty which was done absolutely perfect! I'd like to know how they do it.

If your making a weekend visit, I recommend coming to the restaurant early or face a line.  I went during the week and I was immediately seated.  We ordered an Oreo cookie shake to start.  It was incredibly decadent.  The bottom was the normal Oreo shake, but the top is filled with Creme Brulee and whipped cream! As for the burgers, they are delicious.  I tried the Blue Cheeseburger.  It had blue cheese, manchego cheese, figgy jam, arugula, cider vinegar reduction, and a spicy mayo.  The flavors really worked well on this burger.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I liked the sweet with the savory.  I've learned my mistake with the fries.  There's enough for 2 people to share, so only order one.    I really like the family of restaurants Gordon Ramsay has been putting out.  If you can, you should make it to his Fish and Chips north of Burger.",

The big thing with this place is timing.  If you go in off hours it's no problem.  During a regular dinner or lunch hour it's packed and there are lines out the door.    Since it was an off time, I can't say if the service is always this good but on that day it was perfect.  We sat down with our menus, had the server there in minutes to take our drink orders.  They have lots of appetizers and stuff on the menu but since I never eat a lot I opted to just eat the burger and fries.  Think maybe they make their own buns or source them from some bakery because they didn't come out of a package.  The burgers were juicy and just the right amount of toppings.  Fries seemed like they might have been double fried, crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.    If you're a burger lover, don't miss this place, even though I'm not a fan of Gordon Ramsay",

My wife watched as they talked and laughed at us! I respect Gordon's reputation to service and his food but this staff ruined it for us! The manager comped our three orders of fries they forgot to serve with our food, and our server, frustrated, immediately brought out our fries and with no remorse said the chef apologizes! Not the server! Then we were ignored and arrogantly ignored! As a higher level government employee and 20 year navy veteran I have never been disrespected so horribly! The manager is a joke and a failure to Gordon's impeccable reputation! I will shit on this mans grave for the horrible way he handled the whole issue! A simple table side apology and maybe a desert for the kids would have sufficed! Get your act together and represent Hell's Kitchen as your chef so deserves! What a disgrace to me, a veteran, my friend, who thought this was a once in a life time experience, my wife who's 46th birthday is ruined, and my kids who had to watch this bullshit! Two stars only because the food was good and Gordon is my wife's favorite chef! The management is shit and the server needs to learn respect to his clientele.",

The onion rings are good and crunchy. They taste like a Funyun potato chip. So the star of the show should be the Burger, right? Uh, no. It took 45 minutes to get our food. Our waiter apologized because it takes usually \"30 minutes\" as he said in the beginning. I think 30 minutes is too long so for me, 45 for a forgettable burger is just ridiculous . Our food comes and I'm excited.   My medium burger had zero pink. The grilled tomatoes looked like it was just thrown on there.  I take a bit and it taste whatever. Not bad, not good. Tasted like a dry well done burger. So I'm hungry and definitely not going to wait for a new one. Well I start eating and I realize the Burger becomes extremely hot tasting. Burn your mouth off, all you taste is chili, hot. I open the burger and the end of the chili they didn't take out all the seeds or forgot. It was so hot I could no longer eat it. Thank God it was only at 1 end, about 1/3 of the burger. My husband even said, \"WOW that is super hot, no way will I eat that.\" So I won't be coming back. Our waiter was nice and the staff was on it. The food was not anything to make a special trip over. Definitely not worth the average time of 30 minutes. Mediocre at best. Don't waste your money.",

You forget how good they can actually be sometimes. - The french fries are good if you like A thick cut french fries. They were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Perfectly cooked. Seasoned well. - The burger I ordered was rather plain as it just had meat cheese and bacon only. I wanted to see what the burger was like without tons of toppings on it.

I think we waited just shy of an hour for a gourmet burger and fries that were both mediocre in relation to price and wait time. The forest burger was nearly devoid of mushrooms (only two little morsels on each half) and the fries were kinda dried out steak fries and came with two sauces. The one sauce was a truffle aioli which was good and the other was a \"ketchup\" that I am pretty sure was house made and not very good. I could taste the worshi sauce and celery salt and other ingredients independently and it wasn't very well balanced. Heard management dealing with other customers regarding wait time and seemed very service oriented. Perhaps the wait time was a bit more than usual. I would recommend giving this place a try maybe during off hours in between lunch and dinner.",

I'd recommend trying something different...or a different place.  The Parmesan fries were really good, the sweet potato fries were not...just give those a miss.  Service was pretty quick once we got a table.",

    "text": "Great first time experience here, came early on a NFL Sunday and got table next to the bar. Server was excellent and told us all about menu and we chatted about Ramsey for a bit. Seems he drops by every couple of months to check up on things. Kinda of nice to know that he's not just selling his name.  I started with the onion ring appetizer which was probably the best I be ever had. The Maui onion lent a sweetness that really popped in my mouth like no other onion I've had. The batter was light and very flavorful and not greasy. My wife and I split the Forest  and Tandoori chicken burger and enjoyed them both, maybe a bit of an edge to the Forest because when I think of burgers I think beef, but can't go wrong with either. The service was a bit slow, but I don't mind when the product is this good. It is a busy restaurant and they want to make sure the experience is good, so just don't go if you're in a rush.  If you want quick service go to McDonald's. The only negative from me is the dining room is a bit bleh, just cafe style. Would have been nice to have been a little more upscale. But overall, I highly recommend and cannot wait to go back and try more items next time I'm in Vegas.",

I ordered a set of wings, the crab shrimp burger, lamb burger, and the firehouse burger; all of them were good but just didn't have a punch. They came with sweet potato fries and normal fries; the sweet potato fries were also just okay because they added some white powder to it and it was way too salty and the normal fries were too dry and soft, as I felt like I'm eat mashed potato sticks that were fried. I also ordered their crum Berle Oreo shake and pecan caramel shake, the Oreo shake was phenomenal. But the burgers are whack, so 2 out of 5 because I went there for a burger, the burgers were trash for the hype this place was. The fries were trash and any beginner can do better, the burger was a hype and some franchise restaurants are much better and cheaper(BJ's brewhouse), but the chicken wings are too die for and the Oreo shake was unreal.",

    "text": "I hate leaving three stars as I am a huge Hell's Kitchen fan. The stars were how long it took to get our food by the time we sat down and hardly any alcohol in our drinks.We sat down at 7:00pm April 26th and received our food at 7:55pm. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The flavors were there but mostly bun needed more meat. My mom order a burger with mushrooms and she loved it. The truffle fries were greasy and not my favorite truffle fries. They were on the thick side and just absorbed all the grease. The flavors were there, I think the fries sat too long before coming to our table. I and my mom ordered two cocktails(cannot remember the exact name) pineapple juice, rum and midori sour. What the cocktails were lacking was a balance between alcohol and juice. We paid $12.00 each for nothing but Juice. I already sent one drink back the Moscow Mule because it tasted like medicine. I  had drinks at Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse and I was hoping the same quality. I have ate at all of the LV Gordon's Ramsay restaurants and this will be my last visit here. I did take the survey at the table and when asked to speak with a manager I opted out. The reason I was so irritated with how long it took to get our food that I just wanted to leave.",

    "text": "For the price, the long lines and all the Hoopla around Ramsey, I'd expect the burgers to be phenomenal. They were decent, but nothing that justifies all the above. I give it 2 stars because about a year ago, I ordered the fish and chips dish (which I believe is no longer on the menu - and thank god for that!) and what I got was appalling. That fish was so greasy, I literally had a POOL of grease on my plate. When picked up there was grease dripping from the fish. I made the mistake of taking a bite and had a real gag reflex. Yes it was THAT BAD. It felt like I got a big tablespoonful of oil in my mouth. I couldn't even swallow it. I had to spit it out into my napkin. For someone who was seen so often yelling at other restaurant owners about greasy fish and chips (on Kitchen Nightmares), the guy should go taste the version his own establishment serves. I think it takes special talent to get the batter that full of grease.  Perhaps it was a fluke, but a dish like that should never leave the kitchen at ANY restaurant. Or maybe that's why the dish is no longer on the menu...?  We were 4 people at our table and nobody really liked their food very much. All other dishes ordered that day got very mediocre responses from our table. Anyway, we never went back after that.",

I could have made them better at home. The server was an a$$h*** and couldn't even deliver regular ketchup. Only chipotle ketchup that tasted terrible. This is American food. Get some regular ketchup. Server said I'm just not used to it. No salt and pepper within reach. The server was rude to his trainee in front of customers. He had a bully attitude. Server asked me how I want my burger done then tells the customer next to me that the burgers only come one way. Inconsistency. The fries were stale and chewy. The servers name is Robert at the bar. Attitude problem from *ell.  He automatically judged me for being in my 20s and told me if I don't have money walk up and down the strip and do nothing with my time. Very rude and unprofessional. I understand it's Vegas but coming from the perfectionist Gordon Ramsey cmon now. The server is what made the experience beyond terrible. I would've ignored the terrible fries had I had A+ service.",

Our waiter was very efficient and skillfully described the menu, including the special off the menu burger for the day. Everybody choose a different burger and everybody loved their selection. I shared with a friend and got to try the fish and chip burger as well as the farmhouse burger. Can't pick a favorite because both were on point and absolutely delicious. No one left anything on their plates.  We even ate all three orders of truffle fries and sweet potato fries.  I am glad I choose a very healthy (lol,not really) cocktail to wash it all down. This dinner felt like a splurge but was very reasonable. Burger prices ranged from $18-$25, which is very inexpensive for this quality and ambiance in Vegas. Thanks, Gordon.",

Mine was med well and it was cooked perfectly.  The bun (the unsung component of the burger experience) was really good and fresh.  The fries were meh - nothing special and it did not measure up to the burgers.  The fries were steak fries, which I'm not a fan of.  It comes with 2 house ketchups; ask for Heinz and they'll bring it to you. They have sweet potato fries, which comes with a shaker of powdered sugar and an aioli.  I'd go back when I'm in the area; it was good and not outrageously priced.",

    "text": "So I like Gordon Ramsay, from his television shows - Kitchen Nightmares actually has been my favourite of the bunch.  My wife is more of a Hell's Kitchen devotee as she is addicted to reality TV.  Gordon Ramsay Burger is located along the \"miracle mile\" at Planet Hollywood Casino.  It was our wedding anniversary and we waltzed in here at 1pm on a Wednesday with no wait.  Our seats kinda sucked though - located between the bar and the greeter's podium  As an appetizers we had the Kettle Chip Nachos.  They were divine, the combo of the shredded beef and sour creme, would make even the Cookie Monster a fan of nachos.  For our main my wife had the Backyard Burger and I had the Stout Burger.  I loved mine - it was probably one of the top three burgers that I can remember eating.  That said my one complaint is that its $16 US for a burger.  You don't get fries or salad with that.   Or in our perspective that's $23 CAD for a burger.  $15 CAD gets me a pretty good Burger, Fries, and Drink at Hero Burger.  Still a good meal was had by both of us.  Tip: you can pick up Sephora's free WiFi here.",

The food is incredible and previous experience so ill let our lack of service last night slide.   I've had amazing service and food every time I've been here. I talk about this place all the time and whenever I visit Vegas I make sure this is on the list to eat at. I love gordon Ramsay food so much. It's always cooked perfectly. Drinks are always crisp. And service is usually good.   Last night we had a terrible server. She was awkward and rarely stopped by. Our food and drinks took forever, I think she forgot to ring them in. My burger was cooked rare (as I ordered) so I know it doesn't take long to prepare. She had to have been one of the slowest servers I've had in a long time. She didn't even seem that busy which is what annoys me the most. It felt like the longest meal ever, and we only had a few burgers with drinks. Oh well. Like I previously said, service is always great here so this chick just sucks. Hopefully next time I visit she won't be around.   Anyways, I love Gordon's restaurants. Always great time and food. Tonight I'll be dining at Hells Kitchen and I'm super excited",

    "text": "Wanted to try at least 1 of Gordon Ramsey's 3 restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip on this visit to LV.   My husband and I were checking out the shops in the Miracle Mile and saw his Burger restaurant. It's located in Planet Hollywood.   It was around 8 pm on Easter Sunday and we got in line along the outside of the fire window, there were about 5 parties of 2 in front of us, it took around 30 min. before we were seated. The hostess was friendly and smiled yay!  This place was packed and super busy!   Noise level is loud, our waiter Andre said he'd be right with us. So we were admiring the modern decor and the British themed decor with several large pictures of Gordon Ramsey on the walls and video screens while we waited. The decor color was also British themed, Blue, Red, White. Andre returned and gave us an iPad which had the menu for the drinks, desserts and memorabilia.  Everything on the menu is ala cart, burgers are about $15-$20, the patty is 7 oz. My husband ordered the Guinness Stout Burger which he said was delicious! I had the Bleu Cheese Burger which was also delicious! We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries. also delicious and was hoping to have room for dessert but were so full.  There were 2 issues that we didn't care for. Our server seemed so rushed, to the point where he seemed irritated when my husband had questions regarding deciding on which cocktail to order and that for 2 burgers, an order of fries, a soft drink and a cocktail or bill was $80! But just to try it I was ok paying for it!",

    "text": "What an awesome experience!! The first time to one of Gordon's restaurants.  We started with the Street Corn Dip. A beautiful taste of corn, jalapeno,  cheese, lime and other flavors. The chips are very thin and crisp and just the right amount of salt and then the elope, the street corn is amazing, just a touch of lime, just a touch of heat it's my favorite. I'm in love in love with it. To ME it was absolutely fantastic!  Then we ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger. Oh my gosh what a mouth full of flavor. The meat was perfectly spiced. The roasted jalapenos were the perfect addition to an already perfect sandwich. I have read other reviews and dont understand the complaints of such an expensive burger. You are coming here for the experience and something you won't get anywhere else. It is something you have to adapt to. It surely isnt McDonalds. The burger with its roasted tomatoes and jalapenos are the best pairings. We split the burger and the fries. We had plenty of food but yet enougoh room for dessert.   For dessert we ordered the Stickey Toffee Pudding Ice Cream Sandwich. Oh boy, oh boy!! What a taste. Never have I had such flavors in my mouth as this experience.  I have had great steaks, lobster, pork chops, etc., and now I can add great burgers to that list.   Did I mention the fries? Holy cow!! The chipotle ketchup is to die for. I want to learn how to just make that! Again, a mouth full of flavor.   Daniel our waiter was on fire as well. He took great care of us.   If you have never been here, it is a great alternative to the more expensive Hells Kitchen.  GO!! That is all there is to it. You have to go.",

    "text": "Five full stars for the best meal of my recent Las Vegas trip! Even more enjoyable than the dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  I had some time prior to leaving and stopped by for a quick Sunday lunch. There is a sign outside that says open at 10:30 AM every day (Yelp info says 11). Right at 10:30 there was a line of 6 parties, but I was seated almost immediately without a reservation. Based on other line pictures on Yelp I recommend getting a reservation, especially for prime meal times. Each burger is made fresh to order and will take ~25 minutes to prepare. I selected the UK burger and it was fantastic. It is rather simple, just cheese arugula and a chutney, but the flavors combine so well. The cheese was Dubliner, never had before, comparable to cheddar but with character and a hint of sweetness. This sweetness played with the Major Grey Chutney, sporting mango and red peppers as two dominant flavors. This is topped with arugula, contributing some greens and a distinct bitter taste that contrasted to the sweetness of the cheese and chutney.  Very satisfied, would get the UK burger again, and I also want to try more of the burger menu too.  I finished the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding Ice Cream Sandwich, another great menu item. This is a reconstructed Sticky Toffee Pudding by combining the pudding and the ice cream into an ice cream sandwich. First, the two cake ends were sticky toffee pudding, and tasted just like the pudding available at Gordon Ramsay Steak. These were warm and had caramel sauce drizzled in top. The ice cream in between was brown butter ice cream, a must get, and also tasted like that at GR Steak. The ice cream on its own is rich, robust flavor from the brown butter, and then the sticky toffee pudding and caramel drizzle just add even more. I would easily choose this over getting a side of fries with the burger, no comparison and the perfect way to end the meal and savor the lingering taste in your mouth. I do though think the Sticky Pudding at GR Steak is marginally better as a full experience. In the sandwich form the bottom cake gets cold and saturated with melted ice cream. However at GR Steak the two components are separate and are only mixed right before going in your mouth, so the cake is always warm. Not a major difference since all the taste is there, just a texture difference.",

It was perfection. The meat came out at a perfect juicy medium with a salty crusty sear all around. The burger is the perfect texture of tender crumbles- not mushy or soft just perfectly tender pieces of meat. The toppings were spot on as well -- perfect quality to match the burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger definitely packed a punch so I took out the jalapenos to calm it down a bit. My sister in law loves spicy so she just added my jalapenos into hers! My husband had the turkey burger and it was insane!! Bursting with flavor and uber creative. I would come back to Vegas just to eat this burger again. The cons had nothing to do with the food but they were there--Service was definitely slow slow slow and everybody's fries came out at different times (some after we'd finished the burger) which was kind of a bummer but they were hot and crispy so no complaints. If you're hungry and can't wait 30-45 min then.. make sure to come before you're hungry :)) haha!",

I am a fan of Hells Kitchen and thought it would be fun to see if the food is cooked to perfection as it is supposed to be on the show. The burger was very good but I have had much better. Living in the south gives me an edge so I will say this is good for Vegas. The onion rings were exceptionally good. The meal was very filling to say the least so you get what you came for. My drink was pretty but just okay. I needed something soft after a long night of partying. It did the job. I would definitely come back!",

If you have a group of 3 OR MORE, DON'T WAIT IN LINE, INSTEAD GO TO HOSTESS AND THEY WILL JOT YOUR NAME DOWN (they have a sign out front that also has this information).   Once seated inside , I could smell the cigarette smoke from the casino. This is not an enclosed restaurant and there are casino games in close proximity which allows smoke to end up in eating area.   Not going to lie, when the food came out I was sad at how bare my plate was. Everything is a la carte so our french fries came in their own container... leaving my burger all alone on a big plate. When I took off the bun, the presentation of the burger was also a little \"blehh\". Thank goodness it tasted AMAZING! Don't judge the burger by it's presentation!",

I have been waiting to eat a burger here at Gordon Ramsay for a while. Walked past it and saw the lines wondering if it was worth it or just a tourist hype factory.   After about a 10 - 15 min wait, not bad at all, we were seated in the dining area at at table. It was packed and that is always a good sign. I could smell the grilled beef in the air. TV monitors all around with sports and of course larger than life posters of Gordon Ramsay glaring you down to see if you approve of his menu.   With so many choices on the menu for burgers my interest was peaked. Since it was my first time I wanted a baseline item for my palate to start with. The Backyard Burger looked just about right. I ordered it well and wondered if I would get feedback about it being dry from the waiter. Nope he obliged and placed my order. While waiting we had some Truffle Fries. These fries here were good, maybe not the best but very good. I would have preferred them in shoestring for more of a crispy fry.  After about 15 mins our burgers came out in a beautiful display. I cut it open to see the layers of condiments and the beef. It looked and smelled very fresh and savory. Ok time to dig in. I have to say this had to be one of the top 2 burgers I have ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly. Still juicy and had a slight char taste to it like it was grilled over fire at least some of the way. The cheese was very tasty and the flavor was strong enough to compliment the burger and not get lost in it. The veggies were cold and crisp. The bun too stood on its own. Kind of a sweet bread but I was really pleased it had a flavor of its own too. It was a pretty big burger but I had no problem devouring it up.   Drinks were standard. Vodka soda was a good pour. Service was very hospitable and we were checked on frequently. Professional staff. I kind of wanted to see Gordon run in the kitchen and throw a plate against the wall or something - haha. That would be amazing. Like a dinner and a show! Maybe for a special guys, cmon. LOL    Defiantly worth the wait and lived up to the hype of the Gordon Ramsay name in my opinion. Now I do want to try more of the unique burgers next time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "AMAZING BURGERS. Probably best quality burgers I've ever had.  We visited around 9:30 pm on a Thursday with a group of 6. Luckily because we had group of more than 3 people we had a much much shorter wait. There was a line for groups of 3 or less, but it wasn't too bad.  Our server had our drinks and food ordered in no time and thoroughly explained the different burgers. He was nice, quick, and very attentive.  Honestly I never watched any of Gordon Ramsay's shows or was really interested, but I just heard about his restaurants in Vegas. So that is how we visited out of curiosity, because like we would settle for an In N Out burger anytime. So it was our first time spending this much for some burgers.  We already had an early but light dinner, so we decided to share burgers and fries. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, Hog burger, and the Backyard Burger with an order of both the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Onion Rings.  The burgers overall were just amazing, patties were really juicy and flavorful. The Hell's Kitchen burger has a slight kick to it but not that spicy. The Hog burger tasted better than I thought and the onion rings were on point! The truffle fries were also really great. Portions were pretty perfect in my opinion, meat patties were 7oz and fries were good enough for two people.  Although prices are a little steep, I think it's worth it. If you ever feel like eating a good gourmet burger at a restaurant, it wouldn't hurt to come once in a while.  Definitely recommend to try at least once! ;)",

To our surprise we were passed ahead of the line when she showed her Platinum Caesars Reward Card given to her by virtue of her 20 years of service in the U.S. Air Force.  This was our second visit to Burger, and we were highly satisfied with the quality of food both times.  For a more robust review we ordered Beer-Battered Onion Rings and two types of French Fries: Just Fries and Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The O' Rings were crinkled, dusted with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese, somewhat greasy but very tasty, and served with Chipotle Ketchup and Ranch Dip for dipping.  Just Fries were fairly traditional and supple skin-on lengths of potato, while the Truffle Parmesan Fries were the best, for the thick Truffle Aioli was filled with expensive truffles and simply outstanding.    My Backyard Burger with mushrooms added was barely medium rare as ordered but contained well-melted American Cheese, fresh Butter Lettuce and tomato slices, pickle chips, and White Onions on a soft Sesame & Poppy Seed-dotted Brioche Bun.  And I learned that the 7 oz. meat patty was a great mixture of chuck, brisket, and short rib.  I requested and received mild yellow mustard and house tomato ketchup in small ceramic condiment containers to further enhance the flavor of my burger.  Diane enjoyed a medium rare Ultimate Cheeseburger with slices of Dubliner and Provolone Cheese, sharing the sides of fries.  Service by Katherine was excellent, accommodating, and friendly.  Seating was comfortable, with cushioned seat bottoms.  And, hard-driving piped in background music added to a pleasant ambiance in the brightly lit dining room.  Rating against like establishments, this was a five-star burger experience.",

I'm talking making my husband and I watch anything Ramsay related when we are eating dinner. It must be Ramsay.. That being said, my expectations were incredibly high due to his shows and his passion. I was not disappointed.   At first, we had to wait for maybe 10 minutes outside as there was a line and I was told they didn't take reservations. The line can look a little intimidating but it moved super fast! So make sure you stick the wait out. The atmosphere is very nice. From the burning fire sign of the restaurant to the set up the dining table when you are seated, it's all apart of the experience. Our server was incredibly nice and she was super helpful with menu suggestions. She suggested an option for $20 you get to take home a signature glass if you order certain types of drinks. My husband ended up going with that.   Now to the best part, the food! Since it was my birthday we went big and started off with the kettle chip nachos. Delicious! The beef was so flavourful and the English cheddar cheese sauce was to die for! Heads up, it was so filling! Now on to those perfect burgers. We both ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. Everything was perfectly balanced and It was so filling! I mean I don't like tomatoes and I ate EVERYTHING on this burger. The roasted Jalapenos and tomatoes legit made this burger. By the time I was done, I was so stuffed I felt like I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant. Luckily, we chilled for a bit and were able to walk out ourselves. In short, I loved this place and when I'm back in Vegas- I will be back!",

It was fresh and had enough to share. The burger was tasteful and packed with all the spice and hot flavor if you're looking for a kick in the burger.   The sweet potato fries were a little disappointing. I was sad to see the fries loose it's hold after about 5 minutes and the flavor was just kind of mediocre. They gave us this green sauce -- honey jalapeno?--that wasn't my favorite.   I would have liked to have paid less for the burger as well and the service was okay.

The Just Fries are \"just fries.\"  The Truffle aioli was decent. Order that on the side with the \"Whataburgeresque\" spicy ketchup. The Truffle Parmesan Fries don't justify their $4 difference.   Our server did not get our order correct, even with the use of the handheld restaurant iPad. My guess is that our order was also delayed given that the people who sat down after us got their food almost immediately after us.   Given chef's affinity for perfection, I was shocked that the service wasn't good, especially using a computer table side.   I think I would just stick to getting the burger to go and trying the onion rings.",

He had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I had the Crown Burger. We also split the Parm Truffle Fries.  -Fries: Very delicious although they tasted similar to other parm fries I've had before. The two dipping sauces were amazing and you could tell it was made in-house. -Crown Burger: super juicy and thick patty. Did make my bottom bun soggy but this is probably because I ordered it medium-rare. The sauce on this burger was unbelievable. Arugula was a little overpowering (but I'm not a huge arugula fan in the first place)  The reason I marked it down a star is because while most of the staff was helpful/friendly, we were sat at the bar and the male bartender was pretty rude. He dropped the iPad menu of beer selection in front of us without saying a word and generally had an unpleasant tone most of the time. I'd definitely come back, or try another GR restaurant.",

    "text": "An unfortunate experience at a restaurant bearing the name of one of my absolute favorite television chefs.    I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday and was looking forward to trying Chef Ramsay's Fish and Chips \"burger\" sandwich.  We went inside and there was a bit of a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  I really liked the ambiance of the place right away and thought the flaming \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\" sign was stunning. The food, however, was less so.   We got the burnt ends poutine, which was decent, but lacked salt.  We were starving so we were able to get through it, but I was rather disappointed (especially given the bar that had been set after eating at Chef Ramsay's new Hell's Kitchen restaurant).   The real disappointment was the fish n chips sandwich. Chef Ramsay would have no doubt thrown this thing at the chefs.  It was absolutely bland, completely lacking flavor.  I thought maybe I just got a bad bite but tried again from the other side and simply had to send it back.  It lacked even salt. The fish batter tasted like nothing and even the \"chips\" (which were small shoestring like fried potatoes) tasted of air. Additionally, the batter wasn't crisp but was soggy and thin.   The bartender sent it back and said that he would ask them to batter it more. He suspected maybe they just battered the fish too lightly.  Sadly, the second was just as bad as the first. The manager came out and I asked him to taste it, but he said he was not allowed and asked me if I would like anything else.  I told him I didn't have time to order a third item and needed to leave (we had been there for over an hour and a half at this point).  He apologized and the chef also came out asking for feedback. The chef said since it was the end of the night it was possible that we'd just gotten to the \"bottom\" of the batter which would lack seasoning (I thought this to be an odd statement).   The management was very genuine and seemed to care, which was nice, but the food quality simply is not up to snuff for a restaurant bearing the name of Chef Ramsay.  Truthfully, I'd rather have eaten a McDonald's filet of fish sandwich.   That said, my friend got the house burger and he said it was pretty good. He told me it was essentially average (not anything to write home about), but said that it wasn't bad.   I'm hoping this place can get it together. Chef Ramsay has some great restaurants and I'd hate for someone to eat here and think that the others are the same.  Truthfully, they should just use the same fish and chips recipe as Gordon Ramsay Fish N Chips does over by Linq.  That's the quality I was hoping for. 2 stars.",

BUT...the taste and enjoyment of the blend of flavors differ vastly depending on the type of burger you get, obviously.   It being my first time there, of course I had to try the \"Hells' Kitchen Burger\". While the meat itself was good, the other flavors were so bland that they might as well not have been there at all. For example, this burger featured roasted jalapenos and jalapeno pesto aioli. The jalapenos had all the seeds removed and I think were soaked in water for such a long period of time that all the spice was removed as well. It tasted like nothing but plain ground meat (it's not like this is a high quality steak; I need something to compliment the patty!). This burger tasted like it was seasoned with the little bit of salt that fell astray from Salt Bae's hands. For $17, I was definitely underwhelmed.   I also had the \"Foie Burger\" - a medium rare patty layered with some fatty foie gras. Now THIS is a burger worth $22. So creamy and fatty, absolutely perfect after a night of debauchery. I for sure will get this again for my next visit!",

It is well worth the wait. For parties of 6(?) or more, you can put your name down and receive a text when your table is ready. I believe smaller parties have to wait in a line on the side of the restaurant.  Food takes about 30-45 minutes to come out but, boy is it worth the wait! All the burgers I tasted were juicy and full of flavor. My favorites were the Turducken and U.K. Burger. If I could do half of each, it would be perfect. The flavor of the Turducken could get quite boring after a while. I really disliked the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The parmesan was soooo overpowering (smell and taste wise), it kind of made me want to gag. Sweet potatoes and onion rings were a hit. Service was exceptional! Definitely exceeded all my expectations.",

The Turducken burger has a tiny piece of duck, size of the tip of your thumb, on a turkey patty and the Cherry Chicken burger were small and very little taste.

Located near a central entrance in Planet Hollywood you can't miss it - it's quite flashy on the outside.  There is almost always a wait but if you have more than 2 people in your party you can put your name down and come back when your table is ready.  For parties of 2 or less you have to actually stand and wait in a line - which seems very odd to me.  The truffle fries - AMAZING.  Seriously a must order, especially if you've never been here and it's a 1 time thing for you.  We also got an order of onion rings because we just had to know how good they were!  Could not finish this as the 3 of us each ordered our own burger as well.  I had the turducken burger - super delish.  If you're not a beef eater this is a great option.  It's definitely a big portion though so make sure you come hungry!  It is a bit pricey for a burger and fries, but it's about the experience and knowing you're eating Gordon's food!  I would actually come back here if I had the choice.  It's pretty much guaranteed your food will be good, even if the service is poor.",

We got the turducken burger with a turkey patty, fried egg, duck confit, kale and honey mustard spread. All the ingredients went well with each other and the runny egg yolk helped the burger from becoming dry.   The second burger was the Hell's Kitchen burger which had cheese, avocado, jalapeno, tomato and jalapeno aioli. It was little more well done than I liked and it wasn't spicy at all but overall still a good, juicy burger.   My fav dish was the poutine because it was super flavorful, the fries were well cooked and the smoke from the bacon and the pickled onions were on point.   My only complaint is that for the portion you get (which is a pretty tiny burger), it's $$$ but then again, we're in Vegas so i guess it's expected.",

    "text": "Farmhouse Burger (I ordered with side of figgy jam) was a great burger but next time I'd break out of the burger safety zone and get the Hells Kitchen burger or another unusual burger. The farmhouse was very good but too usual.  My sis got the Blue Cheese Burger has lots of flavor pizzazz.  Manchego along with blue cheese, fight ham, cider vinegar reduction, spicy menu.  BEST BUN on the planet. Totally great two day feast. Both of us brought half our burgers back to hotel. Good for late Breakfast and yes, that bun held up overnight!  Maybe we could eat only half our burgers because we stuffed ourselves with a rare treat of Truffle Parmesan Fries and Beer Battered Onion rings, both with sauces To Die For! Loved the chipotle ketchup and I don't like anything chipotle. Worth the calorie splurge.   We got a table immediately. On a Thursday around 6pm.  But there was a line forming when we left.  Service was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Would go there again.",

They emphasized speed, so they didn't check in on us or even clear the plates after we were done. They did drop off the check promptly.  I looked around the restaurant and saw a few other tables that had diners at them, as well as a stack of empty plates waiting to be picked up.  When we left, the restaurant was more than half empty and had a line out the door, so maybe they were understaffed?",

    "text": "It was a pretty damn good burger! Is it worth a 45-minute wait? Maybe not, but perhaps a pro-tip: there was a really long line, but a sign that said for reservations of 3 or more, to check-in at the hostess stand (or something like that). I'm not sure if this is how it works for all reservations, but we were able to leave our name, wander the shopping area and be texted when the table was ready, so that was pretty easy.  Anyway, the burgers were great, loved that they actually had a decent beer selection, the fries were pretty good, and the curry mayo actually tasted like curry!  The real reason for this review though is that our server was incredible. I looked at the bill to try to get her name, but it was super long and unusual and now I'm going to completely butcher it (should have taken a photo for memory's sake). It was something like Piattaporna (slight, Asian lady)... sorry Piattaporna, I should have written down your actual name.  We had a lot of weird needs for 3 people: one burger prepared without butter and dairy, one gluten free, probably more odd stuff I'm forgetting. She nailed everyone and made sure to repeat the requests as she dropped off the burgers. Pretty impressive for how completely swamped she was. When we ordered the fries with the curry mayo, we asked for regular mayo as well, which she brought along with two kinds of ketchup and another dipping sauce just to be nice. Super fast, friendly and professional. Deep down this may be a burger joint, but this lady was bringing first class service all the way.   Piattaporna, or whatever your name was, they better keep you around!",

The first time was with a big party and I think we only waited for 20-30 minutes, so not bad.  We got the ahi tuna sliders as an appetizer - it was really good. But heads up, it's only two sliders on the order! I got the Farmhouse Burger, which comes with cheese, bacon and an egg. My boyfriend says you should always get it done Gordon Ramsay style, medium rare. Delicious, juicy and flavorful! My boyfriend got the Hell's Kitchen burger and he said it was alright. We also shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries. SO GOOD. Definitely enough to share between a couple.   The menu has many other different kinds of burgers, even hot dogs and milkshakes. I saw a lot of tables order the onion rings too, and it smelled and looked so good!",

This is my second time here and the experience was just as good as the first. It's located inside of Planet Hollywood not too far from PF Chang's. This time, we did have to wait about 15-20 minutes in line before being seated. The last time...we simply walked right in. If you have a group of three or more, you will be seated a lot quicker than those with just two people. The service is fantastic! Not one complaint there.   As per usual, the burger, the fries and the drinks are AMAZING! The flavor is intense and the burgers just melt in your mouth! The fries are big enough to share (try the truffle fries). As expected, it's not expensive but it's not cheap either. A drink gets is $13 and the burgers are between $15-$30.    I would recommend the Crown Burger or the Backyard burger if you are looking for something simple. I'm definitely going to try the lobster and shrimp burger next! I hear great things about it!",

He kept making sure we didn't have any questions and was very quick. We ordered the Farmhouse burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were DELICIOUS. The farmhouse burger had a fried egg and savory thick bacon, and the Hell's kitchen had a slices of jalapeno and jalapeno aoli.  I highly recommend the truffle parmesan fries.

Upon arriving, we see the famous Gordan Ramsay sign lit up with fire behind it. We were super excited about trying this place out, especially after reading the reviews.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger medium rare along with the truffle fries. Nothing stood out about it. I've honestly had better burgers for a better price. I usually prefer avocado in my burger to be more guac style but here they cut it into slices for you. Also, there is tomato in it and it was cold and stood out (in a bad way) from the burger.   For the name, I expected better food. The price was decent since everything on the Strip is usually around there though.   Would I recommend or come back? No.",

We started with the Kettle Chip Nachos which were amazing. We were so hungry we didn't get a picture. I'm a picky eater and don't really like new things so this was definitely outside my comfort zone but I loved it. The cheese sauce was great and really good with the pickled onions. My husband got the Hells Kitchen burger and it was really really good. It wasn't too spicy and the taste was amazing. I had the Farmhouse burger and while it was really good, it was bland. It could have used some sort of sauce. It didn't even have mayo. If it had whatever sauce was on my husbands burger it would have been a million times better. The people next to us got the onion rings and I was pretty jealous. The looked really good.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that I'm always skeptical when going to a restaurant that has a lot of \"hype\" around it because of a celebrity chef. Will the restaurant live up to expectations? Is it hyped up because of the name behind it? Are you paying a considerable amount more for something that isn't anything special? I mean this is only a burger joint!  Well, Gordon Ramsey Burger was everything I hoped it to be!   I went in with my husband and a couple of friends on a Saturday around 11:45-noon. There are no reservations, it's first come first serve.  The line moves pretty quickly, it was about a 15-20 minute wait... and we were about the 5th party in line. Not bad!   I love that the menu is fairly simple. There are enough options, but it's not overwhelming! Extensive menus are a bit of a nightmare for any indecisive person like me! Haha!   We ordered beer battered onion rings to share as an appetizer. They came with two dipping sauces; chipotle ketchup and a cheddar ranch. The onion rings were cooked to perfection, flavored well and the cheddar ranch sauce was the perfect compliment to them! It was a great start to the meal!   For my burger, I wnt with one of the more popular options; the Hell's Kitchen Burger. O-M-G! That thing was amazing! It was topped with asadero cheese, avocado, roasted jalapenos, and roasted tomatoes. The patty was so flavorful... it would taste good plain, that's how good it was! Seriously, there was a party in my mouth when I devoured this burger!!! It was tasty, memorable, and something I would crave!   My husband got the hog burger and that thing was MASSIVE! It consisted of a patty made of pork and brisket, wrapped in bacon, topped with pulled pork, crispy onions, white cheddar, pickles, and slaw! What?! He LOVED it!  Our friends had the Crown burger and I think the backyard burger. They enjoyed theirs. We wanted to share a variety of fries, so we ordered the parmesan truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and the chips with curry sauce. The fries' portions are large and can be shared. Having 3 orders between the 4 of us was way toooo much. I would stick with the parmesan truffle or the sweet potato.   We also wanted to indulge in a dessert and shake. I ordered the chocolate caramel tart which was chocolate cream served with hazelnut ice cream, hazelnut crunch, and milk chocolate! Sooooooooo delish!!! I would recommend it. Our friends shared the Oreo creme brulee shake, they loved it.   Ambiance is lively. Service is excellent! And the food is tasty/memorable! If you're a burger fan, check it out...quality meat in the burgers and very tasty!",

Hubby and I both had the Hell's Kitchen burger with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato and we shared a Innis & Gunn. Our family shared sides of the beer battered maui onion rings with dips - parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip, sweet potato fries with vanilla powdered sugar and honey jalapeno mayo and the hand cut fries with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. Our burgers were perfectly medium-well and flavorful, the sides were crispy and it was hard to choose a favorite dip - they were all good. Our daughter had one of their yummy pudding shakes - the coconut pudding + strawberry shake + chocolate cookie - YuMmm!",

I saw lines forming in the morning to eat there at 11am.   I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, and it was damn tasty! Burger was cooked to a perfect medium as I asked, I loved the kick to the burger and the sesame seed bun was nice.   I also tried the truffle fries. They were good, but if you've had truffle fries before, this isn't any different.  The disappointment of the place was the drum menu and cocktail program. All of the cocktails sounded too sweet or too nasty. So many cheap beers too. Even our server commented that the cocktails were \"shitty\" and I didn't disagree with him based on the two I tried.   I actually recommend this as a place to snack. Get the burger, skip everything else, and eat a meal a couple hours later.",

Especially when Gordon's biggest grips on his tv show Kitchen Nightmares is the speed of service!) The fries were very good though! For the burger, I went with the Ultimate Cheeseburger, and I had them add bacon to it, but when I received my burger there was n bacon added to it! So if you order something like that to your burger CHECK IT FIRST! All they did was give me an option of either having it on the side- ya right! Had them take that part off on the bill! They should have offered something more- oh well. So wasn't impressed there, but the burger and the bread was very good!  My wife went with the Forest Burger with Duck Bacon, which worked real well! Maybe I should have had that one minus the mushrooms!",

Depending on the day, the wait time can vary. We went on Labor Day for dinner, and they told us it would be a two hour wait. They ask for your phone number, and text you when they are ready to seat you. Instead of 2 hours, we actually only waited one.  This wait time gives you time to walk around the strip, watch the bellagio water shows, or go back to your hotel room to relax.  *SERVICE*  The menu and utensils are nicely set on the table. Like any other restaurant, they have you order drinks then food. You can also order both at the same time. After we got seated, they gave us a few minutes and took our order. The burgers are made after you order, so they take longer, but not so long.  *BURGER;FOOD*  The burger is more expensive than most burgers BUT WAY UNDERPRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET! Wow, the flavors and just everything was amazing.   OVERALL I RECOMMEND :)",

I sat at the bar, slammed two pints of Las Vegas's finest tap water, and had my order taken before five minutes had passed by. I ordered the Forest Burger (tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon). I list those ingredients because they are the only thing that brought life to this burger. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare, and received a dry overcooked piece of meat that would have sent Gordon Ramsay himself straight to the kitchen to tell the cook it was \"as f***ing dry as a camel's a**hole in a desert storm\". Yeah, that's a real quote.   The toppings were stellar but the tasteless patty and sub-par meat quality are going to weigh this down to three stars.

I will be back to try something different.",

There was a nice variety of burgers and the server answered all our questions about the toppings with which we were not familiar.  Our burgers were super great. We shared a parfait for dessert which had fruit and two types of chocolate. Service was great as well. The atmosphere was very comfortable.  It was an overall awesome experience.",

    "text": "Yum, yum, yum!   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which includes asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto aioli. It was awesome! The combination of all the ingredients meshed well together, and the avocado was perfect in the burger.   But the WINGS THO. These were Deeeeeelicious! That buffalo sauce was perfect and not too sour with the perfect acidity, and the blue cheese sprinkles on top of the wings just completed the dish so well. The first time I came here, I ordered just the wings and had a bite of my friend's burger. He had some of the wings as well, but I just wanted to try everything since I love food.  However, the SECOND time I came here, I ordered the shrimp salad (which sucked so don't order salad) and since I wasn't satisfied, I ordered the wings. Since it was a bit much I asked for a box as well as the check since I was in a rush. I put half the wings (4 pieces) in the box, and devoured the other 4. But mannnn, I couldn't help myself and slowly but surely, I ate the wings one at a time from the box I was supposed to take home to my friend. I ate one from the to-go box and I was like, just one more. Then there were two left, and who leaves just two pathetic wings for leftovers? That's just rude giving somebody two wings, so I HAD to eat the rest... xD  Anyway, if you come here, get the wings and the burgers aren't bad too! I believe if you are a diamond or seven star reward card, you get to skip the line.  FYI both times I came here the food does take awhile to come out, so it's not the best place to go if you are in a rush.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Had to try Golden Ramsay for that one time! Located inside the casino, the line was super long even on a weekday so get here early! I believe if you have 3 or more people, you can bypass the line to the front and check in with the hostess. To be honest, I expected more from a restaurant named after Gordon Ramsay. Waitresses were nice but they were sort of unprofessional, talking about calling in sick and such. Also, the service was slow, I know it's busy, but it shouldn't take 10 minutes or so just to get our order in or to get water. Food took over 45 minutes after it was ordered, which was a bit long. I was looking forward to the chicken burger but they replaced it with some other burger, so I was disappointed. I ended up getting the cheese burger which was pretty good, I wish it came with a side of fries (which has to be ordered separately).",

I tried two burgers (turdunkin and ultimate), truffle fries, and the dark butter caramel shake. Overall the experience was nice, but not unique. Truffle fries were steak fries, perfectly cooked. The burgers were dry and very bland. The turdunkin was better but still dry. No pink in the middle. The shake seemed ordinary but a good touch! The reality is, this was not up to the standards of most Gordon Ramsay restaurants. Wolfgang puck wouldn't open a sub par restaurant, I'm not sure why Gordon Ramsey did. Not writing this review out of anger or anything. I'm happily full and staff was very attentive! However, I do think, kitchen had so many orders it affected quality.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and have watched just about every one of his shows so you best believe I'm hitting all of his restaurants!  Food is a solid 5/5. The kettle chip nachos with short rib was absolutely divine and something that I will be dreaming of. Everyone loved their burgers. I really enjoyed the forest burger. There was a perfect balance between the herby and peppery arugula, the creamy and salty cheese and the meaty mushroom and duck bacon. My patty was perfectly seasoned. The only thing that wasnt a complete success was the hog dawg. On paper it's perfect but the hot dog was too salty and there was just too much bbq sauce. The whole thing was a sodium bomb but personal preferences of course. My.neice in particular loved it.  So why the 3 stars? The service. Dear lord the service. When I first checked in, I had specifically stated that I had 2 kids with me. Later on, my mom also confirmed and reminded the hostess that we had 2 kids. Keep in mind that we had a diamond players card which means we should get priority seating (30mins instead of 1 hr) but still had to wait an hour. When we were finally shown to our tables they gave us a booth that would have not fit the 2 kids. You'd expect them to consider the situation and get us a table immediately right? No. We waited another 15 minutes as people with similar party sizes were led to their tables. We were given high tables and despite us repeatedly asking for high chairs weren't given any until our waiter provided an additional chair instead. At this time I notice other tables that could have easily been combined for my party to sit at. These lower tables would have been much more appropriate for the kids. What was super enfuriating though was that a hostess delivered a high chair to another EMPTY table even after we asked her for a highchair a second time. I was particularly annoyed that despite having us wait they weren't even cleaning up the table that they were about to sit us at until just before they seated us. The waitress literally stood at the side of the table while the plates piled up. I get that sometimes you need a break but you're keeping your customers waiting in plain sight of them. If you're not looking to immediately remedy a mistake at least try to make an effort to please us. Our waiter took forever to get our bill to us. We were trying to flag him down for ages and somehow he never saw us despite us being in his direct line of view. I have never experienced such horrible customer service before.",

They'll text you once your table's ready. When my party of 5 came on a Sunday, we checked in at 1:30pm and our table was ready at 2:15pm. By the time we sat down, our waitress - who seemed very unenthusiastic for having to work that day I might add - said the burgers would take half an hour to make. HALF AN HOUR! Our appetizers came out within 15min but our burgers actually didn't come out for another 45min. Imagine how hangry we were.  The Onion Rings and Truffle Fries are great to share with a group of people. The dips that each come with add a lot more flavor. They were both good but not great, I've definitely had better for less.  Forest Burger (mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon) - I loved the combination and it sure was tasty. I was intrigued when I saw the duck bacon but wasn't a fan when I actually tried it. There was no duck flavor and it tasted essentially like salty dried meat. Normal bacon would've made it better. However, the beef patty was delicious - probably the best I've had.  Farmhouse Burger (bacon, fried egg) - I personally liked the Forest Burger better but the 3 others I came with preferred this burger. They used normal bacon here which was a plus.   Bottomline: The food is good, but for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected more... and better service.",

When we ordered we were encouraged to order an appetizer because \"the burgers will take a while\". The appetizer didn't get to us until after the burgers arrived (about 10 minutes). We did the ahi tuna sliders - disappointing. Not a ton of flavor and the texture was off-putting.   The burgers were OK. I'd give them 3 stars if I was reviewing them separately. Not terrible, not great, definitely not worth the price.   The sweet potato fries were absolutely disgusting. The fries themselves were prepared well, but who in their right mind takes a sweet product, adds powdered sugar and then serves it with some disgustingly sweet dipping sauce that looks like snot? We didn't eat any of them, complained, and nothing was done about it by the staff.   Overall the staff was friendly, but one of the people we interacted with at the bar (where we sat) was obviously stoned. Have a little professionalism.",

This was our Thanksgiving dinner this year.  My older son and I came here because the younger son was acting up.  This was my son's choice.  I was game.  There was a bit of a wait for two, but not too bad considering it's Vegas, at early dinner time, on Thanksgiving Day.  When we were seated the server came over pretty quickly.  They have a pretty simple menu of burgers and sides, but all of the offerings looked very interesting.    They have a good selection of draught beers on tap.  I started with a Boddington's - delish.    For an appetizer, we ordered their take on nachos - kettle cooked potato chips topped with corned beef and smothered in a cheese sauce.  OMG!  Wow!  This was sooo good.  My son ordered the basic burger and I ordered the Hog Sandwich for our entrees.  My son really liked his burger.  He plowed through it like nothing.  My sando was pretty amazing.  It had a ground pork patty topped with pulled pork, bacon, and onion strings.  Whoa!  Porky heaven.  The only hiccough of the meal was that they ran out of two beers that I tried to order.  I ordered the first off the menu.  The server came back and told me that they were out, but he also brought two tasters.  I really liked one, so I ordered it.  He came back a few minutes later and told me they were out of that one too, but he gave me a free glass of his other recommendation.  I did not expect that at a big name Vegas restaurant, so all worked out fine.  Definitely a great place for a casual meal in Vegas.  Based on this experience, I want to try some other GR restaurants.",

I got the hog burger and when I got it, it was cold. Like it's been sitting for like a half hour. Luckily they offered to make a new one when I mentioned it (like I'm fine with it just being microwaves but whatever). I don't know if I'll go back honestly.  Don't get. Milk shake. Ridiculously expensive and come in y'all skinny glasses that doesn't hold much. We got ours and it was pretty much completely melted. For sure not worth $10.",

Don't get me wrong it is not bad, its just nothing about it stood out as actually being anything more than ok.   The hostesses  could really do a better job in the seating department side of things. I was there alone and the spot at the bar I ended up sitting at was the same spot that had been open for the entire duration of the 45 minutes I had to stand in line waiting for a table.   Overall this is one of those spots you go to so you can say you have eaten there, but once you have won't go back again.  I've eaten at other Ramsay locations before and based on the food taste and quality you would never know this was a Ramsay location.",

The French fries I ordered were $6 but plentiful and filling. Absolutely not a fan of the ketchup.

    "text": "I've been really excited to try Gordon Ramsay burger after hearing great things about it (and watching his show!) unfortunately, it was a bit of a flop for me and disappointed.   After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the Hells Kitchen burger, which was supposed to have roasted jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno aioli, asadero cheese, and avocado. Sounds spicy right? Not at all actually. I saw the roasted tomatoes and stuff in my burger, but it was not spicy at all. In fact, I couldn't really taste anything except for the avocado. Not even the jalapeno aioli that was supposed to be in the burger. I ended up just dipping my burger in the ketchup and aioli sauces we got from the Parmesan fries because it was so dry. This was really disappointing.   The second thing that was really surprising was what happened with my friend's blue cheese burger. While this burger tasted much better than mine, the kitchen somehow messed up and there was PAPER in the burger! I could not believe that there was actual paper that somehow ended up in it. We complained about it to our server, Elijah, and he was very nice and quickly corrected it for us and replaced it with a new burger. Shoutout and thank you for correcting the situation. I was just really surprised that this type of thing happened at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   I'll end the review on a good note with the Parmesan truffle fries - although I was hesitant about the $12 price tag, the fries were really good and you could taste the Parmesan and truffle sprinkled evenly throughout all of the fries. They come in a cone and sometimes because of that the seasoning may not be evenly spread out, but this was not the case at Gordon Ramsay, thankfully. I would have preferred the fries crispier, but they were still good.   Overall, the paper in burger thing was really the biggest surprise at this higher class establishment. That aside, the food was just okay to me and not mind blowing. The service was a saving grace and I appreciate everyone on the team who contributed to that!",

I don't mind paying a high price for food but when that high price doesn't meet your expectations it's really disappointing. If you want the experience to say you've dined at this place I recommend it , but the food taste and quality does not meet the expectations of the burger place owned by a culinary legend.",

Now to the service: 1. There is usually a long line outside the place to get in. The hostesses were not very efficient seating people. An open table was empty for 10 mins, which we could see, before they would decide to seat someone. 2. After being seated, we were waiting for a long time just to even get water. I had to ask another server to call someone to our table. 3. We ordered and I asked for water without ice. The server seemed to forget that very simple detail for 2 people. However, it took him another 10 mins to replace the water - just without ice. 4. The managers seemed to be doing nothing about this extremely slow service. They were just hanging out in the corners and chatting away. I guess they don't need good customer service since it has GR's name on it.  The food was great, but customer service is terrible. I would go back for the burgers. But the rating is for the whole experience.",

I really did not like the Duck poppers. there was no stuffing. It was only a red bel pepper. The onion rings tasted bland as well. honestly it was all bland. did not taste fresh. The burger was okay. I will admit the quality of the meat was satisfying but i don't know. I feel like it needs maybe some type of sauce, not to drench it but to add more flavor. like crap, adding ketchup will give it more flavor and i don't even like ketchup.  Our server was rude. We asked for a bandaid and she told us she would have to go to security to get one and shook her head and said \"so no\"   go to shake' shack.",

Apparently when you have a party of 3 or more, you can leave them your number and they will text you when you're table is ready vs less then 3 you just wait in this long looking line.  Either way it's a long wait.  When we got the text, we waited another 6 min for them to clean the table and finally we got seated.  Yay!  Most of us ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger because of our waiter's recommendation for first timers.  We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries and beer battered onion rings to share.  And Creme brulee shake and brown butter caramel pecan shake to wash down the greasy food.  The patty was melt in your mouth delicious!  I ordered medium rare and it came perfectly cooked.  My issue with the burger was that it was INCREDIBLY salty.  I recall a bite where it felt like I was eating salt straight up and could feel the crunchiness of the salt on my teeth.  Maybe the salt was spread on unevenly or extra was spread on after?  Had the same issue with the fries where it was just too salty.  The onion rings were ok but nothing to rave about.  I loved the oreo shake part to my creme brulee shake but it turns out to be overwhelming with creme brulee on top and on the bottom.  It was just too rich for me to finish and felt kind of sick sucking up creme brulee on the bottom.  I'd recommend just order the oreo shake without the creme brulee.  Everyone liked the pecan shake but I prefer something sweeter when it comes to shakes.  I think overall maybe I just had a really high expectation for this place and it really fell short for me: food and service.  I love Gordon Ramsay and I'm a huge fan of his show and it saddens me to write this review but   everything was just okay and no way in hellz am I gonna wait an hour and a half ever again for mediocracy.",

From the lack of hospitality that the staff gave and didn't tend to their job and patrons to the average quality fries it's not an establishment that I personally will not be returning.  From the start the bartender says \"burgers will take 30 minutes to cook\". Umm that should be your 2nd open line to your customers, we were so turned off at the bartender, I wanted to leave!!!!  The three staff at the bar was not busy at all both at the bar and drink orders from the floor, there was 8 patrons at a given time at the bar and the staff did more talking story, hands in their pockets, leaning on the back bar, and watching the game on the tv behind them. They should have been tending to us by refilling drinks, we shouldn't have to ask to have water and ice tea to be refilled when we didn't even get dinner yet?!?!  Very disappointed!!!  Staff need Real Life training and if Gordon Ramsay is going to portray a demanding way from his show then he should first take a look at real life happenings in his own restaurants.   Two stars given due to burger was good and tasty. Other than that I would've given this restaurant only one star.",

    "text": "This is the absolute very best burger restaurant or regular restaurant you will ever eat at. Waitresses are extremely kind, food is beyond delicious, and the price point is perfect for the food and quality. All the attention to detail from the plates, to the menus, to even the cardboard cup holders, it's absolutely amazing. If you sot at the bar, you can see the chefs preparing your food. They added TVs in the diner to play from all sorts of sports channels to view. Music is added to lighten the mood. The busiest time during the day is actually at night or around dinner time. Waits can pile up to 3 hours long, and the waiting lists are overfilled. Super spacious, and the perfect temperature to enjoy your food. Burgers are what the restaurant is known for, but there are also snacks, soups, salads, sandwiches, and deserts a plenty. The drink option is very wide ranged, and they sell bottled waters like Perrier and Fiji. Tables are bug enough for multiple dishes and for sharing. The lighting is also great for pictures, not too bright, and not too dim. And the best part of course, is that if you're lucky, Gordon may come to the restaurant for a usual visit. Five stars for this one. Shoutout to Devin who was our waitress",

Think YES people!!!  There are places more glamorous, with much better settlings, but if you want to get in and out quickly, have a shockingly good burger, and pay a reasonable amount then this is your place!  We all had different burgers, and we all loved them.  Ok, the chicken burger was undercooked, but the issue was rectified immediately, the item was removed from our bill without asking and the manager was great.  Good food, fast service and awesome fries!",

We did that last night because we were short on time and trying to make the Britney concert. You order from the hostess and pick up your food in about 30 minutes.   We sat in the casino sports lounge next door. I would totally do that again!  The tuna sliders had a lot of textures and flavors, I liked it. My favorite was the fries with curry sauce, I would get this again.  I want to try the portabella mushroom sandwich because my friend loved hers, she said it had the perfect flavor combination.",

    "text": "To be honest, I don't get why Gordon Ramsay BurGR felt the need to relaunch themselves.  A four star average spread over 5,400+ reviews seems like a damn good reason to leave well enough alone!  Not that it feels like much has changed.  In fact, we wouldn't have even known if our server hadn't mentioned it.  At the same time though, as modest as their remake was, the English/grammar nerd in me was pretty happy to see them put the \"e\" back into \"burger\" (yes, I get that the \"BR\" were for his initials...).  In all seriousness, the look and feel of the now-named Gordon Ramsay Burger is the same as before.  The only real changes I could see were with the menu; prices are $1-$2 higher (they don't have a discount for Total Rewards members anymore) and their burger offerings have been tweaked a bit (some have been altered, others seem to have been added/removed).  Thank goodness my friend was down to split a couple of burgers though; getting to try two burgers at the price of one = more bang for your buck!  -- TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES...$12 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=okbyfgMxoiyZiSlZd_iztQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>) In terms of taste, this was exactly as good as I remember - a decent amount of parmesan, the perfect amount of truffle oil, and all around delicious.  The fries were also just as crispy and flavorful as before, though the fries weren't cut as large this time around, which was fine.  -- HOG BURGER with Mangalitsa Pork, Mangalitsa Bacon, BBQ Pork, White Cheddar, Pickles, Crispy Onions, and Slaw...$18 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=_SbSCPmhzVn-y2K7aI4Osg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>) With pork on pork on pork, this burger sounded awesome to a pork fan like me!  Sadly though, this didn't amaze (good, but not amazing).  The pork patty was super juicy and flavorful, and I loved the onion strings and melted cheddar, but I didn't sense much of the bacon or BBQ pork.  Not sure though if it's because they were lacking or if everything else just overshadowed them.  -- FARMHOUSE BURGER with Dublinar Cheese, Mangalitsa Bacon, and Fried Egg...$16 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burger-las-vegas-3?select=lJrPb63uD2PTF9Xmti1I6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gord...</a>) Though the Hog Burger didn't amaze like how I had hoped, this was terrific!  Which wasn't surprising, given the classic combination of toppings - soft, lightly toasted buns, a well cooked patty, a runny egg, thick and flavorful bacon (in this case), and gooey cheese.  Definitely recommend this!  Name change aside, it was great how our experience wasn't far off from the first time around - terrific!  The menu options, the food, the service...all just as good, even despite prices being a shade higher (to be expected after four years!).  While I still want to check out Burger Bar next door at Paris, and even though I'd still give Holstein's a slight edge by comparison, GR Burger is as solid of a choice as ever.",

None of them really stood out...we decided we all liked the hog burger the most, but we could skip this place next time we are in town.  Surprisingly, we ALL really enjoyed the poutine.  It wasn't authentic poutine, but the flavors were awesome.  That mushroom gravy...delish!!",

If you have more than 2 people, you can put your name on a waitlist and they'll text you when the table is ready. I loved that so you can take off and come back. Made the wait super easy.  The quality of everything was soo great and I wouldn't expect anything less from a Gordon Ramsay place. Sadly I couldn't give this place 5 stars because our service was definitely not the best. Our waitress was a little delayed. I had asked for the alcohol menu (duh it's Vegas) which was on an iPad. She gave it to me and was missing for quite a while. I had to stop her and ask to order my drink. Then when we came to order, I and my mom, got the stout burger. I asked for the mustard on the side. When they brought it out, there was nothing on the side and a dry burger. Of course, she was missing again. So we asked a bus boy who was kind enough to go investigate. Apparently they were out of it... but had enough for my moms burger. Strange. He offered to bring me a couple sauces to try which I did. Apparently the kitchen was making a new batch. And when it was done they brought it out. At this point out I was mostly done with my burger but I was really glad that I did get to try it with the sandwich because it was sooo good! It definitely needed the mustard. Had I known asking for it on the side was going to create this fiasco, I would've just taken whatever they had left! But I wasn't given that option. My other recommendation would be to slice the mushrooms. There were literal whole mushrooms on the burger which was pretty difficult to eat.  The onion rings and French fries were soo good! And my boyfriend got the seafood burger and he loved it!  I definitely would return because I think my experience was just a fluke but I had high standards for a Gordon Ramsay place!",

Dry, bland, unsatisfying and over priced. I didn't eat anything for 12 hours before having the burgers, so I was ravenous when the food came. This level of hunger should bump up any food a few notches and add some bias to its deliciousness but they were bad and couldn't be helped. The truffle fries were okay, and the onion rings were not edible! They were soaking in oil and impossible to eat, and left completely untoucheThree burgers, fries and onion ring came out to about 80$ before tip. This was indeed a sad meal",

We have been to several of Gordon Ramsay's locations throughout the years: STEAK at the Paris, pub and grill, and his fish and chips establishment.     We didn't stay to eat this time because of this...  We were received by hostesses that were McDonald's quality.  We stood in line for 44 mins exactly (after speaking to a hostess to see how long the wait would be) when we reached the end of the line (yes, there was a line) the hostess told us we had 45 more mins to wait!!  The hostess blamed us!  She told us it was our fault because we didn't speak to a hostess before standing in line. I told her we did. And an ocean of excuses poured out of her mouth, none were apologetic. I expressed to her that we've been waiting for 44 mins already and my parents are diabetics... she said ok and walked away.  I asked for her name, she walked right passed me, TWICE!   I had to go to the bar to ask for the manager.    I spoke to the manager, Joe Rich, he did not care one bit!  I expressed to him that we have been to several of his [Gordon Ramsey] restaurants and not once have we been treated this way.  He simply said \"have you been seated yet?  Are you going to allow us to serve you?\"  No apology, nothing!  I told him \"well we would be seated regardless...\".  He replied, \"ma'am you're Getting loud, we need to step outside\".   Long story short, if this is a reflection of him [Ramsey] It is poor.  I have seen his show and the hostess and manager were \"idiot sandwiches\".",

Patties tasted just like the frozen Sysco patties you get at crap restaurants. Mushy, super greasy onion rings. Fries tasted like they were fried in old oil and dropped on the floor. Even after getting one burger taken off the bill, still paid over $70 for crap food and slow service. The waiter did the best he could, but was stretched thin due to the lack of wait staff. To add to this horrible experience, even the glassware was chipped. Very disappointed because your steakhouse was amazing and expected the same from this place.",

The waiters were very attentive and quick.  I can't remember the burger I had  and I'm not a burger person so I almost just did a side but super glad I didn't! My burger patty was wrapped in bacon with onion rings and so much more! It was so huge I couldn't bite it, had to cut my burger up to enjoy it but so well worth it.  You wouldn't hear me recommend waiting 2 hours for a burger however this place is in exception to the rule, and is worth the wait.",

Wished it had more spice to it. Burger was juicy and liked the roasted flavors. Tried the garlic parmesian fries and they were ok. Bit too salty for my taste, but the dipping sauce balances it. Overall, it was good but was hoping for better for a restaurant with the namesake.",

I end ordering the \"hells kitchen burger\" medium. It's probably one of the best burgers I have ate, the meat was perfect and had a lot of flavor. Burgers do not come when sides so you have to order your own sides. I ended up getting the truffle french fries and onion rings. The fries where really good but what caught me by surprise where the onion rings! Wow the onion rings where really really good must try.",

Most recent visit my wife and I were on a mission for their milk shakes.  Last time I recall there being a larger variety but on the most recent trip there were ultimately 3 but really 2 with a variation on the shake.  Shakes are multi-tiered, bottom part is the ice cream shake, mid level is a pudding and topped with house made whip cream.  They are phenomenal and I'm very glad that they aren't in Dallas or I would be in trouble.   We had the farmhouse burger and regular fries split between us.  Both were great and the house made ketchup with chipotle was superb.   Only downside, burgers were taking 35 minutes to make.  Waiter sat down to advise that typically they are about 15 minutes but they were down a chef and the wait time had more than double.",

Because of this, my expectations were high going in. Ambiance is awesome, lots of TVs with sports on. Menu had great choices, including different types of meats like pork and chicken. Prices are reasonable especially if you think about where and what you are about to devour lol. Ordered an app, duck poppers, good but for 14 dollars I expected more flavor. Probably wouldn't get those again. Burgers were juicy, well constructed and delicious and exceeded my expectations.  Bun was soft, toasted and airy so it didn't overwhelm the ingredients within the sandwich. Sides included fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. All very good. The sauce with the sweet potato fries was aaaamazing.  Over all well with the wait to get in (15-20 min) and wait for the food to arrive. Definitely going back, and definitely recommend everyone get a burger from here.",

    "text": "Amongst the glory and glamour of all the dining ventures sprawling across the strip, each vying for your attention, this was one of the better ones that were open late (We went around 11 pm).  Decor : Fancy ambiance meets English pub vibe! You could see this place is a notch classier than your average burger joint (Well IT IS Gordon Ramsey one so there's that!)  Service : Once you ARE seated, it's pretty nice but the fact that it's Vegas and was a Weekend, there was a waiting queue. Here's where it gets hit down. You see for some reason, they were giving priority to large groups regardless of when they show up, over the Couples or Singles who had been waiting there for more than 20 mins!! I get the business nuance of this approach but it's very customer unfriendly!  Food : Thankfully, the food here is quite good! We ordered a Hog Burger and a Mediterranean Burger.  The Hog burger was a size-able beast! The patty was chunky but very juicy. I loved their crispy onion that gave that crunch to all the meat. Speaking of meat, I wasn't a big fan of their bbq pork and think the burger could have done without it. Still, a very upscale burger for sure!  The Mediterranean one decent at best. The lamb was tasty albeit a bit dry (Lamb burgers are notorious for that!). Feta cheese was a great accompaniment to balance the flavors and off course, lend it that Mediterranean feel! This burger however was a tad smaller than the Hog and could have done with a little more.  Value : For almost $20 a burger, this isn't your average burger joint or even a better one. The Hog was certainly worth the price. I'd say give this place a try atleast once, especially if you dig ala carte versions of Burgers!",

I was alone, and had to wait in their line with other folks that were parties of 1 or 2. The line was about 20-30 people and took roughly 25-30 mins to get through. I was seated on a table, and immediately knew what I wanted. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium well. I was debating on fries as a side or something else, and I'm so glad I opted for the street corn dip. It was so delicious! The chipotle seasoned chips were a great item to have with the dip. I can't say enough about the burger. I've had soooo many, and this was hands down the best burger I have ever tasted. The meat was cooked perfectly, the melted cheese was the perfect touch, and the avocado and spices gave it that unique kick. I shouldn't be surprised that the wait was quite a while, however I was also trying to get a table with no wait on a Friday night around 10pm which is probably unheard of. I would HIGHLY recommend this spot to friends, and my next trip to Vegas I will try my best to make it back out here.",

Every time I go to Vegas I always stop by here it was always one of my fav to go spots but after this memorial weekend trip they disappointed me so much. I love Gordon Ramsey's restaurants from his steak house at the Paris to the pub at the Cesars and to have this spot change so drastically on taste and menu is such a disappointment it really doesn't uphold the Gordon Ramsey name brand",

I don't know what ingredient did it; but I'd love to know so I could do an \"elimination diet\" experiment with the ingredients. Overall, I'd give it four to five stars if it wasn't for loud atmosphere and wear in the restaurant.",

The ketchup and other sauce is unique and they make a great pairing.  In terms of the burger, I got the one with an egg in it. It was super juicy, flavorful, and while I have no complaints it was nothing special (unlike the onion rings).  So if I had to recommend this place, I'd say make sure to definitely get the onion rings! The burgers are big enough to split with someone so that's also an option I recommend. I'll be back here no doubt about it.",

The venue is wide open with glass as walls so you can see in and out.   We were sat pretty quick which was surprising considering some of the reviews I read.    Menu had all the staples of burgers, 'chips' and apps along with a full bar with a pretty good beer list.  Nice listing of cocktails too!  We started with the Street corn dip.  Pretty tasty but not the best we have had.  In fact I think our homemade is the best!   I had the Hell's Kitchen burger with avocado, toasted tomato and jalapeno with a jalapeno aioli with asadero cheese.  This was really good.  Lots of good flavors.  It was a little under cooked and I should have sent it back but ti was so good I couldn't stop eating it!  Although this was really good I have to say it did not knock my socks off, like Hells Kitchen did.  The burgers are real good don't get me wrong but I have had amazing burgers and these were good but not amazing.",

We had to wait 45 minutes to get seated and there is a line a long line to get seated.  Once the hostess came to get us and as we entered the restaurant we saw there were plenty of empty tables. It's a great strategy to make people wait outside so anyone walking by would think it's really busy and the food is amazing.  Our server Jonathan was on top of his game. I would say he was the only best thing that we experienced in this restaurant. We had Hell's and portabella burger and it was just okay. It looks great but taste was not that great and not worth the 45 minute wait. 5 guys have better burgers.",

This can be a little off-putting.  The Hells' Kitchen Burger is really good. The quality of the beef is definitely what sets this place apart from other burgers. It's cooked and seasoned perfectly, the ingredients are all fresh and it's a solid gourmet burger. It looks a little lonely on the plate all by itself though; I think they do that to make it stand out on it's own but somehow that just doesn't feel right with a burger; every good burger needs a friendly side.   Overall the food is great and worth the wait to try it out if you haven't done so. Definitely not the best burger I've had but right up there among the top ones for sure.",

But when it was 1230, there was a line outside. Lol.  I had the Hog's Burger ($19) (biggest burger they have). The patty a mix of pork and beef. Some BBQ pulled pork, bacon, crispy string onions, cucumbers, melted cheese. I ate it with tabasco and it was great. The burger was tasty and hearty.   I tried my friend's Hell's Burger ($17) (most popular burger there). It had some avocado, tomatoes, roasted aioli, grilled jalapenos. It wasn't spicy. It had a nice refreshing taste, eating it until the end was a good, fresh experience.  Prices were a bit high IMO. I guess they can sell it based on Gordon Ramsey's name. Yeah the burgers were great, but not worth $17-19 IMO.   Staff was prompt and polite. Will be back to try their Burnt Ends Poutine... but the burgers filled us up already. Also the Truffle Fries are good I heard. Next time!",

We had a GREAT server, Gregg and hopefully we'll have him the next time we go back. The Hellfire wings were flats without the extra bones and seasoned perfectly. Wings anywhere else seem like fast food now. We also placed an order to go for later on that night. My husband and I both ordered the Backyard Burger with an order of onion rings. The burger meat was exceptionally fresh, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I think those onion rings are the best that I've had-lightly breaded, cooked in FRESH oil and sprinkled with Parmesan. When we go back to Las Vegas this will definitely be our first stop after check-in!  Fabulous job, Gordon....\"Well done\"!!",

It get even busier if you go here on lunch time. There's long lines and service is slow. And servers needs to work on checking everyone not just taking orders. I know it's busy but I don't think it's a good reason for them to not refill my water.  Let's talk about FOOD! Ordered: Hog burger - all I can say WHOAW!! There's pork patty, bacon, bbq pork, and crispy onions. Sooo much meat! After three bites I'm damn full. Thank God my daughter is there I was able to half it with her. Mu daughter had the reaction too. Well, before that we had Burnt Ends Poutine. Burnt Ends Poutine - fries with poutine and gravy. It's really good. Sweet and lil a bit spicy. But the price I don't think it's reasonable because the serving is small.  Beer Butter Onion Rings - you can tell they use real onions. It's $9 price is good and they're good too.  Duck poppers - it think it was okay and it's expensive.The sauce are good tho. Also, the prices for the burgers is about right, they're huge and heavy.  ENJOY!! :)",

    "text": "So it's a burger place, what else can be said that thousands haven't said already?    It was worth it.   Burgers are really good. Just well crafted. Everything is made in house from the buns to the meat grind. My burger had oven roasted tomatoes that were super tasty, perfect amount of cheese, everything was made exactly as ordered, hot and timely.   The service was excellent, portions generous, price is high for burgers but not crazy- it is Vegas anyway and a brand name - so value is good.   I would imagine that if I came here again it would be spot on again and again. Consistency is what makes or breaks a good restaurant and this is a jeweled Swiss watch.   Only downer, fries were underwhelming, but I think that's just because they were not my fav style. They were big cut steak fries not super crispy.",

    "text": "I love this place and so does everyone else as made apparent by the line that is always there out front. If you have a party of 3 or more, you will need to tell the hostess and they give you a pager. However, I've always been able to stand in line since I've always been a party of 2. The line itself isn't too bad. I've been several times since Zappos Theater is right there and we need to eat before we listen to great performances right? The wait is generally about 20-30 minutes depending on how long the line is. You cannot bring any outside beverages in though as I was trying to sip on my malibu pineapple from the neighboring bar.  The Kettle Chip Nachos can a bit rich and filling if you start with that which we quickly found out after our burgers came out. The braised beef was tender, but it is definitely on the heavier side with the cheese and sour cream. I've tried the Lobster and Shrimp burger (yes, I know its a burger place) but it was appealing and tasted wonderful which is definitely a \"lighter fare\" if that's how you want to go. I ended up splitting it with my friend and we shared a salad and onion rings. Onion rings and the cheddar ranch dip...delish...the batter is \"fluffier\" than other onion rings that you may have ordered and yes, the ranch just has cheddar added to it but ranch and cheese are probably two of my favs. I've also tried the Forest Burger. It was good and of course you can order it however you like it to be cooked. I wasn't a fan of the duck bacon but that was easily fixable.   Overall, service has been up and down for me, but the food is delish. I would definitely return!",

Our wait was about 30 minutes, which is pretty typical? We sat and our server was very attentive and polite. We sat near the kitchen so I was able to see the chefs in the back whipping up the meals, which is a fave of mine. Food took a little bit but again, they were slammed! The fries were thick and not overly salty. The burgers were amaze! Prob one of the best burgers I've ever had! Flavorful, moist, cooked to order- just so good.   If you can wait for good food, put this one on your list!",

Don't let this discourage you.  If you have a party larger than four call ahead!   Service here was great.  From entrance to exit, staff was smiling and eager to assist.  Our waitress was super nice and didn't mind my barrage of questions about the owner.  Lol.  I know I am not the only one that did that, so don't roll your eyes. It's always nice when the staff speaks so highly of the interaction with the owner when the owner is a celebrity.  She had nothing but glowing things to say. That made me feel good about spending my money here.  I digress.  The food lived up to my expectations! The nachos were delicious! My burger was cooked perfectly with the right amount of condiments to make it ideal.  Fries were hot and fresh with just the right amount of salt.  Come here with the expectations of spending a little money.  Don't think you can come here on a McDonalds budget.  However, the cost is worth the quality.  I'm not disappointed in the least!  That's my $.02 and I hope it helped in your decision making process.",

We got Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Turducken Burger. The Hell's Kitchen Burger was cooked well and had really great flavors. There was something about the sauce that was so addicting. The Turkducken burger was pretty good too, but I couldn't really taste the distinction between all the meats (turkey, duck, chicken). This one was not as tender and didn't have much flavor. We also got the poutine, which was pretty good. The gravy had so much flavor and we couldn't stop picking it even when we were full.  Overall, I felt that the burgers were good quality and tasty.",

I suggest sitting at the counter, right infront of the kitchen so you can watch all the cooks in action! Easily one of the best burgers in town, however, it all comes at a price. A burger, fries and a beer will run you close to $45 so I knocked it a star for price. Plenty of other delicious burgers in town for significantly less! Other than that, it's worth a try if you're a Ramsay and burger fan! @theworsttourguide",

I just ordered the Guinness Stout Burger.  I was still so full from lunch but I wanted to squeeze one last meal in before leaving vegas.  I saw a guy next to me with fries and it had powdered sugar on them??? and so naturally I asked what the flip. I realized they were sweet potato fries and he offered some to me. Yay. Dipped it into the honey mustard looking thing but it tasted like custard. It was so good. This tasted straight up like a dessert dish. yummm... It was a honey aioli.   The burger. The bartender said that their rare was extremely rare so I thought medium rare would be good... but it was cooked to maybe more of a medium. It was kinda dry... Basically just tasted like a mushroom burger to me. Nothing amazing... I just liked that it had a ton of mushrooms. Not the best burger I've ever had... not the worst... but for a Gordon Ramsay establishment I expected more.",

I got the farm house burger and my friend and I split the truffle fries. Delish burger! The bugger had this delicious cheese, bacon and egg and everything blended together into a delish dish. The truffle fries were also amazing and came with two dipping sauces.   Much better food and dining experience compared to his restaurant I went to in Atlantic City.  My stomach did hurt alittle after I ate the meal but I think it might have been a combination of grease and heat. Still amazing burger and I'm happy we got to try it when we were out in Vegas !",

The poutine was also delicious, if you don't mind pepper (it's a REALLY peppery gravy, but intended. I did like it). The service is good, nice, not too annoying but also check up to make sure all is well. The price is what you can expect for.... Anything in Vegas. Except here it's totally justified because this wasn't some burger you'd get from your local Denny's (no offense to Denny's) it was definitely on a different level. But still overall not a bad price. The burger we got was 17 dollars, which is basically usually the price of a burger AND fries. Here it's literally just the burger. Highly recommended if you want to experience a good burger.",

I ate around the outside and it was good. Wish it would have been cooked properly so I could enjoy it as I am sure it would have been good.  Too hard to track server down to get it cooked.   French fries were good.  Server was busy however, none of us ever got drink refills including water.  For me I've been there done that, no need to go back.    $36. For burger fries soda and tip.   Loved the vibe, great plates and cool signage.   If you like burger medium this is the place, just order it well and it will arrive medium",

    "text": "The selection of meats was surprisingly varied. They went beyond your cow and pork, offering turkey, lamb, chutney, and the \"impossible\" vegan burger. There were a lot of fancy cheeses with French names, too. I got the Mediterranean burger, which had lamb and blue cheese. The taste combination was definitely unique and gave the burger a nice savory flavor unlike anything I've had before. The Mediterranean burger is made medium rare as a standard. Though it was too pink for my taste, the kind and attentive server had the cook whip up a new one medium well for me. The truffle parmesan fries and chocolate creme brulee shake were the highlight for me, and that's why I'm giving them 4 stars. A place called BURGER should not leave that impression.",

There was hardly any line when we arrived. But after leaving the restaurant I noticed there was a long line of hungry people wanting to eat.  I had always wanted to try a Gordon Ramsay place, and this place is True to his name.   We ordered Portobello burger and Truffle parmesan fries. Each of the fries had the perfect seasoning and right quantity of cheese. It had a perfect crust and was so flavorful. Each of the fries felt just melted in my mouth. Wanted to curl up can use them as my blanket and sleep Loved the burger too.. they perfect just perfection..  Place is definitely worth your money and time.",

This ranks up there with one of the best burgers I've ever eaten and the burger patty is the best I've tasted.  It was like eating a perfectly tender piece of steak.

I would recommend coming here for lunch & arriving a couple minutes before it opens!  Let me just start by saying the ambiance is beautiful in this restaurant. The fire at the entrance lights up the whole room. The staff was friendly & gave service with a smile which is always a plus. Everything from the moment we walked in was amazing.  The food was the best part! We started with appetizers - onion rings & the mushroom poutine. Delicious! The onion rings were light & the flavor was so good. The cheddar ranch dip was the best pairing to dip the onion rings in. The mushroom poutine was savory & delicious one of my favorites. If you love mushrooms you'll love this dish! I ordered the ultimate cheeseburger, the different cheeses gave it such a kick! My husband ordered the hog burger & loved it! We also ordered the lobster & shrimp burger & that one was my favorite! Portions were a good size. Timing didn't take long since we ordered appetizers first.  They don't have a kids menu, but if you ask they offer to make a grilled cheese or a normal hot dog. We ordered our 1 year old daughter a grilled cheese & I can guarantee you I'll never be able to top that.   We will definitely be back!",

I hyped it up for myself, next time, I'll just stick tot he buffets or something.",

The best burger ever, and the price is decent. It doesn't come with fries, but the side order of fries is shareable. I recommend medium burger, it's juicy and soft.  The only reason I didn't give 5 starts - when we watched Master shef, Gordon Ramsay yelled at one of the contestants for making french fries that were not exactly all same shape. He said it was absolutely unprofessional. Well, you should know that in his own burger place all french fries are DIFFERENT, the most different shapes we have ever seen. I wouldn't care, but he was the one to insist on it.  Definitely check this place, enjoy your burger.",

I love a good burger, this place has big but underwhelming burgers. I've had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, the Hog Burger (separate occasions), the fries, and the onion rings.  The taste blends together too much. It's just a hot mess of meat and bread. They have few sauce selections. The house ketchup is too pungent, and the ranch is a cheese ranch, too much on the cheese flavor. Nothing fresh that cuts through the burger flavor.  There are much better burgers nearby. Don't let the fire display distract you, I think this place has little to offer in terms of special Vegas experiences or in a special dining experience.",

We ultimately chose the following: - hell's kitchen burger - bleu cheese burger (pictured)  - sweet potato fries  Oh man... I am dreaming of those fries, they are amazing! Please please do yourselves a favor and go to this burger joint, you won't be disappointed.   We came in hangry and left overwhelmingly delighted. Damn you, Gordon!! Can you do anything wrong?",

    "text": "got the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($17), which was cooked perfectly (medium rare, as requested), an order of their regular fries ($8), and the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad ($15).   As burger joints go, this one was actually pretty standard (compared to Au Cheval in Chicago, or even Five Guys), and the real taste probably came from the ingredients themselves, not the way they were prepared. That being said, it's pretty hard to go wrong with a burger, and the patty itself was pretty well cooked but didn't really give it the OOMF that separates a good burger from a great one.   Salad was...okay, but looking back I probably should've tried another burger (the wheat berries and all the fruits in there made the taste quite strange)  Of course, I could've had the one \"off\" burger of the night, as this place is cram packed with at least a 1hr -1.5hr wait during dinner, and they must've been churning out burgers by the dozens. Still, if I gotta be 100% honest, Cheeseburger+Cajun Fries at Five guys for much less money vs the Hell's Kitchen Burger at Gordan Ramsey....taste-wise and value-wise, Five Guys wins xD (insert a Buzzfeed video haha)",

    "text": "Burgers burger burgers      With burgers being one of may favorite foods.      Gordon Ramsey burger located inside planet Hollywood was my favorite burger that I had while visiting Vegas. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the service was great. We sat at the bar because if you want a great experience at any restaurant sitting at the bar has always been great for us. They had a few bartenders which was great to see because everyone was taken care of even with the huge dinner crowd that came in while we were there.       At 18 dollars a burger it better be good right? Well it was and we weren't disappointed with our choices. I of course picked the spicy jalapeno burger and dh ordered the breakfast style burger. Can't remember the actual names of the burgers but they were delicious. So many fancy names on the menu I though using a description of what was on it would work. We had the chips with pulled pork and those were amazing for an appetizer not to big just the right amount before our burgers came out. No fries with burger but the guy next to us ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and offered us a few because they give you a lot and he was by himself and told us we could have some of his. Those were by far the best French fries I have ever had.       The bar area has about 12 seats across the bar and tables out side of that which has a view of the casino.     I will definitely return to this location on the next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Came here for an early dinner.  Dramatic flames at front facade are failing and the glass is very dirty.   Needs a facelift big time.   Have heard many times that if the outside of a restaurant is dirty, then the inside may follow suit.    Staff and facility appears generally disorganized and tired.  Servers and food handlers seem stressed out.   Table seating is uncomfortable, tabletop was sticky- food and drinks are overpriced.  $20 plus for a burger and no side included.  Mine had a stale bun with it, no-bueno.    Truffle fries had very slight hint of truffle oil.   At least half of the cone had small pieces of over toasted potato crumbles.  The dips provided were tasty.    I checked the chair for cleanliness before I sat down, normally don't need to do that.   Vibe I got from the place was simply off.  Took an hour to get our food after we sat down - that ticked me off.  Server was overwhelmed, not his fault the kitchen wasn't pushing food out timely.  Gordon Ramsay you have too many restaurants now, don't let greed get to you at the  expense of your values and businesses.   It's obvious what is going on here.  Practice what you preach dude - it's not all about the money.   Or is it?  Queuing line to get in is confusing at best.   Lots of foot traffic as this place is at a major Planet Hollywood entrance point.   Music was super loud, cant have a conversation.   Cafeteria style food with Vegas bling sprinkled on it, save your money folks.  Burgers are small for the price.   Our hamburger patty was not made there, previously frozen low grade beef taste.    Major tourist trap you are paying for the name and it's not worth it IMO.   Gordon, you should be crossing your arms with disappointment after reading this review as you know the truth is being spoken here.",

I ordered their Backyard Burger ($15) opted out of cheese and pickles and cooked medium rare. I loved that they had a lettuce wrap option so I went with that as well. Boyfriend got the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($17) and Truffle Fries ($12). Wait was a little longer for food being served, roughly 20 minutes.  Burger patty quality: Fantastic. It tasted so fresh, almost like they had ground the meat themselves in the kitchen. It was fluffy, tender and undeniably juicy as I took that first bite. It was a pretty amazing burger only downside was it definitely ranked on the saltier spectrum of my preference.  They also forgot our Truffle Fries.  That mishap (although they apologized and made sure itbwas taken off our check) and the overly saltiness docked one star for me.",

Well, considering it's Gordon Ramsay and location, it's pretty good.  One downside is, if you got seated next to casino, you may smell cigarette.   The Backyard Burger is very good especially with grilled onion. It is worth the $15 price tag.    Service was good, it took a bit to get burgers but it's fair amount of time due to they had to cook them like regular dishes.",

    "text": "Tip: parties of 5 or more don't have to wait in line, walk up to the hostess stand and they'll text you when your tables about to be ready. We got so lucky with our party of 5 and were able to walk around and shop then go back upstairs to our room at Planet Hollywood to relax. The wait was about 1.5 hours, we sat at 7:30PM.   Price: super reasonable prices especially for the Gordon Ramsey name and it being located on The Strip!   Appetizers came out super quick, took about 2 minutes, it came before our server even gave us our water lol Kettle Chip Nachos: instead of traditional tortilla chips they use kettle cooked potato chips, I feel like this is up to personal preference. I wasn't too crazy about it cause the toppings made the chips soggy but everyone else in my party loved it. They weren't skimp on the meats either.  Beer Battered Onion Rings: super crispy and a good portion to share. Good but nothing too special. Parmesan Truffle Fries: the truffle dipping sauce was really good! Again, good size to share with 2-3 people. This didn't come out until the burgers which I thought was thoughtful of them haha. Cheddar Ale Soup: I wouldn't recommend, it was kind of plain and super super salty.  Took about 15-20 minutes after appetizers for the burgers to come out Our party ended up getting very similar burgers but all the burgers were excellent and cooked perfectly to medium rare, they were also hot temperature wise which I loved, I hate lukewarm food! :)  Hell's Kitchen Burger: LOVED IT! Two of us got this and both reviews were a thumbs up. Super juicy and moist, buns are important to me in a burger and I loved how the bread never got soggy. They weren't skimp with the avocado and there was a spicy kick but nothing too overwhelming. TIP: try adding some of the truffle sauce from the fries on this, heavenly!  Farmhouse Burger: who could go wrong with a fried egg? The mangalitsa bacon really pulled this burger together! I couldn't help but steal a couple bites!   Backyard Burger: a classic burger but nevertheless a good burger!  Can't wait to be back and try some of the more exotic options like the Blue Cheese or Foie Burger, I love foie gras.  Recommend going early cause lines get long, don't go during prime time like lunch or dinner. We walked past at 10:45AM, 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line! The line at dinner was super long but as I've observed, 2 and 3 top tables get turned over pretty quickly.",

The roasted tomatoes and the fries with the chipotle sauce were fantastic. The atmosphere in this resturant made me want to come back weekly. Great for dates or family trips. Highly recommend!

Both burgers came out perfectly cooked and very tasty. Jaime and his assistant, Don kept my Diet Pepsi and my wife's coffee replaced without being ask. That shows me that they pay attention to their customer's needs and aware of their responsibilities. Definitely be back next time visiting Vegas.",

However, we were determined to try the burgers on our last trip to Vegas when the line was just a half hour. The burgers were good but not oh wow great. The fries were those big thick slab type, but I like fresh cut thin fries best. The house made ketchup was decent. We had the onion rings as a starter and enjoyed the rings but not the dipping sauces.  We ordered our burgers medium well. Mine was a mushy medium, but husband's was cooked as ordered. We both think a Coke is a must for the optimum burger experience, but no Cokes here so we got nice, cold beers. The service was slow. The ambience was nothing special. I wouldn't stand in a long line to eat here again. I might eat here again if I were hungry, and there wasn't a line, but otherwise it's a pass. There are better places if you want to indulge in a burger.",

My other friend asked for her burger to be cut after it was already out and presented and the guy who delivered the food said sorry but he could not cut the burger in half because the chefs are \"you know\" and it would ruin the presentation, there were also no knives provided that were good enough to cut the burger. I ordered the ahi tuna sliders and they stuffed the slider too much to eat with my hands. I had to use a fork and it ruined the experience of what a slider is supposed to be. On top of that, they tasted like nothing. The bun was my favourite part of the dish. I will say, our server was excellent. Won't be coming back.",

I ordered Parmesan fries and the Forest Burger and I am not lying when I say this was the absolute best meal I've ever had. The ingredients on the burger were ones I hadn't tried before so didn't prefer, but the patty just melted in your mouth. This gave me clarity on how all the burgers I'd eaten that were leaking grease were just that, but this was actually juicy and completely flavorful along with the perfect combination of the tremor cheese and mushrooms. That order of burger and fries has put everything else I've had to shame, most definitely a meal that will never be lived up to. Go to this restaurant so you can change your life and regret eating any other food forever",

Maybe the chef Ramsey is bs on his tv shows cause this is not acceptable in a place like this. I did not go to MacDonald so I expected better. Fourth,  after I ordered the food I realized I wanted to order coffee (freshly brew coffee) but I could not find my waiter, so I tried to reach other waiters, but they did not care. I was amazed. The other waiters were looking for my waiter. It took me 10 minutes to order the coffee. Amazing. Very poor customer service. Plus the coffee was horrible. I don't know how they can call freshly brew coffee. Burguer tasted good. Not complaint on the burguer. It's pricey but here is Vegas so this acceptable. Finally, I expected better experience because of Chef Ramsey , but now I don't know what to think. Maybe that chef is full of Bs in his TV shows cause definetly bad experience overall here.  Again burguer tasted good...",

It's was a great burger, but it's just a mediocre burger anyone burger restaurant carries. Delicious and satisfying but not finger licking.   My boyfriend got the farm burger (again I think that's what it's called) and just the same as mine. A burger you can get anywhere.   Our friend for the Foie burger (again I think that's what it's called) and he said it's a legit burger. Like the best he's had. I believe him because it was one of the most expensive burger on the menu.   We all got the truffle fries and it was delicious! I love it, but I hope I didn't just love it because I was starving... I did notice it was extremely salty so I couldn't eat a lot.   Overall, it's a great restaurant to try once and say you've eaten here. But the price is a little high and the food just isn't something I'd pay for because I can get the same meal elsewhere but for a cheaper price.",

That anticipation game is just adding up to the hype of eating burger of the famous Gordon Ramsay.

Overrated.   Server: Good looking attentive tattooed chick  Food: I ordered the crown burger and bf ordered the \"hells kitchen\". Mine turned out to be salty and his is supposedly spicy but they must have used fake jalapenos. French fries are ok.   Overall, don't set your standard too high just coz a famous chef owns it!

And here is comes:   It was the BEST SALAD I have ever had in my life.   I'm just gonna repeat myself because I know you're probably in disbelief. I went to Gordon Ramsay Burger and had the best salad of my entire life!   I don't know when I became THAT girl that ordered a salad at the burger joint. I usually judge people who does that shit. It's like going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering fried rice and orange chicken. No! That is not acceptable. (I'm Asian if you can't tell). But I did. I don't know if it's because I'm pregnant and trying to be remotely healthy for this unborn child or because I've been eating shit all week in Vegas, but something inside of me was screaming for the wheatberry salad.   I was actually very hesitant to order it because I saw everyone around me eating burgers. And damn! Those burgers looked and smelled so good. So I thought I'd make the healthier choice and go for the salad. I knew I was gonna regret it.   But to my surprise, it was the best decision I've made in life. It truly was. (Am I dramatic? Maybe! But food is life!) That salad was incredible! The chicken was so flavorful! Not greasy at all! The salad was full of crunch with all sorts of nuts, dried fruits, fresh veggies, and quinoa. It was epic and it was everything I wanted and more. I couldn't have dreamt of a better salad. I had asked for the dressing on the side, and I didn't even poured an ounce of dressing onto my salad! It didn't need it! It was that good!!   The best part of the salad? It was massive! It can probably feed 3 people. Or one pregnant girl! Ha! I ate the entire thing myself even though I was so full half way through it. But I was determined not to let that deliciousness go to waste! Trust me on this- order the wheatberry quinoa salad!! You won't regret it. Your body will thank you.   I had a bite of my friend's turkey burger and truffle fries. It was pretty darn good. I won't lie! Truffle fries are pretty greasy though. You can tell it came straight from the deep fryer and you can see the oil dripping down as you dive in for your first bite. If that's your type of thing, then go for me. For me, it was too greasy.   I will definitely come back here! It makes me sad that we don't have this joint in SF. The restaurant is great- very modern and clean. Servers are attention and friendly. Prices are reasonable for the strip. And overall, it's just delicious! I don't know and I don't care who Gordon Ramsay is but man, he sure knows how to make an unforgettable salad!",

Get the sweet potato fries. I didn't want them and ended up eating SO many. The other fries are thicker steak fries, which isn't my thing, but the others enjoyed them. But really, powdered sugar and sweet fries- it's love. Fries ought to come with the burgers, so idiots like us don't order them first and fill up on potatoes. My burger was the forest burger, but everyone got something different and we all came to the same conclusion- best burger ever. The meat is light and juicy, not greasy. The buns were really soft and fluffy. Also, sometimes in Vegas I receive spectacularly poor service since everything is so busy, but not here. The server was very busy, but when he was at our table he was engaged with us- he wasn't looking around, distracted and rushed. Will absolutely wait around another hour and a half next time I'm in Vegas.",

I went to talk to them about why it was moving slower than we were told and why other parties were walking in (when there were no reservations available). I was told these were diamond players and they took priority. This would've been good info to have before we wasted 45-mins in line. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else.

    "text": "Luckily we arrived early enough on a Sunday afternoon to by pass the long line to get in to this place.  Staff was inviting, knowledgeable and friendly.  Refills came quick and upon ordering we were quickly informed we may be interested in a starter because all burgers take about 30 mins to be prepared and delivered to table. We decided on chicken wings and beer battered onion rings.  Was super excited. Expecting to be blown away, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.  The rings were made with shoe string thin onions, a lot of oil and light batter.  I literally felt like I had a cup of grease in my mouth   The wings were very meaty, but just seemed dry to me...but honestly I'm not a great wing eater, so according to husband, these were \"pretty good.\"  Burgers--Hell's Kitchen burger, the chiles add a dimension of smokiness and full round flavor.   The Hog Burger, super huge and filling.  Very delish! Forest Burger, my burger:  bacon fried in duck fat, patty, sauteed mushrooms, arugula and I added an egg.  Thank goodness gracious I added that egg--it added some creaminess and moisture to the burger (even though I ordered med-rare, not very juicy) that it needed desperately.  I don't know if someone over seasoned the sauteed mushrooms and put too much salt, or if the thick cut duck fat bacon lent a salty taste to the burger, but darn it, my blood pressure went up!  I had to pull out the bacon  And I absolutely love--LOVE arugula on a burger, but the heaviness, and maybe the creaminess of the egg in combo with the arugula just didn't work.  The arugula lent a bitter, earthly zing to the burger, and not in a good way  gosh, I'm so bummed.  First time at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and not super impressed...",

    "text": "The restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel off of the Vegas strip. The restaurant is fairly easy to find since it is not fully enclosed. The exterior is decorated with a cool window displaying a fire design.   The menu is built around gourmet burgers. I ordered the Forest burger and Parmesan truffle fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well with the Parmesan and truffle oil. It is enough for two to share as a side. The burger marinated well with the combination of mushrooms and tremor cheese. J was skeptical of trying the duck bacon since I am not a huge fan of bacon in general, but it complimented the burger itself, which was a thick patty. It was also topped with arugula and the sesame seed bun was toasted to a perfection and not too thick as to take away from the toppings.  I would definitely return to try one of the other burger options. The price point is decent considering it is a well crafted burger that will make you full. The menu offers a handful of burgers, but unfortunately you cannot substitute other toppings free of charge.",

Once we were seated, we were almost immediately greeted by our server.  I can't remember his name, but he was GREAT!  He made an excellent suggestion about a secret burger (the F Word burger), that my husband ended up ordering.  It was a little pricey, but well worth it.  I had the Farmhouse burger, and then we shared the truffle fries.  So so good!!!  I must also add that this was not our 1st visit here, but probably the best food and service that we have ever received.

I'd pass on the Tandoori Chicken Burger, though -- it's good, but nothing special.  The truffle fries with dipping sauces were delicious and big enough for two to share.

Never really considered a bun to be a really essential part of the burger but this bun is special .   Skip the $12 garlic fries. Good but Not worth it .",

I understand Vegas isn't cheap but for what Burger is, it's a little expensive for how terrible the service is. After eating here twice, idk that we'll come back.  Explanation of bad service - The waitress we had was not a native English speaker and was very very difficult to understand. She also could not answer questions about the menu and told us she needed someone else to help. It slowed the whole meal down significantly. Once we had ordered she brought the food out, and it was not as it was explained on the menu, or by her, or by the server who helped explain it. Idk if it was a language barrier/miscommunication issue but I would like to be able to expect that I get what I ordered and not something else.",

I'm not the biggest burger fan, but the patty was thick and juicy at medium-doneness without turning the bun into a hemoglobin sponge. I got the forester which has truffled goat cheese and duck bacon. There was plenty of truffle flavor, but the duck bacon wasn't anything memorable. It wasn't the best burger I've had, but it was still top notch.  My favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. The kettle chip nachos taste like an upgraded version of something you might find at the Tilted Kilt. They were good, but the hell fire wings were better. They're cut so that they're easier to eat, and they're fried perfectly so that the skin is crispy while leaving the meat moist. The buffalo sauce is not too hot and slightly sweet, but it's more like a glaze such that it doesn't ruin the crispy texture. Finally, they're topped with some blue cheese. I loved them. Still, my favorite dish was the truffle fries, and that's solely because of the truffle aoli. The truffle scent from the aoli dominates the atmosphere no matter what else you have on your table. It looks thick and heavy, but it instantly melts into a rich cloud of truffle flavor once it's in your mouth. I could've stuck my straw in the sauce cup.  Finally, that oreo creme brulee shake is great if you like rich desserts. The creme brulee pudding layer is very sweet and heavy, and the oreo milk shake layer is runny with no iciness. Getting a little bit of both in each sip is key.  While Gordon's was great, I don't feel right giving it 5 stars when comparing it to other world class burger joints. For example, I still think Chicago's Au Cheval has a much better burger. Still, it's worth a visit if you're in the area.",

It was a 45 minute wait for a table of 10, and another 15-20 minutes for the actual burger.   We ordered the truffle fries. I don't agree with some of the reviews here, about the truffle fries being amazing. I've definitely had better. The fries were thick cut and not crispy, and the sauce that accompanied it was just okay. Gordon Ramsay Burger has their own homemade ketchup which none of us was a fan of. The onion rings were slightly better than the fries but again, I've definitely had better. For my entree, I've had one of their \"secret\" burgers which consisted of NY Strip and Ribeye and cost $22. The meat itself was amazing - very juicy and tender, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had the Forest burger. He did not like it at all and only had a couple of bites. He thought it was dry. My friend had the hotdog, which he thought was good.   Service was great and the restaurant itself was beautifully renovated. I'd probably go back to Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips and Gordon Ramsay Steak and skip this one.",

I had the hell's kitchen burger. To preface, I do have a fairly high spice tolerance so the burger to me was just heated, nothing to freak out about, even though the server warned me I might want to have the ghost pepper cheese on the side. That being said, the burger was delicious, tasty, juicy, and held up to the last bite. We also tried the salmon toast, pesto mac and cheese and the hummus. All tasty.   The service was great. Our server, Heather, was extremely friendly, kind and helpful. She did the most to accommodate our family and made us feel very welcome, from menu recommendations to accommodations for our picky eater.   Would recommend. Great atmosphere and decorations.",

It was around 11pm but the place was crowded!  However, a table for 2 usually doesn't take too long.  We started off with a portion of their fries. Delicious!!! Thick slices just like I love. They came with some dipping sauces and one of them was truffle aioli, which was so good! I ordered the Forest burger. I had never had duck bacon before and loved it! This burger was very very good. The bun was toasted so didn't get soggy throughout the meal.  The other guest had the Blue burger. I tried a piece of it and it was good too. For cheese lovers it is a must! It is VERY cheesy.  We decided we needed more fries so we ordered the sweet potato fries. They are served in very thin slices with some powdered sugar on top. I really liked them, it is a different twist. But their \"simple\" fries were my favorite!",

Food-wise, the Hell's Kitchen burger definitely lives up to the name. I usually get the wheat bun along with a patty done medium well. The burger comes with huge pieces of avocado and jalapeno aioli, which comes as a surprising (but tasty) kick. Everything was cooked to perfection and the burger itself just effortlessly melts in your mouth. However, I'm not a huge fan of their fries. Think thick-cut steak fries on the soggier side with no seasoning at all. Not even a pinch of salt or pepper - lacking some love, I'd say. Plus the curry ketchup was very much an acquired taste. The flavors just didn't mix well at all in my opinion. Skip the fries, but the Hell's Kitchen burger is a must.",

The wait is not really bad, and if it is long, it is very much worth it. The staff are extremely friendly, and it pretty much has the best service of any other restaurant that I have been to. The food here is very filling. In my opinion, the best burger is the Farmhouse Burger. I just like how the meat, bacon, egg, and cheese compliment each other very well and create one truly memorable experience. The parmesan truffle fries are absolutely to die for. The creme brulee shake would make you think twice about purchasing a Frappuccino, In N Out shake, and even a Five Guys shake. One may think that the prices here are expensive, but I would be just as full if I ate at The Wicked Spoon and Wynn Buffets for half the price and a quarter of the food. I would rate the food a 5/5 and the service a 5/5. This undeniably deserves my second 5 Star rating. Oh... and make sure when you find a parking be close because it would be a pain for you to walk through Miracle Mile Shops after you eat here!",

    "text": "Over priced, over hyped, mediocre burgers.  The wait to sit is long. The wait to get your food is even longer. Burgers are around $15 and up. Fries are not included and they will run you $8, $11 if you want truffle fries.   The burger patties are DRY. I wanted to try a specialty burger so I went with the Hog Burger ($18) and BF went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15). Both of the patties were dry. We also got the truffle fries ($11) and they were steak fries which I am not a fan of. Also, they came out lukewarm. Now, I have no problem with the price if the burgers are good. I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so I understand the high prices. But if I'm paying for those prices, I expect it to be good. I've had super premium dry age beef burgers upwards to $26 to greasy spoon burgers, and I love them all as long as they are good. I rather eat In-N-Out, Shake Shack, even Five Guys that I don't like that much over Gordon Ramsay Burger. Even if they are the same price.   The service is a whole 'nother thing. We waited close to an hour for the burgers to come out. The server explain that it takes them 45 minutes to an hour to cook the burgers. At least they could have given us the fries beforehand? And how come some people got their stuff quicker than us? We were highly suspicious they dropped our order or something went wrong in the back. Around 30 minute mark, we asked about our order and they said our burgers were next. Another 15 minute and no burgers. 50 minutes ish, the burgers come out and a bit later the manager comes over to apologize and explain, but there isn't much of an explanation. He says he'll get us a free beer or a shake but I know I'm gonna be way too full for that. I'd rather he comped the mediocre fries or something but oh well.  In the end, the bill was over $60 for two burgers, fries, and a beer. And a highly regrettable choice of meal for our short time in Vegas.",

With so many good reviews and being the burger lover that I am this place was on our list for Vegas Dinning. Being as we got here early we didnt wait too long to be seated. maybe 20 mins for a party of two. We sat ordered and our burger came about 30 minutes later. Sure this is a long time to wait for a burger but it was worth it. We both ordered the Hells kitchen  burger and my partner added a fried egg which he really enjoyed. Over all good experience only wish they offered regular ketchup as im not a huge fan of homemade ketchup concoctions. Try it, but dont come when your already starving.  Burger average 15.00 Fries 11.00",

I'm not sure they seasoned their patties or not but the buns were good. We ordered chicken wing, 2 burgers, and truffle fries. Our total came out to be $70. Wouldn't come back again. Recommend going to other burger joint or go to Gordon's steakhouse over Gordon's burger. Portions were a good size because we had appetizers the burgers filled us up. We did not finish our truffle fries.",

    "text": "I came across this restaurant as I was exploring Planet Hollywood, and of course me being a big burger snob, so I decided to check this place out. I found the exterior super exciting and cool looking. The wait was max 10 minutes.   Once we walked in and were seated, I was quite impress on how fast that was, however when I saw how big the restaurant was, my expectations of the quality of the food decreased. Thank goodness the ending was not a disappointment.  Being a huge burger snob of course I asked the extremely kind gentleman that assisted us for his recommendations. He gladly recommended a seasonal burger that was off menu. He provided the details of the ingredients and I was convinced so I ordered it ( forgot the name but it was beef with short rib, it was amazing!!!). I also ordered the fries that came along with a curry & chipotle ketchup. Me not being a fan of curry, chipotle nor ketchup, the thought didn't fancy my interest so in addition to what was already in front of me I still went ahead requested for regular ketchup. I ended up wanting to get the full experience of their touch to the fries so I went ahead and tasted both the curry and chipotle ketchup resulted in making my taste buds tingle and I ended up not being able to stop dipping my fries in the curry... wowsers..  Let's cut this long story to a conclusion...  The burger exceeded my expectations.. Yes, it did!! Would I try this place again.. Yes, I would definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas!!  Excellent Service and even though we were warned that we would wait a little while for our food, the wait was not as bad as we thought.   From a Beer Snobs point of view, the only downfall was that they don't have quite a large variety in Craft Beer and they don't support any of their local breweries... boo!!!! But the 1 DIPA available that I tried was a comfort to my beer & burger snob ways...",

I personally hate blue cheese but this burger had a great balance of flavors w the figgy jam, super juicy and various depths of flavors, I just cant explain- its a must try. The burnt ends poutine were bomb and the onion rings had a light crisp and tasted kinda like a funnel cake but better, they were sooo good you didn't need ketchup or ranch. Basically I will be reordering the same thing next week when Im back in Vegas. :)",

The girl returned w my order all ready. To my disappointment it looked like it was sitting there a while and the burgers were not hot.   We had the Hog and it was well made. Pink in the inside and favors well balanced. I also had one w curry spice. Wasn't what I expected but it was still good. No sides w order. Spent almost $40 for 2 burgers n tips. Great to try but I won't do it again. It's not bad but also not that that great.",

Everybody's plates and that which we ordered were all spectacular. This is a must try you are into gourmet burgers.   All of the burger should attempt to come close to the quality and taste of Gordon Ramsey's burgers.   If you are looking for the same for the french fries don't hold any hope because the French fries were actually disgusting. If you want fantastic french fries go to Bobby's Burger Palace. The burgers are good there too but the french fries are fantastic!  Grab your burger at Gordon Ramsay's and head  over to Bobby's Burger Palace for the fries on you are in for a fantastic meal.

While it may seem pricey for just a burger, you'll leave full and happy wondering how any burger could ever compare.   If you have any room for desert the chocolate tart was amazing! It had the smoothness of chocolate, with a slight texture of caramel. The way it melted in your mouth makes it worth it. While I'm going to have to run for days to burn off the calories from this meal, I would absolutely do it again.",

    "text": "Thanks to the Total Rewards Diamond card, we were able to skip the *gulp* 2-hour wait that was quoted to another curious customer. In fact, our wait was 5 minutes max, which was great. The parmesan truffle fries were in fact kick-ass, and the Caesar salad with chicken was pretty nice (I liked the little fancy touches of 2-3 other greens besides the iceberg lettuce) and amazingly enough, adding chicken on was ONLY $1. Say what? This was two skewers of chicken freshly grilled. Usually chicken is $3 or more as a salad add-on, so I was impressed, skewer or no skewer.   The downside is, of course, the wait on the burger. Like don't come hungry, cause you will be left hungry for a-whi-le. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, but it was more in the 45 plus range. More accurately, an hour plus but we had appetizers so it didn't feel that bad. The couple next to us only ordered burgers though; it got to the point where they complained, and their burgers were delivered first with a free appetizer, so maybe it worked out?   As for our burger, we got the mushroom to split. They are able to cut some burgers in half, but ours had bacon, so it was no-go. By then, I had filled up on fries, water, salad, and wait-time, so I took two bites, one for the experience, one for good measure and gave up on the rest. It was good, but nothing I would care to order again.",

My wife and I are advit Gordon Ramsay TV program viewers so when we saw his burger restaurant at Planet Hollywood we thought what a great opportunity to have the Ramsay experience. We were not expecting to see Ramsay himself but to eat from his menu.   The wait can be incredible if you have a party of three or more. That night when we dine, the wait was quoted at 60 to 75 minutes. There were groups that waited it out. They wanted the Ramsay experience so they paid with their time.   The menu offers a variety of burgers with pricey stickers. The sides are good yet pricey as well. Our total bill for two was over $65. That's two burgers, onion rings and fries. No beverages just water (which is free).   The food is good but not worth the cost. You pay for the Ramsay experience.",

I had never tried duck bacon before and I loved it. They also have gluten free fries. The menu is very clear about what is gluten free and what is not. I did not have a reaction and I am not gluten free by choice.   If I didn't have to eat gluten free I still would have ordered the forest burger on a glorious gluten filled bun. Either way the burger was delicious. The service is slow but it's Vegas and the restaurant was full. The line does move quickly. I recommend the restaurant.",

    "text": "We stopped here before the rush however it was still busy since being in the casino. My husband wanted to try since well it's Gordon Ramsey. We got sat at the chef's counter. I thought maybe the chef would actually talk to us like he did to some of the other customers sitting down from us but he didn't. Maybe he was afraid we didn't speak English? In any case our servers were pleasant. I'm assuming they share tips since we had multiple ppl serve us. We ordered the hells kitchen burger and forest burger. My husband said the hells kitchen burger tasted like a normal burger with some spice to it. Mine was made of lamb, which i don't recall reading in the menu but maybe I missed it. It also had duck bacon, arugula ( which is the latest big fad to add to a sandwich) and some cheese and mushrooms that i don't remember the spelling of. Since I expected beef and turned out to be lamb it was obviously a surprise. Overall the burger was good but nothing like I would jump on the chair like Tom Cruise on Oprah Winfrey show or anything.  We also had the parmesan truffle fries which literally were french fries sprinkled with fresh parsley and shredded parmesan cheese. There was nothing truffle about it.  Since we were sitting right where the cooks work I literally saw the fries get fried, dumped in a cone, and then a waitress dashed some parsley on them and took a clump of cheese to throw on top and then they served it to us. Not sure what the sauces were as no one explained them and everyone was too busy to ask. Definitely not ketchup or mustard. I would say the red sauce was like a pizza sauce and the mustard was lije a mustard mayo butter mix. Overall it was a good experience and just to say we went to a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, but wouldn't eat here twice.",

Although I was completely wrong about all my expectations. The wait was long about 1hr long wait for a table for four. The customer service was okay, it wasn't above average. My wife and I had already ate but the kids where hungry so we got them some grilled cheeses and we ordered the blue cheese burger with the truffle oil fries. And about three drinks at the end of the day we spent a whopping $70. The grilled cheeses were nothing impressive and the burger was so so, not what I would expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The flavor combination was overpowering, too salty the bun was swamped with butter or an oil. The fries were ok they were not crispy but super chewy like bubble gum, it was like trying to bite off the cartilage of a chicken leg bone. Would I come back? Neh, for sure would go somewhere else next time.",

I am a annual visitor in Las Vegas and i always stop here regardless.       The only con is the looooooooong wait for a table.",

    "text": "Hands down, best burger.  This review is a few months late but wanted to put this here since I just did one for the Fish & Chips joint and didn't feel the same way there.  The fact that I am still craving the Hell's Kitchen burger after few months proves that it was memorable.  The patty was juicy and not heavily seasoned.  I could taste the natural flavor of the beef and each ingredient inside the burger added a different layer and dimension to the bite.  The whole burger felt thoughtful and made complete sense.  I've never felt that way about a burger before so that was a first.  I should've ditched Fish & Chips and went back here last vegas visit.    Truffle fries were superb.  I am picky about my truffle fries.  Sometimes they can feel like when you're trapped in an elevator with someone with way too much perfume.  Not this one.",

    "text": "Good once. Maybe their shake will bring me back for a second try.  $50 for a burger, fries, and shake...and quite a long wait.  I stood in line for about 1/2 an hour just before 3pm on a Saturday, which was understandable. After being seated at the bar, the server took my order within a few minutes.  I ordered the Hog Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and a Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake.  The shake came out within 5 or 10 minutes, followed shortly by the fries.  However, it was somewhere between 35 to 40 minutes before my burger came out. The server had warned of a 25-30 minute wait, and I had accepted that. However, by then, the fries were lukewarm, and my shake had been devoured as it was absolutely delicious.  The overwhelming memory of the Hog Burger was its dryness. The generous serving of patty was cooked to a perfect medium as suggested by the server, but I found myself requiring a lot of water to offset the dryness of the entire burger.  On one hand, this was a nice change to the usual grease-drenched burgers at other establishments, but perhaps a light spread would make the burger more enjoyable.   The Truffle Parmesan fries were just ok. There was a light sprinkle of parmesan over the top of the fries, which lead to a rather uneven distribution of the cheese once you got to the fries hiding at the bottom, especially since they were served in a cone.  There were two interesting sauces; one was red and mildly spicy(chipotle ketchup) and the other was a yellow creamy blend(truffle aioli).  One of the barbacks/assistants made my service experience excellent. He filled in for my server and refilled water regularly and noticed that I was scrutinizing my prestained fork and offered to replace it without my having to ask.   Overall, not a satisfying first experience with their burger and fries, but I've only sampled a small portion of their menu.",

After all, it was the \"best\" in Nevada supposedly.   We showed up relatively late, maybe around 930 and there was no wait. We ordered a Hellfire Chicken Salad and a Hell's Kitchen Burger. Both were really mediocre. The salad was some lettuce, a skewer, and a few other miscellaneous items. The burger was small and meh. Both not worth the price.   The best part of the meal was dessert. We had the sticky toffee pudding ice cream sandwich and that was absolutely delicious. The burger though, definitely not the best. I actually would've enjoyed an In-N-Out burger more. Gasp!",

The truffle fries are really good with the various sauces, and the brittania burger with mango chutney is small but also provides a mix between hot and sweet taste.

    "text": "Good but beware, the lines can get ridiculously long. That's why you gotta get your Seven Stars or Platinum buddy to come to the rescue. It just cuts everyone in line like a hot knife over butter.  -- Got to try 4 burgers and 3 fries --  Let's start with the BEST, the burgers:  1) Forest Burger $17 - AMAZING. Wow, the juicy tender incredibly flavorful patty with even more flavor from the tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula (dressed, no naked ingredients here!) and duck bacon. I just wished my stomach could handle more but the sides we got were killers [I would not order 3 sides of fries for 4 people]  2) Farmhouse Burger $17 - This was great. All protein and not a sight of plant here. I think the fat afrom the mangalitsa bacon does the trick here, a shiny burger doused in liquid lard.   3) \"Foie\" Burger $22 - My friend got this and she didn't love it. I thought it was okay as I am not a fan of foie anymore. I think it was just too heavy in all aspect, fat, foie, cheese... I personally think burgers should have some vegetables to balance the heaviness. The last two did not.   4) There was also a Lobster and shrimp burger but it isn't on the menu anymore. It was good and lightish but here, you gotta get the beef.   Then there were the sides which really felt like the main courses too (not my favorite and next time, I would skip these altogether)  1) Beer Battered Onion Rings $9. Good but honestly, too much in terms of dough and the salty parmigiano-reggiano as they were very generous with it. The additives make these heavier than your usual rings. Plan accordingly because we did NOT finish any of the fries and we are not slim people.  2) Truffle Parmesan Fries $12. There were aromatic as expected. Thick cut, loads of potato action here. Possibly a tad dry and a little too hard for my liking.   3) Sweet potato fries. Disappointing because they were limp and not hot. They were clearly not freshly fried. I think they were SO busy that night that the quality of the food kinda dropped.   We asked them to bring us freshly fried ones but the next batch was simply hotter and a little darker but did not feel fresh. We left them. Service was slow, it was a busy night.",

Like an hr... We went around the casino and table was ready.. We ordered the fries, the hells burger, blue cheese and Mediterranean.. All with veggie patties. The fries was good plus they gave us a whole array of sauces that made it fun  The burgers arrived.. A good portion size... One bite into the blue cheese, I was blown away!! The patty was one of the best patties I have ever had and the blue cheese had a unique flavor profile that was sharp and delicious  They said the hells was spicy, it was ok, nothing to race about, the tandoori paste in the Mediterranean was pretty good but my heart belongs to the blue cheese burger  The reason I am taking a star off is that they charge 6$ more for a veggie as opposed to a meat patty and I am unable to justify it.. The patty is real good but that costing more than meat, I don't know",

I've finally got a chance to try it. Typical wait but much shorter(about 20 minutes). When we were finally greeted by the host and brought inside It was empty! There were at least 10 tables that were open so I don't understand what the wait was about. When we finally sat down the waitress took forever to come take our order. When she finally did we ordered a 'Hells kitchen burger' and truffle fries. The burger took awhile to come and when it did it was the wrong burger! They gave us the ultimate cheese burger! When we told her it was the wrong burger she didn't ask if we wanted a new one made she took another 10 minutes to go get the rest of the toppings and came back with a plate of it. She gave us a small plate with roasted tomatoes, avocado, and a cup of aioli sauce as if she was saying 'here make ya own damn burger.'  The burger was very mediocre. It was too dry for my taste. I expected a juicy burger filled with flavor. For someone who made a living off of criticizing other people's restaurants maybe Ramsay needs to check into his own.",

    "text": "Came here with a huge group of 15 people and I wanna say everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I got the Hog Burger which is $18 (on the higher end for a burger in my opinion), but it's one of their specialties, I was hungry, and I'm rarely in Vegas so I thought \"Why not?\"  The group also ordered truffle fries and onion rings for each table. Lemme just say - these were some of the best fries and onion rings I've ever had. The breading on them was generous but also light and crisp. I love my fries to still taste like the potato and these fries were perfectly tater-y. I've never thought onion rings were anything special, but Gordon Ramsay takes them to another level. These also came with some kind of aoli and ketchup, both of which were SO GOOD with the fries and rings. You have to order these if you go!   My burger came and it was big. At first I thought, I could finish this pretty easily because I'm starving. Halfway into the burger, I began to struggle. The Hog Burger has THREE kinds of pork - the patty, bacon, and pulled pork. The only veggies on there were some cole slaw and maybe a pickle LOL. Because I love my veggies, I kind of regretted ordering the Hog because I felt so greasy and bloated afterwards, but it was still delicious! Probably one of the tastiest burgers I've tried and the patty was HUGE.   The server accommodated our huge group well and everyone seemed to be satisfied with their food. Would love to come and try another one of their burgers sometime! And obviously order the fries and rings. Never forget.",

If you want a beer, try Gordon's favorite - Innus & Gunn on tap.  Very crisp and clean with no bitterness.  We make this a must visit place on every trip to Vegas.",

I remember this marshmallow dipping sauce and it was amazing.   the 2nd time i got the jalapeno poppers (not on the menu anymore), burger and my date got a hot dog, we both left so satisfied and excited.   this last time the menu has been changed, they dont have a lot of things they had before which is kind of sad. I loved the jalapeno poppers and they are gone. I enjoyed the hot dogs and there are only 2 now.   I ordered the anniversary burger which was nice and the meat was flavorful, they only had a veggie option that was mushroom and my friend is allergic to port mushrooms.   Everything was good but just lacked that something special the 1st 2 times provided us.   This  last time was for my birthday and it was very nice but I wish i would have stopped after the 1st or 2nd time because the 3rd time was a bit of a let down. I will be back again hope they bring back some of the things i enjoyed before.",

We so got a couple of cocktails.. The rum punch, bad donkey and another fruity cocktail. The cocktails were a bit disappointing though (definitely needs improvement).   All in all, it was a good experience and would definitely be back for the burgers and fries. Be prepared for the wait though. We had to wait almost an hour for a table for two.",

And each time I go I feel like it would be easier to find Narnia as there is little in the way of directions or maps to find the place.      Once you get to the door you are greeted with a wall of flames and a line that at times could be long. Lucky for us our wait was only about 10 to 15 minutes.     The restaurant has a nice atmosphere but is busy and feels a little cramped. On the menu your choices are mostly different forms of a burger. And my fat kid mentality wanted to try them all. My wife and I settled for the hot wings, the Hog Burger, the Fois Burger and some truffle fries.     The wings were some of the best wings I have had in my life. And the way they prepared the bone made it much easier to get access to all of the delectable meat. The Fois Burger was amazingly rich and delicious. I thought I was eating Unicorn meats. And oh my the bites I had of the Hog Burger were amazing. It was a pork and bacon lovers wet dream of all dreams. I'm getting excited thinking of it now. The only part of the meal not exciting was the the truffle fries. They were not much more than frozen fries you get at the grocery store with some Parmesan. And I was not a fan of the homemade ketchup.      Overall, I completely recommend and can it wait to try some of the other burgers one day",

The burger however was a major disappoint! All I could taste was the avocado. It took over the entire taste of the burger. The bun was soft and delicious but everything else inside was not. The patty was cooked just how I liked it , but I couldn't enjoy it because of the dominant avocado taste.  Came out disappointment as the place wasn't anything special",

We stared with the blue cheese wings as the appetizer. I was a little skeptic since I usually don't like blue cheese ANYTHING! but I was starving and I wanted wings! I gotta say I was very pleased with the combination of flavor! Really amazing wings! We then order the hell kitchen burger and the farmhouse burger and a order of fries.  Was given the wrong order at first before it was corrected. Luckily I hadn't even touch the plate since I was taking the picture for this review lol Maybe my expectations where a little too high considering the name on the restaurant, maybe I just watch his shows too much idk lol But I gotta say I was not impress with the burgers. They where good, but that's it, just good, nothing out of this world.  Fries where totally flavorless, side of ranch was lacking flavor as well. My advice would be to go when you have time to spare, don't order the fries not worth the 12$ instead order extra wings! Lol  The wings is the only reason I was satisfied. If I would have just order the wings n left I would probably have given this place 5stars . Customer service was ok at best.",

I was a little nervous from all the recent reviews and to be honest; good or bad reviews, I had to try it. I loooove Gordon Ramsay!!!  The service was great and the food was SO GOOOOOOOD!! WOW!!!!!  I definitely recommend starting off with Burnt Ends Poutine...ugh!!! TO DIE FOR!!! It's basically fries with burnt ends, cheddar cheese curds and pickled onions....smothered in this black pepper gravy.....YUM YUM YUM!!! I felt like I was eating something off the food network. Very different and delicious at the same time. WOW!  BURGERS: Personally, I don't think you can go wrong with any burger. My husband ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger and I ordered the Farmhouse Burger. Both burgers were cooked medium and they were both flavorful, juicy and super DELICIOUS!!   Overall, great experience. From the food to the service! If you're in vegas, you must try!",

Rich and succulent are all words to describe the Foie Gras Burger at Gordon Ramsay's. \"Worth\" would not be a word to describe it because at $22, the burger is about 4 inches in diameter. The flavor was almost there, but to me it was simply not enough to justify the price. The chevre goat cheese on the burger was delightfully creamy and a little bit tangy, which went nicely with the frisee salad on top. They recommend medium cook for their burgers but I always prefer medium rare. The patty itself didn't seem to have too much flavor and the toppings definitely outshined the burger.   The truffle Parmesan fries are great, thick-cut like steak fries or like \"chips.\" The truffle aioli that it was served with was so fragrant, I almost prefer the fries over the burger.   Milk shakes looked yummy. My friends enjoyed the Creme Brulee Shake and the Brown Butter Caramel Pecan Shake.   Blue Moon Mango Beer was sweet and refreshing.   Great service and wait for two large tables of 8 was about an hour or so during dinner. I showed up to put my name down and they texted me when my tables were ready.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay Burger is a full service upscale burger restaurant located in Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas Strip. I had the most amazing chicken tandoori burger here a while back that has been discontinued. My husband had two very positive experiences here but this time differed some.   This time I tried the Fish & Crisps Burger.  I received a generously sized thinly beer battered piece of cod on a fluffy toasted sesame bun. It was fried nicely and came to me drowning in yuzu mayo (like a 1/4 cup) and it was piled with a lot of salt and vinegar crisps. It was easy to remove the extra dressing and some crisps so that isn't a big deal but this sandwich had almost no flavor to it. I enjoyed the fish and chips from another Gordon Ramsay Restaurant here so I thought I'd enjoy this sandwich. I couldn't complain or send it back because there was really nothing wrong (except too much dressing) but I really didn't enjoy it. I don't know if it was made right or not. It was also maybe too heavy and rich for me. I ate it open face with a knife and fork. It tasted better to me when I scraped off all the dressing and used the curry ketchup from the fries. ($17.00)  We were both slightly bummed about the fries. The good was that they came out hot and stayed hot during our stay. But the good fries were on the top and under them was a pile of little ends of fries that were all slightly over cooked. I liked both dipping sauces (curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup) that came with the fries. ($8.00)  My husband tried the Hog Burger this time (mangalitsa pork, bacon, bbq pork, cheddar, pickles, crisp onion and slaw) The bacon from this burger was juicy and very good. The pork patty was thick pink dense and dry.....it was very odd and was topped with dry bbq pork. My husband kept eating it and I asked how it was. He said he didn't know how this sandwich should be. The waiter does come by and ask how things were. I didn't feel like complaining about the fries......and I just thought I just didn't like the fish sandwich so I said OK. My husband had a mouth full at the time so he didn't say anything. Latter he did show me a big piece of the pork patty and I did feel it and it was dry and very dense......At the end of our stay he did ask the waiter what the pork was suppose to be like and the waiter said moist and juicy. He did say that you should have said something when I asked. I do agree my husband should have said something but he also didn't know what the pork patty should be like.  I know most restaurants have hot and cold days but I prefer to hit them on hot days.",

    "text": "Valentine's day (late) dinner at the (in)famous Gordon Ramsay Burger place. We came here around 11pm after we watched a hockey game at the T-Mobile Arena.  We were in line for 5 min until we were told we could seat at the bar, we refused and said we prefer a table, 2 min later, they give us a better option, the chef's counter.   For drinks, they had a Valentine's special, for (as low as) $24 you could get 2 shots (coffee cream and tequila), 2 chocolate coated strawberries and 2 shot glasses as a gift and yea... we took that. As weird as tequila and coffee cream sounds, it was very good! Although the souvenir glasses were 2 regular glasses with (I kid you not) a sticker on top, which we thought was incredibly lame.   We ordered the Hog (no onions), the Hells Kitchen Burger and the parmesan fries to share. It took more than 30 min for our food to be ready, but we believe it was worth the wait. The Hells Kitchen was very very spicy but very flavorful, the Hog was a delight as well, no wonder it was marked as a special, it was incredible. The fries come with an amazing truffle sauce!  Overall good experience, pricy for a burger place (dropped $100) but the food was very good.",

Once we were seated the service was good, just a tad bit slow because of how busy it was. Not gonna lie, I was a bit hungover from the night before which made time move even slower and it felt like a lifetime before we got our food. However, when the food finally came out it looked and tasted amazing! Exactly what I needed after a night out. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries. The meat was cooked perfectly and the burger was pretty juicy. I love spicy food, so I didn't think the roasted jalapenos made the burger too spicy. The fries were crispy, delicious and came with ketchup as well as a tasty truffle aoili. It was the perfect size to share between 3 people. I would definitely come back during my next visit to Vegas to try out some more burgers and all the desserts!",

Everything was cold!  I ordered the Hog Dawg with the pulled pork on the side and it was brought to me with pork still on the dog. When I mentioned it to my waiter he attempted to say it was something else, my boyfriend straight up took a bit and said it's pulled pork. He was kind enough to get me a new one. But as I said things were so cold. Why?  And my boyfriend and I both had stomach aches, he ended up throwing up in the hotel later that day. Neither of us drink.",

I went with my girlfriend and we got the classic ramsey burger, stout burger, truffle fries, and oreo creme bule shake. The classic burger is delicious and refreshing. The stout burger is hands down the best burger I have ever eaten. The mushrooms and onions with the juicy patty goes so well together. The burgers go very well with their house aioli sauce. That sauce is so good. Don't even get me started on the shake. They put creme bule in a milkshake. Who tf does that? But that shake hit differently. To be honest I teared up a few times eating here cuz the food was so good. Definitely would recommend going here if u in vegas area. It also doesn't hurt ur wallet that bad.

Celebrity and hype aside, the food is friggin' delicious! FRIGGIN' DELICIOUS! I had the Turducken burger and nearly lost my mind, the hubs ordered the Bleu Cheese and arugula burger (can't remember the official name of his), but when we halved our burgers and swapped, I literally lost it! Juicy burgers, melt in your mouth toasted buns, perfect condiment to burger ratios-- SO GOOD!   Then there were the truffle fries! Not greasy, truffle-y, and simply perfect. The accompanying ketchup and aioli was delicious. Side note: That's not your average ketchup at GR Burger. I don't know what it is (and I'd like to), but I wanted to bathe in it. (Seriously, how the heck do you slay ketchup??? Never imagined it to be possible.)  And finally, because we were on a high and couldn't leave  well enough alone, we ordered the butter pecan shake and I lost it--yep, again! The shake is the bomb, the candied pecans, and that ice cream-- good Lord.   GR is more than celebrity hype (and I'm so glad). His food and service (our tatted up, blondie server with the ear gauge holes was absolutely awesome-- didn't catch or need her name because she was always there and amazingly detail oriented, with great suggestions) is perfection and I don't think I'll ever be the same! How the heck am I supposed to survive when I go home after eating 4 (count 'em) Gordon Ramsay meals?",

    "text": "Me and T finally made our way here during our last Vegas trip to try out CHEF GORDON RAMSAY'S BURGR after seeing it so many times in our previous trips.  There was a little bit of a line at 2 PM on a Monday but there is usually a line at least 5-10 parties deep when we came any other time.   The love the signage in front of the restaurant - there are two long rods that are emitting fire (of course haha) and it's extremely \"Vegas-y\".  We were seated pretty much instantly and a server came to us pretty quickly and handed us our menus.  The menu was printed on a hip, laminated card and menu prices are in whole dollar amounts.  We ordered the Burnt Ends Poutine and the Hell's Kitchen Burger to Share.  Burnt Ends Poutine (3/5) - fries with black pepper gravy, cheddar, cheese curds, pickled red onions (yum), burnt ends.  This was a pretty HUGE appetizer - I would recommend sharing!  It was a pretty flavorful poutine with the black pepper gravy spread all over the fries.  I personally thought the gravy was a bit thick but the pickled red onions were REALLY good at cutting through everything.  Hell's Kitchen Burger (3.5/5) - Bun with black and white sesame seeds topped with a patty, asadero cheese, roasted tomatoes and jalapenos + a jalapeno mayo sauce.  It was an okay burger - the flavor was good but the burger itself was a bit cold.  The other complaint was that the bun was SUPER dry so it made the burger not as tasty since everything else was pretty lean and not fatty.  All in all, probably would come back again but definitely want to try different things.  Our server was great and didn't experience anything bad service wise!",

First I must warn you of the wait! I came here with a friend around 9pm hoping the line would've died down some, but to our disappointment, we found ourselves standing in the middle of the Planet Hollywood casino at the end of a 50m long line. I gave up keeping track of time, but it must've been over an hour total, which is also partly due to the fact that THE WAITERS ARE SOOO SLOWW!! it literally took 15 minutes for us to put in our order after being seated and literally, I kid you not 45 minutes for our food to arrive. If it was steak, understandable, but these are just flippin burgers! If anything, it was this exorbitant Disneyland-like wait time that destroyed my experience here.  Then the burger arrived. I ordered the hells kitchen burger and it was... Alright. I was hoping to melt into that first bite, but it seemed that the first bite melted away too quick. The bun was for some reason a little too soft and almost soggy and the patty fell apart when I bit into it, almost like mushy cafeteria food. The taste was up there and I did enjoy the spiciness of the pepper coupled with the savory tones of the burger, but the texture and delivery was way off in my opinion. For $17 + tax + tip, this almost seemed like a rip off.   Had I known in advance, I probably would not have dined here.",

Honestly, I could've gotten the same satisfaction from Red Robin. And the Parmesan truffle fries are joke. Almost no truffle oil, some half shredded/half grated Parmesan cheese that you'd put on spaghetti, and you charge $12?!

    "text": "I literally just walked out because the service was horrible! I was in line for about 10 minutes when the bartender announced they had a spot at the bar for one so I was able to skip the madness.   After about 5 minutes, the bartender takes my order. I order the ultimate cheeseburger, truffle fries and a lemonade. I have them bring the fries out before the burger. My fries come and I still haven't received my drink or given a napkin and utensils. About 10 minutes later, my burger comes out but I still don't get my drink or a napkin and utensils. After a few minutes, I'm pissed beyond words so I ask for a to go box.   I then hand him my credit card and ask him to take off the drink because he never gave it to me. He says, \"why didn't you ask for it?\" I just look at him because at this point he is just being ridiculous. He asks if I want the $4 fountain drink to go and I said no. He gives me my card back but no receipt to sign. I wait around a few minutes and still nothing so I get up and start getting my stuff together so I can go. He finally asks if I'm paying with cash. I said no, I gave you my card and you gave it back and didn't say anything or give me a receipt. He then says \"well I can't separate the the drink without a manager.\" At this point, I am ready to go off so I said just give me the drink to go so I can go. I probably should have talked to the manager but I was too pissed to have a professional conversation. This was the absolute worst $35 I have ever spent in my 39 years of life.",

    "text": "I would like to start off by saying that my friend and I waited about an hour to eat at this place... and it was sooooo worth it!!! We almost left because we saw a massive line around 5 o'clock (aka dinner time) but decided to wait it out. I am so glad we did!   Once we were seated it did take some time for us to be acknowledged and get our food, but they were busy. As soon as our waiter gave us water we immediately told him our order to speed things along and when he brought us our food we asked for the bill right then because we wanted to keep things moving along.  On to the food. Besides being a little overpriced (it's Vegas baby) and not coming with any sides (you have to order separately), this was probably the best burger I have ever had! I ordered the \"Pork Chop and Applesauce Burger\" and OMG was it not the best thing I have ever eaten!! It was the perfect way to start my trip! This burger had a pork patty (like wut???), dubliner cheese, branston pickles (which is a pickley-chutney I believe), APPLE BRAISED PORK SHANK ON IT, and a super yummy cabbage-apple slaw that just completed it! It was a little smaller than expected (especially for $17) but so tasty. We shared the truffle-parm fries ($12) and we had a bunch left over. They were thickly (thicc) cut and the sauces they came with were so flavorful (an aoli-like white sauce and a curry ketchup I think?).   All in all, I loved this burger. Yes, it was small. Yes, we waited a long time and didn't receive immediate service upon sitting. And yes, it's pricey. BUT, this burger had some serious flavor and they were all very unique!   My advice: go early and try a unique burger that you can't try anywhere else!",

We were seated immediately because we went at 2:30 in the afternoon, but be warned that it isn't a large restaurant so wait time can be bad. After ordering, burgers take about 30 minutes to come out, with the option of your fries coming out before or with your burger.   My fiance got the Hog Heaven which is a pork burger with BBQ pork and tons of other meaty toppings. Although he went in with a huge appetite, he could only polish off a little more than half. I ordered the Patriot Burger, which is a turkey burger with smoked Gouda, cherry chutney, spicy mayo and crunchy topping. I LOVED it, and after peeling off over half of the bun, I was totally able to finish mine. The fries were tasty, and we found it more than enough to share an order.   I would certainly be back during non-peak times, but I'm interested in his steakhouse now, too!",

The tables are smallish and the chairs are large and comfortable. The dining area is a touch cramped.  The food was reasonably priced considering GR's name is attached to it and as you might expect, it was fantastic. We both had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and fries. Both burgers were cooked to the perfect temperature. Not as spicy as I expected so for those of you who \"can't handle spicy food\", this is a 2 of 10 on the spicy scale.  The French fries were thick and cooked to a crispy golden brown. The chipotle ketchup was fantastic.  The most striking thing for me was this: when the young man who was responsible for clearing, cleaning, and resetting tables was doing his work, he was so thorough and paid great attention to detail. That says volumes to me about the culture of the restaurant and their commitment to quality and guest experiences.",

I got the hog which had decent flavor but the patty was just not very moist (prob due to waiting on all of our orders to get out at the same time). Personally I think hopdoddy burgers have better flavor, both for the burgers and truffle fries. I'm not complaining about the meal by any means, it was overall decent.

They have a variety of options (including a HK burger) to satisfy all types of eaters.   Blue cheese burger for $15 did not disappoint our taste buds. But the real stars of the show were the truffle fries ($12) and the off-the-menu special anniversary burger for $22. A lot has been said about the fries already, but let me tell you about this special burger. Yes, $22 is a lot in general. No, it's not a lot in Vegas. It was perfectly cooked to the requested temperature, the added brisket and frisee plus whatever else was on there was a great accompaniment to the meat - without outshining the star of the show.   Only negative, the service was slooowww. The tables seating after us received their food at a variety of different paces, so it wasn't like us waiting over 45 minutes for burgers and fries was atypical for that date. Perhaps the expeditor lost our ticket? Dunno.",

    "text": "Came here after some great recommendations, and seeing they had the impossible burger but god, was the service disappointing. First of all, an upcharge of $6 for a vegan patty is absurd!  So I asked the server, Renee, what sauces were vegan and how I could make a vegan option. She told me I could only do the mushroom burger, marked V on the menu. I then had to explain to her that the V, as stated on their menu is vegetarian. She didn't seem concerned, and i opted to do an impossible patty with avocado, lettuce and tomato. My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen. She told us it would be about 30 minutes, great.   So after about 20 an impossible burger comes out with cheese and pickles. Obviously not what I ordered so I politely explained to the food runner, he said he'd fix it. Instead of re-making my food, they decided to just scrape the cheese off. Big NO NO in food service. I, not so politely, pointed this out to the server to which she responded \"I don't know what they did back there, that's on them\". Cool, thanks. She brings it back to the kitchen.   It's now been 30 minutes. The lady next to us who ordered after we did had gotten her food and i was starting to wonder where my boyfriend's burger was. We looked at the bill that our server had placed in front of us and discovered she never rang his burger in at all. Awesome! So we ask to talk to a manager. The manager, who's name I did not get, was pretty nice and apologetic about the situation. She ended up comping our burgers and finally, they came out correctly.   In the meantime, our server was switched to Teresa. She actually came over and checked on us and was really friendly. She was probably the only good thing about this whole experience.   The impossible burger was average at best, I've had better. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his burger. The fries were alright, I was not a fan of the ketchup options. Overall, average, overpriced food with terrible service.",

    "text": "I've been to this restaurant since it opened. It has been amazing after construction, after the price increases, and for a year after those unwanted changes.   However, this last visit was the worst experience in both service and quality of food. I will elaborate.   The wait was the standard 30 minutes on a summer weekday dinner @ 8p. We met some lovely guests in the line who were excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay's burgr. They, too, had been there many times pre-construction, who coincidentally recommended Bobby flays burger palace over this restaurant due to the increase in prices (foreshadowing ).  We got seated and we ordered the chicken sliders and the farmhouse burger. I have been ordering the farmhouse burger since the first time I came to this location.   The chicken sliders had great texture and flavor. The fried chicken had a crisp crunch and the condiments gave the burger creaminess. However, it was heavily over-seasoned. The salt was so heavy handed.   The farmhouse burger was cooked well. The yolk was runny and the meat was cooked perfectly. However, the bacon had unrendered bacon fat. As a result, it was a chewy white fat drenched in oil that was slathered on top of the whole burger. I couldn't eat it. Additionally and unfortunately, they changed their bacon from the thick cut to the \"store-brand\" thinly cut bacon, which was a horrible change (likely implemented to increase profits). So I called the waitress over and showed her the stringy white fat from the bacon. I would've been fine if I got another burger without unrendered bacon fat. However, the waitress said, \"It's supposed to come out like that.\" This got me upset. So everyone gets unrendered bacon fat? I've worked the hamburger grill for a long time during my humble beginnings in college and I never served white bacon fat.  On a side note, I really regret not taking a picture, because the waitress took the dish away.   For me, it's a level of standard and understanding from the waitress. When we are paying $15-17 for a burger and it's not cooked properly just bring out another one. No need to patronize a customer.  Later, I saw the plate being shown to the head chef, who talked to another chef about the cook of the bacon. And they swiftly made another one. Simple fix.   Service and food quality has gone down. Look at my previous review, I used to love this place. But I think Bobby's burger palace has taken the top burger spot in Vegas... Give us back our quality, Gordon.",

They were all delicious but my favorites are the hog dawg and onion rings. I asked them to put the cheese sauce for the dog on the side because I don't like soggy bread. I'm glad I did because the cheese was a bit much for me and my husband. The burgers were really juicy and fresh.

Once inside our server came right away took our order and that's when we waited another hour for our burgers. We got 3. Backyard burger which is your basic cheeseburger. The farmhouse burger which had cheddar, bacon and a fried egg, the burger with bleu cheese and 1 order of truffle Parmesan fries. I hate bleu cheese let me just say that but the hubby likes it and that's what he ordered. Let me tell you!!! WOW that burger was amazing. Made me like bleu cheese. It was delicious and worth the wait. The farmhouse was good it would've been better with some fried onions on it! The fries were okay I've had better truffle fries.

Waited awhile to be greeted but once we did the server was energetic and polite. We ordered duck poppers, Hell's burger, and Hog Dawg. Duck poppers were amazing. I split the Hell's burger with a friend but unfortunately a piece of the toothpick was stuck in part of my burger. Then, they also brought out the Hog Burger instead of the Dawg.

    "text": "I am not a fan of Gordon Ramsay. However, my date is so we ended up here as part of his bucket list to try one of the restaurants. We stopped by at noon so there was no line up. I tend to avoid lines if I can because I do not want to spend my vacation time in a line if I do not have to. Plus, as I read in previous reviews, they make burgers in patches so you have to wait for some time depending where your burger order is in the line.   We were seated right away, but it took another 35 minutes after we placed our order to receive our food. We ordered the two most popular burgers - Hells' Kitchen Burger and Farmhouse Burger. We also ordered truffle fries to share. I was facing the kitchen area and got to watch the staff make the food. The part I did not like was the fries and onion rings are also made in batches and would sit under the heating lamp until the burgers were ready. Think of how not crispy the fries are when they arrive at your table. It would have been better to just serve the fries fresh out of the fryer. I also found the fries to be too salty as the parmesan is scooped and sprinkled over the top portion of the fries and not mixed in.   I ordered the Hells' Kitchen Burger well done but the patty was medium well. I could still see parts of the patty with pink meat. I was not gonna send my burger back and wait for another one to be made after waiting so long for the order. The topping combinations were good. The bun was soft and paired well with the burger.   Our server checked up on us once shortly after the food arrived. We had to wave and get her attention to refill our water cups as my glass was empty and she never did rounds to refill water until asked.   Overall, I would only recommend trying one of the burgers if you are a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and show up early to avoid the lines. I would not revisit unless my date wanted to stop by here again.",

We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was just okay, the avocado pieces were cut way too big and we had to take them out and cut them in thinner slices. Also ordered the Hog burger and it was really good, I would recommend, the patty was wrapped with bacon and all the flavors worked well together. We also ordered a side of truffle fries and it was not worth it at all for $11 it was too salty and it was giant steak fries. I think it would be better if they were regular thinner fries. The creme brulee Oreo shake was amazing, I would recommend as well. Overall I would probably return if there was no wait.",

There was a huge line to eat here and I just felt I would get more out of this experience. Gordon Ramsey I feel is Famous for putting up a show and good food! I would've enjoyed my Vegas Burger experience if maybe his waiters had people giving samples of food or introducing the menu to people so people can order faster, Idk all I know is I was wearing heels and in that line it was not the business and the service was ok, not exceptional or anything...this was a blah experience. But I guess you can be cool and take a picture by a fire wall (?)",

    "text": "Let's just say to start that I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. This restaurant however, shows some serious irony as to how he shows himself on television when it comes to running a kitchen.   To start we had the kettle chip nachos. These had a nice flavor and the meat was tender.   We ordered the Hog Burger and the Ultimate Cheeseburger with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries. We ordered the ultimate cheeseburger medium rare and the hog burger well. We were told that the burgers take at least twenty minutes to come out since they are made fresh to order. We had no problem with the wait.   The burgers arrived.... the ultimate cheeseburger was cooked perfect and had great seasoning and flavor in the first bite... the next bite and the rest ended up tasteless and boring. The cheese even lacked flavor.   The hog burger, that was just under cooked. When getting to the middle of the burger the pork was cold, mushy and well... was just raw.   When we brought it to the attention of the waitress, now this is where it gets good, her response was, \"Well that is the type of pork it is.\" We showed her that the middle was cold and raw and she continued by saying, \"The chef says that it is the type of burger that no matter how long you cook it the meat stays red and that the center doesn't cook all the way, that it is the way it should be.\" I tried not to laugh. Kitchen Nightmares flashed in my head and I could picture Gordon Ramsay saying,\"You bloody idiot\".   The sad part is this restaurant bares the name of Gordon Ramsay a man who prides himself on how food is prepared and consistency of what comes out of his kitchens. I am just hoping that serving raw pork is not what his chefs think is best for his customers.   In this case they should be embarrassed.",

I don't like pink in my burger-- it grosses me out. I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. I also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. The cocktails are very strong! And yummy.  In less than 4 minutes my burger and fries came out. My burger looked delicious, until I bit into it. So raw, I could mush it (all I thought in this moment was that the cow was literally walking bc it was so rare, clearly I am obsessed with Ramsay). However, the ingredients were definitely fresh, the bun was perfect. The avocado was so huge, it was impossible to eat my burger without making a mess. So I mushed the avocado and then put it on my burger. No big deal, because it was a delicious and generous amount of avocado. The fries were a bit dry, somewhat crunchy, needed some salt, but tasted good once I dipped them in ketchup. You get a bunch of the French fries to share ($11).  I ate what was brown enough. The waitress said the manager took care of my burger which was really generous. I would come back for sure. But would probably choose a different burger and hopefully they make it well done next time I'm in Vegas.",

We both tried the ultimate cheeseburger which was very tasty. With the burger, we ordered fries and onion rings. Both of which were fantastic. It did take about 30 minutes for the burgers to arrive which the waiter did advise us. I suggest ordering the onion rings or an appetizer before the burgers come out like we did.

We also had the onion rings they are beer battered thick cut and come with two dipping sauces one chedder ranch the other chipotle ketchup it's enough to share.  Our previous visits we have had the truffle fries and they are great also. One other great thing is they accept total rewards comps. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.",

I got some pudding that tasted very plain like a 99 cent pudding. The line was very long and we waited but if a place is popular kudos to them. The staff is nice, the place is clean, no complaints in that department. The fire pit thing in front is a nice touch as well.

    "text": "It's a bit of a challenge going here with a large party, we definitely waited much longer than just waiting in the line and sitting separately. After about a 50min wait we finally got to our seats YAY! We already knew what we wanted since we had 50min to decide before we sat. I must say it was absolutely worth the wait not to mention they make everything fresh so the burger wait time is another 30 min or so. We had these bomb truffle fries while we waited for the deliciousness. I highly recommend the Hell's Kitchen Burger with bacon so full of flavor it tasted like Heaven despite coming from the kitchen of Hell lol pardon the corniness. My son had the Hog burger which was yummy as well a 1/4 beef patty wrapped in bacon topped with pulled pork and some sweet pickles to add some balance yum. I would definitely comeback and maybe just play some machines if a wait is necessary. Thanks again Chef Gordon",

    "text": "Burger is a great spot to visit in Vegas. For parties of two or less, stand in line ( next to the amazing wall of fire at the entrance) and wait to be seated. For parties of three or more, place your name on a list wth the hostess. If there is a wait, you will be texted once your table is ready, a very convenient feature which allows guests to go elsewhere on the Planet Hollywood floor. We were seated after a 20 minute wait. Our booth was roomy and comfortable (note-the majority of seating in the restaurant was booths...a feature I LOVED). Drinks were ordered and the server provided helpful tips across the board. We ordered the kettle chip nachos as a starter-the brisket was tender, the chips were thick and well-seasoned, and the cheese was creamy (English cheddar cheese blended in with sour cream-delicious). I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger, and it was sensational. Juicy, tender, and bursting with flavor. The figgy jam and cheese were an amazing combination. The bread was soft and delicious. This burger was hands-down the best I have had in a while, definitely this year:) I even ordered mine \"well done\" which can frequently be too dry...it was not. It was a juicy flavor-explosion, and I am already planning our next visit.  We ordered truffle fries as well, to share. I love the thick-cut style, and the seasoning was nice. The truffle aioli, which accompanied the fries, was okay-honestly, the aioli seemed better suited to plain fries, since truffle on truffle was just a lot. But they were very good fries, and the ketchup was tangy and flavorful. Two thumbs up, definitely visit if you are in town.",

My first bite was so juicy and the balance of the cheese with umami of the beef was such a great balance. I got the blue cheeseburger, my boyfriend got the farm burger, and his cousin got the U.K. burger. Everyone at that table was amazed on the flavor of their burger. The fries weren't something new to me and the reason I'm giving a four star is because of our server. He got our order and gave us the check. Other people checked up on us, gave us the drinks, and the food. Also when he asked for our order he just starred us down instead of speaking up like \"and what would you like to order,\" honestly is it that hard to do? There was a line but they got us in pretty quick. And as I've already mentioned the burger was spectacular and would love to get another burger from here again. Thanks to the chef who made our burgers!!!",

My husband had to place the tip on his personal credit card because he can't tip with his business credit card. Though he asked the server 3 times, she still managed to put the entire bill $$$ on his personal card. Now I'm jumping through hoops with the bank to get the charge removed :(",

    "text": "This restaurant is terrible value in my book.  The service is terribly slow.  We (party of two) waited ten minutes to be seated (not a big deal), then after we ordered our drinks (water) it took another ten minutes to get them and be able to put our order in (not a big deal).  Then, it took us almost an hour for us to get our food (very big deal).  The menu is essentially just burgers and fries (we ordered two burgers and one order of fries) which are two of the simplest and fast cooking meals one could order at a sit-down restaurant (an entire industry known for \"fast food\" is built around burgers and fries).  It should never take that long to serve these items.  Again, service was inattentive.  We tried the sauce that came with the fries and didn't like it so we waited at least five minutes for our server to walk by so we could ask for Ketchup.  She said sure and returned with a third cup/dish of the same sauce.  We both tried it and looked at each other in amazement.  We waited at least five more minutes to be able to ask if there was any real Ketchup.  We were advised that there was not.  This put us over the edge.  My girlfriend like simple burgers with Ketchup and I, having already started eating mine (we were starving when we sat down), felt like the burger was mediocre (not a difficult item to make tasty).  Additionally, the fries (more like potato wedges) were bland and mostly hard - a condition that would have been easily mitigated with some Ketchup.  We finished our burgers in extreme disappointment.  Upon finishing, it took another 5-10 minutes for our plates to be cleared and then another five or so for our check to come back.  After providing my credit card, it took 5-10 minutes for it to be picked up and several more to be brought back to sign.  Once I had the check signed, we waited for our server to return to ask for a box for the nearly untouched order of fries so we could take them home and eat after getting our hands on some Ketchup.  We waited at least five minutes.  She came back shortly with the box and we promptly left the table.  On my way out, I spoke with the/a manager and advised him that the operations of the restaurant are poor and need work.  I also strongly suggested that the restaurant, a \"traditional American\" burger joint offer real Ketchup to which he responded \"that will never happen.\"  That doesn't bother me because I will never eat there again, but I think it highlights a major issue with the restaurant.  The restaurant is not focused on providing a premier dining experience for customers but is solely geared toward attracting people with the brand name.  As is evidenced by the restaurant name, and Gordon Ramsay's face all around the restaurant as if he is superhuman, this restaurant, and Gordon Ramsay, is the poster-child for arrogance.  This is an expensive burger-joint.  $15 for just a burger, with no slaw or fries included.  Burgers are an easy dish - creating your own doesn't make you special.  Fries are simple as well.  Homemade fries are great, and always a little unique.  But let's not pretend as through they are a specialty item.  And Ketchup.  Well, Ketchup has been around a long time and is an All-American condiment.  To suggest that Gordon Ramsay could create a house sauce that is so good that nobody would ever prefer real, traditional Ketchup...is insane.  To call the house sauce \"Ketchup\" is misleading.  Not to mention that the sauce is actually terrible.  It tastes nothing like Ketchup and, to us, resembled a smoky shrimp cocktail sauce.  All said, I could never recommend this place. Food is sub-par, service is poor, and customer satisfaction is not a priority.  Arrogance permeates the atmosphere as the restaurant relies on the brand name to lure customers to pay high prices for cheap food.  Note:  The couple sitting next to us left in disgust shortly after receiving their meals.  We were only able to infer that something was terribly wrong with the food.  Either a grossly undercooked burger, a hair or other item in the food, or...no Ketchup (I had seen her spreading a giant glob of sauce on her bun/burger shortly before the server was beckoned to her.  The woman asked that her plate be taken away and declined an offer for any substitute dish.  The man stopped eating and asked for the check.  The manager who I ultimately spoke with, brought the couple the check and made an apology.  Note, he still brought the check which the man paid (over $60).  This does not seem like a genuine apology nor does it indicate any acceptance of responsibility on behalf of the restaurant.",

Settled for the UK burger and was a great decision. 6.  Onion rings came out quickly and were outstanding. Very light batter that held up to frying and the two sauces provided. Sauces were nice mix between sweet and spicy. 7.  Despite delay, burger was cooked perfectly. Love the toasted bun with sesame (light and dark). Fries were solid. Not greasy. Nicely salted -- and I like a lot. 8.  Server was very attentive with refills, as we were just doing tea and soft drinks that afternoon. 9.  Everyone cleaned their plates and we got out in a timely manner to head back to casinos/shopping/people watching. 10.  Exactly what you would expect from Ramsey. Perfection expected and delivered.  He might have dropped a few F-bombs on the timeliness but the food was outstanding.",

I don't know if they ruined the order of two simple burgers on purpose so out of stupidity I'm hoping it is out of stupidity. The place has a decent line because Gordon Ramsay has a good name although the food and the people working there will quickly change that. I ordered a plain burger for myself and a burger with cheese for my girl the lady wrote down what I wanted in the burger which was just lettuce and onions well-done with no cheese. For these two burgers we had to wait about an hour and 15 minutes then to just get disappointed not only was the order completely wrong the burger was not cooked at all which begs the question, why did she even bother writing down my order if they were just going to give me some random burger instead. Opened the box just to be extremely disappointed about the taste the quality of the meat besides for how rude and nasty the workers were you are hoping that the food would be up to Gordon Ramsay's expectations although unfortunately you unfortunately will be disappointed beyond your dreams just save your money and go to a cheap a burger place that will actually get the order right and you'll enjoy the burger to without an hour wait for raw Burger. I hope instead of just making the food for his next restaurant Gordon Ramsay can just make sure the people working there don't ruin his good name. Save your money time and headache anywhere else is more satisfying.",

The meat just softly melts in your mouth and it's so juicy and flavorful. The buns were the perfect texture to complement the soft meat. Overall I was in love and I can't wait to try another one of his restaurants.   Gordon Ramsay,  teach me your ways!",

I've wanted to try this place for many years, and was not ready for the journey I was about to take. I don't know how one person can conjure up this magical of a burger, but it damn sure makes me a believer of the Gordon Ramsay food cult. My goodness, how in the world can a burger be this good!? And not only that, but then we had the two different types of ketchup that came with the fries and that was magical, too?? To top that off, our waiter hooked us up with the truffle aioli and the cheddar ranch dips to try, and I thought I was going to melt in my chair. How? How can one place have so many amazing flavors in one place? It blew my mind, no doubt about it. I can't wait to go back. In fact, from now on, every other burger not from this restaurant will just be a disappointment. And that, my friends, is how you make the perfect burger.",

The bun with light and fluffy and was a nice complement to the meat. The burgers were cooked appropriately to my medium request. The house ketchup was excellent. However for a 45 minute wait and 20 dollar burger I expect to have some kind of unique beef like an aged prime beef that is ground in house. The burger itself was bland. The toppings were all unique and quite good. But For 18-22 dollars per burger and 60 dollars for lunch I expect more. Save yourself some time and money and go to earl of sandwich right down the hall.",

No, sir waiter, you did not hear me incorrectly - I am requesting my non-alcoholic dessert drink to arrive, flying on a beautiful unicorn, well before my humongous burger and onion rings. Sil vous plait.   Yah. That milkshake was fan-frickin-tastic. The creme brulee is a delicious layer resting on a creamy Oreo milkshake.   Tried the farmhouse burger - the meat was cooked to perfection, and the fried egg on top just makes everything ten times better. Sides are ordered separately at this joint, so the table ordered the Parmesan onion rings, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries. Onion rings - crispy and delicious. I was told the sweet potato fries were amazing thanks to the powdered sugar shaker they serve with it. I was told the truffle fries were meh. Everyone seemed to like the burgers they ordered.   The vibe is hip and the service was great. I hear the average wait time is 30-45 minutes, but they do text you when the table is ready so you could roam the casino in the mean time. We got there around 11 after the concert and had no wait. Definitely check this place out!!",

My expectations were high because of Gordon Ramsay and i must say it was delicious the burger was perfect, it wasn't dry everything on the Farmhouse burger was cooked perfectly the fries were nice and crunchy the environment was good. I would totally love to come back to this burger joint whenever i could and i would recommend it to any people who are skeptical about trying it! My next place to try is Hells Kitchen.",

Proportion of patty to bun to everything else was spot on. Patty was perfectly seasoned. The bun was nice and fluffy without being too soft and chewy. Had the perfect amount of mango chutney - just a touch, not too much.  Would recommend the lemonade - really smooth and refreshing on the 110 degree day I went.  Also the bar is a great place to chat up others who happen to be there by themselves because, say, they're in town with their husband or friend who is busy at a work conference. :) Super wide and cushy chairs.",

Located near the entrance of Planet Hollywood, I arrived on a Wednesday night at around 9pm with a coworker and there was about 30-40 people in the line when we got there.  I don't think that was unheard of and likely on the weekends you're looking at a potentially way bigger lineup.  Surprisingly, we only waited about 10 minutes to get seated so kudos to the staff.  There are a wide selection of burgers on the menu (You have to order any sides completely separately but this being in the center of the strip, that's about standard for the prices they are charging).  I had the blue cheese burger and it was excellent.  You can tell the burgers are high quality and they asked how you want the burger done.  I got it medium rare which is what I recommend as well.  The burger I got was around $16-$17 but was well worth it.  I would love to come back and try other options on the menu but I was definitely satisfied with this visit.  The restaurant can seat quite a few people so don't get discouraged with the longer lineup that you may see.",

In any case. Staff was a bit too casual if you ask me. One staff member loudly saying to the bartender how he lost his virginity to that song (kinda funny) but then proceeding to talk about how the other guy is going to get fired, etc.  Now to the actual burger. Got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Good combo with the jalapeno, guac, avo, but overall unimpressive. Slightly overcooked patty, but more troubling was that it wasn't exactly a great patty.   More troubling is the fact that the extra Truffle Fries I ordered (yes, Fries cost extra)... were actually Chips (the English kind, not the Lays/Pringles kind) instead of fries. Now since most Americans restaurants serve fries for their \"Fish & Chips\" instead of Chips, I'll give him a pass on this one, but seriously he should know better.  Then again he's probably re-using them on his Fish & Chips joint few blocks down the road.  Overall, not sure what I was thinking having a Brit make me a burger :)",

So the wait wasn't bad at all.   Our waitress was really lovely! We ordered quickly because we decided what we wanted while waiting in the queue. I had the blue cheese burger , hubby had the Gordon Ramsey ( Hell's Kitchen) Burger and we shared fried ( the fries are huge and enough for 2 -3 people). The food took really long to come out of the kitchen ( like 30 maybe 35 minutes). The wait was worth it because the burger and fries was delicious! Probably the best burger I have ever had. I'll definitely be going back to try a few other burgers while I'm in Las Vegas.   For vegetarians - they have a portobello mushroom burger which sounded amazing! I might have that one when I go back.   Tip- it's quite warm sitting by the glass window as there's a display fire .",

I can't tell you the exact names of the burgers we had, but we both had something different, and felt the exact same..best burger ever.

The bun was excellent.  The nachos tasted good but had way too much cream sauce. The onion rings were tasty. They come in this cone holder. The not so good part was the bottom rings got soggy with oil. Which made them unappetizing. Would I go eat there again? Probably not.",

They revamped their menu but some of the classics are still there like the farmhouse burger (my favorite) The sweet potato fries are still great and unchanged.  But come on, you can get a good burger anywhere on the strip.  The Jalapeno poppers truly was my big draw to this place.",

We got into the restaurant very quickly and actually got to sit in front of the kitchen and see the food prepared. However, our order took 45 minutes to cook all the while several people came and got their food quicker than us even though they ordered later. I got the barnyard burger which was rather bland and mediocre in general. I also got the Parmesan fries; they were much like the restaurant: high hopes quickly dashed by an average product. In the end I would like to give them another chance but I am certainly going to give preference to other restaurants in the area first.",

We got to the restaurant around 6:45 and there was a huge line waiting to get seated. Parties greater than three can go directly and check in without waiting in line. Once we checked we were told the wait would be an hour. After getting seated an hour later we had a rude waiter that was rushing us to order. He told us that burger take 30 mins to make so it's better to order an appetizer until the food comes so we needed up ordering the truffle fries, Mediterranean burger, fish burger, Hell's Kitchen burger and the farmhouse burger. After placing the order we waited around for the truffle fries since he said appetizers will be brought out but everyone around us with a different waiter got their fries while waiting for the burgers. We waited for the waiter to come check on us for more drinks or additional orders but he never did so we ended up calling him over after 30 mins and he said your fries will come out with the burger. If that was the case I don't know why he told us to order apps. Anyways another 25 mins goes by and finally our food came out. I have to say the burgers were all extremely good but definitely not worth the 2 hour wait. The truffle fries were a huge disappointment though.  I just wished the server we had better customer service and at least checked on us once to see if we needed anything. Was really disappointed considering it's Ramsay's restaurant.",

The onion rings were outstanding and the burgers were good but they claimed because they had new menu items they couldn't take a sauce off one of them. My biggest complaint is all through the meal they left dirty dishes on the table and no one seemed to care. I think the long lines because of Gordon are going to this places head.

That being said, we went on a Thursday morning, right before they were about to open, at 11am, and already there was a line of at least 15 ppl waiting to be seated. Definitely come right at opening time if you don't want to wait, this place fills up fast.   I ordered the forest burger, which had duck bacon and mushrooms which was pretty good. Portion size, I actually expected their burgers to be a little bigger than what was given to me...but overall it was a good sized burger. Definitely tender and juicy. However, what I really loved about this place were the truffle Parmesan fries! One order was enough for 4 ppl..and we definitely asked for a side of extra truffle sauce!",

The line can be quite a wait but if you have a party of 4 or more can go by a bit quicker with preference for larger parties  Onto the food. I had one of the best burgers I've ever tasted in my life. Great quality meat and condiments. The ambience is amazing along with the friendly staff. Will def be checking this place out while in Vegas in the near future",

The ketchup had some chipotle and I thought I didn't like that spice, but it was yummy there. I also had the salad with shrimp and apples. It had the perfect amount of dressing. The caramel shake was good too and I don't even like caramel very much. It is a little bit more expensive than other burger places in Vegas, and there are countless burger places these days, but the food is worth the price! Best burgers in Vegas!",

We were almost done eating by the time we got finally got the fries. I tried to flag our  waiter down to get him a check, and he said \"what do you want?!?\". Sheesh. Worst service EVER.

He ordered a Brooklyn Lauger on tap and it was flat, no suds and the glass smelled.  The beer was skunk and tasted like those beers you got back in the day of HS.  Then, the burger came- was JUST ok and the onion rings were gross! To top this all off- not one drink was comp'd And bill was expensive.  Huge disappointment from a restauranteurs establishment that prides himself on quality!  I make better manhattans and burgers at home!  Bartender had no idea how to make any cocktails!  Manhatten was in a highball glass....",

Super juicy and flavorful! Did not miss the meat at all! The bun was perfect too! The burger stayed together without turning into a huge mess. Besides, they cooked it super fast and brought it to me within 10 minutes! Other people had to wait for their meat burgers to cook for over 25 minutes. The line to this place is always super long too, but it's totally worth it and moves pretty fast. Can't wait to come back to Vegas for Christmas and pay this place a few more visits! :)",

Not that it seems like they care anything about a customer, too busy looking pretty.  The waitress also seemed uninterested in taking care of me, just going thru the motions. All of this is quite annoying and makes me rather uninterested in the upcoming burger I ordered. No matter what it tastes like it's highly unlikely I will ever return here. Okay the burger arrived, it looks outstanding and tastes okay. That's right, okay. It's big and juicy but lacks flavor. The fries are actually steak fries and they're very good, but served with a weird tasting homemade ketchup.  I'm glad I came here so it's no longer a mystery. What I can now say for certain is that Bobby's Burger Palace across the street is exponentially better in every aspect but most importantly Bobby's burger is far superior!",

After waiting in line outside, I expected to walk in and see a cool vibe restaurant... nope!  Considering it's at the Planet Hollywood, expected a hip, young feel. Nope!  This place is 2 steps up from a Red Robbin.  Here's what we ordered: Poutine - Not the best. The flavor just lingered on in my mouth (and not in a good way). Onion Rings - So so. It was a different kind of batter.  Hell's Kitchen Burger - It was good Blue Cheeseburger - It was good Ultimate Cheeseburger - Not great   Crispy Cherry Pepper Chicken - Terrible. It had no flavor. I ended up sending it back. Literally 0 flavor to the chicken and it's not a battered crispy chicken. It's crispy because it's cooked skin on. Kind of gross!  Mediterranean Burger - Ordered this as a substitute for the chicken. The meat was tender but everything else was a mess. I literally scraped off the toppings and just ate the meat and buns by itself.  Parmesan Truffle Fries - Awful. It was disgusting! We barely touched it.   Half our meals were left on the plate. The only reason why I'm even giving it 2 stars is because the waiter was so pleasant and kind enough to switch out the chicken plate (which he suggested would be delicious).   We should have just gone to in-n-our lol. I can't believe this is a Gordon Ramsay establishment.  This was a terrible dining experience!",

We ordered our food and they asked us if we wanted all our items to come at the same time (which we opted for) and it took another 30 mins until we got to eat.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Just Fries. I asked for medium rare and low and behold, it came out medium rare! The burger was very juicy and you can really taste the jalapenos.   I'd come back to this restaurant again if I was in Vegas (but would definitely take note of how long the wait times are)",

You can then roam around and head back to the restaurant once you receive a text. Better than standing in line imo. The restaurant is plenty big so the wait wasn't too long. For a Sunday lunch Fourth of July weekend party of 3 waited for about 30 minutes.  I got the Hell's kitchen burger and it was delicious. Has a little bit of a kick to it. I am a big fan of avocado in burger and this one has plenty. I can do without the fries next time. They do have vegetarian options but they are limited.  Would come back.",

Our Waitress name was Wendy and from the time we sat down she was grouchy. Here are some of the things that made us upset. Started with 1) we waiting 30 mins for our food and she didn't come back to check on us 2) we asked to keep on menu for keep sake and she just fling the menu on the table 3) we asked for ketchup and she gave us a look like \"what the hell\" 4) she was bending down to take another table's order and we saw her butt crack 5) the worst of all; my cousin ordered a medium well but when we got the burger it looked really pink. So we asked her if we can get it cooked longer. and she said no it is always red. And just walked away!!!!!! RUDE!!   When we got the bill we asked for her name. and after that...... she became nice. Wow right! Asking is if we needed a box. If we was doing okay. So after we went to the hostess desk to ask for a manager. And here comes Wendy with an eye on us. As we was talking to one of the girls asking for the manager. She buts in and asked if everything was okay...... (She knew we didn't like her service) Wow right. She was so rude!   Now another thing. When we asked for a manager, the front girls was giving us the run around on where he was. They didnt even know where he was. Basically there was no manager there. We ask 3 times if there was a manager There. The girls was stuck up and unwelcoming.   Not a place I would go again. Completely ruined my experience. Wanted to eat here and never again.   But flip side. The bus boy was super nice and smiling. The guy who brought out our food was really nice. We asked for ranch and he came back with it really fast. He also refilled out sodas with out us asking. And our glasses was not even empty and we had a fresh glass of soda.",

We tried getting something similar, but it just wasn't as good. Bummer.   Hubby is quite a fan of their Oreo milkshake. I like it because it's topped with creme brulee. Lol. Yum!

I've been here three times and all times were good and I don't even like burgers that much! But I am a die hard Gordon Ramsay fan so yeahh. My orders:   Forest burger: 5/5  Love this one! This is my go to burger - I love the mushrooms, quality of the meat (perfectly cooked), tasty, etc. it's also consistently good every time I come here.   Onion rings: 2/5  Ok not gonna lie onion rings were actually pretty salty and our whole group thought so. While I did like it it initially became hard to eat throughout the dinner because of all the oil and salt!   Fries: 3/5 Fries were also ok, it wasn't the softest but be sure to ask the curry ketchup! That actually made the fries better.   The most recent time I went here service was good, but they did forget to give us our appetizers (fries and onion rings) but they made it up by apologizing and comping it! so that was nice. Our waiter also catered to my demands as I did keep asking for extra onions and pickles and stuff and he made sure I got it!   The main reason I'm giving this place a 4/5 is cause their burgers are AMAZING (plus the curry ketchup) - our whole group thought so, but their appetizers are not the best. If I come back next time I'll just stick to the burgers.   I guess the weird thing is they give you refills of your drink before you're even done without you even asking. I mean it's nice but we actually didn't want more of the drink so we had like multiple cups of our soda LOL and overall it kind of wastes drinks but at least they're considering we might want refills LOL.",

We started with some of the duck poppers and they were awesome. Duck confit stuffed into little red peppers fried with some seasoned breading, so good! The U.K. Burger was crazy, the whole time I couldn't help but think, \"wow, this is literally as good as a burger gets\". I'm usually one to try different things on the menu, but next time I'm back I don't think I'll be able to resist the U.K. Burger! It was my girlfriend's birthday when we visited and they brought out this amazing white chocolate parfait. I've never forced myself to eat something so slowly that I wanted to eat so quickly... I'm seeing a lot of comments about slow service in other reviews but that wasn't the case for us, our server was awesome!

    "text": "Given how many go-to restaurants I have in Vegas, it's hard to make time for a new place. But I did manage to run out of places to go to (or in the case of Palace Station's Oyster Bar, little desire to wait longer than 30 minutes for it) due to being in Vegas for six days. Gordon Ramsay Burger had been recommended to me by, of all people, my local BBQ joint in L.A. (shoutout Ray's Texas BBQ!). And my friends also vouched for it as such. So yeah, the time was right to give it a try!  A note about the line, which I read about ad nauseum on multiple reviews on Yelp and was somewhat of a deterrent for me coming earlier. We came on a Tuesday around 1:30 pm, and the line moved very quickly. Like, we got in like and 10 minutes later we sat down. Obviously we came at a time that wasn't as busy, but I've been told that it's easier to sit down for lunch instead of dinner. So there's that, for what it's worth.  Anyways, we came here because we wanted to eat some delicious food! There were many delicious burgers on this menu, but the Farmhouse Burger stood out to me because who doesn't love a fried egg in their burger??? I can safely say that I made the correct choice. Have your burger cooked medium rare for maximum taste! Also, we got the trinity of proper sides here: truffle parmesan fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. All of them were great, but those truffle parmesan fries are TO DIE FOR! Would come back just for the fries (but yes, the burger is great too obviously).  And somehow, we had room for dessert! Had the sticky toffee pudding ice cream sandwich. It was the perfect way to cap our meal.  Service was great, no complaints here.  Overall had a great experience at Gordon Ramsay Burger. Would definitely come back, provided I don't have to wait in a very long line.",

The presentation on all of these dishes was outstanding.  The truffle fries served was decent portion served with ketchup-curry and a mustard aioli.  The fries were good had the earthy flavor you expect from truffle.  The farmhouse burger is in my top 5 all time for burgers, the burger was cooked perfectly medium.  The bun had a wonderful flavor with a nice sweet glaze.  The over easy egg compliments the burger well and the bacon was outstanding.  The shrimp-lobster burger was excellent I could tell when I was eating the lobster versus the shrimp.  The bun was outstanding as well and, I loved the Asian aioli and pickle that comes with it, compliments the seafood patty perfectly.  All n all an absolutely wonderful experience and meal, would definitely come back.",

Oh well. We put our names down and walked over to Bellagio to watch the fountain show. Before we knew it, we were back at the hostess stand to wait some more for our table to be cleaned. An hour and a half later...  I ended up sharing half a Foie Burger and half a Shrimp & Lobster Burger and some Truffle Fries. I don't know if we were starving or what but everything was delicious! The Foie Burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and it was so juicy. My friends got The Hell's Kitchen Burger and The Hog Burger (featured on Buzzfeed's Worth It and was Steven's Worth It winner). Not a single person was upset with their meal. The size of the burger is a good size -- not too big and not too small. As for the truffle fries, they were super tasty. They were great with the aioli and it was good with the curry ketchup we got on the side. You can definitely share one order of fries between two people. It was hefty meal and I definitely left feeling full.  I'm kinda mad about how good Gordon Ramsay Burger is! Even after eating the burgers, I was thinking about all the other burgers but that wait time at GR Burger ain't cute. :(",

That blonde hair, those blue eye, that British accent, and the way he calls people an \"idiot sandwich!\" 23 out of 10 would marry the guy and become Michael Ramsay.   Even though I have been to Vegas 50+ times, I have yet to go to any of his eateries. Maybe I had a fear of being disapointed by my man-crush but I never stepped foot into his restaurants until this last trip with some friends and the wife. They didn't accept reservations so we must have waited almost two hours for a table but it was worth the wait. I got the Shrimp & Lobster Burger and my wife got the Foie Burger. We ended up trading halves and sharing some truffle fries on the side.   That first bite had me pee-in-my-pants ecstatic. It was like the ocean punched me right in the kisser! And that Foie Burger! Holy mooing cow! So juicy and flavorful. All those times I was here in town and missing out on putting some Ramsay in my mouth. Dang it! I threw a dirty look at the wife for us having gone to her celebrity crush's \"Burger Palace\" and being disappointed. Her and her ginger-crush can marry each other because I'm loyal to Ramsay.  In all seriousness, they make a bloody good burger here. Stop by and fall in love with Gordon Ramsay. Burgers so good it'll give you gout!",

The burger I got had beef, cheese, butter lettuce, onions and tomato, and was good and was very filling. I personally liked the Greek Quinoa Salad more than the burger though, but I'm not so much a burger girl.   The only thing about this place that was awful both times I went was the terrible service. The first time I went there it took about 45 minutes for our food to come and it took us letting about three different waiters and the manager know about the situation. The next time I went there I ran into the same issue where my food took extremely long to come out and on top of it the table next to me was also very frustrated with the poor service.",

And let alone the SERVER didn't tell us that the FRIES are an extra charge... a 9$ charge... like that's a big difference.  We ended up getting a creme brulee milkshake for 10$ and it was honestly not the best... ID PREFER A DQ MILKSHAKE ALL DAY! We also ordered the chicken wings which came out insanely well honestly probably the BEST WINGS I've ever had!! But that made the whole meal so I Wasted the fries wasted the shake only ate the burger and spent around 65$ on the meal I would only order a select number of options and the guest service wasn't that great.. very close to other people eating and server hovered over waiting for bill and for us to decide for order...",

The burgers are quite large, cooked to perfection, bun is perfect, and the toppings work perfectly to create an amazing bite each time.

So we ordered \"the nachos\" pretty tasty not a lot of meat but whatever the cheese was so delish. I got the farmhouse burger our son got the cheese burger the husband got that giant hot dog and we shared the just fires. And for dessert we got the creme brulee Oreo milkshake!!!!

The prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. Burgers are between $15-$24. Everything is a la carte so fries are purchased separately; however, you can easily share an order of fries.

I had the Blue Cheese Burger and it was excellent, but I think it had too much blue cheese.  The bites with no blue cheese (or less) were much more enjoyable.  Wife had the Crown Burger and it was also good.  We left full and satisfied.  Prices not too bad for lunch on the strip.  Usually cheaper to eat, than gamble.",

And so our flight was a bit late We decided on Gordon Ramsay Burger. It is perfectly located next to the Paris Hotel inside Planet Hollywood,so we didn't have to go far and do a whole lot of walking. The wait wasn't very long even though there was a huge line.  Needless to say, it was well worth it.   I ordered his Blue Cheeseburger.  It is out of this world. Seriously one of the best burger ever!!! Kid u not the 7 ounce meat patty melts in ur mouth so incredibly flavorful and savory.  Not too big and not too small, and defiantly  not for sharing lol. And with all the other ingredients that came with it, arugula, spicy mayo, fig jam..... OMG my mouth waters. It's cooked to perfection, let's get that right (as Ramsay would say hehe).   Finished off my meal with a blood orange creamsicle. Excellent way to close off my pallets. It's just the right amount of sweetness and all the added \"dots\" around the plate is a must.  U have to literally clean off ur plate while u eat this creamsicle. It's a popsicle on a plate that has been elevated to a whole other leve. (Hehe another a Ramsay saying).  oh......btw..... the chocolate caramel crunch is to die for.  Just sayin'",

The service was immediate and friendly.   I first ordered has the hummus for an appetizer, which was superb. For the main meal, I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with asadero cheese, avocado, roasted jalapenos, roasted , and jalapeno aioli. It was cooked to perfection.  I can honestly say that this was among the top quality burgers I ever had in my life!  Highly recommended!",

Poutine is pretty fantastic as it already is.... but could it be made better by the addition of fatty pastrami??  YES is the answer.  The only problem is that this thing is huge and we filled up on it which made us appreciate the burgers less (which was OK because they were still epic as leftovers a few hours later).  Oh right, the burgers: - Farmhouse: yes a classic, make sure someone orders it. But there were some innovative (or optimized versions of previous idea) burgers that are really worth the visit: - Lobster and shrimp: perfect for the pescatarian in your group it comes out piping hot with some interesting sauce. - Hog Burger: instead of burger meat they use various rich fatty hog parts... bring an appetite though.  Too much poutine and you'll barely be able to do any damage!  Oh, and the cherry on the sundae was that GR himself actually showed up, toured the kitchen, and sat at a table where his security selectively let only some people say hi to him.  (It was a Sunday afternoon around 4pm.  We asked our server if this was a common situation and she said he stops by at random times, but more such times recently as he is working on Hell's Kitchen across the street.)  Maybe you'll get lucky.",

    "text": "Ah, Gordon Ramsay Burger - the serviceable alternative for customers who don't have the budget for Gordon Ramsay Steak, or the time and patience for Hell's Kitchen.   Ever since I got into food during my college days (go Bears!), I have always wanted to visit Gordon Ramsay Burger along the Las Vegas strip. For years, the image of a \"perfectly\" cooked burger that was invented by the renowned chef pilfered the inner chambers of my mind. If I could just have one nibble, I'd be set for life...  And finally, a couple weeks ago I actually had the opportunity to visit Gordon Ramsay Burger on a quick trip to Sin City. After a night of amazing steak at BLT (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/blt-steak-las-vegas-2\">yelp.com/biz/blt-steak-l...</a>), my girlfriend and I followed it up by getting gourmet burgers for lunch. Gordon Ramsay Burger was found right at the front entrance of the Planet Hollywood Casino, smack dab in the middle of the strip. It was definitely a good idea to come for lunch around noon because we ended up having to wait just around 15 minutes in line. I highly suggest going with a party of 2 or fewer during lunch time, otherwise you'll have to call ahead and maybe wait much longer than you'd want.  Despite the name recognition, Gordon Ramsay Burger was just a tad more than your typical casual burger joint. On top of the at least 17 (so many!!!) different burgers, this restaurant also served the usual assortment of scrumptious-sounding snacks, soups, salads, and desserts. When it came to the burgers, you could tell that this had \"Gordon Ramsay\" written all over it. There were ones that had curry, foie gras, and even lobster! Cost here was a bit pricey as you'd expect from something in Las Vegas, with most burgers going for around $16-$17 (doesn't include fries). My girlfriend and I ended up getting the Hell's Kitchen and Crown Burgers. Here's what we thought of the experience:  -- WORLD-CLASS BURGERS, BUT SOME FLAWS --  Don't get me wrong. We've never had burgers like the ones here - even at the best joints in California. The complex flavors, amazing textures ... it was glorious. But there were a lot of nitpicky things we personally didn't like.  1. Hell's Kitchen Burger (8/10): What I really loved about the Hell's Kitchen Burger were that the jalapenos had lots of fire, the avocado was fresh, and man the meat was cooked PERFECTLY! And one of the best parts to me, actually, was the bun. It was toasted well, plus the sesame seeds added an extra layer of crunch. However, it really bothered me that this burger was heavily lacking in sauce (where that aioli at??). Furthermore, the roasted tomatoes were extremely salty. Every bite offered an explosion of sodium-filled juice that overwhelmed the burger. Not bad, but so close...  2. Crown Burger (8/10): On my girlfriend's end, she felt very similarly about her Crown Burger. Though the arugula added a great crunch to a delicious patty of meat, she also echoed my sentiments about the lack of sauce and the saltiness of the tomatoes. Like me, she expected more.   -- SUPER CASUAL, TOURISTY ATMOSPHERE -- This place definitely had a great vibe for a chill meal. Lighting was good, tables were spacious enough, and I loved the comfortable seating. However, I thought it was geared WAY TOO MUCH towards tourists. Gordon Ramsay's picture was everywhere, his products were up for sale at the front, and the flames by the window that started out as a great marketing material became more of an attention-grabber later on.   -- EXCESSIVELY SLOW SERVICE --  For a very relaxed setting, you'd expect the food to come out pretty promptly. I mean, we weren't inside a five star steakhouse. But sadly, we ended up waiting almost 30 or so minutes before our food came out. Lots of nice people, but too slow for our liking.  If I had to put my finger on where Gordon Ramsay Burger would rank in regards to the top burger eateries I've ever had, it most likely wouldn't be at the top. Considering all factors - the food, price, atmosphere, and service - I'd say that this place is worth a visit in Vegas but definitely not worth dropping all your things for. I give it a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating.  Eat well and prosper,",

We went here for an early lunch and chose this place because of the famous chef. We arrived around 11am and there was no wait. I got the farmhouse burger and my friend got the forest burger and we also ordered truffle parmesan fries to share. My burger was good, but nothing too special about it. Maybe I didn't think it was super special in flavor because I chose a simple burger since my friend liked the burger she chose a lot. Both of us loved the truffle fries and the sauces which comes with it. The fries were placed in a cute cone-shaped container stand with sauces on the side.   The presentation of our food was very neat, which I appreciate since I tend to get bored of food when the presentation looks messy. I'd recommend this place if you want to try a unique burger.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  Let me start by saying that my wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans and we have been to this place 3 times before.  Each time was good except for this last (4th) time on July 1st, 2019.  Gordon sets high expectations and therefore, it is fun to see how his restaurants run.  This is what we noticed this time.    First thing we notice was there was no more Jalapeno Poppers, (WTF!!!!) who made that decision?  Instead now they have red pepper duck/ creamy type of poppers -- don't buy them they are a waste.  We also used to like their truffle fries.  Once again they were disappointing as they were undercooked.  Keep in mind this place isn't cheap.  No big deal.   My wife and I ordered the same burger which is the Hells kitchen burger (not sure of the exact name right now but its the first one on the burger list-- clearly one that they are proud of).    As we wait for the burger which takes a while, my wife notices a few blonde waitresses who are handling food, walking around with their hair down and constantly running their fingers through it.  Not sure what their policy is but all the other girls had their hair in a bun which seems much more professional and clean.  No big deal we just had to watch out for and be mindful that there may be some blonde hairs in our food.    Biggest disappointment was the burger.  We ordered it medium rare because that's what we like.  the burger comes out and sure enough it is medium rare as we can see some pink in the middle.  The only weird thing about this burger was that it was dry AF (As Freak).  How do you have a medium rare burger that is dry? I could literally cut the burger down the middle and no juice came out AT ALL.  I had to dip it in some left over sauce from the fries.    So here's the break down of the price v.s. what we ordered.  Two burgers, one order of fries, one order of red pepper poppers, one Bloody Mary, one glass of water = $104.18.  I understand its Vegas but I like paying for something good and this was far from it. This is the last time we eat here.    By the way our waitress was very nice and she deserves a 4 .  Save your money and go to the Wynn buffet (I'll write a review about that later).  While in Vegas we also went to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant inside the Cesars Palace.  I'll write a review about that as well but once again be ware. These Ramsay restaurants are not the same as before.",

Asked if we could sit at the bar and they said no because that's part of their seating. Thought that was weird.   We had a strange waitress. First. She was insanely annoyed when we didn't order drinks. She just walked off once we said that. She only came back to bring us food and to give us a check. She didn't come by to check on how our table was doing or if we needed anything.   I ordered hellfire wings and corn dip. The hellfire wings were cold by the time the food got to us. Honestly, I've had better wings at BDubs. The corn dip was good. The buttery popcorn was definitely weird. It says it's like Mexican street corn. That is incorrect. It didn't taste anything like street corn.   My friend got the veggie burger patty and her burger was also cold.   Only one person got food that was still hot.   My friend with the veggie burger got sick to her stomach last night after dinner. I was sick to my stomach this morning when I woke up.   Definitely won't be going to anymore burger joints by Gordon Ramsay.   The only good experience so far is Hell's Kitchen by Caesar's. Go there. Don't bother with the burger joints",

Specifically the Oreo Milkshake with Creme Brulee topping is possibly the best milkshake I've ever had. It's small and expensive, but we're in Vegas so it's worth every penny.  The burgers themselves are pretty good too. The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and balanced whereas The Crown burger I found to be over seasoned and a bit bland otherwise. The burger buns stand on their own though. They're soft and pillowy but also sturdy and soak up the burger juices without falling apart. They're buttery and have a good flavor from the sesame seeds. A perfect bun really.  The fries are pretty blah. I've had better many places. I like my fries crisp on the outside and soft in the middle and I feel like these lack a bit on the outside crispiness. The poutine is OK if you like mushrooms, though I've had better back home.  So if you're a Ramsay fan stop here and grab a Hell's Kitchen and shake!",

We both agreed that the buns were the best component as they were fluffy and had some good sesame seeds on top.   The truffle fries and aioli were the best things I've ever eaten. I would die for those fries.  The only negatives were the patties themselves as they were a tad underseasoned, but the ingredients and buns help with that.   Overall: if you like burgers and Gordon Ramsay, this place is worth the wait and the moderate pricing. However if the novelty of a celebrity chef isnt your shtick, you might not be too impressed",

There are so many flavors that were going on in my mouth, not a party but a riot! Mind blowing bbq flavor and after eating this density of a burger you will say yes to a light walk! Now let's not ask for the check before,....you guessed it finishing that great paired beer. Blue moon was the one with this one. An IPA too hoppie for a burger this dense. Burger was the pork burger wrapped in bacon (you already know my weakness) topped with pulled pork. The pork butcher deluxe is what I call it! Gordon, your welcome.   Keep it fresh and clean (hands that is) with a cut down the middle. Sit back take it in...1...2...3 NOW ask for the check and treat yourself to a walk on the strip maybe a little gamble dessert at the blackjack table followed by a nap.   Overall, you can't go wrong with this place just get in before dinner time 5pm because it gets crowded. Don't forget, TYS, always!!!",

What is NOT GOOD are the sauces that accompany the fries. Ew. So nasty I don't get why these are something Gordon gets behind. The yellow one is waxy and tastes like lemon. Gross. It also looks like pudding. The red one is not ketchup. They don't have regular ketchup. Bottom line, I don't want to spend $20+ on a burger if there aren't good fries to pair it with and good sauces.   I wish they amp up their game.",

There is also a sign with its instructions too if you did wait in line like me without reading the huge prints!! Lol the line is only lent for parties of 2 or less. When you request your reservation from the hostess, they ask for a contact number to send you a text when the table is ready for seating. Usually takes about 30 minutes wait time to get our table, so just stick around the area and/or do a little shopping.   I love the seating arrangements. There's quite a few bar areas and good lighting especially if you're next to the glass wall of fire .  Let's talk about their menu! It's like a British flag  that unfolds like an origami!! Lol jk more or less.   Now let me talk about the service! Gordon Ramsay trained their crew perfectly, cuz when you talk gourmet burger, my tastebuds felt gourmet expectations lol All the servers are very keen on our needs and all ways checked back on our table for feedback.   I purchased a Forest Burger = tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, duck bacon $15, Farm House Burger = dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg $15, and Sweet Potato Fries $8.   I'll end this review with a famous quote, \"why did the chicken cross the road? Because it was way too f@#%*ing undercooked!\" - Gordon Ramsay",

My son and I were here for a basketball tournament and wanted some place close to the hotel.  Yes it is a burger joint but it is definitely much better.  My son ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger which had aged provolone, dubliner and Boursin.  Which he proclaimed as the \"best burger\" ever in his young life.  I ordered the Forrest Burger which had tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon.  The burger didn't disappoint and was well worth it.  Yes, the burger is more expensive than a regular burger joint but the quality of ingredients and most important the taste of everything ordered was worth it.  FYI, everything is a la carte.  We ordered the Beer Battered Onion rings which were equally incredible.  The chesse coating topping the onion rings and the chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch sauce were great compliments to the rings.  The \"Just Fries\" which were good but I thought the contrast of the two different ketchups made it interesting as I have never had curry ketchup before.   Compliments to Chef Ramsay and his management team.  The staff was well trained, courteous, and on point. When our \"Just Fries\" came out cold, I mentioned it to Ashley our server and she returned in a flash with a set of fresh hot fries.  The restaurant is clean, with a bar and numerous TV's to watch games.  It is a little loud.  The menu has vegetarian options as well.  I mentioned this as my wife who wasn't with me would ask.  If you appreciate the taste of your food, eat here.  If your interested in the volume of food and not the taste, this isn't your restaurant. I definitely will be back on my next trek to Las Vegas.",

She told me the kitchen got behind and that they stopped seating people so they could catch up. Appeared to be very disorganized. Not something you would expect from Gordon Ramsey restaurants. Other then the long wait the food was absolutely delicious. The black garlic Caesar salad was the best I have ever tried. Definitely a must but be ready for the line and long wait times.",

So put your name on the list, then walk around Planet Hollywood to gamble, people watch on the strip, shop in Miracle Mile, or get a drink at their bar while you wait for your table.   It's kid friendly, casual, and not insanely priced. You still get a taste of \"Gordon Ramsay\" without breaking the bank. Everything is a-la-carte, so fries are extra. But one order of fries is enough for two people to share, and you can choose from several different types of fries, so it makes sense.   All of our food (and drinks) came out quick and hot. The hostess, server, food runners, and bussers worked well together making sure that all tables were taken care of in a timely manner. Out of the 4 of us, we all left full and happy!",

I had to cancel all my restaurants reservations and the trip to Grand Canyon because I needed to be near a restroom and I was not able to eat at all. Also we had to loose $ for a bike rent and a hotel next to Grand Canyon as we were not able to go. Very very very bad experience. Would not recommend this restaurant.

This time it's seems like all the customer service manners have gone out the window. 1st we got there and they sat us down in small half booth/ table. When we asked for a bigger booth, They said booths are for 4 or more people even though there were literally 2 booths that were not being use and there was no one else waiting. I even told the waitress that we would wait if it was necessary. Still we ended up in a small table for two. 2) I specifically told the waitress that we were going to share the burger. When the burger came out it was not cut. Then we asked the guy if they can cut the burger and said they couldn't. 3)Waitress pretty much ignored us until was time for the bill. \"Someone wants' a tip. Overall customer service sucks. There's no such thing as the customer is always right in this place. I don't think I'll be coming back here.",

There were four of us and we were able to snag a table immediately at 5pm. The staff here are great, very attentive and constantly refilling our drinks without us even having to ask :)  I had high expectations since this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger which comes with asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeno aioli. This was one of the best burgers I have ever had, I loved the spiciness of the roasted jalapenos and jalapeno aioli and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger itself was cooked medium well per my request, the meat was juicy, not overcooked and dry. There is a huge variety of burgers on the menu so if you are not a fan of spice, there are many other options. I also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries to share as a table. The fries were perfectly cooked and I loved the flavors. The burger is very filling so sharing the fries as a table was ideal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I plan on coming back on my next trip to Vegas. The prices are super reasonable for a high end burger created by Gordon Ramsay :)",

Parmesan truffle fries and farmhouse burger were perfectly prepared and DELICIOUS!!!!   You'll need to wait in a line to get in, but it moves rather quickly. Once seated and your order is placed, it does take about 40-45 mins to receive your food (which seems like forever when your hungry) but the results are worth the wait.",

We opted for the moderately priced Gorden Ramsay Burger, located inside Planet Hollywood and were seated faster than the given wait time (early weekday evening).  Ambience is definitely buzzing, and the establishment was smaller than expected.  Food was great, as stated by my group who had the Truffle Fries, Bleu Cheeseburger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, and their off-menu special, The F-word (in honor of G-Ram's new show).  Fries come thick-cut with 2 sauces, Hell's Kitchen was not as fiery as presumed, and the F-word was mouthwateringly delicious, with its dry-aged ribeye and short-ribs. I myself had the Tandoori Chicken burger, which was on the dry side and begging for more of the scrumptiously-described tahini & mint vinaigrettes. On the other hand, love the black & white sesame bun aesthetic.  Skip the jumbo onion rings.  Service was 3/5. Kept our waters filled but the food took a good while.  The experience was not as amazing as I expected, but I'd recommend stopping by for a good beef burger.",

I'm not sure if they have a restroom inside but if they did, his name would be on the toilet seats and a photo of the man himself, hands folded, would be taped to the back door of the stall, judging you. His name and photo are literally all over this place. I get it, it's Vegas, but I feel like if this was on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon would have a few wise cracks for the \"donkeys\" that chose the decor. THE FOOD: a tasty burger that won't blow your mind, but it's good. The flavors are there and they did not disappoint. Go if there's no line, it's convenient for you (staying in Planet Hollywood), you LOVE looking at photos of Gordon Ramsay, or are simply very very hungry for a decent burger.",

Food: Amaaazzing! I wasn't feeling to good, so I nibbled at everything, but everything I tasted was so yummy. We ordered a burger (forgot which one), ahi tuna sliders, hellfire chicken wings and a side of fries. Everything was delicious. The burger and wings especially! The ahi tuna wasn't anything special, but wasn't bad either.I was sad I wasn't feeling well, otherwise I would've enjoyed the experience much more and ordered more food to try.

I had the Forest Burger and the mister had something else, both of which we nodded along with since, you know, we were in the shadow of the great insult tosser.   Both my beer order and my burger order came out wrong, like, completely different items than what I ordered. Both were replaced but no offer was made to comp or do anything despite having to flag down and wait for them to fix both issues. I spent more on other meals in Vegas, but this was the only one that felt like too much for what came of it. Agree with other reviewers that the sides are not too hot either - given that our onion rings came out immediately, it was clear they keep them at the ready, fast food-style. Had always wanted to go in whenever we passed this spot, but happy to know now that I won't need to return. (Alternative recommendation: Holstein's.)",

To put things into perspective: I hate pickles. There were pickles in my burger and I loved it. Now that's saying something in my book.  We ordered the UK Burger and Hog Burger with Onion Rings and Truffle Fries. Everything came out tasting great. My buddy scarfed his UK Burger down in about 2 minutes. The Hog Burger was perfectly done. I actually added an egg per the servers suggestion, and it was an amazing choice.  Overall, the service and food were a solid 5 stars. The restaurant is clean and they do a fair job at getting people in and out quickly without making you feel rushed. This is definitely a must-try Burger restaurant.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped here after the Backstreet Boys show in Planet Hollywood. I was excited they offer an Impossible burger substitute for any burger on the menu. We had a short wait and had a friendly server from Moldova, I forget her name but she was friendliest server we had in Vegas (hard to find there) and very good. The cocktails were creative and tasty, we both enjoyed. The appetizer list was simple and since I'm vegetarian we were stuck ordering the creamy corn dip. It was tasty, just didn't have enough chips to finish it or something other than tortilla chips would be nice for dipping. Creative burger menu, hard to choose. My impossible burger with onion strings and gruyere cheese, I forget all toppings, was delicious. It really does taste like a real burger, I always have to second guess if it's actually meat they served me when I taste a good one. This one was cooked perfectly but I'd just say the toppings and sauces were lacking a little, not enough for the size of the burgers. The lack of sauce made it a little dry. The burger buns with seeds are soooo yummy! My boyfriend is a real burger guy and he's pretty critical about his favorite food :) He said his farm burger was good but not great, and overall his burger patty itself was on the dry side. He ordered medium rare but it came more on medium side. There was no dripping burger juice from his burger, from my days of consuming meat, I know this to be a good sign for a juicy burger. But his burger was not very juicy at all even though the flavors and quality of the meat were great. It could have used a sauce or tomato to help make up for the lack of juice. I saw other reviewers comment on dry burgers and now I see why. It was still tasty just not what expected from Gordon Ramsay establishment. We loved the truffle fries and aioli, the sweet potato fries were good but the dip was just ok. The restaurant is not over the top touristy as expected, it is tastefully done. This is a good spot for after show or late night food and yummy cocktails.",

    "text": "I am not ready to put Ramsay Burger on my list of 'Best Burgers I Have Ever Had'. Partly because, despite what my size might suggest, I have eaten a great many burgers in my life (I am from the Midwest, after all). But do trust me when I say that the quality of the food, as well as the price you will pay, will both leave you somewhat floored.  My company and I somewhat reluctantly came to Ramsay Burger after being too negligent to make a timely reservation at Hell's Kitchen. Oh well! The wait at Ramsay Burger for 3 folks on a Saturday night proved to be... well, not nearly as bad as I imagined. Right around 45 minutes in all. I have a feeling that it would have been shorter if it had been just the two of us, but thankfully we were in Vegas so... there was plenty to do while we waited!  The setting for the restaurant is nothing remarkable. The menu is simple and straightforward, as you would expect. There are a few starters, a couple of salads, beef burgers, a chicken burger, a vegetarian option utilizing mushrooms, and a couple of dishes that incorporate hot dogs. I initially tried to order the bangers and mash, but my server waved it off as, and I do quote, 'disgusting'. Crisis averted. I ordered the curry chicken burger instead. And I was glad that I did!  The burgers here are good, as I mentioned. Really nothing earth-shaking. But the prices are not bad at all, considering the name and the venue, and the accompanying pieces make the experience worth the while. Particularly, the truffle fries were incredible, but the real gem that we found, was the poutine. The gravy, the burnt tips, everything was absolutely incredible. I seriously cannot overstate how good this was. I am considering coming back just to try these amazing fries again. That being said, the starters and side dishes are a bit on the pricey side (which comes as no surprise), but in my opinion, the poutine at the very least is well worth the expense.  Finally, there is a wonderful assortment of craft beer on draft. Can't speak to the availability of cocktails too much. Not really my scene.  In closing, believe the hype! This is definitely one of my favorite spots in Vegas for a reasonably priced bite. Don't come in expecting the world and you won't leave disappointed. But do make it a point to try that poutine!",

I did manage to take one bite of the burger my husband ordered, but that's all I could muster.  I must say, for that one bite, it was OUTSTANDING.  The beef literally melted on my tongue, and it was easy to tell it was very high quality.  The flavors were excellent, and while there was more waiting for me to eat, I just couldn't.  Everyone else devoured their burgers and 2 types of fries that were ordered (plain and truffle fries).  Oh, if only I was feeling better........ but for that one bite, yeh, I am reporting excellence on that.  Gordon Ramsey Burger is located in a very heavily smoke-filled Planet Hollywood, so if you are sensitive to smoke, beware.  Please also note that the wait-time can be quite long.... no matter what time you go !!  They do not accept reservations.",

I would say it's not worth the wait but if there is no wait then it's a pretty good burger spot.  The hell fire wings were not spicy. It had a sweetness that I rather it didn't have. It also didn't come with any dipping sauce. I had to ask and was told they don't have blue cheese. They did have ranch but it's just not the same. I was happy to see that the wings were partially deboned.  I got the farmhouse burger. It comes with bacon and an egg. It was really good but the burger came dry, no sauces. I had to ask for mayo. It also doesn't come with fries so I ordered the truffle fries. I don't like the fact it was the thick steak fries. I wish it was cut thinner however the truffle aioli that it came with was ridiculously good.  They also had a lot of unique burgers but I was not feeling adventurous that day. Great burger spot if you don't have to wait. Otherwise it's not worth the wait.",

Their French fries and onion rings are super large so I suggest couples to order one and share unless you can finish it all. The atmosphere is upbeat. They have an open kitchen so you can see the cooks in action while the servers constantly deliver the plates out. Out waitress was attentive and kept checking on us. The price was definitely more expensive than most burger joints but the food and service made up for me and I can recommend this place to the people who enjoy high quality delicious burger served by attentive food service people.",

The intense flavors you get out of a burger is a special kind of flavor that I don't think I have ever had before. I recommend this burger joint to you if you are in Las Vegas as a visitor and are looking for a good place to have lunch or dinner because trust me, you're never gonna find a burger place better then this ANYWHERE else but Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I came here on vacation and ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, Forest Burger, and just fries. The Hell's Kitchen burger packed so much flavor it was unbelievable, the peppers and the burger itself was amazing, 100% incredible and worth it. The forest burger was a perfect balance of subtle flavors, the buttery arugula and mushrooms blended so well with the duck bacon.   The only complaint I had was the fries... I was really hoping for the classic \"piping hot\" crispy French fries but they must have been left out too long because they were tough almost rubbery like jerky. The two ketchups however, had the most delicious flavors I've ever tasted, I would have just ate them on their own.  *If you're trying many burgers I recommend ending with the Hell's Kitchen burger, it packs such a flavorful punch and might takeaway from the other subtle flavors for the other burgers.   With the exception of the fries, I've never had burgers with such amazing flavors. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "Very incompetent hostess/ girls working at the front. We checked in at 12:11 and they told us the wait is 25 minutes, which means that we should have a table at 12:36. At 12:20, we see people going in as priority since they have diamond/platinum. Since I had platinum, I went back and told them that I have the platinum rewards priority card as well. They seemed nice and told me that I would be next. 20 long dreadful moments go by as my family and I see two parties of 5 walk in right before us. Before that, 5 or 6 full waves of people in line proceeding in before us. Frustrated, I asked the hostess for a status on our place in line. I was assured I was next (once again). We decided to wait and 5 minutes go by and we see another party of 5 go in right before our eyes. This was the straw that broke the camels back and we decided to ask the hostess. At 12:50, we told them that they can take us off the waitlist and they shrugged with attitude and said \"ok.\" Very unprofessional, did not even offer any apologies for the delay. My family and I were shocked about the fact that the workers didn't even care about our business. Was a huge fan of this restaurant whenever I came to Vegas. This restaurant really needs to start training their hostesses to provide better customer service. We would like being treated like people and not another number or group trying to go into the restaurant.",

First of all we waited 45 min for the food, not including 20 minutes waiting in line to get seated.  My waiter Wendy was showing attitude. I ordered Hog burger and asked our waiter Wendy if I can get no bread but letters wrapped, and she said, \"I don't know, but I will ask.\" She never let me know whether they can or not. Then she was tripping with my son, who leaned on the table, and she was warning him that this is glass. Come on, I know that my son is too alert. And finally she was not behaving professionally since she was flirting with another waiter, they were literally hugging; she let him hug her around her waist. Do whatever you want, I do not care, but not in front of your customers. She never gave nor asked if we need the receipt. I mean she gave us a check, but we got no copy of it nor we were asked if we need one BUT the HOG burger was DEVINE, it upgrades the whole negative experience to 4 stars. I still recall the burger with my mouth watering. The patty is about 1 inch thick and wrapped in bacon and cooked this way, and topped with some kind of pulled slow cooked meat. So tender and juicy, I cannot ever describe it. It wins your heart immediately.This is the best food I have ever tasted in my life. And I wish I could experience the same with the customer service because  I pay to experience amazing food with great service.",

The burger did not take too long to come. Service was decent.   We got the Hell's Kitchen and lobster/shrimp burgers. I enjoyed the lobster/shrimp burger a lot. The burger patty was very flavorful and you can taste the shrimp and lobster. The patty texture was very good too - doesn't fall apart and not mushy with a slightly chewy texture. The pickled carrots in the burger was nice and crunchy and added the needed acid to the burger. The buns were light and didn't feel too heavy.   I thought the burger was gonna be my caloric heavy weight but man the Oreo creme brulee shake stole the title! It's super decadent and delicious but probably 800+calories! Definitely would order it again if we ever go back and workout like crazy to burn it off!   Glad we try this place!",

The only flavor was from the one big jalapeno you bit into and that was just burning your mouth. I usually love spicy and hot foods. The onion rings were decent because I liked the spicy ketchup, but the Cheddar Ale soup was yuck! Way too much chive.  The wine menu was awful and was all cheap bottom shelf stuff you get from Costco. I like trying new wines and champagne when I'm out - especially Vegas, so that also was disappointing. Definitely don't stand in line for this place. It's just hyped up because of the name behind it.",

The texture of the fries was off and seemed to be tougher as if they're had been reheated. I loved the ketchup flavors that the brought with the fries though. As far as I am concerned the place is more touristy.",

We had the burnt ends poutine and wings to start, then split the hog burger. The poutine was amazing, the meat was tender and the gravy was rich and delicious! The wings were huge and had a great spicy/tangy flavor. The hog burger was massive and did not disappoint!",

Anyway, I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was cooked very well. Each bite gave me goosebumps. We also ordered a side of truffle fries which was seasoned perfectly.   The customer service was top notch. Our waitress did a great job keeping our party of 10 happy. With Ramsay as their boss, who can dare to mess up? This place gets a thumbs up in my book!",

    "text": "Of course we had to come here to get something after seeing Gordon Ramsay killing the game on tv. I was trying to set realistic expectations for this place but it's really hard with a chef of this caliber in its name. For me, the burger was only alright. We got the forest burger and it was just too fancy for us. I guess sometimes simple is better, and this is definitely the case. The buns were really good and didn't look or taste like it came from a bag. The meat was well seasoned and cooked medium just like the way we liked it. Somehow the meat wasn't very juicy though. I wonder what the ratio of fat is in their patty...The part that threw me off was the cheese. In my opinion, the tremor cheese just doesn't go well with the burger. It tasted like goat cheese and I felt like it overpowered the burger. I was really surprised about the arugula though. It wasn't too bitter and actually went well with the burger. However, I still feel like normal green leaf lettuce would've been better. But I did really like the mushrooms which gave it a different change of texture. We also got the truffle fries and it was phenomenal. The truffle and cheese gave it a unique, creamy flavor that tasted best with the normal ketchup. Service here was great and our server was very attentive. To justify the price for just a burger I expected this to blow my mind away. This didn't happen today. If it wasn't for how good the fries were, I would've given this place 3 stars. I hope I just got the wrong burger and the others are actually very good. Probably wont be back for a second chance though.",

The crunchiness and buttery bun was delicious from every bite. The flavor of the burger meat was cooked perfectly!! We'll definitely go back to try other burgers!

The order took about an hour (which was totally Ok and they prepared me for). However... when a person spends $18 on a burger (without any sides), they expect it to have some good flavor and at LEAST be hot! I was waiting for the burger at the nearby Extra Bar and as soon as I received the text notice, I made the 30 second walk to go pick it up. When I sat down to eat it (30 seconds later) I was sadly disappointed by it's lack of flavor and the fact that it MIGHT have been luke warm(ok, nope... totally cold). I tried to convince myself that it was better than it was (since it was a little $$$), but in the end... lesson learned... In-n-out burger tops Gordon Ramsey burger any day of the week",

Even the truffle fries priced at $12 is not bad especially if you share with one other person.   The only con is see is because of the wait time- but for me that doesn't warrant losing a star. If you plan accordingly and go off peak times, you should be okay.  I do not believe they have a reservation list. I came on a Monday at approx 6:30pm with my parents, we waited about 15 mins for a table (or could have been seated right away at the bar high tables). But when we came out a while later, there was a line all the way to the gaming tables- yes still on a Monday night. I've gone on a Saturday during peak time before and have waited almost 2 and a half hours for a table for 4. So don't do it and let it spoil everything.  The service was great, and the burgers are not monstrous. You will feel full and satisfied but not bloated, even with the fries. I recommend that everyone try this place.",

We also got the hells burger and hot dog.  They were both super delicious.  The hot dog was just a little to smokey for me, but that was my only complaint.  We also ordered the plain fries that came with a curry and chipotle ketchup.  The fries were just ok, I dont think it is worth $9.  The curry ketchup was a fail.  But over all I will be back when im in Vegas and ive been telling everyone I know to go.",

But i was so dosappinted, we ordered a hell's kitchen burger ,hog burger and truffle fries. And i asked the jalapeno on the side for my hell's kitchen burger. The fries had came first and it not crispy enough and sauce tasted very light. Then burger came i noticed there was only one set of silverware on our table. Meanwhile the buser dropped plates and cups while cleaning the table. The burger was over charred and i noticed i didnt see my jalapeno on the side after my first bit , guess where was it? yep it was inside my burger! so i just moved on the side. My server came and asked how everything i said its spicy and i thought its on the side then he just ignore what I said and walk away. Well i dont usually complain, but for the famous restaurant like that i expected more. We all know Gordon is a high standard person and thats why he is famous and successful. We expected his restaurants are same high standard. For people who want to have a nice burger i suggest you go in and out.",

The price of the burgers at nearly $20 without any sides isn't worth making multiple trips here but, it was fun to say we tried it and visited one of Gordon Ramseys restaurants. The meat itself was delicious and cooked to perfection! I just can't justify spending nearly $100 with tip for three burgers, one order of french fries and onion rings. The onion rings were the best I've ever had! As much as I wanted to try a refreshing alcoholic beverage being on budget I couldn't do it but, I would love to return for some onion rings and a cocktail! Very loud busy environment but, fun to try with the family. I followed the tips here on Yelp and it did help to not get confused and wait in line as this is only for parties of two.",

This wasn't a big deal for me, as I was staying at the hotel that this restaurant is inside of. They do let you leave and just text you when your food is ready, so that's a bonus.  Our food was done in about 35 minutes, which is exactly how long they told us it would be.  I got the Backyard Burger with no cheese and the vegan impossible patty. I LOVED this burger. This was my first time trying the impossible burger and I really enjoyed it. Even though I got one of the more basic burgers on the menu, everything tasted great and fresh. That being said, I do think they're asking a lot of their customers to pay $6 extra for the vegan patty. My friend got the Blue Cheeseburger and really enjoyed it. We also got an order of the \"just fries\" to share (the burgers do not come with any). The fries were okay, but i've had better. At $8 an order, I'd probably say skip the fries if you're planning on just getting the plain ones. All in all, this was a great meal and I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but just know what you're getting into. It is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and his name can carry a hefty price tag. The wait can be extremely long and they don't take reservations. But if you're okay with all of that, the food is great, and it was worth it for a nice special meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "The hype is real folks, this place is awesome!!! Came here for dinner to fulfill my longtime desire to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Add burgers to the mix and bam, paradise!  First off, the wait is a little disheartening. For a group of two, you wait in a line next to the hostess' booth until a table opens up. There were about 20 people and the wait was about 45 minutes long when I was there, but continued to grow and grow as the night went on. It sucks, but it's Vegas. Just suck it up!  After we were seated, I ordered the blue (yeah, not bleu) cheeseburger and a side of parmesan truffle fries. After about a 20 minute wait, it came out and it was phenomenal. The burger wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, but it was damn good!!! Definitely a top contender. It was very well put together, it wasn't sloppy, it was perfectly cooked, and a great great burger. Perfectly moist. So good. Next, the fries. Holy cow, the fries were freakin' amazing. The fries were the best I've ever eaten. Simply perfection!  Very good restaurant. A few cons, but the pros greatly outweigh them. I would come back over and over again!",

The burger was cooked to a medium. The flavor was all there and everything inside the burger was A+. Truffle fries were bomb! The ketchup was amazing, I don't know how to describe it but I couldn't get enough. My brother who doesn't like ketchup actually wanted to finish the sauce. The Dijon mustard was suburb! Lastly the salad was light and filling. It was a great way to start the meal.   Service: Our waiter was hilarious! He informed us of all the specials and joked around with how we reacted to the food. He could see that we thought the food was delicious. I don't think there was a point where he did not check up on us. Keep up the great work staff!   Ambiance: I love the British theme. All the posters and color design are pleasing. The dragon with the fire up front was great to look at. The tables and seats were comfortable. I like how you can look into the kitchen and see the chefs cooking.   Overall a wonderful experience!",

Must be fans of the show that come here because the food just isn't amazing enough to justify standing in line over 30 min.  The fish sandwich was bland.  It didn't have anything to give it Pop!  I wish there was a spicy tartar with lemon on it. The Ribeye Special burger I had was ruined by the shredded beef that was all over the burger.  Ribeye burger is by itself supposed to be more than enough.  I just didn't like it.  The best part of the meal was the truffle fries.  If you come and eat here, those are a must!!!  If I ever return, it will be for those yummy fries.",

Sub-par service.   +Crown Burger: My boyfriend ordered this and it was delicious, something about the dried tomatoes complimented the burger very well. +Blue Cheeseburger: I got this because I love blue cheese. I asked for the spicy mayo on the side because I didn't want it to be too saucy or spicy. This burger was not as good as the crown burger because it tasted so buttery and heavy. It was cooked perfectly and once I removed some of the cheese, the buttery-ness subsided, which was good.  +Onion Rings: Best onion rings ever! So glad we got these instead of the truffle fries. The breading was perfectly seasoned and crispy and the ranch and chipotle ketchup were amazing.   -The server disappeared after we got our food and we weren't able to flag her down to get the check for around 20-30 minutes. She tended to the tables around us but never came back for us. The bussers were extremely helpful though.  I would definitely come back but not if I'm in a rush to be anywhere.",

I feel like those are a premium just for the Gordon Ramsay name. I had been here once before and thought similarly, but decided to give it a second chance since some friends wanted to go. Nope, that just cemented my opinion to never go again.   But anyways, getting onto the food. For the name alone there's a certain level of expectation, but the food does not impress. Rather than sticking with a more classic burger like the first time, I figured that maybe if I go for a more high end burger then the quality of this place might be able to shine. Big mistake. I ordered the $26 lobster and shrimp burger and if anything it just disappointed me more. The shrimp and lobster flavors were both very muted, it could've been some other type of seafood patty and I wouldn't have been able to tell. Also a little on the dry side. Will have to try another one of his establishments to find something that can live up to the Gordon Ramsay name.",

We were first skeptical of this place since most gourmet burgers are typically good but how much better can you get by going to this place? TONS!  This place is definitely a must visit... It's a Gordon Ramsey for God's sake.  For starters, the onion rings have a great crisp and flavor.  It is served with home made ketchup and their home made ranch.  They also have a french fry with a curry dip... Delicious!   If you are hesitant on  burger choices, I recommend the Hog burger . Patty made out of beef Chuck, brisket and bacon which is then wrapped in bacon and topped with bacon, BBQ pulled pork, coleslaw, pickles and fried onions!  AMAZING!!!  They also have great shakes and an amazing chocolate dessert as Gordon Ramsey would do.   You definitely have to make it out....SO GOOD!",

It is usually about a 40 minute wait but you can venture off and do other things while you wait because you leave your phone number and they will text you when your table is almost ready. It's about $17 a burger and it's relatively cheap for how great the burger tastes. Food is prepared so that you can have enough time to casually talk while waiting for your meal. There is free parking at the Miracle Mile shops making it easy to come here if you wanted to. It's also right by the Las Vegas Blvd Planet Hollywood entrance giving you more easy access from the Strip.",

However, our service was nothing but a disappointment. The server forgot our drinks. Once she brought them she spilled them all over the table and me. Broke a glass on us. Our food was served super late. No one came to really apologize us about the whole awful experience.  The food was alright. The beef was not even juicy to think that i got a steak in between my buns.   Would I come back? Not really unless a friend visiting wants to try it",

Right when I got into the taxi, I called the restaurant and asked if I can place an order for pick-up. She said \"no, you have to come in and order.\" When we arrived, we went straight to the restaurant to place the order.   However, the hostess said that I cannot place and order. I had explained that I called 15 minutes ago and was informed that I could. The hostess continue to say that I can only place the order for take-out before 5pm.   This was super frustrating! We were starving. So, we dropped off our stuff and ran down to wait in line for a sit-down meal. We waited in line for 30 minutes and ordered dinner around 11pm. We waited about 30 minutes for our burgers.   We ordered truffle fries, forest burger and blue cheeseburger. Everything was tasty except the forest burger. The forest burger is bland.   After the meal, I'm still annoyed about being misinformed.",

We ordered: Farmhouse burger: bacon and patty a bit dry lobster&shrimp burger:  delicious!!!  The best of all we ordered.   backyard burger: dry onion rings: good but nothing to rave about and hellsfire wings:  dry and soggy.  Should have skipped it.

We ordered the tuna sliders, parm fries and the bangers and mash. Fries were ok, but a little dry, not made to order. Dipping sauces were the star there. The garlic aioli was fantastic.  The tuna sliders were good, lacked the burst of flavor I think we were hoping and expecting it would have. Bangers and mash was pretty decent, the little potato balls were awesome, the roll the sausages were on were fresh and delicious. I can't complain overall, however - devils always in the details.  That being said the curry dipping sauce I requested on the side had been sitting in the fridge and I had to stir it up a little to be able to dip anything in it.  When you're paying $25-30 for a burger and fries..... I expect little things like that to be right.  It just sort of misses the mark for me.  I've been here before and said the same thing.... I only came back because my sister had never tried the place and wanted to go.  I can't really say that I'll be back.  The novelty is in the name, certainly not the dishes.",

We all ordered different items and had great service.

One busboy saw me see the cockroach, stepped on it, looked back at me with an \"oh $hit\" look on his face and scooted the cockroach from where he stepped on it towards the kitchen . Yes, the kitchen!! We never spoke to a manager because we were completely grossed out. The food was excellent but the bug issue totally turned us off. Call an exterminator,  Gordon!",

Tons of greens, but they were balanced by all of the other vegetables and the delicoius grains in the salad. So I guess I\"m saying, it's a very large salad. And it was sooooo good!!! We also had the Hummus and Pitas. Yum!   My husband was in the mood for a salad and so was I. When I suggested we go to Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant, my husband was like, \"For a salad?!\" But he humored me.   After we finished eating, he said that his salad (we both had the same salad) was superb. He really thought a salad at a restaurant that specializes in burgers would be lacking. But he was happliy surprised to find that his salad was really good.  The only downside to this restaurant - and it's a big downside - is that they don't take reservations. So you either have to go very early and wait by the fire sign (not ideal with the Vegas heat), or eat at a time that most people won't be lined up, or just wait as long as it takes. The line was fairly short when we arrived at about 5:30pm on a Saturday night. But it still would have taken about 35 minutes to just be seated and we had a show to catch.   I asked if they could do a takeout order for us instead and they did. That saved us! It was super delicious and I'd eat here again for sure!   The staff were friendly and very helpful. Thanks for an awesome dinner!",

After the long delay, they got two of the orders wrong, even though nobody ordered anything special. By the time they brought the re-do orders, everyone else had cold food. One of the re-do orders was still wrong. All of this took more than two hours and nothing was above average. Except perhaps the shakes. Those were tasty. The waiter never apologized which seemed tacky and just kept saying it was too loud to hear anything.",

We tried Tandoori Chicken Burger and Lobster & shrimp burger. Lobster & Shrimp which is a specialty burger which is worth 25$ too pricey but worth the penny. They don't serve any fries with the burger. I tried onion rings they were a bit salty. The tandoori burger was good they made the filling paneer or tofu, cucumber, and some lettuce. Pretty good place to try on the strip.",

We received our hummus which was very good and then she came to sit with us again and take our order.  When my wife ordered Med Rare she asked if she's good with red? She said yes and then I ordered and I said would like M R also. They brought out the burgers and truffle fries which were good but underwhelming.  I then took a bite and realized my burger was not just well done but well well done. I asked my wife about hers and she showed me her well done burger. I was in shock since we watch every show that Gordon does and couldn't believe they couldn't get the cook right. Our waitress or I should say order taker took them back to the kitchen. We tried not to eat the fries but figured they would only get cold. The manager brought our burgers back, set them down and asked us to cut into them to make sure they were right. He didn't apologize or say anything about the error and it felt like we were being unreasonable to ask that it be cooked properly. Then he started small talk \"what brought you here\" etc and said he is the manager if we needed anything. The whole situation was very strange. The burgers were the best burgers we've ever had but would not go back there for all the other nonsense. Thought maybe they would comp a drink or something but should have figured.  We went to Gordon Ramsay Steak and had the best food and service you can imagine.",

This time was just so bad! First of all, after waiting in line for thirty minutes (understandable in the past) we were seated. Then it was no less then 15 minutes before a server came to our table. After we placed our order it took 40 minutes to get our food and even then the order was wrong. I asked to speak to the manager and instead of taking responsibility, which he should have (since these are management issues), he walked away saying he wanted to talk to the server. She returned with a check which instead of comping our meal or at the very least removing the entree that was wrong, he had the waitress remove the automatic 20% gratuity. Just so bad. If Gordon Ramsey new what was going on, heads would roll. We tipped the waitress anyway and left a tip for the manager (a note about what an ahole he was!\"",

I loved the restaurant setting and placement, it felt very chic and we'll put together but that's about it. I hope you have a better experience",

The masses dictate the survival or death of an establishment with their thumbs, like back during the Roman days of the coliseum. One key to unlock the success of a restaurant is to appeal to the majority and even offer a selection that simply can change ones mind about a dish or entree. Gordon Ramsey's Burger has done that. I hate onion rings. I've never been attracted to the concept of wasting batter on an ingredient that's used as a topping or for just flavor. I absolutely love these onion rings! They are by far the showcase menu item to me because the level of excellence it presents overshadows the delicious and decadent selections of burgers that the famous F-you chef's menu offers. Cheers to you sir!",

And we like to try different burger joint every time we're in town. So this time around we decided to try \" GORDON RAMSAY BURGER \" located in planet Hollywood.   We got there, got seated right away. Atmosphere was just an ordinary topical restaurant nothing fancy or anything. Only eye appealing was the fire place, which made it more formal.  We ordered ~  Truffle fries - thick cut, not much flavor, came out kinda cold. Not a fan :/  My husband got the Hells Kitchen Burger W/ Bacon - he rather have 5 guys burger all day long  I got me the ultimate Burger-  lack flavor and meat was dry even when I ordered it Med rare   Over all I was expecting more from this burger joint sense it is Gordon Ramsay. But there was no party or firework in our mouth. Wasn't satisfied and not worth $70. Like my husband said 5 guys are better and it's half the price.  Sorry Gordon Ramsay but you're burger and fires need re-vamping. Ney :/",

    "text": "Gordon's Ramsay burger is a great burger at Vegas prices. When you trying to live big but not too big this place is worth the try. Sometimes your just down for a burger even if we are all \"idiot sandwiches.\" Without the need to cook it ourselves.   Ambiance wise this place is casual, it's Vegas fancy but no need for coat service here. Just rock and roll in your bro tank or your party dress. It's somewhat loud but what do you expect it's Vegas. You can keep a decent conversation with your buddies as long as they're only 3 feet away.   Service here is good. It's not mind blowing but these people are busy. You get the menu take a few scans and pick what you want. Our server recommended some pretty good beers to go with our burgers so kudos on being a step up.   Now let's get to the meat and buns oh and the spuds! We got the the poutine appetizer, pleasing to the eye and even more to the taste buds. The gravy was delicious the fries crunchy yet soft and the meat oh so tender. Sad face no huge cheese curds so those from the cold north might be a bit turned off. We opted for the foie gras burger and the forest burger.  The foie gras burger had a perfect medium rare and with a nice little creaminess from the foie. It was also slightly citrusy which was great for all the richness.  The forest burger with its duck bacon and tremor cheese(goat cheese) was a barn door classic. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but after a few bites I was really enjoying the burger. The burgers here are medium sized. This ain't a whatburger and it's about quality vs quantity. Oh yah the truffle fries. The fries themselves were good but the homemade ketchup and the truffle aioli are the cherry on top of the French fry pie.   Overall this place is a great experience. It's a taste of Ramsay without the fuss of the higher up places. Enjoy a bite a beer and create some great memories. Take some pics and enjoy these burgers they are more than \"adequate\"",

I had farmhouse burger and truffle oil fries. Keep in mind that it takes about 20 to 30 mins for your burger.  They dont tell you this. I overheard next table complaining about the long wait and only then the server \"reminded\" them. We were not in a rush so didnt mind the wait but would not recommend if you're on the clock for this reason.  The same server carried some of that frustration with her when she took our order which was noticeable though i think she did try to brush off.  As far as cooking the burger pattie to your order i.e. medium in my case that was done well.   Though i did enioy the unique combo of truffle oil on my fries i could tell that it was just sprayed over on the top portion of the fries as once you work your way through it was just regular fries nothing special.  The portion was generous though.  Overall i just felt that it was all about the celebrity chef hype that did not really live up to anything spectacular.",

While they don't take reservations, if you get there early enough, the line is maybe a 10-15 minute wait. This is absolutely one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. I don't think you can go wrong with any burger at this place but I've got to recognize the Ultimate Cheeseburger, which is my go to item. The buns are quality, the burger is juicy and flavorful, and it has three kinds of cheeses mixed together in what can only be described as my version of heaven. My husband had the Lobster/Shrimp burger which has a shrimp/lobster type patty and pickled veggies on it. It's really a different option then the traditional burgers.   Lastly, you need to get one of their milkshakes. We didn't last time we were there so we made a point to try the Oreo Creme Brulee Shake on this trip. It is so rich and the flavor is better then just your average oreo shake because of the creme brulee pudding on the top. The cocktails we had were also on point. I don't remember what they were called but the white sangria I ordered was our favorite because it had this really nice cinnamon after taste. Do not miss this restaurant!",

They don't taste super awesome (I understand it's just a burger), it's mostly the condiments that make the burgers taste ok.   Fries ! Mistake mistake MISTAKE. Regular fries & truffle fries suck huge monkey balls. Ever been to fat burger and gotten fat fries? They're cooked all the way through right? Here, no one's fries were cooked all the way. They \"looked\" pretty but tasted super bland, yes even the truffle ones.   I paid 8 dollars for a popsicle. The creme fraiche tasted ok. But like come on, I didn't pay 8 bucks for a tiny lick of creme fraiche bro bro.   We had a party of 15. Again, our service was fam-fucking-tastic. But this place is all hype and no substance. I tried a bite of wings, bite of hot dog and if I could give this place zero stars (based on their food, I would)  Go to Morton's steakhouse and get their prime burger for the same price.

    "text": "After watching a concert at Planet Hollywood, I was starving! When we saw Gordon Ramsay Burger had no line, my friend and I decided to grab dinner here. We walked in on Wednesday, May 10th around 11:30pm. We were seated immediately at their counter with a view of the kitchen. A friend joined us later and we were able to grab an extra seat.  *Beer Battered Onion Rings: parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip ($9) *Hell's Kitchen Burger: asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno pesto aioli ($15) *Ultimate Cheeseburger: aged provelone, dublinar, boursin ($15) *\"Foie\" Burger: pate foie gras, chevre, port wine aioli, frisee ($21) *Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) *Just Fries ($8) *Black Butte ($9) *Coors Light Draft ($8) 2 *Guinness Draft ($8)  I got the foie burger with truffle fries. I should have read the description closer as I thought it was going to come with seared foie. Instead, it was a foie pate. It probably would have been fine, but paired with the chevre, the burger was too rich. And not in a good way as the chevre added a tanginess I didn't like. It also seemed like the cheese and foie were fighting each other instead of complementing each other. I did enjoy the truffle fries, but I think it's hard to mess those up. We'd been drinking all day, so I just decided to get a couple Coors Light. It was easy to drink. The boys got the rest of the food and thought everything was okay. Not worth the price was the consensus.  I don't mind paying more for a good burger, but these are just okay.",

    "text": "Best burger I have ever had in my life, period! As a die-hard In-N-Out fan, I used to view Burger as a fast and convenient eat. After trying Gordon Ramsay Burgers, it totally changed the way how I used to perceive Burgers, I had never thought Burgers could be this delicious. I was totally awed by their creativity in combining so many different ingredients to make each burger so unique and delicious. This is not only making a burger, but this is also making an art!   During my stay in Vegas, I had the opportunities to try the following:  1. Farmhouse Burger(Rating 5/5)-The bun which grilled over the apple wood has a slight sweet taste to it and combines so well with beef, cheese,duck bacon and egg. This is a very traditional style burger can be served in many places, but the way Gordon Ramsay does it and the ingredients used making it THE BEST!  2. Lobster and Shrimp Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pickled vegetables, aioli combined with the lobster and shrimp patty was incredible. You get the taste of the sweetness and sourness of the pickle vegetables and the ocean taste of the shrimp and lobster all in one bite. The only downside is that the shrimp flavor overshadowed the lobster.  3. Hog Burger(Rating 4.5/5)-The pork patty combined with bacon tasted very juicy, tender and crunchy at the same time and the pickled cucumbers gives a slightly sour taste. Very very good.  4. Just Fries(Rating 5/5)-The potatoes they used were so fresh, clearly hand cut, not frozen and were fried perfectly. It comes with two different sauces: traditional tomato sauce and the spicy tomato sauce, both you can tell easily are home made and both taste are OUT OF THIS WORLD when you dip in the fries. I have never had any fries this delicious before.  The price is significantly steeper than a fast food chain like In-N-Out or Shake Shack, but I believe the quality and the taste made it worth every penny.   I sincerely wish Gordon Ramsay Burger can be opened in LA one day. I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again.",

Fortunately, Gordon Ramsay Burger takes down your phone number and you will receive a text to make your way back to the restaurant. Since it's located in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mall, you can shop while waiting to be called. Once you get the text, your entire party has to present itself and you will have to wait in a line at the front of the restaurant for a bit.  --  taste / 5 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 5 service / 4 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 4.4",

I started to get less and less interested in watching reality TV but that never stopped me from trying one of his Vegas restaurants. I know Hells Kitchen just opened at Caesar's Palace but I was dying to try Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood. I was on a budget so I strictly ordered the classic Gordon Ramsay Burger with fries and just a glass of water.   Whenever I passed by the restaurant, the line was almost out the door. Thank, God I only had to wait 10 minutes and with the bar having open seating. I quickly stay down right away when there was an open spot. I didn't bother ordering anything else but the Gordon Ramsay Burger. Honesty, it wasn't excellent or below expectations. Maybe because I'm use to having gourmet burgers so it's hard to tell the difference. Let's just say the burger was cooked just right, juicy and tender. I'd comeback here to try other items on the menu. Now I can finally cross off the Gordon Ramsay Burger off my Vegas list.",

While the service was excellent, from the hostess to our server, it is challenging to pay that much for the burgers. My brother and father both had the Backyard Burger which were good, but nothing special. Thick like an Applebee's cheesburger. Both said that a portion of their burger was salty. This may be because each patty is handmade. My mother had the Portobella Burger which she liked, particularly the mushroom, but again, there was saltiness to her burger. I enjoyed the Blue Cheeseburger. The flavors were good, specially the combination of cheese with fig jam. We ordered one Pepsi and one order of Parmesan Fries. But I cannot justify dropping around $100 for four burgers. Again, the food was unique, but average.",

The burgers were pretty good, the poutine was odd and the corn appetizer also seemed disorganized.  My main complaint is that when the runner delivered our entrees she literally pushed the dirty appetizer plates out of the way and left them there. The manager was patrolling  the dining room and never did a thing about it even though he stood beside our table at least 3 times.  Our service was nice and mostly attentive except when our entrees came we didn't see him for about 10 minutes and 2 of our drinks were empty.  It's a basic of good service to clear dirty plates ASAP from the table and ours literally sat there the entirety of our meal.  Maybe have a refresher on the basics even though this is a burger place as our bill for 3 was over $140.",

We were seated within 10 minutes and a waiter came to take our order shortly after. We decided to share a burger and couldn't decide between the farmers or the Hell's Kitchen burger so the waiter told us to try the Hell's Kitchen burger and add an egg for $3. We also ordered a cheddar ale soup. The servers seemed to be gossiping amongst themselves the whole time; we were seated near the kitchen area so we could see & hear everything such as which tables sent their food back & which tables were complaining, etc because the servers were talking pretty loudly. Also, our food took forever to come out; I think we waited for at least half an hour for our one burger to arrive at the table. By the time it arrived, we were so hungry that we didn't even notice that they had forgotten our egg until we were almost done with the burger. We informed our server & he looked at our food and asked if we wanted to get the egg now -- obviously we didn't because we only had a few bites of burger left -____- the cheddar ale soup was good but a little too salty. The burger itself was pretty good, but the overall experience and wait was blahhh.",

This place won't disappoint you with its good service, clean environment and amazing food.",

Walking in, the restaurant reminds you on multiple level that it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant (maybe to hypnotize your taste buds).   As most, this place was on our bucket list but we were half prepared that it was mostly hype. And, we were right.  Granted the meat, condiments and buns (wish it was warm but more on the cold side) were fresh. Although the burger we wanted was suppose to be medium rare, it could've use another minute on the grill.  Be forewarn that their foie gras burger is actually a \"SPREAD\", not a foie gras patty. Knowing this we still gave it a shot. Knowing it's a spread we still couldn't taste the foie gras, perhaps because the bleu cheese was too over powering. If there was a must try burger, go for the Anniversary Burger (it's not on their menu) and their Seafood burger.   As for the appetizers, the onion rings are the best of all the bunch. The wings with bleu cheese didn't work for me. The Nacho's was made with fresh chips, but for some reason the meat, sour cream and everything else didn't mesh together. The white truffle french fries was unique and worth a try if you must have french fries.  Their shakes were on the overly sweet side to the point where the kids didn't even finish half.",

    "text": "Just an FYI: this restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood. Now for my review:  My husband loooves Gordon Ramsay. Lately he's been watching reruns of Kitchen Nightmares, and I've been trying to avoid hearing it in the background (yuck!). When we were staying in Vegas, I knew we had to go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. If you're dining at Burger, there'll likely be a line. We waited for about 20-30 minutes, and were offered a seat at the bar and we took it. The line seemed to die down around 10 pm (on a Sunday night).   Yes, this is a splurge. You're paying for the experience of eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant. That said, my burger was outstanding. I had the U.K. burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had, if not the best. It had fresh green arugula and chutney on it. I'm not sure if they grow their arugula, but as someone who's currently growing lettuce, it usually only looks and tastes as fresh as it did if it was harvested recently. The other standout of the night was the white sangria. It was amazing. It has apple, pear, and cinnamon - just fantastic!  I'm only knocking off a star, because of a few things:  - I wasn't a fan of my husband's Hell's Kitchen burger. The flavor was just odd to me. - The online menu needs to be updated. - I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato fries. Maybe I wished they were more savory. They were kind of sweet, but not like dessert. It seemed like they were having an identity crisis.  Otherwise, if we're in Vegas again I might have to come back for the U.K. burger!",

It is located in the Planet Holleywood hotel on the strip.  Look for the huge fire burning restuarant entrance sign, it was so cool!    One of the best burgers I have ever had!!  I ordered the Bluecheese Burger and let me tell you, each bite I took was so satisfying.  The bluecheese and fig sread went so well together along with thhe arugula.  I ordered medium on my beef patty and it was cooked to perfection.  The entire burger went well together, so tasty, tender, and delicious.  The bun is super soft and sort of just melts together with everything else.  The truffle fries were really good too.  One order of truffle fry is enough to share between two.  They weren't stingy on the parmesan cheese either which I liked.  The girlfriend ordered the Ultimate Burger and she agrees that it is really good.  She wasn't feeling to well and had half a burger left for the next day.  She lightly warmed it up the next day and it was still just as good.    Service was great.  Our waitress was nice and friendly.  Prices are reasonable and totally worth my money.  We spent about 46 bucks before tips, but we only had water.  Still I think the price is good for the high quality burger.  I totally recomment you check this place out if you are looking for an amazing burger.  I will definately be returning to this place again!",

The door opens at 11 am but already long line was formed...  I would say at least 30 people waiting in line..  Luckily I was 3rd person in line.  In the beginning dining area was empty but in minutes, whole place was filled up.  Hell's burger was very spicy... So if you can't handle hot spicy food, I don't recommend.  However, Farmers burger is good for every age.  Uncooked york of the egg makes burger more juicer and nicely blends with the patty.  Putine fries are nothing like the ones I ate in Canada..  It was totally different but visual, and taste is something you must try...",

We were the first to be seated and first to have our burgers served. Although we were the first, it still took 30 mins for the burgers to be mad after we placed our order! Def pack your patience and don't come too hungry!   Lobster and shrimp burger - saw it on \"Worth It\" Buzzfeed channel aka basically  what we came for. In sum, it reminded me of eating a bunch of shui mai  (dim sum dumplings) sandwiched into a burger. Not exactly how I imagined it.. tasted fine but a little plain to be honest. With pickled  carrots as the only topping, it became boring almost immediately.   Hells Kitchen's burger - traditional burger with jalapenos chili and avocado slices - tasty but compared to Holstein's the night before, it was pretty forgettable. Safe choice for those trying out Gordon Ramsey's burger for the first time though - original flavor with a slight twist.   Sweet potato fries - game changer! - going to start dusting all my fries in powdered sugar.   Overall - good burger but definitely not worth the ridiculous line/wait line.",

I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger ($15) with Manchego cheese, figgy Jam, arugula, took off the Spicy Mayo and it was GLORIOUS!

Once seated, our server was very prompt and exceptionally courteous.   After making our selections for drinks and food arrived rather quickly. The lettuce wrap for burgers is very well done and I was actually able to hold it and eat it and not use a fork and knife like I do at most places. The Parmesan truffle fries were fantastic! Definitely order these! They were perfect!",

Walking up to the restaurant, there's a wall of glass with the name of the restaurant and a fire display within the glass wall. And let me tell you, you can feel the heat; the heat was on!  Looking at the menu, it was difficult choosing which burger I wanted to try. This was in November of 2017, so they were offering the Anniversary Burger which didn't help my decision. I was with two friends, so we decided to each order a different burger, then cut our burgers into fourths and give a piece to each other. That way, we could all have a taste of three different mouth watering burger combinations created by the man himself.  I ordered the Anniversary Burger, and I'm sorry I cannot remember which ones my friends ordered. But what I do remember is that all of the burgers were delicious. It was everything we dreamed of!! The burgers were full flavor, were not over or undercooked, and presentation was on point. And not to mention, the staff was nice and attentive.   If you're in Vegas, I know there's plenty of restaurants to choose from, but you should definitely put Gordon Ramsay Burger on your agenda.",

When we arrived, we came here in a group of four at 9 pm and waited about an hour and a half for a table. By the time we were at the front of the line, we were super hungry - but we were told that a party of four would take 45 minutes longer, so we ended up splitting our party into pairs.   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Kettle Chip Nachos. The burger was really good! The beef patty was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. However, I was extremely disappointed with the nachos as the chips were basically drenched in oil. The chips were soggy from all the oil in this dish. One of my relatives felt sick to her stomach after eating this dish, and she was sick for the next few days of our trip.   Overall, I would not line up again and wait to eat those nachos. If I come back to Vegas, I'll be heading over to Ramsay's Fish and Chips instead!",

The lady friend and I came here to get our traditional vacation burger fix.  No matter the trip, we always end up at a local burger establishment.  We decided on this one because of the namesake celebrity chef.  The restaurant has a very chain like feel and it's extremely busy.  The wait staff is flying around in circles trying to hurry up and turn those tables!  They want you to scarf down those 20.00 burgers so they can get the next sucker in here to buy a 20.00 burger.    I had the farmhouse burger which comes with a fancy cheese, fancy bacon and a fried egg.  They cook the burgers to order and the fried egg oozes out upon 1st bite.  The burger is actually pretty damn good but it's 17.00 and comes with nothing else.  The fries are fresh cut and have to be ordered separately for 8.00.  Now the fries will feed 2.  We each ordered 2 beers to wash it down.  4 beers, 2 burgers and 1 fry and I spent damn near the same money as a 5 star restaurant back home in Nola.  The food was solid but you are paying for the neon light bill of the casino it's in.  Be warned",

I had the farm burger while she got the ultimate cheeseburger. Farm burger was cooked just right medium, bacon crispy, egg runny when bit into center. Yummy. Took a couple of bites of her ultimate cheeseburger adding bacon to it also cooked medium, just as good with it's own different taste. Had the onion rings for the first time and discovered what I was missing out on my first to visits as these were the best onion rings ever. Crunchy every bite with the sauces just as amazing.",

Made absolutley no sense.  Watched manager only expoing and accasionally standing in front of bev station looking around. No coaching... was def. Not in control of his restaurant. The restaurant was running him. Food took a while, orings were terribly greasy.  Gave two stars because burgers were good.  Do yourself a favor.. go somewhere else for your burger fix.

    "text": "I'm rating Gordon Ramsay Burger a 3 stars because I rate a restaurant based on the food, dining area and experience. The food was just ok, nothing memorable. It's supposed to be gourmet Burgers whatever that is with fry's fancy ketchup that I had a hard time keeping down. The service was not very good. Waiter walked over said hello then walked away. Came back took our order, not being very helpful about the menu. Didn't explain anything! About 15 minutes later he walks by and we ask about how much longer will this take. He's answer was well it take about 30 min to cook a burger. You've only been waiting for 10min. Ok, Ass!!!! If you would have mentioned that during our order we would have added some appetizers. We waited over an hour and a half to get in this place. And it was totally NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!!  I definitely expected more with it have Gordon Ramsay's name attached to it.",

Review:  Sweet Potato fries: 10/10; crispy, delicious & FULL of flavor!!! You have the option to have the fries served with powdered sugar (passed on this because I like my fries savory)...it's served with a housemate chipotle ketchup & honey jalapeno jam  Truffle Fries: 10/10; these were life changing...the truffle used to top the British chips were full of flavor!!! The truffle was superb, my tastebuds were very much happy.   Farmhouse Burger: 10/10; best. BURGER. ever. The duck bacon, gooey cheese, caramelized mushrooms, & medium rare meat...could you ask for anything more ???   I highly recommend dining here, whatever you order, you will not be disappointed. Gordon, you nailed this one!",

Location is still a meh for me. As a non smoker I have a hard time seated next to an area where there is smoking allowed; open to casino floor.   Wait was significantly lighter this time as we ate late lunch as opposed to heavy traffic dinner time.   I had the fish and crisp, and poutine \"appetizer\".  I messed up and requested poutine with main but that thing was a main entree all by itself. (Reheats and taste great the next day as leftovers). Fish and crisp was great but a little on the heavy side.",

    "text": "Welp. Wanted to be like the cool kids and give this a shot.   THE GOOD:  1. Line moved quickly. We took under 10 mins at 7.30pm to get a table.   2. Whatever ketchup they used was awesome!  THE OK:  1. Service was slow.   2. Food was ok. I ordered the Forest Burger, which had mushrooms, cheese and duck bacon. Bacon tasted good. Beef pattie was tough unfortunately, and the mushrooms were overlooked little rubber tires. I asked for lettuce wrapped and they were great with that. So that was good. But the food was forgettable. Wouldn't come back.   3. Husband ordered The Farmhouse Burger. He tells me it was a 7/10 so that is good!  3. The fries were good. Not perfect, but good. Solid effort.   THE BAD:  1. My biggest complaint was the ambience and NOISE!!!! Good grief, if I wanted my ears to bleed I would have gone to a frikken Iron Maiden Concert. There is No carpet anywhere and the noise just resounds to the point where you have  to SHOUT to be heard. I am in the audiology industry and 85 dB is where hearing loss begins to occur as a result of noise damage, and I clocked an average of 83dB in this restaurant. So damn loud to the point of super uncomfortable. Just bad form Gordon.   2. TVs were broken down and not playing- kind of added to the vibe of lack of care.   All in all, for the price, I wouldn't come back due to the noise and lack of ambience. For my money, I'd go elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is one of the few 1 star reviews I'll ever give and I didn't even go to Gordon Ramsay Burger. This review is of the reservation system they have set up there.   It all started with me calling them to make reservations about a month in advance for July 3rd. I wanted to reserve a dinner for my family of 15. Everything went fine until they emailed me. The email said that because we have a large group, it's a minimum of $95 a person and we have to pay an estimated down payment ahead of time. I thought they must be joking. How can you bill someone a meal BEFORE they even eat it? Probably the most absurd thing is that even though it's $95 a person, they sent me a list of set menus that had a couple of three course meals for $70-80 each. That means pay $1500 up front? That means that every person has to have a drink? Well, we have 5 children a couple of my family members that don't drink.  So when I tried to talk to the \"Sales Manager\" Heather, she just so happens to be on vacation for the week. As popular as the Gordon Ramsay name is, I can't believe this is how they function when someone tries to book a party ahead of time. There's no way I'm going to pay money ahead of time for food we haven't ate and I can't believe people actually would. Even though I expect great food and great service, it's a people's business and all it takes is one person to have a bad day to ruin our experience. How do you expect us to pay for that in advance?",

The Forest Burger is awesome with the duck bacon as is the mushroom poutine. The brown butter pecan shake is the perfect sweet note and is like a dessert dish on its own. Other favorites include the Hells Kitchen Burger and Farmhouse Burger. The burgers dont come with fries so you can order those on their own. One order of fries can easily be shared between 2-3 people. I do have to say that fries were a little dry and bland. Still, we loved this place!

    "text": "I thought it was strange when the listing for Gordon Ramsay BurGR was marked as \"closed\" on Yelp. Then I find out they remodeled. But.......what was even remodeled?! Everything practically looked the same. Except for a menu change.   Yes, burgers may be expensive at $15 an order and that's WITHOUT fries. Adding a side of fries will be an additional $9-11. Get the parmesan truffle fries....yum!!!!!!! The burgers are  delicious and full of flavor. It's a perfect size, enough to make you feel full but it doesn't make you feel like a bloated person waddling outta there. You can request how well you want your burgers cooked and they're pretty on point with that. The Hell's Kitchen burger is all that I order. It's spicy with jalapenos, cheese and avocados. Typing this is making me salivate.     Keep in mind, DO NOT come here when you're starving/hangry. Not only will you have to wait for a table since it seems like there's always a wait here. My party of 4 and I were here for dinner on a normal Thursday evening and we still have to wait about 20 minutes. So after our waitress took our orders, she informed us that the burgers will take 30 minutes to make. WHATTTTT.....30 MINUTES!?!?! Urmm....okay, that caught me off guard. Wow...patience is a virtue here at Gordon Ramsay. I mean, she gave us the option of having the fries out first so we can munch on those but we didn't wanna spoil our dinner and get full off fries. But....different strokes for different folks? *shurgs*  All in all, this burger joint is definitely a must. Much better than Shake Shack in NY NY or this burger place at Fashion Show Mall. Come here instead. I will forever be returning here for my gourmet burger fix.",

The burgers we did order were NOT delicious - they were AWFUL.  4 of us in the party and no one finished theirs.  We ate what we were served as it took FOREVER to get our food and we were starving.  Plus, we had to send 2 of them back to be remade as they were overcooked (we asked for medium rare, not chared) .Fortunately we are Diamond players so we did not have to wait in the 45 min to 1hour plus line, but I PITY whoever waits for this crappy food.  The cafe would have been better.  I eat burgers once a week and was looking forward to Burgrs, what a let down.  Maybe change the name to BUGGERS.    GORDON, YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR ALLOWING YOUR NAME ON THIS PLACE, BUT I GUESS THE LICENSING FEES YOU RECEIVE MORE THEN MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF FLAVOR, SERVICE ETC...  I can only hope that your star is now fading in Vegas and soon ALL of the place with YOUR NAME attached go under.  I cannot wait to see what takes the place of this joint (I cant even bring myself to call it a restaurant) - HOPEFULLY by the end of the year....or sooner.  * SHAME ON PLANET HOLLYWOOD or the F & B manager or whoever for allowing this place to remain open.  Apparently, I am in the minority as there are rave reviews here. Those who gave 4 or 5 star reviews most likely NEVER had the opportunity to eat at the original BURGR, or they would probably change their ratings.",

    "text": "This is my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant and let's say I was expecting a bit more, but still enjoyed my experience overall. We decided to each order a burger and share so in case we wanted more, we knew what we would order. We ordered: The Hog Burger: surprise burger of the group, as my party and I didn't expect much because our waitress sold us on the special burger (\"F Word\") on our particular visit. This is layers on layers of pork, it isn't wasn't saturated in grease, and it was quick flavorful. All of the flavors mended well together and was the surprise \"favorite\" pick amongst us (party of 4). Being as hungry as we were, we decided to try Chef Ramsay's take on poutine. It was winner for us as we enjoyed the mixture of gravy, duck bacon, cheese curds, and vinegar pickled shallots. My friend even said on her next visit, maybe she'll just have an order of this by herself. It satisfied our taste buds and piqued our interest on what else was coming our way. Shrimp and Lobster Burger: had a nice texture and though I liked the curry that seasoned the patty, I felt like it muted the shrimp and lobster flavor (as we know those aren't prominent to begin with). Still a pretty good burger, but I felt it could have been better. Hell's Kitchen Burger: had a subtle kick to it from the jalepeno ingredients, but wasn't overpowering. The avocado did help quell the heat and add another flavor profile to the burger itself. I would say this was the second best burger of the group. \"F Word\" Burger: this was the special (off menu) during my visit, which is constructed with a patty that is a blend of a 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. Though sold as soon as we heard the ingredient list of this bad boy, we felt like all the flavors were not pronounced enough, but was still a good hunk of a burger. We noticed all the beef patties were consistently good (they have that process down) and the difference on the beef burgers were just the toppings/condiments associated with each \"specialty\".",

Sadly did not have the opportunity to dine at Burger thanks to the horrific customer service beginning with hostess Sterling and ending with manager Joe Rich. Such an incredibly discerning Michelin Chef needs to make sure the issues are handled. See all the reviews over the last 30 days have all been dissatisfied with the appalling customer service. My satisfaction is having walked up to Mr. Rich (lacking greatly in skill for his position) and asking \"are you the Manager\", replied yes. I said \"no doubt that your staff is a reflection of you\"! Did not do anything to professionally handle our situation. We have invested time and money (a lot) and my daughter & boyfriend who took us have visited everyone of your establishments (except this one thanks to the poor service & management) WE WALKED OUT!! Sad m, but will not put another cent towards any of your establishments.",

I would only pay $8 at most for such burger or avoid having it. I think I was too nice to refuse to pay the meal but I would never forget the pain and regret.   Probably, the better burgers I had here before was just an accident. The cooks are incapable of making equivalent burgers and they may not know how to cook good burgers. And it is even Gordon Ramsay's. Hilarious.  It is really a shame they are still open and many tourists come to have such terrible experience.

    "text": "After watching the Bruno Mars concert, the wife and I headed back towards our hotel and stumbled on this gem of a restaurant inside the PH. It was about 11pm and didn't expect to wait as long as we did. I should have known better, this was Vegas! We stood in line for about 45 minutes before we got seated. Took off one star for this experience. They have a dedicated line for couples and trios; larger parties skip the line and head straight to the hostess for seating. Why penalize the smaller parties. When we got to the front of the line, we counted three parties of six that were seated before us. How about clearing one or two couples in between seatings for the larger parties to make it equitable?  We got seated and proceeded to order. I went with the cheeseburger with bacon and egg and the wife went with the one with arugula. And some fries. In about 5 minutes, a runner came with a plate of tritip nachos. We didn't touch it and waited for our waiter. Asked him what it was and he immediately realized it was wrong. To our surprise, he took the plate away. Why didn't he just leave it? It's not like he could have served it to another party? He came back a minute later and offered it to us no charge. It was excellente! Found out later that it was intended for the trio of drunk girls next to us, to which we had some good conversation.  The burgers came out, and it was perfectly cooked. Medium as we ordered. These burgers were legit, the bun was great and the fixins were perfect. Great great burger. Bacon was thick and crispy and the egg yolk made a de facto sauce for the beef. Wish I came back. And surprisingly didn't feel too gross after. Fries - just ok. I've tasted some awesome fries and this here is lacking. (my baseline for great fries? Lazy Dog)  Legit burger!",

    "text": "The food was GREAT!  My rating is due to a few things I wouldn't expect to experience at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  1.  The wait is ridiculous.  We waited over 1 hour for a table when there were easily 12 were available.  We then waited 15 min. for a waiter to finally to come over. 2. The basics are missing. There was no Equal sweetener available in the entire restaurant. They \"ran out.\" They also we're \"running low\" on mustard and gave me 1/10 of a serving size of it when I asked the waiter for it. He never brought it over, by the way. I had to go get it myself from the kitchen area.   Overall, if you're looking for a great burger, have 3 hours to kill, and don't mind mediocre service, this is your place.",

Since the mushroom was the medium for this dish, it did not mellow out the flavors well  - Truffle Parmesan Fries - your basic truffle parm fries  - Farmhouse Burger - dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg - I was highly disappointed in the burger, the bread was amazingly cold and dry.. the works inside were good though..  Maybe I went on an off day?  Hopefully I did, I do want to give it another shot.",

I reiterated three times that we needed to get to a Vegas show. Waitresses was annoyed and rudely told me In a condescending manner that the wait for the food would be 15 minutes, it was already 30 minutes. There was a station next to our table and there were 5-7 servers hanging out for 5-7 minutes during different intervals while I watched plates of food sitting on the cook lines for 5-10 minutes without anyone delivering the food. Food arrived and both burgers were undercooked. The first server had given our table to a kind male server who tried to appease the poor food. The fries were cold. I actually had the manager hold one of my greasy fries. Food is expensive $17-20 for a cheese burger but not worth it. Fries are soggy and greasy, $8.  I do not recommend this eatery. Very disorganized. Manager was kind and brought my burger in a to go box but the ambience was already over. How do I enjoy a $20 burger in a box?",

After waiting about 30 minutes, my Hells Kitchen burger arrived. It was juicy and all the toppings went well together. It was fantastic burger and definitely the best burger I've had in Vegas. I didn't give it a five star rating because the regular fries were cold when they served them. Moreover, we also orders sweet potato fries and they had sugar on them (who does that!?!) which were lukewarm as well. That being said, I will definitely return.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that I'm not a Gordon Ramsey fan. Never watched Hell's Kitchen, or anything. But the memes I find on the internet about him are hilarious!  Hubby had been wanting to check this place out for the past year, so during our last trip to Vegas over LDW, I thought what the heck, let's try it out.  We waited in line for about about 20 minutes, when one of the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the chefs table. I didn't really want to stand in line anymore since I was starving, so we took it. I'll admit, they made it sound like a cooler experience when they were telling us about the chefs table, so I was a little disappointed when it was just a bar counter. Fine, I'll let this pass, my expectations were a little too high.  This is where things went pretty sour. First, it took about 15 minutes for a server to say anything to us, another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and about 45 minutes to get our food. Considering that i was starving, I was in a pretty hangry mood. I couldn't believe how slow this place was. I'll give it to the cooks, they were moving pretty fast at times, but other times, they were just standing around waiting for the food to cook. I noticed that the burgers would all come at one time, about 5 or so, and then the cooks would just be standing waiting for more food to cook. It's like they would cook the food in shifts, rather than being constant. Why not just consistently be cooking, rather than putting everything together, then waiting for the food to be ready together?   Now about the food: I had the Tendori Chicken, lettuce wrapped. All I asked for was the chicken, and cheese wrapped in lettuce. Not too complicated right? Well, the chicken has some kind of sauce that took away the goodness of it. But since I was starving, I just let it go and ate it. But I wasn't a fan of this sauce. When I asked the server what this sauce was, she didn't know, and had to ask a chef, who looked liked he didn't know either, and then just settled it with being \"marinade\". Umm no, this was not cooked with the chicken. This was tossed on top of the chicken. There is a difference.  Hubby had the Backyard burger, no complaints from him. He thought it was ok. High quality ingredients, but not really worth the price tag.  We decided to share an order of sweet potato fries, which are huge btw! We both weren't a fan of the powdered sugar they added. I don't get powdered sugar on fries. Whats the point of it?   Overall, I don't think I will come back. There are better burger places around Vegas. At least I got hubby off my back with trying this place out!",

I ordered the Turducken burger with a side order of truffle Parmesan fries.  FYI, none of the burgers come with sides but the fries are worth the $12.  We started with the Poutine and scarfed that down in minutes - it was absolutely amazing!    Definitely come with your stomachs empty because the food is awesome and the portions are huge!

    "text": "Beautiful burger at beautiful venue! We could not enjoy our burger at the restaurant as there was an half hour wait at 6pm Monday night! Plus our children were restless then. So we bought two burgers and ate at hotel. Even then the burgers were destroyed by us in seconds while fighting over who will have the last bites! It's that good!   The buns were tasty and fluffy with sesame seeds.  The beef patty were real quality meat that was cooked perfectly to our order, medium well done, while succulent with a bit of red inside.  The matching of the sauces, herbs and condiments bring unique flavors to each burger but retains the original flavors of the star, the burger itself.  I don't know much about Godon Ramsay but having gone to both his fish and burger restaurants, this man really knows food!",

Burgers really well prepared and all the builds were perfect - 4 shared 3 burgers and 3 sides and still didn't finish all the sides!  Pork burger was amazing.   Great food, reasonable price given who's name is above the door, certainly would recommend to anyone who wanted to try one of his restaurants on the strip but lost in the casinos in the way in.",

You have not had a great great shake until you try these.  In four days we can easily order 10 of them. They cost around $9 but it is totally worthy. Their creme brulee one with either chocolate or cookies and cream ice cream OMG. I crave it all the time and I do not even have a sweet tooth. Also, forget about eating healthy, we are talking SHAKES. They are big and filling. They may take a bit to make but again, worth the wait. The staff in the front is helpful, some more than others but the servers, the manager and the food make up for it.  Cannot recommend it enough.",

Ordered onion rings, way to greasey and flavorless. Sent them back and we got sweet potatoe fries. Center of the fries were raw and the outside was so greasy that they eventually all stuck together. Gross!  Fish & chips burger. So dry! The sauce was invisible! Trying to flag down my waitress was also a mission. Terrible service and they still ended up charging us for everything, including the items we returned.   Huge disappointment because I am a fan of Gordon Ramsey restaurants.

I have been to Vegas 3x since and never got an opportunity to go. This year was finally my chance. My Wife and I were sat at the Chefs table and I was stoked! Well needless to say I assumed Gordon Ramsay restaurant quick bites or not would be ran cleanly and with decent food. Well I was wrong and this has to be the biggest food disappointment to date! I ordered the Hell Kitchen Burger as recommended by the waitress, and a Oreo Shake. My wife order a water and the Cherry Popper Chicken Sandwich based on the waitress recommendation. As we sat there and seen the burger chef smash all the goodness out of every burger and countless orders or fries sit under the warmer I started to question what was really going on here. The main chef checking orders before they went out was holding dish tubs, rubbing his bare hands on his jeans, opening and closing the little fridges, and then sticking those same fingers in the ketchup cups! GROSS and unsanitary! When my burger finally arrived the presentation was good. I prepared with to finally eat Burger heaven. When I bit into my suppose to be medium rare burger I realized it was really rare! I was like you can't even cooks burger to temp here?!? I decided to eat it anyway. After the second bite I realized this burger is never going to taste better. It literally tasted like a everything bagel with avocado. There was not flavor to the burger, the texture was crap, and all the other Hells Kitchen flavors were no existent. I decided to try my wife chicken which has crispy chicken skin on it. The skin was so Chewy she couldn't eat. We asked for our check and left super disappointed and hungry! I won't even start in on the stale warmer baby truffle fries! Good luck diners but I caution you about this place. It could use a visit from Gordon himself and hope he can fix his own nightmare!",

He didn't greet us with a simple hello or ask us how we were let alone introduce himself.   He merely handed us the menu and said he'd be back in 5 mins - ok cool, what if we had questions? Or wanted recommendations?  He came back took our order and that was honestly the last time we saw him. We anticipated before we ordered that he needed the check spilt and he rolled his eyes! To top it all off he charged the wrong cards with the wrong amounts which resulted in people owing each other money. UGH.  We left him NO tip - he didn't deserve one. He spent his time chatting with expensive regulars next to us clearly schmoozing to get a job not in the food industry.   *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***   The Positive We visited on a busy Las Vegas Fight Weekend (GGG V Canelo 2) and were seated within 20 mins - not bad.

Oh well, gives me an excuse to come back for more. The service was great. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and recommend us drinks.  We ordered their signature Hell's Kitchen Burger ($17 USD), which consists of asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocados, roasted tomato, and jalapeno aioli. This phenomenal burger is worthy to be called a signature dish -- a thick juicy patty cooked to perfection with everything sandwiched between two toasted sesame buns. The avocados and cheese adds a layer of creaminess. Some would argue that you need some greens to balance it out but this savoury burger hit the spot for me. Flavours: 8/10 Juicy, creamy, savoury Value: 7/10 - The second burger we ordered was the Stout Burger ($16 USD), made with Guinness mustard aioli, gruyere cheese, mushrooms, and crispy onions. This monstrous burger was extremely heavy. I personally love savoury and fatty foods, but this was a little over the top. Don't worry, it's not something a refreshing beer can't fix!  I would definitely recommend coming here to try it out if you haven't already! It's worth your while. Flavours: 6/10 juicy, savoury, fatty Value: 6/10 Overall Service 8/10 Total $: 23 USD",

Son didn't like his forest burger but I like my blue cheese and hubby liked his stout. Bums were lightly toasted and soft. Burgers were cooked to our liking and not greasy at all. Onion rings were all clumped together and more batter than onion. Fries were good and the dipping sauce too. Not too sure if we would return.",

You can't make reservations here either, so your best bet is to go during a less popular time or wait in a really long line.  The burgers were delicious. I tried the Blue cheeseburger. The blue cheese was subtle and blended well with the other elements of the burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger was also yummy. The burgers don't come with fries, so we ordered the truffle Parmesan fries to share. It came with two sauces that had very different flavors, but added a nice twist.  A star is lost due to the lackluster service. Overall, great burgers at a decent price.",

The taste was really good, well cooked, can't imagine how we enjoyed our meals. Onion ring was a good appetizer.  Drawback:  party of 3 or more should stay more in line or leave their phone number; however we waited 20 min or less. +A bit salty.  All in all was so good. (The front burger in the picture)",

After 15 mins I approached the desk and asked how much longer. I guess they took us off the list all together. A manager was nearby and was able to get us seated right away.

After a 1 hour wait, we finally were told a table was ready.   Then. We couldn't be seated as Gordon did photos with patrons.   Then, he had a meeting with 3 others in the booth next to us.   We watched as his food rolled out before any patrons.   In all, we waited just under 2 hours for a Burger that looked amazing - but was over $30 per plate with fries ( no drinks but water - which tasted bad - like it wasn't even filtered ).   Fries were chewy - not crisp as advertised. We watched the kitchen for an hour while we waited. It was amazing to watch plates or burgers and fries spend sometimes over 10 minutes waiting for a pickup.  ( a hotdog sat for 12 min )  Waitress was amazing. Place looks great. Clean.  Food slightly better than average. Cost for value - excessive.   Lesson learned - celebrity chefs make great TV.  Not great burger spots.",

We chose the bar for quick service as we had plans for the day.   I ordered the Portabello Mushroom Burger and my friend ordered the Blu Cheese Burger. We shared the Truffle Oil French Fries to complete our lunch. Both burgers were amazing! The Truffle Oil French Fries were a bit of a disappointment. First all, the fries were soggy. French Fries should, under no circumstances, be soggy. Second, the truffle oil was very faint. it's like they ran out of truffle oil and gave us the small drop that they had left.   French fries are my life! I love them. I always order them. These french fries were disappointing, especially from such a well-known chef as Gordon Ramsay.  I would definitely come back for Gordon's burgers, but I would skip the French Fries next time.",

We went to  Bellagio to see the fountains And a flowers exposition. Came back around 7:40 pm and waited another 20 min for our table to be ready ( even though we had 2 elderly people one of them is disabled and has problems standing- there is no waiting area) I had to ask hostess twice to check if they can do anything about our situation. Finally at about 8:10 pm we got the table.  The other disappointment was that to get a vegan burger we have to pay extra to substitute meat patty for beyond burger patty. I can buy them in a store pretty cheap why in the hell we had to pay extra!  And the only way they can serve it is as a wrap.  No buns!  The rest was very good experience. Service is outstanding. Burgers very delicious. French fries is big enough to shear between 2-3 people. Timing for getting food after we ordered was very reasonable. Every one were pleased with their food. I might come back if I'm a part of a meat eaters party, but it won't be my choice if it's just my vegan friends. But I would recommend it to try at least once and have that experience!",

I am a big mushroom fan and I absolutely loved the delicate Chanterelle mushrooms nestled in my burger. We also ordered one side of the \"Just Fries\" which came with two kinds of ketchup, Chipotle and curry ketchup. I would recommend just one side of fries for two people to share, as it was plenty for us. All in all, everything was extremely delicious, and certainly worth the wait.

    "text": "My family and I went here on a whim since the reviews were so great, and my late-night binge watchings of Gordon Ramsay. So my expectations were super high. Unfortunately, our experience was terrible. Went here at 12 in the afternoon, and we had to wait 15 minutes just to be seated. We ordered the truffle fries, some Thai/curry shrimp salad, and a blue cheese burger. It took roughly an hour and 30 minutes just to receive the order. Our fries were room temperature and stale, though the truffle sauce was good. The burger wasn't charred, it was burnt. You couldn't taste the cheese or the meat whatsoever, all you could taste was the bitterness of the burnt parts. Now here's the worst part: the salad. The shrimp was the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten. I've had plenty of curries in my life, and nothing has ever compared to the burnt, sodium-ridden shrimp that we were served here. Left with less than half the burger gone, only a few fries gone, and a plate full of salad and shrimp. Maybe we just got a bad batch of everything, who knows? Skip this place and go eat somewhere more worth your money.",

This time, we were there on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't crowded, and yet the service was still slow. I think the part that got me was that when I flagged down a waiter from another table to point out the cockroach skittering across the floor, he didn't even speak to me; he just scooped it up in a napkin and went back to laughing with his waiter-buddy. I would have thought a comment \"oh dear\" or brief apology would have been in order. I definitely get a \"we don't care; we don't have to\" vibe from this place. Overall: Meh.",

The onion rings were out of this world and it came with two different sauces, both delicious. French fries, I woudn't go crazy about them, a bit mushy. Just that we got seated next to the burning flames which I guess is part of the decor at the end of March, and the waiters were not willing to seat us somewhere else and would want us to go out and wait in the line again if we wanted a different seat. I am not sure what's Gordon's plan for those flames in the summer, it was only March and we were burning already. Maybe that would make people order more beers.",

It has good flavor, but the saltiest thing I've ever in my life tasted. The rest of the salad was a basic green leaf salad. Worth $16? NO.  Parmesan truffle fries. It was OKAY. Nothing special other than sprinkled cheese and garlic on fat soggy fries. Worth $12? NO.  Lastly service was extremely slow and lackluster.  Friendly employees at least.",

I did try his onion rings and though they were good, one was enough as didn't feel like deep fried battered that night , as it was very filling.  My burger ordered med-rare and was cooked perfectly.  Beers on tap are plentiful and actually pretty good priced starting at $7 (remember this is Vegas I paid at some places $13 for the same beers).  Service was awesome and constantly checking on us. Usually I am not a fan of burger places that charge around $14 for just a burger, with sides extra, but this is one place where I found it worth it.

My husband had the Hells Kitchen burger pictured below topped with green chiles and avocado slices. $36 for two burgers  It's Vegas after all.

The wait to get in was not as bad as I had expected (they do not take reservations) being only around 20 minutes for parties of two, which most of those waiting seemed to be. If you have a party of 3 or more, they seem to be seated more quickly.  The line to enter the restaurant runs past a 8' high glass wall with large, dancing flames spaced about 10\" apart which makes for a somewhat uncomfortable wait despite the thick double glass walls. It's hot enough in Vegas without having to stand next to an artificial open flame fireplace while waiting to be seated.  We had hamburgers, naturally, and the Truffle Fries were quite a nice experience.  Service was quick, the food good and ,although high, the prices were reasonable for being on The Strip.  All things considered, I'd eat here again.",

I liked that the buns were grilled but I didn't care for the patties. I had the hog burger. Too much pork for me and it was in the dry side.  I really wish they would serve fish and chips.   I liked that our waitress said we could order grilled cheese for our toddler. I probably would have ordered it for myself too if I hadn't gotten the burger.",

I tried the Pork burger which had an amazing match of flavors, the burger was the base for a juicy slab of pork on top with great flavor enhancers.  My daughter enjoyed the parmesan fries too!  Said if they were curly and smaller they would be as good as Arby's, OK so her palet is not that sophisticated!  My wife had a Kale Salad that was a HUGE miss.  Some of the Kale leaves were yellow and had spots on them.  When we showed them to the waitress she asked the Chef, who said kale comes in many colors.  True, but not yellow with spots.  We threw in the BS flag, so the waitress (with attitude) went to get the manager.  Manager never showed and just took it off our bill.  Moral of story, don't get a salad at a burger place!",

I grew up watching the myriad of Gordon Ramsay reality TV shows, so when my family was in Vegas with me for a night, we knew we had to stop into one of his restaurants.  The first thing that surprised us was the stunning length of the line. Luckily, for groups of three or more, you can have them text you when your table is ready.   The burgers are delicious. You could make the argument that they aren't worth the price, but honestly, for the experience, and just knowing that I'm in an incredibly touristy city to start with, it felt like a fair price.  It's definitely something you need to experience at least once!",

I've heard really great things about this restaurant and I'm so happy I got to experience it myself. I really enjoyed my meal, and so did my parents (who usually don't like \"American food\".  Order: - Hell's Kitchen Burger (5/5) - Farmhouse Burger (5/5) - Crown Burger (5/5)  Pros: - Amazing food ~ the burgers were cooked to perfect and the onion rings and fries were crispy and delicious  - Great service ~ our waiter (I believe his name is Josh) explained the menu well and checked up on us regularly to make sure we were enjoying the food - A lot of great options to choose from ~ they have more than just burgers (apparently the wings are amazing too) - Large burgers ~ don't be fooled by the photos. Looking through Yelp, I thought the burger would be small, but they're actually pretty large  Cons: - Expensive ~ Each burger is about $16 - Long wait ~ Including the time waiting in line and waiting for our food, my family and I probably spent about 1 hour waiting - Hard to find ~ the restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. It took us a minute to finally find a sign pointing in the general direction of the restaurant, not to mention we had to cross the whole casino   Overall: - Despite the hefty price, Gordon Ramsay Burger is WELL worth the wait (when in Vegas, right?)",

I didn't realize this was the \"cheapest\" of Gordon's restaurants until my wife showed me the other high-end prices, yikes!     We didn't wait too long for our food; I ordered a Farmhouse Burger, beer-battered onion rings and this caramel-shake concoction that I couldn't finish! The burger was one of best I'd ever had, hands down. The bill was high but to be expected...and well worth it!

Was it the best burger I ever tried? Indeed it was!   The design of this place is really nice and gives off chill vibes. Our waiter was really nice and handled everything well. For appetizer, we ordered the hell fire chicken wings which was finger lickin good. The flavor, the level of spiciness, and how crispy the wings were to perfection! My husband and I decided to order 2 different burgers and split it to try the difference. I ordered the hells burger and my husband ordered the  Stout burger. As for the side we ordered just fries which is enough for 2 people and that was also really good. I'm not a fries kind of person but I must say these fries hit the spot with their different varieties of ketchup which was fused with chipotle and curry.   The burgers did not disappoint and I was really impressed with everything.  The stout burger was my favorite it was really delicious. My husband didn't have any favorites he just loved everything equally because it was that good for him.",

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay was my favorite childhood celebrity chef. Known for his  uncensored comments to competing chefs, I was always drawn in to the drama. I had high hopes of his burger restaurant in Vegas.  The line wasn't too bad at 1pm on a Sunday. You line up along the fire lit sign outside. It was about a 20 minute wait.  I was super hungover from the night before and just wanted a glass of water. Service was extremely slow and it took around 10 minutes for the water to come out even after checking up on it.   I saw some white girls post on yelp that the beer battered onion rings were amazing. I knew I shouldn't have believed them! The rings were overly battered and soo oily. Not worth.  I ordered the Hell's kitchen burger and my friend ordered the forest burger. We shared half each and both patties were super dry. The Hell's kitchen burger looked and tasted worse than a normal burger. I wanted some heat from the roasted jalapenos, but it wasn't spicy at all. The forest burger had more flavor because of the tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula and duck bacon, but it was still bland.  Gordon Ramsay really needs to do a kitchen nightmares on his own restaurant! The burger was plated on a large white plate and sooo not pleasing to the eyes. At least add some fried or salad to it!  I expected much better for a restaurant with GR's name. Someone really needs to do a consistency check because i'm still having PTSD from those dry patties. The service was really slow and can be improved.",

    "text": "On my recent trip to Vegas the charge for my family was \"a good burger\".  I like to tell people that I haven't had a good burger since Trump took office.  Very likely a coincidence but you never know.   For starters we got the truffle fries and onion rings. Those onion rings are something else. I've never had an outside so crispy and light yet the inside so toothsome. Must be how they do the fish and chips. If it is. Sign me up.   I liked the thickness of the fries. My only complaint is that the truffle flavor was not very uniform. Some bites were very intense and others had none.   Now for the burger. My patty was actually a hair over but I didn't care. It was juicy and flavorful and the best burger I'd had in a long time. I'm sure any of the other burgers are just as good there.   So there you have it. I got my good burger to hopefully last me at least four more years.",

The restaurant wasn't even half full when we arrived. Entrees took around 30 minutes maybe more. Fries were exceedingly hot but sadly our burgers were not. Mine was even cold and a bit over cooked. As if allowed to cool before adding the cold sauces etc. I did not observe any manager walking the floor nor working off to the side for the entire duration of our meal. Our server checked in so quickly I didn't get a chance to eat any more than a fry. By the time he came back I was ready to pay and leave. I tried emailing their management team to which I have not received a reply other than their events coordinator rapidly saying she forwarded my email to the management team.   Great ambiance, but food execution, management presence, and salvaging a guests poor experience are severely lacking. Pretty sad when the other brands perform at such a high level and Gordon on his many shows preaches such a high level of excellence.",

Don't go to far you only have 10 minutes to get back, or you lose your spot. Although a wait, well worth it. The burgers are amazing. The flavor, everything is throughout out from the burger to what's add to it, to even custom sauce. If you're looking food a meat lovers burger, get the Hog Burger. You want regret it. Friends got the Fish and Chip burger and spoke highly of it as well. Cant have a burger without fries. The Truffle Fries with the sauce, a must have. Definitely worth the wait to taste a burger from the famous Gordon Ramsay",

    "text": "Man, what a disappointment. I probably set myself up for disappointment because I had such high expectations of this place.  I got there early to beat the lunch crowds because there is often a wait for a table. This place offers no reservations so you just gotta arrive and see if they have tables or put yourself in line.  You are greeted at the entrance and taken to a table. The dining area was large, very clean and had a nice modern decor.  The server was great. This was the best thing about the operation. The servers are on top of things. Immediate refills, clearing the table, etc, and they do so without loitering.  The menu basically has appetizers, fries, and burgers. It is not labeled as such but the fries are a huge portion that seem to be intended for sharing. There were regular fries, sweet potato fries, parmesan truffle fries, and maybe another. We asked if we could do half regular and half sweet potato but they said no. Evidently it would be too difficult to fill the thing with some of one and some of the other but maybe I shouldn't expect too much from a $20 order of fried potatoes. So, we ended up with parmesan truffle fries. What a load of crap. The fries were caked with oily parmesan crumbles and they had a ton of garlic flavor. I could hardly taste the actual potato. And the truffle? It's just a little dish of truffle aoli, so basically some mayo with truffle oil and a few tiny shavings of truffle that served no function beyond using the word \"truffle\" on the menu.  I ordered the standard burger cooked medium rare. It came out at least medium, maybe medium well. It was the same cook level as others in my group that had medium well. I don't think the beef was seasoned well but to be honest I couldn't tell because this burger was not balanced.  The bun was huge and fluffy so it basically became mushed bread as I ate the burger. I tasted more bread than meat and cheese. The cheese was American and it was only partially melted. The lettuce, tomato and pickles were chilled which made the meat and cheese cold. The pickles were sweet like butter pickles which I do not think went well on the burger.   Also, the tables are too small. Our burgers, fries, and appetizer came out at the same time and we had no room on the table for all of it. My burger sat there getting cold as I rushed through the appetizer. I really hate when courses are brought to the table early. This shouldn't be a difficult process to manage.  Two burgers, shared fries, shared appetizer, waters and tip = $85. Not worth it. I recommend going somewhere else for a burger.",

I've been to bread street kitchen and this place is way more casual.   Classic Gordon Ramsay restaurants with its amazing decor and wow factor.   They have a separate line for 2 or less people near the firing flame of fire where Gordon Ramsay's burger name is.   If you have over 3 people, check in at the front.   There were about 5 couples ahead of us and the hostess said it would be about 20 min but we waited for only 10.  We got the special Hawaiian burger. It was the best burger ever!!! Not a pineapple ring, but pineapple chunks, marinated pork, with the hamburger and amazing bun.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was so good. A little spicy but amazing.   We also got the pecan milkshake and it was amazing.   We got the truffle fries and it was good but the fries were a little burned.  I wish they gave the fries first because the burgers were pretty filling so we ended up eating half the fries.   Also the shake came first so it was super good but sweet and a little filling.   Service was a tad slow hence the 1 star off. It was not a full house as there were empty tables but it wasn't like amazing service. Water not full, waited around a while for our check, etc.   Overall good place to go for your first time!",

The bun was perfection, the tomatoes and fresh herb aioli was perfect together. The arugula was a great addition to the burger.

    "text": "My friends and I have decided to try out Gordon Ramsey Burger this weekend while we were in Vegas.  Host: 1 star  For anyone who is a first timer, parties of 3 or more do not need to wait in their line. You'll need to go to the host and tell them your name/number of people. They will ask for your number and send a text. Once when you get a text, you have 10 minutes to return back to the restaurant to get your table.   Initially, we had a group of 7 present, which we need to wait about 35-40 minutes. We then had an additional 3 more people added to our group, a total of 10. I went up to the host, Kelly (asked our server specifically what was her name just in case if she gave me a fake name), to change the number of parties. She again asked for my number but  I never received an updated text. I reconfirm with another female host and she also said they will resend a text. Guess what? My request was never on the books. We ended up with 7 people in one table and the other 3 had their own table on the other side of the restaurant. This service is not acceptable.   Food: 5 stars  Highly recommend: TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES  Burgers do not come with fries. We've ordered truffle French fries, ahi tuna sliders, hellfire chicken wings as appetizers. I've ordered a crown burger, super delicious!   Server: 5 stars  We had great service from our server. She was very organized and friendly. Food came out quick.   Would I return to this restaurant? Yes  I understand that the awaiting guests may be overwhelming to the hosts but this type of service is unacceptable. People come to the restaurant because of Gordon Ramsey. The service may just be ruining it.",

About an hour and 15 mins we received a text saying our table is almost ready start to head over so we did.

This place was horrible. Can't believe I waited an hour to eat at this place when there were so many other options, it is Vegas. First the fries.. ordered extra crispy and when the food runner brought it out we asked if it was extra crispy and she was like sure. Then when we tried it, it was all soggy and def not crispy. Server came to check saw it wasn't right, took it away and brought us a new one. Same thing, no flavor and barely fried. Burgers.. there were 8 of us so we got to try everything from the lobster to the regular burger. Not sure if it all sat there a while before getting to the table but even the center of the meat was cold. The buns was stale and cold, probably didn't even get toasted. Not sure why this place had high ratings maybe cause of the name? However we won't be coming back.",

Not a \"giant\" selection but what you should expect from a renowned chef.   I had the Hog Burger and can say it's one of the best and unique burgers I've had. Made with a pork patty, bacon and other delicious ingredients and a great bun, definitely a great burger. My girlfriend had the blue cheese burger and it didn't disappoint. We shared a batch of salt and vinegar crisps, very good and unique.   There is usually a wait so be prepared. It's in a busy casino so be prepared. It's likely that Gordon won't be there so be prepared.   Service did not disappoint and the prices are consistent with strip celeb chef places but worth it. I will go back. Passed it last time I was in Vegas and will try something different.",

Sat down right away with a 30+ minute wait. The bartender staff here is really on it and the service I received was outstanding. I decided on the Hell's Kitchen Hamburger which consisted of asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeno served protein style. My only dock of this place in a time and era of people not wanting to eat tons of bread learn how to properly protein wrap a burger. Throwing a piece of butter lettuce on the bottom and one of top isn't cutting it. What was cutting it was the flavor of this burger. Thank you for asking how I like my burgers cooked and actually delivering on it. This burger was cooked to a perfect medium with just the right amount of pink. Also the other combination of flavors where down right delicious! I also against my better judgement ordered the beer battered onion rings. My body said no but my taste buds said yes and my hunger. These onion rings are probably the best I have ever had. Served with parmigiano-reggiano cheese AMAZING! served with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip AMAZING! I really loved eating here and would for sure be back again...",

Well, considering it's Gordon Ramsay and location, it's pretty good.  One downside is, if you got seated next to casino, you may smell cigarette.   The Backyard Burger is very good especially with grilled onion. It is worth the $15 price tag.    Service was good, it took a bit to get burgers but it's fair amount of time due to they had to cook them like regular dish",

We then ordered the HOG DAWG, cheese on the side, the Crown burger, medium, unfortunately it was not as good as we expected. For it to be cooked medium, it actually looked really rare. Meat was not flavorful and was actually a little dry. I know that sounds weird but it really was. The truffle fries and onion rings were good. Both were crispy and the fries were made better with the parmesan and truffle. The hog dawg was delicious though. Well, it was wrapped in bacon and then there was pulled pork on top of it. Made my mouth water as I prepared to eat it. The place itself is clean but a little cluttered with so many tables and chairs. Waitress provided good service. I was shocked when I looked at my bill and they charged $4 for a slice of avocado. Wow! I would not return here, even though the hog dog was good.",

    "text": "Great place to get some stunning burgers. I've been here three times and I've never been disappointed by the burgers or entrees.   One thing I must say about the chips (French fries) is that they can be so hard or stale sometimes. I'm not sure if this is affected by when I go in (the later I go in, the more stale the chips get), but it's a bit annoying because I love having fries with my burgers. The sauces are good but I would love some more universally friendly versions of them. I know the curry sauce had a very overwhelming spice to it.   The burgers are good. The salad (pictured) is also great. It's Gordon Ramsay, what else do you expect?   The only reason why I took two stars off was because the service is always sooooooo slow. I don't get it. I understand that it'll get a little slower when it's busy, which is fine, but even when it's not and there's barely a line, my server will always forget something or take forever to check up on me.   Otherwise, it's a great burger joint. Maybe avoid the fries if you can? Breading on the onion rings were stellar!",

There was a long wait, which we were prepared for, since they don't do reservations. Then we started with the kettle chip nachos which just did not turn my crank for lack of a better phrase. They were so average. It tasted like I took lays chips from the store and cheese and threw it together myself! Then we ordered our burgers and fries. The truffle parmesan fries were no truffle & all parmesan. As if you just cut potatoes and sprinkled a bunch of parm on them- just not a great taste to be honest. As for my very simple backyard burger.. it tasted EXACTLY like Shake Shack- and if that's your thing, do yo thang. But I'm an In N Out girl! So I would have rather payed for that and had a better experience than come here. My boyfriend loved the Hog Burger though, which I was happy about! Subsequently, the walk from the parking garage here is really long. Be prepared!",

Made from mangalitsa pork which is probably some divine pig in Europe. Also I'm not a fan of coleslaw but it totally works on this hog monstrosity. If there's one downside to this place it's their ketchup and if Gordon Ramsey told me I was swine not good enough for the hog burger I wouldn't disagree. I have my taste though and Heinz would be much better on their fries than the in house ketchup they serve. We opted for regular fries but the parmesan truffle fries are great too next time we come back we'll try out the sweet potato fries, yes there will be a next time. Oreo cremebrule shake is great give that a try too if you love sweet treats.",

The fry's has zero salt on them and overcooked a touch.

Twenty minutes later we got it. That wasn't all.

This review is about his burger restaurant at Planet Hollywood though.   I arrived around 11:45 and there was no line.  I stood in front of the hostess stand about 5 feet away and looked for room at the bar.  There wasn't room, so I patiently waited in front of the hostess stand.  I was ignored for 30 minutes as the line started piling up. I asked the hostess if I could sit at the bar and she told me to get in line. I explained to her that I had been waiting right there the entire time and she rudely told me that I had been waiting in the wrong place. I get it, Gordon Ramsay is a famous chef, but have some common sense and don't ignore people who are obviously waiting for a seat. The arrogance and rudeness was unbelievable.    Luckily there are tons of burger places on the Vegas strip and I found a great burger elsewhere. This just goes to show that you can slap a well know name on anything and get away with a sub par product. Get a clue and focus on your service rather than just banking on a famous TV persona.    Shameful.",

When I inquired about bar seating, I was told by the three hostesses to wait in line for a place at the bar...that they would come and get me as soon as a place was free. After 25 minutes, 4 places opened. I waited and watched the 3 hostesses laugh and chat with each other while the four spots remained empty. 10 minutes (yes I timed it) and I decided to tell them places were available.  They laughed and pointed to the bar saying I should go sit. When I said they SAID they'd come and get me, they giggled and said \"you can have a seat\". Unbelievable.  Many tables empty with a line of 20 people waiting. I have no problem waiting but when there are at least 5 tables, 4 bar stools available...and the hostesses are ignoring us...something needs to be done. Now onto the food! I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and truffle fries.  Both were delicious.  I expected the burger to be thicker bit it was really good. Bar staff were attentive and friendly.  I'd have given 5 stars except for the hostesses...who still haven't sat people at  3 empty and clean tables (and I'm only giving a quick glance) to the people waiting.",

It's one of their specialties! The lobster and shrimp patty was so fresh and freaking delicious. The truffle fries were good but the sweet potato fries were even better. It had a nice crispy texture with powered sugar! Also, if you get the lobster and shrimp burger be aware that the pickled veggies are kind of spicy because there are jalapenos in it! Besides that, its definitely worth trying and the service was great!",

I shared the farmhouse burger, an alcoholic beverage with blueberries (sorry can't remember the name of the drink), truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and hot dog. All I have to say is the service and food were awesome. The servers were very attentive and fast. The quality of the ingredients used to make the burger was unbelievable. I love how balance the flavors were and how it was not over seasoned. The burger meat had a nice crest on the outside and cooked all the way through but the patty was still very juicy. The fries were great. There was nothing special about the hot dog but I had to try it since we're already there. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. I almost forgot, the drink I had was awesome. It was very light and refreshing. I would order it again.",

    "text": "We came last night after trying Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris hotel. We only waited about 15 minutes for a party of 2. We came with high hopes and left extremely disappointed after the service we received. We both have worked in the service industry for years so maybe we were a bit critical but this bordered on ridiculous.  After 12 minutes of being seated, our server  greeted us with \"Did you decide what you want yet?\"   Not a hello, not a \"welcome, have you been helped?\"..poor server looked bored and tired. With an unapproachable demeanor she made us and apparently her other tables look a little hesitant to ask questions. We ordered water and cocktails, but our water glasses were empty for 25 minutes and cocktails didn't arrive until our food did.   Appetizers arrived briefly, chips and curry were slightly cold but good.   A whole 45 minutes later our burgers arrived. The meat was delicious and the flavors mixed perfectly, but the server never checked up on us after we started eating. Server was no where to be found when we wanted some limes, and only saw her maybe twice the whole evening.   We had to remind her several times to refill our water, and at the end of the meal when we asked for a box she looked at me as if I spoke to her in an alien language.   If you want to truly experience Gordon Ramsay: try the steakhouse and their amazing beef Wellington and ask for Victor, he will treat you like a proper server should and make sure your experience is worthwhile. You won't wait nearly and hour for your food and you'll leave fat and happy.",

Look to pay at least 30 or more per person if you want a burger, fries and a drink. Burgers are approximately $16 each and fries are $8 on up. It's definitely a great place to try if you haven't been. Ask for your burger to be cooked well, if you don't want any pink.",

Btw Gordon Ramsay has like 4 restaurants on the strip. We figured we would give Chef Ramsay's burger place a shot.   We came on Monday night and there was no wait for a table. But according to the server sometimes the wait is two hours!! I ordered the UK burger which had arugula, Dubliner cheese and a mango chutney. I prefer my burger or meat to be close rare. The server asked how I would like my burger I told her MEDIUM RARE BUT MORE RARE. She took my order and my hubby's and friends' orders. My friend wanted to modified or substitute an item. The server was nice about it but she did explain that the chefs are picky about modifications they usually DO NOT do stuff like that. But she would ask anyway and the chefs refused. So orders were finally placed. We waited 30 MINUTES!! Still NO burgers in sight!!! We asked our server about our food. She said it's a standard 30 minutes. She could tell we were irritated. She felt that management should post it somewhere but of course they wouldn't!!  Our food finally came out 5 minutes later.   The burgers and fries (btw everything is al la carte) looked good. We were starving too!! My girlfriend order her burger medium. When I cut into my burger my patty was medium well. My girlfriend's burger was more rare and she ordered medium! I was upset!! Not only did we wait 30 MINUTES plus, the chefs DID NOT ALLOW CUSTOMIZED BURGERS and this place's speciality is burgers and they STILL COULDN'T get it right!!!! The burger had good flavor but the patty was OVER COOKED and DRY to me. For almost $20 this burger should be magically! It's was the cheese and chutney that saved it.   I told the server my issue of my overcooked patty. And of course when you're a vegetarian YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD!! I don't know why the server felt it was necessary to tell me she doesn't have issues with overcooked meat because she's a VEGETARIAN!!! *hand clap* very helpful you millennial! I told her I didn't want to wait 30 minutes again because I was hungry. I asked her what can she do for me. So she said she would check with her manager. She returned and gave us 10% off the bill. Thank you millennial vegetarian working at a burger joint! *thumbs up*  SUMMARY  PROS: the mango chutney  CONS: LONG wait for just the food, self righteous vegetarian server, OVERCOOKED DRY PATTY  LAST THOUGHT: Chef Ramsay would shame this restaurant and staff! Never returning!",

The food took over an hour to get, all the burgers were over cooked, eggs were over cooked, onion rings were cold, all this and we waited an hour. In the hour we waited we didn't see our server at all. No drinks ever showed up that were ordered with the meal nor were refills provided during the entire meal. The bill came and since it was 12 of us we had him split on 2 cards. I realized he never gave me a receipt for one of the cards. I brought it to the managers attention, they proceeded to argue with me about it. I could have just walked out and they wouldn't have been paid, but I did the honest thing and tried to explain to the server and manager that they hadn't run the card and if they did I had no receipt. They argued and we finally resolved the issue and they ran my card. What gets me is that here's a celebrity chef who talks about kitchen nightmares yet his own restaurant was a nightmare. Went to Bobby Flays Burger Palace the next day and it was phenomenal at half the price! #bobbyflaybeatgordonramsey",

They both come with 2 flavorful sauces that will blow your mind. Whiskey lemonade and Caribbean Dreams to accompany the meals were awesome and refreshing.  If you get there when they are opening don't panic at the huge line- it moves fast and the food is very much worth the wait.  Server was excellent. They are quick service and delivery, but you don't feel rushed out the door.  The atmosphere is casual and fun and the food presentation is on point! Fire feature adds a lot to the experience.

The line getting into the restaurant was long, super long actually, we waited for roughly over an hour to get into the restaurant.   So overall the experience was good, I'd rate the experience an easy 4 stars out 5. It was a few hours later in the day that made my rating drop to a 2 star rating when I was sick with food poisoning in my hotel room bathroom on the first day off my trip.   It was an unfortunate experience that I wish didn't happen because I quite enjoyed the burger, but with this being a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant I was really let down that i got sick from eating there.",

The meat had no real flavor of its own and you could hardly taste the blue cheese. I can see now why the waiter was pushing hard for fried onions and bacon on everyone's burgers since by themselves they tasted  like they were missing something. My friend ordered an egg on his \"Anniversary Burger\" and it came with a half inch piece of shell in it. The waiter apologized but then only reimbursed the charge for adding the egg. Poor customer service move.   One positive was the delicious Poutine we ordered for an appetizer. That was done extremely well. Overall, this place is not worth the wait or the money.",

The experience was what you would expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The presentation was spot on. The cook on the meat was perfect. It was juicy without being messy. Everything was perfectly seasoned. The waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable and the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.",

    "text": "This is a hard one. Am I grading it for the food or for the experience? Eating at any Gordon Ramsay restaurants is always an experience..the decor, ambience, and crowd make everything so much more exciting. Of course, the service is amazing, even for a place that serves burgers. The burgers are reasonably priced, but the fries and onion rings are a bit expensive. I ordered the truffle fries as well as the Farmhouse burger while my wife ordered the blue cheese burger. They were both good, but is it much better than Inn and Out, Ilands, or Red Robin? I'm not so sure. At least I couldn't tell a big difference. I think Red Robin's onion rings are much better. Overall, it's still a great restaurant if you just want to eat burgers, munch on some bar foods and chill out with some friends without going out to a fancy restaurant. For #Thinsulin fans, you can eat the burgers without the buns but you'll probably want to order two if you want to be full.",

Before my flight I got here shortly after they opened and was offered a nice table for one. The service was very slow to start but after my order was taken, things definitely improved. I started with a glass of prosecco and settled on the Hell's Kitchen burger medium rare. The burger was absolutely delicious and the meat almost melted in my mouth. I'm pretty sure I scarfed down my burger so quickly and with so much pleasure that people at an adjacent table asked me which burger I was eating haha. The jalapeno peppers and aioli combined with the avocado and toasted tomatoes made for quite a delicious combination. I normally only eat half of my burger buns but with this one, I didn't leave a single crumb of bread left. 2 glasses of bubbly and this burger definitely made me a happy camper on the flight.",

Service was up to par with your regular everyday restaurant but not in a bad way. The food though, tasted great. Try the Nachos, the sauce is amazing. Forget what type of fish but they have some fish sliders that are good. My wife had a turkey burger with a crazy name in menu and it was really tender and juicy. I had a regular burger and definitely  better then your regular everyday burger you could find elsewhere. Butter pecan milk shake was really good. Overall if you walk in with super high expectations then you're probably going to be let down.",

Tried the Fish and shrimp burger. Pretty good. I say that because there was a sweetness to it that I'm not fond of. But great taste of fish and shrimp. The shrimp and fish were ground into a patty which worked well. Overall the atmosphere was buzzing and the staff was friendly.

Especially with the name of Gordon Ramsay and being impressed with his Pub location in Casaers, we decided to check this place out.   At 3pm, there was a decent line outside the location. I thought it was kinda odd since we eat early to avoid the lines but maybe that is a good sign. Finally, we made our way to the front and the location was not filled to capacity. Why we waited, I have no idea but will learn why later as dinner progressed.   Our server was very friendly so that is a huge positive. She took the time to explain a few things and was very bubbly. There was probably the only biggest positive there.   My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and I ordered a creme brulee milkshake. They both were amazing. And we ordered the duck poutine. The fries took about 20 minutes and they were fairly good. It came with duck bacon, the sauce had good flavor and depth. But the fries had a little grittiness to it. I dont think they washed the potatoes because it was almost like a small grains of sand. Very disappointed in that. As someone who once worked in fine dining... how could you miss an important step like that?  After an hour upon sitting down, our burgers did not arrive. We were finished with the fries (which I hoped would be enjoyed with the burger but as I slowly ate it... it was finished a long time ago) and we sat there talking and waiting. You look around and everyone has the same sad face of \"Where is my food?????\"  Finally, after over one hour..the food finally arrived. By now, my food has expanded so I am not that hungry anymore. My girlfriend ordered the Hog burger which came like 1 foot tall. I remember a clip of this shows of \"How do I even eat this burger? Its so damn bloody big\". Well, he probably didnt say that word from word but close enough. We wondered the same thing. You couldnt smash it down but you couldnt eat it like a normal burger. The Hog burger was mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw.  I ordered the \"Foie\" Burger which had pate foie gras (spread), chevre, port wine aioli, frisee. It had a decent foie spread but at the same time, it was a little tangy from the aoili. It was slighty more on the tangy side so it could put down some people who dont like that flavor contrast. Luckily, my burger was manageable and it really did come out medium rare like I requested. At least they did something right.   Overall, the server was great, the food was decent and the wait was horrible. I do not think I would return to this location when I am back in Vegas. Instead, I may check out his Steakhouse or go back to the Pub location.",

    "text": "To sum it up - my second visit here with the wife was False hope for quality - with the visit being saved by the shake.   Second visit for me to Vegas and Gordon Ramsay burger joint and the atmosphere is great, starting with the flame wall at the entrance.   My last memory from 2 years ago was amazing. I was expecting the same quality. Having been at Gordon's steakhouse the night before, our expectations were high. We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries. The wife has a cocktail (signs of alcoholism for sure ;) - and I ordered the brown butter caramel shake.   The fries came out first, we were very hungry and the fries were excellent. The truffle Parmesan fries were square cut and crunchy with a hint of shaved Parmesan on top. The dipping sauce was amazing - some kind of mayo rendition with some type of peppers. The sweet potatoe fries were thinner cut and crunch - absolutely to die for. They had a touch of powder sugar on top, as well as some on the side if you wish to add more. The dipping sauce was a jalapeno custard mayo type of sauce and is the perfect companion to the sweet potato fries.   A few minutes later, the burgers showed up. This is where the disappointment happened. Gordon and staff - if you ever read this - I suspect you take quality very seriously and I'm not sure if this was a one off or what but the burger was atrocious - almost not edible. It was overly salty, the bun was stale and overall over cooked (we both ordered medium). Wife and I both cook, and we would not want to serve anyone that type of quality.   Having ordered the shake, they must have forgotten it. The server apologizes and is in awe why it was not brought out already. She proceeds to bring it in a to go cup. Man, I am glad she did. It was perhaps the tastiest sweet item we've had in Vegas all week ( the desert at Gordon's steakhouse is top notch). The brown butter and pecan were rich and creamy - it does not let you put it down no matter how full we were. We were upset we didn't go back later that evening for a second round.  In summary - the fries and shake were a solid A The burger, which is supposed to be a signature dish, was a complete failure. Shame on Gordon Ramsay and his staff for putting out such a terrible product. We may be back for the shake but doubt it for the food.",

With my wife we made an effort to get in line at 10:30am so we could be sat as soon as they open. When going here expect a wait. It is very popular and for good reason. It is located in Planet Hollywood on the north end of the casino.   Service was excellent both times. The burgers are extremely flavorful. The bun is delicious. There are many good options to choose from.   On my visit with my wife, Gordon himself actually stopped in. I was very impressed that the first thing he did was walk around and shake every single employee's hand and thank them. Clearly a good guy to work for if you do your job right.   Plan accordingly for the wait, and I think you will find this place to be worth it. Plus a 30 minute wait really is no big deal.",

    "text": "2017 Review 33/100  5 stars for some of the best food and best service I've ever received at a restaurant. I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan and this was my first time at one of his restaurants and I was very impressed.  The food was the shining star, as it should be. We had the hummus as an appetizer and W.O.W. It was probably some of the best - if not THE best - hummus I've ever had in my entire life, no exaggeration. After we finished the dish I immediately looked up Ramsay's recipe and I plan to make it very soon. Funny enough, neither of us ordered burgers and this burger joint. We had burgers for lunch so we were feeling something different. My friend ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca Sliders and I had the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad. Both were extremely good. And the burgers looked amazing. I really want to return again and try one. For desert, it was the Blood Orange Creamsicle. Tangy orange popsicle goodness with a creamy center. We also ordered drinks. I had the Skinny Screw and she had the Acai Lemonade. Again, very, very good.  Our waiter, Ryan, was the best. He was super personable and knew the menu extremely well so he was able to make some great recommendations on what to order. Since he seemed to be such a foodie we even asked him for a recommendation on where to go for breakfast the next morning and his recommendation did not disappoint (see my review for Mon Ami Gabi).  It's worth noting this place does not take reservations. You will have to wait in line to get a table. How long you have to wait just depends on the day and time you choose to dine here. We went on a weekday for a little bit earlier dinner and only had to wait about 15 minutes. But I have heard from others the wait can get up to 2 hours, so plan accordingly, particularly if you are catching a show afterward.  The hype is real and I highly recommend you add Ramsay's burger joint to your Vegas foodie \"to do\" list.",

No way they can be better than In-n-out's...  Anyways so one day i was strollin down the strip, it was around dinner time, stomach is getting a bit growly.. figured its time to find a bite to eat.. decided to stop by Planet Hollywood and chilll there for a bit.. enjoying that free AC while searching on Yelp for my next meal.. had this place bookmarked for the longest time so figured.. hey, im here, why the heck not!  i absolutely love the exterior of the restaurant, the highlight of it being the \"fire wall\".. just a really neat piece and great for photo ops.  The food here was amazing! its not comparable to In-n-out, being that these are gourmet burgers.. but they are definitely worth the price you will be paying for these bad boys.. you really cant go wrong with any of them.. but their most popular one is definitely their Truffle Burger which was DELICIOUS!!!  INSIDER TIP!!! ORDER THAT MILK SHAKE TO WASH IT ALL DOWN!!  No lie, my favorite item i got here was their milkshake, their custard, creme brulee with oreo to be exact. it will cost you around $11 but it was one of the most satisfying shake i have ever put  in my mouth!",

The nachos were exceptional and I don't think that I've ever had nachos this delicious or as absolutely smothered in creamy delicious cheese.   I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it couldn't have been more perfectly made. I would love to criticize Gordon Ramsay and one of his establishments but it truly was incredible.   If you have a chance, it's not above the hype. It is what you'd hope for and they do it well. I highly recommend and would take the wait. They don't have a really large \"waiting \" section so you might be standing. It is important to note that if you're platinum or diamond they'll let you in EARLY!",

They had some very unique red wine mayo too which I recommend you try- Ive never tasted anything like it before!   The wait was about 20-30 mins in line for a party of 2.

Service was pretty spot on except they never offered to refill his iced tea and I saw our waitress bring other tables a second drink. The price for what you got was high but not so much considering it is Vegas. I got the lobster and shrimp burger and it was great. He got the Stout burger and enjoyed it but didn't wow him. I felt the burgers were busy. Even the buns had seasoning. Sometimes less is better. We also had the truffle and Parmesan fries. They were good but steak fries are not my favorite with a burger. It was a nice meal but I would try another burger place if I came back.",

    "text": "In 9 years of being on YELP I have NEVER written a bad review for a restaurant, but it is virtually impossible to allow what happened last night go without review.   Around 9pm we arrived at Gordon Ramsay's Burger. The line was about 20-25 mins long. We let the hostess staff know that my father was in a handicap scooter and would need something other than a high top because he can not get out of his scooter because of his muscular disease. As we arrived to the front of the line there were numerous tables of four where he could have pulled his scooter up to. They told our party of 3 that they could not do that because his scooter would block the walkways (this was a ridiculous statement because many of the tables were in a space with very amble moving around space). So I suggested that since there are three of us only that we could remove two chairs on one side, he could then move his scooter sideways near where the two chairs used to be (his scooter chair can turn to face the table). They said they could not move the chairs.   Their solution was that there are TWO tables to the left when you enter and we can sit you there out of the way (now if you have made it so anyone with a handicap scooter must be out of the way then why are you not reserving these tables for people with actual handicap related needs). There are literally only TWO tables there that they claimed were available for handicap people who cant get out of their scooters. They said well we can have you wait until one of those people leave. They did not tell us when we first came up that we would be waiting for only two tables which could have taken another 30+ mins to leave (above the original wait). What was absolutely even more astonishing was the rudeness of the girl at the hostess stand looking at me and arguing that moving two chairs would have been too much of a hassle for them. When I argued that it would not be any trouble or blocking of walkways to just please move the chairs, their manager Ryan approached us. He realized that moving two chairs was not that large of a trouble and moved the chairs so that our original request would be met. We waited a long amount extra, received an incredible amount of attitude and rudeness from the hostess, as well as what seems to be a general discriminatory attitude to those who have a handicap.   Las Vegas is frequented by people with handicap needs. It happens to be one of the most handicap friendly cities in the world. We have ate at this exact restaurant in the past and the prior staff moved chairs and made it very simple to eat there with a handicap issue. The staff last night not only embarrassed my father, they were disrespectful, unable to think about a simple solution, and when a simple solution was presented to them they simply refused to help. I urge someone with some ability to make changes at this restaurant to read this review and put into place some serious safeguards in place for this sort of situation. As a multiple business owner I would be appalled if any client of our businesses was treated the way that your restaurant treated my father last night.",

    "text": "What can you say wrong about Gordon Ramsay or anything branded his name? First off, impressively over the top window display of a rollercoaster of fire  (its Vegas, are you even surprised?) and of course we have Mr Ramsay himself posing, that definitely will having you \"caption this\" while you're munching on your burger (I came up with \"now that's a f?#kin burger, don't forget about it chap!).  What is there to order ? Well it's burgers with fancy buns served with glorified sides , not a lot of cooking knowledge needed, except...foreign cheese names. I suggest you google as you go down the menu to educate yourself because I have to say, there's a method behind the success of GR. If you are someone who's into classic burger spots this ain't for you, but if you are hungry walking the strip and got $30 (on average) to burn, try it out. Look, you won't get a greasy burger with a bun soppin with butter (still sooo damn good) but what you will get is a clean presentation that is well structured with the freshest ingredients you can ask for. You can walk away from here and say \"wow I actually feel good\" instead of hating yourself for consuming some burger monstrosity. So if you are fancy, appreciate different European cheeses , fresh ingredients and a not so greasy burger in a picturesque bun, throw your money here...plus they stay open late so there's a perk you can't pass on",

The burger never stood a chance with me it didn't last too long in my hands either. The table prep was extremely attentive to us and made us seem highly important. It seemed as if our glasses got low he was always aware of the levels of the glass  The one problem that we did see is the waiter wasn't really there for us, we waited a little while just to receive a hello let alone fill our order. He didn't even stop by after our meal came to ask how everything was going. But we just ignored him also as we ate our great meal, and we enjoyed every second of it. I would run back to GRB, to try other meals, and I will continue to dream about how amazing that burger was. Definitely will be back!!!",

We were able to get a table without reservations after a moderate wait, only 30 minutes. Which is to be expected with a place this popular.   The drink menu was creative and delivered the flavors promised  There was nothing tricky about it but in hindsight, I should have just gone with a beer.   We ordered poutine and onion rings to get things started. The onion rings were amazing. Usually onion rings go limp and soggy almost immediately but these held up.   The poutine, however, was just a mess of flavor. Poutine is simple. Fries, brown gravy, cheese curds and optional meat. This was needlessly a complicated dish that tried too hard and was a disappointment.   The burgers served up were delicious but the entire table I was with ordered them cooked the same way, medium rare, based on our servers suggestion. When they arrived, however, we had burgers that ranged from rare and almost blue to almost medium. I had one of the rarer burgers and while tasty, it just became a wet mushy mess a few bites in.   The service was great. The ambience was cool and what you would expect. It is a bit noisy and crowded but this is Vegas after all.",

The food was absolutely decadent. My husband and I shared the ultimate cheeseburger and onion rings. The burger was so fresh, the cheeses were tangy and smooth, and the sesame bun was toasted to perfection. We were happy we decided to add bacon to the burger, it was perfectly crisped and had great smoke flavor. The onion rings were breaded perfectly and served with a chipotle ketchup that is out of this world! The ranch sauce with the rings was good too, but the ketchup was a nice spicy treat for the ol tastebuds.",

I don't necessarily think the hostesses handled this in the most efficient or friendly manner, especially for there being 4 of them.  4 employees to do one job and to do it poorly, kinda weird.      The great thing is that you forget about this pretty quickly after you sit down.  Excellent menu with thoughtful creations and options for everyone.  What I loved is that from the fries, to the onion rings, to the dipping sauces, to the burger and every component on the burger....all thoughtful.  All tasty.  This is not a place that serves Heinz with his hand battered onion rings or raw onions with their pork burger.  All components are thoughtful and delicious and that's what makes this a stand out, gotta return, Ramsay name worthy establishment.   Go!  You'll enjoy your meal here.  Trust.",

I am not a fan of onions in any way, shape or form, but these onion rings were BOMB. The truffle Parmesan fries, tho it sounds about pricy at $12, came in a huge serving size and were also terrific. And finally.. I got the tandoori chicken burger. This was probably one of the best chicken burgers I've had in my life (and I've had a lot b/c I'm not a big red meat fan).  Other than the fantastic food, the customer service was on point even on a busy weekend night. We actually had a 1hr wait to get seated, but we didn't mind it since there were lots to do around & we were notified when it was our turn. I would absolutely come back here again.",

There is always a line no matter what time of the day.  So expect a wait.   The wait time isn't too bad since there is a lot of things to do at the hotel while you are waiting.  Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, its always a good time to stop by for a quick bite anytime.  They serve gourmet burgers, fries, sandwiches, and shakes.   The ambience is modern and hip which you can either get dressed up or casual depending on the occasion.  The staff is friendly and always checks in to make sure you are enjoying your experience.    Food also was served fresh and fast.   We didn't have to wait long before our food arrived.   I highly recommend trying the turkey burger, sweet potato fries, and truffle parmesan fries.  I normally don't like sweet potato fries.  But it is so amazing  It was hot, fresh, and served with a homemade garlic aioli sauce.     Overall, it was a great experience.  I would highly come back again and try different food on the menu.",

    "text": "Who comes to Gordon Ramsay Burger and doesn't get a burger? I do! Haha well, my friend Tony did but he inhaled his food so quickly that I couldn't even snap a pic.   This is my third time in Vegas and second time here. I just knew it was going to be one of my many stops. We stood in line for about 10 minutes before we were seated so the wait wasn't too bad.   Now, before I get carried away I want to say that if you are looking for a cheap, or even slightly affordable place to eat/drink, look elsewhere as GRB is anything but. I imagine 70% of the people who come here on are some sort of vacation so they don't mind the splurging because that's exactly how you will feel when you see the prices.   I didn't even bother ordering food due to the huge meal I ate at the airport, so I knew I was only getting some drinks. I asked our waiter what he recommends, and he said a Long Island, which of course is one of my faves so I ordered TWO! He called them a Strong Island, and Let me just say they were strong enough to knock you off your feet. After running my mouth for another 30 mins or so I ordered a cranberry vodka which was strong too. It seems everyone has a heavy hand here but I'm not complaining.   Although I cannot remember our waiters name for the life of me, I LOVE a person who circles back and constantly asks me if I need something. It annoys a lot of people but I'm all for it. Bug and bother me because I would rather not have to hunt you down for another water or something, so I appreciate the attentiveness.   Gordon Ramsay has at least three more restaurants here in Vegas that I have to check out but I will circle on back this way to really dive into the menu because by the looks of things everything looks delicious.",

While all the servers were very pleasant the approach at the restaurant feels a quite rushed - they take the order and bring the food but getting something in between is a HUGE effort to just get their attention.  this place is VERY busy so this is part of it, but it's also just how they do it there.  It's a very well oiled machine the amount of people they are able to get in and out with such good food.  A little more attention in between delivery of food and exit would be my only request.",

No offense to buffets, but that meant I never got a chance to try all the amazing restaurants Vegas has to offer. Let's start with Gordon Ramsey's Burgers inside Planet Hollywood. The wait line for a table can get pretty long for dinner, but even then it didn't take as long as I would have expected. The burger was huge and juicy. Add the egg if that's an option you like. It was worth the wait. The truffle fries were some of the best I ever had. I'm not a big burger fan but sometime, I crave this place.",

The burgers are pricier and a la carte. I think the price does not match the quality of the product in my opinion. I got a burger with a subbed impossible patty. The impossible subbed patti was $7.  They really don't have options for vegetarians otherwise without paying a lot extra. We all ordered burgers besides me and we all thought they were extra dry. There was no flavor whatsoever. I would say it was the driest least flavorful burger I have tasted which is disappointing. My friend got the Parmesan fries and they were pretty basic as well.   My final bill was $30 with tip for just a burger and I would not return because it is not memorable.",

This is was a really exhilarating experience for me to meet people who have met Gordon Ramsay in person-- so you might say that I was \"overhyped\". Although the Hummus was great (although not as good as the stuff I ate at Israel), and burger was too, the Onion Rings and Garlic Fries really fell short. I tried to like them, and they got plenty of chances, but I couldn't really get into them-- I think they were too greasy. Also, the burgers we got (Backyard Burger and Hell Fire Burger) lacked sauce. Not sure if I just missed it or something, but I really felt like it could use it. The bill came out to $100, which is not horrible for Las Vegas. I thought that Mr. Ramsay was the best chef in the world, but I guess that even he has his fare share of problems.",

They had tuna, guacamole, crispy onions and some sort of spicy sauce. I loved the combination of crunch, creaminess and spice that worked throughout everything.   Truffle fries were not cooked well. I had some that were still raw, some that were soggy/mussy and a few that were edible. I ended up pouring them onto my plate trying to find enough to eat. These were expensive and not worth it. This is a burger place, you'd expect the fries to be perfect! Sauces were also not up my alley, flavor wise.   Service at the bar was lacking. The bartenders seemed more interested in talking with each other then providing a decent service. No one checked on me after my food arrived, I was never asked if I wanted anything other to drink besides water and when I asked to pay the bill the bartender threw the receipt/card in my direction without much anything else.  I love GR but I think he would be disappointed to know how the food at this restaurant is being represented. You want a good GR food experience, go elsewhere like GR steak (Paris) or GR fish and chips (Linq promenade).",

    "text": "TLDR: Did not live up to the \"Gordon Ramsay\" expectations...   When I was planning my trip to Las Vegas, one of the things that I had on my \"to do list\" was to visit one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. As the hotel that my friends and I (a group of 10) stayed in was near the Gordon Ramsay's Burger, we decided to give that a try (it was also the slightly cheaper option to his other restaurants). We arrived just before it opened on a Sunday lunch hour - the line was decently long, but we were able to get seated fairly quickly (about a 15 minute wait). While standing in line, we were able to view the menu, which contained a variety of different dishes - but hey, I'm at a burger place, so I have to try the burger!   I ordered the \"Hells\" Kitchen Burger ($17), which consists of asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes and jalapeno aioli - I got the patty medium well. I also ordered a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($12). Let me start off by saying, the wait was horrendous... when we asked our server why the burger took so long, she advised that the kitchen can only make/cook 10 burgers at a time... but for a restaurant this size and the amount of people that are being served, you would think that the kitchen should afford to make more than 10 burgers at a time - but I understand there must be a reason behind it. Anyways, we waited about 30-35 minutes and the burgers finally came out - on its face, the burger looked amazing (I was also starving since I haven't eaten anything yet), then the truffle fries came out a couple minutes later.  Review of the \"Hells\" Kitchen Burger - very plain, not a lot of taste. Also, my stomach instantly reacted to it... I guess I should've ordered the patty well done - but I could not finish more than half a burger before feeling awful.   Truffle Fries - this was good when hot, but it got pretty sickening after a while - I could only have so much fries (just get it to share).  Overall, because of my stomach reaction, I can't say that I will be coming here again...",

Our server, Christian, was super empathetic and kind right off the bat. He provided us a lot of insight on the menu but was also able to hold great conversations with us.   I asked for hot water with lemon (didn't ask for honey because I didn't want to be annoying) but he had asked if I wanted it anyway. Without even asking, he brings out two cold waters with no ice (because of our throats) and my cup of hot water with lemon and honey (which came in a cute li'l jar).   We ordered the ultimate cheeseburger and farmhouse burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries. The burgers were a great size and so were the fries. They were cooked exactly how we wanted and for meat lovers like my boyfriend and me, the two burgers came without any vegetables.   We also ordered the creme brulee cookies and cream shake. The shake was super delicious and creamy, while the creme brulee portion, which sat on top of the shake, was really light, fluffy and not too sweet. It was a great combination of the two.   Overall, our whole experience here had been amazing, from the service to the food, it was all so so great. I would definitely recommend coming here and trying everything because from what we have had so far I think that you can't really go wrong ordering anything on the menu.",

Second time that I go there the wait time was between 30 to 40min and I and my friends wait and we got a seat with 40min.  So, waiting time normally is the biggest challenge",

    "text": "Who doesn't know about Gordon Ramsay? When in Vegas, I felt that I just had to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and since it's conveniently located inside Planet Hollywood (not too far from where I was staying), I figured this was a good place to start. The wall of flames was definitely a cool thing to look at while waiting around.   The line.... Oh boy, there was a line when we came and there was an even longer one when we left. Luckily, there was a sign that told us parties of 3+ should see the hostess before waiting in line. This basically let's you get on their texting waitlist where you'll get a text as soon as a table is ready for you.  After we received our text, we were promptly shown to our table where we had Matt as our server. We asked him for his recommendations and he told us the popular choices: the Hog Burger and Hells' Kitchen Burger. We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries.   I hope you enjoy waiting, because if you didn't get enough of that before you got in, you'll get to wait some more for your food to come. It took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive. The burgers are tall and huge. Get ready for it to fall to pieces as you eat it.  Overall, the burgers and fries were very tasty. The Hog Burger was a bit salty, but I guess that's what you get with pork. I wasn't too fond of the long wait, but that's probably what happens when you eat at a popular place like this. Matt was a nice guy and constantly came by to check up on us.",

If you have a bigger party, you check in with the host and you'll be notified when your table is ready via text!   |Food| I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I thought it was good. It was pretty basic though. Just a regular burger, with avocado, and a piece of grilled jalapeno. I did not think it was spicy.   My table shared the fries and onion rings. The fries are really thick and not really special. It wasn't as crispy as I would preferred. It came with two unique sauces. For the onion rings, it was definitely different. I think they grilled the onions before they dunk it in the batter. The batter was very light! This also came with a sauce. The sauces were curry ketchup, chipotle ketchup, and cheddar ranch sauce. I loved the chipotle one!  |Service| Good! Server was helpful and great.  |Overall| It's worth a try if you're into trying one of Gordan Ramsay's restaurant without breaking your bank.. but I think it's still over priced for an average burger.",

If Gordon Ramsey was here he would say 'move your ass you stupid cow'. So I ordered hot wings which were very good. Balance hot with a mild sweet taste. Good flavor.  My burger after 25 minutes was dry average at best. I got the backyard burger which was a classic cheese burger with fixing only more expensive ($16). Very pricey  Outcome: I liked the wings but dry expensive burger are not my thing. My advice, Go to Five guys and take a picture of Gordon Ramsey with you. Then look at the picture as you eat a real juice classic American cheese burger.  Don't believe the hype. I will not be back here.",

    "text": "We have been back to Burger twice since my last review.  Wow, this place has changed from when it first opened!  Our last visit, was my wife and daughter coming through town on a summer vacation.  I was so excited to take our daughter, as I was bragging about the burgers and the fresh fries, as my daughter loves good fries!  FYI-she is a huge Five Guy's Fries Girl...  Anyways, I may have overplayed the fries at Burger, as we were very disappointed.  We noticed, before we were even served, that there were multiple orders of fries just sitting in the window, under the heat lamps, waiting for orders?  Yes, if I didn't know better, they were pre-making fries and holding them?  Anyways, the fries were like warm at best, soggy and very oily; not impressed.  What happened?    We were also very disappointed in the burgers, as they were served warm at best; not fresh off the grill piping hot, sorry.  I did try something different the last visit, by ordering the seafood/shrimp burger.  Big mistake, as it was like twenty bucks and tasted like old seafood, with a rubbery texture, not good.    As for the other burgers we ordered, they were both beef, and tasted better, but not great.  Again, the food was warm, not hot.  I also think they may have changed their supplier for their burger, as it really did taste like a lesser product than we had the first couple visits?  Sorry Burger, but I think you lost our business.  I am a big Gordon Ramsey fan, but think he is just starting to spread himself too thin, as I see the fall in quality...    I'm still a fan, please just don't lose that special touch that put you on the map!",

It's very spacious inside and although we got seated quickly, I could tell it was already very busy inside. We ordered the Hell's kitchen burger and hog burger. The food took very long to come out, but it was understandable since there were so many other patrons. Personally, I liked the Hell's Kitchen burger much better, but people have their own preferences. It was definitely tasty, but more on the expensive side for a burger. The presentation was nice and the patty was cooked perfectly to how I preferred. If you're in Vegas and you're feeling something kinda fancy, try this place!",

    "text": "I will gladly say that place did NOT disappoint. Upon walking in, I was super excited because obviously Gordon Ramsay but also because it's a simple burger shop. Of course he's known for more fine dining but I also know that he wouldn't just open a random burger shop so my taste buds were thriving with anticipation. I ordered the shrimp and lobster burger with onion rings and french fries. I kept debating on whether or not I should try poutine but I only have positive experiences with that dish upstate New York and Canada so I didn't want to risk it lol   Okay first, the onion rings literally dissolved in my mouth. Whether that's a good thing or not, they're definitely worth trying. I personally like my onion rings to have a thicker batter but paired with the BBQ sauce and ranch it wasn't too bad. They were also topped with parmesan cheese which made them pop. The steak potatoes fries were crispy and delicious. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the middle, just as I like them.   Now the burger. I order this burger simply because shrimp burgers are my favorite and I haven't had a good one since I lived in Louisiana. That said, WOW. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The shrimp patty mixed in with the chunks of lobster was an anomaly to my taste buds (a wonderful anomaly that is lol). Perfectly seasoned and paired with the pickled veggies and light greens, it did not need a sauce. The burger buns itself was buttered to perfection. Ugh. I loved that burger!  So if asked, whether or not I would go here again, the easy answer is yes, specifically for the shrimp and lobster burger. The Hells kitchen burger was good but I can get the same, if not better for a more reasonable fee. For the burger, the Hell's kitchen burger, fries, and onion rings, I spent $70.. I said $70. BUT Vegas is expensive so I want to say that's just the way the dice roll? For a cute, casual date this place is perfect atmosphere and menu considered,  or honestly if you just feel like splurging on an overpriced burger. GR did a great job.",

Food 5/5: I honestly believe that a burger or onion rings can't get any better. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The onion rings were evenly crispy throughout.    Atmosphere/Vibe 5/5: It was a fun, lively crowd. As I was waiting for my food, I noticed many soccer fans watching Mexico vs US on the monitors. Overall, customers were excited and in good spirits to be eating at such a well-known celebrity restaurant.     Price 5/5: For the quality of the burgers, the prices are more than reasonable. I will definitely come back.   Service/Cleanliness 3/5: Our server was excellent. He came to our table and refilled our drinks many times. However, the greatest drawback was our seating location. They sat us at the end of the restaurant right next to the pathway to the casino. There was a big cigarette tray/dispenser close to us that people walking by actively used. The smoke smell was off-putting, and I know better next time.   Tip: If you are a party of three or more, don't wait in the long line. Walk up to the hostess and give her your name and phone number. They will text you when your table is almost ready.",

The burgers here are really filling (and a little over priced) because it is a Gordon Ramsay stamped burger, but worth it if you a fan of him and burgers! (Pssst, it's literally the name of the restaurant.) The food is delicious as expected and the vibe is pretty cool. Even if you were to take his name out of the restaurant it would still be a pretty damn good burger. However, it can get a bit busy with delays in service dealing with a lot of people, but they are trying their best to accommodate.  I like to think that he is in the back yelling at the cooks to make it the right way--his way. Haha, one can imagine it happening, right?  Oh, and I recommend hitting up the Fat Tuesday for a good cold (and strong!) drink afterwards...or even before. It's Vegas after all.",

    "text": "I'll start this off my saying I don't eat meat. However, this place has a million options for vegetarians. You can get any of the burgers with a fake meat burger for an extra $6. The burgers are fairly expensive anyway, so I opted for the portobello mushroom burger ($18). I also tried out the truffle Parmesan fries. Food took probably 40 minutes to come out, but it was very busy and I would say the food was worth the wait.  Everyone at the table seemed to love their burger. The look deceptively small but were super filling. I didn't even get close to finishing it. The toppings on this burger all complemented it so well. My only complaint about it was that the mushroom could have been cooked a little more. I didn't really eat the are near the middle of the mushroom because it was too tough to chew through. The fries were awesome, I could eat them all day. I would definitely try this place again on future Vegas visits.",

There was quite a long line so make a reservation if you're able or you will be waiting to get in there.   I got the lobster and shrimp burger which I thought sounded gross but the people I was with were raving about it like it was the best thing ever so I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised that I really did enjoy it. As you can see if the picture mine kind of looks like it was poorly put together so I don't feel like I got a full bite with everything in it but it was still good.   *If you're watching your figure or keto they also have the option to get the burger as a lettuce wrap instead of bread*  We also got the truffle Parmesan fries to share and they were delicious. I'm not super into fries but I could've eaten all of them myself because of how good they were. They give you ketchup and an aoli for dipping. The aoli complimented the fries really well so I preferred it over the ketchup.   Service was good, our waitress had a smile on her face the whole time and was attentive. As far as burger places go this is a good spot to try!",

The wait was probably an hour, followed by a wait to get serviced as well. We settled for seats by the kitchen, and that wasn't very inconvenient. Our server was really sweet and friendly, but I think she had many more tables to tend to, that made the service slow.  I ordered the Hog Dawg, my friend got the Hell's kitchen burger with truffle fries. It took about 20-30 mins to get food. And it looked GORGEOUS! The Hog Dawg was divine. Every ingredient was cooked to perfection. The bacon wrapped sabrett, bbq pulled pork, the cheese, the butter, the onion rings- all sooooo good! My friend enjoyed his burger as well, and was very pleased to get a perfect Medium rare patty.  The truffle fries were good, especially the aioli dip with it. However, $12 is a steep pricetag for it.  Most burgers were $17-$19, with some specialty burgers more expensive.  I loved my experience here, other than the service which could be faster.",

However, once we sat, we waited a long time to be greeted. Once we were, service seemed to improve, although we did wait a long time for our food. The table next to us was seated well after us, ordered well after us, but got their food well before us. My burger was good, but I asked for it medium, and it was much more rare than that. My wife thought her burger was just fair as well. Onion rings and sweet potato fries were both great. I also really enjoyed my peanut butter stout beer. Very good after a hot day. In total, $120 seemed like a lot, but I guess it is Vegas. If it hadn't been so great last time, maybe my expectations wouldn't have been as high.",

    "text": "Ramsey lives up to all the hype!   Located inside a Planet Hollywood, the \"Forest Burger\" was beautiful on the plate and an even better bite.  Topped with sliced Duck Bacon, chunks of Tremor Cheese, Arugula, a variety of sauteed Mushrooms on a mixed Black and White Sesame Bun, this burger was really hard to put down.  The three-four slices of duck bacon itself were definitely ducky, not crispy but very lean.  There were at least two kinds of just sauteed perfectly, mushrooms that fell out of my burger while chomping, which I quickly were quickly scooped up and ate.  Finally the arugula added a slight contrasting bitterness.  The bun was toasted and aided with some truffle butter from the Truffle Parm Fries appetizer, this burger was perfect.  I was given a server recommendation that included the Hog Burger, but I wasn't disappointed and I'd have a hard time not ordering this again.  In fact all the burgers ordered in my party were great and well received, including the standard Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Cherry Pepper Chicken topped with an additional fried egg.  The Truffle Parmesan French Fries were a fantastic side.   Crunchy and salted, had me wanting more when done.  These fries were delivered in cone shaped plate with a ketchup and a truffle butter dip.  Every last bit of the truffle butter was used, with my fries, then in my burger.    The lines outside the door was pretty consistent even on a weeknight, if that matters at all in Vegas, I'd recommend coming at an off hour to get seated more quickly.  The service was fast and friendly.    This is a truly an all time awesome burger joint.",

    "text": "My wife and I were ecstatic to find this little gem in Vegas (located inside the mall- in casino- within Planet Hollywood). It can be quite the walk if you don't know where you're going.   However, although is says the environment is good for children, there is smoking galore, and the restaurant is open to it.   We had about a fifteen minute wait, and the hostess told us it would be another five minutes or so, if we could just wait back within the roped-in line we had just come from. Sure, no problem.   There were already people who gathered in that line, and because we had begun there, we simply stepped three feet to the side, so we weren't on top of anyone.   Because we weren't specifically in the square foot she was referring to, she took a customer who was behind us in line first.  She called us again to the counter in five minutes and said, \"the line is over there,\" again pointing to the line directly next to us.   We politely explained to her: \"We began there, and waited, and the line filled up, so we just stepped off to the side to wait.\"  She stared at me with a dumbfounded glare, and shook her head.   \"Um the line is there,\" shaking her head at us.  Well, it's not necessarily my favorite thing to be made to feel stupid from something so minute, when I'm first trying out such a popular restaurant.   The server who took us to our table was amazing, respectful, and kind. Although I was excited to experience the Gordon Ramsey atmosphere, the noise level was so high, we had to get our food to go.   We ate quietly in our car, and the food was amazing, unique, and delicious.",

There seems to be a long line for lunch and dinner, but if you have a party of 4 or more, they will give you a pager and you wouldn't need to stand in line.   The food was mediocre. To me, it was nothing more than an all-American burger joint with Ramsay's name (and price tag) attached to it. Burgers were about $17, which was not worth the money. The patty is a generous portion, so it's definitely possible to split a burger and order some gravy fries to share. Overall, we thought that the food was a bit too salty.  It was a fun experience to check out a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but would I come back again? Probably not...",

We opted to sit at a high top table.  I ordered the farm house burger. I really wanted the fried egg. I asked for my burger to be medium rare - basically red in the middle. It came more medium, pale pink the center. The burger was very tasty and well constructed.   My husband had the jalapeno burger. He ordered his burger medium. It came closer to medium rare. He felt there was too much jalapeno for him.  We also had the sweet potato fries. These were the best sweet potato fries! They were perfectly cooked and dusted with powdered sugar.    We also ordered the Oreo shake with 1/4 creme brulee. That was the right amount of creme brulee without it being overpowering. The shake was too thick for straws so we spooned it up. Delicious!  Service was very good. Our server was prompt and just attentive enough. Overall, it was a little spendy for burgers but very good.",

I complained to the manager on duty that they should post signs in front of their establishment about check-in procedures. They shouldn't put signs that aren't visible at the couples line.

Two stars because past experiences verify that IF you like meat, cheese and waiting far too long to be served, you'll definitely enjoy your burger.  Since the restaurant has a strict \"no substitutions\" policy, delivered with an unapologetic sneer, a vegan guest would have a hard time getting a burger worth $22+.  Good News: Ramsay Burger now allows guests to swap out any patty for Impossible Burger ($6 upcharge). The fries are usually quite good.  The Misses: No consideration that that any burger is already $16+, and that without the ability to change toppings or build your own burger, someone who doesn't want cheese, aoili or whatever else the kitchen decided you should enjoy, will end up with a rather plain expensive burger that isn't what you really want.  The beverage list is limited at best. And the staff...ugh. Just know that at this restaurant what you prefer, what you spend and how you are accustomed to being spoken to ... none of that matters here.  Strange that one of the most prolific chefs in town hasn't figured out how to swap toppings. Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay has it nailed. The service and beverage selection are superior there too. In fact...just go there!",

We decided to brave it on our last night at the hotel. We waited 45 mins. We had a view of the kitchen and were shocked to see a guy without a beard net on his beard.  Our waiter was friendly. There are lots of unique burgers to choose from. I wasn't feeling brave tho so I ordered the backyard burger. Hubby got the Hell's Kitchen burger. We also shared the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee on top. Unfortunately, fries don't come with the burgers, they are sold separately.  I got my burger cooked well done and hubby got medium. Two bites into my burger I realized that there wasn't any ketchup or sauce on it at all. It's also not provided at the table. I decided to roll with my sauceless burger and actually quite enjoyed it. The lack of ketchup and mustard allowed me to take notice and enjoy the flavour of the grilled burger and the delicious American cheddar cheese. I really enjoyed all the individual flavours.  Hubby was not blown away with his burger. He was expecting to have the best of the best and said it definitely didn't meet his expectations.  The milkshake was yummy and certainly big enough for the two of us.  Not very baby/stroller friendly.",

Their service is great, and it's definitely a casual place, but you can dress up and not feel out of place. The burgers are great! Oh, and the parmesan truffle fries are my favorite! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because I have kids, and there is not much on the menu for simple taste buds. I know, \"What are kids doing in Vegas???\", but as much as I don't like taking them to Vegas, they like going for the lights and nice rooms. So, we take the kids for dinner, because they need to eat too.  For parents: if you find yourself at Gordon Ramsey Burger, and you're with the kids, I would recommend the Chicken Sliders, just ask to get them plain. Also, wait times can be long. We waited 40 minutes for a table (5 people). Our last visit was Thanksgiving week, 2017.",

Pros: High-quality burgers, fries were amazing Cons: ridiculous wait time, pretty expensive  The wait is crazy. If you are not a Total Rewards member, it may not be worth it because depending on the day, you might have to wait up to two hours to get a table. When seated, the service does move pretty quickly. Our waiter was very nice even though he was handling like dozens of people.   At our table, we had the Hell's Kitchen burger, Portabella burger, and Backyard burger, and the Truffle Parmesan fries. All of the food was awesome. It's pretty pricey, and may not be worth it for some which is completely understandable. I don't think Burger is one of those \"must go to\" places in LV, but the food is still really good. Overall, I don't know if the food quality justifies the wait and the price but that's just personal preference!",

I got the portobello burger which has no meat but still cost $18. The mushrooms were horribly salty, also the menu said it had shaved veggies.....I can cut thinner veggies by hand at home. The waiter was nice enough to take my burger off the bill. He said they tasted the mushrooms in the back and in fact they were brined in a salt solution and that they were way too salty. All I could think of is what Gordon would have said, \"You served this to a customer?!\"  I will say the onion rings were light and crispy and not greasy....they were the best part of our meal.",

The wait was a bit long but it was still dinner hours so definitely understandable. The service was fantastic; the waiters walked us the through the menu and made sure that everyone was heard (we were a pretty sizable party). At one point, someone in my group shattered their water glass and the situation was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Moving onto the food, I had one of the specials which was a burger boasting three different kinds of pig and it was honestly one of the best burgers I'd ever had. Definitely really hearty and I wasn't able to finish it but I'd come again for another attempt. If you're going to come though, you have to try their shakes; in particular the creme brulee shake is to die for. I've recommended Burger to many of my friends and will be making stops here whenever I go to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This isn't a review of the food at Gordon Ramsay Burger - but rather my parties' experience - and specifically the customer service at this establishment.  My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating my 50th birthday with 2 other couples on 2/17/2018.  It was during the dinner hours and were happy that the wait for our party of 6 was only 30 minutes.  We were all excited to try his restaurant - having been fans of the TV program and having dined at another higher end Ramsey restaurant on previous business travel to Las Vegas.  Upon putting in our reservation at the hostess stand, we stepped to the bar, placed an order for 6 cocktails ($75 for the round of beverages), and began to watch the Winter Olympics on the TV at the bar.  After a few minutes a hostess approached my wife and explained that we couldn't stand were we were  (at the bar).  Upon surveying the area - I at first thought that the server was saying that we couldn't stand near the area of the bar where they pick up bar orders (i.e. near the rail) or we were in the way of the servers -- we were not.  I totally understand this -- so I made a point of moving down, making certain that we were well clear of the server area.  A few minutes later the server returned -- and very RUDELY told my wife and friends that we \"YOU NEED TO MOVE\"  (no \"please\" and in a very rude tone)  *** Important note *** several seats were EMPTY at the bar.   I explained we were having our drinks that we had just ordered -- and the server explained that it was \"against policy\" and that we would have to stand outside of the restaurant \"on the carpet\".  We walked back to the hostess stand --  I requested an explanation of the policy from the hostess and she reiterated the same.  Not satisfied with this, I requested to speak with the manager.  He came over - apologized, but said that was \"the policy\" -- the bar was \"full service\" and we would have to wait outside of the area.  I explained to him that I had just ordered a round of drinks and pointed out that ample seating was available -- I suppose I could understand if they had diners at the bar... but not really ... these weren't \"tables\" in the bar ... this was \"the bar\" -- and we were customers!  Unbelievable!   I explained to the manager that my friends and I were all frequent Las Vegas business patrons -- and didn't appreciate the terrible customer service.  Even if it was a \"policy\" - the server had no excuse to speak to my wife in such a rude and inappropriate manner.  He apologized for that (indicating he would speak to her) and offered to attempt to seat us -- but at this point I couldn't see giving the establishment another dollar.  Before leaving, I returned to the bar to put my $14 cocktails in \"go cups\" and the bartender also apologized for the policy.  Very unfortunate as I had enjoyed my other experience at GR restaurants - but given this experience will not return on future business or leisure trips.   I've been to many restaurant bars in my years of business and leisure travel -- but never experienced a policy like this - nor been treated so rudely.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants with exceptional customer service -  and we experienced several over our long weekend --- Gordon Ramsey Burger is not one of them.",

I ordered the hog burger and almost contemplated cutting it in half since it was so big. Quite delicious. I also ordered a side of fries. So damn good! Service was fast and friendly, the only negative I saw was wait staff appears to stand around a lot in the center of the room. I do not care for having the feeling that I am being stared at. Its just a bit awkward for me. Otherwise I highly recommend Burger and cant wait to go back and try something else from the menu. Its pricey but I feel the food was really worth what you pay for.",

It was moist, cooked perfectly (medium just how asked) and the bun was just the right amount of toasted. We also got the truffle fries which were delicious. The aioli that comes on the side is something you will just have to try! We will be back here again. The Only thing I didn't enjoy is that they didn't have any kind of kids options so our 4 year old helped us with the fries and had some crackers.",

After waiting a while, we got a new check with a minimal discount compared to the situation that we experienced.

Granted the restaurant is located in a prime location. So a slight wait is always expected.. From what I see on Chef Ramsay's show his tolerance for long wait times , cold food and not enough food is very slim. 1. They ran out of the lobster and shrimp burger. The time was 4pm in the afternoon on a Friday. 2. We waited nearly an hour to get our meal. (A burger and a veggie burger) Mind you something I only settled for due to the face that my first choice was sold out.

The burgers were soooo good omfg. We both got medium rare and it was nice and juicy. We also got the truffle Parmesan fries which comes with garlic aioli and something else. The garlic aioli gmfu in a good way though. Legit I would eat that garlic aioli with everything haha. The other sauce was just too sweet so we didn't like it very much. The servers are friendly, but we waited 30+ minutes for our food. People that came way after us got their food before us or at the same time so that's why I knocked off a star. Would def come back if I'm ever in town again.",

    "text": "Unfortunately our experience was not a good one. We asked when we first were seated how long we should expect to be waiting for our food, because we are on a time crunch. The waitress said it takes about 25 minutes to have our burgers come out. We ordered, got our drinks and even got a refill on our drinks. Then almost 40 minutes later we are told by our waitress that our food will be right out. Guess what? Our food never showed up. The manager on duty, Zach, came over and was apologetic and helpful. He found out that our ticket wasn't ever put in. That is a damn shame. Zach then took our order and told us it would be out in a few minutes and on the house. He kept to his word, and our food came out within 5-7 minutes. The waitress came up to us and apologized and stated it was her fault and not the kitchen's. I appreciate her being forthcoming and all, but that didn't help that we were now running late because of this mess and still had not eaten lunch! I thought things were looking up, but then when our food came out my burger was f*cking well done!! I asked for medium. -- So to start out our waitress forgot to put our order in, then the kitchen messes up my order, and we are waiting over an hour. I didn't even finish the whole burger. The fries were over done;almost as if they had been sitting under a warmer for a period of time. So incredibly unimpressed.",

The poutine was very good, i would highly recommend. But the onion ringer were terrible and very oily. All the burgers were very good, but the waiter did mess up my order and brought a different burger. After notifying them of the mistake they brought my burger about 10 minutes later and they took it off the bill. All together a good experience.",

I came back here early june to find out they took it off their menu which was a bummer to hear but Instead I tried one of his other options I got the tandoori chicken burger I believe. It was VERY moist and had amazing flavor to it ! I highly recommend it, My husband got the hells kitchen burger and he was it was pretty damn good. and My in-laws also got great burgers but unfortunately I cannot remember them at the moment. I suggested we get the onion rings because the batter (from what I last remembered) was out of this world! His recipes are to die for and his kitchen runs so smoothly.

    "text": "I'm not sure why we go to celebrity chef restaurants like sheep to have our wallets sheared.  It's not like they are in the kitchen ensuring the food that is turned out is up to their standards.  The host of Kitchen Nightmares needs to hurry back to Planet Hollywood Las Vegas and get all Hell's Kitchen on whomever he left in charge.  Arriving after a long trip to Las Vegas, we didn't feel like getting dressed up and going out so we decided on Gordon Ramsay Burger for dinner.  We arrived just in time to get seated right away.  A long line formed soon after and I started to feel sorry for these people because they had no idea what mediocrity awaited them.  Before I go further, our waitress Ashley was fantastic!  We started with Burnt Ends Poutine.  If you don't know what that is, consult your cardiologist before trying it.  It is delicious; just not this one.  We found GR's to be slimy.  They used the really big steak fries which tend to be too soft.  IMO, if they would've used a smaller cut fry that crisped more, then the gravy wouldn't have made them so slimy.  The burnt ends were good.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  It was good, the jalapeno gave it some great heat without being overbearing.  My only complaint is that the cheese and oil from the roasted jalapeno and roasted tomatoes made the condiments slippery and the burger messy to eat.  But, maybe that's just an eating disorder of mine.  My fiancee ordered the Ale Dawg.  It is a bacon wrapped Sabrett hot dog.  She took a couple bites and couldn't go on.  Of course, bacon is high in sodium but she said the hot dog on it's own was so high in sodium it was inedible.  Ashley replaced it with the Wheatberry-Quinoa Salad.  It was lathered in oil like it was going to lay out by the pool.  My fiancee just bit her tongue and ate around the oily greens.  When the bill came, I noticed that Ashley had removed the poutine and hotdog from the bill without being asked so I gave her a very big tip.  Another positive is that they have Unibroue's La Fin du Monde on tap.  It's one of my favorite beers so cheers, GR!  It cracks me up how there are so many chef competition shows on TV where you hear the judges critique each other over a single scale left on a salmon prepped and cooked in 5 minutes or a couple extra grains of salt, etc.  Meanwhile, us regular folk are served this crap for an arm and a leg.  Do yourself a favor and don't go unless you want to have a beer.",

When you check in you give them your phone number and they text you when your table is ready. Which is a really nice feature because you can walk around the casino or even go back up to your room if you are staying there.  The food was delicious! I had the ultimate cheeseburger since I am a big fan of cheese, it did not disappoint really juicy and the cheese is fantastic.  We shared the truffle fries and onion rings. Personally, I liked the onion rings better, they were light and not oily. The sauces they give you are also very good. Both of my sisters really enjoyed their burgers, one is vegetarian and got the portobello mushroom burger she loved it and it did look very tasty, the other one got the blue cheeseburger she was very satisfied with the burger. All in all we all really enjoyed our food and would definalty come back next time we are in Vegas.",

They took about 45 minutes that day when promised around 30 minutes for a to go order (anxiety)! Regardless they were nice and didn't seem bothered when we kept checking in on them.   The burgers were about $15 a pop, which isn't too bad, I've seen worse! I got the hell's burger. Medium well, my friend got it well done and it was very dry! It was tasty! Had all the right things inside for my liking!   The truffle fries and sauce they used on them were amazing, get those with extra sauce!   This place was good, I would definitely go back and try out some other things the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Wait took forever, they sat us next to the fire wall but we were way too hot and the staff reaccomdated our seating which made them get 5 stars in my book. Our waiter was helpful and really knew the menu. Reason for the lower ranking is that I had really high hopes for this place. Now I ate the entire burger because I was so hungry. The ketchup is home made and I was not a fan, it was spicy almost like a cocktail sauce, but just not good with their fries. Fries were overly seasoned. I preferred the regular ones over the truffle. The onion rings were bomb. The burger I had was good, but dry and I did not like the cheese on there, very stinky like goat. I prefer red robin over this place.",

    "text": "The sweet potato fries are amazing! Served with a jalapeno honey sauce that's rad. The ketchup is also fresh and delicious. However the trying to be trendy metal cone in which they are served causes most of the fries to become soggy before you get a chance to eat them.  The burgers are pretty lovely. Have had The pilgrim every time. Heard great things from my Indian lover about the indian themed burger.  A creme brulee milkshake shouldn't be served with whipped cream, covering the brulee top. Be sure to order without whipped cream! The milkshakes are too sweet, the creme brulee pudding is good but sweeter than a creme brulee- more like American vanilla pudding.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the chips n gravy.  I actually like getting the shake and fries take out because I can take them home and pop the fries in the oven and shake in the freezer, so the shake is thicker and the fries are crispier. It would be grand if they were thicker and crispier, respectively, in house. Fries gotta be crispy!   I also wish this location offered alcoholic milkshakes, I love a chocolate milkshake with Guiness or malt liquor.",

For as much as he talks about seasoning, there certainly wasn't any on my burgers or fries except for cumin in the ketchup which was less than appealing. I just went with the plain Backyard burger hoping for good flavor but apparently you need to slather it with 3 different cheese and sauces and bacon to make it taste good.  I would skip this place and go straight to Shake Shack.",

Our burgers, and a order of fries that we split came out quickly.  Burger was done perfect. It was honestly 1 of the best burgers I have ever ate. Rick did a awesome job taking care of us both. Did a great job with his pairings. If you head there for lunch, or dinner...Rick is your guy",

The first round of sauces provided had very little flavor and weren't enough for the amount of fries in the cup. The second round of sauces, while supposedly being the same thing, tasted completely different. They were so different I thought they had given me something else... And now for the burger... Let's start with the good: The burger was cooked perfectly; it was juicy, had great grill marks, and a bit of char flavor. The egg was also cooked perfectly; no extra juices and the yolk was completely runny... Now for the bad: Aside from the slight char flavor of the meat, there was almost no flavor to the burger. It's like they are scared of seasonings. Also, the burger sat too long after being plated because the bottom bun was soaked completely making it extremely soggy and difficult to handle... Again, not saying it was bad, but I would rather have gone somewhere like Five Guys and spent 1/3 of the money.",

I could just hear Gordon in my head screaming at the staff had he been there.  We were borderline walking out when it finally arrived.  The food was pretty amazing I will admit.

We both are huge chef Gordon Ramsey fans, we wanted to see if his meals were as good as they looked on TV! We showed up at about 3pm on Friday. It was a 30 minute wait in line just to see the hostess! Bring comfy shoes because there is nowhere to sit down unless you want to lose your place. I did see a couple come up in front of the line and retrieve a reservation they had made, so if that is a thing they allow I highly recommend doing it. There is a large fireplace with custom ironwork. It can be very warm standing in line so make sure you have layers that you can shed. But it was worth the wait. After getting through the line, we were seated immediately. I ordered a Backyard Burger with bacon and Dubliner cheese, I'm sure it tastes authentic with American Cheese but I wanted something a little more adventurous. I ordered an IPA cause you can't have a burger without a good beer. Their beer selection had a decent variety but not overwhelming. The food came fast but not rushed, I'm sure they take their time preparing. Burger was as good as I hoped it would be. I was surprised how high the burger was stacked, I generally like burgers I can fit in my mouth and not have to cut with a fork. And the spicy ketchup that came with the fries was interesting and good! Overall great experience. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Food was top notch.",

I have never used this term on a burger before, and didn't think it was possible, but the meat seemed to melt in my mouth!  Everything on the burger worked well together, the seasoning on the bun ('everything' seasoning maybe?) had a little saltiness and a bit of crunch to the soft bread, the herb aioli was delicious, the arugula was a perfect leafy green to the burg, the ONLY thing I might have changed is to have a slightly heartier slice of the mimolette cheese on the meat.  Also had the truffle fries which were amazing good -- they came out nice and hot and the truffle was not overpowering.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it...",

Last night we ordered the Backyard Burger with no cheese; they put cheese on it. It took 40 minutes to get 2 burgers. The bartender (served at the bar) didn't put in the order for sweet potato fries. We just let it go because it wasn't worth the wait or fight. We opted to eat at the bar because there was virtually no wait, and now I know why. Be prepared for fast drinks, but noisy and inconsiderate wait staff collecting their tips from the bartender's POS. They bumped into us jockeying for position to get their cash, threw trash over the counter, and left a mess next to us. They did this with no qualms, which tells me this is regular behavior at a top chef's establishment. People will eat here regardless because it's Ramsay's place, but perhaps Ramsay may want to pay more attention to the staff that represents his name. As for the food, it is good, but worth a 40 minute wait? Not so much.",

Luckily we were really hungry that we can finish all.  Chicken wings was what I was craving for. Im not a big fan of blue cheese but it was a good combination with the wings.  I would say the lobster burger was slightly better. The beef burger was well cook to what I ordered(medium well)  Truffle fries were a bit too hard (i think they were coated with corn starch). Service was Ok as it was not too busy.",

My first reaction when I saw the menue was that it was actually reasonably priced and there was a lot of original burgers with high end ingredients!  I decided to go for the forest burger as I like my classic bacon cheeseburger but this one had tremor cheese, forest mushrooms and duck bacon !  When it came out the burger looked gorgeous and the onion rings were huuuuge haven't ever seen them that size and thankfully we were sharing them!  So the burger itself did feel like it was mass produced but one of the best tasting one I have ever eaten and as for the onion rings very crispy but more then 3 would probably blow up my stomach so definitely a good dish to share. I really have to say that for lunch it's the perfect experience in Vegas! Casual, good value and fun !",

I do have to admit, I did have high expectations of a \"Gordon Ramsey\" restaurant.  Everything from service to quality was absolutely unenjoyable.   Small patties are hidden under an oversized bun. I expected a nice handmade patty, plump, and juicy, but the patties were undersized and all perfectly shaped and well-pressed under the flame. I ventured to order a \"special\" burger: lobster and shrimp... boy-o-boy was that a bad idea. The patty tasted like a rubber tire! I took a couple of bites just to make sure it wasn't me and tossed in the napkin. It ruined my appetite.  Quite some time after I'd tossed in the napkin, a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. I commented on the poor quality and preparation of the lobster and shrimp burger. He did apologize and asked why I didn't let them know, as they could have made me another, but when I said I wouldn't want to try it again he said he'd let the kitchen know and simply moved on.   The sides were just as disappointing. The sweet potato fries were soggy, barely warm and covered in powdered sugar. They were served with a sweet opaque sauce they called a spicy aioli, but there was absolutely nothing spicy about it... it tasted like desert.   I'd put burgers, sandwiches and fries at this establishment in the same class as Red Robin, Johnny Rockets, Applebee's, etc.   If you want a good meal, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Upon our arrival we glanced inside and noted many available tables. There was a long line outside but thought they simply needed to get people seated so we jumped in line.  The reality was that they were saving the tables for groups of four and would not seat a party of two. Everyone in the line was in groups of two. I understand they are there to make money. And filling each chair means money. We decided to wait it out and while waiting reviewed the menu online. 35 minutes later we were seated. 12 minutes after being seated, our waiter stopped by to introduce himself. He wanted to excuse himself to go get our water but we asked if he could take our order now. He seemed bothered but obliged us and took our order for a burger and fries (x2). I set my timer again. While waiting, the couple next to us received their order. I commented \"I hope it is worth the wait\". They replied that they had waited over an hour for their food to arrive. They finished eating while we waited. I asked \"so was it worth the wait\"? They replied F. NO! It was just an expensive burger and fries! From the time we placed our order until the burger and fries were on our table we waited 72 minutes. Yes, an hour and 12 minutes.  No burger and fries is worth waiting a total of two hours for. To summarize the food I would have to say it is way over hyped and fails to deliver anything more than a burger and fries. And the service was off the low end of the charts.  As we walked out there was still a long line of groups of two and the same tables for groups of four were still unoccupied. What a poorly managed business.  Not only will I never go back to a Gordon Ramsay's burger restaurant. But I will never support anything with his name on it. Further, I will make sure anyone I care about knows of my experience and is forewarned.",

Service was terrible, the waiters never asked us how our food was or even refilled our drinks. The 17.00 burger was good but the bun was very greasy. At the end of our meal, we waited and waited for our waiter to bring our check.  Then we had to walk up to the register to pay because the guy never came back to pick up our check and payment. You'd think for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant at their high prices would have extraordinary service. But unfortunately Denny's would have been a better experience! Very disappointed!!",

    "text": "OH boy can you say that this place is the BOMB! Since I have been to Gordon's Steak House I vowed on my next visit to Vegas that I would come to this place. First and foremost I want to thank the new GM Laurence from Gordon't Steak House for arranging a table for my family and I will forever be grateful for it was perfect.  Gordon Ramsay Burger is located in Planet Hollywood which is right next to Paris. This location is on a first come first serve bases. When we went to the counter to announce our arrival we were greeted with a very welcoming smile and they informed us that they were expecting us and they were preparing our table. As  we awaited the few minutes for them to finish preparing our table we had a chance to review the menu which was in Gordon's style; simple and elegant.   In the front of the restaurant there was a bar with several TV's for watching current sporting events for those who wanted to enjoy some appetizers with their drinks. As we were brought to our table we were seated in a lovely blue colored booth with the traditional Ramsay white table setting. My brother was amazed by the weight of the cutlery, which I love a nice balanced fork and knife. Our waiter Jared was just amazing, he answered some of questions about the various types of hamburger's that were offered on the menu. Jared also informed us that they had a special F Word burger that was not on the menu and of course you knew I was going to have exactly that. I also informed Jared of my allergies to shellfish and nuts, which he had made a special note so that the staff would be informed to use equipment that were not used with any products that could cause an allergic reaction.   Some the of things we ordered along with our main dishes was a delicious Cesar salad with green apple slices minus the kale, I am not a kale fan. We also ordered regular fries and the truffle fries with parmesan cheese. The funny thing is that the pictures makes these fries look small but they are actually fairly big and even with 3 of us we could not finish all the fries. The nice served with different sauces too and came out hot and crispy golden.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxing and it has this wonderful wavy fire wall display. The temperature in the restaurant was perfect, yes I am one of those people that get cold easy lol so things like this are very important to me. Jared was very attentive and informed us that our special burgers will take about 20 minutes and I do appreciate that he served all our burgers along with the fries at the same time and they were all nice and hot. We were able to enjoy our dinner and Jared was very attentive by removing dishes that were not needed anymore and keeping our drinks constantly filled. If we were not so stuffed we would have ordered one of their delicious desserts but again the 3 of us shared a salad and fries and we all had our own individual burgers and we were stuffed.   I wish I could describe how delicious this burger was but I have to let the picture speak for itself.  I know that there is no doubt that I will come back here again and I would hope they still offered the F Word burger. If you have a list of things to do in Vegas then put this on your list for you will not be disappointed. Everything is well thought out and you may think 23.00 for a burger? Well it is one of the best damm hamburgers you will ever have I can promise you that.",

If you're a Vegas tourist, expect a lot of walking just to find this place - deep inside the Planet Hollywood (PH) casino. I'm not a fan of PH at all. I think it's a dump - one of the dirtiest places on the Vegas strip. (No wonder it's the center for drug dealers and strip scammers.) That's the biggest disadvantage I think this wonderful burger restaurant has.   Otherwise, just make sure you arrive before 4p.m. on weekends to avoid long lines. In spite of its location, it's worth trying out at least once!",

Huge poster of Gordon Ramsay hanging on the wall yet he's rarely at Vegas. They also sell Gordon Ramsay gifts such as trophy, shirt, apron, etc for fans. Our waiter was very quick and nice. For first timer we went with Hell Kitchen Burger and Hog Burger which is their specialty. Both tasted very delicious, meat was cooked perfectly, my Hell Kitchen burger was more on the spicy side due to the added jalapenos. My husband's Hog Burger tasted even better, meat was exactly medium rare as he ordered and yet the flavor was there, seasoned really well, don't know why some reviews here said it's bland, the patty for Hog Burger was wrapped in bacon so it was super juicy and has lots of flavors. My patty for Hell Kitchen Burger was cooked medium well per my request and got the char flavor to it yet still juicy at the same time. Their buns was grilled nicely, has a very shiny color and taste so really good and slightly crispy. Overall, the burgers totally worth the money, visually and taste-wise.",

The hops were nothing out of the ordinary for IPAs   Had the farmers burger and hells kitchen burger both were really good. The hells kitchen burger has jalapeno aioli and roasted jalapeno, fresh avocado which complimented the burger alot, and some good cheese. That burger was a killer. The farmers burger was good too, with an over easy egg and duck bacon, which tasted like regular bacon to me.  Service was weak, since i guess its closing time.",

    "text": "The burgers themselves were good. We had the farmhouse burger, forest burger (mushrooms), and hell's kitchen burger. Personally, I thought the Hell's Kitchen was the best because the jalapenos gave a nice subtle kick to the overall sort of oily and overbearing burger. It also wasn't really spicy which is good because I can't do spicy. They were gourmet style with steak patties, so they asked us how we wanted them, but I would say they burgers didn't come out exactly the way we ordered them (though that wasn't too big of a deal). Biggest problem was the wait. It actually didn't take too long to get into the restaurant (we had a party of five and so we skipped the line and was in the queue) ~20 min, but when they called us up, we had to wait another 15-20 minutes in front of the restaurant for the table to \"be cleaned\". I don't know why they would call us up telling us our table was ready when it wasn't. Also, once seated and after we ordered, it took forever for the burgers to come out. We ordered onion rings (good, not spectacular) which came with two sauces (one white and one red, something like tartar and bbq) which came out relatively quickly, but the burgers took another good 40 minutes.  Overall, I don't think it's worth the wait. The burgers or onion rings weren't spectacular in taste. They were good, and I'm glad to try them once, but I don't think I would make the effort to go back again.",

I don't eat onions.  I requested the onions be removed and the waitress stated \"since they have made changes to the menu, the \"chef\" will not make any changes (including removing ONE ingredient).

The roasted jalapeno made me want to return home to Texas and add these to everything: wheat roast sandwiches, cream of mushroom soup, vinaigrette.  My biggest fear is being hungry because when that happens, I either turn into a beast, feel faint, or both. While the burger didn't look too substantial, it ended up being the perfect amount - paired with the plain fries - to feel satisfied, but not overstuffed.   As others have mentioned, the fries were terrible: lukewarm, dry, dense, grainy. Oh well, it's not called Gordon Ramsey Fries.I still ate them, because: fries. Next time, I'll try the onion rings.   The burger was such a delicious experience and the service was exceptionally timed and friendly. I can't wait to return.",

The server came out to introduce himself and took our beverages and order. It was my friends and I first time eating here so the waiter was extremely helpful on pointing out which one to try. He suggested the Hell's kitchen Burger for me so I took his suggestion.  The restaurant was semi busy during the lunch rush so the food came out in a fairly decent time. Our server was amazing. He catered to our every needs so the customer service here is superb.  As I bit into the burger, I could immediately taste the seasoned, savory, juicy burger going down my esophagus. I felt the heat from the grilled jalapenos and jalapenos aioli spread swirling on my tongue. The egg yolk was gushing down the burger which gave it a nice syrupy coating to the sandwich. The cheese also gave it that sharp taste and creamy texture. There was so many flavors and texture happening all at once. The sesame buns was a great choice of bread. A solid burger if you were to ask me! Sweet potato fries were good as well but I could care less about it.   The ice cream smoothie dessert was great itself.  Nothing special but a delicious treat to eat none the less. Overall, it was an great dining experience for a first timer. And yes I would recommend it to a friend!",

So we decided to try something new and it was good the only down fall is that where they sat us was close to the slot machines so all I smelled was cigarette smoke and so I thought they should put up higher glass. But the waiter he was good and the food was very good.  Would we eat here again yes may even try the  locations he has.   My kids who are picky even found food to eat.",

    "text": "Unfortunately... we were excited to eat here. Big fans of Mr Ramsay. Waited in line, but we figured the finish line would be worth it.. Pleasant staff! Ambience typical of an upscale burger place. The waitress had told us that Gordon Ramsay was supposed to be coming  to visit the next day - pretty cool! We both ordered the specialty Fish and Chips Burger and regular fries to share. They came fairly quickly and looked amazing... However- my sandwich had a very distinct odor and taste of AMMONIA?! I struggled through the first half and kept wondering if I was confusing the sauce, something else.. knowing that vinegar has an acidic taste ( I love malt vinegar on my fish and chips!) and this smelled and tasted like... ugh -  like Mr Clean! I normally don't make a fuss about food, but quietly queried my husband to see if he was picking up on the same flavor profile...? And yes- he did too- so we both were left with half eaten sandwiches. To boot- the fries were only barely warm as well. The waitress came by at that moment and the look on our faces prompted her to ask if everything was ok... we normally don't make a fuss and implored the waitress to not do anything, comp, etc... but to just inform the manager that something was wrong? I invited her to even smell my sandwich and she declined. We laughed and said that we were pretty sure that GR wouldn't want his fish sandwiches smelling/tasting like ammonia? She came back with the check and told us that the manager had never heard that comment or complaint before.... uh- end of story. So, we paid and left. Likely never to return. When we got back to our hotel we started googling fish and ammonia smell... and apparently it is a smell associated with old/decomposing fish!!?? Ugh- I'm writing this and hoping we won't get sick tonight. Best of luck to others... and I hope Mr. Ramsay takes this seriously. We are pretty bummed at the experience. Am a bit leary now of eating at his more upscale restaurants?",

Full of flavor, perfect blend of cheese and very juicy!  And to top it all off!!!  We saw Gordon Ramsay!!!  It certainly made my day!",

Our bartenders name  who's name i forgot was awesome, and polite. We sat at the bar.   We ordered the bleu cheese wings and they were amazing! The sauce and cheese was the perfect combo. I did order ranch and it was super thick and didn't taste good at all   When we ordered our burgers we were informed that it would take about 30 minutes, I think they actually got to us faster.   The taste was okay, and mediocre. The meat had no flavor at all, honestly I think Burger King has a better flavor. The presentation was okay, but over REALLY REALLY underwhelmed with the burger itself. The fries were okay too, but just okay.   Not a place that I'd go back to that's for sure. The bill was over $80 for one drink 2 burgers with 1 order of fries and an appetizer",

The hostesses Jasmine and Jessica were so friendly and accommodating even though the line was rather long, it moved quickly and since we were only 2 it wasn't that long before we were seated. I had read on a previous Yelp Review mostly bad things about the restaurant, the waiters, and the hostesses and I can tell you totally wrong.   We were seated and our waiter ADAM who was terrific, explained a few of the burgers to us since this was our first time there. We ordered \"The Backyard\" and the \"Stout Burger\" and both were absolutely delicious!.    We waited a little while, not too long considering the restaurant was completely filled.  The Burgers were delicious!   Also being it was my son's birthday our waiter took it upon himself to bring a little dessert with a candle in it.  I thought that was really special.   So all I can say is the hostesses Jasmine and Jessica are wonderful, and ADAM our waiter was the BEST!... There is nothing negative to write.  This is a great eating establishment with good food, a great staff  and wonderful service.  Will return...........",

BURGERS,  I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger, that had avocado and poblano peppers. I love spicy food and let me tell you the pepper in this was just that!  I was actually surprised how spicy it was but it hit the spot for me. Very juicy and good balance of bun, meat and accompaniments. My hubby got the Lobster and shrimp burger  this was probably my favorite of the two!!! It was lightly panko breaded with chunky chops of lobster and shrimp patty. There was definitely more meat than bread.  It was sooo juicy and topped with pickled vegetables and aioli that really have the whole burger that flavor pop in your mouth!! Thinking about makes my mouth water.   FRIES,  we had parmesan fries and onion rings that they serve with cheesy ranch dip and chipotle ketchup. These were both very good,  maybe a little parmesan overload, but if you like that,  then definitely get them both. They were a bit too heavy and rich for me so we couldn't finish either.  Next time I will get 1 order to share. But all in all they were great!  DRINKS,  I had sangria which definitely did the job!   Good serving size and right amount of strength,  not watered down like most places.   Great place to go for date night, with  friends or just by yourself at the bar! Service was quick and friendly,  we had Andre who sad very knowledgeable of the menu and made some great suggestions!",

Oh and don't forget the star power name attached to the place. But once you get inside, it kinda feels like an upscale diner.   It has a mix of counter, low and high table seating which seems plenty but the place has built quite the reputation and can certainly draw a crowd. If you don't mind the wait the food is pretty good. They take your favorite burgers and fries and kick it up a notch. I had the anniversary burger and truffle fries. The burger is made in limited amounts so ask ahead to see if they have any. The gourmet beef patties are cooked over an open flame using prime cuts of meat. And of course the fries are generously coated with a taste of rich truffles.  If the line is short I'll probably pop in again.",

My wife and I love his shows and thought we would love to try his burger. We traveled with our family and we were a party of 6. We arrived around 12:30 for lunch and we were told it would be an hour. We asked if it was possible to have 3 tables of 2 near each other so that we wouldn't have to wait as long since we saw plenty of empty tables available specially directly behind the hostess's desk. The answer we were given was no that would not be possible. After talking a while longer they agreed to sit us in 3 separate tables. They proceed to sit us in separate sections of the restaurant. I really didn't understand why it was so difficult to just listen to the customers request instead of upsetting them for no apparent reason. My wife asked for the manager Joe. Which after listening to our request stated that unfortunately that was the policy of the restaurant and did nothing to accommodate us. Sad when \"policies\" supersede customer requests. Ultimately the waitresses were the only ones that had any customer skills and assisted us . The food came out and it was delicious although my family did not agree with me I believe it was more due to being upset with the service we had initially received.  Service is key to any business and if Ramsay's name is on it the expectation was so much more than we received. I hope this is not the norm and they figure out that the customers needs and wants come before any known policy which ultimately doesn't make sense.  All that said best wishes to Gordon Ramsay his success is due to his achievements in the kitchen which is well earned.",

    "text": "For late-night dinner I tried the beer-battered onion rings ($9), burnt ends poutine ($14), truffle parmesan fries ($12), and the pork chop and applesauce burger ($16).  The onion rings seemed well-battered. The batter did not overwhelm with oil and possessed a fluffy texture.  The burnt ends poutine seemed at times over- and under-garnished. The burnt ends, in their limited quantity and size, made no apparent change in flavor profile. The shredded carrots' hard texture did not juxtapose well with the rest of the dish; future iterations should omit the carrots. The cheddar cheese curds also arrived in such limited quantities that they made no significant effect. The only redeemable element of the poutine, the black pepper gravy, had a lot of black pepper but needed a thicker consistency.  The truffle parmesan fries seemed satisfactory.  The pork chop applesauce burger contained a pork patty, dubliner cheese, branston pickles, apple braised pork shank, and cabbage-apple slaw. While these items individually sound delicious, their combination seemed underwhelming. The base pork patty seemed subdued in flavor, and the apple braising dominated the palate, relegating the other flavors to afterthoughts.  With the majority of my meal (burger + 1 appetizer) resulting in mediocrity, I will pass on future opportunities at this establishment.",

Even with that, our wait time was 28 minutes which it's not too bad considering the popularity of the restaurant.  The three hostesses were very overwhelmed and not friendly at all. Once seated it took 15 minutes to take our order and 40 minutes to be served burgers, fries and beer.  The restaurant is too small for the high demand. That was the downside.  The upside is that the food was incredibly delicious. It was one of the best burger I've ever had. We got all three types of fries that they offered and onion rings which by the way, were amazing.  The servers were friendly and helpful. It is definitely something to experience when visiting Las Vegas (Planet Hollywood)",

    "text": "A delicious burger for everyone! Let me start by saying that I love anything Ramsay (TV shows, Restaurants, etc...). Upon arriving at this restaurant the look of the restaurant is very Casual chic. I love the wall of fire on the outside of this restaurant. The hostess greeted me warmly and since I was alone she asked if I wanted a table or sit at the counter facing the kitchen. I love being at the counter because you get to watch the action of the Kitchen and you have the captive audience of the staff that are back there.  They have a selection of approx. 25 beers so they offer these shooter glasses of beer to taste a couple before choosing. Love it! I tried a IPA and a citrus beer to compare. I chose the Citrus Missy and it was amazing. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger (from a very good selection of different burgers) medium-rare with fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the avocado added a nice texture to it. The fries however were a little stale (slightly warm but just tasted stale.). The service throughout was friendly and engaging. The Wait-staff seem like they really like their job. I asked about Gordon, if he ever came to the restaurant and the said he comes sometimes and is very nice and takes pics with the staff. Glad to hear he has a softer side. I would definitely return to try out other burgers.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.ca%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d3729453-r538150593-Gordon_Ramsay_Burger-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=df6f4528aa2733654089c2694afecf004d858d8acc80ec83ccad460cd3578e18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR...</a>",

    "text": "It bums me out having to write this review because my expectations of this place were super high.   It was 10 min from the time that we got sat before our server came to introduce herself to us. She came over and asked if we were ready to order, my husband needed some more time, so she said she would come back. She could've easily taken our drink order but she never asked. When she came back, took our order, then at that time she asked us what we wanted to drink. It seemed odd due to the fact that everywhere we go, we get asked what we want to drink before anything else. Anywho, we never saw that server again, a younger gentleman came out with our appetizers and sat them down, it wasn't until shortly after that our drinks came out...   The food was okay. We ordered the Kettle Chip Nachos, it was a little disappointing with the small about of shredded short rib it had! I'm pretty sure I would've been able to count the shreds of beef on these chips. We ordered some fries for our 2 year old to eat and they were so hard and tasteless, she gave up after 2 bites and would shake her head no when we offered her some more. This little girl eats crayons and she refused to eat these fries.    Next up was our burgers. I ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger, it come with different kinds of cheese and just the meat. My son ordered the Backyard burger, just a basic burger and my husband ordered the Hog Burger. These were actually pretty good. They aren't served with any sides so we ended up ordering some beer battered onion rings, but just like the drinks... these didn't come out until later, way later.   Basically, service needs to improve. All food should come out at once except for the appetizer, don't bring out the side to my burger when I'm half way thru with it, at that point don't being me anything at all. We found out that the server never came back to our table because she got sent home, there was no introduction to the person that was going to be taking over her section. Really? And on top of this bad service, I'll still expected to tip 18 %  I don't think we'd come back, we have reservations for Hell's Kitchen in a couple of weeks, hoping that it will be a much better experience.",

The sweet potato fries with powdered sugar and sweet dipping sauce was flavorfully brilliant.  We also ordered the cookies and cream milk shake. Sooo good. $10 milk shake better be good lol. The waitress suggested we wait till we go to Hell's Kitchen to try the sticky toffee pudding. Overall a great experience but server should suggest desserts not suggest to try t elsewhere. Thank god we had reservation for Hell's Kitchen. And it was so good.",

    "text": "BurGR was always a staple for us during all of our Vegas trips. When we passed by on our most recent visit and saw that it got rebranded to Gordon Ramsay Burger, we were a little surprised, but it makes total sense seeing as how GR seems to be taking over the strip with new places.  The menu has been revamped. There are definitely new items, and there aren't Total Rewards discounts anymore. The shakes have also been redone so that they aren't just named by numbers anymore. All that being said, the quality of the food is just as good as it was. Juicy, medium rare burgers with heapings of mouthwatering toppings that will just barely fit into your mouth.  Farmhouse Burger. Still our classic go-to. A juicy burger topped with bacon and a fried egg. You know, just in case the burger itself wasn't enough protein for you. The bacon has been upgraded from duck bacon to mangalitsa bacon, which we're told is like the kobe beef of pork. What's mangalitsa, you ask? Google it. You won't be sorry.  Forest Burger. This one offers up more greens in the form of arugula and 'shrooms. Duck bacon still comes into play here though, so don't let the name fool you into thinking this is just made of rabbit food.  Just Fries. Because sometimes, you just want to be fries. Thick cut fries served with two sauces. One reminded me of a curry-like sauce and the other was more a traditional ketchup with a kick.  Didn't have room for dessert this time, but we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Like many another's that have visited vegas, I came here because of name, Gordon Ramsay. I wanted to experience what it was truly like be in one of his restaurants after so many years seeing him on tv. It also helped that the restaurant was just across the street from our hotel. Located in the planet Hollywood hotel, sits Gordon Ramsey fame burger restaurant. When we arrived around 4pm there was no wait but the restaurant was filled with customers. Shortly after we were seated a line started to build for the dinner crowd so luckily we arrived in time. The menu is made of paper and you get to keep it as a souvenir if you wish. As you would expect, a wide selection of burgers, from the classic with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and American cheese to   After waiting 30 minutes our burgers and fries finally arrived. I had the thick steak fries, while my girlfriend had the sweet potatoes fries sprinkled with powder sugar. They are very liberal with their fries portion, so one order is more than enough for two people. The fries were stale as they keep them sitting under heat lamps. I don't understand that if they are going to keep hungry people waiting 30 minutes for their order, why don't they just bring out the fries ahead of time so that people are occupied with food and the fries see fresher.   When we asked the server why such a long wait, he replied it normally takes 30 minutes at minimum for the food to be prepared. It didn't help that we were starving since all my girlfriend and I had were granola bars and snack chips, but having to wait 30 minutes for any meal is just not acceptable.     I had the forest because mushrooms go so well with burgers but the seasonal mushrooms just didn't do it for me. They were sparse and didn't add much flavor. The burger meat was okay. I'll be honest, Denys burgers are much better. If you haven't tried Denys new burgers they are actually pretty good, I highly recommend.  I was definitely expecting a lot more from someone who is such a critic of others. Perhaps Gordon Ramsey should film his own restaurant in an episode of Kitchen Nightmare.",

The burgers were great and will be returning to try more of them. Also the truffle fries were outstanding, even down to the dipping sauces that came with them. Lastly, the sticky toffee ice cream sandwich was more then I expected. Overall, the portions are all very good. My partner and I split an order of fries and that was more than enough for both of us.

We both tried something different this time is set up a hamburger we tried a chicken burger and a lobster and shrimp burger. Both of them were very pleasing and tasty. Wasn't just a chicken patty it was actually chicken that had been formed into a chicken patty and then cooked properly to make it better than just your usual fried chicken thrown on a bun. We have asked for our onion rings to be delivered before the meal they did not get there until the meal. There were numerous orders of onion rings sitting under the lamp that we could see from our table. When the server brought our food we address this and her response was if you don't want them I'll eat them. With the Empire of restaurants Mr. Ramsey has,we have noticed that there are the same issues you would find in other restaurants. Some servers do not understand it took a lot of work to build a brand and they are tarnishing it with their attitudes and lack of attention. The food does keep us coming back in most cases.",

It did take a while for food to arrived because the kitchen was busy and backed up. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger to share with my sister. Also go the Oreo creme brulee shake, onion rings, Parmesan fries, and sweet potato fries. The Hell's Kitchen burger was ok, wish it was spicier. Filling enough for me and my sister. The fries were pretty good but after a while it will get soft. The onion rings were really good and came with cheese ranch. The milkshake though was the best. It will be my sole reason for every coming to this overhyped and overpriced",

I ordered my burger well done and it has soooo much pink that they had to take it back to recook (3 other people at my table had the same issue) 2. The service was mediocre and the waitress didn't come buy enough to check on us 3. The burgers took 45 once the order was placed 4) For the price of the burgers and fries it wasn't worth it.  I got the Parmesan truffle fries and I did not like them at all. There was way too much Parmesan cheese on it  The manager was very apologetic about the burgers not being cooked how we ordered them so she gave us 10% off and everyone got a free dessert! Now the dessert is amazing!!! I tried to Oreo and chocolate shake and YUM!! The Oreo shake tastes better to me as the chocolate shake was very rich.  I won't be returning.",

Onion rings are delicious and fries are good not over the top. Ketchup = what is this imposter red sauce they serve with the fries and rings???  I get the I am Gordon Ramsey and a great chef but let's leave it at that and serve the best ketchup ever Heinz!    All the Burgers we ordered are very good! Cooked perfectly and meat has great flavor. Light handed on the sauces which is perfect for me I don't want the meat masked.   Prices are excellent!",

We even waited the 40 minutes around 8 pm on the 28th of January, 2019 although we were starving of hunger! We then sit down and a very polite waitress took our order and came out with the appetizer fairly quickly. After my first bite of the Kettle Nachos my stomach started to feel nauseous. I continued eating them because I was so hungry and thought my nausea would go away as I continue to eat, especially at what most people would consider a high end restaurant. Finishing the Nachos I then take a bite out of my Farmhouse burger and run straight to the bathroom. On my first trip to the restroom I had serious diarrhea symptoms hoping my stomach would feel better so I can finish the atleast 20$ burger I am paying for. I go back to the table, try for another bite, and I immediately ran back to the restroom again to vomit everything I ate out! I couldn't even finish my meal & went to sleep/woke up feeling very sick. My stomach feels like it's battling a bacteria. Me and my family would watch Ramsay all the time on TV and honestly it's ironic how I never got sick before eating at a restaurant until I ate here! I feel mislead and definitely think I deserve a  compensation for the meal I didn't even finish. Also I wasn't the only one sick at the table just saying!",

We got some tequila shots while we waited. $11 a shot, but they were a good pour and the bar tender put some salt in the shot itself so it was super smooth. We also ordered a mixed drink of Jameson and champagne, and the bar tender was happy to make it for us. Food took a while to come out, but once it did OH MY GOD! My fiance and I shared the just fries and they were cooked perfectly with great dippings. My fiance got the farm house burger medium rare and loved it, but let me tell you the foie burger that I got blew my mind!! It was absolutely delicious!!! I could eat it every day of the week!",

    "text": "I ate at this restaurant on Wednesday night about 10:30pm. Every table was full and there were lots of staff around - which I will address later in my review. We started with the Beer Battered onion rings. MISTAKE. They had obviously been fried earlier and the re-dipped in the fryer. They had this weird powder on them which was not Parmesano Reggiano as advertised  it was strangely reminiscent of the green can Parmesan.    Come on Gordon, that would have caused a famous f-bomb and an equally famous spit-out. Now, I know you don't oversee the day to day, but your name's on it so ya gotta own it. These things reminded me of onion rings you would get in a take out that's delivered to your house hours after they are cooked.   My husband had the Specialty fish and crisps burger... or should I say the indistinguishable protein burger drowned in a STRING dill mayo. F-bomb... spit-out.  A specialty ... wow NO.   I, on the other hand, had a perfectly cooked Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was a perfect medium cook, great bun, and just the right amount of sauce to be moist, but not like the fish thing over-sauced.   Now, the restaurant itself and the service. First we waited in line for ten minutes or so and there was this bizarre fire sculpture behind the glass. It was generating enough heat to actually cook the food there. Really!!! It was 95 degrees outside in Vegas so fake fire would have been welcomed.   The service was less than stellar as well, actually it was terrible. We had 4 or maybe 5 different people waiting on us. The guy who took the order and the check and who didn't get a great tip stood on the side and joked around with his friends the whole time. He never checked on our drinks or anything. I chalk that up to management. A well-trained  floor manager would never have let that happen.   My advice... there are lots of great restaurants in Vegas. Find one other than Gordon Ramsey  Burger.",

There was a line of people waiting, but my mom went straight to the front and checked in and they have that text service where they'll just text you when your table is ready so you can walk around instead of waiting in line. So make sure you check in instead of just standing mindlessly in line!  We got a text no more than 5 minutes later that our table was ready. We walked back to the front desk and they made us wait like 15 minutes for a table to be cleaned, and they they got frustrated with my mom for standing at the desk instead of further away which was not cool. I didn't witness it but my mom said the front desk girls were super rude and gave her attitude.  After we got seated the manager came over and apologized for everything that had happened which was nice.  So my family all ordered the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger which was AMAZING. I got the \"F Word\" burger which is actually not on the menu! They only sell 50 a day and it's pricier than the rest of the burgers at $22 instead of $15. It was good, but if I came back I would def get the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but my boyfriend got those fries and he loved them. I got the truffle fries which were delish as well. The fries are like $12 so they're big enough to share between 2 people.  Overall great food and atmosphere.",

    "text": "Had a great first experience the first time so of course I went back. But the second time I went, it was a much different experience.   I had a horrible visit with our server Janet and the manager Eric. If you are looking for great service, this is not the place to go!   After we were seated we ordered waters right away and when she brought them we were ready to order. It took 55 minutes to get our food and when we finally did there was a huge problem. Last time I was there I ordered they turkey burger and loved it so I ordered it again and it looked much different. It looked like chicken this time and last time it more resembled beef. When I questioned Janet, she went on about their spicy chicken patty...listening was just not her thing. She then said that I was probably given beef last time. I asked to speak to the manager. I explained to him the problem and he said there was nothing he can do.  I took a few bites of the burger and did not like it, leaving over half. I told Karen that I did not like it and had lost my appetite and she said \"Excellent, no worries.\" Who says that?!  She then charged me for it and I asked her to take it off because she took it away. She sent Eric to our table and he took her side and told me there was nothing he could do. He then proceeded to get in an argument with me and refused to leave my table when I asked I'm to.   Dont' waste your visit to LV on this place.",

My group of friends and I came out here about a month ago and all six of us agreed that it was the best burger we all had had. Everything was perfect, so much so that a few of us came back to vegas 4 weeks later and decided to make another stop at Ramsay burger and we had an even better expirience than the first time! Our server, Ryan, was amazing! He gave us all some amazing recommendations based on our preferences and made sure we had everything we needed!! Needless to say we will be making an annual pilgrimage to Ramsay burger for our girls trips!",

    "text": "Sorry for the long review, just thought I would explain everything that happened.  So I was flying from Iowa to Sacramento with an overnight stop in Las Vegas. Thought I would stop in at Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant and get a burger.  I got there around 5:00 pm on a Monday and there was no one in line. That was good for 1 star.  Sat down at the counter instead of waiting for a table.  GORDON, GORDON, GORDON!!!  What happened after that was a testament for not eating at the bar.  Ordered a drink, Captain Morgan and Pepsi (they don't have coke, mistake #1), was a little watered down or else Pepsi makes it taste funny.  Ordered the Forest Burger cooked medium and some fries.  Waited about 30 minutes before the burger arrived which is normal for this restaurant.  Ordered another drink just before my food came, Captain Morgan and Pepsi, that is even hard to say. No improvement in the drink, actually was more watered down than the first (mistake #2).  First bite, no pink, no flavor, no rush of \"Whoa, that tastes so good\".  Took a few more bites, no pink whatsoever in that overcooked burger (mistake #3).  The duck bacon was overcooked, but at least the bacon had some flavor along with the mushrooms and cheese.  I slow ate the burger waiting for someone to come over and ask me how the food was.  No one ever asked me how the food tasted or was it cooked right.  There were three of us customers sitting next to each other.  We all got to talking and we all had the same problem, overcooked food and no one asked us about the food.  Back to my situation, the bartender offered me another drink, I declined and said \"I'm good\".   About another 5 minutes later, the bartender finally noticed, which was about 25 minutes after I started eating and said, \"I see you are slowing down there buddy\".  Finally, I get to let them know about the food, which should have happened 3-4 minutes after I received the burger.  I let him know that the burger was overcooked, I still had only eaten about 2/3 of the burger, so it was there to be seen.  He asked, \"Was it cooked medium well\".  I raised my eyebrows and then he said, \"Oh, Well done, eh\".  He then let me know that he would get the manager.  The manager came over asked what the problem was and I proceeded to tell him the burger is way over cooked and had no flavor.  He said I should have let the server know that it was not cooked to my liking. I let him know that the server/bartender never came over and asked me about my food.  I told him, anyone, and I mean anyone, can cook a burger correctly the second time.  I let him know that I was not the only one here at the counter having this problem.  He apologized politely and left (mistake #4).  The bartender came back over to me and asked why I had not told him about the burger.  I let him know that I was waiting for him to ask me about the food and he argued with me that he had asked me earlier. Big Mistake #5!!!!     So my lesson that I learned here was that bartenders are bartenders and not food servers. Don't eat at the bar.  Don't eat here on Mondays, as the part time chef works on Mondays, plus the chef needs to learn the difference between, rare, medium and well done.  Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant gets many 4 & 5 star reviews but not from me. FIVE MISTAKES for one customer, let's see.  How many stars is that worth!  I gave it one star because I got seated right away.  After that, all downhill as they say.  Oh wait.  The bill for the burger, fries and 2 drinks was $51.96.  They gave me a nickel back, so they gave me a penny tip back!!!  I left the nickel....will I be back or eat at a Gordon Ramsey establishment again...time will tell, but not anytime soon. Thanks for listening!!!",

For something called the \"Hell's Kitchen\", I expected there to be some heat, but what I tasted was very mild, almost without any heat.  I think they need to boost up the heat factor. Fries are good, boosted by the excellent spicy ketchups they provide. Overall, everything tasted fine, but nothing special.   There are too many other burger options on the strip for me to give this a high recommendation.",

    "text": "I had a mix of emotions at the beginning. I was very excited to try this place, but was very disappointed that was another open wall restaurant into the casino/hotel. For luxury restaurants, I usually expect a private restaurant experience and I feel like the open places feel too much like mall food and not enough like a luxury restaurant. But the location was great, easy to find and right on the strip.  The atmosphere on the inside was very appropriate for what it was. Thematically he was going for the American/British burger joint and it was set up that way. Large TVs with sports (which don't anything for me, but I thought was smart) and the blue and red color theme. Merchandise and photos of Ramsey made it seem more like a destination dining location and less like a luxury restaurant.  The menu was perfect. Small, to the point, and cute. It had burgers, but also offered vegetarian option for burgers which is highly appreciated, modern and makes the burger menu feel complete.  The service was good. We were seated fairly quickly, food didn't take too long to arrive, we were checked in on and my water stayed full. Nothing complain about! The food itself was played beautifully. My chicken was a bit dry. But I will say that I was very much pleased with the flavor design. The idea of the creme brule milkshake is a brilliant twist on the classic beverages! And it was delicious. My chicken sandwich made me feel like a journey to the Mediterranean and it was almost a gyro burger, but without the tsatziki sauce.  The onion rings also were great and the dipping sauces were good too.",

I wish they would've asked what we preferred or gave options.   My hubs ordered the Hog Burger medium done and enjoyed it more than my Hell's Kitchen Burger. I thought mine was pretty bomb, good flavor balance. They really do medium to perfection!   Since everything's a la carte, we ordered truffle-Parmesan fries and some wings. Truffle n Parmesan fries were aromatic n wings were deboned n delicious; be sure to smear bleu cheese onto each bite.   Finished w a nicely plated blood orange creamsicle, homemade from scratch, that tasted really nice.... except I wasn't sure why it was so soft n melty.  Overall: Great upscale ambience, perfect gourmet burgers n spotless service. Iced teas kept coming before we even thought to ask and our waiter never failed to check on our alcohol situation. Solid place, so glad we tried!",

THE BURGER WAS AMAZING. highly recommend and all my friends were happy with their other burger choices.  OVERALL: i would come again but JUST order a burger and no fries. id love to come back and tries the other sides. trust, the burger is worth the wait.",

    "text": "I had written a review previously for Burger PRE-renovation but after coming here not too long before the renovation in mid-March, I have to admit small details disappointed me on our last visit a few weeks AFTER the renovation, and would disappoint the great Mr. Ramsay himself as well.   My family (fiance, my pregnant sister & her husband, my big sister & her young daughter) and I came during the late afternoon and were told there'd be a 35 minute wait but were actually seated quickly. We noticed there was a slight change in decor and table setup, but for the most part things looked nice and new. At the table we were given the menus and ipad.   IMMEDIATELY my sisters noticed that their favorite jalapeno poppers were abolished. Lol. New burgers were introduced but they kept my favorite Hell's Kitchen, and changed up the farm burger to a farmhouse, with a different cheese. Basic sides were the same. I thought I'd like to try the forest burger next.   We were waiting a solid 15 minutes before our server came and asked what we would like to drink. She was busy I could tell but I felt that she was also flying through everything, NOT in a good way. As a former server I could just feel the tension from her juggling us, adding us to her pile of mounting mental madness.   We ordered quickly (my sisters pushing for them poppers to no avail), and then waited a lengthy 40 minutes for our food. When our food came, presentation was not as it had been before. My fiance had a piece of old cheese melted and stuck to his plate from either another plate or from a bad dishwashing. Our server had also forgotten one order of fries which we waited til the end of our meal for. We all needed refills for tea a few minutes into our entrees because they had not been filled after we had gotten them.  Although I have had the Hell's Kitchen burger a few times previously, it wasn't the same as it used to be. I feel like in the name of profit, the restaurant has become more for tourists and not for taste. Before, whenever we got our bill I had always thought \"I can't believe I'm paying so little for such a great meal and time.\" Now, when we got the bill I thought \"This is just another typical Strip Burger joint bill for a typical Strip Burger experience\". Which is sad, because it had always been a place we loved to go for a treat on the Strip every other month or so, and whenever we had friends or family in town.   Needless to say, we all won't be returning. Sorry, Gordon.",

I  complained to the Manager, trying to be much more gracious than Gordon Ramsay. He as well claimed no accountability. I'm writing this YELP review, trying to be much more gracious than Gordon Ramsay. Either Gordon Ramsay has no idea what is going on at this restaurant or he is a SHAM.",

The reason for the 3 star rating was the way they pile up extra charges without letting you know.  After my kids ordered their plain ole hamburgers the witness asked if they wanted mushroom or bacon. They, being kids said, \"ok\".......They don't tell you that that added $16 to the bill by doing that. Actually they way she mentioned it I too assumed it was part of the meal, she never said that it was extra, but then again I live in Vegas and know how they underhandedly gouge visitors. Shameful.

I tried the chicken tikka burger without the bun, and loved the spices! I would order this again.

Not that the burger was terrible or anything, but all the fancy ingredients left me with a pretty average experience. The anniversary burger was pretty flavorless, despite the aged steak used to make the burger. The hog burger was a little better, being juicier and better seasoned.   The Irish nachos we had as an appetizer were absolutely amazing!! The corned beef was savory and sweet, and the cheese sauce that drenched the nachos was divine.

On August 9, 2019 I went to this restaurant. Before I got in line I spoke with 1 of the hostesses and asked her the process. She told me that I could just get in line because I was by myself. If a spot opened at the bar, they would come through the line and ask if someone wanted to sit at the bar. Okay, so I rolled myself in line. Twice they came by asking me if I wanted to sit at the bar, and I declined. Finally, after waiting in line for 35-40 minutes I was next. It was then that 1 of the hostesses informed me that they didn't have a table to accommodate me, I had to leave my scooter outside the restaurant (policy) or wait an hour to be seated. When I asked why wasn't I told this in the beginning she said, \"you didn't ask.) I pointed out several places inside that I felt safe leaving my scooter and she said \"no\" to each one. (Meanwhile, she also instructed other hostesses to seat my intended table) When I asked to speak with management,  she said I could park it in one of the spots I had asked about. I waited 15 more minutes and was seated. There were many tables that were wheelchair accessible, including the one I sat at. Now, to the food. My server was Paul and he was wonderful!! Very attentive. Everything is a la cart, I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger & onion rings. Excellent!! They said the burger was spicy \"hot,\" I didn't think so. It was so good, I ate the avocado, and I don't like avocados. They had every kind of cheese I hadn't heard of, but it was good. The onion rings were so good, not overly breaded. I would love to go again, as long as I don't have to encounter that hostess again.",

    "text": "I was really impressed with this upper scale burger joint. My boyfriend and I got seated immediately on a Thursday night around 10pm. It was pretty packed but I think because we were a party of 2 was the only reason we got seated quickly. I would recommend calling ahead for bigger parties. I didn't order any of the alcohol because it looked over priced and small- it did look delicious though! I figured I could save money by not ordering a drink from here because the burgers start at $15. Which brings me to the burgers!! The burger was absolutely delightful and was super filling. I had mine with dubliner cheese and that was possibly the best cheese ever! I think every burger should have dubliner cheese from now on haha I'm hooked! I would say the pricing is a little silly but it's Vegas and Gordon Ramsey has his name on it so it's kind of expected to pay $15 for a hamburger. *Warning** The burgers do not come with fries. The fries are $8. I chose not to order the fries because I noticed that the kitchen premakes them and then puts the $8 fries under a heat lamp...basically the fries aren't fresh. I refused to pay $8 for a small thing of fries that are just sitting under a heat lamp..no thank you, I'll pass. If you are going strictly for a burger - this is the place for you.  If you are concerned about money - this place is NOT for you.  If you want to eat at a cool burger joint because you love burgers- this is the place for you. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I really liked my waiter. He always made sure my water was never empty and that's always scores points with me.",

I am sure no one would face higher criticism if something with his name on it disappointed in any way since he seems to know everything related to food, restaurant, service...  I am happy to say this was 100% and I could see Gordon actually eating here. Yes it was busy since we were in town on Labor Day Weekend. The food is better than I could have imagined, the service was great especially considering how busy it was. (just over a 2 hour wait)   If you are thinking \"maybe\" treat yourself.",

I mean horrible... the burger (crown burger) was so dry I had to slather mayo and ketchup on it. Just wrong!!! From Gordon local I expect much more. I understand they had a chef missing, but that's unacceptable. And yes, to not comp us anything or a free drink, is not right. Service was mediocre at the bar. Overall dissatisfied. Will not be back.   UPDATE: They had us come back and with new management and lots of updates I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. Thank you for accommodating us and showing us how service & food can be fixed",

    "text": "While in Vegas we checked out Gordon Ramsay Burger. I read on their website that they serve Creekstone beef so I was excited. Creekstone is known for humane slaughter and care of animals. I called ahead to confirm this as well. While waiting in line for a seat we were asked if we'd like the front row seats of the kitchen with the chance to view the chefs. It was a nice opportunity especially because our waiter was able to point to dishes that were made and ready to go in order to show us what certain dishes looked like.  We tried the curry chips which are basically French fries that come with a curry dipping sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of either one. The fries were not crispy enough and the sauce had wayyyyy too much turmeric (trust me I'm Indian). I had the Hell's burger and my husband had the Crown burger. Both were delicious. Unfortunately my husband's burger was not medium rare as he requested. It was over cooked on the sides. The burger buns were all the same for all burgers, multigrain (mostly sesame seeds).  Towards the end it was hard to get our waiter's attention because it got busier for the dinner rush. I recommend coming at maybe 3-5 pm to avoid the rush!",

They came out fairly quickly, maybe 2 minutes from ordering them.  It came with a good amount of short rib and corned beef but thought it was a little underseasoned.  For our burgers, my boyfriend ordered the farmhouse burger cause he really wanted an egg and I ordered the anniversary burger (aged rib eye patty topped with short rib).  Burgers were juicy but we both thought they were just ok.  Our server was very friendly but had to wait around since she was busy.

    "text": "Gordon Ramsay just can't stand to disappoint his customers. Because his food is memorable and definitely an experience. First I tried the Cheddar ale soup. It was the perfect balance of beer and cheese. The bitterness from the beer just added to the creaminess is of the cheese. It's summer now, but on a cold winter night, I'd probably search this soup out to warm me from my bones. Then I got the blue burger while my friends ordered the ultimate cheeseburger and the Forrest Burger. All three of us said that are burgers were the best we'd ever had. The blue burger had the bite of blue cheese mixed with the sweetness of the figgy jam and saltiness of the meet. But the food item that got the most comments? Fries. Truffle fries literally melted in your mouth. The truffle oil actually added to the fries instead of overpowering them. The ambiance was warm and friendly. The staff answered any and all questions and their uniforms are great (jeans). The fire decoration near the door and the barrels if beer really give you that feeling of being near a barn and ready to have a fantastic pub meal. As with all of his restaurants... I'd go again.",

Next time I'll try the veggie burger called The Impossible and ask for it to be served in pita bread instead of the bun. Don't take me wrong, the bun was amazing, but the pita bread was absolutely the best! The wait was just 5 mins and the staff was first class. Loved it!",

Once a couple years ago and we remembered the burgers as being excellent so now that we moved to vegas this was on my list of places to go back to but was thoroughly disappointed. It was about a half hour wait to be seated, then another 40 minutes to be served our food.  We ordered 2 burgers and 1 regular fries and 1 truffle fries. They have 3 different ketchups and all tasted bad. The normal ketchup tasted plane. Didn't like the truffle fries at all and the normal fries were ok...but McDonalds fries taste better. Their ranch was so so but not great.  We ordered the ultimate cheeseburger and the Hells kitchen burger. The hell's kitchen burger was ok but lacked flavor. The ultimate cheeseburger had little to no flavor. I asked for a side of tomatoes, pickles, jalepenos, and lettuce. None of these added much flavor to the burger.   Honestly In-N-Out has a much tastier burger for $3 vs $17 at Gordon Ramsey and you don't have to wait forever to eat it either.",

I could only finish half of the burger. * Shake: if you can't comprehend a cup full of sugar then don't. 60% of the shake is the thick, overly sweet cream brulee cream, the rest is oreo shake.   I still give it 5 stars because I really like how the food is cooked. I will come back to try other burgers, and more truffle fries!",

    "text": "Yep... Gordon Ramsay knows what he's doing, but was there really any doubt? The burgers were seriously fantastic. Came here on a double date and we all ordered different burgers so we could try a little of each other's. Each of them were excellent as well as the drinks. I ordered the antioxidant one. I cannot stress enough how delicious all of our burgers were so which ever one you choose to order will probably be delicious.  There was a really long line, but... there was a sign that said for parties of \"three or more\" to see the hostess. We did and boy am I glad we can read. They put us on a different list for bigger parties and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time without having to wait in that long line we initially saw. So we gambled a bit more and were then texted when our table was ready. We waited approximately 30 minutes total and if you saw the original wait line, it looked like a busy day at Disneyland so 30 minutes was great in our minds. They don't take reservations either so FYI.   I honestly can't wait to go back the next time we're in Vegas. The burgers are so worth the wait.",

I had some uninvited guests in the form of stone/broken chicken bone spec. When asked about it to the waiter he was kind enough to send his manager to speak to us and imagine what, I was told that these kind of things can be possible and sounded so obvious.  My question would be, who would have been responsible if I broke my tooth trying to chew that bone? Gordon Ramsay or his manager?   Before I was assigned my table, I saw almost all tables having fries so I thought it might be the best item in the menu. I think it should have been named as wedges instead of fries. Moreover when they were served they were not served hot. Not sure when they were prepared.

Our server was very prompt and got us our drinks (he got a beer and I got the jalapeno 'rita) right away and we got our onion ring appetizer within 5 minutes.  Our burgers and fries arrived at 5:36.   The burger was cooked beautifully and was very tasty, but not nearly as spicy as we were hoping (Hells' Kitchen burger). We love spice and were just a little let down about that, but the overall flavor of the burger was very good. We got one order of fries to split and that was enough for both of us, and they were cooked well.   I decided I couldn't leave without trying a creme brulee milkshake, and I was not disappointed with the Oreo one. It was delicious and generous enough to share if you feel like it.   I mention the times we arrived and were served because this was the FASTEST food we had gotten anywhere in Vegas during our entire stay there, and the food was delicious.  When I saw how packed the place was, I was expecting a long wait for food and was pleasantly surprised.",

After taking our water order, we didn't receive them until 10 minutes later. He apologized. We placed our dinner order which seemed to be pretty easy, but then we waited another 45 minutes.... it was 11:45pm. I was watching Andre to see whether he acknowledged what was going on, but he seemed to busy at the cashiers processing payments and checking his tips. I checked their yelp page and it said they closed at midnight. so at that point I searched for a manager, I stressed how upset I was and that we had been waiting forever and he just apologized and we walked out. Worst service I have ever had! Especially for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Was definitely looking forward to the food and it was a complete let down. I highly DO NOT recommend this place.",

I know this is not a cocktail bar, but an Old Fashioned is probably the most basic cocktail and at $16 each, I would expect them to get it right. I would expect Gordon would not be happy with the product they are delivering in his name. Consistency and accuracy are his hallmarks.",

They don't take reservations, but our party was fairly large and we needed a handicap-friendly table so they made an exception. We were there on a Sunday around noon and the line was about a 30 minute wait. We stayed at Planet Hollywood (where the restaurant is located) and the line was always long when we saw it.  I had the Tandoori Chicken Burger- every bite was so flavorful. And that goes for literally everything our party of 10 had. Our favorites were the Kettle Chip Nachos and Truffle Parmesan Fries. Seriously sooo delicious! I swear every bite my whole family would look at each other and say how good it is lol.  Service was 10/10 too. Crazy busy, but they still brought our food quickly and checked up on us often. Overall, an amazing dining experience! :)",

It comes in a super thick pork patty, wrapped in bacon, topped with shredded pork. They should've given more Cole slaw. I couldn't finish the pork patty because it was so thick and so I left it on the plate and the smell of it was making me noxious. Very strong pork smell. Everything was just mediocre.

    "text": "It is hard to walk into a restaurant without any expectation when you see one of the most famous names in restaurant business. Walking into Gordon Ramsay Burger, my expectations were very very high. Once you are seated you are greeted with a table setting that reminds you of the British Flag with and a simple menu on top with very minimalistic fonts with the name of the restaurant. The physical Menu it self even felt like there was a lot of thought, design elements and interaction put into it compared to a regular menu at majority of the restaurants. The drinks and dessert are on a separate tablet menu the server brings that seems a bit out of place and don't see the use for but I feel like its because of the limited space on their actual menu.    On to the food. I had the Anniversary Burger which also seems like the F-Word burger that wasn't on the menu. The patty is a blend of 27-day, dry-aged New York strip, Bone in ribeye and barbecue short rib. It's topped with frisee, pickled shallots and lemon vinaigrette. It seems like the design isn't very sophisticated and I like how simple yet flavorful it is. People might ask whats the point of all the best meat in a patty, you won't taste it.. but the truth is it made a whole lot of difference. you can actually taste the dry aged and the quality of meat in each bite. Parmesan Truffle fries are cooked to perfection with subtle yet enough seasoning and flavor of both Truffle and Parmesan in every bite of the Fries. It is hands down one of the best gourmet burgers I've had.    Service is a bit slow due to the place being so damn busy but it's understandable since the place was jam packed. The only gripe about this place is the waiting system. We had 5 people in our party and they were kind enough to take down our number and text us when our table was ready but for party of 2 or less, They said you have to physically wait in line. Though we didn't have to wait in line, this just didn't make any sense to me. If you already have a system of where you can take peoples name and phone number down, why can't you do that for everyone so they can go enjoy a little bit of Vegas instead of waiting in line next to a window full of flames?    Price is a bit high for a burger at $22 but I understand as it's hard to find anything to eat with less than $20 at a sit down restaurant in the stip of Las Vegas.    Regardless of the wait, and what other people may say, I personally enjoyed every bite of my burger and it was a extraordinary burger. it is definitely worth the try. c'mon it says Gordon Ramsay and how often do you have the opportunity to walk into a restaurant with his name in front.",

I loved the batter on the onion rings but not the Parmesan cheese they added on top....it made it too salty. Service was outstanding. I would eat there again.",

As we arrived, there was a long line. The host was going down the line taking names. For a party of 3 or more you do not have to wait in line. They write down your cell phone number and call you as soon as a table is ready.  Wait was 1hr. 40min.  Finally we sat down!!!  Restaurant looks very clean and Nice decor.  Ordered 3 Hells Burgers and 1 hot dog.   Took about another 30-45 min. For our food to come out! A total of almost 4 hours from the time we checked in to the time we left. Wow!!!   My Party and I where really Disappointed!   $15 Burger does not come with a side.  We ordered a side of wedges and onion rings.   \"Hells Burger\" the description seemed like if it would be a spicy burger includes jalapenos and avocado. Nope!!! The presentation was really nice, but my burger was tasteless, it needed something, no sauce, I did not taste like jalapeno, it just needed something. It just seemed like a burger I could have prepared myself at home.   Fries and onion rings, nothing special.    Hot dog is huge, but nothing special.   They don't offer a children's menu.   I was just expecting way more. I have had a way better burger somewhere else for cheaper, with a side, and without the almost 2 hour wait.   I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "For a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, a guy so quickly bitches at everyone, and expects perfection and if he doesn't get it, he is ready to chop your head off....going to his restaurant was a major let down.   This is actually my second visit and it was equally disappointing but I wrote first one off as \"it can happen to anyone, let's give it another chance\".   Burger patty itself was ok - but flavor combination of my burger was excellent. I ordered Blue Cheeseburger and really the combo complimentary flavors were amazing. Bun was really good too.   Beyond that everything else was awful.   I came by myself just to grab a burger and the line was maybe 30 people - mostly two party groups. I walked up to the front and saw that bar had about 5 empty seats and also kitchen bar had 5 empty seats. I asked if I could just sit there and she said no. So I went to the line and waited for the actual table. If I am going to wait for 40 min might as well get an actual table. As I waited I heard other single parties that would be ok with the bar but they had to wait as well. I am just trying to imagine Ramsey screaming at some restaurant owner for having 10 seats available at the bar while 30 people wait.   40min later when it's my turn she tells me that there is room at the bar if I want to sit there.  I was like - No - I waited 40min I am not sitting at the bar now. So I wait another 10min and she gives me a table next to the bar (maybe 3ft from it) in the middle of the walkway. So people are constantly buzzing around me. I don't understand why they put the table in this location. You feel like you are always on everyone's way.   Besides that after waiting 15min to get my order I am now freezing because it's in a passthrough so you can feel the cold air from door opening. Now it's 25 min later and I am shivering. I ask one of the managers dressed in a suit to move to a different table, because I am really cold. And he says No.  there are some tables available but he said they may be turning them into 6 tops later.   So I wait for my burger eat it while shivering and leave. Meanwhile those tables that they were going to eventually convert into 6 tops and about 10 other tables in the back of the restaurant where it's not cold and you can't feel the outside breeze, were all empty when I left. This was all on a Monday at 2:30ish PM not a prime busy day or hour.   So basically I paid $37 for burger and fries (no drink) $15 for parking - totaling $52 for a hamburger that was ok, and I was treated like dirt.   If any restaurant owner charged $50+ for a burger and the customer left rushed, freezing, and uncomfortable he would be screaming at them. I guess I can only conclude Ramsey keeps others to a different standard than himself.   As a side note - the first time I came I was seated next to the cash register. My left elbow was touching the register side. Which felt like a train stations since all the servers were coming consistently.",

The foie gras burger was definitely the best burger I've ever eaten, but there were two things that bugged me about my visit. The glass that my beer was served in was not very clean, and had visible food residue from the previous customer on it. I'm pretty sure I got sick from it, and looking back I should have asked for a new glass, but it was pretty hard to get a hold of our waiter. Speaking of which, it took nearly 20 minutes for our waiter to come collect our bill. It was a busy day, but I feel like a restaurant with a high-profile name like Gordon Ramsay on the front should be able to handle a full load of customers with little to no difficulty.   Overall I was satisfied with the food, but the service and cleanliness could definitely be improved upon.",

There are a ton of workers buzzing but hardly come around - even just to refill water, let alone order. Fries are thick-cut, and average. Burger was good....but worth $15...no, however they did cook it to a great medium-rare. Curried shrimp salad was big for $15 with lots of shrimp and spiced well.

The line moved depressingly slow -- mostly due to the fact that they gave priority for reward card holders.   We ordered onion rings ($9), Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and the UK burger ($15), and a beer ($8). The onion rings came out pretty good, and fast, though $9 is overpriced for onion slices and batter. Both the UK and the Hell's Kitchen burger were decadent and pretty tasty but I was a bit disappointed, I guess I expected more, like more complex flavors. Also, a few bites into the Hell's Kitchen burger, I realized that the avocado was missing. We were sitting at the counter top, so I called the nearest waitress over and told her about the missing ingredient. Without saying anything she went over to the set up table and handed me a small ramekin with a small avocado sliced, said maybe a curt sorry, and hurried away. Even our waitress took a good 10-15 minutes to get us our check after we finished. They all seem so busy that, other than the water boy that came over frequently to refill out glasses, I don't feel like we've been given enough attention.",

My husband was in the middle of eating his. I contacted the manager. I informed her I waited for the burger to be cooked and I an in the restaurant so why was my burger not hot. She was accommodating and I waited for another burger to be cooked. The second won was hot. She said they have to be at a certain temperature. I understand but it still should be hot. It seemed it was pre cooked an d tossed on the grill to heat up but not hot all the was through. I love burger from medium well to well done. This on was requested well done. I had sauteed onions and no bacon or fancy topping added to it.  I didn't see anything special about the burger but  a bit over priced for the name.",

(This is driving me nuts, I know it used to have no E!).  We look forward to this and make this place a stop each time in Vegas. The burgers really are that good.  The wait this time was ridiculous, over 2 hours at some times!  Luckily on Friday at about 6pm the line was only 30 minutes so we again got our burger groove on.  Our server (can't remember his name) but he was spot on, super friendly and helpful and very attentive.  It's hard to have this type of attitude when a place is as busy as this place is so kudos to great service.   The only downside to this visit is that some of the past menu items are gone.  :-(   No more Euro burger, it was a favorite and the new lineup of shakes is missing some of the old and best ones!  We actually declined on getting a shake this time due to there only being 2 offered that just did not sound so great.  We never get the fries as they are really expensive and quite frankly better at any Habit Burger.  Nothing special with them at all.  Sorry Gordon, the chips just ain't happening.  I wish the server would have told me that the \"house wine\" was $14 per glass when I ordered it, I might have changed my mind as it was really nothing special.  I guess I should learn to ask first.  Burgers = A+",

We asked our bartender/waitress how much longer for our food & she asked where I tab was, we told her she never gave us one, she forgot to put our food order in.

Kind of jealous I didn't order a more traditional burger. The table ordered & shared fries, sweet potato fries & onion rings. The fries were all thick cut crispy outside & pillowy delish potato on the inside & the dipping sauces were yum. The onion rings had a crispy beer batter & also a couple of traditional dipping sauces. The cocktails were as delicious as the were strong.

One of the worst burger and fries I've ever had.  Simple order, a cheeseburger no bun with a side of avocado and a fried egg, that's it!   I got a piece of meat that tasted like it came from Safeway, a soft boiled egg not even on the burger, and I kid you not a sliver of avocado.  Server agreed it was ridiculous and did the right thing.  Go Elsewhere, hek even the salad at the hotel cafe had 2 pieces of avocado!",

    "text": "First impression wasn't great. While waiting in a line sucks, watching others constantly skip the line is frustrating. You can skip the line too we were told - if you let the casino open a credit card in your name.  This means that while you're told 20 minute wait you're really standing in like for nearly an hour, in front of a roasting gas flame too (to give the Hell's Kitchen aesthetics, but is terrible placement for a line). I have to point this out the lines wait because while we were waiting at end of the line the hostesses continued to tell people 20 minutes and I'd keep interjecting \"we've been waiting nearly an hour\" so those people's expectations could be more accurate. It felt they were being disingenuous to people who may have plans/shows to go to. In the end they also stopped offering people tables (except to those skipping the line) and could only offer chefs bar seating.  Once we sat down for the meal it was prepared quickly however my party agreed the burgers were really nothing special. My own Hell's Kitchen burger was kinda ruined by the half-an-avocado which just kind of slides out as you try to eat, pulling the toppings out.  The one great aspect of the food was the truffle fries and onion rings. Those truly were great, and we agreed we're worth waiting in line.  Unfortunately at the end of the night the computers all went down and no one had any orders or bills so waitresses had to go around asking for orders again to calculate bills - then said people needed to pay with cash or else they'd need to go find those carbon-copy mechanical-slide credit card machines. Wasnt a great final impression.",

Once sat, the first comments out of the waitresses mouth were \"prepare to wait another 40 minutes to get your burger\" We ordered drinks right away but it took 15 to 20 minutes to get those to us. The staff appeared to be unorganized. Our waitress was inattentive, not really checking in with us at all. After 40 minutes we recieved our burgers which were cooked perfectly and very delicious, however overall was not a good experience. Plates could use some updating as the Gordon Ramsey logo was very worn.",

So the highlight of the meal is definitely the onion rings!  Amazing. I would go back just for them. Fries were mediocre at best (way better at Pub). The ketchups are interesting... I would have preferred regular- but they don't have it (eye roll). The burgers were cooked well, nothing special. The HK burger had really good/hot green chile - and I'm from New Mexico and know my green chile. The peppers on it (poblano?). I could have definitely done without. Shakes were amazing as well!  Filling!!",

    "text": "This was our second time eating at this location. Our first was a year ago. Last year we enjoyed it. We ate lunch and had generous portioned salads that were fresh and good. On Sun. night Sept.9, 2018 we arrived at 9:00. We had about a 40 minute wait in a line. My husband loves good burgers. I don't eat a lot of meat but was confident that I could find something to eat. They have 4 salads, one with curried shrimp. I wanted something hot, not a cold salad. On the menu, above the burger Iist I read, \"substitute the Vegetarian Impossible Burger Patty for an additional $6. Since the hamburgers range in price from $15-$22 that is ridiculous! One is being punished for not eating meat. So...I ordered the only other thing which was A Fish and Crisps Burger for $16. When it came it was not hot but warmish. Cod is supposed to be flaky and WHITE. This was mushy and had a lot of tan- brownish color inside. I really don't think it was very fresh or cooked with much attention. I told my husband who is very knowledgeable about fish. He tried it and said it wasn't good. I left half on the plate. I never did discover what the crisps were. They were on top of the sandwich. So basically it was fish with crunch on top....NOTHING ELSE ON IT--NO TARTAR, NO MAYO, NO LETTUCE. NO TOMATO! What were the crisps??? Not French fried onions. They had no flavor. Not good alone or on the fish. If you look closely at their burgers, the huge buns are to deceive you into thinking you're getting a gigantic burger. Not really the case.We won't go back! Too many other great spots. This is my first review of a restaurant. Couldn't ignore! Waiter was nice, but never filled our drinks or asked if things were ok.",

Taste was great but had a lot of fat and cartilage on it. If you like lean white meat it won't suit your tastes. Or maybe that was just our order.   Truffle park fries complemented the burger well. Also they have an impressive beer list which was great. They also carry la fin du monde on draft which was a nice surprise.",

Next.....we noticed many ordering the creme brulee oreo shake, so of course we tried the creme brulee oreo shake and it also lived up to the goodness of this place! It was pricey, $75 for 2 burgers, fries, shake and a beer, not including the tip; but it was very much worth it. It's Vegas....so $75 on lunch vs a slot machine is a win for me!",

The bar tender (Robert) was less than attentive and doesn't remember an order. Doesn't know the menu either, when asked what is in one of the menu items, he couldn't recall. As a professional bartender one of the BIGGEST skills needed is the ability to mingle with the clientele, to start and carry on conversations to help pass the time and also entertain a little. For some reason the ART of suggestive selling to help guide the guest through an experience has been lost.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger Medium Rare (The only way to order a burger)at 17:45(according to the time on the ticket) delivered at 18:19 (time on my phone when it arrived)wow what a long time. It was cooked to Medium Rare+ (just on the outside cusp of Medium Rare edging towards Medium). The flavor profile was somewhat bland with the exception of the mild heat from the roasted jalapeno and roasted tomato. The beef had absolutely no flavor. The fries were warm (not hot) and quickly cooled to a spongy soft potato. The flavor of salt and herb quickly disbursed. No follow up to insure the meal was prepared to satisfaction nor was a follow performed for either of the two guest sitting next to me.  The 2 guest sitting next to me were also displeased with their experience as we entered into a conversation about their experience after I spoke up and mentioned an incident to a bartender (explained below). I informed a bartender that the guest to my left burger was over cooked and the bartender seemed dumbfounded and when I explained what a medium temperature should look like the bartenders response was \"I don't know, I'm just a bartender\". Wow - that really sealed it for me. My experience was ruined.. A moment later the guest was asked if they wanted to have the manager come by.(WOW really!! There should be NO question there a manager should have been informed immediately without asking anyone)  To add insult to injury, when a different bartender uses a bar towel to wipe his head and then leave the towel for future use on the bar that kind of turns my stomach. When I confronted that bartender his reply was (I wasn't using it) then I explained that he had JUST wiped down the back bar top with that very same towel  he just turned, shook his head in disapproval and said OK and took the towel and put it away.   Overall, this experience was disappointing and only confirmed by the disappointment with 2 other guests dinning at the same time. It is obvious that Mr. Ramsey no longer is involved in this concept and the company that now owns the restaurant is milking the name for all they can. Overpriced drinks ($15 for a cocktail), poor quality of product and execution along with a poor service level brings this experience to a close.  I was SO looking for a great experience like the one I remembered from years past. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It causes concern for my next experience coming up Ramsey's Prime Steak House (I have reservations in a couple of days)..",

So I assumed it would be amazing. We each got a burger and we told the hostess to put it to go  because There was a long wait for a table . But what I didn't know is that our food literally took  like 40 minutes or more. Once we got it we saw that it didn't come with fries or chips or anything. Just a big box for a plain tiny burger. That doesn't have a taste to it and the worst part is that it was raw in the centerof the meat. I was so disappointed especially for the price that you pay for it. I guess i was just paying for his name.",

To start with, a moist succulent pork patty wrapped in bacon topped with slow smoked/ braised pork brisket with melted white cheddar sandwiched between toasted seeded buns. Cabbage tarragon mayo slaw coupled with crispy onions flavored with garlic, paprika, and cayenne as delectable toppings. Bread and butter pickles cutting through the saltiness of the bacon and sweetness of the brisket, completes the scrumptious package. Hog burger is definitely an ambrosial experience to relish in spite the long line to get in.   Gordon Ramsay Burger at Planet Hollywood is an urban casual spot for a gourmet burger with ambiance mirroring the peppy energy of Vegas.   Recommended, Cheers!!!!",

I also ordered their speciality cocktail which was a cinnamon pear sangria, I wish I could order this drink everywhere! It tasted amazing. All in all a great experience here!

When I went to the front desk, the person in charge was rude and dismissive. I asked why if I had called less than 6min ago they didn't inform me that it would be a 40min wait with a possibility that they would close before my family and I could go in. He stated \"I don't know why someone would say that, this like has been that big all day today.\" And walked away without a knife ounce of acknowledgment that Jessica had messed up and furthered ruined our plans.

I wasn't sure if I was eating seafood or sausage the consistency and flavor were that bad, it was unrecognizable, If it was truly Lobster and Shrimp it was over cooked to rubber consistency ....

Parking was terrible but that's to be expected I guess. The decor was great. A wall on fire, multiple tvs. But why is it so squished? They truly tried to fit as many tables as they possibly could in here. Since it was the 2 of us we were seated within a minute. The waiter (I think his name was Sergio, I feel bad to have forgotten) was awesome. He let us know the burger would be at least half an hour, so we went ahead and ordered Just fries, truffle Parmesan fries, and the mushroom poutine. The just fries and the mushroom poutine came out first. The fries was deliciously crispy and lightly salted. I wasn't a big fan of their curry ketchup nor the Chipotle ketchup. The mushroom poutine was so bland! All of the toppings, and honestly had no flavor at all. Our waiter made no deal at all about taking it back and the manager came out to apologize and ask if he could get us anything else, so we asked for the sweet potato fries. Ommgggg. They come with a vanilla powdered sugar with its own shaker. SO BOMB. We ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and it came out at the same time as the truffle Parmesan fries. No words. The meat was juicy and just as I ordered, medium well. The chunk of avocado was perfectly ripe and had no imperfections. The avocado sauce it had was full of flavor. The bun was perfectly toasted and soft. The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing!! Bursting with flavor, perfectly crispy! We ended our meal with the chocolate creme brulee shake. Wow. Speechless. The chocolate shake was rich,decadent. I don't even like chocolate ice cream but wow. Our ending total was $68, so for the average person it is pricey, but honestly worth it. The customer service was incredible and I hope they continue to treat every customer the way we were treated.",

I have always loved you proficiency, this is not what I accepted from you professional standards. They told us 30min we waited 55min and there where 10 tables open. We were only a part of 2 and 4 parties of 8-12 went before us. What the fuck happened. Sort this out! Horrible just horrible! Rude staff that didn't give to cents about the eager paying customers. Please come down and whip some ass. Turn over the greeting staff ASAP!",

We stood there waited to be seated and not one addressed us and ask how many. We looked like idiots standing there until my girlfriend utter maybe we should just go somewhere else. It was then, one of the girls turned around and seated us. Our waiter was good but the lack of service from the beginning really sour the experience. I ordered the farm burger, truffle fries, and wings. Farm burger had no taste, wings was cold, and truffle fries taste old. Aside from our waiter, we would have given this a negative 2 stars. Not what we expected for a Ramsey restaurant.",

You get to skip the line for a table if you have diamond or seven star casino status which is great, cause this place is always packed and rightfully so!   Service has been great both times I've been, once at a table and once at the bar. Staff is attentive. Also, attention to detail. When you arrive, the menus/cutlery is displayed the same way. When you get your plate, it is faced with the Gordon Ramsay logo facing you. Small details make allllll the difference!   The onion rings are HUGE and the portion size is fantastic for the money. Def enough for two. I like the touch of the parmesan cheese dusting and the ranch is great, prob made in-house.   Had the blue burger and its pretty incredible. Great pairing of flavors, but even more impressive is the beef! Meat is flavorful and the cook has been on POINT! The medium rare has been perfect twice which is arguably the most important thing to me. Toppings come and p, but the meat should be the star and if it's not cooked right, what is the point??   Will be back next time I'm here. Keep saying I'm gonna try Holstein's, but I can't seem to not go to this place!! Good problem to have!",

The garlic truffle fries ($12) were amazing, I have never tried such a delicious fry. Everything went so well together and the atmosphere was super chill and relaxed. Our waiter, Justin, was super nice and friendly. The creme brulee shake ($10) I got was aaaaammmmaaazzzzzzing..... best burgers. Best fries. Best shakes. I'm pretty sure everything they serve here tastes out of this world. Whenever I watch Gordon Ramsay on tv now I feel like I can taste what he's making and it's awesome lol. Such a great experience, especially if you're a Gordon Ramsay fan, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Given that Gordon Ramsay's restaurants have been awarded 16 Michelin stars in total and currently hold a total of 7...there are expectations for going to a restaurant that has his name on it.  This may explain why lines tend to be longer for this place, but don't get me wrong--it is tolerable (15-30 mins) and for good reasons.  They change their menu design frequently, entrance/line area have a beautiful fire display behind glass walls to enjoy while waiting.  Atmosphere and uniform are cute.  Prices are fair.  They run about $15/burger and sides are ordered like appetizers, with a variety of sauces.    All the food I've had have tasted great.  They also tweek their menu throughout the year, so certain things that you may have had last year may not be available this year (RIP my beloved nutella shake).  The hog burger is good if you're a fan of bacon.  The foie gras was alright...a little too gamey for my preference, but for those who aren't quite as sensitive, you guys might enjoy this a bit more than I do.  The Farm burger is great as well.  The patties for all burgers are always cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning and savory juiciness.  Textures are always great because they're packed with toppings...if you're a plain cheeseburger/hamburger type,  you will most likely not like this place.  I also enjoyed their salads--great flavor while being relatively healthy.  Overall, I'd recommend coming here if you want a decent burger.  I'd also recommend asking the servers for the advice if you're uncertain about items--they're very knowledgeable and service is great.  You can also customize if there are a couple burgers you're in between!  P.S.  They do a military discount!  You're welcome.",

When I finally got it, it was worth the wait.  I ordered the just fries and the forest burger.   The burger was cooked to perfection and had just enough toppings of fresh mushrooms and cheese. The bun has a nicely seeded top and grilled.  The just fries come with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.   The curry is my fave!  Fun loud atmosphere!",

There's an aioli and a cheese that was amazing, and the mushroom (you get two caps) is juicy and flavorful. Even the thinly sliced vegetables were good, mostly because they added crunch. The bun was soft, and the sesame seeds, for the first time, actually added to the flavor.  - garlic parm. fries: not as crispy as I would have liked. The texture is more of a soft, chewy, thick-cut fries. The dips- wondrous.  On a Saturday night around 11pm- no wait. Caveat: this was not a popular weekend.  Service: friendly.",

    "text": "My return to Gordon Ramsay Burger...formerly known as Burgr when I last visited. Not only did the restaurant get a name change but it added a lot more burgers and appetizers to the menu. Me and my co workers dove into drinks then it was straight to ordering entrees.  We started with the burnt ends poutine and the kettle chip nachos. Those who are fans of black pepper will love the burnt ends poutine. You get a lot of black pepper flavor from the gravy as well as sweet from the pickled onions making it a sweet and savory dish. The kettle chip nachos takes the crown of the two appetizers. The chips are topped with both shredded corned beef and short rib. It's also topped with a flavorful cheddar sauce in contrast to cheese curds on the poutine. The flavors of the three combined were awesome.   For my main I ordered the lobster and shrimp burger. Like the poutine, this burger was a combination of sweet and savory. You get the savoriness from the patty which is made from both lobster and rock shrimp meat while the sweet comes from the pickled onions. There's also some zestiness from the herb aioli. None of the fixings takes away from the patty allowing the flavors of the lobster and shrimp to be front and center. I enjoyed it a lot, too bad there isn't a double patty lobster and shrimp burger haha.   Different name but still the same great food with new additions. I'll be returning as always to get through parts of the menu I've yet to try.  Dinner 4/3/2018",

    "text": "I was scared this place wasn't going to live up to the hype but it definitely did ! We waited about 45 minutes in line which went by pretty quickly. The star of the show for me was the burnt ends short rib poutine!! The sauce they drenched it in was amazing, I've never tasted anything like it. I had the foie gras burger and I enjoyed it, but I liked my bfs lobster and shrimp burger more!! The shrimp they used was definitely tiger shrimp. The foie gras was really good too although just a little on the salty side. These four items ran us about $90 which was expected. This place is definitely worth a try, can't wait to try the other GR restaurants next time we visit !",

    "text": "Simple and Sweet  Located in Planet Hollywood, this fine establishment awaits you. What are they known for ? Burgers. GOOD burgers. I tried the hog burger and the forest burger and both were fantastic! I preferred the hog burger simply because it had more flavor. The pork patty was nicely cooked and reminded me of a breakfast sausage. The bacon with the bbq pork added not only texture but a nice smokiness to go with the patty. The pickles and slaw were slightly sour but rounded out the burger nicely. We also accompanied our burgers with truffle fries. If you don't like your fries thick, then i say skip them. Fortunately for me i love thick fries and these were nicely fried and salted. It also came with ketchup and a strong truffle aioli.  The decor is very nice. It has the hell's kitchen vibe with fire running through the glass wall. There are plenty of TV's so you wont miss your sports games. The wait for us was about 45 minutes which gave us enough time to win some money at the slots. From the time you order, it will take an additional 35 minutes to get your food when it's busy (which is always). For burgers, the price is steep (and you're paying for the Gordon Ramsay name) but the burgers are monster sized . Even without fries, i think you will be really full. I encourage you all to try it if you haven't.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if I was going to love Gordon Ramsay Burger because, well, how do you mess up on - or improve upon - the classic burger? Well, I was wrong: the burgers here are absolutely on another level. Each visit here I had the Uber Cheese Burger - 4 different cheeses that, when all melted together, topped this burger perfectly. The mix of sharp, rich, and cheesy flavors along with the gooey melty texture atop a perfectly cooked beef patty was just exquisite. A True treat to the palette.  I have also tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and that definitely had a powerful kick to it, but then again I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods! The Farmhouse Barber was also mouthwatering - you can go wrong when you add a fried egg on top!  I have also tried the Burnt Ends Poutine - this was different, as I've never had poutine before, and thought the combination on the gravy was different - it wasn't bad, but wasn't my number one choice. Then of course are the Parmesan Truffle Fries - an absolute must-have side when you have burgers!   Worth the stop; I just wish it was a shorter walk from the parking garage to the restaurant! I hate having to go through the miracle mile every time, but I guess it's a good way to walk off your meal!",

    "text": "Slightly disappointed by this restaurant. With a great name behind it, you would think it was be delicious.   The saving grace on the menu was definitely the onion rings, the truffle fries, and the curry fries on the appetizer portion of the menu. The onion rings were fluffy while crispy, and had great dipping sauces to them. Same with the fries, it was so much fun to try all the dipping sauces.   For the rest of the menu, it all sounds very interesting with eclectic burgers and hot dogs; however, the flavors don't fully deliver. I tried the Ale Dawg, which was a hot dog with bacon wrapped sausage, cheddar ale sauce, caramelized onions, Fresno chili's, cheddar dusted potato crisps. The hot dog was huge and had a great look, but the taste was pretty bland with nothing more to offer. The potato crisps on it were pretty good. My friends options for burgers were mediocre too.   Overall, fun concept but no flavor. The service was good for a busy restaurant.",

    "text": "Coming to eat at one of GR restaurants has been a dream of mine for some time now. My fiance and I are huge fans of his who love to enjoy his shows together. So for our post engagement photo dinner we decided to treat ourselves!   We ordered a farmhouse burger, onion rings, and an Oreo crepe brulee shake.. WOAH!! I never in my life have tasted such flavor and juices from a burger. I'm not even a huge burger lover but this blew me away! The egg, bacon, and cheese on that burger set that juicy patty flavor off. The onion rings were delicious and so different from what I'm accustomed to. With the Parmesan its an amazingly different take on the classic favorite. But that shake was INCREDIBLE!! From the creamy Oreo to the thick creme brulee top this was so delicious.   Our server Greg was very funny and attentive which is always nice. But it was another employee that really caught my attention, Caleb H. Caleb Henry has AMAZING work ethic! He was cleaning tables around ours non stop and never once stopped smiling, he caught our attention by that alone. Once we stopped him to ask for his name we were blown away that he's even friendlier than expected. Caleb is a perfect example of a hard worker that loves their job and IT SHOWS!! I made sure to stop and tell a manager about him as well.   Overall we had an AMAZING experience at GR burger and can't wait to return again.",

    "text": "We've enjoyed countless meals at Gordon Ramsay Burger, taken friends and family to eat here and always highly recommended this place but unfortunately after our last experience I don't foresee us ever returning. (My original post is under their \"BurGR\" Yelp page)   Superbowl 2019:  We decided to make reservations here for a party of 11. Las Vegas offers a never ending list of \"BIg Game parties\", we could've went anywhere else but what could better than our beloved burger place? We arrived at 2:15pm and were quickly set up in our reserved table. Around 2:45 (before game start) we find out 2 of our friends would not be making it and we immediately asked the waitress if we could reduce our head count to 9total and avoid the charge for the 2 who couldn't join us. (We would've moved and made the 2 seats available of course) The waitress said she would check with her manager and returned to give us the \"good news\" that they would accommodate us and only charge for the 9 people who were present. She even said \"make sure to check the bill that it only shows 9 total headcount\". Awesome!! we all thought, now let's enjoy the drinks, food and game. Well, we all know how the game went so let's fast forward to the end.  We are given the bill, and after reviewing we see that we are being charged for 11 total @ $190/person. So we kindly ask the waiter (our original waitress shift was over 1hr before the game ended) to revise the bill to only show 9 total. A \"manager\" comes over to us and explains that no one in management had approved reducing the headcount. Of course the waitress who had confirmed with us was gone so it was our word against theirs ... guess who won, NO definitely NOT the customer. There was a lot of back and forth and after very condescending rude remarks from the \"manager\" (I'm guessing assistant mgr) our friend felt the need to step in and defend his wife from the jerk mgr who was being very rude (maybe drunk himself) and raising his voice towards 2 female customers. We explained several times that if the waitress had originally said \"no there would be NO accommodation and that we would be charged for 11 total\" that would've been the end of it, No questions asked. But instead both managers (yes there was a 2nd manager who stepped in when the first was removed for almost getting into physical altercation with our friend) were adamant that we the customers were bonkers, no one agreed to any arrangement and the \"shut up, Pay me\" attitude eventually wore us down and drove us out of there with a very BAD taste in our mouth. Sadly to say, we ended up paying for 10 of the 11 seats because god forbid a customer be right. Take that loyal customers!!!   But wait, there's more ...  the following day, my fiance (diamond players card / Caesar's entertainment shareholder) calls the 2nd manager who insisted he spoke with the original waitress and confirmed she never told us of the headcount reduction. My fiance then asks to speak with the waitress direct & luckily she was available and confirmed to my fiance over the phone that she DID in fact tell us we would only be charged for 9 but was advised by her manager to just \"say that\" and still charge us for 11 people in the end (maybe hoping we'd get s***faced and forget?)  The issue here was never the $$ but the principle, no one likes to be called a LIAR.",

We walk through the restraunt and get seated at the bar which was cool to be able to see them prep and line up the burgers.  First our water comes.... with 6 ice cubes. Mind you  Its 110 degrees outside.  The cheeseburgers range $16 to 22 dollars this price does not include fries or anything. We ordered the fries, onion rings and 2 burgers.  The onion rings are greasy, the burgers were actually bland. The meat wasnt seasoned, the bread totally over powers the burger & my fiance literally took the duck bacon off his burger because he said it tasted like a doggy treat.

We came a bit after they opened. Surprisingly, there are already a lot of people seated! The seating weren't as comfortable and really close together. We were seated next to another couple and basically watched them eat their burgers.   The menu offers a bunch of different items such as appetizers, soups, salads, and list of burgers to pick from. We ordered   *Farmhouse Burger 15 dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg - My husband loves fried egg in burgers. This was juicy and really delicious.   *Crown Burger 15 aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb aioli, dried tomatoes - I ordered this as I love arugula and aioli. I cut in half but it was so good that I finished the half in three bites.  True Parmesan Fries 11 - Enough for sharing. I would not order individual fries. We finished about 4/5 of our fries. The aioli sauce that came with it was bomb. Definitely the fries to get if you are dining here.   Overall, the experience was very good. One of the better burgers we've had.",

    "text": "I love Gordon Ramsay, so I just had to eat at one of his restaurants while I was in town! There was a line of people waiting to be seated. NOTE: only parties of 2 or less wait in the line. Parties of 3 or more need to put their name on a list and they will contact you via text when your table is ready.   The wait was estimated to be an hour long. When we were notified that our table was ready, we were about a 7 min walk away (waiting for our drinks lol). We called them to let them know and they held our table for us! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and onion rings. Everything was pretty good -- a bit on the pricey side, but that was already expected. I had some of friends' truffle parmesan fries and they were okay. I don't think they were worth $11, and I preferred the onion rings over the fries.   Service was okay. Our waitress was hard to locate at times when we needed something, but it wasn't anything to get upset about. Would I come back? Yeah, but I would consider other options first. Next time, I'm coming for your steakhouse, Gordon Ramsay! ;)",

I'll make this short and sweet: this place is kind of overrated. $15 to eat a burger (price of fries not included) in front of a giant portrait of Gordon Ramsay. I had the Crown Burger which is just a fancier version of the DGB from Red Robin. Tastes exactly the same. We waited an eternity for our burgers to come out: the guys who were seated much after us got their food at the same time we did. Our fries were cold and stale. Only thing I liked about the meal was the dipping sauce for the fries. I was also pretty impressed with presentation, but presentation can't fix mediocre food.",

We ordered hellfire chicken wings, hell's kitchen burger (most popular one as per our server) and truffle fries. Wings were amazing with lot of flavor, great balance of sweet and spicy and juicy. The burger was ok, juicy meat but lacking flavors and the bun/bread was ok too. I have had better burgers than this. The fries were ok.   Also there was waiting of approx 20min which was not too bad and servers were nice.   Overall I liked it and would wanna go to have wings again and may be try other things on menu when in Vegas but not for hells kitchen burger ;)",

When she returned, she wasn't pleasant at all. Food came over cooked. Ordered medium and got well done.  She checked on us once after 30 mins.  The food was just not the same as it was when it was BurGR. Very saddened by this. Looked forward to coming here again.

I had the stout burger which was cooked medium which I learned from our server is their version of medium rare and that's exactly how it was done. The burger was nicely flavorful but the mushrooms on it were chewy and some of the stems I couldn't bite through. I even had a hard time trying to slice it with a knife. The truffle fries were good, although my portion appeared to have come from the bottom of the bowl where all the little broken pieces settle. The server was nice enough to get a fresh batch for me. For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding and it was very tasty. Not the best one I've ever had, but made for a nice sweet treat. I don't think I'd eat here again.

Have you ever seen that meme where Gordon Ramsay slaps two piece of bread around a persons face and makes them admit they're an idiot sandwich? That's how I felt after I tried two burgers: like an idiot who paid $20 per burger.   We waited for an hour before being seated. The line was frustrating because every time we peeked inside there were available tables that were clean and ready. Not sure what they were waiting for since the cutlery and napkins were already set.  ANYWAYS - we got the burger with goat cheese/arugula and the one with foie gras. Both were (and I hate to say this because I had such high expectations): underwhelming. The burgers were cold and I did not taste the melding nor complimentary nature of ingredients.   The highlight of the dinner was the truffle fries dip. I asked for an extra helping and was pleasantly surprised when there wasn't an extra charge. I used everything (burger, crust, fries) as a vehicle and excuse to enjoy the truffle dip. SO GOD DAMN GOOD that it raised this rating from a 1 to 2*.",

    "text": "I decided to bring my best friend to Gordon Ramsay Burger for her birthday! We always do the high end steak house type of thing but this time I wanted to switch things up. Gordon Ramsay is one of her favorite chefs and she loves burgers! So this place couldn't have been a better decision. I called in advance to try and make a reservation and was informed that they DO NOT accept reservations and it was a first come first serve type of situation. Yikes! Say what? Yeah I was bit nervous about this because being that we were going on a Saturday night I could only imagine how packed they were going to be!   When we first arrived the line looked like people ready to get on a roller coaster at six flags. I just knew the wait was going to be 2hrs! To my surprise I saw a sign that read \"For parties of 3 or more see host\" That worked out for us because we had exactly 3 in our party! Score! Gave the hostess my number at was told we would be seated in about 45 minutes! Not bad at ALL! The Miracle Mile Shops are good to wonder around when you have a wait like this but we didn't even have to wait the full 45 minutes I got a text message saying our table was ready in about 30 minutes. Wining points already!  Once we were seated our hostess came right over and gave us a cool little introduction about the place and explained the menu. I appreciated her acknowledging my best friends birthday and made sure that we were brought something out in celebration for that. The cocktail menu is on an iPad which I don't know why I always think this is so cool! No drinks for us though we had plenty before at Fat Tuesdays and at this point starving was an understatement!   Food:  Beer Battered Onion Rings- Parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip  Truffle Parmesan Fries  2 Farmhouse Burgers- Dublinar cheese, Mangalitsa bacon, fried egg  Backyard Burger- American cheese, butter lettuce, tomato,pickle, onion  Overall everything was fantastic! We really enjoyed ourselves and most important my best friend said that she was so excited to try this place. The service was top notch and the food came out exactly how we wanted. NO complaints just kudos and handclaps for Mr. Ramsay!",

Used one of my faves for baseline, Hopdoddys.  It's bigger but probably not double the price better but it's convenient on the strip.  The burger is good but found the bun to be too commercial.  HD makes their in-house so always have a fresh-soft-buttery bun.    Overall a good burger and worth it with the credit!  PS dig the nachos!",

    "text": "So this week I am in Vegas for 2 days for my daughters roller derby game. My 2nd time in Vegas, my daughters 1st. We arrive at our #Airbnb which is 20 minutes from the strip at 4pm. I've been driving since 10 or 11am and at this point I am #HANGRY. So we start going back and forth about where to eat and not steer away from our #Whole30 ways. All of a sudden it was like a lightbulb went off. Wifey and I were like BUMP THAT!!! Where's Gordon??? \"I want a burger\"!!!  So we head over to the strip get to the restaurant and of course, there's a line from the door well into the casino. However, because we were only a party of 3 we didn't have to wait in that line. We did have a 45 minute wait time. So we walked around for a bit then came back after 30 minutes and ordered drinks at the bar. I look at the drink menu (which is a tablet) the bartender hands me and like a jerk, I start looking at the list of beers. First off, I hardly ever order a beer in my home state. It's a rule for my family, if you're out of town you do not order something you'd ordinarily get at home; if you do you are a jerk!   Anyway, I ordered the Honey Tennesse Jack Daniels peach cocktail for me and wifey and when I say we were so happy with those drinks I ordered 4 more for myself (in my mind). But I needed to eat and I was conflicted because everything sounded so good. Plus I wanted that seafood burger and the Anniversary burger so I got both and a poutine. I ordered it the way chef recommends and so glad I did. So flavorful and perfect portions. My only critique would be the seating booths are slightly too low, I felt kind of awkward at the table. Other than that the staff was great, warm a personable. We enjoyed every bite and will be back everytime we are in Vegas. #BaptisteClan",

I asked for my mine medium and it was perfectly cooked.  My friends both had the forest burger which comes with grilled mushroom and they both loved it.

What I loved is that usually you taste nothing but a mushroom after-taste with poutine but this flavor was much different! More of a freshly cracked black paper taste. Burnt ends were by far the best part. And cocktails? Definitely worth it! I can't forget the Oreo creme brulee milkshake! I have never had anything like that in my life! By far, best tasting food.",

Both were absolutely amazing. Soup was hot, creamy and had perfect texture. I ordered the blue cheese burger and my husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The blue cheese was of really good quality and the meat cooked exactly how I asked. The Hell's Kitchen burger was off the charts fantastic. Don't be intimidated by the heat! It's perfect. Just the right amount of kick and all the flavor! Finally, we had a chocolate shake. There's pudding on top of the shake! Pudding! Enough said!  I was beyond satisfied at Gordon Ramsay's Burger.

I couldn't stop eating it, and I normally don't finish a big meal.. but this burger...I made it a mission to eat it.. I made it a goal! And boy, I was sad once I was officially done with it because I knew it will be forever until I get this burger again.:(  It felt like I woke up from a great dream. If you are unsure on what to get from the menu.. GET THE HELLS KITCHEN BURGER!",

The burgers can run $15 to $22 but  the mixed drinks and desserts are priced below normal for the Strip.  But price doesn't matter if the food is excellent!  In the world of burgers, this place is a real stand-out. The only downside is you will most likely wait on line for about 20-30 minutes and also wait that long for your food.",

They tell you that the burgers take 25 minutes so we ordered the poutine and it was AMAZING. Creamy and rich with the burnt ends, it could almost be a meal itself. My son had the Farmhouse and he loved it. He also had the Creme Brulee shake and all I could think of was the scene from Pulp Fiction where John Travolta asked Uma Thurman about a $5 shake and than said it was pretty good. It's REALLY good. I had the Pork Chop and Applesauce Burger cooked medium and it was super flavorful. My only mistake was ordering a side of fries, not that they weren't good, they were, but I had them w the poutine. I wished our server had suggested something different. Staff was friendly and I noticed that all of them were unusually attractive, so certainly an incentive to wait in line. The only thing missing was the yelling from the kitchen.",

I definitely recommend the sweet potato fries and the truffle parmesan fries; they are perfection, especially when dipped in their coordinated sauces. That being said, the burger was kind of a flop. I had the Forest Burger which had two of my favorite burger toppings, mushroom and bacon (although in the odd forms of forest mushrooms and duck bacon), but the tremor cheese overwhelmed the taste of everything else on the burger. The burger tasted like a meaty block of tremor cheese, with not even a hint of bacon or mushroom to it. Kind of my mistake though, I ordered the burger despite it being topped with an unfamiliar cheese, and paid the price.",

The menu added/removed some items and the restaurant has a more UK theme now. I tried the Crown Burger which was not on the previous BURGR menu, and it came with aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb aioli, and sun dried tomatoes. The meat was cooked perfectly medium, and it was juicy and seasoned well. The mimolette cheese resembled almost a sharp cheddar to me and added a nice savoriness to the burger, but it wasn't overly salty due to the bitterness of the arugula and sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes. The aioli wasn't overpowering and complimented the other flavors of the burger, I'd order it again! Truffle fries are a must when I come here, and the truffle dipping sauce is soo good. It did take a little while for the food to come out but it's worth the wait. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas and it's affordable/not outrageously priced.",

I was surprised by the food here, as my expectations were pretty high for this place given the name, but I was incredibly disappointed. There were 4 in our party and two ordered burgers. One was ordered as medium well, but it was medium (bright pink center throughout) at best. The second was ordered medium and it was closer to medium rare (bright red center).Our server only checked on us once right at the first bite, so we never had a chance to voice our complaint. She was very nice and did a great job otherwise.  The truffle fries were way over cooked.  Check out some of the other burger joints in this area as there are TONS and here you are really only paying for the name.   *Edit: I added a third star to my review as I was contacted by the management team in regards to my review. The individual who reached out has shown genuine concern for my experience and promised follow up will be made with staff to ensure this does not happen in the future.  I personally feel exceptional customer service is essential in this industry, so this was very meaningful to me. Ownership is essential and they seem to want to genuinely provide a great experience to their customers, including recognizing they made a mistake and ensuring they catch any that may occur quickly enough in the future so it can be resolved.",

The burger tastes plain, your chefs & associates looked more confusing than anything as I sat for awhile to wait for our order to get to the table. How is it that from the moment we ordered that it still takes an hour to be actually served? There was exactly three chefs and maybe 3-4 helpers prepping plates and still it took an hour, on top of waiting in line for an hour already. Not worth the two hour wait when burgers shouldn't take this long to make. Service was even worse, our waiter never came by not even ONCE, in that hour to refill our waters, get another beer, asked if we needed anything else or even a fair warning that the kitchen is backed up. NOPE, none of that happen. Then when the food finally came out, she proceeded with an attitude that our burgers took so long, as I also asked for another refill on waters. Anyway, overall horrible experience. Service was horrible. Food was ehh. Hype about what?!?! LOL",

Every once in a while she looked up to engage the customer who would be instantly seated at one of the many available tables.  Once finally seated it was hard to flag down your server.

I forget the name but they were the ones with \"Parma ham\" and an aioli. Will post the name soon.  Tandoori chicken burger - awesome. The texture IS a little drier than I would have liked but it worked really well. I think it's meant to be like this. Definitely not something I could make at home I don't think.  Wouldn't give 5 stars bc the wait honestly was a buzz kill. I would have just liked to hop on the bar and eat there but the line included bar spots too. And no one was taking them regardless.  Plenty of TV's to watch the games that are on.  Order right when you sit down-- take a menu and check it over while waiting. Each burger takes 30 min to make  so be sure to snag a menu in line.  Also didn't like how slow the service was all together. But it was relatively crowded when we were there. I'll keep it at 4 stars.",

During my family's most recent trip to Vegas we finally got try their much anticipated burgers.  Overall, the dinner had some hits and misses. Despite the hustle and bustle, all the servers were all friendly, welcoming, and attentive.  We ordered many of the burgers recommended by the staff (i.e., Hell's Kitchen and Forest) as well as some others we thought just sounded delicious (i.e. Ultimate, Hog, Portobello). My favorites were the Ultimate and Portobella.  Both were bursting with flavor and cook to perfection. I would definitely order these two again. The other burgers left me unsatisfied.  The Forest was overall very bland. The duck bacon was flavorless and chewy and meat was unfortunately overcooked (based on how I wanted the burger cooked).  The Hog just had too much going on so it was difficult to appreciate all the ingredients.  Although the burger was definitely huge and filling! Hell's Kitchen tasted good but was under seasoned.  For sides we ordered the fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were AMAZING. They were seasoned well and had a perfect crispy batter.  Both fries were pretty average.  They were not very crisp or seasoned.I was not a fan of the homemade sauces. I was in need for good ol fashion Heinz Ketchup. Overall, I had a good experience but I was just hoping for more consistency throughout their menu.",

    "text": "horrible. The food is EXTREMELY greasy and buttery, it tasted like I was eating pure butter. There was not much flavor in my burger at all. I eventually just stopped eating it. Secondly, the presentation was so plain. Just the burger on a plate with the logo of the restaurant faded and coming off. Lastly, there was a hair in our truffle mayonnaise. Not coming hear again and don't get why there's so much hype.   Looks like this restaurant needs to be on Kitchen Nightmares",

One of the best burgers I've ever had!  And the price ($15) is reasonable considering the Gordon Ramsay name.  Granted, it was \"a la carte\" meaning just burger and you had to buy the fries separately, I've had burgers & fries this expensive at nothing-special restaurants in NYC like Pig n Whistle, which actually cost $17!  It was totally worth the 1 hr 45 min process to eat.  Over 1 hour standing on line and about 45 min to get our burgers, fries and onion rings.  I was hoping the fries would be thin fries because they were served in the kind of steel cones that other restaurants use for their thin fries.  The fries and onion rings weren't memorable.  I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the long wait time (no reservations) and the mediocre fries and onion rings.",

This place is in no way healthy, but OMG is it delicious. I got a caramel butter pecan shake with my burger and truffle fries. I literally moaned and talked about the shake the whole time I was drinking it. And it was gone by the time our burgers and fries came out. The burger had 3 cheeses on it and was made perfectly. The truffle fries were the best I've ever had... And this may sound odd, but the chairs were so comfortable. It was a nice place to relax for a few after roaming around the strip. And I like the pyrotechnic decor at the entrance. It's a nice touch.",

Service was great!  They were very nice.   1) Tandoori chicken burger - it was a bit dry and the feta is dry too so the tahini sauce could not save it. It was OK.  I would get something else. 2) Lobster-shrimp burger - SOOOO GOOD!  I would definitely get this again.  The pickled vegetables are spicy and tangy and really makes the burger 3) Parmesan fries- they are shaped like chips or wedges rather than thin fries just so you know. Make sure to ask for all their ketchups - chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup and regular as they are all tasty.  The truffle mayo it comes with too is tasty!  Overall great place and our server was really nice. Its a tasty reliable place to eat.",

Before when I was a platinum status total rewards member the service was outstanding. We would get a nice table and usually had a greeting with the manager about our experience. After becoming a Diamond Member, we were seated by the front end and service was far below anything I had experienced while in Vegas. It took forever to get our drinks. Then the server returned and took appetizer orders (one person was not ready to order)... after about 30 minutes our appetizers arrive. the server exclaims, \"I'll be right back!\" We literally waited another 30 minutes, nothing... no refills... we were tired of waiting and had to go to the hostess to request our bill. At the same time, our ahi tuna sliders were nasty. No consistency between them... I was so upset that if I had spoken to a manager I would have probably yelled at them, I was so upset. I paid quickly and left. Maybe someday... I will give them another chance...",

The name has changed from \"BurGR\" to \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\" located at Paris Casino. All the names on Menu has been updated into new names but seems like the ingredients haven't changed.  I had to go back home right away so we decided to choose TOGO, and it was great experience. The girls at the front helped me with new menu and it was fairly fast. (Explained it's almost the same as other older menu) The food took about 30-40min to come out but looking at the Line, I would rather gamble some $ while waiting for food to come out.  Food came out pretty warm and it was awesome burger!!  We will be back again next year~!",

The burger was somewhat dry and needing more seasoning, the truffle fries were too salty, aioli overpowered with mayo and didn't taste much of garlic/other flavors, and the shake was good despite being too sweet (it's a desert shake so I guess that's not too much of a shocker). The service was great-the server checked in with us a few times and accommodated a request to switch out a burger because it was super dry (switched a Hog Burger to a Farmhouse instead). Restaurant was clean. (They recently switched from Burgr to Gordon Ramsay Burger)",

We were lucky to stand in line outside the restaurant for only 10mins, but had to wait half hr for our fries and burgers! They could have atleast given our hungry souls the fries before the burgers arrived. Other than that, the host n service was good. The burgers were awesome, no doubt on that. But paying $60 for burger&fries!...hmm. maybe I'll do it just once.",

    "text": "I don't eat hamburgers but if I went off the reservation it would be a beef burger here at Ramsay' s. The wait is always around 11/2 hours but it's worth it. Attentive service,  excellent food and drink make this a \"must see\" stop if your visiting Vegas. The only negative is it's in the lobby of the Planet Hollywood hotel which is a hotel way past its prime and dirty to boot. If you enjoy watching people of every oriental persuasion who appear underdressed even for a trailer park, then this is your place. Otherwise, put on your blinders and endure the chattel because your most excellent burger is only a relatively short wait away. I always get the Fish and Chips burger, a great nod to Gordon's Great Britain derivation, but the number of creative burgers on the menu is legion. You can even get a Turkey patty in place of beef if so inclined,  which is not on the menu. The restaurant is really a sports bar lounge so be prepared for a noisy meal. The last time I was there the Fish n Chips burger did seem a little under par for Ramsays as little chips were plated and the Fish was kinda greasy but they get a pass since it was Christmas eve.(I doubt it's a trend) All in all if you love timely service and EPIC burgers, you need to put this one on your bucket list.  So, go there. Go there now!",

I passed by the restaurant several times during my last visit to vegas and there always seemed to be a line. Thank goodness we had reservations and was seated within 15 minutes of checking in.   Since I don't eat meat I decided to go for the Portobello mushroom burger which was over $20. I shared onion rings, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries with others. The burger itself wasn't that memorable and the fries were not the best. I think the onion rings were good though.   All in all, service was meh maybe because they were busy. I probably will not return though just because it's vegas and there are so many other restaurants that taste better. =/",

The crispy skin was very thick and looked to be breaded or had some type of coating that made it thick, chewy and rubbery. The chicken is ground up chicken, not a chicken breast.  The sweet potato fries that were all small bottom of the fry basket! They took the chicken sandwich back and brought me a burger. They served the burger cut, with the cut side down so the bun was super soggy from the juice & fat. The server even commented on how it shouldn't look like that. Needless to say I won't be back!!!",

I then requested to have a side of ranch which took 3 reminders to finally get and also never got a refill throughout the whole night I've been here before and spent countless hours and dollars at this establishment but I have yet to be absolutely satisfied with my stay nothing on my table that night was served properly and it's a shame I had to experience this but nobody is perfect even a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant.",

Very fancy Parmesan fries, a must buy. Servers are extremely nice, the menu is pretty good. The highlight was definitely the meat and cheese. The mozarella tasted like heaven and made me regret not getting a double cheese burger. I even got a hat.....I don't know why....",

Literally would have recommended this place to anyone because the food is just delicious! Second time around, today to be more specific, I left completely disappointed. Not disappointed with the food because it was just as delicious as the first time. Disappointed because for some reason the staff kept giving my friends and I unwarranted stares, talking about our group to other staff and looking right at us. Mind you my friends and I are far from being rowdy and obnoxious so I do not see a reason as to why the staff would act this way. We may not dress like the richest people in the world but that does mean it's okay to assume we do not have money. It made the whole second experience very uncomfortable and honestly as much as I love the food I would really think about it long and hard before stepping foot in this establishment again. Food deserves 5 stars.",

Service was decent and friendly, but we did have to ask for water and condiments twice. We ordered a variety of burgers plus some side orders of fries (burgers are a la carte) and we all agreed that they were good, but nothing amazing. It wasn't worth the $24+ price tag. I ordered the Forest Burger which promised duck bacon and seasonal mushrooms and a side of Just Fries.The bun was nice and soft. The meat was cooked perfectly to order, but the it could have had more fat. The \"seasonal\" mushrooms were just criminis and shimejis which can be bought at many grocery stores. I was expecting something more exotic. The duck \"bacon\" was just a crispy piece of duck meat with barely any skin or fat. When you think bacon, you think a nice mix of meat and fat. The burger also had unmentioned goat cheese. I am not a big fan of goat cheese, but it worked with the burger because of the aforementioned lack of fat content.  The \"fries\" are thick cut British chips, not bad, but a little misleading. I can get a better quality and better priced burger back home in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

Shanna happened to help us when we dined here last year and we so so fortunate to have her help us out again this year. She truly makes the experience at your restaurant spectacular. Above and beyond is an understatement. Can't say enough great things!!! Make sure you get the Hells burger and sweet potato fries or the just fries followed by the cranbrulee  Oreo cookie shake- it's the best shake ever!!!  Get an appetizer while u wait such as the wings- absolutely superb!!!  If you are a party of two generally you will wait 20 to be seated and a party of 3 or more is a solid 35 min but definitely worth the wait!! Go and see the hostess and she  will give you a text when your table is ready so you can grab a drink and play slots while u wait rather than wait in a line...  Love this place - can't wait to go back!",

I had a Pepsi and she had a refill on the table before I got down to 1/3 of my existing glass. She checked in regularly to see if we needed anything. If you have the luxury of requesting a server, ask for Wendy.  We ordered onion rings that came with a chipotle catchup and a cheddar ranch. These were not pre-made but were obviously hand dipped and fresh. They were good but a little too greasy and kind of fell apart. Still they were dogone good.  The burgers were the most expensive I've ever had but worth every penny. The meat is ground fresh from chuck, brisket and short rib. Incredibly flavorful and moist but not greasy moist. I had the Farmhouse burger with bacon, cheese and an egg. Absolutely fantastic!! My wife had the ultimate cheeseburger which had three types of cheese and the flavor marries like I would have never imagined. I'm so lucky my wife loves me enough to let me have a couple bites.  If you love hamburgers this place goes to a whole new level. Expensive? Yes. Super busy? Yes, expect to wait. But, it is well worth it.",

We came back at 8:15pm and got seated right away.   If you order the tasting menu, you get to take home an autographed photo of the one and only Gordon Ramsay. However, we decided to go with the Roasted Beef Wellington, Lobster Wellington, and a side of Mac & Cheese. You get a complimentary plate of 4 different types of bread while you wait for your meal (you can even ask for a second serving).  Even though I had the 6 oz Wellington, the pastry made it very filling. The beef was really soft. The lobster was also good, but not worth the price. The Mac & Cheese was decent, but nothing special.  Btw, there is no complimentary dessert on your birthday. Compared to other three- and four-dollar sign restaurants, they are lacking in this area. The most you would get is a \"happy birthday\" from the wait staff.",

My friend and I both ordered a yummy tequila cocktail which was quite strong for me! We also both ordered the Forest Burger and an order of just fries. They both came out pretty quickly, and the burger was amazing! The mushrooms in it was the perfect compliment. The fries are steak fries, which aren't my favorite, but they give you a chipotle and curry ketchup. I don't like ketchup, but the curry one is nice. I also asked for a truffle aioli which was yummmmmmmmmy! Perfect to add to the burger too.  For the price, this place can't get any better! A must try for some good food!",

I would suggest getting your burger cooked medium to medium rare to ensure the freshly ground beef stays moist. It would be criminal to dry this baby out.  Our server, Adam, was playfully helpful and attentive. He patiently helped me wade through the extensive beer options. The loud and boisterous crowd added to the fun experience. Although the line can look daunting, it moves along rather quickly, so don't let it scare you off. The wait is well worth it.",

Since we weren't too hungry we decided to share the blue burger, chips with curry sauce, and a brown butter caramel pecan shake. Our server came by pretty quickly to ask us if we wanted to order any drinks (they're all listed on an ipad) but we declined seeing as how we already packed in quite a few drinks by that time. From there the service went a bit downhill, our server wasn't very friendly and also got our order wrong (order wasn't written down, just remembered). We ended up with the correct burger and drink but truffle parmesan fries instead - we decided not to send this back since it looked pretty good and the price difference is pretty small anyway. One thing to note, the food took a very long time to come out; we finished pretty much the entire shake before the fries came out.   As for taste, the blue burger is a solid if you like blue cheese, relatively simple but done well. I will say that I enjoyed my forest burger from our last visit a bit more. We loved the fries though, especially the truffle sauce which was extremely decadent. The shake was superb and I like how there were caramel pecans right on top - would definitely recommend trying out their shakes!!   We essentially didn't see our server for the rest of our meal and had to wait quite a while to get the check.   With everything said, I still like Burger- the food is great & well priced, plus the poor service seemed to be a relatively isolated incident. The tables in other sections near us seemed to have pretty attentive servers & our server from our last visit was also extremely friendly and attentive. Overall I'd still recommend stopping by if you're staying at Planet Hollywood or just craving a burger!",

The burgers take 30 minutes to cook. But wow it's worth the wait. My burger was so juicy and tasteful.  I also ordered the wings here while we waited for the entree. Wow the wings were better than I expected.   The service was great.  Customer service was on point. The location does get packed, there was a line of people in front of us and still a long line after I left.   I even watched the employees clean the tables and I was amazed.   This is truly a remarkable restaurant that I can definitely see myself coming back to.   Thank you for your excellent service.  You have to try it, you won't be disappointed.",

You are greeting by friendly host who take you to your table. The kitchen is open so you can see all your chefs/cooks making everyone's food and drinks. I love open kitchens to the dining rooms. It's more comforting to me at least. The waiters/waitresses and servers are on point here. They are fast and so friendly. I like how they come around to check how everything is and if anything else is needed. The burgers roughly take 20-25 minutes so if you are HANGRY, get an appetizer lol. The burgers are worth the wait because they are made fresh to order. We got the hellfire wings and kettle nachos as an appetizer and man.. it was deliciousness all over your mouth! The wings do get blue cheese crumbles on there so if you're not a fan, let them know to take it out. For me, I loved it. The nachos are interesting and absolutely flavorful. Never thought of having kettle chips instead of tortilla chips. You can definitely taste the freshness! For my burger of choice, I did get their spring Special with had portobello mushrooms, pickled shallots, arugula, cheese and a cheese spread type condiment. OH! I got the Impossible Burger patty with it cooked medium and OH MY TASTEBUDS WERE HAPPY!! Like really, I had to really ask myself if this was really beef. They cook their burgers perfectly. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I mean, come on! Gordon Ramsay here.. I'm sure he'll check his people working if they don't do it right. There is a Scottish Ale on the menu which is suppose to be Gordon's favorite beer.. PLEASE TRY IT!! It's really good. I'm an IPA girl but if it's his favorite, why not try it right? If you're unsatisfied with your burgers here, drink a little more at the casino or a bar then come back hahaha! Jk! (Some of you will get it later) Anyways, happy eating my fellow Yelpers! Cheers!",

The winner, Christina Wilson, is the executive chef here!  I was mind blown on how juicy the burgers were.  I always order the Farmhouse burger and the addition to the fried egg is exquisite.  I love Truffle fries, but I was disappointed the way it was made here. They were cut in wedges so you don't get the crisp crunch and there wasn't enough truffle!  Still a fan of fries though. Fries before guys? For appetizers, we ordered the Pork Belly buns and I was amazed at how soft the buns were. Usually, some places overcook the buns so it ends up dried out.  I'm not sure if they're still serving that, but it's definitely a must have there.  If you're in Vegas, this is your one stop!",

He did not expect much since this was Vegas, but he said he was surprised by the quality of the food. Anyhow, that is honestly, why I gave these guys a go.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium. First way to kill a burger, at least for me, is to over-cook the thing. I ordered the Farmhouse Burger, which I thought could have had a bit more salt, but the bacon and egg added good flavor. So overall, I was very happy.   Truffle fries were on-point as well, perfectly fried and served with two dipping sauces.   Service was average. We waited in line at 1045am for it to open at 11am. We got our seats and our orders were taken quickly. But, as for refills, I ran out of wine half way through my burger only to be checked on right before I asked for the bill.   Overall, not my favorite burger in the world, but definitely one that I would go back for.",

The meat is seasoned well and the roasted jalapeno adds so much flavor!  Service was great for as busy as this place was (we had about a 15 minute wait at 2 in the afternoon).  Come early if you are too hungry to wait!  Our only issue was that the fries were not very good.  When a restaurant can execute a burger so well, it always makes me wonder how they can mess up french fries?? They were not crispy from the moment they hit the table.  We did enjoy the two varieties of ketchup that they were served with.  We would definitely return in the future.",

Because I hadn't brushed up on my 50 types of cheese I ended up ordering one that had what tasted like a goat cheese on it. Really disappointing since I am not into it at all. I would have asked our waitress what some of the items were but to be honest she seemed less than thrilled to be there and did not make me feel comfortable enough to ask her to explain the items. Not to mention we had to keep asking for our drinks to be refilled, and flag her down to get our bill after we sat there not eating for a good 10-15 minutes. Drink refilling is admittedly one of my nerves because that is serving/waiting 101. I know there are other better waitresses there as one next to us seemed really helpful and eager to assist her table.   We came without a reservation and waited maybe 5 minutes, not bad at all.   This is a wonderful place for someone who is more cultured in their cheeses, odd vegetables, and duck bacon... my boyfriend liked it, me not so much.   Got points for 1. Convenience to the strip 2. Fairly priced for a gourmet burger 3. Awesome truffle fries.",

    "text": "I'm (pretty much) obsessed with Gordon Ramsay so I was ecstatic to be in Vegas with a chance to dine at one of his restaurants. Steak was out of price range (poverty college student) so burgers it was.   Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and truffle fries ($11) to share. The burger was delicious, with a nice kick of heat. Perfectly cooked. The truffle fries were okay - the parmesan was a little overpowering and seemed to absorb much of the truffle oil.   The place is located in Planet Hollywood. It's got a very modern posh look. We came at 11:30am on a Tuesday and had no wait for food...unfortunately after ordering, our food took at least 30 minutes to come out! Luckily I was in good company so there was plenty to talk about but it really was a long time for burgers and fries. Service was just okay, as the server only came by once early on in our wait. The server was knowledgeable about the menu but really didn't display much interest in us after we ordered. The place also doesn't take reservations, so  it can get crowded at peak hours.  Bottom line: It's as tasty as you'd expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. A little pricey but it's Vegas and it does have the Ramsay name. Prepare for a length wait for the food, sadly.  Anecdote: The table of four next to us also had a long wait for their food, so much so that the manager came out to talk to them. They waited for over 25 minutes, which apparently is the policy there. We definitely waited just as long, but no manager came to talk to us - probably because we are potatoes. Sad.",

We were greeted immediately with a smile when we walked in and were seated right away after walking in around 20 minutes after the restaurant opened.  A wall of flames greets guests as they enter the restaurant and the restaurant has a good mix of decor that might interest Gordon Ramsay fans in addition to sports bar appeal.  The onion rings are bomb!  Delicate shavings of cheese topped a large cone of crispy, beer-battered onion rings and the  ranch dressing made the each bite melt into my mouth. My brother and I agreed, these were the star of our lunch. My tandoori chicken burger was good, cooked perfectly with a fresh bun and my tangerine cocktail was so juicy, I wanted more, a great balance between sweetness and alcohol content. The tables have a subtle British theme from the glossy menus with Gordon Ramsay flanked by the British flag to the blue place settings with red cloth napkins, adding a nice touch to the table. One suggestion I'd have is to include plain fries with burgers to provide a more complete meal; it'd allow guests to still choose from their tasty-looking appetizer menu if they wish but would be a more traditional way to enjoy a burger without paying extra. We had a great experience, our waitress was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  A fun lunch and an affordable option in Vegas!",

We waited for 2 1/2 hours for them to tell us that we were not \"Diamond Club\" members (while pointing her manicured nail at the Diamond Club sign) and therefore we weren't guaranteed seating at the time we were promised. The hostess was rude to my husband and was rude to me when all we were asking was if we could get seated. She said that \"her friend took our name down\" so she was not aware of our situation and couldn't help us.  If they were not able to take our party, then they shouldn't have taken our name down. The hostess said twice that our table was ready and they were just waiting on the party to get up-so what happened????? I'm never EVER going to eat at one of Gordon's restaurants if this is how people are treated by staff.",

I especially love the huge photo of him in the middle of the restaurant with his arms crossed, staring at all of his customers as if to say \"Yeah, you know that burger is delicious\"   My favorite here is actually the truffle fries. So so so good. Probably the best truffle fries ever. I have only had truffle fries as good as these in LA at a hot dog joint called Wurstkuchen.   I have ordered the Mushroom Burger here and it was ah-maaazzziiinnggg. The last time I came, I ordered the Ahi Sliders instead and pretty much doubled over, with how delicious it was. I was also a bit drunk too. My boyfriend ordered the burger with the jalapenos and the avocado in it ( can't remember what it was called) and I had a bite of it, we both loved it and didn't want to put it down.   We made some friends in the line waiting for a table and the staff was so accommodating and let us move our table to sit with our new friends.   It was also my birthday and they brought over free dessert, which was so sweet! Delicious. I don't really remember what kind of dessert it was considering how hammered I was, all I remember was that it was yummy.",

I loved that they put our name down in the beginning and texted us when our table was ready. So in the meantime we shopped around! Now about the food. Delicious. I was honestly not even that hungry because we had a somewhat late breakfast, but I definitely did not want to miss out, so went ahead and ate anyway. We started off with 3 kinds of fries - sweet potato fries, the just fries, and the truffle parmesan fries. The parmesan fries were hands down the best! And the sauces that came with were so good. Next came our burger. Our entire group was basically divided in half between the Backyard burger and the Hells Kitchen burger. The latter sounded more appealing to me, so I went with that. And It. Was. Good. So Good. We are definitely going back!!",

We also ordered the garlic fries and poutine.   The Hells Kitchen Burger was AMAZING! Cooked to a perfect medium and full of flavor! My bf's Forest Burger was really good too, but I still prefer the Hells Kitchen Burger. The fries and poutine were also very good. The burgers were a good size. With the fries, we were too full to finish everything and took half the burgers and fries to go.   I would definitely return here for a casual lunch on my next Vegas trip!",

I get it's an appetizers but, the server could have realized that was my gf main course. when the burger comes they bring another plate of ahi sliders. I think \"oh cool they realized what they did and are giving us another order of sliders\" the server realized they already brought them and decided to take them back. I asked if she could just leave them with us since they are already made. she said no. I guess they are selling to let them sit until someone else orders them. 1 stars since the actual burger I got was great.   now the worst of all things. the 8 dollar fries \" just fries\" they were the most stale fries I've ever paid for. they were cold and hard to bite.

Let me start by saying that the staff is always wonderful at every Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been to (Street Pizza, Heddon Street, Gordon Ramsay Steak, and Gordon Ramsay Burgers but NOT Bread Street Kitchen). There was nothing different here. Excellent people. This is, however, his worst restaurant I've been to. By far. The burgers are actually fine, but for nearly $20 for just the burger, not at all what I expected. The French fries with truffle oil and Parmesan - completely overbearing. I could only eat 5 of them. Between me and my friend, we ate an appetizer, a burger and fries, and had one drink per person. $102. Absolutely not. Will most likely never go back.",

The lines can get long, but if you put your name down, they'll text you when your table is almost ready :) I came on a Sunday night around 7:30pm and had to wait for about 45 minutes for a party of 3.   I got the:  -Farmhouse burger  -Hells kitchen burger  -Hells kitchen chicken wings   The farmhouse burger was soooo yummy. It wasn't as dynamic as the Hell's Kitchen burger, but it was simple yet delicious. There was an egg in it, which went perfectly with the bacon and meat. The egg was made perfectly... the runny yolk actually squirted out when I tried to cut the burger.   The Hell's Kitchen burger had spicy jalapeno aoli and really just so much going on. It was delicious!!   I actually didn't like the chicken wings that much. It was pretty juicy, but I'm not a huge fan of tangy flavors so it wasn't my favorite.   The restaurant's front has a huge fire lining the wall and a 'Gordon Ramsay Burgr' sign- super cool! Gordon Ramsay's picture was everywhere hahahah  who is that again?? Some decent chef, right?! ;)",

It was melty, and tangy and loaded with delicious cheesy goodness. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. It really needed nothing else and hit the spot. The perfect accompaniment was an order of their crispy Truffle Fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Because no burger is complete without exquisite fries, am I right?

Once seated, our server got our drinks and an appetizer order. She was very pleasant and explained the different burgers in detail for whatever questions we had.   The burger was good, but not great.

The burger I ordered was cooked exactly how I wanted it but it has almost no flavor. The truffle fries tasted flavorful but all of the fries that I had were small over cooked pieces. My guest ordered the farmhouse burger and they forgot the duck bacon. When we notified our server Brittany and she said, \"oh...I'll get you a side.\" There was no apology, she didn't offer to remake the food, which is a standard practice in restaurant, and she just set it on the table and said, \"here you go.\" Again no apology or anything. Throughout our entire dining experience Brittany did not check up on us, we were waiting and looking around trying to flag her down to little avail. I had high expectations for a restaurant that is under Gordon Ramsay's name but damn...go save your money and eat at In & Out down the street. I guarantee you will be more satisfied there with the food and service.",

My friend and I each got a different burger. I got the bleu cheese burger, she got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Get hers. The Hell's Kitchen burger was so freaking delicious!!! Mine was great, but I really can't get over how good hers was!  The burgers are so juicy. We both ordered ours medium well, hers actually came out over cooked, well done, and was still juicy. We later learned that if you tell them that, they'll get you a new burger within minutes. Our server seemed pretty bummed that we didn't tell her sooner. So please note that. They really care that you enjoy your food.   I also enjoyed that you can keep the menu as a souvenir. I initially thought it was a little cheap for a Ramsay establishment to have laminated paper menus, until she said that, then it all made sense.   If you're hungry, I'd go another day. It takes around 20 minutes for the burgers to come. And they're pretty hearty, so I'm not sure if I'd load up on appetizers. You know what you can eat better than I.   Also, I must stress to get the truffle fries!! It comes with their house ketchup AND a truffle aioli. We actually added the aioli to our burgers and it took them up a million notches! Do it. You won't be sorry!!! This is coming from someone who dislikes mayonnaise, it's so good!!! And you can literally see chunks of truffle inside. Totally worth it.    I will point out that burgers and fries are separate. Entries don't come with sides, but the burgers are so good they really can stand alone! I'll be back the next time I visit to try another sandwich. I know it'll be worth every penny!!",

Besides there are a million places to get a burger here.   Got to this place, solo, to try and get seat at the counter.  Hostess basically indicated I need to wait in line and it's a 30 min wait.  I thought Ok, and trucked to back of the line, thinking I'm the only or one of few soloists. Waited 15 min, moved up, as people removed themselves from the line.  I thought this is odd. I clearly see people leaving and tables are available.  I went back to hostess stand for an explanation. I noticed a lot of empty spots at the counter and quite a few empty tables.  I inquired as to why this is the case.  Answer: \"we can only seat people every 7 min\".  I did the math.  What kind of crap is this!  I promptly removed myself from this idiotic line and bid adeu.  Get it together Gordon! This place has your name and it's turned into a \"shitshow\".",

Although there was already a line, it wasn't too long and we were quickly seated in about 10-15 minutes.  The atmosphere is casual but classy and the waiters and waitresses are wonderful. Since this is called the Gordon Ramsey Burger, we both got burgers and truffle/parmesan fries.  The forest burger is a beef patty topped with tremor cheese, seasonal forest mushrooms, and duck bacon. It was sinfully savory and the buns are crispy and buttery without being overly heavy. The patty was cooked to perfection (caramelized edges with a hint of pink on the inside) and the goat cheese gives an unexpected tang to tickle the taste buds in a delightful way. The mushroom lend the burger an overall mellow earthy tone. Lastly, the duck bacon complements the tangy cheese well with its saltiness. However, I would have preferred the bacon to be thicker since this slice was too thin to bring out the meaty and fattiness of duck meat.  The tomato sauce and truffles aioli sauce for the parmesan fries are really good! The tomato sauce tastes like Italian sweet gravy and the truffles aioli is creamy, earthy, and savory. However, I prefer my fries to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries I received were dry on the inside and out.  The service was very good, but the burger could have been hotter when it arrived. When we received the burger, it was lukewarm which means that it was sitting out for a while before being brought to our table.  Overall, good meal and very good service. Gordon Ramsey Burger did not disappoint!",

We both finished our burgers and had still not been checked up on.  FINALLY we got someone's attention and told them the situation. We told them we didn't even want the fries anymore because we were full off eating the burger (which at this point we had finished 10 or 15 minutes ago). The manager came over and offered us the milkshakes for free. We took it, they were good, and free which is nice. However the waitresses were not taking their job seriously and one girl who didn't look like she worked there sat at a bar and the the staff would just sit and talk to her not doing their job. It was embarrassing for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant...",

Andre ruined our whole experience there at Burger. He was arrogant, and cocky. He seemed like he didn't want to be working, and spoilt the energy/vibe of the night. When he first came to take our order, he straight up told us that there at Gordon Ramsey's burger, the food is ALWAYS late and that we would have to wait for a period of time, so we shouldn't get frustrated.. who does that??? He was just really frustrating. On the other hand of the experience, the food was great.i had the forest burger,  and it was quite delicious. I would definitely give the restaurant a try!

I was in a group of 7 people and they told us it would be an hour wait which was fine since we were on the casino already so we just gambled until we were notified through text message that our table was ready. We arrived and were told they were clearing off our table, okay cool but it literally took them 15 minutes to clear a table off which I felt like was a little bit long to wait after you told us our table was ready. Anyways, the food was great! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger because it had jalapenos which i thought would be spicy but it really wasn't but good none the less. Our table also ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle Parmesan fries. Both amazing!! The swear potato fries were just so damn good! Can't really figure out way but they were not your ordinary fries! And you can't go wrong with truffle! Those fries were amazing as well! Our experience was overall great! I'm docking a star because of the wait but everything else was top notch!",

They have a weekly special that changes but I didn't try because I wanted a beef burger and it was pork. For my first time in Vegas this was a must have on my list and it didn't disappoint. I had the farm house. House cured bacon, egg, and dublinar cheese. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town. We also tried the truffle fries were excellent as well and big enough to share between 3.

They tell you to come back in 30 minutes so you don't have to stand in line and they were right on the time, called us up when our time was up and seated us right away.",

Expect to stand for at least 30 minutes in line outside the restaurant before getting a table, followed by another half hour to receive your food. Because the quality of the burger is not much higher than that of Planet Hollywood's sports bar burgers, I do not believe it is worth the wait. The inside atmosphere was excellent, and the staff seemed to have their operations under control for the most part. If you're able to go at a time when it's not crowded, then it might be worth it; otherwise, I'd sit this one out. Speed up!",

    "text": "Debated on giving this 3 or 4 stars because it is Vegas so some expectations have to be lowered because it is a busy place where higher prices are the norm. My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay and we always watch his shows so we knew we had to check out this place! We went around dinner so obviously we knew it'd be a long wait. It was a 90 minute wait and I was totally willing to stand in line but the hostess took our number and told us we could walk around the hotel/casino and they'd text us when a table was ready. I looove that! We ended up going to a cool bar while we waited and then getting a text to come back, so convenient! We were seated immediately and ordered our burgers. They let us know they take a longer time because they hand make them so we were expecting a longer wait than normal but it was sooo long! Maybe it was because we were hungry but it felt about 3x as long as you'd normally wait at a steakhouse. When we got the food it was absolutely delicious!! I got the UK Burger and could only finish half of it because it was so filling and tasty! Still craving it!  I didn't care for the cocktail much but that could have just been my own tastes. It took forever to get our server's attention to ask for the bill, and then for them to finally come back with the bill. When we finally got them to take our card it took a while for them to bring it back again! This was frustrating because the entire process of waiting for food etc had already taken so long, I thought the checkout process would at least have been swifter. When they finally brought the receipts to sign I was excited-- i thought \"write a tip, sign, then finally LEAVVVE!! YES!\" But nooo... turns out the server charged BOTH bills (we had two groups) on my ONE credit card even though we had given them two cards and explained. Had to wait yet again for them to correct this and I'm still not sure if it was corrected since it was so busy and couldn't hear what was going on much. So the service was definitely not what I expected but the food was good. I think if you go when it's not so busy you would have a 5 star experience but not at prime time.",

I am sure there will always be a wait to eat here because of how amazing the burgers are. This was my first time and we waited about 20 minutes to get seated which wasn't too bad. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super attentive and friendly. Greeted us immediately with drinks and gave his recommendations and what the best items on the menu are. We went with what he recommended which was the famous Hell's Kitchen Burger. It took a while for the burger to come out, which he warned us about, so we also ordered the truffle fries to snack on while we waited. The fries were okay, but I may be bias because I am a thin cut fry person and their fries are thick wedge fries. They were good, but would have been AMAZING if they were thin cut. All that matters is the main course, which was out of this world!! It was on the spicy side, but my goodness! The bun was absolutely perfect and the burger literally melts in your mouth. MUST GO TO BURGER JOINT BEFORE LEAVING VEGAS!! YUM!! Pricing wasn't too bad either, well worth it! I wish I had room for dessert!",

I asked why and she said that they seat in groups every 6 minutes (the restaurant was empty) because they cook the burgers every 6 minutes.  There was 9-10 wait staff standing around but a line of customers waiting to get seated.  So after we ordered we watched how they handled the food and it was no different then any restaurant.  However the wait staff continued to stand around and not provide service.  All the while with the restaurant manager watching all this go on.  We were then hoping for great food.  Unfortunately, the food was not that good.  The fries were less than average and the hamburgers the same.  One of the two burgers we ordered was not cooked as ordered and we had to ask our waiter 2 times for condiments we had asked for when ordering.  And, on top of all this for what was a very simple order took 40 minutes from sitting down until our food arrived.  Don't bother coming to this place, try another burger joint in Vegas, there are many!",

The fries were thicker spears and were not crisp on the outside and the \"truffles\" and cheese seemed to be an afterthought. I could have gone to Five Guys and paid a 1/3 of the price and had a delicious burger and fries for takeout. Gordon would be screaming in the kitchen if he knew or cared.

The Hell's kitchen burger jalapeno was perfectly seeded to give it some heat without it being overwhelming. The avocado was fresh and gave a great texture. Overall delicious.The blue cheese burger has a fig jam, this combination makes the burger. Blue cheese is a very salty cheese, delicious but salty; the sweet from the jam mixed with the salt of the blue cheese was heaven. I typically like thin burger patties as the heavy meat flavor can throw off the flavor balance, this was not the case, they are a thicker patty but the flavors are spot on and they were cooked perfectly. The one thing we didn't like is the truffle fries. The flavor was ok (super salty) but even the uncovered ones were lackluster; tasted frozen, not sure if they were. I came for the burger not the fries so I understand why there is a line out the door to this place. Next time I go to Vegas I will be coming back to this restaurant.",

We got there around 5 and there was a bit of a line, but we were seated within 30 minutes. We ordered the nachos, Hell's Kitchen burgers, and truffle fries.   Within ten minutes we were greeted by a special little guest--a baby cockroach came out to play right by our feet! We were pretty surprised that, what with Gordon Ramsay's habit of battering restaurant owners for their unwelcome pests, he had some in his own restaurant. At least it was only a baby and not that grotesque, but it was still pretty freaky to see at a place where you're about to eat. We told a passing waiter and were moved a couple tables down by the manager, although I'm not sure they ultimately did anything about the cockroach.  On to the food--it was all unimpressive. Everything seemed to be made of good quality ingredients, but lacked flavor overall. The burger seemed to have a good bun, and the meat appeared juicy, but again, no flavor. The nachos were fairly good. The truffle fries were a let-down.   It was just a very \"meh\" meal. There are many, many better places to get a burger on the Strip.",

I've been hearing loads of people wait in line to dine here so I figured I'd try it.  We got there before it opened and there was ALREADY a line. We were sat not too long after they opened. We ordered truffle fries to share and honestly the highlight of the entire meal for me was the dipping sauces... Cheddar ranch? Hell yes! That sauce changed me. As for burgers, I got the Farmhouse Burger. It was just alright. I gave up halfway and just ate everything but the bread. My friend got this nice apple pie cocktail situation and that was very good.  Would I come back? No. Do I recommend it? No.",

About one order for every 2 people.   Everything we have had here has been beyond belief amazing flavors.   Our favorite burger is the Crown burger and we love the truffle parmesan fries.   The sauces are amazing too from the homemade aiolies to the handmade spicy catsup.   In addition to great food the service had always been superb.

For a side dish, we had the sweet potato fries that comes with honey jalapeno Mayo and more vanilla powdered sugar on the side.    Great tasting burger!!  It was quite enjoyable.  I just wish there was a more uniform spiciness to it.  I had three bites where I felt the heat but aside from those bites, it was just not spicy.  I think it would be better distributed if a spicy spread was used.  Also, I usually like some lettuce or cucumber to give a different texture but I know the extra water content can dilute the taste.  If you are gonna call it hells' kitchen, I expect more than 3 fleeting moments of feeling like I'm sitting in a sauna.  I don't need to be crying but up the current level.  The fries are good.  The honey jalapeno Mayo isn't spicy but I don't expect my fries to be spicy which is why I can forgive that here but not the burger.  The fries are plenty sweet by themselves so we didn't even touch the powdered sugar.  My wife got the Wellington burger, medium-rare.  The burger is very tasty. The party that stands out of that croissant.  It's refreshing and different.  If they are still serving it, try it.",

The wait was about 35 minutes on a Saturday night, and we were totally okay with that.   Noise level was a bit high, but it was a happy, fast-moving place. Lots of TVs up with sports on. Wait staff in their uniforms looked a bit like English football players for some reason. Cute. All nice people.   I had the Forest Burger. It was FABULOUS, filled with greens, mushrooms, and duck bacon. I ordered it medium rare; it was juicy and just perfect. We ordered a cone of truffle fries which were super fresh and yummy. I can't stop thinking of them.",

    "text": "Alright so first and foremost, shout out to our server, she nailed it!!   Alright so being a big burgee fan this was one of the most important places for me to eat. Watching Gordon on TV is pretty awesome as we all know so the big question has always been upon me, \"how good of a burger does Gordon do?\"       As the girlfriend and I walked up to the restaurant, we could not help but take in a deep breath and smell the astounding scent of the food on the other side of the hosts booth.    As we sit down, we sink into an really comfortable chair that just invites you to be quiet and take it all in (a lil star struck to try out the food). Looking at the menu my eyes instantly went for the ultimate cheese burger. Basic but always a good safe choice.    Ordered the burger with nothing extra on it AT ALL!! no mustard, no ketchup, no mayo, no tomato, no lettuce, just a naked cheeseburger . Pretty bad choice to do at most places eh? So should be same as this place right? WRONG!!!!!!!!      I fucked up my order and got it well done instead of medium (need to go back and do it properly, sorry Gordon, truly sorry). Still truly one of the best burgers of my god damn life!!! On bested by one other and naturally its Gordon's pub and grill where I did go with it medium (holy god damn!), story for later.     The burger bun can be pocked and it dimples. Pull your finger away and the bun pops right back to perfect shape and texture. Lean in for a smell and I smell cheeses that I have never fucked with before, okay now I am getting excited. Take the first bite of my burger and FUCK ME!!! A bun that starts to melt away in your mouth well the burger slowly followed (again, I fucked up ordering a well done and it was still epic).    The taste that comes from the first bite being mashed together for me was multiple levels of cheese that can be tastes separately and all together maybe that's just me? Or maybe it's the cheeses I don't think I have ever thought of or had on a burger before. Again, no condiments or added veggies, just straight burger bun and cheese.      Any ways enough rambling. Gordon Ramsay's burger. Has to be one of, if not the tastiest burgers to treat yourself to well enjoying an already epic time. Why not make an epic time more epic eh?      Oh! Last comment. Get the onion rings. You will never be able to get onion rings any where else again and be as satisfied. The onion rings they..... I'm not going to expose all the fun. But trust, even if not a burger fan, stop in for the rings     Respect Gordon, your the bees knees.",

    "text": "This review is 2 stars because we made the mistake of assuming that this place would be exceptional. When you walk up to the restaurant there is a line, for burgers.. wow awesome. There are flames. The ambiance was great. Its a perfect fit for Vegas. After waiting a while we were seated. A bit cramped, but I get it. I ordered the farm house burger with truffle parm fries. I ordered the burger medium rare, this burger also comes with a fried egg. As a working executive chef I know this burger is truly a testament to what's going on in there kitchen because they are required to do two semingly  simple things that so many have trouble with on a hot  line. 1) cook a burger to temp 2) cook an egg correctly. I chose this burger because I was really looking forward to crispy mangalista bacon and I adore Dubliner cheese on a burger. They brought the burger to the table. I will get to the fries in a minute. The burger was way overcooked! It wasn't even close. It was medium well at best. And the fried egg was lacking the beautiful yolk explosion that I was hoping for in my first bite. The Dubliner cheese was devine as expected and I was so disappointed with the bacon. Mangalista bacon is really some of the best dry cured bacon that you can aquire. It's signiture buttery smokey flavor was just lost in the flavor of the cheese and egg. It was however cooked correctly. I liked the bun.  It's the classic social dining conundrum; do I send back my food to leave my wife aquardly eating alone or do I just deal with being unsatisfied with my meal for the sake of the date.I sent my burger back.  being that this is  nearly a $20 burger it seemed fair. The manager did right by remaking me a new burger after me showing them the temp and the egg. As expected my wife was nearly finished with her meal when they brought me another burger. It was cooked correctly the second time. I admittedly rushed through it so my wife wouldn't get bored with me. Let's talk about the fries. They were just ok. I don't know for sure but it seemed they used truffle oil as the were a bit saturated. Truffle salt would have been far better as it would have kept the fries lighter. Going back to the burger the flavors were good but it really lacked acidity which you really need with all the fat from the burger, the bacon and the egg. I felt like I had eaten a brick after my meal. I take some responsibility for that as I chose what food I ordered, but dang it was heavy. I will close this review by saying that I think it was somewhat obvious that my wife and I were not happy with our experience. The right thing to do would have been to take my burger off the bill, they didn't. Also when you send out a new burger, send hot fries too, by the time I got my new food my old fries were toast. As always I will leave the door for dialogue open. Please feel free to reach out to me with questions. I will and do update these reviews,if you do choose to have a conversation with me about my experience I will be fair to your establishment and document that. Thanks",

    "text": "Mr Ramsay if you really care about your restaurant you need to hire new restaurant manager. I visited your burger place because my teenager son likes your tv show. I cannot believe my service here .  1) Waiter gave me my coke I asked for a straw , he replied straw is for kids and for certain people only ? I saw other tables have got it they are white people! So your restaurant does not allow Asian to have straw?  2) Bus boy came in asked me if I want water instead of soda because their soda machine is broken down so the drink are all flat. My waiter never mentioned to me. I said ok , please return my drink .  3) All my neighbor tables came in later than me got their burger. I was seated at 11:05 am and I got my burger at 11:50 am. My waiter replied me my son order pork is going to be longer. 45 mins for a burger to be done , seriously ?  4) I asked for my bill, waiter did not take away the soda charge until I told him to. I still paid him $8 on my $50 burger meal because I know waiter live by tips.   I am a very reasonable person, I have never expect a 5 star service from a burger place but come on , Mr Ramsey your people is going to destroy your goodwill.   Last but not the least, I really cannot believe I got racist demanding a straw.",

The review would be more of a 3.5/5 if Yelp allowed half stars.  With a minor change to the name and a refreshed menu, we had a much more enjoyable experience than last time. We were at Planet Hollywood for a concert and were hungry after so gave it a shot.   I had the Stout Burger which shared the flavor profile of a French Onion soup. Everything was seasoned beautifully and cooked well, which was a far cry from my last experience here. The fries weren't the best, but when the burger was this tasty it hardly mattered. Decent service too!",

Both types of fries were great.   I can't wait to go back to try the other burgers: Fish & crisps burger and the Lobster & shrimp burger. The Creme brulee shake looked bomb as well. I will definitely try that next time.",

The restaurant looks really nice and makes you want to eat! We ordered the stout burger and the farmhouse burger with a side of sweet potato fries and just fries. The food took a very long time to come out ( 50mins) which was a little disappointing. Finally everything came out and looked really good. Unfortunately although there was good flavors, both burgers were dry and overcooked and the fries were stale (did not come from a fresh batch). We ate regardless because we were starving by the time everything came out. We were left feeling disappointed. Considering how high the bill was for the 2 burgers and fries ($65) this was not a great experience.",

We were seated quickly in the bustling dining room with a front-row view of the fast-paced kitchen. None of us was ravenous enough to go whole-hog with the menu options, so the kids and I ordered appetizers and my husband ordered the burger.   The suspenseful, long wait for our orders to arrive wasn't a surprise, but we're a squirmy bunch, so we had to exercise great patience as each of our neighboring tables received food before us. When our dishes finally arrived, they were every bit as delectable as we'd hoped for; the tomato soup paired nicely with the hummus and root veggies, and the Oreo shake with a the creme brulee topping was ridiculously good. I hear the burger was worth the wait, too. My only real complaint outside of the aforementioned wait is the menu prices - everything is pretty pricey and served a'la carte - not what you'd expect from a burger joint.",

    "text": "Hmmmm...trying to think of how to say what hasn't yet been said in the 2,112 prior reviews...let's see!  _________  + Service was very attentive and prompt; our drinks never went unfilled.   + I liked the energetic, buzzy environment. The giant fire sculpture felt both cozy and added to the lively feel of the dining room.  - Because GR Burger doesn't accept reservations, prepare yourself for the possibility of having to wait some time to be seated - especially if you've got a larger party. It took about an hour for our group of about 12 to be seated; I wouldn't recommend hitting this place for dinner if you and your larger group are in a big hurry. If you've got nowhere to be, however...then it's certainly worth the wait.  ________  + I've had Truffle Parmesan Fries more times than I can count, but the order that we received at GR Burger was quite memorable. For one thing, the fries themselves were substantial and tasted freshly-cut - there was a certain \"fullness\" to each bite that served as a welcome reminder that you were biting into real potato, none of that powder-like artificial BS. The Truffle Aioli was flavorful and earthy, too - I would've considered guzzling down the sauce by the spoonful, had I not been in public.  + I decided to go all-in (excuse the pun!) and ordered up a Foie Burger - after all, how often do you get to say that you're munching on foie gras at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant on the Strip? (Oh my, looks like the tourist in me was in full effect!)   The burger was a welcome balance between bold, aggressive flavor (courtesy of its wood-grilled patty, cooked to an exact medium-rare), and a more subdued counterbalance in the form of creamy, milky chevre cheese. The namesake foie gras added a welcome richness that took the whole burger that much more over the top - decadent enough to hit the spot, yet not so heavy that you find yourself overly stuffed. And yes, it's the type of burger best attacked with a fork & knife.  At $40 after tax/tip, this was certainly one of the more expensive burger & fries combos that I've ordered - but I guess that comes with the territory in terms of paying on-Strip prices!",

The only lacking factor was that our waiter kind of sucked and had a hard time getting a hold of him so we couldn't order anything else...  But the food! We started off with truffle fries and onions rings both were amazing but those onion rings! I've never had such yummy onion rings! Light and crispy made to perfection! It was sooo good I'm dreaming of my next visit already. The truffle fries were really good as well and you can def tell that the cheese they used was also really good quality!   Now the burgers! My and my friend had the stout, loaded with crispy onion and just the perfect amount of mustard. It was delicious and the meat quality superb! My husband had the Hell's Kitchen which was also really good!! I really wanted to try the nachos but unfortunately our waiter never came back to check on us or even when we asked someone to call him never came so we weren't able to order them. Definitely looking forward to our next Vegas trip to come back here again!   FYI - we got here at 1pm and waited an hour. Go early, put your name on the list if you're a party of 3 or more and go hang out till you get a text to get seated.",

    "text": "Poor customer service can really make or break a place, and here, it made for an incredibly poor experience.  I stopped by with a simple request: French fries to-go. After much confusion about whether or not to stand in the long line for the hostess stand (read: you don't have to), we placed our order for three fries. We waited for more than 40 minutes, despite being quoted a 15-20 minute wait, but the real bummer? When we got back up to our room at Planet Hollywood, the order was wrong: they'd given us two regular fries and one truffle fries instead of two truffle and one regular. The regular fries were kind of bland and soggy, but the truffle fries ($4 more) were out-of-this-world good! I just wish they'd given us two!   This restaurant can't be reached via phone (per the PH concierge) so I had to walk back in person to let the restaurant know what happened / get my $4 back. That's when things really went south. I got bounced around to three different people who were all SUPER rude. Each person passed me on to another, and I had to re-explain. There was a clear you're-not-worth-our-time vibe. One girl even had the nerve to say \"well it's been two hours since you were here so I don't think we can help you.\" I showed them the photos of the fries labeled and also how they looked inside. How is this not a super simple fix?! Finally after an hour of waiting, a guy came over and handed me four single dollar bills. My friends were texting me asking where I was, and my only response was \"that burger place is dead to me.\"  Yes, this is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. And yes, the place was slammed. But I can only imagine what Gordon Ramsay would say about messing up a French fry order -- let alone, having such mismanaged, chaotic staff. Even the best truffle fries in the world aren't worth the mess I witnessed here.",

I didn't mind the wait cause I knew it was going to be long. We ordered the backyard burger and Hell's Kitchen burger with fries. Waited 25 more mins for the food to come out. Kinda starving at this point. The food came out and was on point. The burgers we asked for both medium well and nice and juicy still. They were perfect. Fries were fries nothing special but just good to add it with the burgers. Portion size was good. Just enough. Don't want to over load my self. I would recommend this place.",

Lollipop wings: 5 stars, super flavorful and love the blue cheese crumble compliment. You don't even need dipping sauce to enjoy!  Hot dog: 5 stars love it. I love every component apart of this dish.  Stout Burger: 4 stars I def enjoyed it. I love the crispy onion to give it some texture. My burger was a little over cooked.  Service: 1 star. It took literally 10 minutes to get greeted. We went through 3 servers. No one seemed to be enjoying their job. Dirty plates left in the middle of our table throughout our experience. Service def could've been so much better. I recommend the food, but I really hope the servers here smile a bit more and enjoy working for such a popular restaurant.",

The truffle fries and onion rings are ok, but it's a beat steep to pay $10-12 for a side in my opinion.  Stick to the burger and a beer and you'll love this place.

Loss of a star was because the kitchen was running 30min behind but at least our server warned us (and we were starving) so we had the onion rings come out as an appetizer while we waited for burgers. So the onion rings were pretty damn great! Great amount of breading, crispy, not greasy. All the dipping sauces are obviously made from scratch. One is a ranch and the other a ketchup.   I had the stout burger and my husband had the blue cheese burger. Both are excellent and are truly packed with flavor! The mushrooms on the stout are so delicious! And the blue cheese flavor on the blue cheese burger packs a punch for all cheese lovers.  The fries are steak cut and fresh. If you are a shoe string lover these might not be for you. They also come with homemade sauces, two types of ketchup.   Lunch set us back about $60 Which included 2 draft beers so not exactly a cheap meal but definitely delicious and to be honest you don't eat cheap for GOOD food anywhere in Vegas.",

When we were seated we were greeted by our waiter who was brilliantly accommodating and super helpful. I ordered poutine, the foie burger, and sticky toffee pudding. The poutine tasted like an upgraded version of authentic poutine. The burger was quite different than any I've had before because of the cheese and the sauce and it was divine, probably the best I've ever had. I ordered the dessert assuming it was going to be a chocolate ice cream sandwich but it was actually toffee flavored, not a big deal tho because it was still bomb and I devoured it.   As for the vibe I'd say it's just above casual and it can get a bit loud. Be kind to your waiters/servers because they go through some chaotic shifts!",

It's such a beautiful restaurant with a wall of fire! Hello photo op! Be prepared the wait is usually over an hour. But you can put your name down and walk around the billions of shops in the Miracle Mile Shops. Right next to Burger is a Starbucks if you just want to chill or a super cool Tipsy Robot bar --- you can guess which of the two my friends and I hung at.  We were texted within our quoted time and our table was set and ready for our party of 8. Our server got the job done but I didn't find her anywhere on the friendly or informative level that I encountered at Hell's Kitchen.   We started with a couple orders of the Chips with Curry sauce ($8) and they were tasty fries. Enjoyed the unique dipping sauce.  Now on the drink front, I'm a beer chick and the beer list here is so cool! They have some standard beers but also just enough good, craft selections as well. why i the beer list so cool, you may ask? It was on this scrolling mini ipad with all the info I need when picking my beer. I always use Untappd when selecting my beer to see the percentage, flavors, brewery info and all that good ish. Well their ipad had it all, yay! And I found a good looking Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0 which they served in a fancy tall glass. All of Ramsay's spots are about the flare....and so I am so I'm completely onboard!  For my meal, I had the Hog Burger for $18. A lot of my friends missed this burger because it was under the specialities section instead of the normal burgers. But it IS special! It's huge with not just the beef but also mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw. Yep, she's a beast. So huge I couldn't come close to finishing it. They didn't ask how I wanted my burger so was happy it didn't come well done. No way, man, I usually like mine medium rare.  This was a fun place to dine with a group while all the Sunday games people wanted to watch played in the background so they could cheer along. It's a lively atmosphere, reasonable prices and tasty food - loved i!",

We tried the backyard burger, ultimate cheeseburger, and the Hog burger.  The backyard burger had great flavor. A little over done but tasted great The ultimate cheeseburger was a bit of overload. But still tasty. The hog burger was pretty damn good. Lots of pork and the onion straws gave it a nice crunch. No complaints on the burgers. Our only complaint was our fries. They were cold. We were starving so we ate our burgers and left most of our fries. Other than the fries we enjoyed our food.   Tip: do not sit on the wall where the banquette is. It is extremely uncomfortable and not padded well. By the end of the meal my back was sore. As was my daughters.",

If I could give it more than five stars I would! The hosts were very cheerful and accommodating. Once we sat down, Justin greeted us and gave us the complete run down of the menu. You can tell he is very passionate about what he does and has a lot of knowledge of everything on the menu. He made everything so personal and reccomended a few things for us to try. I am a total sucker for Buzzfeed Worth It episodes so I HAD to go with The Hog Burger. We also got the Truffle Fries. Everything was absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to go back again and try a new burger. A huge thanks to Justin for making our visit great!",

Of everything I ate I enjoyed the rings the most with the ranch sauce. The fries were edible but not terribly tasty. And the truffle dip was disgusting. If I had had a paper napkin I would have spit it out. The ketchup was good but not the chipotle ketchup. These apps were served without plates and the waiter disappeared fast and never came back. Rather than letting them get cold we dove in. Crumbs everywhere.  I ordered the pork burger which was cooked fine but a bit tasteless. It had several toppings measured by teaspoons so there was not much flavor added. My friend ordered the backyard burger with condiments on the side. They )didn't arrive with the burger and after 5-7 minutes I had to chase down a waiter, any waiter, to get them. It took another 10-12 minutes to find someone to pay our bill.    Due to the outrageous prices ($17 for a burger without fries and condiments) and Chef Ramey's reputation I just expected more.",

I chose this because I saw that it has some sort of duck bacon which immediately caught my attention. Tried it and it tasted great and unique. The meat was my favorite part; It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and everything. When it comes to portion, at first I thought it was a bit small. However I realized that it was at a pretty good portion to keep you happy and satisfied without feeling bloated. A side of fries could also fit right in.   Service was awesome. They check up more often than not and they're super friendly and sociable. As for the wait time, it took about 20 minutes. Not ideal but it's fine.  Would come back!",

Coming from the Midwest where we have the best beef in the world, I expected the \"gourmet\" to build on the perfect juicy, tasty burger (which even I know how to cook.). We were also very excited to see poutine on the menu, as my husband is from the birthplace of poutine (Montreal) and GR could only make it better, right?  Wrong on both accounts.  The patty in our burger, although cooked medium, was dry and tasteless.  Now a medium burger is pretty hard to dry out!  It was as if they took gourmet ideas and plopped them on a little bit bigger (being generous) McD's patty and put GR's name on it to make people think they were getting something g special!  The poutine was equally disappointing.  The gravy was a VERY strong pepper gravy (some people might like... for me a bit too strong.)  But the biggest SIN was to hardly put any curd chees on it at all!  That's the best part of poutine, and we were left fighting over the tiny, tiny morsels of chees sprinkled throughout.  Curd cheese is CURDS of cheese!!  Plus the reservation/call ahead/ you're screwed if your're only a party of 2 check-in system is wonky and ilexplained.    Bottom line... don't go!  GR would be embarrassed by these burgers!!",

I am very very disappointed with the restaurant and to some extent the food. The service is very bad and the staff is clearly overworked. I ordered the Hog burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the truffle fries. The Hog burger was welldone and COLD it must have been sitting around for a while. The fried we had to send back because they were stale and dry. The only good thing was the Hell's Kitchen Burger done medium well done to the T. The server was proactive and ready to replace our fried immediately but you should at least get fresh fried after 40 mins of waiting and not much crowd (most of the tables were empty since it was Sunday 10 p.m). No body likes cold fries or cold burgers. :( :(",

Explained the choices very well and made very good suggestions. Happened to also watch him find a package that another table left, picked it up and ran out the front after them to take to them. I had the Farmhouse burger. Didn't like the duck bacon but just removed it and enjoyed it without. I really liked the Parmesan truffle fries, husband didn't, he thought it tasted garlicky. He had the backyard burger and really liked it. It was more on the medium rare side and we asked for medium but overall good. Prices very reasonable.  The star for us was the dessert orange creamsicle- blood orange and a total surprise. I do get tired of similar desserts and this was a very pleasant ending to lunch. The manager was very present and engaged in what was happening with the patrons. Overall a very good experience",

The flames in the glass wall leading inside were a really nice/different touch. All the food my friends and I ordered tasted great but there was one major snafu! When one of my friends took the first bite of his Portobello mushroom burger, a LONG BLACK FABRIC STRING CAME OUT THAT HAD BEEN COOKED INTO THE BURGER! WTF?!!! We called our server over asap and she apologized profusely stating that the string was probably from the towels used in the kitchen to handle hot plates. But still - gross! If Gordon himself had been there that day to see that, he would have cussed someone out royally! She took the burger away and ordered my friend a fresh one. Then the manager came over and apologized and comped our bill for that order. A new burger came out perfect and we enjoyed the rest of our meal. But that incident definitely tarnished my opinion of this place. It was our first time here and other than that, everything else was on point. There was only about a 5 minute wait time too. My cheeseburger with several different British cheeses was delish as were the onion rings we shared, Cheddar soup, and truffle fries with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch. All-in-all and despite the \"string incident\", I would give it another chance and I plan to soon!",

Menus were waiting, and within 5 minutes we had water and placed our orders (Tandoori Chicken and the Hells kitchen burger, plus an order of the parmesan fries).

We ordered wings which were exceptional but I had to ask for ranch even though our server offered it to us. My husband's water glass had lipstick on it so we requested a new one. Burgers did take 40 minutes to arrive. Fries were average. Nothing special. I guess my expectations were over the top for a Ramsey restaurant. Burgers were very good though. We had the hells burger and blue cheese burger.",

Overcooked, dry, flavorless.   Cooking hamburger meat is easy, so there's no excuse for this!   Mr B got the Hell's Kitchen burger with jalapeno,  avocado,  dried tomato.   It had a good amount of heat and was pretty tasty.   Way better than that sad excuse for a burger I had.   There's a line to get into the restaurant, but it moved quickly.   The wait for the food was approximately half an hour!   Gordon ramsay should be screaming and cursing about that too!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I was not a happy camper (with my spouse) once I walked into this place and looked at the menu prices. I gave her the look.  OK. To start off, my family and another family were on a Spring Break trip in Vegas (don't judge). And my wife was in charge of most of the itinerary and she chose this place I knew nothing about. I guess she seen it on TV or friends or what. Well, once I walked in and glanced at the menu, I was like this place is NOT price friendly for kids and we have 3 kids with us. Ex. The hotdog was $17 (I think). Anyways I just frowned up until the point of the food arrival.  I ended up ordering a Cheeseburger as this is what they are known for. Again, wasn't happy with the price but I went along with it as planned. This place was very elegant and well thought layout. Live fires burning all around. You could see the kitchen in a distance as food was prepared. The wait staff was exceptionally polite and friendly. We actually held a 2-3 minute conversation that was pleasant as well. We ended up changing an order after placing it and the waiter was not upset at all for changing and also offered if we don't like something to let her know and she will exchange it. So I was impressed and feeling a little more at ease about the price issue (above).   The food arrived: I left out the part that my spouse suggested we order 1 french fries for my entire family of 3. Once the waiter placed our fries on the table, I was like wow. I should have listened to her. Ending result, we left several fries uneaten and I hate to waste good french fries.   Now to the burger. The burger size was a decent size. The meat looked hot and juicy. Quality of the remaining of the burger looked great. I was impressed. Once I bit into the burger, all i could say is Hmmmmm. This is pretty good. And it was as juicy and tender as it looked. Those damn fries (sweet potato) were on fire (not literally). They were VERY delicious. I wanted to make sure I ate all of those before helping with the regular fries ordered.   Hotdog: Yes, that $17 hotdog. That thing was huge. I was thinking no way my son will be able to eat half of it. The weenie was wrapped in bacon. With that notion, I really wanted to taste it. And once I did, it was delicious. I could have ordered it for myself and been happy. My son was able to finish half of it and he enjoyed it. We were all stuffed.  I recommend this place for the food mostly, and the amazing ambience they offer. And the cleanliness and wait staff.  All of it was amazing.",

Similar thing with our shared starters -- side plates for them arrived about 10 minutes later. The burgers were fine, but again, I'm not sure \"fine\" in that sense it what Gordon is after. I got The Crown Burger which has rocket/arugula and dried tomatoes. Sounds good but here's a thing: more arugula does not a better burger make, especially if you don't offset the dryness with more cheese. I love mimolette, surely everyone loves mimolette. give us more of that! This isn't fine dining, it's just fine. Prices are fine, wait was fine, service was fine, if a little amateur. Food was fine. F*ked off home.",

My friend at the time who was food and beverage manager for casino ended up taking over the manager position here. He kept telling me to come and that it was really good. I finally take him up on his offer and bring my friend along. When I tell you that everything we had was delicious......I mean EVERTHING! He decided to pick out all the courses for us from appetizer to the dessert. I can't remember what I had that time because it was many years back, but I do know that it was the most delicious burger I've ever had. I mean the meat was cooked to perfection and just melted in your mouth with every bite! I'm hungry thinking about it now. Been back a few times since then and the only thing that has changed is the five course meal! Everything else is exceptional and service is 5 star.

    "text": "I came here last Sunday before driving back home. I was going to eat-in but seeing the long line, I asked the hostess if I could get it to go, and hopefully, I could sit somewhere on the strip and eat it. I ordered the farmhouse burger and truffle fries. I was told that it would take 25min and that I could sit in the adjacent lounge. There was no space there because football games filled it up and I'm sure you have to buy drinks to sit there. I thought that I'd have nowhere to eat, so I asked if I could change my order to eat in and asked if there were seats for one. She said I could sit at the \"chef's table\"-(stools facing the kitchen). While I waited, I took my Rubiks cube out and started to solve it. I noticed the worker stop doing what she was doing and watch me solve it. Afterwards, she gave me a high 5 and I got a fist bump from the chef.        The girl (Lydia) asked where I bought my cube and I told her if I could write it down. I had said that I bought mine from eBay when the first came out with stickerless 7x7 cubes for about $50. Now that more companies have been making them, the price is now $23 from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cubicle.us&s=a05cee08a348ead3d66683fafba08d297bcd2eec2123681bf624ccd91122b912\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cubicle.us</a>, a company in upstate New York, which is good because you don't have to wait for it to come in the mail from China. She said she wanted to buy one for her sister or was it her daughter. I told her how I learned to solve it by watching how-to videos from a Prof. Arthur Benjamin, the creator of Mathemagic. I told her that I took a month to \"master\" the 3x3. and that I watched YouTube to learn the 4x4. I told her that you need to learn how to do centers with the 4x4, and if you know the 3x3 and the centers of the 4x4, then you can solve any sized cube.       Next, the maitre d and I talked about how to solve it, and I told him that the night before, I went to Wahlburgers and drank to see how much is needed to slow me down. I said its more fun when you are drunk because now I have to think harder instead of solving it on \"auto-pilot\". I drank 3 drinks and still didn't slow me down much. He told me that I should eat now before my food gets cold. This was the best burger I've eaten yet. It's too bad I was still stuffed from the last night. I'm glad I decided to eat in. I ate half my burger the fries. The fries were great and was probably made with all natural truffle oil. I've bought a Perigord truffle once and I've bought artificial essence of black and white truffle that you mix with olive oil. After being halfway done, I stopped and played with my cube until I was able to eat again. Finally, I chatted with the chef and asked him if he had met the man himself. He told me that he his nothing like the Hell's Kitchen persona and that he is very mellow nowadays. I told him about how I love the UK version of Kitchen Nightmare, where he can curse, but it is more evidence that he cares. Check it out on youtube. I will try other burgers next time and I hope the chef there will go far in his career just like Marcus Wareing. I wish I knew the name of the chef. Lydia had told me, but I didn't hear her clearly. I also wished I learned the name of Maitre D'. I totally recommend this place and recommend sitting at the chef's counter.",

    "text": "With the name of the venue and everything I originally came in here with high expectations. While it is indeed pricey however, these expectations were met. I had their signature pork burger and that monster was just oozing with flavor and juice. Delicious! Additionally, my friends and I also ordered the nachos for appetizer and while they did feel to lack some meet the overall dish was still fun to eat and flavorful to the tongue. To me this place was on gourmet burger place that actually feels worth it to come back to. Usually with most places like it, I'd just prefer simply going to in n out or five guys or something else like those. With this establishment however, like stated it is worth coming back to for both the food and the experience. You get to take home a souvenir menu for free, say you ate at a gordon Ramsey restaurant, and feel actually satisfied! Good stuff",

It is expensive for what it is, but not overly so for the venue and association. The food we have had all our life is given a different experience with different presentations, textures and flavors. Together, we shared the ale soup, Hell's Kitchen burger and onion rings. I don't think we can be regulars here, but we wouldn't mind coming back some day. Also, be prepared to wait. We came at the end of the day and there was still a small line; waiting 30-40 minutes. Others that came behind us reported the line was six times as long earlier in the day.",

I love burgers and was really looking forward to Burger and after a long wait in line, I found the burger to be nothing special at all. In fact, I would rate several fast food burgers better including Five Guys and Smash Burger...and Gordon Ramsay doesn't even come close to Bachi Burger in town.   The truffle fries were dry and bland. After reading great reviews, I was looking forward to those as well but another let down.  I did have the browned butter caramel shake along with my Innis and Gunn beer. The shake was delicious.   I had the ahi sliders as an appetizer. That was ok but nothing great.  All in all, not impressive. The line is really long and it's a bit pricey which was expected. If you want a great burger in Vegas, Bachi is the best.",

    "text": "With a location bearing the famous Gordon Ramsay's name, I expected much more.   SERVICE: The service was the most upsetting as the waitresses were extremely frustrating. I came with a party of 9 with them originally saying 45 minutes. After an hour, I asked of the status and a lady stated that \"it'll be 10 more minutes since they are now cashing out.\" Half an hour later, we, again, asked of the status. Their response: \"oh, we gave it to another group. Sorry. It'll be 15 more minutes.\" Each time we asked of the status, they would change the story of which table was \"finishing up\" and that it would be \"another 15 minutes.\"  Guess what? 40 minutes later, they still have not gotten us a table and we are the longest waiting group. Total wait time was 2.5 hours when they originally promised 45 minutes.   The service is poor and frustrating for such a famous location. If this location were to improve, improve the waitresses as they are just willing to improvise False stories and wait times.   FOOD: We decided to stay for the food since they made us wait 2.5 hours for a table they kept promising. The food was mediocre at best. The poutine was extremely salty and would bring even the healthiest person into hypertensive crisis. The meat was overcooked despite ordering a medium-- just overpriced for the hype. I am disappointed to give this a poor review especially since I am a big fan of Chef Ramsay.   ADVICE: Avoid this place. Just check out the Bobby Flay burgers near by. They treat you with respect there and the food is superior.",

It was light, but kept all the burger ingredients in place. The egg on mine was cooked perfectly, and the beef was seasoned nicely. I didn't think I could eat the whole thing, but I did. Perfection on a bun.   The fries came with two dipping sauces, ketchup and a house made aoli with black truffles and garlic. Super delicious.

Anyone who knows me knows that I have a strange yet justified obsession with all things Gordon Ramsay. That being said, my visit here was just not great. My friend and I sat at the bar because they said it would be a long wait and we just wanted to split a burger and truffle fries. The bartender told us the burger would take roughly 30 mins and I wasn't terribly upset about it because come on... perfection takes time lol in actuality the burger didn't come for an hour. And that was annoying because it was getting late and an hour to make a burger is kinda ridiculous lol  The burger itself was cold, very salty and kind of fell apart as you tried to eat it. The bartender was not attentive to us at all. After she took our order we didn't see her again. She spent most of the time talking to a friend.  In fact, when we finished a separate waiter saw us sitting there waiting and took our plates.  The only saving grace were the truffle fries but they are pricy.   Overall I wouldn't return if I visit Vegas again. Prices were too high for the product and the service during this visit wasn't great.   Still love Gordon though",

We started to wait for our turn since 7pm on a Tuesday evening and it took us about an hour to get a table for two. Our nice and friendly server gave us really clear explanations on items on menu and he even gave us a heads-up that our food would take at least 45 minutes to prepare, as the kitchen was busy.  We ordered the following for two of us without any sides, so as to not over feed our tummies: 1) \"Foie\" burger  The foie gras is just a spread on the bun. We weren't able to taste the foie gras spread as the taste of port wine aioli had overpowered the taste of foie gras spread. We probably won't recommend this burger, as it didn't look as appetizing as other burgers served on other tables. 2) Wheatberry-Quinoa salad The chicken skewer was tender and it went really well with the salad. The salad is slightly on a sour side. If there is some sweet mandarin oranges or sweet peaches added to this salad, this will be perfect! The portion is good to share among 3 or 4 people.   We will still go back to try other burgers.",

Got the hells kitchen burger.  That bread was so soft. The meat was a perfect medium rare. Tons of flavor. The garlic truffle fries was a generous portion of tasty from start to finish. Great amount of alioli. Id highly recomend coming here. There is an emphasis on quality here we havnt found at other places. Thanks!",

    "text": "300th review!  UPDATE: I love how they \"renovated\" so they could start over on Yelp. {/end sarcasm mode}  TL;DR: Go to Bobby's Burger Palace if you feel you must eat a celebrichef burger while in Vegas. Half the price, better burgers, better service, little to no wait, no tipped employees.  Don't believe everything you see on TV! I'm so disillusioned. Gordon, you were my favorite celebri-chef. I forsook Anthony Bourdain for you! I have been following Gordon religiously and watching every show of his I could get my hands on ever since I discovered F Word and the original Kitchen Nightmares on BBC America 12 years ago. My husband and I have been quoting him for over a decade. I have even made Amy's Baking Co references in a Yelp review. But the food here was NOT \"simple, fresh, and vibrant,\" as Gordon could often be heard barking at hapless failing restaurateurs.  The fries were hard and over-seasoned. The burgers, which we ordered blue rare, came out well done. Sending it back did not fix it (and I fear the saliva added by our disgruntled waiter did not improve the flavor either). They also tasted burnt and oversalted, and both burger and bun were dry and crumbly - the former because it was overcooked, the latter because it was old (tasted even older than the bread we used to throw away for being too stale at the bakery I worked at while putting myself through college). The shakes were too sweet to choke down more than a mouthful or two and had way too much crap going on. Not just the shakes, EVERYTHING down to the sauces was needlessly complicated: some additional flourish for the \"coolness factor\" or something, not actually contributing anything to the flavor, and often going one step beyond to actually detracting. The food was as gimmicky and smug about its cleverness as the name BURG(ordon)R(amsay). No hint of simplicity, freshness, or vibrance. Just over-complication, massive overcooking, and smugness.  We left 3/4 of our food untouched, which is like a 9th circle-level sin for us. The servers just cleared our plates without caring to ask if there was a reason we didn't eat very much of it.  So not worth the hype, the price, or the long wait.  If I were Gordon I would want to make sure that every restaurant that bore my name and likeness had service and food I was proud to put my name on, but I guess he would rather watch his bank account grow than work to protect the reputation he sweated blood for years to attain.  The only reason why I can't say this was the worst overpriced meal I've ever had is because BEAST exists.",

That's what resemble the patty's taste to me.. 5 of my other family members also got the lobster and shrimp burger. They didn't like it, but I think the other 6 enjoyed their beef patty burgers.

I'll admit I thought this place could be gimmicky but after a 40 minute wait in line plus an additional 30 minute wait for my food I was not disappointed! Got a counter seat looking into the chaotic kitchen. They were very busy (of course) but when I finally got my first item, the Creme Brulee Shake, I happily enjoyed sipping it! It was a very good shake as I could taste the Creme Brulee on the top but to be honest the actual chocolate shake underneath it tasted just like any other chocolate shake anywhere else. Next was the UK Burger which was very juicy. Juicy as in every bite I took of that meat patty was dripping of meat juice, not oil! What made it unique was they had some sort of sweet jam spread on it which balanced out well with the cheese. And finally the winner of the meal was the amazing Parmesan Truffle Fries! Now if you don't order this you'll be missing out, these fries are delicious but it is that truffle sauce that just blows it out of the water! Each time I dipped a frie into that sauce and took a bite I felt like I was melting into a sea of buttery truffle goodness. Overall I enjoyed the experience very much, I only wish the wait times weren't as long but hey it's a popular Gordon Ramsay establishment! Great things are worth waiting for!",

The fries were soggy and wasnt freshly fried, hence the one star knocked off.  Desserts were a bit overwhelmingly large in amount, simple and nicely done. I had the crem brulee oreo shake which was very well balanced, not too sweet, not too chunky with oreo.

If you are afraid to try some of the options, the ultimate cheeseburger is one I always suggest to friends trying it for the first time, and they always have rave reviews.

This place does not take reservations so it's first come first serve by waiting in line. Ppl were right and you do need to get in early. For parties of 3 or more, depending if there is a wait the hostess will take your name and number to text you when your table is ready. I thought this was nice instead of waiting so we were able to go play some games, plus we were still waiting for the rest of our party to join us.   The service was great, our waitress was real attentive and she kept our drinks refilled at all times. Plus she was good about letting us know how long the food would take to set our expectations which I appreciated. We ordered the kettle chip nachos to munch on while we waited for our burgers. They were pretty good and flavorful and crunchy. For the burgers we got the Hell's Kitchen which I  thought was cooked well and I loved the peppers and aioli. We also got the Parmesan truffle fries on the side. It was enough to feed the 4 of us. All the sauce accompaniments (we also asked for ranch) seemed freshly house made and were delicious!   Overall the meal and experience was great. I would definitely recommend coming back and would probably go again if we come through Vegas again.",

When we told them they rolled the eyes and put down the plates with attitude. They acted as if they were too good to even talk to us. No smiles just bitches. Sad that Gordon Ramsay hired these kind of snobs. My server on the other hand, he was great. No matter how great the food is, this kind of treatment leaves a bad taste.",

I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger (How could I not?!) and after about a 15-minute wait for our orders, everything arrived at our table hot and ready to eat.

    "text": "Our experience at Hell's Kitchen was truly a success. But how do the famous chef's burgers stack up?   Located in Planet Hollywood on the second floor, you'll find Gordon Ramsay Burgers. At $16+ a burger, you sure as heck get what you pay for. The burger is quite big and filling but doesn't come with any french fries or side dishes.   Pecan Milkshake: 5/5! By far, this was the best milkshake I have ever had. The rich buttery flavor profile of the pecans was out of this world. The caramel drizzle accentuates the butteriness and adds a nice sticky texture. The pecans were candy coated and absolutely delicious. The milkshake is incredibly thick and creamy. I highly recommend trying it. Don't leave this place without trying their milkshakes!  Poutine: 3.5/5 The fries itself were thick cut so you can really appreciate the potato profile. The gravy itself is delicious- savory, peppery, and rich. The short rib pieces were overly salty and unnecessarily fatty. The fries quickly became soggy and unappealing several minutes after it came out. It was nothing special and I definitely wouldn't bother ordering it next time.  Hell's kitchen burger: 3/5 Brioche bun was enjoyable- soft and bouncy. The burger itself was very bland and flavorless. The meat patty was juicy with a nice crunchy sear to the outside. However, the burger could use some special sauce or even just salt and pepper. The spicy aioli definitely went unnoticed and unappreciated.   Service was good. We came around 2:30 pm on a Friday and we waited 15 minutes. The host and servers were both friendly and polite. The burgers took longer than expected to come out (~20 minutes). Sadly the food did not live up to the expectations. At $16+ a burger, I would expect much better quality and more flavor. 2 burgers, 1 milkshake, & 1 appetizer quickly added up to $65 with no outstanding impressions on us.    If you must come here, just come here for the milkshakes. You won't regret it.",

I feel like the meat was just not as high quality as I'm used to a my favorite burger joint (Nom Burger in Sunnyvale, CA).

I ordered \"just fries\" as well for an additional $8 I think. The burger was truly cooked medium well. For some reason, people have issues with cooking to proper temps, this place got it right. The burger was hot, moist, tender, so flavorful. I loved it and plan on getting another one before I leave. I took off 1 star for the fries. They were awful to be honest. Even with the curry ketchup and regular ketchup. They were hot but tasted stale if that makes any sense. Which makes me think they were frozen. Fine, but they shouldn't be stale. I would stick with just a burger in the future.",

Pro tip 1: I *think* if you say that you want to sit at the bar, you can get seated faster!  -1 Service was mediocre. The lady who was supposed to be serving us was too distracted by her friends or someone who were dining in at the same time as us. She left us hanging for a while, and took forever to get us our checks because she was too busy taking photos with people she knew! Only glimpse of hope in this restaurant was the busboy who did everything. Double thumbs up for you!  We ended up ordering: 1) Truffle parmesan fries ($12): liked the sauces that came on the side! Pretty good portion size, and would recommend.  2) Farmhouse burger ($17): My favorite of the two burgers, just because I am a bacon and egg type of girl. Liked the sesame buns, and medium-well was cooked well! 3) Hell's kitchen burger ($17): This was a bit too much for me, but Allen seemed to enjoy it. A classic, if you don't know what to get here!  Menu: pretty simple, nothing super fancy.  Pricing: might be $1-$3 more than the average burger sit-down.   Was it worth the wait? Not exactly. Worth coming again? Nah. What about first timers?

    "text": "What a special and excellent restaurant! The wide array of options for food, more focused on burgers were spectacular with each unique style.  It's nostalgic of seeing Gordon grow on his TV shows, where he shares his passion for food!.. this restaurant definitely satisfied the fix of trying his restaurant. It is a good sized location and centrally located in the area of Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops.   For drinks I opted for Iced Tea as I was just stoked to be able to try the burger. For burgers I tried three in the mix including the hog burger and the Fish & Crisps burger which were delightful, but my main one that I ordered and devoured was: *Farmhouse Burger* with added mushrooms. For french fries I decided to get the best of both worlds: truffle parmesan and the chips with curry sauce. The burger was cooked to perfection and was magnificent and fries were appetizing, loved it all!   I highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Burger as a fantastic option when in Vegas. The service was great, ambiance was wonderful, and very, delicious juicy burgers!",

It was our first time dinning in. We started off with the Duck poppers and the Burnt Ends poutine. Duck poppers was good but thought there would be some duck meat in it but it was still good. Both me and business partners agree that the Burnt Ends poutine was really good with the bacon gravy. It could had maybe use a little more salt for the gravy but it was fine. We all had the Hog burger and I would say it's was soo good. We had a hard time eating it due to it was so y'all but hey that didn't stop us from enjoying it. With the BBQ pork and onions and the pork Patty wrap with bacon really kill it. After our meal we feel like we where going to be in a food coma and that felt so good.  Customer service: 5/5 Cleanness: 5/5 Food: 4.5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5  Thank you again to our server ( forgot her name ) for giving us a amazing time for our first being there. Would be back next year. Hope we have you as our server again if you're still there.",

We started out with the Burnt Ends Poutine, which was pretty good. We just found it to be a little salt. However, the main course didn't disappoint. I got the Forest Burger and OMG. The duck bacon makes this burger what it is. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Definitely will be visiting this place in the near future.  P.S: They supposedly use Creek Stone beef, which is halal",

For appetizers, we got the duck poppers and fries. First and foremost, what duck was there? The poppers were definitely 95% fried bread and 5% duck but alas, I didn't expect much of them to begin with. As for the fries, they weren't bad but they're not my style of fries and are obviously more akin to \"chips\" from the UK than my ideal thin pommes frittes soaked in duck fat.  As for the burgers, my friend ordered the foie gras burger and I ordered the turducken, both medium rare of course. The burgers were great, but I think I liked the foie gras a little more as the turducken was a little sweet and I prefer my burgers to be on the savory side. So why the three stars? In addition to the average apps (though the sauces that accompanied them were great), the bread that came with the burgers was nothing special. And I know the meat matters more, but so do the buns! All in all, GR Burger is a good spot but I feel like there's better options on the Strip.",

There's \"bouncer\" service and they open the rope divider to let you in. This is too fancy, Gordon.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my friend and I shared the sweet potato fries. The burger is served with asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno aioli. The spice profile was subtle, but the roasted flavor made the burger. I ordered my burger medium well, but I would recommend going with medium for these burgers. By the time it got to our table it was a little bit dry.   The sweet potato fries were served topped with powdered sugar. It was like eating funnel cake. I'm a fan. It also came with a sweet dipping sauce that was a little much so I didn't use it.  The restaurant is part of the casino floor in Planet Hollywood and is \"open air\" (indoors but no dividing walls). Surprisingly it did not smell smoky.",

I asked for it to be well done and server advised me it would still be a bit pink. The others I was with ordered different beef burgers.  The Hog Burger came out looking great. Cut it in half and it definitely looked pinker than I thought however I am not used to eating pork burgers and I am at a GR restaurant so I thought this was the bit pink the server was talking about. I was only able to eat half the burger as it was HUGE. After eating, I immediately felt VERY FULL borderline sick. The feeling did not subside and Fast forward 2 hours, everything I ate that night ..... came up.  I'm terribly disappointed that eating at a GR restaurant  and the food gave me food poisoning.   The beef burgers, fries and sticky toffee pudding ordered by the others I was with was all delicious and well worth it.   I hope the next time I visit a GR restaurant, I have a better experience.",

    "text": "My younger sister wanted to try out the burger so we dropped by this place. I was worried about the line at first, but it wasn't that bad. There is a sign that said for those with party of three or more to check in with the hostess. My younger sister checked us in and the wait was 10-15 minutes only. We were seated at a wobbly table. By the time my older sister joined us, we were ready to order. It was all about timing.  We all ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with different sides. There were the Kettle Chip Nachos, Just Fries, and Beer Battered Onion Rings.  The Hell's Kitchen Burger is amazingly good! I ordered it cooked medium rare.  The Burger: The buns were soft and have sesame seeds on the top. They will ask you how you want the meat cooked. A tip I learned from the radio is to ask them about the pink level of the meat. (Medium = show pinkness in the meat). The waitress mentioned they grind their own beef.  I liked the jalapeno and avocado in the burger. It is one of the less sodium filled burger I ever had and it was quite enjoyable. Usually I would put a lot of mayo in my burger. Not this one. The flavoring was already delicious. I was full after finishing it.  I'm also a fan of the Kettle Chip Nachos. The chips is crunchy and at the same time soft from the cheese.  I did not enjoy the beer batter onion rings. The first one didn't taste fresh since when I took the first bite, it wasn't burning the top of your roof mouth hot. About half of the onion rings were similar. The second onion ring, has oil saturated towards the part where it probably rested until it got scooped up for this order. I would not order the rings again.  I tried the Just Fries and they tasted fresher than the rings. They aren't as salty as other fries, which is how I like my fries.  Overall, my sisters and I enjoyed the burgers. I would come again, only for the burger. If I could, I would give this place a 3.5 star rating.",

    "text": "Been to this place a total of three times, I will most likely never go back and I seriously question if I will ever frequent a Ramsay establishment again.  Never say never, but right now, I'm not feeling it.  The first two times we were say right away because I am a Diamond Total Rewards member(meaning I've wasted a lot of money on gambling with little return, but I'm a Diamond).  The third time they seemed perturbed at having to seat anybody let alone me and my guest.  Then they say us at a regular table instead of a total rewards table, so that was upsetting but I didn't falter, I kept trying to make it a good dinner.  I am not a rich person, I spend my tax return every year on my vacation because otherwise I'd never get one.   I understand that most people just go on vacation and spend whatever because they have it to spend, I am not that person.  Nor do I drop over $100 on a meal on a whim for just two people.  The last two times I went I had the same thing, a Vegetable Hummus started, the Truffle Parmesan Fries and the standard Backyard Burger that ended up being a garden salad on a bun.  The fries were good, the food was great the first time around but the last it was just meh.  I felt like I was being treated less important because I was clearly a rube tourist that wasn't a VIP.  In other words, I was poor and not worth their time.  The room is crowded even without people at the tables, so I am unsure who designed it, but it should be noted that they did a poor job.  When I go to Vegas every year I always do one place that is a little out of my price range to maybe make me feel like I'm not in the lower class that I am.  Now because of financial circumstances I may not make it in 2019, but in 2020 I plan to go and a Ramsay restaurant will not be on my list of places to try.  I am giving this a 3-star because the food was ok, I do recommend always trying a place yourself to see if you can get a different experience.  You know, just to be sure for yourself.  I sent this review to Ramsay inc or whatever it's called, didn't expect a response, and did not get one so they'll never know how they ruined my vacation, but thems the breaks I guess.  Here is my full video review: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FZ02cWmt9WXc&s=353c558c18652ee6a75abb412c977bc947e537650c6bdff8598fc72db38b761d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/Z02cWmt9WXc</a>",

I know I should've said something but when your out on that las vegas strip for a bit and hungry as heck who would you jus want to eat. Burger was barely warm and fries were stale if it wasn't for the chipotle ketchup I probably would've said something it did take a little bit to long also  so. my bill was about $65 for 2 people that's about the norm i guess in vegas but I've could've gone to in and out burger and it be cheaper and fresh.",

I did see children in this restaurant, but I'm still saying it's not good for children because I'm not a fan of children in Vegas.  Too much for them to be exposed to at such a young age.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to rave enough about this burger.  The wait time here was minimal, we stood in line for ten minutes, tops, and spent that time gaping over the menu on the outside wall.  Once we were seated, we were waited upon in short order, by a friendly server named Guy.  I forgot the name of the burger I got, but it was the once with a fried egg on top (farm burger?  barnyard burger?) and it was exquisite.  I like my burger medium rare, and usually I struggle to get a place to cook it for me medium rare, but this one came out right at the perfect temperature.  It was juicy, and flavorful, and all the accoutrements included upon it were scrumptious, also.  The fried egg was perfectly fried (overcooked eggs are a huge no-no for me) and the yolk was velvety, and rich.  Just an all around excellent burger.  The fries were okay, the onion rings were okay.  For those you are provided with a few sauces, one it a curry flavored ketchup, which lo and behold tastes like curry.  There is also a chipotle ketchup, which was tasty, but I didn't get much chipotle out of it.  The third is a cheddar ranch which was mindblowingly out of this world.  I would have ordered more fried to get more of this cheddar ranch.  It tastes like ranch dressing, without the acidic finish, instead replaced with a creamy smooth cheese flavor.  I've never had a ranch quite like this, and I lament that I will probably never find a comparable copycat recipe.  Overall the burger was worth the price, really tasty, cutesy restaurant, good service...a good experience for the low to mid budget gordon ramsay fan.",

I ordered his wings , blue cheese burger and truffle fries. Let me start off with the wings. Amazing!!! Hot moist and very flavorful. I could have had move if I didnt order the burger and fries lol. The burger was very good also and the sauce was very good. The only poor side for me was the truffle fries . They came out lukewarm and didnt have a great taste to them. But overall a must visit place. Just make sure you bring some money. Not good for the cheap at heart people.",

    "text": "So, as I bit down into my Hell's Kitchen Burger, the first thing I notice was the juiciness of my medium patty. The spices dancing over my tongue, teasing my taste buds. That's when the roasted Jalepeno shows up. Pulling my sense back into another realm, taking me back home. Who is waiting there for me? The avocado, nestled gently between patty and melted cheese. Not to be ignored, the roasted tomatoes waited patiently on the asadero slice, patiently waiting thier turn to remind me what bliss is like. Presented to me, all by itself on a lone plate, top bun slightly upturned to display all the tender and juiciness inside, eagerly waiting to be inside of me.   Just when I thought my culinary trip into ecstasy was complete, my golden fries still steaming. Two sides of ketchup await me, both spicy enough to leave just the faintest impression on my senses. The golden slabs of potatoes, patiently await my choice into thier ketchup, but oh.. what is this? Truffle Parmesan Fries, you saucy little minx. How can these golden delights be topped? Oh, my friends, I will tell you. Large, perfectly crisped onion rings. My only regret with the rings, is that none were presented as a ring, a token of undying and committed love.  At long last, I've reached the conclusion into the love tunnel of my taste buds. Escorted though an cornucopia of delight, I found myself not wanting for dessert, for fear of falling into blissful slumber, filled with winged fries and haloed hamburgers.  Buuuuut.. they didn't have Coke. 3 Stars.",

Not only did a friend tell me this place was good but I'll such a Gordon Ramsey fan!!   Anyways, where they lose stars was our waiting time. For 1 burger and an order of fries we waited over 40 min. Larger parties that sat after us were already eating way before our food came out. By the time we got our food we were pretty hangry and not understanding why 1 burger took so long.

I also ordered a caramel butter pecan milkshake and it was smooth, sweet as home milkshake made like how grandma would make it.  My critique is the service was not present. I waited about 15 min to remind for our milkshake which was to be brought at the end of our meal. And then more time again to wait to ask for the bill.  I'd honestly go back again, the burger and fries are really, really good. And then update my review if it's just an anomaly.",

    "text": "Parties more than two, or maybe three..., sign in and they text you when your table is near ready. Otherwise wait in line, which is long, but moves fairly quickly. Drink orders come out fairly fast, but burgers take a while. We were told up to 45 minutes on the burgers, but they came out in under 30, all perfectly prepared.  Burgers: Universally loved. We tried a few varieties, and all were outstanding. I ordered the hog burger, which I never would have guessed was not beef. It appeared impossibly large, but the airy brioche bun makes it far less filling than you would think. Everyone finished their burgers easily, with room for fries, which were also very good. Cocktails were excellent, even compared to today's omnipresent competition with regards to the new Bohemian mixologist culture.  I gave it four stars, as I told my family it wasn't the best burger I've ever had. When they asked me to name a better burger, I couldn't do it, but was certain I must have had a better one at some point. This is place you would be happy to experience, even if you aren't a celebrity chef nerd like myself.",

The lines are pretty long on the weekend, but if you're here during the week hit this place up then. It's absolutely delicious and worth it!   Great vibe here with that amazing fire wall! Our waiter Andre was excellent, quick, and very friendly. He was able to help us pick out the burgers we wanted and the beverages that best suited our meals. The onion rings are just fabulous! That batter is light and so crispy plus the dipping sauces are spot on with flavor.   I got the farmhouse burger and added spicy mayo. I ordered mine medium and it came out just perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised at just how well it was cooked and seasoned. This burger was messy but sooooo delicious.   My friend got the forest burger and said the duck bacon was a highlight. Definitely something you don't want to miss I got a lovely blueberry antioxidant cocktail that was so refreshing after a hot Las Vegas day. If you can ask for Andre as your server!",

They will seat you faster if you're willing to sit at the bar. Our waiter mumbled and said something while he turned his head and walked away. All night as he refilled our cups and gave us our food as he mumbled something. We really wanted to hear what he was saying. We started with the duck poppers - they don't taste like duck. I couldn't find the duck. Just cheese and bell pepper (not spicy) Not sure what I was expecting but it was just cheese and breaded bell pepper to me. Hell's Kitchen burger was juicy and cooked perfectly- but I thought it was bland and needed more flavors or something (jalapenos are a nice kick) My husband had the hog burger - he said it was okay - the meat is packed in there dense. Onion ring tasted oily to me. We went bc it's GR - and you want to go bc it's his restaurant- but for us it's a one time deal. The food and service was mediocre, but the ambiance is really nice for a date.",

See from my photos. If gluttony is your liking you may be in heaven. The burger was on the better side of OK but this place has been so hyped up so I was expecting more. The flavour was OK. You could tell that the meat was fresh not frozen.  Overall is was a 3.5/5 it wasn't bad just it wasn't exceptional. I was actually more impressed with the Parmesan truffle fries. These were damm delicious.   If you come here and have no special status (Caesars cut the line status) expect to wait a long time in line. We were fortunate we didn't have to wait in line but there must have been 25 people in line when we were there.   Service was good. No issues here.   Maybe I need to try a few more items on the menu. I'd say give it a chance but don't come in here with huge expectations.",

I decided to try the pork chop and applesauce burger. It has a pork patty, dubliner cheese, branston pickles, apple braised pork shank, and cabbage apple slaw. It was heavenly! The pork patty and pork shank was cooked perfectly with the right amount of flavor. I'm not a huge fan of cabbage but I loved it with the apple slaw mix.   My friend and I also shared the Parmesan truffle fries and onion rings as appetizer. I highly recommend sharing the fries for sure because it's a huge serving!   We also got drinks. I got the Chombolita and my friend got the New Old Fashion. Their drinks I find more on the sweeter side.   The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the wait. Get there early for dinner! We got there about 7:30pm and waited in line for a good 45 min. The burgers also takes 30 min to make...so don't come here starving.",

If you're a party of four or more then make sure you check in before waiting in line.  Excellent beer selection that changes regularly and the serving staff is friendly, professional and knows their product knowledge.  I had the Specialty Hog burger with outstanding onion rings. Sick Japanese boy coworker had Tomato soup with a baby grilled cheese sandwich that actually helped him feel better. Other coworker had Spicy Burger with jalapeno on the side and it looked great.  Cherry Wheat by Sam Adam was chilled to the proper temperature (cold).  It was a good experience and I thought a decent value for the creativity and location.  Definitely try it.",

We only waited about 10-15 minutes for a table. Larger parties of 3 or more would put their name on a list. We had a group of 3 couples and it was an hour to sit together or 10-15 for separate, so we opted just to eat separated since we were on a time crunch. I got the forest burger and really enjoyed it. It had a great balance of flavors between the mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. It was a good burger, but no the best I've ever had. My husband got the farm burger and it was heavier tasting with the egg and bacon. Definitely has more of a comforting feel to it. The truffle fries were good but a little on the salty side. It was quite a huge serving (makes sense because it was $12) and we couldn't finish it.",

Best burgers ever with a reasonable price! - Always a line- come at an off time for ease of waiting, but worth waiting for to even try if you are skeptical  - Better to come with a small group of of 3 or more. The sign tells you to let the hostess know and they will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. It looks like they do this so because there is always a line if you have 1 or 2 people. Since most customers eat in pairs or alone they just have to wait for a table to open. We get our table within 30 min and the servers are great. -BEST PARMESAN FRIES EVER~ HOUSE MADE KETCHUP IS THE BEST THING EVER MADE. TASTES SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! YOU HAVE TO GET HIS FRIES!!!!",

As for the taste, I was underwhelmed. Given this burger is about the blue cheese, I was surprised how little blue cheese flavor came through. Certain bites showcased the cheese and figgy jam nicely, but too many did not. Like the cheese, I wanted more jam than what was provided.   The meat itself was okay. If you want a juicer burger, you may want to try it medium rare. For a gourmet burger, I found it fairly generic.   The bun was solid. Not spectacular, but fresh, tasty, and the multicolored sesame seeds were nice.   I paid ~$21 total with tax and tip. My burger was $16.   Takeaways:  -if I could do it again I'd order the forest burger (I'm a fan of mushrooms and bacon on burgers, and the duck bacon sounded good) -worth trying for the experience, and the menu has several burger options, but don't expect to be blown away",

    "text": "So lets start with the venue. The restaurant has a clean look and feel that tilts towards a group setting or even a casual date. Service is great, the decor is eye catching, and the music is not in your face.   Now onto the food:  Truffle fries: Straight fire. But ask for extra ketchup.   Sweet potato fries: Yes I know the name says sweet, but I guess personally most of the time I have sweet potato fries they're not really on the sweet side. These ones also had a layer of sugar on top which really gave it that side, so personally I wasn't a fan and would've just struck to the truffle.   Forest Burger: I am a big mushroom person which is why I was leaning towards this one, and I will say that the mushrooms had a TON of flavor. The burger overall was pretty tight. I will say that there was a unanimous decisions that all of the burgers we had were slacking on saucing. So it really tasted like a patty and then your veggies on top. Similarly, i'd recommend asking for an extra sauce.  Finally the milkshakes were very very underwhelming. They only had three flavors and they weren't thick at all. I like True diner style milkshakes and this wasn't that. Of the three flavors I would recommend the butterscotch, even though I typically go for oreo flavored.",

However, that soon took a turn for the worst. We had four people in our party and ended up waiting an hour for food! Yes... an hour for burgers! The server and manager both came over and apologized for the inconvenience and comped the meal, however the bad service continued. Once the meals came, we realized that my husband did not receive pickles on his and one of my guests did not receive her meal.  She had to wait a few minutes before she got hers! When we asked the server about it, he replied \"Well you are getting it for free.\" To top it all off, we had to ask for simple things like water and lemonade refills. Its as if the service went down the window bc the server assumed we would not tip. So finally, the server came over to ask us if we wanted dessert. I replied yes and once we received the desserts, we got a bill too! To my surprise, i was under the impression that the entire meal was comped. When I asked the server about it, he replied \"i honestly didnt think you would want dessert since you have been here a long time.\" Are you kidding me? I couldnt even make this up! He stated he should have told us that WE were responsible but did think about it. So i prepared to pay but then he stopped by again and said that it would be comped as well. I have never experienced this sort of service here before and wont again. I refuse to come back.",

    "text": "This is our 1st visit to this eatery.  While the food was good (had the stout burger & wife tried the farmhouse with the onion rings side order), disappointed that overall service was sub-par for this pricey eatery by Gordon Ramsey.  First, when we approached the hostess booth, my wife mentioned we had a reservation (likely not needed for lunch or none at all  as many tables were available), one of the hostess named Kat or Kathy not only didn't care to ask for the reserved name or time but also rudely pointed us to a close-by table instead of walking us to a specific table; as there were 2 available next to each other, we guess it was up to us to pick one.  Then, after we sat down for about 10 min without a waiter / waitress, we had to ask a for one.  Dawn, our waitress, shortly came & told us to wait for a little longer; we figured her section was busy, but felt that could have been better to inform us early so we didn't have to ask for 1 or waited a while; after the food came out, however, we liked that Dawn did come to check on us twice to see if all was well.  Any rate, before leaving I decided to inform a manager named Joe that we were not impressed with the overall service, esp. an unfriendly welcome by a hostess; so, likely won't come back again.  Had we known about this lackluster service, would have gone to Mesa Grill to try for another well-known & quality burger there    The Gordon Fish & Chips, on the contrary while not a full-service eatery & less pricey, we were impressed with the attentiveness & friendliness by the staff there & the food, of course, was very good as well.",

    "text": "When we were in Vegas, we knew we had to try at least one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant this time around. We are extremely happy we got the chance to try his infamous burger joint. We were worried about the long wait especially since we were going on a Sunday, it was a holiday weekend, and there was a marathon event happening later that day so Vegas was even more crowded than normal. We found a phone number on Google (the Yelp phone number is just to make reservations to OTHER restaurants since this restaurant doesn't take reservations only walk-ins) and they said the wait was only about 20-30 minutes. We hustled our way to PH from Venetian and surprisingly enough we only had to wait 30 minutes in line! When you do come here do expect to spend some time here so make sure you don't have any immediate plans. We waited in line for about 30 minutes, ordered our food fairly quickly upon sitting (I recommend you look up the menu and decide what you want to order while in line), and then wait about 15-20ish minutes for your food to arrive. The food does take some time to prepare, but it is worth the wait! We ordered the farmhouse burger, the hog burger, sweet potato fries, and oreo creme brulee milkshake. Everything about the meal was delicious and very filling. The burgers are HUGE which makes sense for its price point. It is definitely on the higher end for a burger, but it is bigger and has extra flavor profiles that make up for it. We split the burgers so we were able to try both. Both were delicious and super flavorful. We both prefer the farmhouse burger slightly more because it is more of a classic burger that is extremely well done, super juicy, not overly seasoned, plus who doesn't love a fried egg on top! The hog burger was very tasty as well if you are wanting to try something different. This burger is MASSIVE packed with a ton of meat. The patty, pulled pork, and bacon all compliment each other, one was not overpowering the other. If you are a huge meat lover, I would definitely recommend this to you. The patty was not as juicy as the farmhouse, but it didn't have to be since it had the other flavors from the pulled pork and bacon to enhance it. I would definitely recommend the creme brulee milkshake as well, unless you are not a huge sweets fan. It is pretty dense and sweet, but if you love creme brulee and oreos, this is the drink for you.",

The food service is a little on the slow side (took 15 min to bring out our appetizer and another 15-20 min to bring out our burgers) but it's due to the fact that the kitchen cooks everything to order and they take their time to ensure high quality. Plus I asked my patties to be cooked well-done which they did perfectly!  Blue burger: 5 stars! Loved the complex flavors! Hells Kitchen burger: also 5 stars, but I prefer the Blue burger more if I had to choose between the two.  Chips and curry dip: 5 stars... super fresh potato wedges, big portion, and delicious yellow curry dipping sauce.  Worth the hype but I probably won't wait in line for this.

But we were hungry & it's Vegas, so we moseyed over to Gordon Ramsay Burger because we heard good things and I was left pleasantly surprised. Although it's open to the walkway / casino nearby, it's not too loud or distracting in there. We saw lots of families while we were there.   The menu is extensive and there are LOTS of options for food. Our burgers both came perfectly medium-rare & very juicy, but not overpacked with toppings so that it dripped or fell apart when you ate it. I didn't have to use my fork once. I'm not picky about my food and feel messiness is part of the burger-eating experience, but it's nice when food feels balanced & thoughtfully arranged. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was a little spicier than I had assumed it would be (because I always assume 'spicy' is really not that spicy, unless it's a Thai restaurant or something) but not overpowering, but a lot of the burger options were interesting & I had a hard time choosing! The truffle parmesan fries were good too, crispy & flavorful with just the right amount of saltiness from the parm. I'm not a huge truffle parmesan fry person (it's like the lowest common denominator of 'fancy' pub food, it's practically ubiquitous for gastropubs) but these were good.  I'd definitely recommend showing up before lunch because as we were eating, the wait became exceptionally long & nobody got time for that. Even after lunch hour, the wait becomes so congested that I'm not sure it significantly lessens up. This is a good option if you're looking for a nice-but-casual lunch or trying to feed a group; or if you're a family with kids.",

    "text": "This is a mixed review based on two different burgers and the overall experience my wife and I had while in Vegas recently.    Atmosphere 3/5.  The place is clean and well decorated. We were at a high top table next to the glass window and flames and so that was fun.    Service 1/5. Of the many places we ate at in Vegas, the service here was by far the worst. Our drinks were never filled, even when we asked. It took over 45 minutes to get our food once it was ordered and not a single person stopped by to check on us during that time, even to let us know it was taking a little longer.  The server wasn't friendly, energetic, or even seemed to want to be there.  A huge turndown for such a respected place.    Food 2/5. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger with hopes that it would have some flavor with the roasted tomato, jalapeno, and avocado.  The burger itself was extremely flavorless and the toppings didn't add anything to the burger either including the sauce that was supposed to be good.   The sweet potato fries were fine.  Nothing special.  The dipping sauce was good though.  I would have preferred them a little bit more crispy.  The reason this wasn't a 1 star was because of the Fish and Chips burger my wife got.  It was actually super good.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  The crispy potato straws were great and the lemon aioli that was on the fish was extremely tasteful.    Unfortunately, I will never go back to a GR burger as it was a sad disappointment.",

Just letting you know now that there will be a line and you will have to wait. My Boyfriend and I were a little disappointed with the Menu changes and it looks like Ramsay did a lot of consolidating on his BURGR menu. The favorites were still on there but the appetizer section was lacking and we didn't order any because of that. BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT- trust me. We both got Burger's (can't remember which ones) and a side of Truffle Fries. It's delicious, and when we advise them we want it cooked Medium Rare you best believe it comes out exactly at that temperature!! This place is amazing and you have to try it at least once if you're skeptical!",

    "text": "Visited restaurant expecting a great dining experienced butafter waiting a long time after ordering, my backyard burger needed seasoning ( the burger patty could have used salt and pepper).  Conversely, the french fries were too salty and were too crisp ( on the border of burnt). This \"gourmet\" burger and fries are over-rated and way overpriced. Plain old ketchup would have been more appropriate and less salty that the curry and chipotle mixed ketchup preparations they served with the french fries. I had to beg the waiter to come and provide a refill of my beverage...The place was a clip joint!  In and Out with its mass produced burgers and fries are much better prepared and their staff are more courteous.  I was very disappointed with the food and the service, the place was also very noisy, you couldn't hear your dining partner across the table.  Nicole O:  Thank you for your note to me regarding the aforementioned review, the staff person was a shaven headed fellow working about 7:30pm - 9:00 pm on January 18th and he had the section near the register/order computer near the flame window and the booths.  He served the two-person tables.  He gestured rudely to me when I signaled that he come to our table for water, it seemed he was overwhelmed serving the two tables on the sides of ours.    Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Las Vegas for a good while. Truly, I appreciate your offer to return to your restaurant and give it a second chance. Thank you very much and best wishes.",

    "text": "(A little later review on this one....)  While I had high hopes for this place, I got to say, I was really disappointed.   I strolled up on a Friday afternoon, a little after 12:45pm  to place a take out order, as I was staying at PH and just wanted to grab something and take it up to my room.    The girls up front were friendly and eager to help, but seemed to be having a problem with swiping their cards and being able to log in to take my order.   They went back and forth between 2 different machines and called over like 3 different people to try.   Eventually they got it figured out and took my order.   I ordered onion rings, (asked for an extra cheddar ranch) and a burger cooked medium rare.   She repeated my order, but neglected my request for an extra ranch, so I kindly asked if she got the extra ranch part.   She said \"Oh yah, don't worry\"  MMMMMMoK.  So I pay for my order and she tells me it'll be 30 minutes.   I was a little surprised, but was fine with that, hoping that since it was just a single burger and a side that it may come closer to the 20 minute mark.    It's now a few minutes before 1:00pm.    I go off and gamble in the casino a bit and come back at 1:30 thinking that the order should be ready.   I go back to the counter and ask the girl if my order was ready.    She tells me to wait on the side and she'll go check.   She goes off in the back and comes back a minute later and is just having a good time with her friends up there.   She's helping other customers and then talking story again with her co-workers, having a great time.   All the while, I'm just standing there.  5 more minutes go by and I go back up there and kindly ask if she found out if my order was ready because she clearly had no intention of letting me know what's going on.   She tells me \"oh yah, they're checking on it\".   Oooooooooook, well you could've at least told me something.    Another 5 minutes go by and now I'm just starving already.   Finally after 50 MINUTES, the girl comes up with my food like nothing ever happened.   She tells me thank you and is about to walk away.   I ask her is the extra cheddar ranch in there? and she tells me \"Oh, did you want an extra one?\"   Uhhhhhh yes please, I already had to ask for it twice when ordering, why not one more time right?    I mean is that a difficult request to get correct?    She gladly gets it for me and I'm on my way back up to grind!    I'm all excited when I get back to my room thinking this meal is going to be hot and delicious......NOT!    No joke guys/gals, the burger and onion rings were not even warm.   Seriously, not even warm at all!   Oh and my burger was almost cooked well done.   On the flip side, Gordon's onion rings are BOMB (even when cold)!    The burger though was super disappointing.    Obviously because it was room temperature and over cooked, but it was also under-seasoned too.   Sooooooo disappointing.     I thought about calling down and letting a manager know about it, but was just over it already.  We went through our apps, sides, and steaks in less than 50 minutes at Gordon Ramsay Steak earlier in the week, and it was amazing.   The Burger joint.......not so much.   So many better options in Vegas.",

We also got truffle fries, which were probably the weakest thing we got, but still good. We got really in to truffle last year when we went to Italy, and when you order truffle anything in the US, they give you a little measly bit of truffle. Not GRB, they loaded it up. It was almost too much truffle. Other than that, I can't wait to go back!! My favorite part of Vegas!",

    "text": "I was sat at the bar immediately at lunch time on a Wednesday.   I've watched Gordon Ramsey's burger tutorial online a million times, so I had high expectations. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium-rare as recommended. It was perfectly cooked meat, juicy, tender, well seasoned. It's hard to keep that slippery jalapenos pepper in there when you bite into it! Definitely provided a balanced kick without overpowering it, but definitely makes for messy eating and constant burger management. My bun was under-toasted for my taste, very minimal color when I opened it up. My friend's was perfectly toasted. So a bit of bun inconsistency. For a $18.40 + tip burger, I really think just a few fries could be included. Even in Vegas. Or maybe offer a half portion fry volume. It's a large burger so no way I could have finished fries and definitely not at half the price of another burger ($8-12). But I would have liked to try them. I'd still like to try the Farmhouse next time.   The spot at the bar had a/c blowing directly at me. Ok... I put my fleece jacket on. Still fricken freezing. 2 if the 3 men working behind the bar looked really unhappy to be working here. They weren't inhospitable, just appearing uninviting.",

None of us really liked our burgers that much (our table ordered three different types). For a $17 hamburger you expect it to be good and it was mediocre at best. The fries were OK, the house made sauces were weird (curry ketchup, chipotle ketchup, etc). We were so disappointed.  Would definitely not eat here again. Does not measure up to the hype.",

It's literally the physical brick and mortar restaurant embodiment of the man himself.  In True Gordon Ramsay fashion, his restaurant takes on the famous chef's personality, with flames engulfing his patrons as they dine. His menu offers a selection of delicious burgers, fries, and beverages in a sit down and flame infused environment. Make sure to come early, and put down your name - the wait time can be excruciating!",

I guess if you don't sell out then you will never become as famous!  The waiting line is about an hour to be seated and if you are a vegetarian, there is a choice of a portobello sandwich on the menu, but you are gonna pay for it at ($17)!  I have heard rumors that Gordon despises vegetarians, so this just confirms it for me!  He permits you to come to his restaurant but you will pay 2 more dollars for that non-meat sandwich!   It took about 30 minutes for our food to be served.  My partner got the the burger. It was too salty and the tomato had not been cut properly because it had the brown end still on one of the pieces. What Gordon, you allow that?  The plain french fries ($8) were fresh cut and fine, but a bit stale/cold when we got them to our table. They do not come with the burgers, so you would need to order them separately. The positive thing is they are a large portion that can be shared between 2 people.  Overall, it was not a great meal and we will not be back. We were expecting much more from you Gordon.   As Donald would say, \"You're fired!!!\" Otherwise Gordon, best get your butt back into that kitchen to check!  Update: When I got home I got horribly ill and was up all night. I am allergic to canola oil and cannot stomach GMOS, so I suspect that they are using canola oil and/other GMOs in this restaurant!",

    "text": "We we're so excited to try Burger. Finally getting the chance, we stopped in Saturday night right before 6. Surprisingly the line was short and we were seated within 5 minutes.   Our server was great, super informative. We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, Blue Cheese Burger and Truffle Fries to share. Our waiter told us it'd be about 20-25 minutes for food. I did think that was a little awkward to tell us that, but I appreciated the honesty. We weren't in any rush.   By about 30-35, our food came out. Looked amazing. Cut my burger in half a saw it was definitely well done (we had both ordered ours medium). Not a big deal but when Red Robin can get a burger done-ness right and not Gordon Ramsay, that's a bit of an issue.   The burger was great except the patty. All of the flavors were there. Loved the kick of spice and my boyfriend loved everything about his Blue Cheese burger. Except the party. Not sure why we waited that long to have over cooked burgers.   The truffle fries had the same issue. The flavors were amazing. But the fries tasted like they sat under the heat lamp waaay too long. And no surprise, if you looked over to the kitchen you saw rows of fries sitting under the lamp.   The kitchen was clearly behind which surprised me at 6 on a Saturday, not what I would think would be the dinner rush. There were plenty of empty tables around us.   Seemed like they were waiting for the kitchen to catch up because they stopped seating people for about 15 minutes. By then, the burgers seemed to come out a lot quicker.   I really wanted to like this place, and had our burgers been not been cooked to death and our fries sat out, it would have been 5 stars.   Service 5 stars. Flavors 5 stars but it's the kitchen that brought it down. Work on efficiency and this place would be so great.",

If you eat fish at all, this is a must have. It is truly incredible, so much flavor. For my entree I had the lobster and shrimp burger. This was exactly how I would imagine a seafood burger and so much more. Perfect everything. On top of that, the service was absolutely exceptional, the best I ever experienced, anywhere.

It turned out that it didn't take as long so that was a pleasant surprise.  My favorite item on the menu would be the onion rings!!  They tasted amazing and had a good crunchy texture.   They also had a good drink menu with good cocktails.  Overall this is definitely a place I will be back to whenever I am in town.",

The only criticism is that for parties of 3 or more they want you to visit the desk and they will text you. This is great except hardly anyone in line is aware of that, as its not clearly posted and the line is usually long. Another note about the line and that is it's usually hot in Vegas and they have you stand next to a firewall. This is an actual wall of fire, it looks neat but not so neat if you're hot. One you're seated it's great, friendly knowledgeable staff and the food is impeccable.",

    "text": "Unreal! Wow! If you are craving a perfect burger unlike any other in texture and flavor, this is the spot. This experience was excellent from beginning to end. Friendly greeting at hostess stand as we awaited our table. Our server was prompt, informative and attentive. Top notch service with much consideration.   Due to the volume of this establishment it takes 25-30 minutes to receive your burger of choice. Server recommended a starter since it is delivered quicker. The corned beef nachos served over hand cut potato chips were incredibly rich and delicious.   Kale/Romaine Caesar salad was amazing! The dressing was the star of this beautiful salad. Let's just say I never felt like one could be addicted to a salad but this one will get ya!!   The burger: OMGoodness! Unlike any other. It looks modest when it arrives but one bite and you know everything about it is special. We ordered the UK Burger, it is topped with Dubliner cheese, chutney and arugula on an absolutely perfect bun. The bun is topped with black and white sesame seeds and is pillowy yet hearty. The meat was so buttery and seasoned to perfection. You savor each and every bite and don't want it to end. It leaves you eager to try every burger on the menu.   There is a wide variety of burger choices and many appetizers to choose from. Fries are a la carte.   Even though the line can get long it is definitely worth the wait. If you are a burger lover or connoisseur  then it's worth the trip.",

    "text": "Not really a burger burger fan, sorry.  But we absolutely enjoy this restaurant.   We try and visit every time we are in Las Vegas, (the party City). First came here because our fight was delayed and we arrived very, very late and surprisingly the only restaurant we could find open at that hour was Gordon Ramsay Burger. The flame display in the window let us know we were in for something special. Food was excellent that visit and lightly fast service.  The sweet potato fries with powered sugar are the best fries anywhere, love them.  We visited a few times and again over this last weekend and the service was super, super slow because they were so busy that night.  We had seating with a view of the kitchen and we were amazed by the pace that the volume of food was prepared. Waiter was very polite and apologetic about the slow service.  Fortunately we were not that hungry just very tired.  The food finally came; Portobello Mushroom Burger, Salad with Fried Chicken Skin (can't remember the name), Onion Rings and those Sweet Potato Fries again. Everything was just delicious. Now the Onion Rings are also my favorite any where, not over cooked like at so many restaurants and seasoned to perfection. When in Vegas enjoy this gourmet dinner style place for a great meal.",

I ordered the Patriot Burger, which was a turkey burger, smoked Gouda, spicy mayo, cherry compote(?) and crispy onions. DANG this burger was so good. I chose the turkey burger simply because it sounded healthier, but when I read all the dressings that came with it, it very quickly made my mouth water. And it did not disappoint. My friends ordered standard burgers like the kinds with eggs, avocado, or bacon. And they were upset. I mean, this is Gordon freaking Ramsay. You have a higher expectation!  But the Patriot Burger was amazingggg!   Because of the celebrity chef owner, the line here is long. You can put your name down and they'll text you when your table is ready. This basically means you have time to gamble in the casino, or shop around in the stores nearby.   Would I come back? Probably not, but if you find yourself dragged here get the Patriot Burger. It's the only one worth it on the menu.",

    "text": "First of all, I HATE the wait process for this restaurant. If you are a party of three or more, you can submit your name and phone number and be called back. However, if you are only a two top, you have to wait behind some rope and get called in one table at a time. I'm sure this is so a crowd develops and sparks interest but it's really annoying to feel trapped in this line. The wait time we were quoted was way off...and not in our favor. There's nowhere to sit. You can't explore the casino while you're waiting. You have to just stand in the line at their mercy. It would be better if you could at least make an Open Table reservation and the overflow had to wait outside to attract a crowd but this line is your only option. We waited at least 45 minutes at 9:00 on a weeknight!   Anyway...my other con to this restaurant is it kind of smells like a dirty rag at the entry way. Like that dirty bar smell that you sometimes encounter. I was SHOCKED by this two years ago when I first dined here and I was even more shocked that it still had this odor two years later. Very disappointing and it should be taken care of. Not up to Ramsay standards (that he prides himself in on TV) and his name is attached to this place.   It is VERY loud in this establishment. It's totally open to the casino at the front and back of the restaurant so you have restaurant noise, casino noise, bar noise, television noise, music...on this particular day I had a migraine so I was really overstimulated. If you want ambiance and a private conversation...this is not the place for you!   Our server was excellent. He noticed I wasn't feeling well. He sympathized with my migraine and even offered me Advil. He stooped down to our table to talk and take our order and I told him how much I valued his personality after our long day (we just returned from a 12 hour excursion). He was absolutely the star of this visit! He told us the burgers were running long and he would bring us our fries first. He was just so kind, attentive, efficient and great at his job. This establishment is lucky to have him and there should be more servers like him out there!   They don't have Heinz ketchup here. Only homemade ketchup. For me, this was a major flaw. I just don't like the homemade ketchup. It doesn't taste anything like the flavor I enjoy from Heinz. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was ok. It wasn't particularly flavorful which is surprising  considering how much stuff is on it (jalapeno, roasted tomato, avocado...) My mom got the backyard burger which she said was delicious. We split fries. If I was feeling better I would say we definitely could have gotten away with an order of fries per person. I love french fries and the orders aren't THAT big. If you love fries and don't like to share them...go with one order per person.   I wanted to love this place more than I do. My migraine, I'm sure contributed somewhat. They need to figure out that smell...and get some regular ketchup for those of us that prefer it. Stop forcing the homemade stuff on us! And please make Open Table available!",

    "text": "So, I totally love this place. Been here three times and will continue to come back when I'm in Vegas.   I reviewed GR Burgr when it was at the \"other location\" but it was lost on yelp due to the alleged relocation. However, the restaurant never moved, maybe they redecorated, but it's still at the same spot in the Planet Hollywood resort right off the strip.   Parking is a B! The PH parking is in the back of the resort and the attached miracle mile mall. It's a True workout to walk from the parking garage to the restaurant so you'll be good to chow down when you get there.   We ordered four burgers and three sides and three drinks bill was $126. Well worth the price. The burgers are always juicy and delicious. There are a bunch of different topping combinations on the menu to chose from.   My beef (lol) with them is (1) they exchanged the goat cheese off of the crown burger for a melty cheese which is still good but not the same, and, (2) the chips, or as we call them fries, are dry. Idk if that how they like them in England but I stick with the sweet potato fries and the onion rings for sides because both of them are awesome.  Even with these two beefs, it's still the BEST burger restaurant I've been to. If you're on the fence, just go.",

The line was around the corner to get in for dinner but we were able to get on a list and they called us. They said 45 min wait but it was much faster. We went and got a drink while we waiting in Planet Hollywood. I liked how they let us bring in our outside drinks to our tables, server even got us a glass to pour our beers into to match the restaurant atmosphere. We had two couples and shared two orders of delicious parmesan truffle fries. I split a 16$ burger with my wife that was really good.  Only unfortunate thing happened was when I got up to leave my pants got stuck to some gum on the chair. No fault to the restaurant but was not fun to try and get off. Server felt bad and hopefully changed the chair for the next guests.",

Try their truffle fries and Hell's Kitchen burger.  I'll also add, There are very few places that you notice how comfortable your seats are....this place has very comfortable seats.

A weird guy kept hovering, who wasn't our waiter, but rather than fill our drinks, he just gave the awkward look and kept moving. I made my husband stop him, finally because most of our glasses were empty.  I think Gordon forgot to heed his own advice because I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, because I like spicy. Well, if it says \"Hells Kitchen\", it  really should be spicy. Nope. The bun to burger ratio is sad. We named the buns Sir Mix A Lot buns, because baby got back. Too big for the tiny patty. Speaking of patty, where was it?!?! I thought it would be handmade and/or big and juicy. No, no and no! Such a disappointment! One and done. I pulled the top of the bun off, for the picture or you wouldn't be able to see anything.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsay for as long as I've been a foodie. We picked this place over the other GR restaurant because it was within our price range. It's located in Planet Hollywood and you're greeted by a line of fire with the words Gordon Ramsay Burger. The wait wasn't bad, the line moved pretty quickly but please note that if you have a party of more than 3 people, go to the front and tell the wait staff. We had a party of about 15 and we didn't see that sign until we were near the front so it was too late for that. Our wait was about an hour on a Monday night. I think if you have a smaller party, the wait should not be as long as ours. And reservations aren't available. The neat thing is you don't have to be there waiting until the hour is up, I was able to give them my number and they would text me when the table is clearing. We walked around outside and saw the Fountains at the Bellagio.  I ordered the Hell Kitchen's burger with the truffle fries. They warn you ahead of time to share the truffle fries with a couple of people so don't let the price deter you. This was probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. It definitely beats a few of my favorite burger joints in Dallas. It's also big so you'll be super satisfied. I split my burger with my friend who had the Farmhouse burger. The Farmhouse burger was interesting, wasn't my favorite exactly but it was still good. It had interesting toppings. The truffle fries were super flavorful. Every bite you took had good flavor. We were able to dip it in an aioli sauce and ketchup. The ketchup here is SUPER fresh, not packaged in a Hunt's ketchup bottle and you can definitely tell. I'm telling everyone who goes to Vegas to check this place out. Definitely worth your time and money.",

    "text": "For someone who's well known for being a great chef, this place really was Kitchen Nightmares. I was really disappointed from this place. For a restaurant with the word \"burger\" in its name, you would assume that they would have top notch burgers. Even with just \"Gordon Ramsey\" in the name of the restaurant, it should be top of the line food. But sadly it was all disappointing.   ~PARKING~ The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood and they have a huge parking structure that is free to park! It is pretty easy to find parking, but the parking structure is at the opposite side of where the restaurant is, so you have to walk through the whole mall.   ~FOOD~ I ordered the truffle fries, which I had high expectations for but they fell short. They were tough and tasted like they've been sitting on the side for hours. They were dried up and just difficult to chew. The dipping sauces that came with it were flavorful and unique, but I was not a huge fan of it. I think normal ketchup would have tasted better.   I also ordered the beer battered onion rings. These seemed more fresh than the fries. They were crunchy and tasted exactly like funions (if you've tried the chips before). It also came with two different dipping sauces and I loved the cheddar aioli sauce.   For my burger, I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with my patty cooked to medium. It was the most average tasting burger in my life. It tasted like a burger I could get at Red Robin's. It was bland and dry and it's supposed to have jalapeno inside, but I didn't get any spice in until my very last few bites of the burger.   ~FINAL CRITIC~ I honestly think that this place is all hype. I would not wait in line for this restaurant. It definitely is just an average tasting over priced burger. We also had to wait almost 40 minutes for our food to come out and they ran out of straws. Just a very disappointing restaurant overall.",

Ramsey Burger was nice combination of savory and spicy with jalapenos and cheese rounded off with thick avocado.   Sweet potato fries were a sweet and almost desert like with powered sugar and honey mayo dip.",

    "text": "3.5 stars Despite having been a life-long fan of Gordon Ramsay's TV shows like Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, and the F-Word, I've never actually visited one of his restaurants, so on my recent visit to Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Burger was the place to go! Located in Planet Hollywood, the place has a casual \"sports-bar\" vibe, along with an open kitchen, and there were people of all different ages and group sizes eating at this busy restaurant. We started our meal with the parmesan truffle fries, which came with a spiced ketchup and truffle aioli on the side. I didn't find the fries particularly special (there was a distinct lack of truffle aroma/flavor), but the truffle aioli was chock full of amazing umami unctuousness, though the ketchup was just dominated by sweetness.  And then what we came for--the burgers! The Hell's Kitchen burger was a must-order, and it came with melted asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, jalapeno aioli, and avocado. Plenty of fire and spiciness indeed (and the burger itself was nice and juicy), but otherwise, the flavors of the burger weren't all that interesting, and the bun turned out to be overly greasy with butter. I much preferred the Forest burger, which came with salty tremor cheese, forest mushrooms, arugula, and duck bacon. The flavors of this burger were very umami (thanks to the mushroom, cheese, and bacon), and the combination with the refreshing arugula worked very nicely! Again, however, the bun was way more greasy than necessary.  The burgers at Gordon Ramsay were good, but I can't say that they were the best I've had or necessarily worth the celebrity-chef price tag. I won't be in a rush to come back, but perhaps some of Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants in Vegas would be worth a try!",

If you're lucky you will get good food and good service but also is very capable of having the opposite which is sad considering it's Chef Ramsay's restaurant and you go with high expectations.   By now it's pretty obvious we had a bad experience this time. They changed their menu (for the worse). I was pretty sad they took out their delicious jalapeno poppers and other appies from their menu. After ordering we got our food super late and to top that I was served dirty and by dirty I mean filthy cutleries with god knows what was on it. Yikes! After complaining , never got an apology from the manager nor the manager came to our table even. My husband had to call him while he was busy talking to one of the servers then he gave us an employee discount . Ok thank you for that but really ?! Cmon Ramsay , you could do better than this ! If you were in my spot you would cuss and throw those flatware along with the burger at your staff !",

Sadly I wasn't able to take a photo of it but I had the Farmhouse burger. Now it didn't taste horrendous (I've had far worse), but this just didn't live up to its expectations. The bun didn't cut it for me. It tasted like it came straight out from a plastic container and they decided to brush some melted butter on it to mask the flavor.  The meat was also really dry. I didn't feel like I got my moneys worth. It was good that I experienced it, but so far all of Ramsays restaurants for me have been a hit or a miss and most of the time his appetizers are always killin it but when it comes down to the main course, it's nothing great.  To end on a brighter note, the nachos were excellent and the service was awesome!",

I was looking back at my pics from the trip and saw that delicious burger so I figured a review was a must.  I always remember a great experience.  We were walking through Planet Hollywood one afternoon and as we were passing by Gordon Ramsay Burger we noticed a bit of a line up to get in.  We decided to wait (it was only for 5 minutes) as the place looked like it was buzzing and had to give it a try.  We ended up getting kitchen seating which was like sitting along a bar with view of the kitchen.  It was cool as you were able too see everything from how all the food was getting prepared, cooked, plated and expedited.  I decided to order the Hog Burger which was made up of pork basted in maple butter, english sharp cheddar, crisp onions and slaw.  It was absolutely fantastic.  What a bad ass burger.  The combinations of flavours were unreal.  Our server was friendly, energetic and very attentive.  The restaurant was buzzing, the view of the kitchen was cool and the burger was fantastic.  Looking forward to my next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Once I booked my flight to Vegas I knew I had to make a stop at one of Gordon's restaurants on the Vegas Strip! I'm a huge lover of burgers and Mr. Ramsey so this seemed like the PERFECT restaurant to sink my teeth into on my trip. I'll be honest, because of many of the reviews on Yelp I was skeptical about this restaurant but still wanted to give it a try. Lots of the reviews called this place \"overrated\" \"overpriced\" and Yelpers expressed feelings of regret saying things like \"Definitely not worth the price\", which made me weary but all my worries disappeared once I sunk my teeth into that burger! I thought since I was eating at a Ramsey restaurant I should order something different than the usual burger combinations like a beef patty with tomato, lettuce and pickles or a beef patty with bacon and a fried egg. I ordered the popular specialty  \"Hog Burger\" after my server, Justin, mentioned it was one of the more noteworthy menu items (along with the \"Hell's Kitchen\" Burger) and got a taste of pure heaven! The patty itself is made to order (Oh yeah!) out of pork, cooked medium and topped with bacon, fried onion , bbq pork, crispy onion, slaw, white cheddar and pickles - The flavors were out of this world. The patty itself was huge thick, juicy and flavorful, definitely worth the price .  The Parmesan Truffle fries were delicious and so was the truffle aioli they came with. Portions for everything were great for the price. Service and atmosphere were also great!  My server Justin was great, all smiles and he gave awesome recommendations since it was my family and I's first time at the restaurant. Had our drinks filled always and checked up on us throughout the meal.  My experience here was nothing short of amazing and was a huge highlight on my trip to Vegas, the only way it could have been made better is if Gordon Ramsey had handed me my food himself.",

Perhaps the avocado took some time to pit and slice.   Rings were on point the beef patty was cooked perfectly.  Whatever the hell the recipe for those sauces are, they need to go bye bye. Chipotle ketchup is fucking horrible and they were out of a beer on tap that my buddy wanted.   Wait in line was only 15 mins. With all the burger places out there they could be doing it better.

RECOMMENDATION: if you're going with a small party or even another guest, I would recommend getting two different burgers and splitting them. There are so many delicious options to pass up on!   Truffle fries: a thicker cut fry sprinkled with parmesan cheese and comes with ketchup and another dipping sauce. (Perfect for sharing) They were perfectly cooked, meaning they weren't soggy or over cooked. The other dipping sauce had a touch of garlic to it which made the French fry experience that much better.   Blue cheeseburger: Holy mother of flavors. Comes with blue cheese and manchego, fig jam, cider vinegar reduction and spicy mayo. From the first bite to the last, there is an explosion of flavor. The sweetness of the fig jam compliments the savory of the two different cheeses while the heat of the mayo gives it that extra kick that you didn't even know you needed. This is by far one of the best burgers I've ever had.   Hell's Kitchen burger: more of a classic style burger with extra heat. We opted out of the roasted jalapenos but the jalapeno aioli was more than enough to bring the burger up a notch.",

The UK colors for the plates and napkins along with the colorful menu was a great touch. I can't decide what I liked better: the fries or the burger. The sweet potato fries were covered in sugar. I got my burger medium and it was so juicy and fresh. Our server was really engaging. He asked us where we were from, and we discussed football; go Fighting Irish! We really enjoyed the whole experience, and even though we were only in Las Vegas for the day, it was totally worth stopping there. The burgers are made to perfection, so don't expect fast-food service. Our server suggested having the fries come out first as an appetizer, which was a good idea because we were starving.",

For the burgers omfg it was juicy and so delicious worth the bucks. The truffle fries were very delicious as well. My boyfriend and I shared one because it was a lot of potatoes!

I like the cheese options...the 'basic' cheese on even the most basic burger is a nice Irish cheddar I like, and I had the triple cheeseburger which had a trio of fantastic cheeses. Despite being a tall burger, it did not slide apart, and was both beautiful to look at and delicious.  But the star of the show is the milkshakes. Take a milkshake, top it with a few inches of a flan/creme brulee custard, and then some whipped cream, and you've got a legendary dessert. Really amazing, and yes, very over-the-top.   I'm likely to return, if only for the milkshake. Cheers!",

It was just the right size and I ordered the lamb burger which had some faint Indian spices to it which I liked, not too overpowering. the buns were freshly baked right in front of us and just the  best ones I have had. Asked the server to get me a well cooked patty and got exactly that. I didn't add fries since wanted to try the shake. The brown butter Ice cream shake was very thick and yum but if you don't have a very large appetite , better find someone to share it with! Very heavy .. probably has the calories you need for an entire week. Will definitely be back when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Normally when hubby & I travel we'll dine at a steakhouse & initially planned on going to Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris until our son & his girlfriend convinced us otherwise to get burgers. So, why not? Our visit landed us here on a Wednesday evening about 4pm & we waited 5 minutes for a table. Appetizers looked amazing- especially their Cheddar Ale soup (which I really wanted to try $9) but- it didn't offer options for different portions. If there was a cup portion- I'd be all over it. Maybe next time. I really wanted to try Bangers & mash... but, kept scoping the menu til it caught my eye- Foie Burger!! How often do your tastebuds land on this?!  Foie burger: Foie gras spread; Chevre (goat milk cheese); frisee; port wine aioli. I had to cut this burger in half- not that it was some huge gigantic thing... but, I wanted to see how it was layered. I'm neurotic this way, pardon me.  Foie gras spread on both buns- optimum juices flowed beneath burger patty! It took me a quick one to realize what caught my tastebuds attention! It was the Chevre! I really don't like goat milk- but, it wasn't slathered thick at all.... and I was actually dealing with it well enough to eat every single bite of this burger! Super proud of myself.  The order of truffle parmesan fries comes w/ 2 condiments- ketchup w/ Tabasco sauce and truffle aioli (you'll see flakes of truffle). Servers were kind enough to bring the curry AND chipotle ketchup too! That curry ketchup blew my mind! So glad these fries are steak cut!  Since we were told Gordon Ramsay liked the Innes & Gunn oak aged ale- why not?! There are notes of vanilla and toffee! Whoa! This ale was delicious!!!",

The manager named Angel came to our table several times to check on us and made us feel at home. Funny and very nice young lad. Our server was amazing as well.

I opted for the Hells Kitchen burger and my husband had the Hog burger. When the food came, we got our Parmesan truffle fries (delicious!) and my HK burger, but they brought a Backyard Burger instead of the Hog. We have no idea if they sent it to the wrong table... but expecting no less from a Ramsay restaurant, they had to fire a new one, which finally came when I was almost done with my burger and we had already finished the fries. Our waiter apologized and let us know that they were taking the burger off the bill. The manager then came over to also express his apologies and explained the situation. He also offered us a free drink since our waiter had not offered one during the wait, so we opted for the caramel pecan milkshake (highly recommend). Management handled the situation extremely well and we would definitely come back.  My only improvements would be a greeting once you get to the front of the line..and our server could've been friendlier... but that's it!  *a photographer comes around taking your picture and will try to sell it in a cardboard frame for $10 FYI",

With the flame burner wall surrounding the restaurant give a modern bbq torch feel.  There was a wait to be seated but not super long for a Saturday night .  We opted for the bar seating to speed up the process because we were starving. *Good Beer Selection *interesting twist on Burger Combinations  Ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger was juicy excellent taste yummmmm!!!! Had onion rings that were amazing  And French fries came with different types of dipping sauces.  *Customer Service started of weak with the first bartender not having a good knowledge of the menu. Then a seasoned bartender took over and had that playful attitude made a fun experience.  Will be back for sure",

And me!!!! I ordered HOG BURGER which was little different because it is a pork burger! Had pulled pork+bacon+think pork patty +fried onion +slaw +pickle. Wow. It is like a perfect combination. To be honest I'm not a burger person so I didnt expect any. But it was super duper bomb. If there's no waiting then I can come back for this pork burger!!!",

This place has great service, amazing food, is reasonably priced, and is worth the wait. My only complaint is that they don't take reservations for parties with fewer than 14 people. Otherwise this place gets a 10/10 rating. Def worth a visit when you're in Vegas!",

I don't know how a burger with bacon, egg, and cheese on it can be bland, but they managed it.  The patty itself was seriously underseasoned, which makes for a sad burger.  The fries (thick wedge-style) were also completely devoid of any salt - we actually did send these back, because they were not tasty at all.  It wasn't a good burger, and definitely not worth waiting 40 minutes in line for.",

Since I had never been here before I said sure. Wait time was about 20 minutes which wasn't bad but what was bad was the wait time for our burgers. While the place was busy, there were 1-2 tables around us that didn't have anyone so it wasn't that busy. Luckily we started with the sweet potato fries which were decent. We waited about 40 minutes for our burgers. Then on top of that ridiculous wait, the avocado my boyfriend got (we put them on the side for me to be able to put on my burger), was nasty as you can see in the picture. Again if it was super packed/ busy I'd be understanding but like I said tables were empty and putting out avocado like that is nasty. Overall decor was nice, the big fluffy chairs were a plus but this isn't a place I'm going to flock to. If it was like that when it wasn't super busy, I can only imagine when it is busy. A bit disappointing.",

We both had the Ultimate Cheeseburger, add bacon. I ordered my burger medium well, wife ordered hers well. Mine was delivered well done (no pink) and hers was well over. (- 1/2 star) Still tasted great but given how busy we were and that we had already waited 45 minutes, we didn't send them back. Service was good, just took a while due to them being so busy (as we went on a Saturday night). We had our Diamond Celebration Dinner certificate, which you don't get change for of you don't use it all, so we had the appetizer, one soda, two milkshakes, two burgers (add bacon) and the truffle fries and the bill came to $92 with tax. When I asked if they could put my tip on my Caesars credit card, I was told that once the voucher was used on the bill, they couldn't ring up anything else on the ticket. I asked if they could charge me for a water to go or ring up a misc charge so that I could then give the waiter his tip on top of a separate ticket, he said no, that's against policy and I had to tip in cash. (- 1/2 star)   Also, if you have status with Caesars, the signs say to present your card for priority seating, but the placement of the sign is at the end of the long line of peoplewho have already been standing there for an hour.. You're supposed to go straight to the hostess station, present your Platinum, Diamond or Seven Seas card and they seated us within 3 minutes of us cutting the line ;-) well definitely go back, in spite of the cooking temp issues. I'll ask for medium instead of med-well.",

Attentive waiter and servers, very friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant is chill, comfy chairs, big tables, and great decor. The food, well, best burger I've had all year! Juicy, fresh, looking gorgeous, and delicious! I got the Hells Kitchen burger and it was outstanding! Also, they have the best onion rings I've ever had. No competition. Get them and you'll see what I mean. Their fries were ok but their dipping sauces are quite memorable, tasty stuff! Highly recommended and can't wait to go back!",

I chose flatbread. By the time I got my hot dog, though, everyone else had finished eating, and the hot dog was just a normal hot dog.

If you are a party of 2 you get to wait in a line and 3 or more you put in a reservation and get a text when your ready. So I waited in line for 30 mins even though they quoted 15 and the line was short. It goes REALLY slow. So I'm watching a bunch of larger parties getting seated before me.  When I complain about this to the overstaffed hostess stand, they explain that they have way more two top tables. This is a flat out LIE because they put many of them together to accommodate larger parties. Then after waiting a half hour, they break down a large table at the front with the sun blaring in to make four 2-top tables and offer it to us, after I complained about the wait and larger parties going before us. The four hostesses that were working didn't have enough sense to skip that question. You would think that between the four of them, that was a bad offer. Then they went down the line to offer that.  So then we order the signature burger, but are told no substitutions. Come on Ramsey, don't be like that. Let us take off the lettuce, especially since they are little pieces.   I will admit tho, the signature burger (once we removed the lettuce ourselves) was delicious. Short ribs with rib eye, and pickled onions were to die for!!!!! The farmhouse burger was also really good.",

    "text": "This restaurant ruined my experience in Vegas. My family and I heard of this restaurant and were told it was one of the best. When we went to eat we started off with a 50 minute line. Once we got to the cashier we were told that we would have to wait another hour and a half. After waiting for so long we just wanted some water. There was a bar right next to the cashier with a Gordon Ramsay background so we asked for water. Surprisingly the person who worked there needed an ID to give us water so my aunt showed an ID and she said that she would not give us the water until we back away from the bar, so we did. Once the table was ready we went in and ordered drinks and food. I never knew I would enjoy the drink more than the food. We ordered 3 hamburgers, 2 regular and one with no onions and to add mushrooms. We ended up getting 3 regular ones which one contained a long piece of hair which couldn't have been ours for sure and another with no mushrooms and with onions. We politely told the waitress that the order was wrong and that there are no mushrooms. She then started raising her voice saying she \"sees the mushrooms inside\" and we opened up the burger showing her there are none. The waitress kept saying we were wrong and wouldn't ask if she could do anything to help. We then asked her so please call the manager so we can figure this out. She started yelling at our table in front of everyone saying \"your so rude no costumer ever talked to me Like that\" as if we did something wrong. The manager came and heard us out and in the middle she started shaming us on how it's our fault for not being \"clear.\" He then told her not to talk or go near us but that didn't stop her from cussing out every one of us every time she would walk by. We walked out of there not wanting to ever go back even if the meals were free.",

    "text": "We were looking forward to trying this place so I hate giving it two stars but the burger and fries just weren't good. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and my husband got the Blue Cheeseburger. The patties were cooked well but there was NO flavor. It tasted like an unseasoned mash of beef and avocados. If I didn't know that there were jalapenos in there, I would never have been able to guess. I had to asked for ketchup and slathered mine in it to finish it. My husband tried mine and said his was only slightly better. I didn't try his since I don't like blue cheese so it wouldn't have been a fair assessment. The fries were the same consistency throughout, no texture on the outside. They were just slightly limp cuts of potato. The only saver of the night were the onion rings. Now those were THE BEST onion rings of my life, and I don't typically go for them. The servers were great so with that and the onion rings, I think two stars is fair. WAH, I so wish I would give a better review but that only comes with a better burger.",

    "text": "We came here for a Sunday dinner, and as it was the week-end, a wait was expected.  The line actually moved fairly quickly, so it wasn't too bad. After being seated, our waitress came, and she was quite friendly.  It took about 30 minutes before we got our food - longer wait than we expected. It seemed there was a hold-up of some sort in the kitchen though because once the food started coming out, a lot of food was coming out. We had onion rings for appetizer, and it was delicious. The batter was light and crispy, and the sauces were very good.   My husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium rare, and he really enjoyed it.  I was a bit boring and got the ultimate cheeseburger, medium well (since I'm pregnant and shouldn't eat anything too rare). The waitress asked if I wanted any toppings for my burger, and among other things, I requested extra pickles on my burger. When the burgers came out, it was obvious to me that the waitress wrote down that I asked for \"extra\" pickles because my burger was loaded with pickles - a good sign that she listened, and the chefs made the food as ordered. While I wished I would have ordered my burger medium, it was still quite good. The cheese flavor was quite strong, but overall, a very good burger.  Perhaps it's because I'm pregnant, but the sweet pickles were delicious - I had to ask for an extra side of pickles and actually finished all of that too. The burger was quite large for me, and after eating half of the burger, I took the buns off the other half so I can finish my dinner without overstuffing myself.  Overall, great place.  If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back.",

    "text": "Definitely paying for the name here.  Extremely expensive and food was very disappointing.  It wasn't bad, but you have high expectations for Ramsay and the burger and fries were nothing out of the ordinary & not worth the price.  My husband and I both ordered fries because we wanted two different types.  The waitress asked if we wanted two servings, but didn't tell us that she was asking because each serving can probably feed 4 people.  Had we known that, we would have ordered only 1, especially after getting the bill and finding out the the fries were $8 & $11 each.  We had the truffle parmesan fries and regular fries, and there was not much taste difference.  They also come with different sauces, which we really didn't like.  I had the backyard burger.  Good, but not great.  My husband had the farmhouse burger, which was a mess.  It comes with a \"fried egg\" but it was just oozing egg yolk as he tried to eat it.  The restaurant is actually very small, and is placed at the entrance to a mall area, with two sides of the restaurant open to the shops, making it feel like a fancy food court.  I was really looking forward to this and was let down.",

However I was a bit disappointed to find that this place didn't even crack my list of top burger places in America. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just lacking the pizazz or special ingredient that it needed to take it to the next level. It didn't have as much of a kick as I had hoped for and I thought the bun that they used was definitely lacking and could've been upgraded. Then there are the truffle fries. These are the biggest waste of money ever! They are more expensive than the burger and have very little truffle taste if any. They are also cut so thick they are essentially wedges. I prefer my truffle fries thin shoe strings. If anything, I'd recommend saving your money and just going with the burger when you come here unless you have a big group and would like to share the fries otherwise it just isn't worth it.",

Our French fries took awhile to come out (they forgot about it) I then asked our waiter about the fries, he brings them out, took a bite out of it, It was under Fried. Some of them were cold. If I thought mc Donald's fries were better then something is wrong. I should just have ordered onion rings. The wings was good, the only bad experience I had was the fries. Therefore, this place was awesome, however, do not order the FRIES, anything else you can order but not the FRIES.",

I then asked what he thought was the best burger.  TURDUCKEN BURGER it was.  Watching the kitchen prepare delicious plates was amazing. Everything coming out of that kitchen was picture perfect. Amazing Show. The sous chef ran the pass and was in complete control of everything that was presented.  Now to the burger.  With the first cut the perfectly runny yolk ran down the burger.  The mix of flavors with the turkey chopped burger with duck confit was amazing.  The bun was grilled to perfection. Service was wonderful and I normally do not finish an entire burger.... this one was finished. Gotta love Vegas. Gordon Ramsey did not disappoint.",

The portobello mushroom burger amazed me again and again, the burger was with lots of layers that I've never thought of a burger can be. The truffle fried was also a great choice, it came with two sauce, one is truffle mustard (maybe, not sure), the other red sauce is made of fresh tomato and some other ingredients that we couldn't figure out. But both sauces and fries itself were delicious!",

I've had better poutine from a Canadian Costco. Burger was majorly over cooked (ordered medium rare, got well done). Cheese looks and tastes like Kraft singles. For a man who has a show called \"Hells Kitchen\", the food here certainly came directly from hell. And I love Gordon! But the quality of food here is just atrocious. And there was cheese on the bill folder and brown crust on a \"fresh\" served plate. and it's basically a sports bar atmosphere. Step it up Ramsay!",

    "text": "I along with a couple friends thought we would try this restaurant back in March. Fortunately the wait during a busy weekend was not to bad, about fifteen minutes. Once we were seated the waiter approached the table and promptly asked if we wold like to order anything to drink. We chose not to order any alcohol and simply ordered waters and soft drinks. It was very obvious from the waiters demeanor that since we did not order any alcohol this was going a low ticket table and assumed his tip would reflect that. Never assume! The burgers were about average, good but nothing to rave about.   The little things are what made the difference. When our burgers were brought to the table they came in stages, not all together. Once we received the burgers it took about ten additional minutes for the fries to arrive. Why is the table not served together? Toward the end of the meal one of my friends finished his burger before the rest of us. His plate was clear while we were still eating. Is this common practice to start clearing the table before all the patrons are still eating. It made us feel as though they were trying to push us out the door quickly so they can get the next party seated asap. Maybe they were going to order alcohol to jack up the tab.  Overall, our expectations were much higher and under delivered from a Gordon Ramsay establishment. I've eaten at Chef Ramsay's restaurant in London a few times and always received exceptional service. I know you can't really compare fine dinning to burgers but some sort of consistency would be great.",

When I asked him what's good in the menu, he said he's never eaten the food so he has no clue what to suggest. Service was slow and food came out maybe 30 minutes later. Paying the check also took a long time. Apart from the really bad service - the burger tasted good. But take note that the burger costs around $15-20 and didn't come with any sides, that's an additional $9-12. The truffle fries was pretty ordinary l, but the onion rings were much tastier.",

I've gotten a lot of items on the menu but my favorite dishes would have to be the Hell's Kitchen burger and wings.  The burger is cooked perfectly to your specifications and doesn't come soggy like most places. The bun is crisp and goes really well.   I asked for the wings to be cooked extra crispy and naked and they came out perfectly. I recommend doing it this way so the wings aren't soggy because if the sauce is on the wings too long it'll happen.  In conclusion if your staying at Planet Hollywood do yourself a favor and come here. You won't regret it.",
