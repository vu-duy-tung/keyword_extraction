Would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for a good meal for a good price. Will come back.",

The people in line lined up in front of our table as we're eating and it was awful not to mention the food was less than average . Bad food and not so good service at register.  Two of the three sanwiches were made in incorrectly and the other was just greese soaked  meat and way too much juice! It was so sloppy she red regarded it.

The coffee is standard truck driver brew (strong&dark) and the omelette was pretty standard however I wish they would cook down the peppers and onions a little that way you don't get that raw bite when your munching down.

This was obviously a mistake on the kitchens part because the Strawberry Nutella pancakes are one of their signature dishes and they just put strawberries on it and put no Nutella so this is obviously an issue with Munch Box, my receipt was listed correctly on my order and I did pay extra for these items and I was told to contact the third-party delivery service that had nothing to do with filling the kitchen order correctly to ask for a refund this is terrible customer service and honestly you're just plain robbery. When I asked to speak to the manager of the girl told me his name is Avo and then hung up on me.

The woman who took my order was extremely helpful in my decision-making process which is really nice because most of the time people will just stand there and wait for you to make a choice. I told her that I wasn't really feeling meat so she was like ok how about we add some avocado instead which is exactly what I wanted hear!  She was so nice and checked in on me frequently even though it was a pay first then sit down kind of place. Then I got my food in a timely fashion, and it was just delicious for a simple as it was, it was really delicious. The chef also came and checked on me which I appreciated.   I would say the only negative I have is that they give out plastic forks and knives, which is fine...but I had French toast and it was hard to cut through and I feel like I was almost going to break the knife at times.

The bacon was decent but fatty and the French toast had zero flavor. The home fries were the best thing I had and I'm not usually a fan of them. I had a couple bites of everything and left the rest.

    "text": "In short: Come for the awesome poutine, stay for the well-priced sandwiches.   The poutine is served just like it should be: hot skin-on fries with tons of cheese curd nuggets and a gravy bath. You can add pork to make it meaty and the portion is huge for sharing.   As for sandwiches, the Lox Bagel is under $8 and comparable to pricier versions across the Vegas valley. Pick your bagel (Everything!), and I recommend adding extra onion for crunch.  Bonus points for friendly service and a Yelp check-in offer for a free drink. Tijuana Hot, I'll see you next time!",

The service is great. It feels comfortable enough to dine inside.   The food is delicious with generous portions. I am very happy they serve POUTINE. As a Canadian, I approve of their dish. It's delicious and they did not skimp on any ingredient. The gravy is delicious, the cheese is gooey and perfect poutine cheese. The fries are soggy due to the toppings and this is the poutine test. Dry crispy fries means not enough toppings. Soggy means....DIG IN! This is what brought me here in the first place! But I've sampled other menu items and am definitely impressed.   The one item I was disappointed in was the grilled cheese. It was OK, but I suspect it contained processed cheddar slices. Meh.",

    "text": "The other week I was looking to have a sandwich for lunch. And although there are lots to choose from, I wanted a non-franchise sandwich shop to go to. Unfortunately, the first time around, I couldn't find Munch Box. However, as I had to stop at CVS, I saw Munch Box in the shopping plaza across the street. Lucky I found it so that I could try it today.  Parking spaces immediately in front of the restaurant is for 20-minutes only. However, parking for an early lunch isn't too bad.  As I parked and made my way to Munch Box, I had to walk past Subway. Weird that they're next door to each other.  They have many good options, but I decided on the chicken club for today. As a few other patrons followed, they ordered breakfast.  While waiting for my meal, I went to the restroom. Although the restaurant seems to be clean, the restroom felt filthy. Unfortunately, that somewhat ruins it for me because it makes me wonder about the rest of the restaurant, the stuff we don't see.  It has been a while since I've had my favorite sandwich. So the top portion of Chicken Club sandwich had a slightly overcooked thin chicken breast with bacon, a slice of toasted bread and the lettuce and tomato on the bottom.  All in all, it was just okay.  Although I ordered first, the other table got their breakfast first, it's just easier to make. And of course, they finished before I did.  The waitress asked the young man how he liked his meal, and he said, \"it was soooo good.\" And rubbed his tummy to indicate he was full.  While he and his buddy were leaving, a few high schoolers, with Justin Beiber haircuts walked by. One of them saying, \"this place is FIRE!\" So i'm assuming that he meant it was hot, like super good kind of hot.  All-in-all I'll have to give this visit 3-stars for an ok sandwich, ok ambience, filthy restroom, nice employees.",

And my husband got the chicken sandwich that he literally won't stop talking about and we went in there days ago. He said \"best chicken sandwich ever\" and he is basically a chicken sandwich connoisseur. Staff was great, super friendly and helpful. Service was quick and this place is definitely poppin.

I like mushrooms but it just didn't seem to pair well with the other flavors.   The power greens salad was a nice mix of greens, a couple slices of avocado, cherry tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts and walnuts. The chicken (which was $3.50 extra) was served on the side in a separate container.   Maybe the breakfast is better, but I thought Munch Box was very average.

So when the delivery came we were a bit disappointed of the things that we received cuz it wasn't quite what we ordered. I called the restaurant to let them know that the order was done wrong and how the app had mentioned different things that are on the app but I didn't received in the order, So the manager or whoever it was that I spoke to was very nice and they said that they would comp the order. I'm giving this rating because the service I received over the phone was very good.  Now the food on the other hand that is something that I probably might not want to order again. We had ordered the southwestern omelet and the munch Box breakfast and chicken tenders and fries for our little one.  I really can't say much for the Munch Box breakfast cuz that was the one that was ordered wrong it came in as a sandwich so we just picked it out from the bread and just ate the innards of the sandwich you know the eggs the sausage and that was pretty much it. The omelette was good but was hoping that they had the side of fresh fruit salad rather than the home fries that I received. Again since the app was not able for me to choose on home fries or fresh fruit the website stated supposed to come with fresh fruit however when I received it it came with the home fries. The home fries we got just was full of spices that's all you could taste just spice couldn't even really taste the potatoes much. So that was really disappointing.  The staff is great. They did right by crediting back the orders that was wrong. I would go back to eat there again, but I think we'll explore the other options on the menu.",

We got two sandwiches, two drinks, and a side of hashbrowns that was just a thin potato patty ($2 extra!) for $36. It was insanely expensive for what we received.   Neither of us liked our meals. I got the salmon, onion, cream cheese, caper bagel sandwich. Everything about it was clunky. The onions were cut too large, the salmon was not the highest quality and it was also cut into huge pieces. They use a heavy cream cheese instead of a nice light whipped cream cheese that was spread so I thick, I had to take some off.  Not one ingredient in that sandwich was of high-quality and everything kept falling off. It was like a teenager with no food prep skills was in the kitchen that day.  I saw the two people making food that day...and they weren't teenagers.  Not to be mean, but their name on that day could've been 'clunk box.' The pictures on their menu are much better looking than what they're actually serving. I'm giving two stars for the location and the cashier who was incredibly friendly, helpful, and bubbly.",

There's always a line, so that has to say something, if anything that was a good sign to me and it moves quickly. It's in the corner of the Smith's shopping center on Eastern and Horizon Ridge Parkway, sandwiched between Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and Subway, right next to BR 31 Flavors.

If you check in they'll give you a cup of good, dark coffee on them. That's just the icing on the cake, as their breakfast sandwiches are that much better then the next best place.

I typically order between two items on the menu, and some of the employees remember the sauce that I always ask for. I used to order their chicken tenders here and I like that it isn't overly breaded at all. My current favorite is the Philly chicken cheesesteak which I highly recommend. I've never gotten breakfast food here yet but I will definitely give them a try sooner than later.",

I ordered the Lox & Bagel as well.   Over the phone I had said that I would figure a coffee and OJ when I got there...  I walked in about 8 minutes later and my food was all ready in a bag. There was a cup for coffee and a glass of the freshest and most delicious OJ. She was so sweet. Talked to me about my life and shared that it was her place with her brothers... so rad!!  Loved the food. Will be back soon. Thankful to have found this gem!",

I'm glad we finally made our way into Munch Box.  There is a giant menu board on one wall of the restaurant so it's easy to see all of the menu options and make a selection. The woman that took our order was very friendly and warm. She even checked in on us after we had our food to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The restaurant is small inside with only five or six tables, but it seemed to be working out that a table was always available as needed. Pricing was really reasonable and I would consider this an inexpensive lunch option.   The menu had many enticing options, but the Poutine Burger on the specials board is what ultimately caught my attention. I was warned that it would take 7-8 minutes to prepare because it's made fresh. This was no problem at all and I appreciate that the food is prepared fresh here. The burger was very delicious and the poutine on top was really good. The fries in the poutine had a great flavor and the gravy was really good. I went with a salad as my side option and it came with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. My husband had the Turkey Grilled Cheese. He thought it was good, but he would probably try something more exciting next time.  Overall, Munch Box has delicious food and friendly service at a reasonable price. We'll be back!",

It was a Sunday morning, around 1030, and we had a party of 6. Our original plan was Egg Works but upon pulling into the parking, it was clear that we'd have to wait and my kids were not going to be able to wait any longer.  I called two other places, Munchbox was the third and the winner! They said there was no wait and they were about three minutes away! We zipped right over.  The store was clean, with a soda fountain, and drink station in one corner and a very attractive menu board next to the counter. The Poutine was calling my husband and his BFF so they split that and a pastrami San. They praised both. In fact the staff couldn't say which San was the better of the two. Btw, the staff and cooks were very friendly! Yep, you can talk to the cooks, and watch them whip up your meals too! I'm a sucker for bagels and for anything lox...so it was only natural for me to get the traditional lox, it had a bit too much cream cheese, but I usually tell people light on the cheese and forgot to do it this time. Our other friend ordered some egg white scramble with veggies and a side of fruit, it looked delicious, and she mentioned that it was. We both agreed that we need to order the scrumptious looking salad pictured on the menu. So we'll have to be back.  It's not a type of place that'll seat you but, the girl who helped us saw that we were eating in and she politely set up a table for the six of us! Oh and the coffee, and fountain drinks are refillable.",

I got the egg and  cheddar cheese sandwich on whole wheat and it was out in less than 5 minutes - the bread was toasted just right and the egg was scrambled. Yummy! Oh and I got the freshly squeezed OJ too.   My hubby got the Philly cheesesteak and that thing was enormous! I got to have a bite and everything was Delish! Bread was fresh and soft. The meat was cooked and seasoned nicely. It came with a side salad which looked fresh and tasty too. This was off the lunch menu and came with a soda.  Note: this is an all day Breakfast and Lunch place! So good to know!   And this is a family owned business - so support Local!  (and I believe this is their 2nd location here on Eastern Avenue!)   Overall a great clean and cool place to eat in or take out!  And how could I forget.... super friendly staff!!",

I ordered the veggie burger munch box with fruits. The veggie burger itself was very flavorful, it was a black bean patty with quinoa. It came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and hummus to add more flavor. The burger itself was huge and didn't end up finishing the entire thing.  My boyfriend got the Denver omelette with hash brown & toast. The omelette was good and wasn't oily compared to some diners.   Staff is very friendly and accommodating to their customers even though it's not a sit down restaurant.   Next time I will be back for breakfast and make my own breakfast sandwich!",

It comes with two types of cheese (cheddar and jalapeno cream cheese) as well.  I really like cheese but it sounded like a bit too much so I opted to do my sandwich without the cheddar cheese.  The cream cheese had a good amount of jalapenos mixed in so it gave my sandwich a nice kick to it without adding any hot sauce.  I also opted to get a hash brown on the side to round out my meal.  My buddy had their Philly cheesesteak and he really liked it along with their fresh cut fries.  Great place all around with fantastic customer service.",

    "text": "Munch Box is in the former Henderson bakery location, and I'm glad to see the changes they've made to the place. They kept some of the menu items I used to like, but added options and items that take it out of the \"breakfast only\" category and make it a go-to lunch place now, too. There's a great energy in there, and the owners are clearly focused on making sure the customer gets what they want, how they want it. I've been looking for months for a place with Poutine, and it was excellent. Fries were perfectly browned and fresh cut, with chunks of real (not frozen, breaded/fried) cheese curd generously spread on top, covered in a rich brown gravy that strikes the right balance between savory and salty with onion notes. I have to imagine if you're Canadian this is going to be closer to home than the americanized versions that other places try to replicate.  I've been here three times for the breakfast bagels since the new owners took over and I've FINALLY found a place that goes out of the way to make the customer happy. See, I like over-easy yolks on my bagel sandwiches. This is the ONLY place in Henderson I've found that will actually do that properly! Einsteins has been advertising their \"fresh cracked eggs\" but it's still just a microwaved (blech) egg. This place grills everything to order and has gotten it perfect each time. Excellent service and affordable. I'm going to go back next week to try the cheesesteak.",

Done the traditional way with raw-cut fries, cheese curds, and delicious brown gravy.   You can build your breakfast sandwich and I recommend the croissant as a bread, it's super buttery and flaky. I opted for egg whites, spinach, and mushrooms with Swiss cheese. All of the veggies were fresh and not canned! A plus! The Tijuana Hot was also ordered and full of heat. Free coffees were offered with our order, a nice touch. The service was so friendly and efficient at Munchbox, and food delivered to table even though it's counter service. Definitely a spot for quick, inexpensive, and fresh brekkie! Yum!",

My husband and I often look up businesses on Yelp and then go on little exploration adventures that take us all over the place. Lately, we keep finding ourselves venturing out to Henderson a lot because there are so many great spots out that way and one of those great spots is Munch Box.  The cashier was very friendly and walked us through all the ordering options. I opted to build my own breakfast burrito and my husband had the Tijuana bagel. Everything came out piping hot and the ingredients were all fresh. We even shared a side of poutine. The owners are from Montreal which explains the poutine and French radio station playing on the speakers. I love poutine and can never resist it so I was a happy camper to see it on the menu.  Their coffee was really good and they had a great variety of tea options as well. I also appreciated that they offered flavored coffee creamers and a few different hot sauce options.  The Munch box offers breakfast and lunch and there are so many options we'll have to keep coming back to try more items like the Bialy, love those. Actually they cater too so we may have to cater a family event to get to try more of their offerings.",

We ordered the Dirty Bird, a spicy spin on chicken and waffles - amazing. The poutine fries includes a savory gravy, delicious cheese curds and perfect french fries, with the skin on(!). And the ultimate hangover cure: the Munch Box Ultimate, which is a customized breakfast sandwich (go with the hash brown instead of the veggie option for max flavor and fattness). The menu can be a little confusing when you customize, but the staff is super friendly and will break it down for you. This is NOT some greasy spoon, the quality ingredients and attention to detail elevates dishes like the Dirty Bird to pinky raising levels. At the same time it's not pretentious, it's just good food made with care and very generous portions. The atmosphere is chill, friendly. We took ours to go, but I could see stopping in for lunch. It's a small space, maybe not great for a large brunch party...though they do offer breakfast platters for groups and epic dishes that beg to be shared like The Everest Pancakes and The Wafflestein. Bottom line: Munch Box is quality, hearty and delicious. Why are you still reading this? Go now.",

They came with organic maple syrup.  It was absolute heaven. They even tossed in a complementary fountain drink.   The people who work there are super nice as well, and the place was very clean.    Highly recommend and will be back with friends!",

I was worried about the food being soggy or cold because to-go orders from most places typically don't turn out to be as good as if you were to dine-in. However, the order from Munch Box was still hot, my bacon was still crispy, and overall tasted just as fresh when I finally made it to my destination to eat it. The food was seasoned wonderfully. It's really hard to find good restaurants that make good pancakes, but Munch Box has definitely exceeded expectations in that area with their buttery fluffy amazingly tasting pancakes. I highly recommend the Munch Box!!!!!",

The traditional lox was good.  Nothing to write home about.  I wish though that they would have toasted the bagel.  It would have been much better.  Also a bit more red onion for crunch would have been nice as well.  The poutine fries were excellent.  Cheese curds, gravy, fries... so good.  One suggestion for the owners... You need to vacuum the bottom of that bagel case.  Its kinda gross with all the crumbs and stuff that fall to the bottom.  Other than that a great spot for a decent breakfast.",

However,  when I received my order, several items were missing, which I had paid and was deducted from my account. Post mates can only refund $5.00. Which is there normal missing items refund amount. So I called Munch box to let them know my order was incorrect and missing food that I had paid for. The guy that picked up the phone at munch box was not helpful and useless. Point is, Postmates places the order. And munch box gets the order. So munch box is responsible in getting the order CORRECT. You are ripping off your customers this way!!.  So today 2/24/19, I've decided to give munch box another shot. Screenshot what I order and paid for, and guess what, again... another repeat of items missing.  So now I called munbox spoke to a female, she had nothing to say but \"ok\", no apologies nothing. I asked to speak to the manager, she stated she was busy. She will have manager return my call ... waited and NO PHONE CALL FROM THE MANAGER!!   The owner should look into the people that looks at the order and hold people accountable for their poor customer service!!!",

I love they make you feel in here, it's like a small town local breakfast restarting where everyone knows you. Everyone was so friendly and awesome. On top of the great service the food was delicious. I ordered the breakfast plate with eggs, turkey sausage, hash browns for the side and pancakes. I loved it all. Pancakes tasted like they were made from scratch, the turkey sausage was so flavorful, tasted like a regular sausage. The bf ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant fully loaded, he loved it. We also took advantage of the free coffee with a yelp check in, coffee was fresh and delicious. I love the hot sauce variety they have as well. I found my new favorite sauce this way",

This amazing little slice of heaven is in a strip mall and can't easily be seen from the street. We arrived about 12:30ish and the place was kind of quiet. The menu is on 4 tv monitors mounted on the wall and it is quite extensive. They have everything from pancakes to cheese steak sandwiches. My eyes zeroed in on the Munch Box Poutine Burger.   So imagine this. A beef patty, topped grilled onion, fried egg, bacon, cheese, french fries, and poutine gravy. Then topped with a brioche bun. As you can imagine, you can't pick it up to eat it. As a side, I had french fries.  The staff is very friendly. Munch Box is a family run operation from what I understand and the family is French Canadian. So it is great to get poutine from people who know what they are doing. Pricing is VERY reasonable. Parking is ample. Munch Box shares the parking lot with Smith's and Winchell's(The bar, not the doughnut shop.)   Munch Box is another great culinary gem in the evolving food scene in Henderson. So get off the Strip and give it a try.",

I've always seen the Munchbox on Snapchat and Instagram stories, but never made my way over despite living down the street; however, I'm glad that Yelp lead us here today. For being a Tuesday afternoon, there was a decent crowd. Regardless of that, the cashier was fast to greet us and to take our order. He was also patient and informative about menu items. I ordered the Munch Box Ultimate with cheddar bagel, American cheese, and turkey and my boyfriend ordered the Poutine burger. Suffice to say, we were not expecting the size of either sandwiches when we got home. It was so savory and delicious though. Every bite was full of flavor. On top of that, the location is convenient and in the Smith's shopping center on Eastern and Horizon Ridge. I would highly recommend coming here for lunch!",

The vegan burger was fresh and good and tasted absolutely nothing like a burger. Which in my opinion is a good thing since I personally don't like the taste of meat.

I got a delicious Denver omelette and some fresh fruit. Hubby got pancakes that were ginormous and came with a tower of sausage and potatoes. We all want to come back and try the different breakfast sandwiches they have.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place after reading the reviews...my everything bagel tasted like a plain regular bagel and the onion cream cheese had no onion flavor. My egg was waaay overcooked, brown and crispy with a skin that could be peeled off and the yolks were cooked separate from the egg white - like flat little yellow patties and placed on top of the browned egg whites. How and why were the yolks cooked separately, and if you messed up cooking the egg why serve it like that, make a new one?!? Unfortunately it was an order to go so I didn't see this until at home. Maybe it was an off day for them, I hope so :(",

I probably won't eat there again, unless they can be more clean. Too bad cause I like their bagel sandwiches. The coffee is good and strong reminded me of truck stop coffee.

They have lots of choices for bread/bagels.  The man that handled our order was the nicest guy ever.  He offered to give my husband an extra choice of cheese since he chose not to get meat on his breakfast sandwich (vegetarian).  They honored the 'free coffee when you check in with yelp' coupon.  My one and only complaint is that they don't make decaf coffee (I can't have caffeine), but there is a coffee bean right next door, so my husband got the free coffee and got me a decaf from next door.  He got the make your own breakfast sandwich for $6, choosing jalapeno cheese bagel for bread, and added fries for $2.  I got the turkey avocado grilled cheese with 'Mom's fries.'  I am so coming back here!",

If your unfamiliar with cheese paper, its that melted, crusty stuff stuck to the wrapper of your meal that i must scrape off and eat before my actual food. I meant to take a photo of my delicious sandwich but it was too messy/good to stop and capture. This is a great budget option for a quick lunch, especially for those that like breakfast all day. I grabbed the Tijuana on a jalapeno bagel and sausage and out the door in less than 5 minutes. The sandwich was a little heavy on this white sauce (could have been mayo) but aside from that i was happy. A melty mess of eggs, sausage and cheese is never something to complain about. And for $5.99 + tax, that's not terrible.",

For an added upcharge, you can add pork tenderloin in it too if you want some protein to go with your carbs and dairy. I decided not to. The portion size of the Poutine was a good size for the price. They also offer bagel sandwiches and omelettes. A good crowd was already in there when I walked in. Customer service was friendly and kept the line moving. While waiting for my carb adventure, I had the chance to look over the menu to see if there was something else for future breakfast options. Although there was, the price for the bagel sandwiches and the kid's menu seemed kinda high. They offer pancakes with a side of Baskin Robbins ice cream for one of their kid's option. Not my personal favorite option for kids, but to each their own. Might come back to try some if their other items, but I think the Poutine would be the item worth recommending to come and check this place out.",

    "text": "Lovely place for breakfast/lunch with a surprisingly large menu. My only demerit isn't for the restaurant but for the idiots in the parking lot. Luckily, this particular batch isn't likely to be all there at the same time again.  The restaurant is located on the outskirts of a Smith's parking lot, and I've always noticed that Smith's has the worst parking lots.  Inside, the restaurant was clean and everyone was friendly. We placed our order, paid, and sat down for a short wait.  Firstly, I got their hand squeezed orange juice. It's a bit pricy but OMG, so good! Hubby had a taste and immediately regretted his choice of tea instead.  Hubby got a burger and fries, and he loved both. The burger was thick and meaty, perfectly cooked, and more than enough for his larger appetite. The fries didn't look great, but surprisingly were good. I'm more of a skinny fries fan, but these were sturdy and I didn't miss that they serve poutine - these looked perfect for poutine.  I got a plain bagel with scrambled eggs, ham & cheese. The bagel was fresh and properly toothsome, and the ingredients were excellent and plentiful. I couldn't eat even half of it, it was so large, but I enjoyed every bit of it.  The counter gal was super friendly and helpful, even filling up a small cup with mayonnaise for hubby's fries, and each table had ketchup and mustard along with the salt and pepper. A nice selection of hot sauces was located near the soda machine.  As I'm not a fan of Pepsi or tea, I was happy that the gal offered me a water cup, but that OJ was amazing. The selection of drinks in their cooler wasn't appealing either. So, they only have one beverage or water for my options, but the food more than makes up for it.",

When I said it was my first time here, she walked me through the entire menu and talked a bit about the Canadian heritage of the restaurant.   I got the Dirty Bird which is what's one of more popular but less healthy things here. It was about $13 and I swear I gained 3 pounds post-brunch but it was soooooooo worth it. Probably one of the best meals I've ever had even though you can't eat like this all the time for obvious reasons. It was the classic chicken + waffles stack but with powdered sugar on sweeter waffles, maple syrup, cheese, and really flavorful fries - the poutine influence is pretty obvious. Highly highly recommend this place if you're very hungry or hungover.",

The people at the Munch Boy know your desires and have a lot of stuff you can stuff into your mouth to fill up your belly.   It's a small place but with so much great food inside, that I almost can't believe people eat anywhere else. Fresh fruit, delicious eggs, quinoa salad, wonderfully fresh and toasted bread (not your typical squishy white toast, I promise), fresh squeezed orange juice and all the hot sauces you will ever need.   A really great place with super friendly people that deserve to serve you more often!",

    "text": "Really cool little spot. When I lived in NY, there used to be a little bagel spot that sold bagels, sandwiches and 3 non-pretentious breakfast dishes. This is a more modern, Anthem version of that kind of place.  The girl who usually works the front counter is very friendly and will help navigate you through the small menu.  The menu is pretty straight forward. A few sandwiches, pancakes, French toast and some ways to modify those few things.   First time here I got the breakfast sandwich that has the hash browns on the inside. I enjoyed it but the bagel and hash browns was way to much starch. If you get that go with a sliced bread instead of bagel. Also have had the avocado turkey grilled  cheese which was AWESOME!   This time around I went with a build your own breakfast sandwich with fried egg, bacon, pepper jack cheese on rye. While my wife got the strawberry Nutella pancakes (without the Nutella *shrugs in confusion*).  My sandwich was delicious. I got it as a combo with fries since last time I tried the hash browns and home fries.   My wife's pancakes were good too. Had the right bite a pancake should have while still feeling fluffy. Had a lot of vanilla in the batter which came through.   One thing I'm not stoked on is it's a little pricey for what it is. To be fair the portions are massive. Which is why I don't count it against them, but I'd rather have the 2 massive pancakes I can finish and pay a little less. I'm the oldest of four boys and I can put down some food. Both times I came here I couldn't finish my plate.   Overall a really good place my wife and I stop at when we are in the area. Grilled cheese turkey avocado is the best thing I've had there.",

My hubby got a Philly cheese steak sandwich which was good, the pepper and onion pieces weren't too big so they weren't too overwhelming. It didn't have too much cheese which was a bummer cause I love me some cheese but im sure you can ask for extra. The fries were the perfect amount of crisp.  I got a salad for lunch and man I will say they did not cheap out in the avocado. They gave me enough for the whole salad which I will say was HUGE. I had to put half my salad in another container so I can mix it properly  which I think is a great problem to have     What i was mostly impressed with was the hot sauce bar, mainly because they HAVE one. Most places only have Tabasco but they have all the good stuff and more. The entire restaurant including the bathroom was very clean. Needless to say ill be back.",

    "text": "ZERO STARS!!! We actually live in Henderson--we are not random visitors or one-offs, so we stupidly have tried Munchbox multiple times. Today was the very LAST time I will ever try giving them \"just one more shot.\"  Ordered the philly steak omelette thinking I would actually GET philly STEAK meat. Oh no!, what you really get is HAMBURGER MEAT!!! I went up and asked about it and was told by a short, long-dark haired woman this ground up chunky meat was philly steak and they have another (presumably ground up BEEF) they use for \"hamburger\"...  they offered no substitution no refund NOTHING for a Falsely advertised menu item. So I proceed to eat my wheat toast that came WAY before my meal so it was ice cold now and a small scoop of \"fresh\" fruit that was over ripe and mushy. In the midst of this my husband picks up a slice of bacon from his plate and finds A LONG DARK HAIR STUCK TO IT !!!  He goes up to alert the cashier, who turned to the same short, long-dark haired woman that blew me off because seemingly she is in charge (the cashier kid kept deferring everything to her), and she actually physically SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS and went about her task!!!  Seriously! Also while we were there a young woman came in with two little children to pick up a TO GO order (more on this in a sec) and she took the time to confirm ALL of their side items and condiments were packed as well. For the third time the same dark-haired woman was consulted and she said yes everything is in there she packed it herself. A few minutes later the young woman comes back in holding the bag of condiments and such to alert them that items were, in fact, missing!!! I am SHOCKED BEYOND BELIEF!!! How did we NOT see this coming? Actually I did-- as soon as she asked about it, DOOMED!, that crap just happens. After the hairy bacon discovery with again no offer to make it right received from the short, long-dark haired woman, for ANYTHING THEY HAD SCREWED UP to anyone there, my husband said basically screw this and we left. Now about the TO GO orders. Carry out appears to be  the vast majority of their business the 3-4 times we ate there--I'm guessing a large part is because they have VERY limited seating AND all the people who come in for carry out take up the seating while they wait so that dine in customers are screwed until someone finally leaves! They should NOT allow that and designate a space for carry out customers to sit. There is room for that. Eat at this horrid place at your own risk, but there are too many fabulous eateries in Henderson that makes Munchbox an easy one to ignore.   Response is EXACTLY what we expected as well--total ignorance in response to the issue of the fact the menu states Philly Steak but it is GROUND UP meat of some sort AND there was HAIR in our food. Our \"argument\" was actually our venting to each other our disbelief that dine in customers are sacrificed for carry out customers so there is never sufficient seating. Perhaps this owner should take a class or two on how to run a business successfully and not continue to repeat her bad business practices. Throwing food on the floor? Just another complete lie but again launching an ad hominem attack instead of owning up to what she did and DID NOT DO to correct her issues. Return there um yeah WE'RE good thanks.",

    "text": "Here we have an interesting find. Munch Box has a fantastic menu filled with all sorts of both familiar and unique selections. This was my first impression of the restaurant, and I chose to go with something unique. I went with their Poutine Burger, which included french fries (on the burger), melted cheddar cheese, bacon, a fried egg, gravy and cheese curds. It took a quick moment to get used to the gravy on a burger but successfully got a positive reaction from my taste buds.   It is a massive burger, thus you find yourself using the fork and knife vs trying to manhandle it. Taking it into your hand would simply result in a mess all over the place. The burger comes out steaming (literally, as you can see in one of the pictures), and looking pretty much just like the picture (which is hard to find these days).   I would recommend choosing a side other than french fries. Since the burger has fries within it, having them on the side was a bit overkill (my fault).  The burger itself could benefit from just a touch of pink. I get the liability involved in cooking something well, but the taste buds demand what the taste buds demand, and a little more juice I think would add a finishing touch to it. Beyond that, it was a fantastic meal and I will find myself coming back for sure.",

She sold me on a croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, hashbrowns, pepper jack, and bacon.  The bacon and eggs were burnt, so I ate a little of those and removed them from the sandwich. This left me with a lifeless croissant, cheese, and hashbrown mix, which was ok.  I also got a free soda, but the coke was kind of flat.  I went in there expecting a really good sandwich based on a yelp status of 4.5 stars and got something I wouldn't make at home. I'd actually be embarrassed to serve a sandwich like that.   Please don't burn eggs and bacon. Also, make the sandwiches more flavorful somehow. But keep those girls up front. They were professional and friendly. Without them this review would be a 1 star!",

The chicken avocado wrap I had with the tomato wrap was pretty good, for me it was a little dry because there was no sauce with it. It would have been nice with like a light vinaigrette or something along those lines, but the chicken was delish. It came with a side with choices being a fruit salad, mixed greens or fries; I chose the fruits! Much yummm. I'll be back :)",

Well let me just say that this is the best bagel I've ever had  !! I ordered the \" ultimate\" bagel and it was huge!

The vegan power greens salad is beautiful and delicious, full of strawberries and avocado on mixed greens with a delightful fruity dressing. The build a breakfast sandwich (bagel, ham, fried egg and tomato) was also a big hit. I haven't been inside the store to report on service but the food is delicious!",

Not sure what to do or where to go....I fired up the yelp app to see what options were available in the area.    Munch Box......hmmmmmm......what is this?  Located in the southeast corner of Horizon Ridge & Eastern, we decided to find out.  Upon arrival, I observed that Munch Box was very busy and consisted of tight quarters.  I started to trip out but after a couple of deep breathes coupled with some curiosity....I calmed down, accepted that this was a happening place and checked out the menu.  It was then that the \"Munch Box Poutine Burger\" caught my eye and was ordered.  Everyone working here appeared to be in good spirits and kept everything moving along as bodies left and more bodies arrived.  My burger contained cheese, egg, gravy coated fries with cheese curds and bacon. These ingredients make for an amazing combination.  Be sure to check in on the yelp app to receive a free drink.  Worth the wait and I am sure to visit again.",

Located in the smiths shopping center, munch box allows you to create your own sandwiches, wraps, etc or go with the originals on the board.  We ordered the chicken and waffles and a chicken philly cheese wrap. Both were amazing and really big portions.  The guys who work there were super nice and everything tasted fresh.     We will be back and next time we're getting the Nutella strawberry pancakes!",

    "text": "Wow, this place went beyond my exceptions for a small diner.   Upon arrival the staff was extremely helpful.  This is one of the things that I enjoyed seeing, that the staff was happy. It shows that they love their job.  The workers greeted everyone in the door as well as out. In addition, there was someone who periodically swept the floors and clean the counters and prepare the for their next guest. For having only one restroom, you could tell that the staff does their best to keep it tidy and clean.   I really enjoyed the menu and the different options that it provided.  For my first time visiting the menu is big, but it is not overwhelming. Also, if you are allergic to wheat and looking to eat healthy, then this is the place for you. They have a variety of options such as gluten free, wheat free, spinach wraps and more to choose from.  If you are looking for somewhere to eat and are in a hurry, then this is definitely the place to visit for quality fresh food. Additionally, I also enjoyed that they had a variety of teas and sauces to choose from that made my meal interesting.   However, the only thing that was a downfall from my perspective are the cups. I ordered a tea and you have to pay attention to the design of the cup because the texture resembles the cup you use for a fountain drink.  I feel as if it had a card-board wrap to wrap around the drink it would help distinguish the two, as well as making the hot drink easier to hold.   Above all, I was extremely impressed by the cleanliness, professionalism and the quality of food.",

I always get the Philly Chicken Cheesesteak and fries. I love, love, love it! It's so freshly made, that I don't have enough time on my lunch to wait for it to cool down. Unconventional, but I just dig in with fork and knife! I have yet to try other things on the menu, but everything looks so good and are reasonably priced!  On top of the yummy food, the customer service is the best, hands down! They welcome you with glowing smiles and know me by order. I love the staff there!",

    "text": "Tucked into a tiny little space next to BaskinRobins, this place doesn't really stand out that much - just goes to show that one can't judge a book by its cover, because the food is amazing!  I ordered pickup, so my time spent in the store wasn't a lot, but I had a very good first impression.  The interior looked very clean and well maintained.  Far beyond half the the food places I usually go to.  It's cozy, but not too overwhelming like a lot of the coffee shops.  I could see myself spending an hour or more here (maybe I will next time I come). The service was nice, promt, and most importantly, felt very personal.  I had ordered a croissant Tijuana sandwich and their famous Poutine.  Was very impressed with how it looked: usually food doesn't look as good as the advertisement, but this looked better!  See how the cheese stretched? While the Tijuana satisfied me, I'll be looking to try another sandwich next time.  It's still one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, but it was just a little too well blended for me:  the first bite tasted exactly the same as the last.  Very good as comfort food, but not very...exciting.    The poutine, though!  Everything the reviews said and more!  I'll admit, I had doubts and deliberated a long time before choosing to order it.  Who wants limp fries instead of crispy ones? Well, the potato skins more than make up for the lack of crispiness. And, the cheese and gravy on top adds much more flavor than mere salt.  Plus, the texture is amazing!  You don't really feel like you're eating fries, really.  I really don't know what else to say to describe how wonderful this dish is. And it looks so very tasty!This Poutine is a \"must order\"...although you might want to order it by itself instead of with a sandwich like me.  The portions are enormous; I think it might last me enough for three whole meals.",

My mother in law is in town and we wanted to check out a new spot somewhere near the house so after searching on Yelp we came across this spot... the decor and the way everything is set up is super cute...they have all your needs for drinks , sauces and anything extra you might need... the place is really clean and the service was great! The chick with the blue hair was awesome! She had fantastic customer service and was genuinely super sweet and cool... we all ordered something different and all love the food! Everything made fresh on the spot and it tasted delicious! Will be coming back again soon!",

I had the grilled chicken club on sourdough, my wife had a \"create your own bagel sandwich\", and we were both very pleased.   The French fries were actually great!!!! Usually fries are a standard side, nothing more, but these had fantastic flavor. A must-get.... go figure.   When in Henderson, we will definitely be dropping back by!!!",

If you have dietary restrictions, or just don't want certain things on your sandwich, this place is the answer! You choose your , bread, cheese, toppings...etc. OH!!! And Poutine!!!OMG! Also, Mom's Famous Fries....I was told the secret,,,they peel them first before they fry them. they are not afraid to go the extra step to give quality food! Thanks to Savannah for welcoming me and being such a great customer service rep for the company...So Sweet, and the pride that James takes is evident in every dish he delivers...Amazing , Skilled , and well trained...I'd say he's ready for Next Food Network Star!....Don't Pass this Place up,,,but please, save me a table!!!",

Bagels, sandwiches, wraps - nothing fancy or out of the ordinary, but really good and prepared fresh in front of you.   For all the praise I give the food and friendly staff, the place itself is not up to standard. The floor almost always seems dirty because of the very poor tile work, and seating is not very welcoming. They also could improve the lighting in their establishment - it's just not \"light\" enough in there and a change in light bulbs would achieve that. All in all the place is run down hence making it an ideal order to go spot.",

You might as well go over to Smith's and buy bread, turkey, avocado, and pepper jack and make it yourself.  The avocado was not cut well so it was just a big clump in the sandwich. And the fries were incredibly greasy, soggy, and not even salted.  The only reason this isn't a one star is because the staff there is very friendly and helpful. Overall, the food isn't that great for the price you're paying but the service is good.",

I got the turkey grilled cheese sandwich on the brioche bun from their lunch menu with a side of fruit. I don't know why i got a side fruit, should have gotten fries. Sandwich was good, better with Tapatio. Brioche bun was underwhelming, would have been better with a croissant or everything bagel. Next time order with my stomach and not my head. Side of fruit was the typical green grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon. Like i mentioned before, i should have gone with my stomach and got the fries. Their fries seem to have great reviews.  This is the second time i have been and i'll most likely will be back. Great place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich without going to your typical fast food. I recommend also preordering through yelp. Very convenient to walk in and walk out without waiting for your food especially when you are busy.",

It is easy to miss even if you know that it is in that shopping center because of the odd location. But if you are looking for a quality, inexpensive quick lunch this is certainly a place to go. Their signature dish is the poutine. This is a dish made of french fries, beef gravy and cheese curds. We added pork tenderloin for another three and a half dollars. Definitely a worthwhile addition. It is a huge portion so unless you are really hungry , come with someone to share the dish with. I also ordered the turkey avocado grilled cheese sandwich. Also absolutely delicious. This is a great choice for a non-chain restaurant for a quick delicious inexpensive lunch.",

The staff is very enthusiastic, helpful, and informed. The food options are awesome for breakfast and lunch with a lot of \"build-your-own\" options. I opted for the wrap which I filled with breakfast fillings such as eggs, turkey, cheese, spinach, & mushrooms. The only reason that Munch Box is not getting 5 stars from me yet is for the lack of flavor that my wrap had. Tasted like the eggs, meat, and veggies had no seasoning on them which was sort of disappointing. I will be back to give it another try though! I also enjoyed their station of hot sauces and condiments which helped enhance the flavor of my meal.",

Well, that \"one day\" came and we decided to go in a try it out.    When we walked in, we were greeted by the 3 staff that were working behind the counter.  Very nice. We took a gander at the menu to see what would satisfy our hungry bellies. When we were ready, he was ready with a smile. I ordered the avocado grilled cheese with french fries (yes, starch on starch), my mom ordered the Simple Breakfast which came with 2 eggs, hash brown, sausage and toast, and my niece, being the picky eater she is, got pancakes.    After our order was placed, we took a seat and waited.  The wait was not long, though! Our food came out in a jif.  On to the goods, my grilled cheese was very good, with the right amount of cheese. They didn't skimp on the cheese, which can make or break a grilled cheese. The avocado was just right! So good. And those fries! I like my fries to have a little crunch to them, and that's exactly what they had, a crunch. Not all of them, for those of you wondering about my teeth. My mom really enjoyed her meal, especially the sausage. My niece even stole some pieces of the plate.   My mom took my niece to the bathroom, and one of the guys behind the counter asked me if my niece at all her food. I replied yes, and he brought out a treat for her! I thought that was so nice of him. Definitely a family mentality. She was very surprised when she came back from the bathroom.  I'm so glad we made it in to Munch Box, after days of anticipation. We mostly definitely will be back!",

    "text": "When I first came here I had some definite suspicions; I mean how they could they get such a great rating in such a short amount of time? Well, now I know.   The \"Munch Box\" which sounds like a restaurant in the Tarantino movie universe took over the space that used to be owned by probably the worst deli/cafe that I've ever patronized. Not much has changed in the style department here, but the menu is a complete overhaul. It's all the bagel sandwich staples, lox, and capers, a variety of egg sandwiches, along with salads, deli sammies, and a full omelet menu. I've been here twice now and both times the food has been fantastic and made quick. The one downside is there no iced coffee offered, only hot coffee. Bummer!   I tried the Tijuana breakfast sandwich, the three cheese egg sandwich, and the Poutine. The Tijuana is the one to get and comes stacked with three egg whites, jalapeno cream cheese, and whatever protein or bagel you want. I went with sausage and a jalapeno cheese bagel, which was super messy, but totally worth the seven napkins that were used to clean my face. This wasn't too spicy and was very filling.   The surprise here is how good the Poutine tasted. No frills or crazy add-ons, just basic French fries, cheese curds, and brown gravy on top. This is a huge portion of food and could easily be shared with an another box muncher.   This box is totally worth a munch. Come by and sink your teeth in.   PRO TIP: Check-in for a free coffee or soda!",

We were greeted by a very friendly woman to send to take so much pride in the establishment and hospitality, she must have been the owner. Super friendly and helpful. The ordering experience was easy and quick because she quickly offered options and eventually offered up a \"build your own\" solution. The food came out very quickly and tasted amazing. If we lived in Vegas, this please would be heavy in our rotation. My fiancee wanted me to add the bags with the Munch Box stamp were super cute. In all, we had a wonderful breakfast and a road snack a couple hours later because the portions were just big enough to eat half there, and half later.   I had a breakfast sandwich with eggs, bacon, hash browns, and Swiss, on a crescent. Fiancee had a breakfast burrito with similar ingredients.  Great food, clean and upbeat atmosphere, and very delightful owner. I would recommend to everyone I care about, and not mention this place to people I don't because I wouldn't want to see them there. Go try this place ASAP!!",

A little thinner than the New York style you're used to, but have a nice sweetness.  Very good and perfect for sandwiches. My lox sandwich and side of fruit hit the spot.  Not the largest, but for under $10 I think that's fine with quality smoked salmon and freshly cooked bagels. Munch Box, as it specializes in breakfast/lunch, has some good deals for building your own sandwich for $8 or adding a drink and side for under $3.  As a lunch spot, the variety was good and service was super fast.  They also have a very good system of ordering online to easily get your meal to go.  Munch Box is a good addition to the area.",
