I would highly recommend all you can eat and if you do try the orange blossom , Miso salmon, garlic Tuna, and vampire roll. Those are my top picks. I also recommend going during lunch it's less crowded and speedy service. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because of 1 not so great experience we had.  My husband and I decided to go for dinner and it was super busy. Our favorite waitress was there and she sat us immediately. It wasn't her section so she told us she would send over our waiter. I saw her point to our table and he nodded. 5min go by then 10 then 15 and he still hasn't even came to introduce himself or ask for drinks. Our favorite waitress must of seen me looking around because she rushed over and said she would take our order once the waiter saw that he stopped her and said he would take our order. He got our drink order and left... didn't ask if we wanted food and definitely didn't even give us a chance to say we where ready. After another 10min he came and took our order. That was the last time he came to the table before we left. He honestly only paid attention to one table and the rest of us in his section ended up being helped by every other waitress except him. We put in another order with another waitress and 2min later our original waiter brings us our check... I stop him before he rushes off and let him know we are not done eating and that we have ordered more food he just goes oh ok. That was the last time we saw him that night. Thankfully the waitresses made sure to help us whenever they could. Other then this 1 bad experience we absolutely love it here. All the waitress are so sweet with our son and very polite and helpful.",

    "text": "As we walked in (my bf and I) we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or table. Of course we sat at the bar since we decided to do the all you can eat since we don't really do the specialty rolls we just do the plan sushi. If you love the specialty rolls they do have a wide selection.  Order up: 4 orders of Octopus 1 order of Uni (so I finally decided to try it and it's totally not for me; It really taste like the ocean.) 4 orders of Baked Green Mussels (good size) 5 orders of Surf Clam (my bf really loves surf clam) 1 Order of fresh water Eel 1 Order of the Hard Rock Roll (not too bad)  1 Order of Oysters (delicious) 1 order of screaming orgasm (I've had better) 1 order of crab salad  1 cheesecake   So yes you can say we got our money worth. AYCE $26.95 Dinner $20.95 Lunch and just add $5 for all you can drink (domestic beers). They also really do time you because the chiefs tell you that your time is up and you can't order anymore (happened to the people sitting next to us). I know the rules for AYCE but every place I have gone to has never said that to anyone.   Overall the service was good, no wait time, clean, and the food was good. So yes I would recommend this place but if you have a big crowd I wouldn't be so sure because if you do decide to do AYCE you might not get your money worth since they do really time you.",

All the waitresses I have had have a bad attitude and make me feel unwelcome.  But let's not forget the sushi chefs that are even less engaging and seem bothered when you order. One chef NEVER once said hello. And when you order AYCE after every order they ask \" would you like anything else sir \" which to me says \" are you done \"  Ok now that the atmosphere is set lets talk about the food.   All I can say is that it is average at best. Nothing special at all.   Lastly , this is a local place for me so I will probably go back,  but only in an emergency.   Question for all here. Do a lot of AYCE sushi bars seem to have people that own or work there have poor attitudes? Almost like your bothering them.  Interesting when most of them , like this place, are empty.. Wonder why?",

Wow that's awesome :) unfortunately, their quality of food was awful  & I felt rushed the entire time. They have cameras watching every table just to ensure there is NO SHARING, which is bluntly stated on their ridiculous  unprofessional signs taped at each table.  The \"crunch #1\" was delicious & the \"dancing eel\" was okay. Other then that I would not recommend the tempura because their batter is way too thick. I would not recommend this place to anyone  & I will not eat there ever again. Their prices are too high for the quality of food they serve. How can one relax and enjoy dinner with their family when a camera is staring at them the entire time??",

If you like Toro and Engawa, don't come to an AYCE place....  Anyway, 5-stars for being one of the better \"Ichiro Mashita\" style sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.   Don't leave a negative review because it wasn't Traditional Edomaezushi. AYCE themed restaurants and Traditional Edomae style are two completely different styles of cuisine. Yet, I always see countless self proclaimed sushi experts give a AYCE place a negative review because they thought they could get Toro, Halibut, Sea Eel, and Bonito. At a traditional Edomaezushi restaurant they will give you a hot towel when you come in because you are going to have to eat with your hands. You get no chopsticks, soy sauce, or wasabi. You also usually have to take your shoes off. Then you get a piece of unrefrigerated fish that was killed minutes earlier. AYCE themed restaurants were a result of Ichiro Mashita combining aspects of Edomaezushi with other types of Japanese cuisine such as Tempura, Teriyaki, Yakiniku.  It's a completely different variation of Sushi.   The food here at KRAZY SUSHI is practically identical to all the other AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas. It's on the better side though.  Practically every AYCE sushi place in LV has an identical menu, and identically themed rolls. They always have rolls named after casinos and something called \"orgasm sauce\".   I like the nigri here. You get about 70 percent fish and 30 percent rice. It's a perfect combination. They also have all the types of of fish you would expect to find at an AYCE sushi place. They got everything from Albacore, Unagi, Saba, Salmon-Sake, Sweet Shrimp, Majuro, Yellow Tail and more.    You know, I like AYCE sushi places better than Traditional. I always come to an AYCE place at the end of  a long difficult week of working out. I spend at least 3-4 hours a day working out and my body fat is usually only around 4-6%. Therefore, I feel very lethargic and tired  on some days. These AYCE sush places have a perfect balance of carbs and proteins to help replace my glycogen and repair my damaged muscles. If your an athlete, I recommend AYCE sushi.",

She was always very good and we were happy to see her again.  On to the food :   The Nigri sushi tasted fresh , even on a Monday ...  though it was slightly smaller and a little more rice than other places.     The rolls my wife an i ate were full of flavor and were not overly done with sauce ( usually a bad sign ) .   She said her mouth was on fire from the spicy tuna , which is a plus as most places are a little light on the heat with spicy tuna.  She enjoyed it.   The Miso Soup was tasty and the tempura shrimp was o.k. Had a little too much batter , but each his own.      The Vanilla and Strawberry mochi , were identical to any mochi i have ever had , so nothing to say there   Will we repeat ? Definitly , but it will be a month or so before we are able to do so.",

    "text": "It was so awkward entering. It was lunchtime and it wasnt even busy. We stood there confused. Do we seat ourselves? Do we wait for the waitress who has her back facing the door because she is facing her register? Why are the two chefs huddled talking to each other, looking towards me and not even saying anything? No irasshaimase or hello? I already had a whole yelp review typed out within the longest minute and a half. When the waitress finally noticed...the chefs finally said hi. Uhhh. My butt was already clenching. Why do I always get such luck.  Turns out...the waitress is super super sweet and nice as is the other wait staff that came to check on us. The service was quick. My husband chose to do the AYCE for about 21 bucks. I would've done the AYCE, however, they do not allow you to share food with a 2 year old! My 2 year old eats, but not really. Anyone with such a kid can understand.   Instead, I ordered their beef bulgogi lunch special. Miso soup, salad, veggie tempura, cali rolls, rice and the beef. I shared with my 2 year old and it was enough for he and I to share. He doesn't eat a whole lot in one sitting so the meat and rice was perfect serving for him as there was enough meat left for me to pick off.on top of all the other items I finished off.  They have open tables and private booths which I really loved because I'm such a recluse private type of person especially while.dining.  My husband thought their sushi wasn't bad at all, and since he works nearby...it'd be a good spot to fulfill his lunchbreak sushi crave. Neither of us thought it'd be a place we'd go out our way for, though, especially since we have a decent AYCE nearby that allows us to share with toddlers. Realistically, we probably won't be returning because there was nothing worth returning for. However, once we finally got seated, service was pretty prompt.  Feel free to fulfill your curiosity. Definitely stroller friendly!",

They offered hamachi kama with the ACYE which is a plus! Overall the quality of their fish was enjoyable.  Their service was not too much to my liking. Although our server was very nice and always had a smile to her face I remember having to frequently ask for minor things or that we didn't have enough seating where we had to help ourselves. There was another person who delivered our food that could have used a little more customer service i.e. smile and not argue that there was already napkins on the table which fell on the floor earlier.",

    "text": "I've lived in the Centennial area for almost 7 years now and I have always seen this place, but never tried it until this past winter (we went about 3 times within 3 weeks).  My dad loves loves Japanese food and he knows I love sushi, so one day he mentioned how we've always passed by this place, but never tried it.  The pops can't eat as much as me anymore, but whenever he goes he likes to get their chicken teriyaki entree meals. It comes with chicken, rice, miso-soup and I believe one other thing which I can't remember. But he loves that and usually orders a tuna roll and tamago nigiri as well.   For me I looove all you can eat sushi and usually go  with friends so I don't have the burden to finish what I couldn't handle, but here I've been able to manage by myself. My favorite nigiri to order is their Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna. Some places give either too little/too much when it comes to the rice to fish ratio, but the 4 times I've gone, they gave just the right amount of both.   My favorite rolls to get for them include the Lobster Popcorn (4 pieces), My Favorite Roll, Crunchy California, Rainbow Roll, and Dancing Eel. For the most part I stick to those when I go there because they have what I like inside them and are usually not spicy (I'm bad with spicy). But I'm sure all their other rolls are great too. Everything tastes fresh and the texture of the fish/rolls are on point for my liking.  Like many other sushi places, if you're on a date of two or have like a small group of 3, try to sit at the bar because you get your sushi so much faster and can order directly with the chefs. They're always smiling, nice, and quick to get your rolls to you!",

We asked how it worked and were told that he could order anything from the menu. He ordered 2 rolls and a poke bowl.   Roll 1 was drenched in sauce/mayo and could not be tasted. Roll 2 was just ok. Poke Bowl had tuna and seaweed that were not fresh.  We asked for fresh ginger and fresh wasabi - but the ginger was pickled and the wasabi was an upcharge.   He had 3 pieces left on the plates when he wanted to order one more item. The same server who informed us that everything on menu was included - then told us that the yellowtail was actually not included.  And oh - the clincher - we were also gonna be charged for the leftover pieces. What?! When we asked her why she didn't say something when we initially asked how the \"all-you-can-eat\" worked, she proceeded to say that's what everyone else does.  she then explained that they just got new menus and that information used to be on there but not anymore. She also acknowledged she did not tell us before ordering, so at the end she did not charge us.   So disappointed. The bad service really kills me. The food was mediocre at best. If you are an experienced sushi eater - this is NOT the place for you.",

Sure, the food is not top notch but it is more than decent to satisfy a sushi / japanese food craving.   The AYCE allows you to order half rolls and that's definitely a plus. You can try multiple rolls without getting a food coma (I mean, you'll still get it anyway but at least from 4-5 different rolls haha). I though the fish was good when I was there. It didn't seem like it was old or had some crappy aftertaste.   All in all, not the best sushi I've had but I'll give it a thumbs up for being a local place that is fairly priced and can satisfy a craving.",

    "text": "As an all you can eat sushi addict, Krazy Sushi is one of my least favorite in Vegas. We came here for dinner on a Thursday night. When we first walked in, we weren't greeted for almost 5 mins even though the server and sushi chef saw us. There was only 2 other tables so it was not busy at all. However, they did seem understaffed with just one server and two sushi chefs.   When we were finally seated, we placed our order with the server. We typically order 10 orders of nigiri, an appetizer and two rolls. My husband and I know what we like so we prefer to order it all at once. I understand this order may seem a lot, but this isn't our first rodeo. While ordering, she kept informing us that if we don't finish our food it'll be charged. After the third time she said it, I finally told her we got it and to stop telling us. Geeze lady, there's signs everywhere and after telling someone two times you'd imagine they'd back off.   FOOD: The fish quality was low and there was an intense fishy after taste. The only nigiri that was good is the super white tuna. Other than that, I wouldn't come back for any raw fish. The fish tasted dry and old. The rice to fish ratio on the nigiri wasn't great, there definitely was a lot more rice than fish.   We ordered the tiger roll. There was a lot of sauce and too much rice. If you're into a sushi experience where you love rice heavy and overly drenched saucy rolls, then this is your place.   However, for me I didn't enjoy my experience at Krazy sushi.  Happy Dining,   J Tran",

I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and I never use the 'race' card, but being the only latino patrons there makes me wonder if that was the issue? It shouldn't have been  considering the sushi chef himself was Mexican as was the cook in the back.

They were basically begging for us to order the All you can eat (more revenue). We had one specific order and they screwed that up. The rolls were made like crap...3/4's of them fell apart trying to pick up. Sushi is not their strong point unless that's the standard. I could keep going with a couple more minor issues but have to move on. We gave them a try 3 times and it got worse and wrse.

Ok first of all they have an all you can eat option but we ordered a Spider Roll, yellowtail Nigiri, Tuna Nigiri, chicken teriyaki, and tempura.   It took 45 min to get our food. Waitress didn't seem to speak English. Spider roll was so damn small... It gets worse. The nigiri slabs were so thin. Tempura tasted soggy not crunchy, as if it were sitting out for a while or maybe they recycled it who knows so I didn't end up eating it. After the 45 min wait the waitress \"forgot\" our order of chicken teriyaki. We should've just let it go cuz it was pretty much chicken made on a George Foreman doused in sugary syrupy sauce. Gross!  Don't waste your money here if you like quality food. Tables were dirty as well and so were the floors. Slow service.",

    "text": "As a first time visitor, I was uncertain - but felt that the positive reviews out -weighed the negative ones.  We sat and Yun and her sidekick server were attentive to and discussed the rules of all you can eat.  There were signs posted about time limits, items not eaten etc.  Yun assured us that the 45 minute time allotment for lunch would not be observed, and we could take our time...relief settled in that we weren't going to be rushed shoving sushi rolls into our mouths quicker than we could order them.  She did make it VERY clear that uneaten food would be charged...so eat up!    It did get a little confusing that somethings were lunch menu AYCE only and other things were only offered at dinner.  None the less the options were plenty and we chose from the menu accordingly.    We asked for suggestions, and went with a few of hers, other reviewers and a few of our own.  Everything was tasty and full of flavor.  Yun was attentive and checked back often.    They do not offer half rolls as other places do except on your last order.  Yun was clear that once a half roll was ordered, that was it - no turning back - you were done eating.  This would be great if they could offer half rolls as an option so when dining with only 2 people you could sample more of the menu.   Food was fresh and flavorful (rolls could be a little tighter IMO) and service was great.  No complaints about the staff here!    Would return again!",

Then, my husband and I decided to do the \"all you can eat\" which is about $26 per person, and ordered 5 rolls between us. The menu says the \"all you can eat\" rolls are smaller than the regular rolls - but they are not. The rolls were huge (and honestly, not that great tasting). This would be a good thing, except they say on the menu that if you don't finish what you ordered, you have to pay for any uneaten rolls. If the rolls had actually been smaller as the menu said they would be, we would have finished them. But we were totally stuffed, and had 4 pieces left, all from different rolls. So, the server picked the most expensive roll we ordered ($14.99) and charged us the full price for that roll, ON TOP of us paying $26 each.   So all in all, we spent $80 for 5 mediocre sushi rolls. If we had paid al la cart, it would have been around $55. So basically, we threw $25 down the drain. I feel like we got ripped off on purpose. Definitely not worth it.",

We were not impressed by any means. It was a bit higher priced than what we're used to and didn't really care for any of the food. It all just tasted basic, nothing special. There wasn't any roll that I started eating and thought \"Man, I want some more of this.\" We were pretty disappointed since the food looked good, but didn't meet our expectations of how good sushi rolls should taste. There are a few other places in the northwest area that we definitely like a lot better. I don't think I would come back here again. It also took our server awhile to come back every time we needed something. I know we had a large group, but the place wasn't even that busy when we got there. The people who work there are super nice, I'll give them that, but this place just wasn't for us.",

My favorite nigiri was the special item (you can't find it on the menu) called Toro. It had fresh wasabi on it too! I don't usually like wasabi, but the fresh wasabi was so good that we ordered extra on the side. Sadly, I couldn't get a picture of the toro because we devoured it all too quickly along with all of the other nigiri that came out. Last but not the least, the fried oreo dessert is a MUST. It came with a cute scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of it, which contrasted with the warm, crispy fried oreo so well. Highly recommend to anyone in the area craving sushi!",

Not to mention, they have a sign that says if you write them a yelp review they'll give you a free dessert so I wouldn't trust any good reviews you see. It's probably just people trying to get free ice cream.",

I ordered a lasagna roll and it was nasty! I couldn't even finish it. Way too much cream cheese. I asked for eel sauce and they brought me cold jello texture eel sauce. I ordered the baker mussels still had sand in it and on the menu it says 5 pieces but they only brought my 4. So I asked the server why did I only get 4 and she said they changed it to just 4 now. You would think they would change their menu and price on it. Nobody refilled our drinks either. My husband had all you can eat and he wasn't satisfied either. Food quality went down",

We always have the same server, Judy. She is so sweet and so kind to our little boy when we bring him with. The service is so quick too and if something takes more then a few minutes they let you know when you order. We are so glad we found this place!!!!",

The restaurant is small-ish, but very clean and the staff was extremely friendly.   The sushi was good, not the best I've had, but very good. I really liked the Orange Blossom roll with some kind of Japanese sweet mustard (that may not be exactly right).    Short review, but bottom line is I'll be back again soon!  On edit:  I guess the $20 AYCE pricing is for lunch only.  Dinner is $25, which is a fairly typical price for sushi.",

I believe this is the only ayce up in centennial area, and the price was decent too. But their sushi/rolls are meh. Seriously, it is mediocre at best so I'm kinda confused with the great reviews?!? I didn't like any of the rolls that I've ordered and the nigiri was nothing special. I'd rather to elsewhere and pay more for ala carte instead of eating at this mess. Maybe they have a high rating cuz there isn't much ayce sushi place in this area.",

The I Love Starbucks roll and Mr. Crabby Patty are my favs! Try the spicy ramen, its great too! For dessert I get the Fried Oreo or Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream.

We arrived with some pretty high expectations, beings the only sushi we have had in a while was from Smith's.  The language barrier was awful! We ordered the all you can eat. When asking questions about the menu, our waitress could not articulate, what she wanted to say. We ended up with items we did not want.  When it came time to use the restrooms, one would expect them to be clean, and operable. First impression, dirty, and needed to be updated. The toilet was leaking, and then when I went to wash my hands, the plumbing underneath the sink, was spraying me. This is a deal breaker. My husband and I will not go back in, until the sign outside reads \"newly remodeled\".",

Some of our favorite rolls are Snow White (we get it with spicy tuna instead of spicy crab) and Mr. Crabby Patty.  YUM!  The nice thing here is that they have several rolls that you can do half orders of (Snow White, Thug Life, Salmon Lover, to name a few).  Also, their super white tuna is fabulous!  If you want a different flavor mochi, try their black sesame flavor.....amazing!  All in all, we LOVE this place!  Super fresh fish/seafood and great service!!  Try them!",

Sat at the bar And got attention that rendered good service from the chefs.  I didn't like how they asked me to keep ordering before they sent one dish out. They like to drown the sushi in whatever sauce it is made with ie. mayo,eel sauce Also the drink server didn't pay much mind to us. The chef had to tell her to do things for us. Also They didn't do half a roll for all you can eat. But overall I would come back. If you near its a good place to try. I wish the served the appetizer screaming orgasm during lunch hours.",

So the way they make money is to cut the portion size and to add all sorts of fillers.  This place is no different. It's great if you want quantity over quality. That said it was only a few dollars cheaper than when you order a la carte from a place like Sushi Loca.  Let's start with the positives.  Fast service. Very friendly service. Variety of offerings.   Negatives: Ambiance -- meh.  Bathrooms -- little scary. Grimy and the sink fixtures were practically falling off.  Food -- mediocre at best. The rice was dry and stale or at other times soggy. Fish -- some pieces were fishy, some weren't.  Expensive drinks.   Probably won't go back.",

Their menu was very extensive, but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we got full too fast to realize several rolls could be ordered in half portions.  We ordered the house sake, and a $6 a bottle, we have no right to complain. It wasn't the worst I've ever had, and the fact the bottles were \"Buy 2 Get 1 Free\" was motivation enough!

This is the only AYCE sushi close by to home. Service could be better, it might take a while til I return.",

Eventually the owner Charlie messaged me to apologize for the past visits and promised the service and food had been improved. He invited to come back so I took him up on his offer.  My girlfriend and I visited on a late sunday evening only to be immediately greeted by our server Gina. She was extremely accomodating and assuring while always keeping a smile at the same time. Not once did she seem unpleasant or unhappy. She reccomended rolls for both of us to which my girlfriend and I took, along with some other rolls. I had the Johnny Roll #2 (sweet, flavorful) burn your boom hole (really hot), and salmon lovers (lots of salmon). The rolls were flavorful and savory. All in all everything was great. The place seemed more lively than I rememeber and the sushi has improved dramatically. I will be back as long as this consistency is always present.",

We ordered our rolls at the same time but one person in our group waited 30 minutes for his rolls to come out while the rest of us got our rolls within 15 minutes. We had to ask our waitress three times for the sushi trays for our soy sauce. We were finally able to get them after asking a different server and after we had our food! We also weren't given chop sticks until after our food had been delivered. Our waitress seemed pissed to be serving us because we had to ask her for so many things (which should've been done at the time of seating us - like setting the table!). I've been here once before and it was great so I was excited to bring friends there for a celebration and it ended up being a terrible time. I will not be returning here again unfortunately. The food is great but the service is beyond disappointing.",

    "text": "Alright...this was my 2nd time here. I'll review places with at least a couple of visits because it's not all of the time, where your first visit turns out bad or good. Sometimes I get a BigMac at McDonald's and it looks like straight from the commercial and tastes like it was made fresh from the grill, then there's days where it tastes like it was microwaved and looks nothing like a BigMac...anyway........Krazy Sushi has been consistent on both my visits. I only know about this place because my co-worker brought me here each time. He claims it's the best AYCE sushi place. I wouldn't go that far, but this place is good. It's located in Centennial Hills...I'm not from Las Vegas, just moved here a few months ago, but it's like 30 minutes from Summerlin & like 45 minutes from the strip...There's over 65 different types of sushi rolls that you can order...the place is pretty spacious. Bathroom was clean. Nothing bad to say about the employees...the rice wasn't watered down and the fish and everything else tasted great. Price is just about right for a AYCE place...One sushi I ordered was the Number 4 Burning Your Boom Hole because I love spicy things...if you do order this particular sushi roll, I recommend getting the sauce on the side. It's extremely spicy. Just a little dab of the sauce will have you drinking a lot of water. Take my word for it. I have a high tolerance for spicy things, actually lost my appendix from eating too much spicy food...All in all, I would recommend going here and giving it a try. It's a far drive, unless you're local in the area and it's located right off the freeway. I have pictures to give you a better idea of the scenery and what the food looks like...",

Gina, our server, was very attentive and friendly!  She made sure we had a five star experience.  She never seemed annoyed and always had a smile on her face.  I don't like crab meat and she made sure the sushi chefs didn't put crab in my rolls.  We came here because my boyfriend had a bad experience and the owner reached out to him to apologize.  It's very refreshing to see a business where the owner reaches out to people for service recovery! I will be back for more sushi soon!  It's very convenient to have to a good sushi place literally around the corner from my apartment.",

    "text": "Ordered delivery with Postmates because I didn't have my wallet and my son was wanting sushi. Order was correct and delivery was in the expected time. Fish was...not good. Poor quality. Chirashi bowl the color was off and the taste was bland to sour. I had to put soy sauce all over to eat the rest, which I never do. A yellowtail roll was also lackluster and not what I expected from a basic yellowtail. My son didn't finish his roll either and when I asked if he liked his nigiri, he said it was ok.   I can't speak to the service but for me sushi is all about the quality and it just wasn't here. With so many places in town, I doubt I'll try this place again.  There was another sushi place nearby on Postmates so maybe I'll try that, or hopefully have my wallet with me next time!",

This last time, I ordered sushi, my wife ordered sushi and soup.  The sushi rolls seemed like they were rolled by someone that has never rolled sushi before.  The fish was warm (which made the texture something like a firm piece of snot), and they repeatedly forgot my wife's miso soup after being reminded 3 times (took approximately 30 minutes to get it to us) which when she got it we were all done.   I decided to try some tempura vegetables because that is pretty hard to mess up.  It was ok, but. It great.  The sauce that should come with the tempura vegetable seemed like it was repurposed from something else's.  We were thinking of taking the time to go to Osaka for sushi, next time we will.",

The waitress who I'm pretty sure is the owner kept asking me and my cousin if we're sure we wanted to order all the rolls we ordered because if we can't finish it it will cost more. We ate 8 rolls. Finished. She kept giving us dirty looks and looked mad because we finished our food?? She also forgot to serve us the edamame we ordered. I'm a server myself so I don't accept this kind of service.

We opted for Krazy Sushi since UMAMI was apparently closed due to maintenance today.  Which was a bummer.   I definitely won't be back to this place. The sushi was \"Okay\" & the miso soup had no flavor whatsoever. Also, the menu says \"AYCE\" but they limit you on how many items each person can get. Therefore not being AYCE in reality. Also, this is the first place that every charges me for my 1 & 2 year old when the menu says 4 years and up are charged.",

I understand that you can be busy and may forget somethings but it was repetitive and our server was the partial owner, took the whole 45 minutes we were their to get our dynamite which we ordered at the start, then the partial owner denied us our free ayc thing from the stamp card for no apparent reason and when we asked continued to lie when we asked why bottom line we will not be going here anymore because of the blatant disregard for customer service.",

    "text": "This place is lucky I'm leaving one star. I would give it negative stars for its customer service.   This is my first yelp review. I specifically made a yelp account to write a review for this restaurant. I used to come here frequently, not sure what happened to its customer service. First off we get a waitress who was not friendly and extremely rude. I ask a simple question she replies with \"the description is on the bottom of the sushi\". She's referring to the menu. Actually in fact it was not. I can read, it's her job to answer the customers questions about their food items. We ordered all you can eat sushi which comes with a dessert choice. After we ate our food, which by the way was delivered to the wrong table and we had to wait longer. No big deal. We sat for at least 20 minutes waiting for our check. I finally kindly asked the waitress for our checks, forgetting she didn't offer the dessert that comes with our meals. So we kindly ask the waitress serving the table next to us \"can we please order 3 mochis, our waitress seems busy and we haven't been offered our dessert, but we paid for our meals\". This waitress who I won't say her name (because I know the owners read this) who was amazing took our order and kindly brought the mochi. With no complaints. She had a big smile on her face and she gave off such a more pleasant vibe than our original waitress. I asked her if they split tips since it seemed that waitresses were all helping each other out. She kindly said \"yes we all pull\", because I was going to give her a tip as well as our original waitress. Minutes go by and our original waitress is yelling at the waitress in front of all the guests because she kindly gave us customer service and was helping our waitress out by diffusing the situation. Come to find out our original waitress is the owners WIFE AND IS A OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT. So the OWNERS get a pull in the waiters and waitresses TIPS!!! So not only are the owners completely rude and treat their employees like dirt they also dip in their pockets and take partial of the tips!!!! When I confronted the owner/first waitress I told her (the other waitress) did nothing wrong and was giving us excellent customer service by doing what US CUSTOMERS ASKED and that was if we can get our deserts. I told her since you're the owner you should know how to talk to your employees and where to do it and that's behind closed doors. She proceeded to LIE to me and tell me she wasn't the owner, when in fact we already knew she was. I told her why should she care about The other waitress giving customer service when she gets a tip regardless. I work in the service industry and I know how to talk to my employees and how to treat customers. This woman is not someone I would ever want to work for/with, let alone dine in their restaurant again. I want to give a shout out to all the cooks, waiters, and waitresses who work their butts off and have to deal with this owner. We appreciate all of your work, even if the owners treat you guys like dog sh*t, us customers take notice. I will be back next week to give the other waitress a well deserved tip, but I will never dine here again.  Since  Charlie the owner read this maybe you should train your wife in how to treat your customers or your restaurant will go down hi   Review update: DOO J when are you guys going to look at all these Negative reviews about the owners wife? Does your restaurant still smell like someone took a dump and left it? Take some time and read all these similar reviews. Your place sucks",

House sake is decent for being very inexpensive.  The service at lunch was great. The average: While the sashimi IS fresh, the cuts were average.  The ginger is pink, the wasabi is an unsettling shade of green and both were kind of bland.  The chopsticks are very splintery.  Edamame was okay. The bad: Had a Philly Roll as a side to my Cocaine Sashimi plate, and the taste was just ... off.  But I usually prefer sashimi anyway so this didn't bother me much.  Bottom line: We will come here again for sushi because it's a mile from our house.  But we will definitely drive further if we want a high-quality sushi dinner.",

The Owner would not serve my son on all you can eat because my husband was not done with his roll. She said he has to eat his dads first. We frequently eat dinner here. NOT again, she continued to argue after she had my cc in her hand after repeated attempts from me to say. OK OK Just charge me so I can get out of here. The entire restaurant watching this shit show. Good luck with your unclean, dirty restaurant. Sad for the employees she runs around yelling at. #neveragain!",

They don't bring you plates unless u ask, they dont bring appetizers that are included in the all you can eat, they act like they forgot and ask you if you still want it. They went as far as telling me that if I dont eat all my sushi they would  charge me extra. What a joke. We will never eat here again, knorr do I recommend this place to anyone.

I had to cut the rice in half in order to get the ratio to something more managable where fish was more present in my mouth instead of mostly just tasting and feeling rice.  The waiter reminded me of the \"have to eat the rice rule\" when taking the plates away with half chunks of rice. I made sure to inform him that I wasn't trying to cheat, but the way the sushi was made it very difficult to enjoy. No dings against him as he was very polite about it, and we all know that's a standard rule, but its clear that the servings put customers at a disadvantage in enjoying their sushi like its supposed to be.  Prior to this, their fish cuts were always generous and on the money. Not sure what's changed, but if the goal is to cheap put on fish, customers will be lost.  Everything else was fine.",

    "text": "For those of you not interested in reading the details of my novel review, the best advice for this company if they really wanted to thrive with their consumers (based on the reviews I've read and then my own experience) is for the chefs to simply smile more and that would clear up the \"unfriendly vibe\" patrons are experiencing.  Because we actually didn't feel rushed or mistreated at all. And the server was a sweetheart! My chief suggestion to this business should be just to make sure not to cut corners with the freshness of their fish or authenticity of their sauces, because there are specific menu items we noticed the cut corners just a bit. (Eel sauce to be specific, tuna was odd color bit tasted fine, mackerel was salty salty and fishy...but not sure if mackerel is supposed to be to be honest)   I'm sure these couple things above are the root of the issue for most people.  NOW FOR MORE IN DEPTH READERS WITHOUT THE ATTENTION SPAN MAX OF 23 SECONDS :) :)   Upon reading the other reviews before we went here, we were a bit hesitant. Seeing as how this was the closest all you can eat sushi in our area, we decided to give it a whirl.  To comment first on the posts from other customers, my boyfriend and I did not find that the service, from either the chefs or the servers, was trying to rush us out. The server (a young lady) was extremely friendly, and voluntarily took the liberty to suggest menu items we might enjoy based on what items we had already ordered. In addition, these items ended up being the winners of our \"most ordered\" for the meal.  And yes they DO charge if you leave any sushi but I don't know ANY sushi place in town that DOESN'T do this for all you can eat, so I'm not sure why people complain about this. But the server is sweet and informs you up front of this policy. Its simple...Dont order for a small country when you sit, and you should be fine! :) the chefs are not the type to chat and interact. They could definitely afford to take a greeting/smile course to at least forge a friendly demeanor indicating they are happy to have the business. I did not feel as though they dreaded our company either. The chefs just could simply smile more as they walk to and from you to take your order. I think this would change the experience for many that have posted about the lack of service. They were nice men though. I do not think they realize it comes off unfriendly.    The sushi! This was the most important part to us of course. And the reason I and my boyfriend rated it a 3 out of 5 is only because there are small ways in which we noticed a few corners being cut. The sauces seemed a bit different; where eel sauce usually has that dark & silky texture and has its own unique taste....their eel sauce ever-so-slightly has a silky but somewhat applesauce looking texture to it. It also didnt quite taste like eel sauce and it was cold. Just threw us off a bit. The fish overall didnt taste the freshest that we've experienced at some of our favorite sushi dives. But it wasn't Un - edible either. we are fond of rolls with eel sauce so this affected us more only due to our passion for salmon skin rolls. But here we only ordered one. Many of their rolls on the menu are deep fried and/or have cream cheese. The white tuna sushi was amazing! And they have Inari! Which many sushi places don't. The other sushi we ordered the fish wasn't vibrant and fresh looking to be honest, however most of it was pretty good.",

Service was subpar but food was still great. After food arrived, we had to ask 3 times for silverware for the kids. Finally had to stand up and request utensils so my kids could dig into their food instead of just staring at it. Water tasted salty, I asked the server for a new cup and she gave a weird look and stated that they don't put salt in the water. I looked at her and asked for another cup of water. Seemed like I was inconveniencing her. Hope this was just a fluke. Not sure if we'd go back.",

After we exhausted the items limited to one per order the taste and quality diminished.  My family are experienced shusi eaters with large appetites.    At the end, we were scolded by our waitress for leaving the less quality items on our plate.   She basically told us that the boss checked the trash each nite to calculate how much money he was losing.    We ate most of everything served, the only items we left were those dishes which were too ethnic or too fishy.    I told the waitress if she didn't want to upset her boss, she should toss some of the less quality items we left down the garbage disposal.   Was not a very pleasant end to our dinner.    I won't be going back.    That type service ruined our meal.  Also, we had ordered the buy one, get one free Sake.   Beware, it was not good.    We ordered it cold, and waitress argued with us.",

However if your expecting it to come fast, think again. The service is very slow here and not friendly. They take forever to come take your order and don't visit your table very often, so when I ordered from here I would try to get most things I wanted in one visit. However that's not even good enough, like I said before, the food comes out very slow. I have no clue why. Last time I ordered sashimi and some rolls. All my rolls came first and then sashimi last. What's the point in the sashimi if I cant even get that first? Anyway I was here with a friend trying to enjoy the night when I noticed a few people down the table/booth seating quickly get up and whimper. Sure enough I look down  at my seat and there's a cockroach crawling right towards my leg. I got up quickly and started to lightly laugh, even though I was less than pleased. I didn't want to cause more of a scene since the other people were furious. They left without paying. The waitress explained to us that it never happens, and they sprayed that morning. Well if have to spray for bugs.. you must have a problem with it? Anyway, we finished our sushi, and no discount was offered for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I wont be returning.",

Sushi is always really fresh and they have a bunch of different rolls and you can even get the rolls in half orders which is good so you can try more rolls and not get full.",

    "text": "Sushi good, service bad...as in worst I have ever experienced. We love this place, but if you get the owner's wife as your server, go somewhere else.  She is rude, rushes you to order, rushes you to leave, and acts as if she doesn't hear you when you ask a question.  Tonight, after the best server who took our order went home, she came to our table and yelled at us as our five year old was eating a shrimp tempura.  \"You can't eat that. TO THE FIVE YEAR OLD.  We said \"what?\"  She looked at us and said \"rules say no sharing. She can't eat that. You pay. She can't eat that.\"  I replied \"Ok, we'll pay for the kids tempura. No problem.\"  With a continued raised voice and ignoring us saying ok, she goes on enough to upset our 5 year old who dropped the shrimp, started crying, and looked like a criminal.  Keep in mind, we ordered 4 all you can eat meals. And had great service from the young, pleasant, attentive server up to this point.  The owner's wife made an incident over a $4.50 item THAT WE AGREED TO PAY.  As we asked to speak to the manager, the rest of the staff said it's her. We were upset, told her as much, and asked for the check.  Instead, she grabbed the phone and said she was calling the police. I said that was fine, we'll wait for the cops and the check, and see which comes first.  No cops, 15 minutes later, $130 check arrives. Pay and leave. Upset kids, meal spoiled by the owner's wife.   Everybody has a bad day, but she is rude, short and rushes us every time we have been there.  I don't leave negative reviews. I value good service. This woman should not be talking to customers EVER, plain and simple.",

    "text": "This is probably one of the better sushi spots north of Chinatown. Came here the other night with my friend for AYCE sushi dinner. Their selections in rolls are really good and they offer half roll options so you can try different rolls without getting too full. Personal recommendations include the Sweet Dream and Joe's Special. It doesn't get too loud, your able to have a conversation and enjoy yourself. Decor is light/minimal. Just straight up about the food. I did enjoy the quality of food that I got, some AYCE places focus so much on the varying rolls that sometimes it's not rolled tightly or you tell the food itself is not up to par. The price for AYCE Dinner is about average for the area $26.95 (approx.) .   I will come back here instead of making my normal trek down to Chinatown- I'm not fighting traffic, so for that they got an extra star.",

    "text": "Horrible service. We used to frequent this place often. But since we've moved, this was our first visit in a while.   We came in with our 3 nephews for all you can eat, and were treated very unfairly. One of our nephews is 5 years old. We ordered him a kids meal. He ate that and was fine. The other two are 3 year old twins. At any other sushi place we've been to, kids under a certain age are allowed to share with their adults. They're tiny! What's the most they can eat? We were feeding them a bite or two of our rolls, they had a few sips of some ramen. About halfway thru our meal, the manager comes to our table and says the kids are not allowed to eat our food. The menu has reduced pricing for children's AYCE and specifically states Age 4-10. We assumed that meant children 3 and under were okay to share? If not, they would've had a separate price for ages 0-3 right? We pointed that out and he quickly said \"they're 3, the rules are 2 and under\". Didn't make any sense. Nothing on the menu mentions age 2 anywhere?   We were halfway thru our meal so we asked, what we're supposed to do now? None of the other waiters mentioned anything. He said the 3 year olds need to order their own meals.   After he left our table, we pretty much had no service for the rest of our time. The couple orders we were able to flag down took way longer than any of the other tables around us. We were there for about 45 mins after he spoke to us and they only came to our table two times to check on us afterwards. Pretty bad when you're paying for all you can eat?? I get the rules. But don't make them up on the fly and try to enforce them halfway thru. Get it together.",

I have never felt so humiliated,  angered and disappointed than I did when I dined there. I was a frequent visitor to this sushi place because I stayed right down the street. They have my favorite roll, the \"Mt. Charleston\" and they offered salmon belly, which sadly enough, I can't seem to get anywhere else. However, my friend and I ordered AYCE  and I ate my meal and he didn't. It was his first time and he should've just ordered one roll  (our fault) but he had a half roll left over. When it was time to pay, they were slow getting us the check because the OWNER decided to tell us to finish his roll before she could give us a check. Needless to say, things escalated and she was very disrespectful and went as far as to put her hands on me!  She was SO rude and I vowed to NEVER go there again. It's unfortunate for the staff at that place and I just hope she values her employees.  I tipped the staff and I left so upset. I will make it my duty to never direct people to this place again.   Also, the kitchen smells  really bad.",

A little quite for my taste and because the amount of rice each roll has. Each roll tasted great but for someone like me who usually does sashimi and tries to cut carb intake, I wasn't thrilled.

We were greeted immediately upon walking into the restaurant, sat right down at the bar, and were asked immediately what we wanted to order first. Before even finishing the roll in front of our faces, we were asked what we wanted to order next. There were 3 sushi chefs working and they were very quick to finish orders after they were placed. The restaurant was mildly busy for lunchtime on a Saturday. Just to give an example of how quick the service was... We ate at least 5 rolls in about 25 minutes.   It is not a large restaurant. The dining area was clean. No odd smells as previous reviews stated.   Overall, we were in and out with full bellies in about 50 minutes total. Another plus.. They have stamp cards :) It is nice to have a neighborhood sushi restaurant of good quality and service again. Definitely enjoyed our visit-- we will be returning!",

I even tried to strike up small talk but got quickly ignored. Most of the servers at the tables are good, especially during lunch. My wife and I came for dinner one time and had the waitress argue with us as to what came on a specific roll... We have been many times in the last year (I think I completed 3 loyalty cards).. so I am familiar with what is normally on their rolls. My wife has a few favorites and they threw extras that didn't belong... the general good quality is good, and with it being so close, I will continue to go... but the initial amazement is gone...",

    "text": "Not good!  We had lunch here this past Saturday afternoon.  One of our servers was painfully rude.  We did AYCE and ordered a spider roll - the crab tasted old and like spoiled oil and we told them.  They didn't care just reminded us of the 'rules' for AYCE.  We did eat it - swallowed it all and left 1/2 a piece on the plate as we just could not stomach it.  We ordered some other items - a few of them did not come and others took forever and did not taste good.  The server was soooo rude and when we asked to pay - she held our credit card hostage until we ate every last piece of food .... which was 2 pieces of one roll left on the table. There are other places in the area that deserve your business - this is not one of them.  Shame on you Krazy Sushi - at least you live up to your name!",

    "text": "The reviews for this place are extremely hit or miss it appears, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  That's where the problem started.   I called in an order tonight of their Miso Ramen Soup and a California Roll (nothing too complicated) and was told it would take over 25 minutes, which I thought was alot for soup, pre-made noodles and a sushi roll.  Again, still giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Came down to the restaurant, no close parks as Starbucks completely owns that parking lot apparently.  Got into the restaurant, appeared to be less than full, and was greated and asked for my to-go order.  So here's my issue, she gives me the bill, I put in $15 (it was $14 and some change) and she gives me a strange look and asks me if I want my change?  I ask her, \"why do I have to give you a tip for simply ringing up my to-go order?\"  She just stood there, starring at me, so I gave her another dollar and asked, yet again, can I have my food now?   She went to ring up the ticket across the resteraunt, noticing another woman nearby asking servers to take her bill for payment but no one noticed her until she started yelling across the resteraunt.  Then I turn back, and see the waitress who took my money, take the change, and put it into their \"tip jar\" on the sushi bar and walk away, starting to take orders at other tables.  Now, I'm pissed....not only did I give this idiot a tip, now she's racist because I called her out on her greedy-ass and she visually removed me from her mind as I started shouting at a server, give me my f*cking food now....he asked who was helping me, I point to the woman and he brings her over and she greets me like its the first time she's met me.  I had to demand for my food, and give a tip just to be ignored by the wait staff here entirely.  The food was mediocre at best, and this place needs to stay out of  business as the owners should not be working in the service industry if this is the quality of the staff they hire and allow to manage their day to day.  I never really noticed if this was a racist thing (myself being white and funny enough the other paitron who had to yell to pay their bill, was also white), as the other tables this woman began to assist were ALL of Asian descent, and she was able to forgot about me and my order, all in the span of less than 2 minutes.  Stay away from this place if your white, as your service will be sh*t.  If your not white, it appears they welcome you in with open arms.",

However, krazy sushi is right down the street and we were hungry. We ordered the screaming orgasm and tuna poke. They were alright, but definitely not the best I've had. My husband ordered a few rolls and they were not good at all. The pink lady was completely soaked in ponzu sauce to where the rice was all brown. Their eel sauce was not the right flavor or consistency at all and their fish was not fresh. I was still hungry and annoyed that we definitely hadn't gotten our money's worth for AYCE, so I found a roll that I thought I might like. I asked if they could add shrimp tempera to it and she cut me off in the middle of my sentence to say that they only do \"customization\" on the a la carte menu. I've personally never heard of any other sushi place that has a policy like this. She said she'd do it this time only. I should have just quit while I was ahead because that roll sucked too. Then we got dessert. I got the mango mochi and my husband got the coffee flavor. The mango mochi was terrible. It literally tasted like perfume. All in all it was a bad experience and a waste of $65. We will not be back no matter how close it is to our house.",

On my first visit when they first opened, I didn't really enjoy the food, and despite me not giving up on it, each visit after that never really improved.  I think I only kept going back because they had the lunch specials and had a couple nice servers, but no more of that.  It's only AYCE and a la carte and where's the good service?  I finally came to the realization after my meal today that they just will never attain the level of deliciousness that Sushi Loca has established.   Fails: 1.  The miso soup sucks every time.  It's watered down.  How do you mess up miso soup?! 2.  Their california rolls sucks.  Gross sticks of imitation crab meat.  How do you mess up california rolls? 3.  The spider rolls is gross.  How do you mess up deep fried goodness? 4.  Maybe it serves me right for being a glutton but they charge you for food that you have left over.  (I got charged for 1 full roll because we didn't finish two different half rolls) At least we got to take it home =P  Conclusion:  They are consistent, consistent in making yucky sushi.",

We ended up paying $62 dlls for the four sushi rolls, if we would of driven 5 more minutes we could have gone to Unami sushi restaurant, which is better quality and their ramen is actually pretty tasty. We don't recommend this place at all. The staff has no clue of what they're doing, we were tucked in a enclose table and our server went MIA. Sushi rolls kept coming to us but belonged to different tables. Not a good experience. Never again will we eat there and we don't recommend it at all.",

My husband and I frequent this location quite often (we've been at LEAST 25 times) and love the cards for the AYCE buy 10 get one free deal. The servers are always super sweet and very attentive. But this last time we went my husband and I both felt like a lot had changed in regards to the food quality and quantity (quantity not being a big deal if you get the all you can eat, just order more). The fried gyoza seemed a bit off from what we were used to, way more crispy, like they were either fried in a deep fryer and not by pan, or they had switched vendors and bought a different type of gyoza, so we weren't a fan of them. Also it seemed the spicy tuna rolls were made with much less tuna this time and more rice. The screaming honey roll seemed to have a different sauce as well, it had more of a vinegar-y taste to it than usual. My beef bugolgi was mostly burnt, and lacking the \"bulgogi taste\" it normally has. Lastly, it seems that they cut down on portion size on some of the rolls, but as I previously stated, not a big deal if you get the all you can eat. I am sad to say this, but we weren't impressed with the food the last time we went, but I can not stress enough the waitresses are always very sweet and super attentive. I hope that this visit was just a fluke and they didn't really change a bunch of things. This was my favorite place to eat in the local area!",

I knew it wasn't high end make me do my happy dance with every bite type of sushi...I just was hoping for a decent place to grab a quick bite of sushi for those lazy nights I don't feel like cooking or driving.   Well, I had one of those nights and ventured into this place to fill that sushi craving. We ordered some standard spicy tuna with garlic sauce over it type stuff and a couple of deep fried sushi since thats my best buds favorite stuff. The spicy tuna roll was okay, not doing my happy dance but I'm okay with it. The deep fried stuff was just plain gross :-/ I swear they used canned tuna and canned salmon in the middle of that roll. It was completely cooked inside with barely any rice in the actual roll. I wasn't looking for the cats meow of sushi but yet I wasn't too please to get the deep fried cat food they called sushi :-/",

Again, I think part of the problem was the fact that they may have been there at a busy time of the day. The food was great, the service was great, and the food came out fast. I loved it and it's hard for me to like a sushi place that I like. Even though I live far from there, I'm willing to drive the distance for the food.",

I just thought I'd mention it, because we've come to assume that of sushi places here in Vegas and were a little surprised to find out that wasn't the case here.  Now to the real review:  The restaurant looks nice and the staff are fast and friendly. but they seem to forget little things. My husband got some sushi, and with it, came the usual pickled ginger, but no wasabi. Hmm... No big deal. Our drinks weren't refilled either without us asking. The food however was quite tasty and beautifully plated and also didn't take too long to come out of the kitchen. All in all it was a good experience, but it was a little costly compared to what we're used to here in vegas.",

The sushi was MUCH better and the restaurant had a better atmosphere. I've been to many All You Can Eat sushi places, and I understand that sometimes quality takes a hit when restaurants change to this type of dining experience, but it went down drastically. It is definitely overpriced, one AYCE after tax was $30. I've been to better places like Nagoya/Nagoya 2 and Sumo Sushi 2 that used to be a la carte and are now AYCE and their quality is still in tact at a lower price.   Overall, I'd say skip this place and find another AYCE joint. This place is minutes from my house, but I usually go to the other side of town for some good sushi.",

Figured, what the crap. why not? Lets try it! Stopped in around 1ish. Had costumers in, and decided to sit at the sushi bar. Greeted by our awesome waitress who took our alcohol order. (I don't believe in soda at sushi bars). Looked through the menu and was surprised at what it consisted of. Ordered numerous sashimi plates and numerous rolls. And not to forget the sake as well. The first bottle I ordered was my typical sake, cant remember the name, but its the same I always order. Took the chefs recommendation on sake and was please.  Oh, and the food? Amazing. Fish was super good, super fresh, super fast. The owner, who was our chef at the time was super friendly, chatted with us the entire time, told us how he was hung over. It was great.   And to be honest, this is 2nd best sushi Ive ever had. No complaints what so ever. Possibly the fact that maybe they don't have a happy hour? But then again I live 290 miles from this place and it really doesn't matter.   I hope nothing but the best for this business. and Esp for the owner who was amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better sushi experience   For the record, my super picky sister even loved it. And that says a lot.   Sushi-Ko, look out, theres some new competition in Vegas.",

    "text": "A popular type of dining experience in Las Vegas is all you can eat sushi. Similar to gas stations, these styles of restaurants are found in most plazas. I find that in this day and age, people are looking for the quantity of food as well as the quality. Kindly enough, the Japanese introduced this lovely eating innovation. Krazy Sushi is a restaurant that I am extremely fond of and a food that I constantly crave. In order for a sushi bar and restaurant to generate business, one must possess certain qualities. The qualities of this specific restaurant are the reasons why I continue to choose this tasteful art as my occasional dinner.        When walking into any restaurant, I have certain expectations of comfort that I wish to feel. The characteristics that I look for while eating out lie in the smallest of details, which really create an overall tone for any restaurant.  I take in the color of the walls, the decor, the style of seating, how the lighting is, as well as the first impression I acquire. My father is an interior designer, so I am familiar with this insight and have adopted a creative perception that can be analytical in judging any atmosphere. The general sense I have when I arrive in this restaurant is comfort and relaxation. Each secluded booth is designed with bamboo. Within each individual booth there are modern single hanging lights directly over your table that illuminates the table entirely, creating a feeling of intimacy.  This is a very inviting setting because I have an overall sense of connection to the atmosphere as well as the people that I am sharing the meal with.        At any type of restaurant or business costumer service is key. Costumer service is really what ties any outing together; it allows human connection to create comfort and overall form a fun experience. Although each server is different,  in any restaurant I always appreciate a smiling face and a patient individual who is guiding me on my eating extravaganza. Granted, not everyone is always having the best day possible; but it does reflect on what the meal is going to present itself as. The employees at Krazy Sushi are warm and extremely welcoming; with the occasional dry personalities here and there. One of my favorite aspects of this restaurant is when entering the front door; each employee greets the approaching guest shouting, \"Irasshaimase\", meaning welcome in Japanese. In my eyes, this acknowledgement creates a sense of kinship.  I automatically feel as welcome as they are demanding I feel. The servers are generally happy and enjoy their job, which radiates into their kindness.        It is a little peculiar to think about how Las Vegas is able to constantly maintain a large supply of fresh fish. We live in a desert for crying out loud. With that being said, there are so many restaurants of its kind; which means, finding fresh fish is not always the easiest. Growing up, my parents conditioned me to eating sushi on a regular basis. Throughout my life, I have had experiences a lot of places where their fish is dried out, dully colored and smells a little funny. Needless to say, those are not the places that I chose to eat at any longer. However, the fish at Krazy Sushi is perfect. The pieces of fish are thickly sliced and the chefs are not shy in distribution. Each bite I indulge in forces me to close my eyes in complete satisfaction until its exotic flavors are swallowed. My taste buds are always grateful to be spoiled with such decadent fish, not to mention the elegant presentation that is delivered with each plate through art.         Overall, Krazy Sushi is a lovely dining experience. It remains my sushi of preference and I continue to encourage anyone who is open to eating bizarre types of food to live this experience for themselves. The Atmosphere is authentic, the costumer service is welcoming and the food is well worth the money spent. For an all you can eat restaurant, you might be grateful you chose this particular establishment to completely satisfy your cravings and leave your stomach full to its capacity.",

Since the beginning of the year though we notice a significant change in the vibe of our favorite sushi restaurant.  The food started to be more good and never great.  The servers who made our nights fun were gone; replaced by a brigade of food schlepers.  Worst of all, the decor went from a quaint experience to a video wall extravaganza that was better suited for East Freemont than Centennial.    Even with that, we wouldn't give this a 1 star or write a review about never going back.  Not until our LAST visit.  They changed the menu without changing the names of the rolls.  They continued to send item after item to our table that we didn't order, but didn't get items we actually ordered.  And to put a creamy dreamy topper on our craptastic experience last night: we both got food poisoning.   We didn't make it half a mile from the restaurant before having to yank the wheel, dart out of the car, and spend 5 minutes giving back to the world.  Thank you Krazy Sushi.  You lost two loyal customers.  You ruined our date night.  Hopefully we will be able to enjoy sushi again from a place that knows the difference between fresh product and spoiled product.  May Gordon Ramsey show up with a video crew and show the world what really happens there.  Maybe he can find out what that smell is!",

Late service, conditions of the restaurant was bad. And yesterday I walked in STARVING and the smell of that restaurant made me sick. Literally smelled like shit, sulfur, and rotten eggs. Like the gas stations in the middle of no where. Disgraceful of a restaurant.",

And spicy ahi too. And tako! The only thing I didn't care for was the yakitori, yakiniku and yakiebi. Maybe it was the sauce; I'm not sure. But I enjoyed all the sushi.  This time I ordered half rolls instead of full size. That was a good move, since I got to try a lot more items before filling up.  Mochi ice cream was good too! Mango is da bess!",

    "text": "We were customers here for 5+ years, but today we will no longer be going here.   The waitress we had did not give us the usual Krazy Sushi service. She was a white blonde girl who worked this afternoon. We're used to the fast, great service that they usually have but she was very slow. We never had to wait to be seated before, even when it was busy unlike today (it was not very busy at all). We had to wait a while, then when we weren't greeted by a hostess/waitress we thought it would be best to just seat ourselves, so we did until the waitress finally approached us and said we couldn't sit in the area we chose. Okay, no problem, we'll sit where she puts us.   We got our food on time, but then this waitress was very off. I asked her about the appetizers that came with the all you can eat, and so I chose one for my daughter. The tempura shrimp said it had 3 pieces included, and we only got 2. I asked her about it and she asked if I wanted it a la cart instead? She said the ones with the A next to it meant a la carte, but the tempura shrimp didn't have an A next to it... then she told me it did. Okay... So is my daughter getting three pieces or what because I'm confused. I didn't know that if you chose all you can eat then you only get two pieces of shrimp tempura. Why didn't the waitress clarify that? How am I supposed to know all these rules without being told what they are? I had to Google this info while I was at the restaurant because she wouldn't check up on us the way the old servers do + she didn't tell me what she meant by making it a la carte.   I asked for green tea ice cream for my daughter and she forgot it twice. I gave a sigh after I called for her but she didn't hear me.   Another patron, let's call her Karen with the typical 'I need to speak with your manager' haircut and her husband from Duck Dynasty gave me a snippy look afterwards. Karen over there spoke loudly to the blonde waitress implying that I was rude. Then the blonde waitress just leans over and is whispering along with Karen and her Duck Dynasty ass husband about me sighing about her ignoring me. Girl, I just wanted the service I was used to having at Krazy Sushi and you were not giving it! Why waste time leaning over to talk crap with Karen and lessen your tip amount instead of assessing the problem?   The sushi is great and the workers who have been there have been especially wonderful, obviously minus the blonde. Today made me hate that place. If anyone wants a stamp card with 4 stamps on it hit me up 'cause I am not eating here anymore.  Please train your new hires better. Otherwise this place would be perfect just as it was before!",

Service is nice enough, I dont expect much it's not fine dining. I'd reccomend checking it out if you're in the area.

You can't go wrong with the Vampire roll and the pepper tuna sashimi...the volcano will fill you up quick and is very rich. They were out of Asahi and Hite which was a little bummer but the Ichiban sufficed. Five stars because everyone was so nice and food met expectations.  Gina was our server and she was super!

They have K-Pop playing on the tv which my kid enjoys watching while she eats. They do offer trainers for those attempting to learn traditional art of sushi eating. Our server greeted us immediately and got our drink orders, a minute later another server came to ask for our drinks so I informed him someone else got it. When she came back with our drinks I gave her my daughters order tuna handroll so she can start eating. After a few minutes she came to take my order and as soon as she left my daughters sushi was dropped. I was amazed at how quick it was. And even more astonished at the freshness of the tuna. It was like butter in my mouth. I color was a hearty glistening deep maroon. I only ate the fish out of a couple and she took care of the rice and nori. My orders came out in record time too and so fulfilling that I couldn't even finish them. I order the rainbow roll and shrimp lover and both were more than I bargained for.  As for service - I love how all the staff walked around ensuring you're having a delightful experience. There was a constant table check which I appreciate.   Price was not that bad and in comparison with other places it was average. They do offer AYCE so if you're in the Centennial area by Centennial Hospital you should definitely stop by here.",

Upon entry we were greeted warmly and seated immediately, a young polite gentleman helped us with our drink order, explained the menu and also helped us with suggestions.  The waitress was really nice, the food was good, the fish was fresh, the house sake was amazing! (also only 1.00 per bottle with AYCE) the large menu is also impressive, and the service was friendly and prompt without making us feel rushed. Years ago we tried this place but didn't care for it, so glad we gave it a second try! Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I've said this before but I'll say it again: this is by far the best sushi restaurant I've been to. Even though I rarely go now and haven't been in quite some time (~ a year ago), the quality of the food and service has remained high! I'm still surprised by the fact that they're an AYCE sushi restaurant but still serve such fresh fish. I'm a pretty consistent eater in that I'll tend to stick with items that I know I like. But last Wednesday when I went (sadly been too busy to write this), I decided to try a couple of new things out. I put up the pictures of the most memorable ones and damn were they good. I'm not a big fan of garlic, but the garlic tuna was surprisingly good! I was also lucky enough to be there when they got their shipment of blue fin tuna. You can see it in the photos I took, but they don't really do it justice. The fish was HUGE! This was an insane experience, I've never seen anything like it. I've especially never seen someone carve up a whole fish right in front of me. I highly recommend coming here (especially on Wednesdays if you want to experience what I did with the fish :)). It's a great price, and when factoring in the quality of the food itself, incomparable to any other place I've been. If you're looking for high quality AND quantity, this is the place you want to go.",

Service was good, and the place was always 3/4 full. Now the entire place changed. The servers got rude with me when I didn't want to order AYCE. I guess cuz now they have to serve me instead of the chef. I ordered ice tea, and the server comes back with Raspberry Iced Tea. I told her I wanted green tea, because I didn't know there was a choice, and she gave a me a look that it was way outta her way. The best part was when the server wasn't paying attention, I took my phone out to text, and I guess she thought I was taking pix and yelping cuz her 'tude changed from nite-n-day. When the bill came I saw I was charged for 2 iced tea and 2 miso...I didn't argue...I just wanted to leave :(  Maybe their AYCE is a great deal, but when it comes for Japanese food it's not the place to go to.",

I walked in, and was instantly seated(It was totally empty). I was with two other people. I ordered the Philadelphia roll, and the California roll. My friends ordered the spicy salmon. Just a little to spicy for me(although I can handle Sriracha). Or first order took about 10 minutes to arrive at the table. My second order(California roll) took less than 5 minutes to be served. The only thing that totally made me mad was the fact that they charge $2.50 per cup for tea. So If you order a pot of tea, they don't charge for the pot. They charge you by how many tea cups are given to the members of your party. The all you can eat is a great deal. Except for the fact that you have to order your rolls with in 45 min(for lunch) and 1 hour(dinner&late night). And you have to finish one, before you order the next. Otherwise everything was great, and I'll totally return!",

I'm usually a very picky eater but i can always find great things on the menu. Service is great too, our waitress is always very friendly.

I didn't get around to trying nigiri simply because I was so amazed by all the special rolls. It is a bit pricey but I believe VERY worth it. For those not near the area, it is also very worth the drive. Favorites include the Vampire, Volcano, Something Wrong #69, Krazy Sushi Burrito, and Mistake Roll.

Save your money or go somewhere else.

After entering and being very warmly greeted and seated, We were told they will be offering 50-20 % off the bill for the next couple weeks. We were like kids in a candy store!!! We usually don't sit at the sushi bar, this time we decided to. My husband was very excited about the menu!! I on the other hand only eat cooked rolls, and i wasn't so please with my options. But after looking over the menu a couple more times I saw a couple things i might enjoy. OMG!!!!!!!!! Watching Johnny ( The owner \\ Sushi Chef) make these dishes we couldn't wait to get our food. My husband's belly was full and he wanted more. He knew right away we needed to take pictures of the food and send them to our friends in cali. Our friends love more than anything coming to Vegas and going to Sushi KO, So we knew if they loved Sushi Ko they would love Krazy Sushi. We were right! They came out 2 weeks ago and agreed after eating awesome sushi, drinking 2 bottles of sake and chatting with Johnny it was at least just as good as Sushi Ko.  WORTH THE DRIVE TO THE NORTH SIDE.",

A few reminders to those that call themselves a sushi restaurant:  `Cook your rice-crunchy white rice is not acceptable! `Use fish that actually resembles fish. Not same defrosted pinkish looking, tough to chew piece of protien on top of a bed of under-cooked rice.      `No wasabi under this piece of protien. `Deep frying in 4 week old oil.  There is a reason why wthis place has so many 1 sta r reviews-the food sucks-period! More like Krazy Sick in the head for trying it.

I was completely ignored by the one waiter as other people came in and had to gesture at him from across the room to get my water a half hour later. Got home and the sushi looked nice except for some grey, room temperature fish on top of one of the rolls. It got worse when I tasted it. All bland, all five different types of rolls tasted basically the same. Ick. Will not be spending my hard earned money there again.",

We ordered the eat-all-you-can. The lady was busy. It took a while for us to get the service. The food was okay. It didn't impress me though. I like the Sushi Twister in Henderson. We just tried Krazy Sushi for a changed and just so we would know if it's a good place to eat.   The regular salad was okay. The miso soup was okay. I like the mochi ice cream. I liked their regular rolls but I was not impressed by it.",

The reason that's relevant is because she lost her ring and we got her a new one. And I wanted to surprise her. So I called here asking what they could do. And I later went in and we got a plan of action. I didn't give them much time because we were eating in an hour but they reserved a table for us to sit. Very friendly staff. I spoke with a girl named Julah who served on us. She is a class act. They need to give her a raise. Very funny and personable. I spoke with Ryan on what we could do food wise and he was very respectful and willing to help. Very kind. There was a guy Pablo next to him I didn't speak to but I'm sure he helped as well. Food comes out fast as usual. Julah was very attentive. Everything was first class. I recommend this place to anyone! We will be back of course.",

The accuracy and speed of whatever dish I order is always correct and delicious. All the workers seem to get along pretty well and no matter how busy it is there, everyone always shows a sense of urgency and they know very well how to work together. Krazy Sushi was the first place I ever tried sushi at and I plan on returning more often. The management does a really good job in working with the rest of the crew and Josue is a True masterchef: that gentleman really knows how to do his job well and is proficient with handling sushi. Keep up the GREAT & AMAZING WORK GUYS! Krazy Sushi is one of the BEST authentic sushi restaurants to eat at!",

It was quiet for lunch time and we were able to choose our seat and chose one of the hidden booths in the back. Maybe they were prepping but there was a really rotten smell that filled the restaurant and you could just tell, everything was dirty. That's an instant red flag to me. Our table and booth were completely sticky and the small circular dishes the provide on the table still had some rice residue on them.   AYCE pricing is not bad, $20 a person if I remember correctly. But I was so turned off by the smell and overall appearance of the place, I wasn't looking forward to eating any raw fish from here.  I ordered a few california rolls and they weren't bad at all. My husband ordered a variety of rolls and enjoyed them all.   You can't really mess up a cali roll and though my husband enjoyed the food, we won't be back. There's just something to me about eating in a clean environment.   Taking recommendations for a better sushi place that has AYCE in the northwest.",

That was great for us because all of our food came out quickly. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.   All you can eat sushi for lunch is around $22. It's a good deal if you're ordering two or more rolls or want to order appetizers. All you can eat includes desserts too. They offer quite a few Bento Box options that I'd love to try on a future visit.  The Popcorn Lobster Roll was my favorite and covered in several delicious sauces. Lemon on sushi is my favorite so I really liked the Lemon Meet Salmon too. Also yummy was the Gangnam Roll, Shrimp Tempura, Vegetable Tempura, House Salad, and Fried Gyoza.   For dessert the Green Tea Ice Cream had a good flavor without being overpowering and a nice creamy texture. The Honey Toast was actually a Hawaiian Roll covered in honey which is definitely not traditional so I'd pass on this next time.  Overall, I was happy with my experience and will return if I'm in the area again.",

It just took a while to get our checks and get them paid. We sat up at the bar for lunch and the sushi chefs were great, they talked with us and laughed with us and got our food quickly and on time. Something very different was the chefs were all Hispanic and not Asian, not something I think I've ever seen at a sushi joint.   I actually thought the fish was all very fresh, it was a Saturday noon so I'm not sure when they get their fish orders. My biggest disappointment was the baked green mussels. They were a little fishy tasting and you can only order one per person, I usually get like 4 orders for myself at other places.",

I ordered hamachi kama, dancing with eel roll, regular salmon roll then salmon belly and masago sushi.  I also ordered a crab salad on the side.   The hamachi was beautifully baked with lots of meat.  The dancing with eel roll looked a little off at first... the sauce looked dried out and old... but after tasting it, it was ok.  Just wasn't appealing to the eye.  They had put my salmon roll along with the dancing eel roll... ummm, no.  The eel sauce got onto my salmon and that was not cool.  The salmon roll was pretty big and worth the price tag.  Now the star of the dinner was the salmon belly... so silky and soft... next time I'm ordering 2 orders of it!  I used the masago for something I put together myself... salmon roll with crab salad on top and then the masago... so yummy!  I follow them on IG so I know they usually get blue fin tuna on Wednesday's.  I'll have to dine in and check out some of their other goodies.",

And, on top of the fact they're speedy, the food is delicious.  Krazy Sushi has a wide selection of exotic rolls and sashimi, and things are included here in the AYCE menu that aren't at most other places.    Krazy Sushi is in a commercial center with ample well lit parking.  The staff is super friendly and they also have a rewards card that allows a free meal after 10 paid meals.    The establishment is clean and well lit inside as well.  They also offer $1 Sake with the AYCE menu.    In short, I've yet to have a bad experience here.  I've tried a lot of sushi places in the northwest, this place is the best in my opinion.",

Ive never been to an AYCE where that's not the case so it's not a scam!  the service can be a little slow at times if they are busy but that's standard anywhere. The servers are always super nice. I LOVE they have half rolls so you can try more and not get stuck with uneaten rolls. The sushi (yellowtail and ahi tuna) is always fresh and delicious. The screaming o and beef bulgogi are amazing. Heading here for my birthday celebration next week and can't wait!!",

We use to drive all the way across town for good sushi (now impossible with kids) a friend recommended we try Krazy Sushi , and I'm glad I listened.   The fish here is top notch , I recommend all the Nigiri (included in AYCE) my favorite is definitely the tuna and the salmon. The fish is fresh and nice size pices well presented.   My wife and I enjoy several of the rolls also top favorite are something wrong, and crazy samurai, both rolls are filled with flavor but dont over do it. Every time I go I always get a Philadelphia it is a great basic roll (I could eat 10 orders ) but even thoe its a basic roll they still do a great job you can tell the same attention to detail on fancy rolls as basic rolls(some sushi joints just toss basic rolls together with no care ) .   So if your in the Centennial Hills area and craving sushi for lunch or dinner I recommend Krazy Sushi , good food , good service , good price !!",

I have been coming to this place since it opened as I have lived in the area for about 9 years.  I have given in like 5-7 more chances, even subtly, and courteously letting them know and still no change.  service is slow, they forget to come to me. they orders are always lacking, the scallop sushi always comes out tasting different, uni is hit or miss - sometimes good and sometimes old.. last time i got one roll ala carte and said you know what maybe i will do ayce instead.. (you know spend more money!)  and the owner said no, you can't you already said ala carte.  So I checked out, and left a note, - yup that was me. And I will probably not come back unless there is no other sushi option.    I was a regular.  There 2-3 times per month, the whole family. Sometimes I went once a week.. If i am not here, i make my own sushi at home. Japanese food is part of my regular diet. I bring other people there, i celebrate there, for YEARS.    I am so disappointed that I have to stop going there. You don't value me is a customer, then I am not giving you my business. I hope you learn your lesson. BE NICER to your customers!  Go to Umami.  Sushi Ko on Craig, Geisha house is opening on Oso Blanca, and Sushi Loca on Centennial. So disappointed I had to finally leave my go-to place.",

    "text": "So was up in the Northwest part of the valley today and decided to stop in at a place I liked when I lived up there. Hey when you got the craving,  might as well give in and Krazy Sushi took care of that a  Food- I got 3 different rolls, one baked and other 2 just normal rolls. As normal I was not disappointed as the quality and taste were on point. There selection was large, but could be difficult to understand their rules (more on that later.   Restaurant - I think it has great seating options, it was busy when I was there but didn't seem like that was a problem as the staff at Krazy Sushi are all over it. They even have 3 places to sit in a semi private table, kinda like a enclave.   Staff - As I mentioned never have had a problem, always been nice to me and I have never really waited. I usually sit at a table but today wanted to try the bar to compare, and will say felt like I was not ignored.  Why not 5 stars then, well again even thou I have been there before, I was having issues gettin back in that saddle with their all you can eat rules vs. ala carte, but once you read over it, should not be a problem. Also, I mentioned good service, was not ignored, but felt like at times, I was bing slightly rushed by one of the guys behind the counter.   Regardless, when in the neighborhood I will stop in as much as possible if the sushi bug hits me",

This evening marks the reason we will never go back to this location. ***This business offers a \"reward\" card for the AYCE and after ten paid stamps you can redeem for a free meal. Well this evening we would've redeemed the tenth one and since we had six diners we wanted to use it towards one meal. Well this is not the case. We were told you had to come on the next visit, okay I understand your \"policy\" but my stamps also expire the following day. We asked if it could be extended or to just use it toward this evening but the manager INSISTED that was policy and rules are rules. We were also advised we can come back the following day. Well why would we dine again if you don't want to honor our stamp card or even extend the expiration date since we are spending $160 on dinner.  It's very unfortunate that we will no longer dine at this place although it is minutes from our home and you are \"catering\" to the locals. Shame on you!  If the manager does not care to make relationships or have good standings with their frequent diners I doubt they will even bother to change their \"rules\" or outlook on customer service.",

I ordered the  sashimi platter and the mackerel sashimi with a side of steamed rice.  My wife ordered the japanese lasagna with a spicy tuna hand roll and a side of edamame.  First off, the cocaine platter was good.  It had some radish grated to make something similar to pasta that was interesting.  The edamame was pretty much the same as everywhere else, hard to mess that one up.  The good ends there.  They only put out the low sodium soy sauce on the tables (Maybe they were out of the regular stuff?).  The rice was all dry and crunchy across the board, especially on the japanese lasagna which is baked.  I love japanese lasagna normally (Give Sushi-Ko a try, theirs is excellent and it's right down the street) but this one was way too sweet and the sauce just wasn't on par with the offerings from other places.  Despite ordering the mackerel sashimi, they brought the sushi one.  The fish itself was good but the dry crunchy rice ruined that one just like everything else.  The spicy tuna hand roll was a bit bland and not very spicy compared to what I've had elsewhere.  A few moments after we finished eating my wife started not feeling well and threw everything up when we got home.  It was probably the japanese lasagna that caused it because she ate most of it and I only had a bite.  We will not be returning.",

The whole time we were eating, the waitress who wasn't the original one that first started waiting on us was eyeballing our kids to make sure they didn't touch any of the items we ordered from the AYCE. Eventually I got tired of her looking at my daughter and I told her not to worry that I would tell my daughter not to touch any of our food. Of course at the end when we got our bill they charged us for the shrimp tempura that my daughter was looking at earlier. I will never come back here and to imagine all the competition in Vegas you would think you would treat your customers with a little bit more respect and not make them feel uncomfortable when they're eating especially when they have their children. We ended up spending over $120 there and the food was not all that great, it took a very long time for us to get our rolls, and we never got the calamari that we ordered 4 times. Spend your money somewhere else!!!",

The prices are very reasonable and the quality is on par with some of the mid to high end sushi places on the strip.  The staff is great as well.  The only thing personally that keeps me from 5 starring this place is that 80% of the menu has crab in it and I'm just not a fan, BUT...the roll menu is by far the most creative I've seen so do not hesitate to give it a try.  My best suggestion however, pick a roll and put the menu down immediately, otherwise you will change your mind 10 times the further you go into it.  All in all, very worth the trip",

We ordered some rolls and chicken yakisoba, and started off with miso soup. It came out cold. Also, the server forgot to give us chopsticks or spoons......though she was very gracious once we flagged her down.  The yakisoba was really greasy, and the vegetables were soggy. The sauce had a mysterious sweet flavor (anise?) that really didn't work. And, the rolls were terrible as well. We had a Rainbow Roll....I can't remember the others, but the rice was overcooked, and the fish didn't taste fresh at all.   Will not be returning!",

They told us we couldn't order everything we wanted right away because of quality issues.  Then they didn't come back to take our order until we were almost out of time.  The staff was somewhat friendly but clearly on a slow day like the day we were there you would think that getting a waiter or waitress to help you wouldn't be an issue.",

Americanized sushi is a crime against humanity.  Out of the 35 or so specialty rolls offered, almost all of them were deep fried, soaked in sugary sauce, or drenched in mayo.  Ick.  Don't you people want to taste your fish?  Apparently not.  Fish quality was poor.  My squid nigiri was GRILLED for some unknown reason, and swimming in lemon juice.  Scallop nigiri was given the same treatment.    I forget what hand roll I ended up ordering, but it came with so much chili oil on it that grease ran down my chin when i took a bite.    I will not be back.  Oh yeah, it's also pretty pricey.  For what I spent on my dinner there, I could have gone to my favourite all you can eat place (Sushi Kaya) TWICE.  Do not bother with this one.",

I guess I am just high maintenance but they always used to put the good toro Tuna on top.   Since they have AYCE my pink ladies just dont taste the same I want to go back to the days were I just pay 12.95 a pink lady and let my taste buds be in heaven.    The waiter was fast and brought out my orders fast with the AYCE but she sure let me know that you have to eat everything on your plate or they will charge you for the roll.  I think thats why they itemize what you order on the receipt.    I just have a hard time giving a high rating to a restaurant that sacrifices quality for AYCE.  Even if something is AYCE and just doesnt taste good its not really a bargain.",

To my disappointment they did not offer it. It was cheaper to just get the all you can eat vs ala cart. The food was decent i must admit but my fav thing on there menue was there sushi burrito. That was by far the best thing i ate here. Im not quite sure what there busy hours are as i went on a saturday around 11am so not much of a crowd. There is an abundance of parking as well. Prices are a little on the high end if you do ala cart but once you order 3-4 items youve already paid more then the all you can eat price so your better off getting the all you can eat. If your on that side of town its def worth a stop in to check it out.",

It smelled like a strong lemon scent from the floors just being mopped. Why didn't they mop the floors before opening so the diners wouldn't have to smell lemon chemicals as their eating? Next, we were a party of 4 and they only had a napkin with chopsticks for two @ the table and the server NEVER thought to bring us two more napkins and chopsticks. (ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS?) We asked twice for extra forks and chopsticks, 20 minutes after being sat we finally got them. The food came out one by one instead of all of the food coming out at the same time. If it takes 25 minutes for al carte teriyaki dishes to leave the kitchen, then wait on putting in the sushi order!!!! We had half of our party FINISH their dinner before the other half got their food. So we just sat there hungry watching our friends eat. Lastly, I ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was all DARK meat.... No clarification on it being white or dark on the menu, I just assumed it was white because this isn't some 6 dollar hawaiian barbecue restaurant. I was paying 12 dollars for some cheap dark meat that I could have got at a hawaiian spot for 6. Almost forgot to mention the rice stuck on the menus. The service here is horrible and the food is mediocre. I highly advise all of you to stay away.",

The people who saw the thing first left without paying.  I'm inclined to halfway believe the expaination the waitress gave for the cockroach making an appearance but combined with my experience and the fact that no apology or discount was given for in incident, I will not be returning.",

Well, we finally did and I was content with the choice.  The biggest draw to this place is it's neon signage, it is Vegas, so you'd come to expect that neon is just part of the facade.  Secondly, for a month or so they have been offering AYCE sushi which is great in my opinion, I could try all of the sushi I want and not worry about the hefty price tag at the end of the meal.    The rolls themselves are pretty standard for a Vegas sushi joint.  Fairly extensive menu but nothing that you haven't tried already if you're a sushi connosieur.  Aside from the Screaming Orgasm, TNT Roll and Pink Lady (frickin delicious), nothing else really struck my fancy.    Some things to note would be unlike other sushi spots, half-rolls can't be ordered until the final order and keep your ears wide open as \"engrish\" runs rampant here.  All in all, a good spot to eat, but Sushi-Mon still tops it in my eyes.",

My server was very friendly and polite, and checked back regularly to make sure I was doing fine.  The sushi is pretty much on par with what you will find at any AYCE sushi place - I found it to be similar to the AYCE places I had gone to in NJ.  They serve you one roll at a time, so you really can't mix up your taste experience though.  When my waitress found out I was there alone on my birthday, she brought out a small ice cream with a candle in it and had the chef staff sing Happy Birthday to me.

Needless to say, we had to keep refusing rolls.  If not for enjoying being with my husband, this meal would have been a total loss!!!!!!",

As soon as they serve the first batch of the nigiri sushi that we ordered, I notice the huge amount of sushi rice that they gave us. So thinking that since we're Regulars maybe I should bring it to their attention so they can do something about it for us and for their other customers but instead of trying to please the guest, the New Sushi chef that they have thought that since we're asking for small amount of rice on the nigiris it will be funny to reduce the size of the fish as well! So to make it short we got Half of the size of a regular order of sushi! Total Mockery! Not Cool. So to all the friends and acquaintances that We Recomended this place to, Think twice before going back here! I won't be!  The New Chef needs to learn how to serve quality products and the most important of all giving Good Customer Service!  Sayonara Krazy Sushi!",

They're not very prompt & they forget orders, so you have to remind them. Last time I went after I already paid, we asked for mochi & it never came at all. They were about 15 minutes from closing & I knew they wanted to close up but we should have gotten the dessert we asked for when paying the AYCE sushi price. We couldn't find the waiter to remind him a 2nd time, so we ended up just leaving. We'll be back because we love the food & they do have a stamp card but I do hope the service from the staff improves.",

    "text": "Sorry Krazy, the love has gone. I'm so disappointed with the nigiri. First let me explain something: Nigiri (raw fish on top of rice) should not be doused in ponzu soy sauce, but left plain so that the diner can experience the different flavors of each fish and dip in soy sauce to their liking. Sauce the sushi maybe if it were a special or specific sauce for that fish i.e., Unagi nigiri (cooked eel on rice with a sweet teriyaki like glaze), but don't sauce everything!  The last few visits we've noticed an increase in nigiri doused with a very tart and salty ponzu soy sauce that makes the fish taste all the same and depending on the day makes the fish inedible.  On one visit they had a Kobe beef nigiri special, and at $10 for three tiny slivers we were shocked that this was also drenched in the same ponzu soy sauce!!! Totally ruined our Kobe beef, could have been chuck steak for all we knew. At one point I even had to start asking the waiters for 'No Sauce' on any of my AYCE nigiri! Even then, it still came out soaked, rice falling apart and us eating salmon, squid and tuna tasting like nothing but f#@$ing PONZU SOY SAUCE! By the end of the meal, the inside of my mouth felt like I'd been eating pure citric acid. Big sour eww, double, triple sour eww with a side of ponzu soy sauce...ewwww  *I just noticed the picture of Amaebi shrimp in my original review, ironic- it's swimming in PSS. Lol...funny",

If we didn't answer fast enough the server would just walk away. Plus it takes FOREVER to get anything. So if you are on any kind of timeline even if you have three hours, don't go here. You might be late. I was overall just disappointed in the lack of customer service or pursuit to even want to serve good food. I even tried to give it a second chance, will not be giving it a third.

After some searching and looking at reviews from my fellow Yelpers, we decided to go to this one. We first went in July 20th, 2016 and then again tonight. The first time was great so we decided to go again.   Our experience this time was ok. We had a few rolls, some that were good and others that I wasn't too thrilled about.   All this being said, it really is worth it. The service is great, and overall the sushi is good. The best part for me is that they have oysters on the half shell. Only disappointment to this is there is a limit of 2 person however, unlike the screaming orgasm and some other items, it does not say this on the menu but the sushi chef told me this.  I wouldn't drive all the way out here from Henderson but this is the best sushi restaurant on the west side of town!",

Second visit, ordered rolls and nigiris. The food comes fresh as raindrops on eucalyptus leaves in the Rocky Mountains (I don't know if that's a real thing). But yes, fish is fresh and it doesn't taste fishy nor like a dead fish. The service is pretty good and the food came out fast.  I would recommend ordering the following: Screaming Orgasm - salmon with radish and house made sauce Tuna peppered nigiri - seared tuna in pepper Hamachi kama - yellowtail collarbone.  Sake kama - salmon collarbone Pink lady - spicy tuna inside, with tuna sashimi on top Rabbit Pearl - garlic white fish on top with avocado and shrimp tempura Dragon Roll - California roll with eel on top.  That's all you need for your AYCE dinner.  I would've given this place 5 star but the down side is the lack of variety of the appetizers and the shrimp tempura made with panko crumbs (it's usually just batter).   Again, to all you crying about the bathroom, there's a Starbucks next door. Go poop there. I recommend this joint if you're ever in the NW hood craving for susshaaayyyy.",

They're super polite and always seem to be in a good mood. The location is nice as well - spacious, clean and nicely decorated.   I went in maybe an hour and a half before closing. They also are open until 2 am so that's awesome to have some good food open late in a pretty residential area when you're not close to the strip or China town. I am used to staff being rude when you come in that late and feeling uninvited. They were the opposite! So welcoming and inviting despite coming in so late. It's nice to made feel like you aren't a burden like other places do.   The all you can eat is about $27 and the rolls are very creative. I haven't ordered anything that I did NOT like. I recommend the Krazy Burrito and the I Love Starbucks roll. It's a bit pricier than the AYCE places I go to but it's worth it.  I love having these guys so close to my home.

My husband always gets all you can eat dinner for $26 (I don't eat enough so I go a la carte) and let me tell you the waitresses' (there's oddly a lot on staff at once for the size of the restaurant) watch you like a hawk to make sure the all you can eat patrons don't share. I'm pregnant at the moment so I can't eat what he is eating anyway but that doesn't matter to them. I get they probably get cheated out of some food because people do share but it would be nice to eat in peace for a minute. Great sushi and great prices.",

The all you can eat menu is huge and only a few items are one per person. My husband wont stop talking about the oysters. Tara is our favorite waitress and the manager Judy is a huge sweetheart.

I went with a group of 4 and was the only person to order a main menu dish because I have a small appetite and all you can eat is never worth it. The waitress then tried to get me to change my order and customized a bento box for me. I agreed however when my box arrived about 30 minutes after the rest of the table had started eating it was all wrong. I never even got he soup that comes with the box the waitress continued to say she was going to get it but never did. It became a complete joke. There was only one waitress for the entire place and she was the receptionist answering the phones and the only server. Needless to say we spent hours there and I never got what I originally wanted or ordered. I won't be going back to attempt again.",

    "text": "So one of my friends likes sushi like me but because we live in different areas we have our go to spots. Right now his is Krazy Sushi so he took me here finally. Since I have been here a couple times I finally decided to do a review.  The decor is of course modern Asian. It doesn't seem super big but it's never an issue when we go. There's a la carte, and all you can eat. I hardly ever go to places for a la carte since I found out how I love sushi. I usually go all you can eat. Prices for a la carte are of course higher then all you can eat. So if you're hungry do all you can eat and save yourself a high bill.   The quality of the sushi is decent. The rolls are made good. The only time you will have breakage is on some special rolls and it's because of the delicious sauces they put on them. I am a sucker for cajun albacore. Really cajun anything I usually like haha. Their unique roll that has me captured is Snow White Roll. It's on their new items menu and I would at least try it if you go.  Service was good. We sat at the bar and the guys doing the sushi were friendly.  I give Krazy Sushi 3 stars for good food and good service.",

After the third role like this I tried ones with no to zero sauce. Do you ask the sushi chef go easy on the sauce?? Not worth it. I might go back for non sushi food but not worth $27 for over sauced sushi. I like Umami better.",

It's a fantastic little sushi place with upbeat music and a great staff. I definitely recommend it.",

It's been almost a week since going in and it is still irking me so I felt I had to share my experience. Me and my husband went in around 6 on a Saturday and we were greeting and seated quickly. Fast and friendly service, so far so good.  Looked over the menus, I did AYCE he did the chicken teriyaki. My food came out in a weird order two rolls then the Screaming Orgasm which I love. (One of my appetizers was completely forgotten and never arrived). When the waitress set down the SO I was shocked, the tuna was grey. Seriously dark grey with a white-ish rim from being seared. I am not usually one to return food but having gotten sick from bad tuna elsewhere, I had to.  They were polite and returned another much better looking version. Which was okay in taste, way too much mayo for me.  My other rolls were good but nothing stood out. Per the husband chicken teriyaki was on par. After the tuna incident though I will have to take my business up centennial center...",

Three sushi chefs behind the counter but only one seemed to be working on the orders coming back. The sushi chef was not particularly friendly only spoke to ask what we wanted or if we were done. I have found other AYCE sushi in Vegas for less and much better quality.   Will not eat here again.",

After 20 minutes of waiting, I finally got ONE of my orders. 30 minutes went by and my 1 year old son still did not have his food which he was starting to cry for because he is a baby. The gentleman taking care of us seemed to be more interested in EVERY OTHER TABLE but mine. I was nothing but kind to him and I am sure he was busy but the way things happened was simply UNACCEPTABLE. He sat me and my son in the back of the restaurant and just completely forgot about us. I'm not needy or think I'm special but I do expect good service, specially when I spend over $200 a month here. I was a regular here and I must say I will NEVER come back here or recommend this place to anyone after this past experience. It was so unpleasant. The guys at the sushi bar (sushi chefs) are great and are always a pleasure to deal with but the way this server treated me and my son was just DISRESPECTFUL and honestly SO RUDE. I don't want him to get fired but he DEFINITELY needs better training. No one should ever be waiting for their SEAWEED for 30 minutes. Especially when it's just SEAWEED and when it's for a crying 1 year old who just wants his food. I am just SO DISAPPOINTED in the way things went my last visit here. If our waiter was too busy to take care of us, he should have just said so...I would have respected that more than simply being ignored. NOT COOL.",

The selection they offer is very large and I must say the freshness of the fish is amazing. The fish is super bright in color due to the freshness.  I have tried dinning in both the bar top and the tables and were satisfied with both. I like that any server in the restaurant can assist you and you don't have to wait for 1 specific server to come back. I enjoy the promptness in removing my empty plates to make room for more food. Even at the bar the same type of service is provided. I liked watching the sushi chef make the sushi creations. And even though they were busy slammed at times, they were very efficient in making sure your order was still taking care of.  I recommend for you to try it for yourself and save yourself a trip to spring mountain for sure!",

I'm not sure what I was more upset about - the bug on the wall next to me, the terrible food experience or the bad service.   The waitress who greeted us and then took our check was not the same woman taking our orders and bringing food. The latter forgot most of what we ordered, including 2 rolls, 3 orders of nigiri and a bottle of sake. It felt like she was wanting us to leave, so we did.   The bug on the wall - I understand, it happens - but nobody seemed to care, which was sad and disturbing. He just crawled right up there, and watched us eat or disappointing meal. Clearly I afraid of humans or interaction - which tells me they've been around for a while. Gross.   The meal (after all, that's what brought us here.) The nigiri was sad, there texture wasn't that of freshness, and while some of the rice was a solid brick in your mouth, others fell apart when you selected your nigiri. The fish felt dry - like it had been left out and refrigerated. The shrimp lover roll is when I realized that this wasn't good. The shrimp tempura was like a squishy garden hose. Clearly not freshly fried, but done so either earlier that day or the day before. Guitar was hot and cold at the same time - which takes talent!...but not the good kind. We tried the shrimp shumai and immediately regretted it, as the lard-like texture flopped around in our mouths. Most scary of all was the chicken teriyaki - it was a solid chunk of ligament cartilaged and holding strong. Gross.   The tea was good, and plentiful. The coconut Michu delightful as usual. One star for those two items.   Unfortunately we will not be back. Quite sad.",

Last time I went, I came with some friends from out of town (who also have been here before and were excited to return). We came just after the dinner rush so the place was pretty dead, but the service was incredibly disappointing for how not busy it was. The four of us ordered about three rolls each when our waitress first came by, about five minutes later we get our first rolls, but then another 15 minutes goes by and we hadn't received our other orders. We asked our new waitress (I think the first went on break) about the hold up and she said that we hadn't ordered other rolls, which we insisted that we indeed had. She got into a fight with our original waitress in front of us over the confusion, which was uncomfortable. Later, one friend tried asking for a soda instead of a refill on his iced tea and our new waitress said they couldn't do that. That was bizarre. Like, sure you're not going to get a free refill on a new drink, but that's fine. Just charge him for his new drink! That was so strange that our waitress refused to give him a soda.   The food is always great. Props to the sushi chefs there! The staff, though, needs quite a bit of work!",

I always take 3 to 5 other people and do all you can eat (AYCE) for every one, sometimes lunch and other times dinner.  This evening I took my two children for dinner AYCE.   There was no wait to sit down which was nice. Also not a long wait to place our initial order. The server stopped me halfway and said I did not need to order everything all at once, even though I had not ordered an unreasonable amount of items. Out of seven simple items two of them did not show up, one of which was my daughter's California roll. The other item was a small order of garlic tuna. I asked about the garlic tuna and the server got defensive. She went and asked the chef who told her it was already sent out. She returned to the table with my hungry children and said it already came out again. I really wanted to tell them to check the video cameras they have inside of the restaurant but I nicely said I would take another order if she thinks they came out. I said we still did not get the California roll either.  For some reason this seemed like an issue to her even though all three customers had AYCE. Later the tuna came out but we never saw the California roll even after a few other small orders.   As with all AYCE I know eating all of the rice is part of the gig. My son had a piece of rice fall onto the table from his roll between the size of a penny and a quarter ball. This was the only rice not eaten however the server scorned him saying we have to eat all the rice.  To avoid another issue we said to leave the rice and the busser came by and cleared the plate with the small piece of rice.  We then waited at least 20 minutes to see the server again... apparently we had had enough food in her mind. My kids wanted mochi ice cream so we ordered that. Shortly after the mochi came with the check. The check had the kids two drinks and three adult AYCE. I asked what the deal was since adult is 26.95 and children 4-10 are 20.95 for dinner. The server again gets defensive and asks how old are they. To avoid her claiming any issues about making up ages, I had my kids answer her. Neither of them are over 10 or look over 10 either. The server again gets bitchy and says well ok then.... but they ordered something that is adult only price. Having kept very polite the whole time I finally let her know I was pissed off at this point. I explained the missed food, the attitude issue, waiting to order dessert for 20 minutes, and so on. She says sarcastically...... ohhhh really???????  They ended up giving the kids prices but of course they don't bring back a proper receipt, just the debit card receipt. I think it was still off around $1 but I was done there. I went ahead and tore up my Krazy stamp card and left it on the table. I told her I would not be back.  I eat out almost every day for lunch and several times a week for dinner.  From cheap fast food to high dollar steak houses. I am far from a regular here but I go to this place about once a month.   The food quality was not bad but the experience made it suck.  Two things: I have never left a bad review for any place on any review site. I have never, ever, left a restaurant without leaving a tip.  Both of these changed today.",

    "text": "This is my favorite spot for sushi date night! Service is fast and the staff are extremely friendly. The sushi is also excellent. I'm so happy I am able to order my favorite sushi, seared salmon here. I found that many places in Vegas don't have it on the menu, but they were happy to make it for me.   My hubby and I have been here for AYCE dinner twice. It's $26.95 which I feel is pretty comparable to other sushi restaurants around town. We ordered baked mussels, volcano roll, lasagna roll, a variety of nigiris, salmon skin handroll, chicken skewers and topped it with honey toast.   The baked mussels had just the perfect amount of cream cheese, and a delicious sauce that almost tasted like a soy sauce vinegar. Cooked to perfection.   I also highly recommend the honey toast. It is normally a la carte, but is free with AYCE dinner. It's a toasted Hawaiian sweet roll, drizzled with honey, and topped with a small scoop of ice cream. Perfect.   The sushi is pretty standard, but the service and atmosphere is what makes it 5 stars. Can't wait to go back again!",

I was with my mom & 10 month old daughter & my aunt & my cousin with her parents as a party of 6 & a half . The servers were very nice a patient & the food was very tasteful but the amount of time we waited to get our next dishes took longer than expected . It wasn't very busy in there & noticed other customers were being served before us although we were there/ordered ahead of them but I guess they only had one chef for the whole restaurant so it was kinda understandable. Despite that I'll still come back for another experience cause it's close to the house & my cousin & I got a free tempura green tea ice cream for writing a review . Nice staff & good ambiance.",

It's mostly the same and the biggest knocks are that the tempura shrimp sit under heat for hours and the rolls and super small and drenched in sauce.   None of it really tastes that bad and the crew was nice enough and got my food out quick. It was a busy lunch rush on a Saturday and they seemed adequately staffed and orders came out super fast. I would just recommend a slightly different approach to the tempura shrimp, increase the rolls size (the prices here justify the increase in size as they aren't cheap) and scale back on the sauce a bit.",

It wasn't often, but often enough to have seen the downhill slope.   It was good rice ratio the first time I went years ago, then a bit more rice but still acceptable level and it stayed at that for a long while.   Now the corners are just cutting it too much. It was ridiculous that we only ordered one round of nigiri. Thin fish slices and way krazy rice - look at the photo. It was a 20/80 ratio, when it used to be fair. We ended up eating rolls and appetizers instead since those were a bit more fair.   Also everytime the lady came to check on us and we had nothing in front of us, she asks if we're done or if we want dessert. It made me feel like we were trying to be rushed off being asked \"are you done?\" frequently. We had a few pockets of long wait since one of the times our order fell and then he did everyone elses order and then forgot about redoing ours.   Sometimes reviews don't need to be lengthy. The long drive to our fair sushi spot will be worth it. This was just bad.",

PS please upload your menu KRAZY SUSHI I KNOW YOU ARE WATCHING I KNOW YOU CAN SEE THIS I\"M COMING RIGHT NOW FOR YOUR DEEP FRIED SUSHI DONT THINK I WONT SAY SOMETHIGN ABOUT NO MENU ONLINE ALWJRLKJLK@J#$OLKIJRLKJ@#LK$LK",

He keeps asking anything else we wanna eat. We r not really sure what to order so we just picked randomly and the food i can give a THUMBS UP IS \"CHARLIES SPECIAL\". If u are ordering BURNING YOUR BOOM HOLE make sure to order the sauce on the side because it issssssss spicy... U don't really need the sauce, by itself is really good already. If u guys like sushi this place is good u wont feel shy ordering so much food because they won't make u feel uncomfortable...",

About the same as other places but now near my house. A guest ordered one sitting next to me and it looked good. I'm glad this place is doing better. Good portions on the nigiri too.",

The servers were pretty nice overall but gave me a bit of guff because I had left over food with the AYCE. The reason I had left overs was because the rolls I got (Rehab and TNT) were very close to inedible. The sauce that they are trying to pass off as eel is some sort of sour teriyaki sauce and it completely covered the rolls. The cucumber salad was closer to a pickle salad. The popcorn calamari was 100% tasteless. Also, when I requested a different drink, raspberry iced tea to diet coke, the server used the same glass and my drink tasted awful.  That being said, the sushi items I had were up to par. I would not recommend even giving this place a shot because there are plenty more options just a few miles away.",

I did however find out that they are open til 2 a.m. (I didn't realize they were open that late though)  When I stopped in at approx 12:45 a.m. on Tuesday night to place a to go order, there wasn't a single person in there.  I was surprised because my other 4 sushi places I visit late at night always have a crowd in there late night.   So PLEASE people don't underestimate this place.  It's a good place, great variety and the quality of the sushi is good.  It's not great or better then any place else but it's good and I've been to far far far worse places.",

    "text": "I still love the food here, but our most recent experience put a damper on my opinion of the place. Vegas is the Mecca for all you can eat sushi places. This place offers that too. However, it seems they have added so many rules and restrictions to this option that it is detracting from the concept. My favorite is the green mussels. Now you can only have one order. There are now multiple items that are flagged similarly. Sorta defeats the point! I think it is time to find a new sushi joint.",

Food is delicious. They make me love sushi more.   Place is so sweet and taste so good that I had to pause me eating and write a post on Yelp!   A++",
