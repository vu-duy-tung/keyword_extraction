Only knocked off a star because they charge $6 for Thai Iced Tea, which costs almost nothing to make, and then would not offer refills, which is standard in most Thai places. For that price, I expect a refill. Overall though, no complaints about anything else, and I would visit again. The pot stickers were amazing.",

However, I do not recommend their \"chicken\" dishes.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken (a.k.a. chicken with peanut).   (1) Sauce far too sweet (2) Too much sauce.  Chicken and peanuts floating in sauce (3) The most important is that the chicken was not real.  This is the so-called \"rubberized\" chicken, which is a highly processed product and not actual white or dark meat chicken.  Stay away!  Horrible.",

They r so full of shit!  The beef look and taste like its been there for weeks.... Their broth taste like its loaded with msg which is bad for the heart. I never had a bowl of Pho as bad as this... If u claim u can cook Pho then get the right chef that knows how to cook it right; if not,  then take it off the menu... Venetian casino doesn't deserve this kind of bad review. In addition,  the basil that was suppose to come with my Pho is completely rotten to the core... I was wondering how could u serve this trash to the customer knowingly that it was uneditable... I would never come back to this dump they call a restaurant and I would never recommend anybody to this place. It is absolutely an embarrassment to visit this establishment!!",

My bf and I shared the red wontons and the szechwan beef noodle soup. I'm usually not a fan of wontons or sour-ish soups but both were pretty dang delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness to really hit the spot! I'm sure it tastes even better after a long night of clubbing. I also tried some of my cousin's sausage fried rice and it was really good too! It's a little overpriced for Chinese food but hey, what isn't overpriced in a hotel in Vegas, right?  Another plus about this restaurant is that the service is quick! Our food came out really fast. So if you're in a hurry, this is an ideal place to go!",

It can be pretty pricey, esp for noodles, because you can typically get Pho for less than $10 at any normal restaurant...whether or not it is \"Prime\" pho.  The pho here is $16.95, but just remember, you're eating at the Venetian, so you can't expect dirt-cheap prices for anything...this is how they roll, so you can either roll with it, or roll yourself out to another eating establishment =p  The pho was very good tho, bigger than I expected, and the broth was pretty good.    The wonton soup and fried rice were pretty good also, and so was this spicy noodle dish, which I forget at the moment exactly what it was called.    Lines can be long, even late at night, but because you're in Vegas, you just gotta gamble and go when you're stomach wants you to go and see what happens.  Would definitely eat here again, esp if I'm staying in the hotel, just because it's so convenient.  I DID, however, have one encounter with beverage;  how do you run out of drinks? Granted, we got here after 10, but goodness, no Thai iced tea, chrysanthemum tea, OR Pepsi?! Come on!  Gotta stay stocked...people.  That's the only reason for the 3 star rating...if I come 3 more times and they have the drink I want, then I'll bump them back up.",

The first thing was it was hard to find because they are doing construction inside the casino. The restaurant is located in the back behind the construction--they needed better signage. Secondly, the place was packed so we had higher hopes for the place. I honestly thought the food was ok and did pacify our craving, but I was really turned off by the plastic utensils and paper plates...it almost felt like I was eating take-out in the restaurant. The service was also not that great. I know my friend wanted Asian food, but this is not the place I envisioned for us inside a casino. Almost felt like it should be part of a food court. The decor does make it feel like an asian diner.",

Even though we were four hungry slightly drunk Asian girls, we managed to finish almost all of it but we could have done one dish less.  Overall, nice people, expensive price tag for mediocre Chinese food but redeemed by the fact that they're open late and have the right amount of grease in the food :)",

We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 5. No biggie, but the number of tables limits the customers from doing what they do best in Vegas...eating.  Unlike some of the other restaurants in a casino area, this one has some great views of the casino floor and the sports book tv's. So you get some entertainment as well.  I got the roast pork and roast duck with rice combination. For a Chinese owned, Chinese cooked, Chinese restaurant, I was a bit disappointed at the roast duck. Not one of the best ones I've had. The roast pork was decent and the white rice...well it's hard to mess up white rice (unless you give me the crusty, burnt up ones that stick to side of the rice cooker) But no...I didn't get the crusty version. It was nice and flaky. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA?select=bX7Hbk4GbIEsYuQGoh4TRw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_j2E...</a>  I'd probably get the fried rice next time.

At least, that's what my fiance and I did when we were looking for a place to eat. We were bleeding money in Vegas (like everyone else) and wanted to find a place that had decent prices for decent food on the Strip. So we ended up at Noodle Asia.  The prices are slightly higher than what we would pay in Chinatown Houston, at least for what we ordered. We got flat rice noodles with beef and Chinese sausage fried rice. Both pretty tasty in their own right. However, some of the other things on the menu were priced ridiculously.   I would come back again if I felt like I spent too much money the day before, especially if I just wanted to stay on the Strip.

My wife is much more traditional Chinese food type so she went with the  safe shrimp fried rice. It was good.  I ordered the Shiu Mai with Pai Goo Noodle soup. It's all about the noodles  here.  They were just wonderful.   Service. just OK. They are busy and seem always busy but if real Asian noodles is what your after. ( and most of the other patrons were Asian.  Really a good sign ) This fits the bill. Reasonable price point especially in the heart of the Venetian resort.  Well worth your time",

    "text": "I stopped by here during some night of the most recent Vegas trip, why can't I remember which night?! We probably got tired of Jet and decided to leave early. Our plan was to meet a couple friends at Venetian but Jon K and I were hungry so we decided to grab some noodles for a late night snack!   It took a few moments before anyone could help us or point us to a table, but it was pretty late so it's understandable. Our waiter came by with our menus immediately, he was also immediately ready to take our order! Way too fast, dude! Boyfriend & I shared the Szechuan Beef noodle soup, and our friend ordered the wonton noodle soup I think. He really liked his soup, and ours was delicious!! I was kinda worried bc it was supposed to be spicy, but it was just right! It warmed me up without making me reach for everyone's ice water! The beef was also super tender, yummy!   Price was a lil high, but hey, it's in the Venetian! And it wasn't anything more than you'd find at a pricey Asian place in any other city, so overall not too shabby! Definitely great for late night snack, it isn't too crowded and your food comes out pretty quick!",

But the best part of the whole experience was that the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and knew what to suggest. He helped my friends choose vegetarian dishes and they loved the food too.  Given that its inside Venetian, the food was very reasonably priced. The final check came down to 75 bucks including tip for 3 people. Loved every part of it.",

However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else.   I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me \"no\", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)  I guess what they lack in service they make up for in the food.",

There's a reason you see tons of Asians eating at a Chinese restaurant in a casino and that would include me. The place makes authentic Chinese food for higher than authentic prices. The service is also authentically curt but prompt, heh.  Even though the prices are sometimes more than double than what you would get in a cheap chinese restaurant, it is relatively inexpensive compared to other restaurants in the Venetian. The food also taste much better than the typical take-out.  I've had multiple noodle dishes from soups to stir-fry and have been impressed with the flavours of each. Standouts include the Szechuan beef stew and the duck soup. The appetizers are where the authenticity of the dishes is apparent as there are offerings unfamiliar to people who frequent the usual Chinese-American places.  My friend ordered a vegetarian rice dish which he enjoyed even though I made fun of his ordering a non-noodle dish at a noodle place.",

I've ordered the Work Won Ton Soup, and I was expecting something fancy. It's just regular Won Ton Soup with some Char Siu, Chicken, and Shrimp thrown into the soup. Nothing special for a $20 bowl of dumplings! Where I'm from, a bowl like that would cost $5.   I would still come back to this restaurant even though the food isn't the best. I like the view of all the sports channels and I usually stay at the Venetian during my stays.   Don't come here expecting anything particular, and enjoy the hot food with a stunning view.",

The main problem we had with the restaurant was how we were charged extra for a side order. To explain, my dad ordered a beef stew noodle ($14) that was a reasonable portion, but the noodle-to-beef ratio was off so we ordered a side of beef.   I was shocked when the bill came and the small side of beef stew was $20. Whoa mama wtf is disssss!! We even tried to look on the menu but nowhere did it say beef stew by itself was $20, it seem like we were paying for a'la carte. The side was absolutely not $20 (perhaps $10 for a small dish).  Despite the food being decent, I'm doubtful about coming in again if I'm charged an unreasonable price for something that's not an entree.  TL;DR, good food and opened long but BEWARE of prices for sides or additional add-ons.",

Also, this place is very reasonably priced for Vegas and the dishes are big enough to share.  I highly recommend it!  Someone else said they ate there at 3AM.  I definitely walked by at 1AM and they were closed...otherwise I might have eaten there 3 times.  :)  So yeah, if you're staying at the Venetian, this place is worth a taste.",

But not at the best location. Right next to the Race and Sports book, they got one of them there Chinese places. Actually this restaurant houses some of the best fresh noodle makers here. So I'm here enough times when my family comes into town. Won Ton soup. Large steaming bowl of freshly made won tons. And they're BIG! Red Won Tons.... Spicy...Not for white people Large cantonese BBQ plate Yea I LOVE DUCK --- bbq pork is fresh and doesn't look like it's been sitting. Soy sauce chicken...well it's hard to really f*ck up soy sauce chicken. Pot stickers are fresh! The Sui Mai and Har Gow are fresh.....popping flavors. Night Market Fried Rice --- YUMMY! XO Shrimp Lai Fen --- SPICY and Yummy!  Well watch out --- if you don't like thick noodles --- make sure you watch what you get. Ask the server.  But overall --- service is efficient and there are actually asian people working and not mexican in the kitchen....",

My only gripe this time was they put a crap load of MSG in the noodles. 30 minutes after I had my meal, my stomach was acting up the rest of the night.  It was ok. I won't even complain about the price because you're in the Venetian afterall but the service was slow and the waitstaff was rude unfortunately.",

It had marinated beef, pan fried noodles, and veggies. The waiter said it was normally very spicy so I decided to order it mild since I sweat like crazy with spicy food. Unfortunately it was so mild that I didn't taste any of the spiciness at all. What I did taste was pain from the fresh pan fried noodle center. This was a dish to be eaten slowly! I ended up burning my mouth a little but I needed to get back in to the action.  Pro-tip: If you play poker, talk to the poker room boss for a food voucher.",

I had Szechuan-style Beef noodle soup, which can be had for around seven dollars in California, but was around 13 dollars here. The noodles were a little weird, but the beef and soup were so delicious. The beef was actually very good quality with quite a bit of fat (which is apparently the correct style for this noodle soup). I gobbled it up. My dining mate had BBQ pork and duck noodle soup, which I wasn't particularly a fan of, but she said it was good (particularly the quality of the meats).  The food itself was potentially of five-star quality for one of those quick sit and go restaurants in Vegas, but considering that it's about double the price and not THAT higher quality, I can only give it four stars.",

The broth was a little on the bland side, but there was a generous amount of both noodles and pork. The lamb chops were super disappointing. It had been fried, which was not in the description at all, and I could barely taste the lamb. And it was like $10! So not worth it.  My coworker ordered some spicy noodle soup dish, which she mostly finished. But it seemed that it wasn't very spicy because she piled so much extra chili sauce into it.

($13 + $3 for extra noodles) - Beef Noodle Soup:  Very good!  Definitely the best part of the meal was eating a hot bowl of beef noodle soup filled with steamy broth, niu rou and the tendon.  It was cooked very well and the noodles were cooked al dente. I think they gave some of the sour veggies on top, which was yummy as well.  ($13) - Pho:  I didn't try it, but the price was a whopping $15-17! (I forget the exact price.)  SERVICE (3/5):  I'm a little surprised that Noodle Asia had a hostess who didn't know a lick of English. She had asked us to clear some space in the front and she said, \"Back to go.\"  We didn't understand what she wanted and she seemed very flustered and angry (at herself?).  When a few people came to the front to ask how long the wait was, she didn't seem like she wanted to answer because they had asked in English.  The service in the restaurant wasn't too great either-- it was exactly what I had expected from a Chinese restaurant. However, since we were paying an arm and a leg for something that typically costs $6-8 in California, and since we were in Las Vegas, I was expecting better service.  At least some refill on tea and water... but we didn't get any of that type of service, and we got the same \"rushed, stony-faced, no 'thank you'\" service that we got at Sam Woo (in Chinatown). Haha.  I would still come back though. The venue and service are nothing to write home about, but the beef noodle soup definitely hit the spot for me.  WAIT:  We wanted for about 20 minutes and there were about 7 parties ahead of us. The good thing is that the line moved decently fast-- people get their noodles and dishes quickly, chomp it down, and then leave for more Vegas fun.  When I called at 12 pm, the person who picked up the phone said the wait was 1 hour.  O_O    VENUE:  Venetian / First Floor (in Casino).",

I arrived at about 6:30 pm and surprisingly they were not very busy when I was seated but were about 75% to capacity by the time I left. Noodle Asia is located on the casino floor of the Venetian Hotel and there is usually a line to get in. I think I might have been a little early for any crowds.  I ordered the shrimp shu mai which were now and always have been as good as they can get. Just enough filling to wrapper ration and incredible seasoning.   Then for me the piece de resistance. The dish that I always crave when I am away from Las Vegas and that I crave again the next day after I have it. The Szechuan Beef and Noodle Soup. The broth can be customized to your taste. Anywhere from mild to very spicy. I chose medium. The broth is incredible. So very tasty that I have trouble not finishing it before I eat anything else in the bowl. Then there are the noodles. Fresh, medium thickness. Cooked to the perfect doneness. But the crown jewel of the dish is the beef. Six or seven huge pieces of beef that literally melt in your mouth. The soup is a combination of flavors that is perfect and hard to find so perfectly blended together.  I have been a regular here for many years and my love affair with Noodle Asia continues.",

She then, looking annoyed, basically scolded me and said that I should have told her about my allergy before ordering.  Forgive me, but why in the Sam Hill would I mention an allergy when I'm ordering something I'm not allergic to? Are you kidding me?  And is it ever really a good idea to scold a paying customer?

They explained because they get a lot of international people and they do this all the time to avoid confusion. And that we obviously looked like it was our first time in American? To them?  That is somewhat understandable, because yes we look Asian, but it was extremely annoying. Very bad customer experience.   It's almost like those waitress girls were jealous me/us.

    "text": "I will start with.. my older sister has been going here for many years now and always recommended it to me and others.  So since we were celebrating my daughters 21st Birthday this weekend at The Venetian, I knew we had to try it during our 3 day stay.  When we arrived we were rushed to a corner table, given our menus and made to wait for some time.  When ordering, we ordered drinks, appetizers and noodle soup style dishes.  To start we never received both appetizers to begin with.  My daughters appetizer was given to a table right next to our table that sat down at least 15 minutes after us!  So that was our 1st problem.  Our entrees were served and we still didn't receive our appetizers after asking twice about them.  Finally the manager came and apologized and said they will be on the house.  She then walked away and yelled really bad at the staff where we could hear just as many others could.  Which now made us feel awful.  Now on to the worst part of our wonderful experience...  Me and my daughter ordered the same seafood noodle soup.  We ate about 1/3 - 1/2 of our dishes when my daughter noticed something big float up that didn't seem to look like anything that should be there.  Her friend said.. \"oh my god!  That's a big worm!\"  My daughter didn't want to jump to conclusions since the soup did have calamari and other seafood in it.  Well they took it out with the spoon and put it on the napkin.. and she was sadly right.. it was a worm!  Now we all felt sick!  We called for the manager right away at this point!  She came over and said.. \"no worries, your appetizers are on the way, no charge\".  Then we told her and showed her what was in the soup!  At this point my daughter had tears in her eyes and just wanted to go!  The manager had the nerve to inspect it at the table and finally said. \"Oh, you're right, I'm so very sorry\".  And walked fast away with it in a napkin! Wish we would have gotten a picture... but she knew to take it with her, but of course didn't take the bowl it came in!  We had to keep looking at it!  Then a server came and said \"no charge for the one soup and appetizers\".  Like are you serious!  Of course no charge for that and NO, we don't want a new soup!  We had to tell them we just wanted to leave at this point!    The manager never came back and we just got up and walked out at this point!  The table next to us stopped eating as well when they overheard what happened.  And this restaurant was lucky!  Because we weren't extra loud and didn't make a big show like many others would have done!    I've NEVER had such a bad experience!  And I was a food server for 15+ years!  I've also NEVER seen such poor customer service!  This place should be ashamed on how they treated us!  They had the nerve to even think I was paying for my soup that was the exact same order as my daughters!  Probably made in the same pot in the same dirty kitchen!  The staff needs to get retrained and the prep kitchen needs to be the start of it!    What a nightmare of an experience!!  We ended up not eating even after leaving because just seeing the worm made us all lose our appetites!  Thanks a lot Noodle Asian for a VERY AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!",

Wasn't the biggest fan of the pork, but it was very crunchy. The noodles were on the gummy side, but it definitely satisfied my craving for noodles.",

The har gow dim sum appetizer is also a classic and must try as well.   It is Vegas but price wise it's going to cost you $30 per person for an app + main.",

When trying to order, was informed that they were out of dumplings. (??) So just ordered the Dan Dan noodles (listed under the wok fried noodle section of the menu) and got a bowl of noodles in water with some sauce and meat. If there had been no water, it might have been good, but instead was bland and almost flavorless. The waitress was nice enough to replace with another dish, the Shanghai rice cakes. They were passable, but loaded with mushrooms (not on the description). My wife ordered the seafood congee and enjoyed it   All in all a slightly disappointing experience.",

Of course you would expect it that way since it is located inside a casino in Las Vegas. So its not a surprise. The food was good, nothing mind blowing or special.  Just average chinese food without a twist. LOL.  I mean that in a very sarcastic way.  I still give this place a 4 star only because their food wasn't bad, but the service could be a tad bit better. The servers don't smile, it takes forever to get my water filled and I'm not sure they are that happy. Who knows. Expect to pay around $8-10 USD for a 4pc dimsum item.  I feel like you can probably get something better off the strip and a whole lot cheaper that are normal dimsum pricing.  Again, just note, don't expect much ... this is inside a casino therefore the prices are sort of expected.",

In between all the fine dining, it's nice being able to escape from the Vegas bustle by not having to leave the Strip and cozy up to simple nostalgic home dishes.  Szechwan beef soup is a traditional favorite of mine with the broth having the right amount of spice flavor and heat. The beef is tender and the noodles are on point being chewy and soft.   The fish filet congee is another comfort food. The fish is delicate and congee is cooked well. Personally, I wish there was more fish and this requires a couple dashes of salt, but after doing so at the table, it is perfect.  Unlike typical Chinese restaurants, traditional Chinese cooking at home doesn't drown the dish with oils, sauce, and salt which is why Noodle Asia brings such comfort to me.",

We also ordered orange chicken. I am not sure how this chicken should taste,  but I didn't like whatever we got: the chicken was dry and heavily breaded, to the point where I thought I was eating deep fried flour and not chicken.   Also,  I understand it is supposed to be a fast food place,  but it was very awkward when we got our soups and had to wait almost 10 minutes for our party member to get his chicken. I don't like eating when somebody at the table still doesn't have their food. Our waiter was polite - the only positive moment...",

Fried Rice w/chinese sausage, pork dumplings in the spicy sauce were also good. Mongolian beef great, but nothing out of this world. Calamari balls were good, but no sauce was a bit confused how what to eat it with. It was convenient, clean and quick however, not sure i'd want to come here if i'm not a guest at the hotel.",

Tired, hungry, slightly hungover, and wanting something to satisfy the need of something homey that American food cannot, Noodle Asia was the most appropriate dining opportunity. Plus it was just downstairs in the lobby at the Venetian.  Shitty service, but it didn't matter when we got our bowls. The waitress took our orders and requests, but that was it .

Seems more like quantity over quality here...but eh does the job.  *Yung chow and seafood/bbq pork fried rices were delicious and came in huge portions.  If I ever ate here again I\"d just order the fried rice.  *The Szechwan Beef noodle soup that everyone raves about was blah.  Where people drunk when they had this?  I was sober and the broth was blah.  Noodles were kinda soggy. At least the beef was good.  *Mixed seafood pan toasted noodles.  So I was envisioning the yummy pan fried cantonese noodles from PF Chang's when I ordered this.   I was disappointed when the noodles were the thin vermicelli ones.  It def. was toasted on the outside which is fine, but the sauce was pretty flavorless.  Booooring....  * Wonton soup was tasty.  * Mike C. had the roast pork and roast duck with rice combination.  He didn't like the roast duck and thought the roast pork was decent.  I thought his rice with the sauce it came with was delicious though.",

But creatures of habit as we are, we always stick to the same dishes... can't miss right.  And they're always excellent.    Spicy Scezchuan beef soup... it's got some serious kick but so flavorful.  Yes spicy, but with the proper ratio of flavors.    Pai Goo noodles, which is basically a pork chop with noodles... Simple, tasty, and very fresh.  Spicy cucumbers... accompaniment of some fresh veggies.  Congee... all very tasty.  Again, comfort food with great flavors.  All the above tend to be on the somewhat lighter, brothy side.  Would love to try some of the other dishes, like any of the fried noodles.  And yes, as the name implies why wouldn't i?  Well, bc it's all pretty damn greasy and as tasty as that may sound, and as much as i like not having to put on any lip gloss, it's just all way too heavy.  And i think that's where some of the negative reviews might come in.  Service was solid, not 5 star Fancy LV restaurant, but yunno, it's a $13/bowl of noodle level of service.    It is however, clean.  And fast.  Fresh.  Tasty.    So, basically, it's what most of us want in a good chinese restaurant that is unbelievably difficult to find.   Very affordable, fresh, tasty, comfort food, in a clean setting.   Trust me, that ain't easy when it comes to Chinese food.",

I've tried several beef noodle soups in the LA area and yeah, a couple are pretty darn good, but they are no NOODLE ASIA GOOD.  The other versions that I've had barely have any heat, Noodle Asia's soup definitely has a spicy kick to it.  Soup isn't too heavy and the beef is very tender.  The noodles are thick, the way I like it.  I like the onions and pickled veggies that comes on top too. I know it's Vegas but too bad it's $13 and the bowl isn't that big.  I want some now!",

We got a bowl of thin egg noodle soup (around $14) with Cantonese dumplings (about 5-6 total) and added crispy roast Duck for another $6.50.  I enjoyed the duck but that made expensive soup way more expensive.  For that price, the duck should've been included.  However it was good and had two thin pieces of Chinese Broccoli.  I ladled it into 3 small bowls so no one was getting full on that.  I also ordered Kim Chee but it was supermarket quality.  Don't bother for nearly $6.  Also got BBQ Pork fried rice.  It was good and the pieces of BBQ pork were nice but I think I would splurge next time and get the 3 meat combo of Roast Duck, BBQ Pork and soya chicken for $23.50.  Many of the tables were ordering the 2-way or 3-way meat combos and they looked delicious.  We ordered a Thai Ice Tea and it was splendid, but for over $40 for just a noodle soup with duck, fried rice, Kim Chee and tea, I would venture off the strip next time and skip this place.",

We came here around dinner time, and the service was pretty fast. Noodle soups came out before the dry noodles. I noticed that the dry noodle had more noddles/veggies/meat than the soup kind.  I think they open late, so it would probably make a good late-night meal. I will come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

And the price is reasonable considering where it is. Everytime I come here( I go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year), I've always had fast service. Of course it won't be as good as the restautants in the SF Bay Area though.  I know they have some other 'non-Chinese' things here like sake but they have mostly Chinese dishes. This is what I ordered the last time I was there:  Hot and Sour Soup(kind of spicy but I like spicy) Red Won Tons(kind of plain but not bad) Spicy Beef Tripe(this was good although I wish it warm, didn't know it was a cold dish) Si Jiu Beef(this was good)",

The service is fast and this restaurant is a little tucked away next to the sports book.  You can also order room service from Noodle Asia but it's not as good.  Or at least the noodle soup isn't.",

    "text": "I arrived into Vegas on a later flight on a FR night so it was like 2:00 AM before I even got to my hotel on the strip.  Of course flying in from the east coast, I was starving as I'm not a fan of most airport food unless I have no alternatives.  I Yelped around for what might be open and I wanted something on the light side as I was exhausted and heading to bed after this.   Hmmm, what's open at 02:00 AM, and servers light food and was close to my location - Noodle Asia fit the bill.   I walked up at 02:00 and was prompted greeted and seated.  I got a good feeling when there were quite a few Asian patrons who seemed like they were having a great meal present.  The place was not full, though not as empty as I expected for 02:00, but hey, this is Vegas.   Given I wanted to eat light, I had a bowl of soup -  Miso with Enoki Mushrooms Soup and a bowl of steamed Edamame.  The Edamame arrived quickly and had a nice scent of 5 spice and was salted perfectly.  they hit the spot while I waited for my soup to arrive!   The Miso was a great blend and adding the Enoki Mushrooms gave it just the right added texture and substance I was hoping for a lighter meal.    They also had quite a few other noodle soups, rice dishes, wok noodles, and appetizers.  I did not see anything on the menu which looked outrageously priced - especially give you are in the Venetian!  In fact, given the quantity of food I received, these prices were in line with what I've had in San Francisco and other larger cities in similar locations.   My meal came to $13.  I was VERY pleased!  I will be trying to go back before I leave but if not, I will return the next time I'm in Vegas!",

The place is small and doesn't have many tables.  We were lucky enough to get in before the lunch rush.  By the time we ordered our food, there was a long line and people were waiting for tables.  The food here is delicious!!!  A bit pricey, but what do you expect from Vegas and the Venetian?  Dishes were in the $10-18 range, when you can get it at home for about half the price.  (Chicken chow mein was about $13-15).  We had lunch for 4 people and ordered Fried Rice, Chow Mein, beef tripe appetizers and spicy garlic chicken wings.  This was the best chow mein I ever had.  The noodles tasted soooo fresh and delicious.  It wasn't salty and the onions were cooked al dente (the way I like it).  The fried rice was also delicious.  It was fresh and wasn't greasy.  The spicy chicken wings were topped with fried jalapenos and garlic.... OMG! Flavor explosion!  This place is pretty authentic.  None of that Panda Express, PF Chang's bullsh*t here.  I love that you can see the Chinese cooks inside the kitchen!  There was lots of steam and yelling back there, but I loved it! Hahaha..    Noodle Asia gets 5 stars because it's right off on the casino floor and a few feet from the penny slots.  While we were waiting for our food, I stepped out of the restaurant to play some penny slots for a bit.  A minute into playing, I won $60 on the penny slots!",

We partied at XS @ Encore and walked back towards the Venetian just to have some chinese grub, instead of taking the taxi to chinatown back/forth for the same amount of dough.  Had the porridge dish as well as the fried chicken wings & also the szechwan beef noodle soup and singapore fried noodle.   Sounds like alot of food for the 3 of us, but it was actually pretty good to cure the buzz and the quality wasn't bad for casino chinese food.  Only gripe was, the porridge was lukewarm and they promptly took it back and heated it up nicely for us.  Worth a shot if you just want some quick chinese food and are near the Venetian.",

Our Chinese Broccoli came out 1st, almost 10 minutes before the rest of our food. Dim sum Shui Mai was was so so, Dan Dan noodles were really disappointing. We paid the bill and still had a half beer to finish, they really wanted to turn our table and rush us out.

They were very accommodating and the food was pretty good. When it came time to pay, my friend and I wanted to pay for the birthday girl's share. I wasn't provided a receipt after paying so I went to ask for one because the birthday girl kept asking (wondering why no one took her credit card). All in all, not bad for my first time here.",

A few minutes later, 2 more Caucasian couples sat at the other end of the bar, they got their orders almost right away. Then the same waitress came over to take my order with an attitude. Got my water and waited. While the 1st couple almost finished their food, My appetizer just arrived. Another Caucasian sat next to me, got his order right away, while I continued to wait for my entree. Almost every one at the bar was done with their meals and left, my entree was still no where to find. I flagged down the manager and started to say \"I was the 1st one to arrive...\" The manager could not wait for me to finish my statement and said she'd check. No apologies, no nothing. She went through a big pile of order tickets to dig out my order. Then I still had to wait for another 5 minutes to get my entree. Guess what, it was burnt. I picked through unburnt pieces, paid with a 20% tip and left.",

I agree with others who enjoyed the spicy Szechwan (sp?) beef noodle soup. I don't usually like star anise flavoring, but they did a great job with the broth, definitely slurp-worthy.  The other dish was pan-fried noodles with seafood, which was generic in a good solid way. Nothing to rave about, but tasty. You might try topping it off with the red vinegar and some chili sauce to give it some kick. We also tried the potstickers and the shu mai. I liked the filling for the potstickers, but the shu mai I thought was just so-so. The service was fine, but I got the sense that the management doesn't necessarily stress the usual tenets of customer service in the \"American\" sense, so I'm not surprised by some of the complaints recorded in other reviews. Overall, definitely worth a try if you are at the Venetian and want to try the beef noodle soup for lunch!",

She needs to gain retraining on customer service.  It was our first time eating at the restaurant and we weren't aware of the portion sizes there so shortly after she took our order she remarks, \"That's it?  It's not enough.\"  That comment make its seem like you guys look like you eat a lot so order more.  Instead, she should have said, \"Our portion sizes here are small and I suggest you make one or two more orders and I recommend....\"  Sure enough when the food came and we ate all of it and it wasn't enough so we had placed two more order but we placed our orders from a different server.  Who knew that team work does not exist with Iris Xu because right before we received our last order she comes at our table asking who took our order and said \"next time order from her.\"  She should have thanked her fellow coworker for helping out during the busy time instead of getting upset.  All I know is that we will NOT be returning back to eat there and I will be spreading the word here in San Diego about my bad experience with them.",

Another thing I love was their kim-chee, sounds weird, but their kim-chee was just perfectly enough sour that all my Korean friends that went with me was extremely ecstatic. One of the times I tried their duck noodle soup and it was flavorful and the egg noddles was cooked just right. I highly recommend!",

Also tried the seafood pan fried noodles which were excellent as well, some of the best I've had in awhile.  We also had the siu mai which were passable.    Overpriced for what it is but if you're gambling at the Venetian and you want some noodles, I would try this over the crap pizza and sandwiches they have at the other end of the casino.",

Also, the beef noodle soup is the highly recommended dish, but it was disappointing, overly spicy, and I know what good beef noodle soup tastes like! One of my friends got the beef chow fun noodles and it took so long for them to make it, by the time we were almost done eating his dish came it. It was piping hot and greasy, but better than the pho or the beef noodle soup.

The service was not very good because the guy kept forgetting us and rushing us to order. However, once we got the order placed--the dishes came by super fast.  We ordered: - Chicken/Mushroom Noodle Soup - Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - Shrimp Dumplings - Hot and Sour Soup - Cold Jelly Fish Side dish  The Chicken/Mushroom soup came in a nice portion sized bowl and it was not cheap. My dad said the flavor was good , but my mom preferred my hot and sour soup better. There were lots of chicken and mushroom bits in the soup and it was hot (temperature).   The Chinese broccoli was excellent, the sauce wasn't generously drizzled on the broccoli which we preferred. The dish was a hit and i would've ordered that again if i came the next time.  The Shrimp dumpling (dim sum) was good, but not worth the price. It came lukewarm or not even warm. The dumplings were sticking with each other. but, nonetheless it was food.   Hot and sour soup was a hit for my mom and I. I liked it , there were lots of flavor and it gave a kick (spicyness).  I would order this again, but for 5 bucks for a cup is SUPER EXPENSIVE. the cup was not a big cup..so get a bowl if you're hungry.   the jelly fish was a slight dissapoint out of all the dishes we tried. It lacked flavor and it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it.   Overall, we had a good experience, it's legit chinese food that I missed while staying at LV. Definitely not like LA , but its vegas and food is not cheap. I still would come back and try their spicy beef noodle soup. yum!",

We arrived and to our surprise they were able to seat us right away.  They dropped off the menus and were ready to take our order within 1-2 minutes of seating us.  I asked the waitress of any dishes that she would recommend and she said \"I'll be right back\".  She came back about 5 minutes later and I asked her the same question again.  Her facial response was blank and all she could say was \"I cannot give you any recommendations.  Just order what you think you will like\"...  We ended up getting the Chicken mushroom ginger noodle soup, shrimp stir fry noodles,  and chicken wings.  Everything was OK.  The stir fry noodles tasted like the instant canton noodles that I ate as a child (an asian version of top ramen) and the wings were over cooked.",

They had a lot of shrimp in both the plates we had though!  Combination fried rice lack flavor, tasted slightly bland so we made up for it by adding soy sauce.  Overall, decent asian food for decent price in vegas!  Service could have been way better. We came on a summer weekday late after 11pm and it was about 20% filled so it wasn't packed.  Hostess/workers barely acknowledged us.",

I highly suggest an order of them. Light and crispy, so different than the normal buffet rangoons. The second is that my friend liked his. He got the shrimp and soft noodles.  Now on to mine. I got the vegetable fried rice. First of all, there had to be a three egg omelet in this thing and the egg was very brown. There was no flavor whatsoever. It was just oil. I added a ton of soy sauce and it just didn't help. Terrible. I will not likely go back. Maybe order crab rangoon and take them to go.",

This was not an extremely spicy soup, but it was tasty. We added a spoonful of the Sriracha they had on the table and the soup became AH-MAY-ZING. The added dimensions the sauce lended to the broth's flavor was unbelievable.",

But was insisted to eat here by Jeffrey that its pretty much best place to go for Asian food in Vegas.   We got seated fairly quickly and was given water and menus. I tried to find something that would help my \"hungover-fml-dont-wanna-move\" stupor and finally settled on the Szechuan beef noodle soup. The wait for our food was pretty fast and thank the lord for that bc i was starving and at 9pm, it was my first meal of the day ):  The soup itself has a slight kick to it which made it even yummier. The chunks of beef were soft and delicious as well and the noodles were chewy and filling! After inhaling that bowl of soup, it lifted that raging hangover and the \"holy shit i wanna die\" mentality. THANK YOU FOREVER omg.  My friend got the shrimp fried rice but it was kinda bland but the plate was HUGE  Prices are a bit high for quick chinese food, but i guess its vegas..... Overall will definitely come back here when i wanna kill myself from being hungover and in need of a soup!",

Even though the wait was 15 people deep, the wait was 10-15 minutes  I had the Sichuan beef noodles and asked them to add baby boo-Choy as an optional item. It was solid. Not the best bowl of noodles by SF standards but very good by Las Vegas standards. Great flavor. Tasty meat and I would highly recommend a vegetable addition to the soup noodle.

I'm assuming it's usually not super busy, but I came here during Lunar New Year weekend and it was crazy busy. Luckily people were in and out pretty fast so we didn't wait too long. Service was quick and easy, nothing exceptional. My friends and I all ordered the pho special prime. It's about the same price as the one at Treasure Island $18. They do give a huge serving as well with alot of soup. They do not however give alot of bean sprouts and veggies on the side. I also ordered the fried wings and they were really great! They were crispy and not that spicy. If you ever tried Albertson's zesty wings, it tasted like that.   Overall this is a solid place for Chinese food or pho, and would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The food can be rated at a four good all greasy, spicy, and fulfilling Asian food after a night of drinking in Vegas or a quick bite for lunch in a casual place.  I have been to Noodle Asia plenty of times over the years and always had the same experience, good food quick bite and good memories. Yesterday however was a completely different story. A HORRIBLE one!!!enough for me to write this review. I have a shellfish allergy, I always have Medication with me for safety and when dinning out I always ask the waitress for info on my meal if in doubt of an ingredient that can send me to the hospital. Last night I order a meal, NOT all ingredients were listed when I selected my meal, I stayed away from all things that can harm my health so noddles and beef.  When my meal came and I had one bite I notice my meal had a sauce, I asked the waitress if the sauce included OYSTER sauce since I know is very popular in the a lot of Asian dishes, she said YES. When I explained to her if it was ok to have my meal prepared again without the sauce she not only got upset but started lecturing me about eating vegetarian rolls because they where made in same oil as some seafood. She was rude, insensitive, and walked away refusing to take my plate back. She left it there for me to eat it, it wasn't until my boyfriend called her back and assured her we would pay for my meal to be made once again that she took my plate and asked the kitchen staff to remake it for me, but not without creating a scene. Not only did I cancel my second order because I felt so embarrassed but other guest got to experience a show, this waitress schooled me about how to take care of my health yet got angry when I was trying take care of it. I left the restaurant, SAD, EMBARRASSED, and HUNGRY. I can say I will never be back to this place.",

When the translucent white peppered gravy hits the noodles, it's euphoria.  Also, notable entrees are bbq pork and duck noodle soup, any of the fried rice entrees, and walnut shrimp.",

    "text": "3 of us walked into The Venetian after a show at Wynn looking for food. Wanted to try Black Tap, but the grill top wasn't working :( We saw Noodle Asia, and decided the menu looked really good. Fairly reasonable prices as well for a place on the Strip. I had Singapore Mei Fan; my sister had Miso soup & potstickers; my husband had Hong Kong Wonton soup. We shared Red Won Tons for a starter. WE ALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE RED WON TONS!! They have a mild sweet heat in the sauce and the wontons are very well done (there's 8 in an order, if I remember correctly). My sister had no complaints about the Miso soup and potstickers; their potstickers appear deep fried rather than steamed or pan fried and are larger than what you'd expect, about twice the normal size. Both my and my husband's meals were lacking flavor. I ended up pouring the remaining sauce over my Singapore noodles and after that it was quite good. HUGE portions. My husband added soy sauce and chili sauce to his and said it was \"ok.\" Neither of us is particularly eager to return. Pro tip: head west on Spring Mountain Rd for some authentic Asian eats!!!",

There's more bad food than great. I enjoyed all my soup. It was very good. As did my wife. This was one of the better places we ate at all weekend.  I've read the reviews here and I feel some are over complicated. \"I didn't get enough lettuce\" c'mon people. This was good soup. There are lots of places to get the high end treatment your reviews were sad about not getting.  1. Our staff that night was very nice.  2. The price was reasonable  3. Our soup was good. We got it fast and was hot and tasty.  There's a lot to be said about timing of your visit. It's True of any place you eat. It's busy things get rushed. Food and service as well as reviews.  You get mad because it's busy and took a while.  Your mad the server was a little short because your b**ching like the other people they're serving.  Eat your soups and go back to the slots Hahahaha  I will eat here again.",

Unfortunately the prices have also climbed up pretty high every time I visit as well.  They usually seat pretty fast, try not to come at the super peak times and you'll be alright.   I will usually get some noodle soup and it's well made.  I also love their open kitchen layout which you seldom see in Chinese restaurants.  You can see who is working on your food and their entire workspace!  I guess that helps hurry them up to make food quicker but the quality certainly doesn't lack.  Expect to pay around $20 per person at minimum when you come here.",

I came here for the 2018 Las Vegas Half Rock N Roll Marathon, and while it wasn't the best choice for pre-race food, I had the shrimp dumplings two hours before getting in the corral. I grew up eating dim sum and this food is worth traveling out of state for!!!  Be advised that because it's awesome, it's also super busy. The tables move fast because of the fast-paced atmosphere, I don't recommend this place to come chill and hang out. Get in, gorge yourself on deliciousness, and get back out there!

My BF and I arrived close to midnight and were seated promptly. We were in and out of there in about 30 minutes which is the time-frame we were going for. It's a sit-down restaurant that's quite busy for the most part but they get their food out quick.  When I saw how fast our order came out, I was worried that it was Panda-style, a bunch of pre-made stuff they just heat-up as you arrive. I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles and fried rice we ordered were fresh and very good. Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu. I will return for sure.",

Our order: -Shrimp and Chive Dumplings, fried $8.95 (4 pieces) I'm not a big eater so this usually does it for me. They are very flavorful but BEWARE! They are heavy on the chive! These are especially good when you cut them in half and put them in broth. TRUST ME.  -Hong Kong Won Ton Soup, large bowl $14.95 Personally, I don't care for this, but the BF loves it and it's all he orders when we're here. The broth, however, is really nice and I always make myself a little bowl to put my chive dumplings in.  I don't think the noodles are made fresh, personally. In fact, I don't know if they make anything in-house. I'll definitely ask the next time I'm there.  This place can get super busy since it's a very popular joint! They normally open at 11am during the weekdays and they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, so be prepared to wait in line!  4 stars because the prices are inflated, but hey, thats Vegas! LOL",

The chicken wings, the string beans, fried rice. The soy sauce chicken  and duck. And couple entrees.   Is like the salt is free. At the end I specifically tell the waitress please make sure don't make the noodles salty because is for my mom. When our table get cleaned up. When my to go arrived I want to open to taste to make sure not too salty the lady not sure if she is the manager? Or the hostess. She was standing there with her legs open and said out loud in Chinese she think I don't understand Chinese, she said; \"what was that suppose mean? What she was doing ? Why she is opening and eat the food? I said: the food is still too salty and my mom can not consume too much sodium  She said: you should have tell me upfront so I can fix everything for u. I said: what do you try to said now? It's my faults? She said: don't u rises your voice and u didn't need to give me bad attitude  I said: you are the one who gave me bad attitude first and what I did to u just to be fair  Then husband tell her we don't want it anymore and I don't need to see her sorry attitude toward to me like these!!! What's going on these day? Ppl doesn't know how to serve ppl right, and if that is the manager is she suppose talking to the customer like these ??? She could have asked in a nice way why I have to open the box and taste it but instead she was bitching at me why.... how's that my fault? I spent $134 for all the salty food without giving waitress any problems but instead I just tell the waitress to make sure not to make it too salty. How's that my fault?? Now I know why you guy have very low reviews because it's the manager who doesn't know how to serve customers right!!! This will be my last to eat here. Will not recommended this place to anyone!!!

The spicy level was pretty good - spicy enough to still taste the flavors and enjoy the food. It came with thicker egg noodles that were cooked perfectly - not too hard and not too chewy. Everything was great except they gave a loot of fat in their beef pieces, maybe its because we came at like 1:30am and they ran out of good meat, but there were pieces that were straight up just fat. Its also waaay overpriced for Chinese food. Pho was $18!! Our Szechuan spicy beef noodle soup was on the slightly cheaper side at around $13, cheaper but definitely not worth the price. My friend also got a small cup of hot and sour soup for $6! The food here is good but too expensive.",

I had no complaints--it had a full body flavor that was enhanced by a touch of ginger and the slow cooked, fried pork chop just added to the broth flavor of my meal. The only negative--not spicy at all! It was also disconcerting to be served a noodle dish without any toppings, but I do understand that hoisin sauce, thai basil, bean sprouts, and other condiments could just be a western cultural thing when it comes to noodle soups. My friend ordered the Spicy Ying Nan rice noodle and from what she said, it was spicy!  Overall, the only real negative comment about this restaurant was their rushed service. As soon as we were seated, our waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to order--we had just sat down and didn't even get a chance to look at the menu! Besides that, the water took a long time to be brought to our table as well.",

The location is bomb. Food is bomb (when you are slightly inebriated). Service has something to be desired. I realize that they have to deal with drunk people all day and night BUT I WAS SOBER.   My problem is with the service. Not once did someone come to refill our waters. I happened to down my water in the first 5 minutes at the table. YES I was hungover. YES my mouth was like the Sahara desert. Everything was pretty do it ourselves including getting our bill. Had to flag down 2 different people just to get our ONE bill.  This is the part that gets me. When the lady came by with our check she handed it to us then proceeded to STARE US DOWN AND BREATH ON US until we put a card in and returned it to her. UM.. can we please get a minute to ourselves since we had to give you 10 minutes to even get this to us? Life isn't always fair I guess. Then the lady returned WITHOUT the credit card we had put in it but with somebody else's signed receipt. The only thing that could make the service worse at this point was if she started eating off of our plates.   I'm glad the service was nonexistent when we needed it but the minute we wanted to pay everyone was at our table, not always with the right checks but at our table nonetheless. That really sealed the deal. Glad you took the time out to make us so uncomfortable and unwanted so I could reflect it in your tip.   BTW. I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY WATER TO BE REFILLED, even after you stood at our table for a full 5 minutes. Glad you wanted me to die from my MSG induced coma!",

    "text": "Located inside The Venetian, Noodle Asia is apparently a very convenient place for people to fulfill their soup craving after a whole night of drinking and dancing, especially Asians.  Like what I just said, we found our way to Noodle Asia after checking-out on Sunday after drinking and dancing til 4am and sleeping for like 2-3 hours.  We didn't expect to get cheap and good China-Town-noodle-soups, but NOodle Asia definitely didn't disappoint us.  They have many different types of Chinese noodle soups, Dim Sum, Appetizers, and other dishes like rice and fried noodles which I didn't look at. We ordered Ha Cao and Xiu Mai from Dim Sum. The Xiu Mai came out pipping hot. It was VERY good. All of us love it very much.  We then waited soooooooo long for the Ha Cao to come out. The Ha Cao was Okay in my opinion. The shrimps inside were very fresh and cooked just perfect; however, the skin outside was a lil over-cooked, so it was kinda powdery and a lil bit mashed. The good Ha Cao skin should be a bit chewy.   We then waited very long again for our noodles to come out. 2 wonton noodle soups for my cousins came out first. And about 5 minutes later, my wonton soup came out. i seriously don't understand why it took them longer to make my wonton soup while mine was exactly like my cousins' wonton noodle soups without the noodles. It didn't make any sense to me. But anyway, the soup was very good. The broth is clear. Wonton seemed to be freshly made. I tried the noodles from my cousin, and they were cooked just right. Very good.   The other 2 girls ordered spicy beef noodle soups. The beef was very tender. Lots of meat also. They like it.   Service meets standard. The place looks clean and modern which is no surprise because it is located in the Venetian :)  This is definitely a good place for soups without going anywhere far. I would recommend Noodle Asia to open 24/7 if they haven't done so because apparently after getting out of XS at 4am, all we think about is a bowl of soup (if you're still awake enough to think)",

The soup noodles are nicely chewy and definitely worth getting.  The wok-fried noodles are also tasty and crispy.  The stir-fried baby bok choy were delicious.  Some other items weren't so good - the pot stickers were full of holes and the Shanghai rice cakes were swimming in oil.  The worst item was the beef ... way over-tenderized.   Hey Yan-can-cook!  Take it easy on the baking soda next time!",

This really hit the spot when we were in the Venetian and starving but didn't want to spend $50 a pop for dinner. It was also still serving even though it was 11pm. We had a group of 6 and were sat right away, and comfortably. I got the spicy shrimp and pork udon, which was very good. Overall, I wasn't impressed with their soft noodles - they were a bit to thick and not al dente in texture. Tasted fine, but I just prefer a different style. We also got spring rolls, lo mein type dish, and edamame. I'd recommend stopping by if you're looking for something reasonable! Great late-night option.",

Did it blow our minds? No. But we really had a good dinner here after our drive to Vegas.  We started with a BBQ Pork Appetizer which was very good. For my entree I had a cup of Wonton Soup (wasn't that hungry).  Mr R ordered Cha Tsai which were veggies with pork over noodles.  It was a lot of food, fine service, and a really easy spot to grab a bite at the Venetian.",

I have had it in different corners of the world and will always order it if it's available. So when I was planning my Vegas trip, I had to do a search for it and wouldn't you know, Noodle Asia popped up all nice and affordable ($14 really is over-priced but for Vegas, it's affordable).  NA's gets the flavor precisely right with just the perfect mixture of soy sauce and chili pepper. Furthermore, the beef is in chunks as it should be and incredibly tender, so you know it's been stewing forever. The noodles were my favorite kind, thick and flat. The only thing missing were the vegetables. Not the pickled garnish but the bok choy (or sometimes spinach). No vegetables included. That makes my healthy voice sad.  The shu mai were quite good, considering we were eating at 1am. And my boyfriend's Dan Dan noodles were spicy, brothy, peanut-y delicious. They did not hold back on the accompaniments. The potstickers were cold and gross. Don't order those.  Yay! I can now put a pin on Las Vegas on my beef noodle soup world map. The pin means \"go back here\".",

    "text": "Unfortunately I am one of those Asian that cannot live without noodles for more than 48 hours.  I go to Vegas via plane, it is a short flight from OC so very convenient.  But that means my noodle resources are limited in the strip hotels.  So I pretty much tried all the noodle restaurants on the strip, and I can only sum up with one word - #$%^&.  Yeah, most are that bad!  Overpriced, terrible attitude, small portion, terrible food.  The only exception is this one. They cannot compare to 626 or OC noodle shops but they do have the best quality on the strip.  More importantly, their staff are all very helpful and smiley.  The lady serving us took five minutes to explain most of their popular noodles, that was unheard of.  So even though this place is a little far from my hotel, I always make a point to go there.  Trust me, if you want noodle, and you are limited on the strip, then don't think, this is your only place. But if you have a car, then the options are wide open, think China Town....",

    "text": "Considering the location in The Venetian, on The Strip where everything is grossly overpriced, I think only the most jaded Chinese food super critic could give this place less than 4 stars.  There are VERY FEW places ON THE STRIP in one of the MAJOR HOTELS that isn't a complete rip-off (aside from the Food Court places.)  This is one of those very few.  We had Hot and Sour Soup, Stir Fried Soft Noodles with BBQ Pork, Mu Shu Pork, Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice, Brocolli Beef. Not the best Chinese food I've had, definitely, but solid, good Chinese food.  The beef in the broccoli beef was a bit fatty so I wouldn't recommend that one.  Best of all, portions were large enough for the 3 adults and two teens to share family style and we were stuffed with a little leftovers at the end.  And for The Strip, prices were very reasonable - most in the $13-17 range so with beverages (two of them alcoholic) the bill for the 5 of us was under $100 (not including tip.) Practically unheard of on the strip for in-hotel semi-upscale dining.  Service was good too, although the place was only about 1/3 full when we ate there so YMMV.  The atmosphere of the place is semi-upscale casual and it's in the casino with a nice view of the screens in the sport book through huge glass windows so bonus you can watch the game(s) while eating. One of the better finds I've discovered on the strip.",

As soon as we sat down, we were rudely instructed to rearrange our seating for reasons I'm still not sure of. Then, the waitress taking our order was very short and frankly extremely rude. But that was nothing compared to our server. Instead of asking my 12-year old little cousin to move her glass of water, he rolled his eyes, shook his head and moved it himself. All he had to do was ask. It would've been a very simple request. At the very end, they asked for a tip on top of the gratuity that came with the bill. So in total, it was a really bad experience. All we wanted to do after a long day was to enjoy a nice meal to end it. I understand that it's a really busy restaurant but I also work in customer service and I've never ever treated a customer the way we were treated tonight regardless of the situation. We won't be returning.",

As I took my time to take a look at the bill before I signed, the waitress immediately came and told me, \"No worries. You don't have to sign. It's been taken care of.\" as she tried to take the slip away from me. Turns out, she already faked the tip in writings on the slip, and she charged tips on my card already. I had to demand her to give me back the slip before I removed the tip completely and signed my name. I was going to tip her in the first place but this fraudulent and stealing behavior completely ruined our experience. The food is fine but I will NOT come back again for such low practice!!!",

    "text": "Every time I am genuinely surprised by how legit this place is!  Of course, I've had my share of coming here at 2am on Saturday nights and I usually end up going with my default, the beef noodle soup, but this time around I went for lunch and actually got to try a bunch of different items from the menu.  First the beef noodle soup is good.  It has a good amount of kick and the brisket has been braised long enough so it's tender.  Portion's a little small but it is always satisfying.  If you like rice, YangChow fried rice is the way to gooo.  You can definitely tell that it's been wok-ed in a super hot wok and oil glistens on every rice kernel.  Lots of BBQ pork and diced veggies.  You can even make it spicy if you request it!  As for other noodles, black pepper beef udon is great if you love peppery flavors.  It's not black pepper sauce that you see from most cafes in LA but actual cracked black pepper.  Shanghai noodles has a little bit of curry powder in it and loaded with shrimp and other goodies.  Of course can't go wrong with the wonton soup either.    For me, I'm just really surprised at how... authentic or as authentic as it can be.  I mean, it sits right next to the casino and the sports book.  Usually spots like these are reserved for a crappy deli or something.  Definitely nice to have something like this when you've had Grand Luxe so many times!  It is a bit overpriced and be prepared to wait around noon, dinner, or late night.  It's not a big place!",

The noodle soups, porridge, nian gao and the shrimp xo lai fen are good. The first night we ate there, JH, B and I got there first..ordered our food. Our friend M came by a bit tipsy and cleaned up B's noodle soup. I guess it was pretty darn good to him.

They were very good and overall tasted a lot like home cooking --- nicely sliced cabbage and lots of black mushroom.  Just a little more chicken and maybe a little less oil, and I would call the dish excellent.  The second time, I had the Szechuan Beef Noodles; it usually doesn't come with any vegetables, so I asked for some to be added -- $2 extra.  The noodles had a nice, fresh texture.  The beef was also very good, tasty chunks of some non-steakhouse cut cooked until even the little bits of embedded tendon were tender.  It was moderately spicy, but only maybe a weak New Mexican medium.  Of course, I could have bit into the little red chilis for more heat.  The soup was just okay --- a noticeable soy sauce taste and not enough beef taste.  The dish was good enough to enjoy, but next time I'll try something else on the menu.  For a moderately priced Chinese restaurant at a hotel on the Strip, this place is very good.",

I have had everything from the shanghai style rice cake and noodle, beef chow fun, beef szechuan noodle soup (Mama Wu's special), spicy cucumber, jelly fish, seafood curry noodles,  and at least three of the fried rice dishes.  This is my favorite noodle place in Vegas and is one that I usually go to at least 2-3 times when I'm out there.  Its open from the 10am till 3am so you can get your favorite chinese food whenever you want.  The line is usually long, however, they do have a carry out.  The people that work there are pretty much the same people for the at least the past three years or so.  The service is excellent and they know what they are doing.  Whenever someone asks for good chinese food, I always recommend Noodle Asia.  The dishes lean more on the real chinese dishes.  Which means you won't find dishes like general tso's chicken or sesame beef on the menu.  However, it should be a must-try if you are serious about food.  Can get slighly oily at times but that should be expected.  Oh, did I say the portions are large?  Slightly more expensive than say chinese off the street but well worth it for a noodle house in a great hotel next to the sportsbook.",

Didn't want to try anything else?\"  \"Noodle Asia's good.\"  That about sums it up. It's the only Chinese I've had on the Strip that actually caters to Asians and doesn't orange chicken-up or gourmet bland-out the food. In 626 it might have to work a little harder, but in Vegas it hits the spot when you want a Chinese restaurant meal. Both noodle dishes were excellent, the Buddha Feast (veggie) Pan-Toasted and the Combo Stir-Fried Soft. BBQ Pork was tender, spring rolls crisp, fried rice clean.",

We ordered some Dim Sum items, Braised Beef Noodle Soup, and Fried Rice. It was all tasty and very affordable. For the reviews that say it's too pricey here... I disagree. Its hard to find Asian food on the strip this authentic and affordable. They also give you hella big portions!   Delicious, authentic, affordable and opened late? Can't beat that.",

I get extremely excited when my friends want to come eat here during a Vegas trip.  They also serve a great Vietnamese iced coffee, Thai iced tea, and they have fresh coconuts too.  You cannot go wrong with their noodle soups.  I think this place is known for their wonton soup but I like them all.  I had the bbq pork and roasted duck egg noodle soup and I was scared that the soup would de-flavor my bbq pork but it did not.  I love roast duck and BBQ pork and was surprised that I could find both of my favorite meats inside of a soup, and I LOVE soups!!   The congee is also cooked to a good consistency and you can taste a hint of ginger in each bite, and I normally don't even like ginger.  The tea eggs were also very yummy  We tried the orange chicken just for the heck of it but it was wonderful, crispy and flavored very well!    Expect each entree to be a little pricey, but what do you expect when you're eating comfortably in your hotel.  Even though this place is pricey, they sure do their best to make it worth it.",

Usual Asian cuisine is a good road to go down to get GF food.   Of their unbelievably limited selection of GF items, I chose the Broccoli and Chicken because I am a moron. It was literally the blandest meal I have ever eaten. Almost entirely devoid of spice, the chicken had a boiled unpleasant texture. The broccoli was lazily steamed. I ate it anyway because it was late and I didn't have time to find another place. Gross. At least it was healthy. 1 star for that. I was too demoralized to send it back. I just sat there and ate it like a loser. Pathetic. Now I hate myself.  Maybe their breaded deep fried gluten food is yummy.   The waitress was nice. That gets them a star.  Changing my review to 1 star because I was hungry 20 minutes later and had eat a second meal.",

Firstly, our server (won't mention name) was VERY rude.  She would not give us enough time to even look at the menu and kept coming back as if she was trying to rush us out. The food was terrible. Ordered Shrimp Fried Rice and asked them to make it spicy and make sure to add veggies. That came out with no flavor and an additional $4 for \"extra\" veggies - which would have been just had there been actual extra veggies. Also ordered Kung Pao Chicken, again asked for spicy, and it came in some sticky sweet sauce and tasted absolutely awful. So overall, meal was garbage. Service was garbage. Upon questioning the additional charge, the same server VERY rudely explained to us that it's for the rice. We said we didn't care about the charge, we'll pay it because we wanted to gtfo.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.",

We came to the podium entrance to put in our to go orders. The waitress did give suggestions on what to order if we liked spicy dishes, wanted to know popular dishes, etc. She also let us know that it would take 30 minutes for our order, but we decided to wait for it because we wanted some soup! I ordered the won ton noodle soup and swapped the noodles for vermicelli noodles. I believe the total was about $12. When I got my dish, I didn't think it was worth $12 to be honest but then I guess it's food on the Strip so it's overpriced lol. The wontons were made of shrimp and pork I believe. The noodles were so soggy and there was barely any broth because our to go food was just sitting at the counter and not given to us when it was ready. I had to check with the waitress to see when it would be done for her to realize it had been sitting there. I'm not sure if I'd come back.",

It was clean and there was a nice view to the mostly open kitchen and woks. The service was decent, a little slow, but I've come to expect that anywhere when I'm a party of 1 sitting alone.   I ordered crab rangoons and the Szechuan beef noodle soup bowl. The rangoons were very good. I watched them come out of the fryer so they were definitely fresh.  Imitation crab as almost all are, but there was plenty of it as well as smooth cream cheese and chives. The dipping sauce was also good. The noodle bowl LOOKED really good. It had a pungent smell, overwhelming with Chinese 5 spice. The noodles were cooked perfectly, but the beef and broth tasted not at all fresh.",

The shrimp dumplings were delicious however . Huge pieces of shrimp. The beef with rice noodles was equally good. The dish was full of tender pieces of beef and the noodles.... each one kissed by the pan. Service is fast and attentive. The nails approve! Hours are wonderful as well. 11am to 3 am. Um Kay!",

At lunch, there was about a 15 minute wait around 2 pm on a Friday afternoon...I stayed at the Bellagio and wanted something sit-down but not too fancy and this seemed to fit my description.  When we were finally seated, our server was plain rude. I know she was busy and in a hurry but she was pretty nasty. She was very impatient, snappy, and didn't really provide the greatest service all around.  We ordered the soy-beef noodles and Mandarin Chow Mein - I liked the chow mein much better than the soy-beef noodles. Maybe I don't really like soy but I didn't love the flavor of these. It was very unusual for chinese food (to me) and I wasn't crazy about it. Mine was much better although very generic and Americanized. It was tasty - but not of super high-caliber quality. The food was definitely filling and the portions were big - we were hoping to take this back to our room but unfortunately the Bellagio did not have a fridge in our room to store our leftovers.   I can't recall the final price of our lunch but remember thinking it was pretty expensive for what it was. If you're looking for something other than bar food, I MIGHT recommend it if you can't find anywhere else to go. And with the millions of options on the strip, I'm sure you could find a better place than this.",

Ordered the beef noodle soup- I mean, afterall it is Mama Wu's specialty.  It came out piping hot which was great but then after the temperature subsided the unpleasant saltiness slapped me in the face.  That's all I could taste after that.

The beef noodles soup was perfect for my friend who was nursing a cold.  It was a great balance of spiciness, heat, and flavor.  The meat was pretty good too, just kinda fatty.  I expected more from the Dan Dan Noodles.  It was just a cold monotonous flavor of peanut butter and minced meat. Guess, I'll have to try different items next time I'm in The Venetian and wanna give this a try.",

At the convenience of being inside Venetian, I really can't complain, but $13 for a bowl of beef porridge is a little ridiculous. I must admit, from the menu items I have tried, they are all pretty decent except for the soup, especially the Egg Flower Soup. The soup tasted worse than the imitation Egg Flower Soup at a Chinese buffet. I was a big fan of the Sze-Chuan Beef Noodle and the Ba Bao noodles though, just not the price tag. But again, we are in Vegas, so I can't really complain.   For the most part, Noodle Asia satisfies my craving for Asian noodles while in Vegas, especially after a night of partying, and I am thankful for it's existence.",

After another 5 minutes, we got the hostess' attention.  It still took another 5 minutes before the drinks appeared.  15 minutes for water?  That's bad.  We then ordered our food.  Another 15 minutes go by.  Two separate groups of Chinese guests are seated in the interim (including one group of 12+). They order and receive their all of their food before anything of ours comes out.  They are literally being served at light speed.  We are still sitting at an empty table.  That's very bad.  So we finally get our food after about 35 minutes of waiting and watching everyone around us, including those who came afterwards, get their food first.  I can't speak for what anyone else ordered, but the orange chicken ($19) was atrocious.  Watery, lukewarm, and not flavorful at all.  The \"jasmine rice\" was badly overcooked white rice.  The spring rolls were terrible.  If the food were just mediocre and overpriced, I'd give the place 2 or 3 stars for convenience alone (it's in the middle of the casino) but I really was not impressed with how horrible the service was.  It wasn't busy or late at night; there were no extraneous circumstances.  They just decided that they would serve everyone else (who just so happened to be Chinese) first, and keep us waiting.    So now, I will decide to never eat here again.",

We were supposed to fly out the following day but we got so sick that we had to reschedule our flights for the next day and had to stay an additional day at the Venetian costing us over $400 total.

I'm not feeling too well and the weather doesn't make it any better. I was in deep need of soup.  I started to think of where I could possibly walk to on the strip that had noodle soup and luckily enough -- I saw the Venetian map where someone already pulled up the restaurant options, and low and behold: Noodle Asia!   I could not have been anymore happier than in that moment.  Upon arriving, right on their stand was their special for the day \"Convention Special\" featuring 8 curry fish balls, won ton noodle soup AND Vietnamese coffee.  I was like \"ok, now I'm more sold and more in love\".  Now about the food: BEST WON TONS I'VE EVER HAD. EVER. Even the noodles were amazing and I'm not usually a fan of yellow noodles. Broth was good too, but as usual I had to add chili paste to it -- only because I love spicy -- it could have been a great soup without it.  I'm a big Vietnamese coffee fan and this I loved too!   Now I don't have much to say about the curry fish balls only because I'm actually not a fan personally of curry fish balls. Curry alone -- I love. Fish balls alone -- I love. But I just can't get the two to go well in my mout together.  Anyways -- great portions. They have a bar so people eating by themselves can be seated quickly. I'm super stuffed.  Now I must leave because I'm done eating and the line is getting long.",

But, since their renovation a couple of years ago, the quality seemed a bit off.  For starters, my old favorite, red wonton, has consistently been bland, chewy, and sometimes even on the cold side where the wontons are actually lumpy.  Other dishes such as spicy Ying-Nan noodles are inconsistent, ranging from missing ground beef, to scallions, to the chilly.  My latest visit, this past weekend, was a HUGE disappointment.  My Young-Chow fried rice was wet, sticky, lacking the distinct wok flavor this particular dish is known for.  The shrimps also seemed \"off\", with a squishy bite.  There were literally six diced char siu (I counted).  No scallions, and hardly any presence of eggs.  Most of all, it was just flat and flavorless.   It really is too bad.  This was once my favorite noodle place where I have recommended many friends, colleagues and families whenever they visit Venetian.",

I tapped the hostess on the shoulder, just as the people in the front of the line turned to look at their Iphones and asked her if we could sit at the empty counter. She must have witnessed the fire in my eyes cause we were seated moments later.   Wontons were solid!! Served in a bowl with a lot A LOT of sauce, they were moist, delicious and were gone in moments.   I ordered up the pan fried noodles and beef and that's my mistake. It appears as though they make noodles in house and I should have order Pho! I saw a few bowls hit the counter for service and knew I made a terrible mistake.  My pan fried noodles and beef were pretty good. The Mongolian Beef, ordered by my bride-to-be was much tastier. She loved my dish, I loved hers. That's a huge plus right there.   For the cost, it's a solid value spot. Not a dive, not fancy pants.   They are right next to the sports book and the entire building is one giant window. So, if you choose a table correctly, you can enjoy some food and a game at the same time.",

Today, I got to experience his description of \"Oooo, it's so good!\" noodle shop for the first time. This place is a fairly reasonably priced Cantonese/Chinese quick eats! Everything is done simple, but well. Portions are nice, quality of food is excellent, ingredients are True to its price point. Most importantly, very yummy, unpretentious authentic local street food cooking in the beautiful Venetian Hotel.  Great place for lunch or a quick bite. Not a formal sit down. Happy Eating!",

This review is based on the following dishes:  Kung pow chicken, orange chicken, night kitchen fried rice, and stir fry vegetables. Of the list, the orange chicken and vegetables were the best but still average. The fried rice was the most disappointing. The beef was very rare (red color) and flavorless. The dish shows a picture of a chile but there was no flavor. Not spicy at all. The peppers in it looked like jalapenos but tasted like bell pepper. Kung pow was ok only. Very few veggies almost all chicken and peanuts.   I would have been happier at Panda Express.",

There really was not a whole lot of people when I came, so got sat down at a table right away.  The ladies that worked there were very nice.  I decided on getting the bbq pork and roast duck over rice which sticker shocked me at $15.  OUCH!  The food came in 3 minutes.  I am not even joking with you, it literally came out in 3 minutes.  I sent a text out, and the food was there.  Also ordered a Vietnamese Iced coffee.  The food was not impressive.  The roast duck pieces had nothing but skin on them.  Absolutely no meat.  Maybe they saw that I was an Asian guy and they felt that I had enough roast duck in my lifetime and know how it taste like so they are saving it for those that might not have tried it before.  COMPLETELY understand (not really)!  The bbq pork was BRIGHT pinkish/red which almost blinded me.  I think they glazed it intensely, which actually was not too bad.  The rice was eh...rice.  The coffee was not as strong as I'm accustomed to, but was pretty good.  All and all, not worth the 23 dollars total.  Maybe if you look like you've got money, they'll give you the duck with the meat on it though.  Good luck.",

Even while in the Military, when I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan, I would try only the stuff I was used to and knew.  When I started working as a Technical Sales Engineer that requires traveling to a lot of places and sometimes going to restaurants that aren't really my style. One of them being Asian food. I have learned to adapt to the Asian food that I come across.  When I am traveling to Las Vegas for work there is always one restaurant that I try to make time to visit. Noodle Asia Restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat. Above, is one of the first meals I tried here because again, I was afraid to try anything I wasn't used to. I figured, \"How can I go wrong with Kung Pao Chicken?\" They serve you a lot of chicken and peanuts. (Food Allergy Folks Beware!)  I have gotten used to eating some of the other items on the menu but Kung Pao Chicken is still one of my favorites.",

Noodle Asia has always hit the spot when I'm in Las Vegas and craving Chinese food.  I only wish they would open a tad bit later to let me wander in drunk fulfilling the craving for a hot bowl of won ton noodle soup.  For those thinking the high review is because of eating under influence that is not True.  I've been here drunk, sober, and hung over and all three circumstances Asia Noodle has always been good to me.  I even try to stay inside the Venetian or Palazzo just so I don't have to go outside and face the elements to get to my beloved Asia Noodle.  Won Ton Noodle Soup (with and without BBQ pork), Night Market Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, and the BBQ Combination Plate are my standard fare here.  On a side note, Asia Noodle recently got a facelift and looks a lot fancier than it did before.  For you sports fan nuts out there, they even have bar seating that faces the Cantor's sports book so you don't have to unglue your eyes from the game while eating.",

It shouldn't be a surprise that the prices here are sky high, but you just have to take one glance around and realize that the restaurant is inside the Venetian hotel on the Strip. You might do a double-take and see that yes, it's around $10-$13 for porridge, or $10 for wonton soup. Basically, whatever prices you're used to, just multiply by 2 for this place.  We ordered a wide assortment of dishes:  Seafood crispy pan fried noodles Wonton soup Seafood rice porridge Vegetable spring rolls Soy milk  I honestly thought everything was comparable to what I've had at like a Sam Woo cafe or something like that. Just double the price. Just good 'ol Chinese comfort food. Our total bill was $50. Pretty shocking, I know. Would I eat here if the food wasn't comp'd? Not a million years.

Rest assured this place actually feels like a classy hole in the wall.  I'm not sure how they achieved that but it's been done.  The spicy beef noodle soup tastes great.  Fat chunks of beef and the noodles are quite chewy.  But if paying a lot for NRM isn't your thing ($14 a lot)...and if you have a car, then you better run over to China town LV.",

    "text": "My absolute favorite Chinese Noodle restaurant in Las Vegas.  A \"go to\" place for me everytime I visit Las Vegas and stayed in Venetian Palazzo or Treasure Island.  They open until 3am, so a great place to unwind with some fantastic Chinese comfort food after a long day doing whatever that you were doing. At a reasonable price too.  The food reminds me of my days in Hong Kong. My favorite there are 1.Fried Pork Chop Noodle 2.Fried Chicken Wing,. they say it is spicy hot, it really it is not, unless you eat the hot pepper slices that garnish the dish. The wing itself is delicious, but the last order I had during the rush hours was over fried.  3. Won Ton Noodle Soup One thing to keep in mind while visiting this place is Noodle Asia is a casual noodle, chinese snack restaurant, kind of like an eat and run cafe.  The quality of the above are more often above average than not.  The location is just fantastic too.  It is right next to the sport book section of Venetian. It has a huge glass wall dividing the two, which means that you can eat your noodle, view your favorite sporting event, WITHOUT the smoke and noise that associates a normal sport booking location. What is not to like.  By the way, the service is excellent, but you do have to get their attention during rush hour just like any other good restaurant. But they do care.",

    "text": "A dear friend recommended this fine dining establishment, telling me about a certain dish which I shared a nommy sentiment. The restaurant is Chinese-themed, and it is called Noodle Asia, a few steps away from the casino floor is where you will find it.  The wait in line was somewhat time-consuming, so be sure to account for the wait when you are starving. This restaurant can accommodate parties large and small, if you are forever alone have a seat at the bar by the kitchen wall.  Their menu has many appetizing offerings, drinks, foods, and other delicious things. On the both occasions that I visited with my group, I got a pot of hot tea, and a bowl of the Sichuan beef noodle soup.  The service here was efficient, accurate, and brisk, our food order came out in about 10 minutes - nothing was amiss. The tea was what you'd expect from any ol' Asian joint, but oh my stars I must emphasize that the noodle soup was ON POINT.  The beef noodle soup had me speechless, the taste of the broth had the right mix of savory spices, the meat was exceedingly fatty, with a buttery texture, and the noodles brought the balance to bring the entire dish together.  All-in-all I'd say Noodle Asia is a must-try spot, primarily for the Sichuan beef noodle soup fresh from the pot. Make sure you give this place a whirl, as you wander about the City of Sin, looking for them hot girls. lolol.",

Being Asian, I'm insulted that the Venetian would attempt to placate me with this mediocre excuse for a Chinese restaurant sandwiched between the poker tourney area, sports book, and restroom hall.  KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) review:  Fried rice:  extremely oily and packed with MSG. Dim sum: nothing special except the price.  3x what you would pay in your local Chinatown. Noodle soups: correctly made, loaded with MSG, very little toppings, expensive. Wok tossed noodles: should be tossed out.  Extremely oily and salty from the MSG.  To add further insult, they charge you for every day quality tea.  We all know, too much oil = restroom.  Too much MSG = lots of water = restroom.  Not a smart way for a casino to do business.  But what do I know, I'm still in my MSG coma.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for Noodle Asia because I noticed long lines for this place while watching football games at the adjacent Venetian sportsbook.  Long lines are usually an encouraging sign at a restaurant so we decided to join the crowd.   If it is available on the menu, then I tend to be a creature of habit by ordering Kung Pao Chicken at practically every Asian restaurant I visit. This restaurant was no different. In a way, it's my barometer for judging Asian cuisine. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with their Kung Pao Chicken at all. The chicken was tough and dry while the sauce was clumpy and somewhat syrupy.  The texture to this sauce reminded me of melted caramel and not the typical thin Kung Pao sauce. The taste was mostly sweet and tangy rather than spicy. A strange taste for a Kung Pao dish.  It just was not enjoyable.  On the other hand, the shrimp stir fried noodles, potstickers, and won ton soup were great. My wife and I were really pleased with all these noodle dishes and how they were cooked, steamed and fried to perfection. All the vegetables, seafood and meat in these dishes were fresh and delicious. The cabernet sauvignon was a perfect complement to wash down all these dishes.   The service here was excellent.  We were constantly checked on and asked if we needed anything. I would also like to thank the hostess for seating my wife and I at a table that faced the sportsbook so I could continue to watch the football games without any interruption while enjoying our meal.   I am giving Noodle Asia three stars because they failed my Kung Pao Chicken test but excelled with the noodle dishes and service.",

We ordered the pineapple fried rice which was really plain and flavorless... I had to add a lot of hot sauce to it.  The Singapore noodles were alright but they were just way too greasy.

We have dined here several times especially for their delicious congee soup (rice porridge).  It's 1am in the morning and your craving Chinese food?  Well Noodle Asia is open till 3am.  A wee bit pricey but worth every penny.    After eating at Noodle Asia we always win several hundred.  It has happened twice in a row but can not guarantee for others:)  Highly recommend: Fish, seafood, beef and my favorite....fried scallop congee  Fiery fried chicken wings...has a little kick  Wrinkled Sauteed String Beans with sweet basil  Service is great, the cooks are loud and happy feels like we're in  China.   Next time we are around I will definitely try the Abalone Congee.  Their congee is low sodium for those who are health conscious.  I personally love it sinceit pairs well with all the other orders.  5 star for food and service our waitress was great.",

Our meal came with a very small bowl of rice. I didn't appreciate the pettiness of charging us more for something so small when we asked for a refill. And I took off a star for the lack of friendly service, although it was efficient. Overall we did get a decent meal in the Venetian for under $50 for two people which is a rarity.",

What raises their status in my opinion is that when I sit at the bar and ask the chef's to make the food in a certain manner, they always accommodate me.

The price is 50% higher (Venetian has higher rent than Gold Coast, obviously) but the food is the same and comes out really fast in 5 minutes or less.  Maybe it's just me but if I'm paying this much $$ at a restaurant I would like the chef or line cook to take a little extra time to make the dishes look 'instagram worthy' and hopefully taste good as well (but that's secondary in today's social media culture, no?)   As it is, the seafood crispy noodle tasted just okay, the mongolian beef too sweet, but that's just me -- your taste buds may vary.  Las Vegas Strip arguably has the best restaurants of every kind, but I opine its Chinese/Japanese/Korean offerings are still very lackluster.   The new Noodle Asia has done nothing to change that perception.",

Once it did it was disappointing to say the least, I would have to say panda makes better Asian food and it's twice as expensive here... then once we finished eating or tasteless food because we were starving (which normally would make anything taste good haha) we had to fight to get them to our table to pay the bill..... long story short don't waste your time or money with this place. Especially with so many good options in the area.",

I love the consistency in their dishes and everything is made fresh to order in their open kitchen. You can see all the cooks cooking your food in the hot fired woks. I've brought my best friend's entire bachelorette party here (some of them are Yelp elite) and all of them loved it here. It's a good sign when the food comes and NOBODY is talking to each other.   I've tried and loved their black pepper udon noodles- stir fried udon noodles in a soy sauce based sauce with LOTS of black pepper so this dish is spicy! It comes with tender pieces of fish and veggies. The chicken breast congee is really good here- I like it with the chili oil. Crab Rangoons are crispy filled with cream cheese and imitation crab meat. My other favs? Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and the jellyfish side order are all consistently good here. The portions are plenty. I love the jasmine tea to wash everything down.   Service here is quick and efficient. If you need anything they are fast to respond. I've never had an issue with the service here.   I highly recommend it and I will be returning whenever I'm in town.",

Feeling a little under the weather. I was looking for something simple like congee to settle my stomach.  We ordered the congee with dried scallops, a small order of soy sauce chicken, spicy won tons, and a boba milk tea.  The congee was ok, but not much flavor from the dried scallops.  The chicken was served cold and paired well with the congee .  The spicy won tons were good.    Service was a notch above what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant.  No complaints here, just don't set the bar too high and you won't be disappointed.  I'd go back to try some other dishes.  Prices were higher than we expected, but the food is authentic without having to drive off the strip.",

We ordered hot tea, Vietnamese coffee, chicken lettuce wraps, combination fried rice and the handmade noodles with shrimp dish.    The reviews are accurate in that it is kinda on the greasy side of Chinese food.  However, it does not taste like cheap greasy Chinese food.   I would add a star if there were more shrimp or even greens in the pan fried noodle dish.  There were many noodles left after we were done eating.    As far as prices goes... yes it is Expensive.

And since I was staying at the Venetian, this was the closest place to satisfy my craving.  It's located on the casino level near the slot machines.  At around 2pm on a Saturday there was no wait and we were seated quickly.  The restaurant is also next to the sports betting area, so if you're seated in the right spot you can watch the games on the big screens.  I didn't know what kind of soup I wanted, but their Szechwan Beef soup ($14.95) was listed as \"Mama Wu's specialty\".  It was delicious!  The broth was just the right combination of salty and spicy for me.  The beef was tender and the noodles had a nice chewy texture.  We also had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($13.95).  These were good, although on the salty side especially after adding the hoisin sauce.  I wish it had come with more than four leaves of lettuce.     If you're on the strip and need a Chinese food fix, this is a good option.  Yes, you're going to pay more than you normally would for Chinese food, but what isn't overpriced on the strip?",

That is exactly what we did. We were seated immediately. The restaurant was busy for 2:15AM.  I wanted to have the Young Coconut Water however they were out of it. We ordered the Beef Pho Soup & Lamb Chops. The soup was delicious and plentiful. The Lamb Chops were tender however not very flavorful. Service was fast and attentive.  Will absolutely go back to Noodle Asia again for a late night Pho fix when at the Venetian.",

The noodles were cooked well and flavorful. My only thing that would of made it better is if there was more pork in it. The potstickers were perfect! The meat had good flavor and the dough was thick with the right amount of crispness. Id definitely eat here again if I wanted a quick meal and didnt want fast food.",

Congee at Noodle Asia? Bingo.  Plus they had kimchi. Best combo when ill.   Their kimchi wasn't fermented/spoiled like I prefer but it still has the pungent strength to destroy symptoms. Trust. It's good meds w/jjuk (or congee since we're here).  Too, their teapot is generously filled with teabags (plural - yes) so all was in his favor :) MMM hot brewed oolong teabags. I'm a fan.  Nothing wrong with this casual eatery sit-down location next to the Race & Sports Booking area of the Venetian. Being next to it actually kept us visually entertained.",

I had to pick out all of the red peppers because my lips were burning and mouth was on fire from every single bite.   What I didn't like was that we didn't even order tea, but they brought it for the table and charged each person for a cup. The sad part was that not everyone even touched their tea cups. What an easy way to make money huh?  Overall, I was impressed with the beef noodle soup. I usually don't eat a lot, but I was able to finish the whole bowl. I feel like the portion was too small because it is really expensive for a bowl of noodles. Oh well, everything is expensive on the strip I feel.   Craving the noodles right now... =(",

Well my group was feenin for some noodle soup but not crappy pho so we decide to come here.   To be perfectly honest this place wasn't even that bad.  I obviously eat asian food on a daily basis and of course not the best, eh you can't really complain given the demographic and the fact that you're in Vegas.   Order the Schezuan noodles, i believe it was the first one under the noodle soup section.  Yes it is $14.00 but don't bitch, its by far the best noodle soup dish, dark broth think oily star anise, tender chunks of beef, some not so much as the others. My friends ordered other noodle soups and mine was by far the best, with the most complex savory tasting broth, scoop in lots of hot sauce, bomb! I just wish the broth was hotter and the meat was more tender, but beggers can't be choosy.    Schezuan noodles + lemonade (free refills) = $20. But if you don't feel like going to chinatown and you're craving some pretty decent asian noodle soup with actual asian dudes (*gasp) cooking in the open kitchen, then come to Noodle Asia.",

This place was disgusting. I wish I can give this place several negative stars. I bet prison food probably tastes better than what these people are trying to conjure up.   The service sucked, the sprite or 7up was watered down, food was gross and it was expensive. The service was slow, drinks weren't refilled, they didn't check on you once to ask you how everything was, you have to wave many times to get someone's attention for the check (get me the hell outta there ASAP!), even though I said that the soda tastes weird (I had a cold mind you but I could still taste how there wasn't enough syrup) and that the syrup was probably low, it didn't matter because the drink lady sure didn't change it or care and I couldn't understand what the hell words was coming out of her mouth. Maybe I should have tried to speak in her native tongue and we could have gotten somewhere.   The food was so bland and oily. I've made better soup the first time I attempted to make it and I'm no cook either! The chicken soup with veggies (forgot what it was called but it was one of the more expensive ones per the server's suggestion) was mainly water broth, noodles, and veggies all thrown into a bowl. I should have known something was up when the only things on the table spruce up the food was soy sauce and chili paste. Seriously? We also ordered the beef stir-fry noodle which was also tasteless. The beef, however was tender and good. Why does it have to be so OILY though? To try and mask their terrible attempt at Asian cuisine?   Don't be duped into going here just because the people that work there (yes, including the cooks) were Asian like we were! Seriously, $40 for bland soup and chowfun? I was starving and I still couldn't force myself to finish 3 bites of the soup. I seriously contemplated on sticking a note on their menu that's outside their restaurant to warn potential customers of their business. (shaking head with arms crossed) Boo and shame on you Noodle Asia! )=P `~  BEWARE: DO NOT ENTER FOR RISK OF TERRIBLE FOOD! What? I had to at least put it in caps and put it strategically at the very top and bottom of my review. Just in case though....  BEWARE: DO NOT ENTER FOR RISK OF TERRIBLE FOOD!",

By legit, I mean all the staff tha works here are Chinese, including the cooks.    I had the beef noodle stew, which came with preserved cabbage and large chunks of beef, some dense feeling hand tossed noodles, and a really really good broth base.  Perfect for hangovers.  My girl had the preserved egg and pork porridge.  It tasted almost as legit as my mom's.  We shared the bok choy with oyster sauce, which was perfectly boiled.    The only thing is that this place is pretty expensive.  Our bill was almost fifty dollars, for what would cost only fifteen to twenty in Chinatown somewhere.  But, keep in mind you are eating in the Venetian.    PROTIP:  Large portions, so share!",

    "text": "(Lets see how many times I can say noodles in this review of Noodle Asia)  Noodles (1) in the Venetian is a tasty retreat for asian flare. When I was in Vegas for work a friend of mine said this place was really good and by the looks of the review everyone feels the same. The part that throws me off is the price. When I saw 2 $ signs I was like \"really\"? When it's $12 for mai fun noodles (2) you got to ask yourself, is this made in china then flown to Vegas to charge $12?   Since it's called noodles (3) I ordered other noodles (4). What I do like about Noodles (5) is that they have noodle (6) dishes from all over asia, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese so it makes for a good variety of noodles (7) if you're sharing food.   Parking? Who needs parking when there's valet?   Service? Who needs service when there's ..... dang....  Well if you're in the Venetian and you feel like grabbin some noodles (8) then check out Noodles (9), bring a check and right it out to Noodles (10).  ....noodles (11).....  Enjoy!  p.s. For an asian restaurant their phone number is extremely unlucky.",

    "text": "Been here 5 times.. My parents introduced me to this place while they were staying in the Venetian for the weekend. The restaurant is right next to the sportsbook and casino floor. I was skeptical at first \"probably commercialized tasting..\" But they proved me very wrong.  our 3 consecutive orders:  Small Cantonese BBQ Plate ( bbq pork only): Even the small could feed quite a few people. Served as rectangular slices, tender, juicy and their sauce was Awesome. When I want bbq pork (chinese style) I usually make a run to Sam Woo in China town. But I must say, I would drive the extra miles and walk the extra steps from the self park or valet, to have Noodle Asia's bbq pork any day!! One of the best I've had!   Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice: I love the fact that it Comes with Egg Whites. They also add really thin slices of chinese broccoli that gives the dish a little snap to it. Not only does this simple dish have tremendous flavor, nice soft and crunch texture, it was visually appealing!! (Think X'mas Fried rice: White Rice, like snow.. Chinese sausage, red in color.. Chinese broccoli, green in color..) One of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had! By the way I'm Filipino, I live off rice and have had Many Many different variations of it..  Hong Kong Wonton: Broth very light flavor, noodles thin (like angel hair pasta) and wontons are typical but satisfying. A nice way to start off a meal.   ordered once:  Roast Duck: rich duck flavor, meat's consistency like chicken and skin abosorbed the sauce. Tasty!  Szechwan Beef noodle soup: dark clear broth, had a spicy note to it but did not linger. Beef were cut into good sized cubes, meat soaked in the wonderful broth flavors and were filling. Thick noodles went perfect with the meat.   Prices are a bit Steep, Service is Good and Food a Solid 4 Stars! Lesson Learned, Not to Judge a Book by its Cover! May not be totally Authentic but their refined take on the food was definitely a positive one!",

    "text": "I usually get comp rooms at the Venetian/Palazzo so I typically gamble long hours at these 2 places. I have eaten at Noodles Asia a few times due to it being a chinese restaurant and also getting comped food from the pit boss.   First time I asked for a comp for 2, pit boss told me that I had $86 to blow at Noodles Asia. I was floored! I never eaten here before and was wondering how 2 people can spend $86 in a chinese restaurant, when we did not plan on ordering Shark's Fin, Abalone, Bird's Nest, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, Sea Cucumber, you know the drill.   But Yes We Can, at Noodles Asia apparently. The food isn't great, heck, I would go to Ping Pang Pong over at Gold Coast over this place anyday. But I absolutely adore the fact that they have Chicken Mushroom Ginger Soup. Oh this is the reason why I go there. The rest are just for formality. Dim dum mediocre, Fried Rice Oily, Noodles not asian enough.   In fact, last Saturday, I got drunk playing Baccarat at MGM HL room and got back to the Venetian and decided to have one bowl of soup. Sure it costs $10.95, sure it's still not that good, but it is to me the best item on this menu, and that is good enough reason for me to keep coming back.  For better dim sum and chinese food in general, head over to Bellagio's Noodles if you want a casino setting, or Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast. Otherwise head over to Chinatown",

I gave noodle Asia the benefit for the doubt and went a 2nd time in June and this is by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVER had ANYWHERE. My gf and I just about hurled our food when we tasted it and at 45 bux for 2 it was beyond overpriced. Hell I wouldn't pay 5 bux for the plate.   The wonton soup was disgusting I swear the meat was raw. The iced tea tasted like poor tap water. The fried rice was bland and the chicken in it tasted/felt just about raw or barley cooked. The chicken noodles where pretty much all grease I couldn't even taste the chicken which again was barley cooked and tasted funky.   I ordered the same thing both times to ensure it wasn't a fluke and I LOVE Chinese and Asian cuisine in general (yes I know the noodles and wonton is very common but it was highly recommend to me so I had to try it) and this place gives me the shivers when I think about it.   I love the venetian hotel (stayed there 3 times) and I am baffled as to why the allow this sub-par (to say the least) restaurant to continue wasting space there.",

The Venetian/Palazzo is great for fine dining, but it doesn't have a lot of mid range dining options.  Noodle Asia is great for filling your stomach and satisfying your culinary cravings without breaking the bank.  It has a very typical \"in casino\" atmosphere, just feet from the extended poker room.  You are always reminded of the fact that you are dining in a casino.  The food is good, albeit overpriced.  We paid $8.50 for a dim sum dish that would normally be $4.00.  Whatever.  You're in Vegas and you're on the strip and it's 11pm.  I really like Noodle Asia, but in reality, I only eat there if I'm about to hit the Venetian poker room.  The food is good, but overpriced.  The location is great, but you are sure to hit a mixture of bachelorette parties and locals trying to get a decent bit to eat.",

Sure, the food is pricey, but is worth it if you are away from home and seriously craving Chinese food.  Actually, this place is better than some of the Chinese restaurants in the SF Bay Area.  My Mom gave the owner a thumbs up which says a lot as she owned a Chinese restaurant with Dad for almost 20 years.  Minced beef with egg rice was on hit Shanghai rice cakes were almost as good as Mom's Singapore Mei Fen (name on menu but most of us probably know it as Singapore Chow Mi Fun) was equally delicious  Will definitely come here again the next time I'm in Vegas",

They ended charging us $20 for the dish and the average price of all their rice and noodles dishes is $15 so we thought that was very suspicious. I didn't think to look at the menu prices on Yelp at the time but I just looked and the minced beef rice was $12.50. Menu prices have probably changed a little by then...but not $20. RIDICULOUS!!!!!   Moving along.. We got our check and paid. They never gave us our change. It was so hard to get their attention because they kept avoiding our table and looking away. Finally we flagged someone down and asked for our change. They assumed the change was tip. Ok a restaurant should never assume the change is tip. You can't just keep a customer's change without asking. And we didn't even leave enough for it to be considered tip.... Anyway we were very upset because the service was just really bad. We got our change and left a tip that we felt reflected the service. As we were walking out, the waiter ran to us and told us that they don't need our change and handed us back the tip. I think this speaks for itself.....",

I would give it 5 stars but the prices were a little high for the food we were getting.

    "text": "For a place I expected to be comparable to fast-food style Chinese food, I was impressed. Located in the Venetian casino, my dad and I passed by and decided on a whim to give it a try. We tried the stir-fried noodles with chicken, and the BBQ pork and duck rice dish (this seemed to be one of their most popular dishes - several of the tables around us also ordered this dish).   The great thing about Noodle Asia is the good selection of dishes, they bring your food out quickly, and the food just reminded me of a good home-cooked meal. I'm not claiming that the food is super authentic Chinese food, but it's definitely a few steps above Panda Express or any other fast-food Chinese establishment. The food was hot and fresh, it tasted good, and you were given a lot of food. What else could you ask for?  The dishes ranged from rice dishes, a couple of dim sum options, moo shu, rice porridge, to noodle soups, wok-tossed noodles, and soups. With two, you should order at least two dishes, with each dish around $12-16. I wouldn't say the atmosphere is the best, because you're basically sitting in an open-area restaurant in the middle of the casino, but it suits the fast-casual experience.   We came relatively early for dinner, around 6 pm, but as we left, a line was starting to form to get seated. Definitely plan on coming early, because I don't know if the food is necessarily worth a long wait.",

I'm pretty sure the cooks in back are flown in from China (or Taiwan?) and don't speak a lick of English.  The best thing on the menu though has to be the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup.  Totally LEGIT.  The beef is super tender, the soup is spicy and flavorful and the noodles taste like they were made fresh that day.  My friends tell me that it's the best beef noodle soup they've had outside of Asia and I'm inclined to believe them.  It's certainly better than anything I've had in California.  Noodle Asia is already open until 2am, but I wish they were open even later for post-clubbing drunken dining.  But I guess the chefs need to sleep sometime...",

In retrospect, maybe ordering Pho at a Chinese restaurant isn't the smartest thing because it tasted exactly like what you might expect - a Chinese take on a Vietnamese dish. Thin broth, definitely not prepared for hours with the love one must put into creating a deep flavored beef broth. And the spices were off - maybe a little too much on the Chinese five spice. In all fairness, I will have to go back and actually try the Chinese food to truly give this a proper rating.",

I ended up coming here for dinner after a long day of endless long islands and scotch, just needed some hot noodle soup to wash it down my system.  Anywho. I shared the Crab Rangoon with my friends and ordered the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Crab Rangoon was good. It's very crisp and not burnt, quite filling for the creamy cheesy texture. $14 for a bowl of noodle that normally sells for half the price. Luckily, the portions are bigger than what it normally is. Ingredients wasn't anything too spectacular, just the usual shrimp and veggies. I ended up eating only half of the portion.  Food isn't extremely great, it's better presentation than regular Chinese food places. Taste is there, pretty standard. But my dish wasn't spicy at all, which was  a disappointment in that sense. When I see \"Spicy\" and a chili pepper symbol next to the menu item, I want some kick in it.   They do charge for tea. Don't be expecting tea to be free just because it's an Asian place. $3 for a pot of flavorless Jasmine Green Tea. My opinion is that I can get better tea for $1. I might as well be Asian and order hot water.",

But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside.   Once at the counter, we ordered, two noodle soup dishes.  it was pretty uneventful and unflavorful.  Maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it was because they were so busy that they were rushing and not preparing food properly.    We ate here because we watched Rock of Ages at the Venetian.   I don't think I would ever come back here again.  For noodles - I much prefer Noodles at Bellagio!",

We ordered the Beef Rice Noodles and after the first bite, it was obvious it had been cooked in old recycled oil and possibly in a wok with burnt residue.  The old dirty oil taste was so overwhelming, it took over the entire dish and we couldn't taste the dish itself.  We had two bites and left to eat elsewhere.",

With regards to Noodle Asia - Maybe I'm jaded by living in SF where you get great dim sum (Hung Tu Seafood restaurant is my favorite dim sum joint in the bay area if anyone cares) and chinese food in general. This place was nothing to write home about. Standard fare that you can get in any run down Chinese take out place in the U.S.   Don't think i need to waste my time on this place anymore.",

Other bowls like the Wonton Noodle Soup and Curry Beef Brisket Noodle Soup were decent.  Across the board, be ready for the Vegas premium that cranks up the cost of everything by $3-5.  Service was fine though be aware that rice dishes can take much longer than the noodle soups (eg. my friend got his plate after everyone else had finished).  That or they just screwed up and forgot the original order.",

There's plenty to try whether vegetarian or omnivore. Come check it out this spot for some quick eats.",

Yes, it is more expensive than Spring Mountain Road, and yes, as you may have guessed, the menu is noodle-heavy, but there are some solid dishes for snacking. Just ask for what you like without being beholden to the menu options.   We went in looking for a good garlic stir-fried vegetable without sauce and a spicy, soft noodle. We asked the waitress for just that, and we ended up with a well-executed bok choy and a spicy black bean noodle that wasn't exactly on the menu. The noodle was technically Si Jiu Beef, but it is traditionally a crispy noodle, and we wanted chicken. Our waitress was able to modify the order no problem, so special orders don't upset them!   I thought both dishes were delicious, especially because they came to the table piping hot. It was a late night, need to sober up snack for us, not dinner, and it hit the spot just right.",

The thing to get here is the Szechuan beef noodle soup.  For some unknown stupid reason I decided to try something different and get the Spicy Ying Nan noodles (since the waiter recommended it and I knew I could steal a taste of the beef noodles from my husband's bowl).  The broth for the spicy noodles was tasty, but I much prefer the noodles in the beef noodle soup.  We also had an order of the shrimp shumai which was also excellent.  Definitely a must-try in Vegas!  Dress casually; it's a casual dining restaurant in the Venetian (over by the sports betting).",

We were a group of four people and we were seated right away on a late Saturday night....  The Service was excellent because I usually measure it by the fact all of our drink glasses were always full.  The attentiveness of staff was 5 Yelp Stars through and through.  I guess we got them on a good night, after reading other Yelp reviews of their service.  The Food was also excellent. Our group ordered 3 appetizers consisting of shoi mai, pot stickers, and wonton yumminess. (Sorry...I don't remember the name of the wonton dish) I ordered my favorite dish of minced beef with egg on rice and everyone else ordered some 3 different noodle soups which they told me was very good for their Americanized tastes.  The Price was OMG - HIGH - $25 per person, not including tip!!  When I eat at any Asian food place, I am really driven by price. I guess it is because I know I can get good Asian food without breaking your wallet.  But I knew about the pricing before I went into the restaurant.  It was really out of sheer convenience of not wanting to leave the hotel for something to eat.  it really was the BEST place for us to eat at the Venetian Hotel & Casino.  Five Yelp Stars for the Food and Service. One Yelp Star for the price.  I will give the Noodle Asia Restaurant an average of Three Yelp Stars for my visit.",

    "text": "I suppose Noodle Asia fist the mold of the late night \"fill-me-up\" food, which people seek after a night of drinking in Las Vegas.  Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.    There was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.    Though the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the \"casual\" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there.",

Authentic chinese/asian food with an extensive menu, including pan fried noodle. soup noodle, typical rice dishes and even porridge. Price is very reasonable considering the quality, portions and location (Vegas).  Food is well done with fresh veggies and marinated meat, not salty or greasy (which is the problem with most chinese joints in my opinion).   Service is quick meaning if there are folks waiting for seats, your check will come rather quickly after you finish eating and before you even walked away from the table, waiter is already cleaning the table for the next customers.   For the price point, I have no complaint.",

The only time they said their \"please\" and \"thank you\" was when the lady dropped off the check.

But now that I think about it, I had pan friend chow mein something or another and perhaps  more noodles prepared one way or another. Can't go wrong with noodles. I am pretty sure I ordered lack luster sio mai as well. All in all it wasn't bad since I'm sure that it probably tasted 5x as good as it was greasy.

    "text": "Noodle Asia is inside the Venetian Hotel, in the corner of the Casino near the Sports Book.   It should be called Noodle China. 95% of the dishes are some variety of Chinese food, be it Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Cantonese.   Sure, they throw in a couple of Japanese things, like Edamame appetizer, and something that is wok fried udon? (More typically, this would be yakisoba, or fried soba noodles). And they do have at least 1 Korean dish, Kimchee! I didn't see any Viet noodles, Thai noodles, Korean noodles, Singaporean noodles, or more Japanese noodles, etc.   The atmosphere is casual, with an open view of the large woks in the kitchen, with the water flowing over the cooking area to remove all the grease and tidbits spilled in the stir-fry cooking process, just like a Chinatown kitchen.   The food isn't bad actually. The green veggie of the day was a choice of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) or Baby Bok Choy. I went for the Bok Choy. NIce small baby stems.   I also ordered a bowl of Nau Nam Mein Curry Soup, or Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle Soup, It hit the spot and warmed me up, as I was chilled by the overactive air-conditioning in the Venetian. I don't know how those cocktail waitresses in the skimpy, short , sleeveless, bar wench dresses can stand the chill. Their dual weather barometers definitely would perk up in the nippyness.  Mine did!  I also ordered an oolong tea, which came in a cast iron Japanese style tea pot.   The service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses.   So Oolong tea, baby bok choy, and Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle soup. Sounds like about $10 in your typical Chinatown, right?  This is Vegas baby, try and guess again. Go higher, way higher!   How about $30!? For one person?!? WTF!   If you are a cheap Chinese person raised in Chinatown or FOB, or if you are less than fourth generation ABC, don't go here! You will feel ripped off!  This is not Hon's Won Ton on Kearney in SF for sure!   Tea: $3.50 Stir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00 Curry Beef Noodle Soup: $12.95 Tax: $2.30 Total $30.75!  You are better off driving down Spring Mountain just outside of the Venetian, due west to about Valley View, and go to Las Vegas' Chinatown. (Actually, unlike Noodle Asia, you can get Viet, Korean, Thai, and most of the other noodles of Asia from there.)",

And although portions are big, you still feel like you want more after your first helping.

This place serves up noodles soup, fried rice, stir fried noodles, congee and dim sum.   We sat at the counter and loved it. We had attentive service and got to watch the two old Chinese chefs wok it up. We shared the following dishes:   -Won ton soup  -Har gow (Steamed, crescent-shaped mini shrimp dumplings)  -Red won tons (Tossed in Szechwan Hung Yao chili, garlic sauce)  -Buddha's feast pan-toasted noodles   The food was very authentic and made for Chinese folks. It's not a 5 star Chinese joint but it's not  that Panda Express junk made for the every day gringo. It's your typical late night Chinese cafe. Get in, get out.   This place hits the spot when you've had one too many cocktails. They are open until 3 am and the best part is, there are Chinese men cooking your food! What more could you ask for?",

I put maybe 5-6 spoonfuls of chili paste in my bowl to add some flavor. On top of that, it was overpriced at $13.95 a bowl.  I've lived in the San Francisco bay area all my life where there are a million Asian restaurants that serve noodle soup. So, that's why I give this place a 2....\"Meh.

Way to make us feel welcome and valued as paying customers.   So we ordered the Beef Stew Noodle and the Spicy Yunnan Rice Noodle Soup. Wasn't expecting much, how authentic could it be on the strip? But, I was pleasantly surprised!   Spicy Yunnan: The noodles were a good consistency, the shrimp was plump, and the broth was hot and delicious.   Beef Noodle: The noodles were a bit too doughy and the broth was bland but the beef was really tender.   If you are stuck on the strip, come here. But if you have a car, get out of the hotel and drive 5 minutes to Chinatown where you can find better food at better prices. We ended up paying ~$30 for two entrees. I could buy 3-5 better tasting noodle plates elsewhere! Good food, but the prices and the impatient service won't be bringing me back.",

We were under the impression that they were under construction, lucky us it was open!   A long line outside of what seemed like a tourist bus full of chinese business men. We waited for about 20mins. Finally seated. I ordered the Tainan noodles. It came to the table in a timely matter.   Noodles were a bit too al dente for me and then broth tasted like chicken top ramen from the bag. It was pretty much a wanna be bowl of Shoyu ramen.   We waited about 30 minutes to pay but no one in sight was checking on us. Outside there were about 25 people waiting for a table and inside there were about 7 empty tables. The servers were a bit rude. Finally under a time crunch I walked up and behind the counter to hand them my debit card and check. There wasn't even an appology of any sort.  Meh...they are only \"good\" because they are the only more \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant on the strip.   Someone needs to open up a real ramen house or Pho noodle house to take them down ;)",

Stir fry soft noodles w/chicken- Looked like too much food for 1 person, but surprisingly I devoured the entire thing.   BBQ pork and duck noodle soup-  YUM!  The broth definitely hit the spot for breakfast.  Really tasty solid pieces of pork and duck.    Service is still typical Asian service.  Opens at 11am.",

Unfortunately, that's all the good stuff I have to say about this place.  The bad: I noticed most servers in here are asian, and I hate being stereotypical, but my expectations of a bad service were correct. Yes, our server brought our drinks and food quickly, but I felt really rushed since she came twice to take our order after bringing our drinks, so I had to order what my friend recommended, soft noodles with chicken, pork and sea food.  The Ugly: The noodles were terrible. But maybe that's just my opinion since my friend did liked them. They are really greasy. I agree with the previous review saying that they might cook with msg. I could not finish my food so I had to take it to my room which is probably gonna end up in the trash anyways.",

They were out of flat rice noodle, therefore the server recommended the si jiu beef noodles.  The beef and sauce are poured over a bed of crispy thin egg noodles.  This is generally a good dish, and this one was not bad at all.  The beef was very tender, and I liked the noodles once they absorb the sauce.  The combination fried rice was just OK.  It tasted fine, yet something was very plain about it.  I had to add hot sauce so it wouldn't be so boring.  Instead of having slices of meat, some of the meat was shaped in little rectangles, making it seem very cheap.  Sooooo considering that you are in a casino in Vegas, not a bad choice for asian food.  For my own preference, I would rather go elsewhere.  PS: Depending on where you are sitting, you can also watch sports on the TVs right outside the restaurant.",

Only a few vegetables; bean sprouts, pickled cabbage and a few rehydrated mushrooms. Pork was in tiny tidbits, it looked like chicken, but apparently it was pork. Little to no flavor. Added soy sauce and chili paste for taste. Boyfriend had the Szechuan beef noodle soup which was extremely too hot. Beef was tasty, but broth had too much chili oil. Mixed some of my soup with his to cool his down and spice mine up! Overall it was fine. Maybe the other entrees are tastier?",

    "text": "I was really craving Chinese food after a long weekend in Vegas filled with drinking, gambling, and general debauchery. In comes Noodle Asia.   What I ended up experiencing was a) poor service (even though the restaurant was half full) b) bland food c) high prices   Our server forgot our waters for about 15 minutes, brought all our meals out at separate times, and took 20 minutes to pick up our check after she brought it to the tabe. Talk about mind being elsewhere. Actually, let me reprase: Our server never came back to get our check, we had to flag the manager down after 20 minutes of waiting.   In terms of food... bleh. I had the broccoli and beef with spring rolls on the side. I can safely say I've had $5.99 Chinese takeout meals that have been way better. The food really had no flavor to it, and I had to douse it with duck sauce and other spices to coax any sort of taste out of the dish.    Maybe it's my strictly American palette, but I think I've become accustomed to Americanized Asian food and get really thrown off when authentic Asian food is put in front of me. Who knows?   What I do know is that I wouldn't be back, and would recommend all Vegas-goers to skip over Noodle Asia in favor of the food court nearby.",

The lines can be long but they move fast. The staff and cooks are also Asian so they move fast but don't expect a bunch of wasted chit chat. Just order your noodles and chow down.   The infamous szechaun beef noodle soup is really on point. Deep, rich and with a slight heat, the beef has got tendon and all. Soft. The noodles are tender, perhaps slightly overdone. But the flavors are thoroughly satisfying. The char sui (BBQ pork) is a bit fatty and they swipe on a different sauce than usual. The dan dan noodles are more peanut and less spicy than most. Just add hit sauce.   Overall, being smack dab in the Venetian on the strip, the prices are slightly more but given the absolute dearth of reasonably good and not outrageously priced Chinese food, this is your best option to satisfy that craving.",

There was a short wait (Saturday 7pm) but we got a good seat at the bar. The staff was very attentive although super busy running around. Everything on the menu looked good but we were just looking to snack. We ordered the beef noodle soup (which was actually spicy AND delicious) and the red won tons (which was just okay - too much sauce). Since we didn't order a full meal, the check didn't seem that expensive, but I know it's definitely overpriced. Not sure if I'd come back again, but overall it was a fine experience.

I had to go find a waitress a total of three times before the hostess decided to just come and take our order herself. Our food came out about fifteen minutes later and our drinks finally came out an additional 10 after that (sadly I actually kept track). No one ever came to refill any of our drinks. The only thing that made me feel a little better is that I wasn't the only one who  was receiving this type of service. Three other tables also had to either get up and find someone to take their orders or find someone to print out their checks because they weren't being attended to. Maybe this was just a bad night for Noodle Asia but as far as I'm concerned with horrible service and mediocre food I don't think I will ever return.   Nooooo Thanks.

It had a nice complexity of flavors and some nice heat to it. The portion was more than enough for me.  The decor definitely leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't give a shit as long as it tastes great. And the prices were decent (by Vegas standards at least).  If people are complaining about spending $11 for a meal in Vegas, I don't know where the fuck they are eating the rest of the time they are there.  I went to a very expensive steakhouse the night before and spent over $100 for a meal I enjoyed less than the one I had at Noodle Asia. And what's the deal with everyone pointing out that they taste MSG? Somehow I doubt that most people can even pick out the flavor of MSG on their pallet. And even if it does have it, I don't come to Vegas to eat healthy. It the city of sin god damn it! I eat what tastes good and this tasted fuckin great when I had it. Hopefully that hasn't changed. I'll find out next time I go back to Vegas.",

I was naive to think that because it was in The Venetian, the quality would be great, but I really felt like I was in a hole in the wall with slow service.  My boyfriend and I shared a two dishes and a soup.  The soup was Egg Flower Soup and I have never seen this soup with tomatoes in it.  The flavor was disappointing, very bland.  We also shared the Chinese Broccoli.  This was the winner.  Not a huge portion for $10.00, but it was good.  It was still crunchy and the sauce did not over take it.  The minced beef over rice and fried egg, do not order it.  The prices are pretty high with Orange Chicken at $18.00.   My friend who ordered it didn't even finish it because it tasted like \"cardboard\"",

I personally thought the food wasn't going to be so great, but boy was I proven wrong, it was pretty authentic Chinese food and it was goooood!  I, being the fobby half asian that I am, ordered the minced beef over rice with one egg, and my friends split the chicken fried rice.  Both were very tasty and not super greasy.  Yes, the food here was a bit on the pricey side for Chinese, but since it was located in the Venetian, what do you honestly expect?  Either way, if I was drunk and hungry in the middle of the night while at the Venetian, I'd definitely come back!",

I like the beef Szechwan noodles and rice dish.  Its a good place to eat at when your looking for a quick bite to eat, especially since it's located right next to the the rooms.

It's probably from all the tired partying and want some comfort food.    We ordered a lot of food, spicy beef stew noodle soup, porridge, Singapore rice noodles, beef chow fun, and chow mein.

Wait time for your food is crazy  then they bring you food you didnt order, so u wait, only to tell you that your food was probably laid on someone else's table so u wait some more. Food came, you asked for a bowl and took another century to come and had to physically tackle the server on the other table. You wait some more and the bowl was probably still in the factory. Worst part, Nobody even apologized. Another incidence, ordered food and never came in so you cancelled it coz the appetite just went away, check came in and they still charged you for it and they even fight you and say they delivered it.. OMG. I guess have your food to go? Wheres the management here?",

They have the best porridge\", says my mother.  Coming from my mother who doesn't like rice porridge, I'll have to take her word for it.  So I made a plan to take a trip down to LV.  So last December, my husband and I drove all the way down to LV in my beat-up car.  We stayed for 3 nights and aside from several Vacation Ownerships we attended to get free shows and dinner, we also made a point to visit some of the newer casinos and attempt my luck at the casinos.  Noodle Asia came highly recommended and a MUST try per my mother's standard.    I had to search for the place since she really didn't remember the name except its the Chinese restaurant in The Venetian.  Being that this is the only one we saw that seems to serve porridge we tried it.  The place looked as messy and beat  up as my car but the hordes of people lining up and eating in this tiny place seems like a good sign.  We got a table after a few minutes.  We couldn't decide what to get so my husband ordered their fried rice and I got their porridge with beef and century egg.  The porridge was really good.  It seems bland at the beginning, probably because I was expecting it to totally blow me away but it grew on me until I couldn't resist not finishing the entire bowl.    It was made simple but it reminded me of the time my Dad used to take me to Chinatown for a bowl of porridge.  It was delicious.  The service is like any other Chinese restaurant... always in a rush and hard to get them to notice you.  But after a few tries, we were able to get someone to put more water in our glass and finally get us our check.  I'll definitely go back just for the porridge alone but its not a place I'd keep craving for.",

The first issue I have is that it has the feel of a greasy casino kitchen mainly because it's located inside the sportsbook at the Venetian.   Another big issue I have is that I couldn't really decipher what half of the menu contained. Some of the menu items had a description while others just listed their name. Now if I knew what they were this would be no issue but sadly I couldn't really figure out what to order and just ended up picking some random noodle dish with beef. I probably ordered cat, I honestly have no fucking clue!  The dish itself was delicious and I felt like I ate a portion that was easily made for 3-4 people. OOPS! It was a bit spicy but not to the point of crying, although there is nothing wrong with a few tears while dining. My friend swears by their shrimp fried rice so I tried some and wasn't blow away at all. If I closed my eyes I could have sworn I was in a panda express that added shrimp. Maybe next time I will dine with someone who can interpret the menu and guide me through the jungle that is Noodle Asia.",

    "text": "Booooo, not satisfied at all by this place!  Had come here with an open mind and left disgruntled and frustrated.  First off, the waitress was very sassy and aggressive in tone. Had asked her about some of the items on the menu and she answered in a tone that suggested that I should already know!!! I do not work here so it would be very nice of you, as the waitress, to help me understand. Additionally, my lady had asked about getting some steamed rice and this waitress acted liked she had asked for her soul! IS IT REALLY A BIG DEAL TO ASK FOR A 2 SIDES OF RICE!!! REALLY!!! This waitress clearly needed some time off of work or something because she was dropping the ball for her team and this business!!!  Secondly, the eating utensils were not clean at all! Ewww, do you really expect me to use these dirty utensils to eat my food with! I am not a fan of bacteria and to think that it was appropriate to put these out on the table is just foolish! Luckily, I know how to use chopsticks but this is just not okay at all. I felt bad for the all the other customers that did not inspect there silverware!   The food was alright! I was just more let down but to fact that I had such an awful waitress.   Side note, I had some family friends come out to Vegas while I was there and they also ate at this same restaurant and had the same sentiments. They had bad customer service as well and had issues with their order as well.   I would like to give this place another chance but this disaster that took place while I was here needs to be addressed at some point.   #sadnoodles #paythepriceforsteamedrice",

    "text": "If you don't mind the unreasonably high price for simple Chinese food and are craving some decent Chinese dishes, Noodle Asia is perfect.   My parents need their daily dose of Chinese food, so while we were in Vegas for a week, we ended up coming here EVERY DAY...   We stayed at the Palazzo so the main reason was convenience. Other top reasons we kept coming back:  1. Super fast service  2. Large menu of mediocre dishes   I was actually pleasantly surprised that their beef stir fried flat noodles () had a good wok-flavor to them. A little on the oily side, but still a tasty dish.  Other dishes we got:  Sesame noodles (Dan Dan noodles ) were absurdly mushy. For some reason, it came with the noodles already chopped up... As if they were expecting a toddler to be eating it. It was nutty and had little bits of minced pork throughout it... But seriously lacked any recognizable texture and appearance...   Wonton noodles soup - pretty standard. I'd be really impressed if they messed this up.   BBQ meat over rice and the beef noodle soup  - both were mediocre. Don't expect to be wowed.  Portion sizes are satisfying and definitely shareable/family-style.  On average, we ordered about 3 entrees each time and it came out to be about $50. Def double the price than it ought to be.",

The shrimp fried noodles were pretty good.  Really liked the spring rolls.  It's basically a sit down fast food place though so expect to get shuffled in and out as fast as possible.

    "text": "Food (3/5) When in Las Vegas and you don't feel like spending a ton of money on buffets, you can always fall back on Noodle Asia. Tucked in the back of the Venetian next to the sports betting area, you can certainly grab some cheaper fare, but it's still a bit pricey overall.  I had a bowl of the spicy beef noodle soup (~$15-$16), but it was only a-okay. Beef was all the tendon pieces, so there was actually very little pieces of \"meat.\" The broth was also incredibly oily, so I wouldn't recommend this dish if you have an overly sensitive stomach. The noodles themselves were great though - I thought they were a good chewy consistency, but they were drowned out by the \"average-ness\" of the broth and the sub-par beef cuts.  Service (3/5) Nothing crazy here. It's traditional wait staff, but they're SUPER attentive in filling up your water, so that was nice.  Atmosphere (4/5) Noodle Asia goes ALL OUT on the \"Chinese\" decor. Red color abounds the dining area, and ginormous versions of traditional Chinese charms adorn the walls.  What's super cool about Noodle Asia is the floor-to-ceiling glass windows so you can have a great view to the sports betting area (aka: the jumbo-sized screens showing all the latest sports games). It's almost like getting front-row seats to the betting area but without spending the $$$ to get a spot.  Overall, Noodle Asia is only okay. It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst. It's a much needed reprieve from Vegas's $50 buffets in terms of dollar savings and not over-indulging in gluttony. Honestly though, I'm not sure if I'd come back since there are way too many delicious food options on The Strip but it's definitely a convenient restaurant option if you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo.",

However, there were definitely certain areas this place excelled at, while others fizzled.  We came one day because one in our party was hungover. We needed jook. This is something they absolutely excel in. The jook is creamy and insanely perfect. Portions are huge too so you might want to share that.  The Cantonese items are all fantastic including \"gon chow ngau hor\" the beef chow fun, or the soups like the ginger chicken double boiled soup, also fabulous.  But move towards the more northern Chinese selections and things start going south. For instance, the noodles soup with preserved mustard greens and pork -- below average! The noodles were so doughy it made the broth muddy and not clear.  The ma po tofu was dismal -- no flavor and the chile used was incorrect.  One of our friends ordered the moo shu vegetables which she said was delicious -- it looked good, but I didn't try it.  So stick with the Cantonese offerings and stay away from the rest. Service was okay on all of our visits.",

It was a nice, big bowl of soup that really hit the spot. There were seven large, tasty dumplings, the broth was warming and the noodles had a nice al dente bite to them that made the dish very filling.  Knocked off a star because it's on the pricier end for Chinese food. It's to be expected because of the location but still, $16 (including tip) for a bowl of noodle soup is a little up there.",

The food overall was really good and tasty. The price was on the more expensive side but it is in a casino. The Shu Mai was really tasty and they were decently sized. I would recommend it. The bbq pork and roast duck rice was good except for the duck. We unfortunately got bad pieces. It was all bone and part of the neck. How is that acceptable right??  The pork was spot on though, so maybe get just bbq pork only? The beef noodle soup was really good and not crazy spicy. Definitely would hit the spot for late night eats!",

I only came here out of a craving and was incredibly disappointed about everything.  The prices here are SO overpriced. I guess that's what you get for eating at a casino but it was ridiculous. The \"combination stir fried noodles\" were $16.95!! It just seemed like they threw together some noodles and soy sauce. 6 pieces of shu mai was a whopping $9.95! The service was slow and didn't pay us any attention.   All of the food was very cheap and seemed like they just threw it together or heated it up right there. Definitely not worth the price. There's much better Chinese food out there. Trust me.",

    "text": "This is my all-time favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas to get my Singapore noodle craving fulfilled. Being a Vegas resident, I rather not make the trek across town just to eat at restaurants in the casinos, but I will make an exception for Noodle Asia when the craving gets real.  They are located inside of the Venetian on the Strip. It is tucked away in the corner, right next to their Race & Sports Book. The Venetian hosts a variety of conventions throughout the year so beware of looooong lines and wait times when there's a convention in town.   Their Singapore noodles (listed as Singapore Mei Fan on their menu) is very possibly the best I have ever had in any restaurant in North America. I love the atmosphere, being right next to the sports bar during football season and the service, while not seemingly friendly at times, is fast and efficient.  Some people complain about the prices. Yes, it's obviously going to be pricier than your typical Chinatown meal deal, but come on-- what do you expect from a restaurant on the Strip?",

My friends and I came here after a clubbing night though so the food was much needed, even if the service was slow.  We ordered the beef chow fun noodles and the duck noodle soup (they ran out of pork so we just had duck noodle). The beef noodles were actually pretty good tasting, though a bit expensive at around $15 for it, but it wasn't like we cared much at this hour.  The duck noodle soup wasn't too bad either. It was pretty standard though, and there was not all that much special about it, but I guess it hit the spot and took care of what it needed to.  Overall if I was staying at the Venetian and desperate for Asian food I'd probably come here out of sheer laziness, but it wouldn't be a place I'd make my way out of to go to.",

I wouldn't go with the crispy noodles, I'd go with the soft ones, but the crispy ones are really great for some texture.   The soup is more cost effective if you get a big bowl, so I'd recommend doing that.  One cup isn't enough anyway, that's also perfect to wash down whatever else you get.  They do have bottles of wine which is nice, but there are some killer cocktails as well.  Service was kind and attentive, and everything came out quickly despite it being packed.   It's less expensive than other options in the Venetian, but doesn't skimp on quality.  Definitely a good choice",

This restaurant is located in Venetian.  They are very busy during brunch-Lunch time.  Good service but to busy to call a server.  Pro: Fast preparing the food. Closes at 3AM! Con: to busy to ask for a fork. Advice: Order everything at once, because you won't see your server until your done with your food.  Food Pro: Their Shrimp Dim Sum was amazing. Also recommend Pork & Duck with rice. Con: I cant say this is bad but by demand we ordered their Beef Noodles soup. I really didn't think it was amazing nor tasty. It was actually very salty. It might have been just that day but I didn't think it was great compare to what other Yelpers inputted. also we tired their Milk Bubble tea..... ill say 5/10. We got it as soon as we ordered it, had barely ice in it and wasn't cold.  Overall: Not what I expected it to be but they had some good dish. Their Dim sum is a must for sure.!",

    "text": "Casual dining restaurants on the Strip are typically: overpriced 20%+, serve decent food and the service is hit or miss...Noodle Asia meets the Strip's A-ok criteria in my book  Noodle Asia Service: When the capacity is about 75% full or less, the service has been consistently good.  Servers will follow up with your drinks and the kitchen will get you your food in a decent time.  Above 75% and you might run into issues as it doesn't appear that they are staffed appropriately.  Also, when a line forms outside the entrance you might want to go somewhere else if you don't want to sit at the counter  Noodle Asia Cuisine:  I've only ordered the noodle soups as I always seem to be on a time constraint when I dine here.  With that, the Szechwan beef is my current favorite.  It's Szechwan spicy were it doesn't burn them mouth but I'll start sweating as I dine. The classic Hong Kong Won Ton soup works if you're not into spicy.  The broth has good and better days but the volume of noodles and beef has always been plentiful  You can find noodle houses up Spring Mountain that offer better quality cuisine for cheaper.  However, if you're confined to the strip Noodle Asia is your best/only option which isn't a bad thing.  Keep your expectations with Noodle Asia (and life in general) realistic, and all can be well.  The location keeps me returning.  Enjoy...! =)",

    "text": "Very good Asian food without breaking the bank... Well, not too much anyway...  On our last night we were looking for something a little simpler than the fancy restaurants that dwell within the depths of every strip casino resort but didn't want to wallow in a buffet or fast food. Noodle Asia was a good choice.  The only problem is finding the place to begin with... Which seems to be a bit of a theme in Vegas... You typically can't get to anything without passing a phalanx of slot machines (sometimes twice if you get turned around.) I'll make this so much easier than it was for us as we went through pretty much all of the Venetian. There is a bridge over Las Vegas Blvd from the Mirage / Treasure Island side that goes directly into the Venetian. Go down the escalator, straight through the sliding glass doors and there it is, right next to the sports book. Bright red. You can't miss it. The worst is over!  The restaurant is open on to the casino so great for people watching... And a decent view of the sports book TV's if you are so inclined (can't hear them though which is a  good thing.) Nicely decorated in a minimalist way that keeps it several steps above the buffets and quick bite places without the glitz if the much more expensive restaurants.  Service was efficient and polite. Not a real stand out but nothing at all to complain about.  The food was above average but not quite as good as my favorite local places back home (better than PF Chang's for a more universal reference.) I started with the lettuce wraps... Delicious! Large cups of lettuce leaf that were very easy to fill and a fantastic brown sauce. I loved them. My entree was Mongolian beef... Very good but didn't blow me away. I would try something else next time. They do bring a little pot of Asian chili sauce  to the table which definitely improved my beef... But beware... It is spicy... And not the wussy kind of spicy that old ladies complain about when the get fast food Mexican... Clear up your allergies spicy. Yum!  Prices were decent for a casino resort restaurant... $15 - 27 for most entrees. Appetizers were a little pricy but definitely worth it.  This place won't be the culinary highlight of your trip but it is a nice place for a relaxed dinner, reasonable prices and good food.",

    "text": "This is a 3.5 star review, but not quite 4.  I had dinner at Noodle Asia on a Friday night around 10:30.  It was busy, but there were a few open tables.  I know from previous experience there can be quite a line for this place, but they usually get through it decently quick.  Our server immediately arrived to take our drink order.  They have the usual suspects for Asian beers as well as a small wine and cocktail list.  I went with Asahi and the server was fairly quick with the refills.  To start we went with the seared shrimp chive dumplings and Har Gow, which are steamed shrimp dumplings.  The appetizers came out fairly quickly, definitely under 10 minutes.  The Har Gow was good but the winner in my estimation was the shrimp chive dumplings.  They have a nice crispy exterior and really strong chive flavor.  If you do not like chives do not order this dish, as it is definitely chive-forward.  I love chives and not surprisingly I loved this dish.  For my entree I had the Pho Special Prime which includes rare ribeye, brisket, tripe, and meatballs.  The broth was good but it lacked the depth of flavor I have had at many pho places.  The brisket and ribeye were good, the trip was not as good but certainly not bad, but the meatballs were a miss for me.  The texture was very hard as if they had been overworked.  I would get the pho again but I would request extra brisket instead of meatballs.  I did have to pull a couple of pieces of meat out of the soup in order to cut them on a plate.  They were too large to eat in one bite.  I would order the dumplings again for sure and would try the pho, provided I can get the meatballs substituted.  This is a more than solid joint if you are at the poker room or sportsbook and need a quick bite.  I will likely return.",

    "text": "Noodle Asia is located in the Venetian Hotel inside the Casino area. All signs point to a very good experience. Traditional and limited menu items, large crowd of Asians, and no frills decor.   I pick this place mainly because I wanted some soup to warm up my soul. So I got an order of shrimp Har Gow and a bowl of Hong Kong Wonton Soup. It was very reasonable for a Vegas Strip markup at less than 20 for the full meal.   The cons: service was spotty and took at least 10+ mins before a waitress even asked me what I wanted to drink. Then my main dish came out before my appetizer. This caused a weird start because I started to finish my soup half way, but then my Har Gow came and I stopped eating my soup to eat those too to avoid it getting cold. So timing is clearly of no importance, but it looks like that's the case with all the patrons that all the food comes out at once.   On the other hand, the soup was great and the Har Gow was flavorful and fresh. I can admire the quality of the broth and it tasted better than instant like some reviewers were saying.   Overall, did it change my life? Nah...but it's not a bad place to go for some simple and decently priced Chinese food in the strip!",

First off, the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup here is fantastic.  Great and relatively fantastic.  If you are craving authentic Chinese Beef Noodle Soup, it won't get better than this in Vegas.    The Singaporean pan fried noodles were also great.  Well spiced and flavored, and like the noodles in the Beef Noodle Soup, well cooked and perfectly al dente.    Highly recommended place, especially for you Cantonese and Taiwanese tastes.  The style of cooking here will accommodate both types of tongue.    Oh, and they are open until late.

For instance the Shanghai noodles I ordered had a piddly amount of shredded pork in it but plenty of noodles.

The sauce was great but the noodles was a tad bit overcooked. Nonetheless, a decently priced meal for the location.   Efficient service, considering the restaurant was packed. I think they cannot afford not to be as volume is key to their survival. If you don't want fast-food and want to spare your pockets a pinch... this would be a perfect choice for a fussy-free meal.",

Even the hot sauce in the white container on the table is good, and I see many Venetian guests order takeout and probably bring it back to their rooms to eat.  That's how good the food is here.  Service is alright so there's really nothing to complain about here.  For Vegas, this place is definitely 5 stars.

However, it was a bit oily for my liking, but I was way too hungry, so I finished this whole plate! Lol! 2. Seafood mix udon-This was not a good dish at all...The seafood didn't taste that fresh. The flavor was bland and not very satisfying.  3. Tea-Watered down...Need to put more leaves in it to make sure the tea has flavor.  The service here was good, four stars.

It's just that I'm used to getting it for $4.50 at home, so the price threw me off a bit.   The Red Wontons tasted exceptional: boiled pork wontons soaking in a soy sauce/vinegar/sesame oil/red chili oil/ garlic concoction. They were in fact so good, we devoured them in 3 seconds and promptly ordered another serving.  The thing is, MSG in large quantities is detrimental to my looks. I bloat, retain water, get headaches and puffy eyes, not to mention a general feeling of listlessness throughout the remainder of the day. After thoroughly slurping up the entire contents of my meal, I had all of the above symptoms. And since I hadn't eaten for 3 days as I was trying to be cute and skinny in my new bikini for Tao Beach, I can safely assume this place was the culprit.  Noodle Asia sabotaged my game.",

What a RIP this place is, but it's Vegas, and why would you want to take a taxi to Asia town to get some good chinese food, when you're half drunk.   Some of the stuff is pretty good, but some other dishes please send back to the kitchen. YUCK. Don't order the congee, the pot stickers, or the egg rolls. Please order the Shanghai noodles, the rice cakes, ho fun, or chow mein. Those will do wonders if you're home sick for some old fashion Chinese noodle dishes!

    "text": "My partner and I went to Noodle Asia the day we arrived in Las Vegas.  We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.  There was an extremely long wait to get seated - and there were only three parties ahead of ours (one of which had 6 people, the others were couples).  It also took a very long time to get anything to drink and to have our order taken; this was at lunchtime so perhaps they were understaffed.  Fortunately the food arrived quickly after we ordered it, and when we were ready to leave, my doggie bag was brought quickly.  I was quite disappointed in the food, however.  When a restaurant is specifically advertised as having multiple vegetarian dishes, I expect them to be either marked with an icon or in their own section - but here, I had to ask the hostess to explain what dishes on the menu were vegetarian.  There were not many of them, although she claimed that a few could be \"made vegetarian\" by leaving out meat.  (I am always skeptical of this, because very often they use beef broth anyway.)  I ordered the Buddha's Feast noodles and my partner ordered the Shanghai Noodles; hers were much better than mine.  The atmosphere at Noodle Asia is not good at all.  It's mostly sheltered from the casino, but wide-open to the sports book.  I did not enjoy staring at 87 TV's showing all kinds of sports while I ate.  If you are already at the Venetian and craving Asian food, but you can't afford Tao, then Noodle Asia is not too bad.  But otherwise, I'd stay far away from this restaurant.",

Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice - best entree, but more sausage/egg/veggies would have been nice. Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - Not bad. Siu Mai - Nope!  All out. Har Gow - Nope!

    "text": "I've only been to 3 noodle places in Vegas, but Noodle Asia has been the best so far.  The others I've tried are Noodles at Bellagio and Beijing Noodle #9 at Caesars.  It seems like we always go here on a late Friday night after coming from the airport.  The dishes I've had have all been really good.  The noodles in the Szechwan Beef are amazing..  really fresh.  The Chicken Stir-Fried Soft Noodles are pretty good.  Probably my favorite is the Buddha Feast Pan-Toasted Noodles.  My gf gets it all the time cuz it's vegetarian, but you can add meat (I like mine with chicken..  it comes out to be the same price as the Chicken Stir-Fried Soft Noodles).  Every time I get something other than that, I end up wishing I'd just gotten it instead.  Noodles at Bellagio also has pan-toasted noodles.  I think they call it Hong Kong style noodles, or Cantonese noodles, or something like that.  I don't know whether it was a fluke, but contrary to Noodle Asia's, they were gross.  Extremely salty.  Like salty enough for your mouth to feel like it's getting too much salt, and for you to wonder whether your blood pressure will be adversely affected by it.  blech.  Back to Noodle Asia.  They run a tight ship.  Service is prompt and good.  You can see them cooking your food.  The food is good.  It might seem a little pricey for what it is, but it's worth it I think.  All around an excellent place.",

My husband had the beef brisket soup noodle and it is just like being in China. This place is one place u would always come back to. One day, we ate there twice. For lunch and dinner, just can't get enough of Noodle Asia, and oh did i mention that service is fast.

Being that I was told that Kevin Wu, the proprietor of the original Royal Star Dim Sum seafood restaurant in the Venetian, was the creator of Noodle Asia, I got excited being that for more than half a decade, I frequented Royal Star in both Santa Monica as well as in the Venetian before it closed its doors.  NO DIM SUM.  PHOOEY. But alas, when I arrived, there was barely any Dim Sum available.  It seems that nothing more is available other than rice & noodle dishes.  I'm not even going to go through any of the dishes I've ordered over the visits I've had there because... well, you're not really gonna go here for the food.  You're gonna go here if you want something of reasonable quality QUICKLY and at a good price.  GREAT FOR GRINDERS: Here's the menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.venetian.com%2FuploadedFiles%2FThe_Venetian%2FDining%2FCasual_Dining%2FnoodleAsia.pdf&s=0d018dfb21b1eeee50a1af3bb1e46c07e4c4d0e6c32a0d4a3a059bad64a199ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">venetian.com/uploadedFil...</a>  I would describe the cuisine here as more \"filling\" that \"delicious\".  If you're in the Venetian Poker Room and need to carb up quickly, this is a great place to get served quickly, shovel down some food that's very edible, pay the bill, and get back to the next sit-and-go.  RELATIVELY CHEAP: And if you're on a budget or you're a cheap assed Blackjack player, Noodle Asia is likely a great place to get filled up on reasonably priced food - relative to typical Vegas restaurants in a 4-star hotel.   ...But for an amazing gastronomical experience, the dim sum are way, way, WAY tastier & better presented at Woo (at the Palazzo), albeit at prices 3x more expensive.  CONCLUSION: Average food in good quantity at prices to match.  3-Stars.",

Yeah I know it's Vegas blah blah blah, but still!  Food like this is dirt cheap normally.  Anyway, the chinese sausage fried rice... Y-U-M.  They give you A LOT too.  I have also tried the BBQ Pork/Duck with rice dish and it was just alright.  Spring for the chinese sausage fried rice though!",

Thankfully we made it and it was worth running in heels for. We ordered the duck noodle soup. I'm not kidding you, the broth is god sent and amazing and the noodles were delectable! It was worth the $13 price tag. The bowl was large enough to share between us two girls and left us wanting more. The cool thing was that we weren't even drunk to have to enjoy some delicious comfort food!",

Shumai - probably the best I've ever had. Since having shumai here, nowhere else's has compared.  Mongolian beef - lots of flavor! And just enough spiciness.  Those are my favorites, but as I said earlier, everything I've had here is really tasty. It's nice that it's open late, too. Service is mediocre at best, but for this place, the good food outweighs the service.",

Shitshow on a dish is putting it very gently - the duck had no meat and was boney, the pork was chewy and everything was overseasoned and salty. The thing that changed it around was the wonton soup, which was perfectly seasoned, refreshing and the dumplings had the perfect ratio of filling and wrapper. Service was quick and straightforward, which I also like.",

Vegas is full of restaurants which means tons of options for customers to choose from -- so, service needs to set you apart. In this case, their unfriendly customer service took their star rating down by two. The reason for losing the third star was the food; the combo lo mein/noodles were prepared with lots of green peppers which is a huge negative given: 1) the menu description made no mention of the entree having green peppers, and 2) our palates despise green peppers. Also, for the price ($16.95 per entree), there should've been much more seafood, chicken and bbq pork. So, pretty much an expensive disappointment all around.",

He even compared it to the ones in Taiwan!  I had to try for myself.  And boy was he right.  Who would've even thought that it would be in Vegas that I discover my love for beef noodle soup?!  In the Venetian too of all places?!?!  The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup (btw - it's not spicy in case you're wondering) is a clear winner, with a super flavorful broth and noodles that are soft and not overly chewy.  The beef itself is cooked so perfectly that it's so tender!  Just this one time visit has had me wanting to come back for more.  It is now a forever staple for every visit to come, and it is not only delicious, but also absolutely heavenly after a night of too much drinking.  It's authentic and the place is clean too!  I also had the pho and shrimp chive dumplings, both of which were also good, but nothing compared to the beef noodle soup.  I'd recommend them if you don't want beef noodle soup, but if it was one thing I'd have to call out and get... you know my answer.  The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup.  No doubt about it.",

They also open till 3am so it's perfect for after clubbing comfort food if you don't want to go far. Will be back for more of those noods!",

It is not in steam carts it's off the menu.Nice place to have in the casino, really good food though shrimp and chive dumplings were also great had to do double. It's a little small inside and reminds me of a diner or small Chinese cafe.",

    "text": "Okay...I'm giving this place 4 stars.  BUT there are some serious issues that would probably make me put fewer if this were just a run of the mill random chinese restaurant.  First, this place offers a mix of authentic and american style chinese dishes.  My two favorite things on their menu are their hot and spicy tripe (traditional szechuan dish) and their scallop (conpoy) congee.  Pretty much, these two dishes are the reason why I come to this place.  MAJOR upside.  Downside...the last THREE times I have been to this restaurant they have not been able to serve my two favorite dishes.  They claim to be out of scallops and tripe...which is possible, but I suspect they removed them from the menu and just haven't updated yet.    This place is located in a busy casino (Venetian, Las Vegas Strip).  If you like that then good...if you don't then don't come here.  It is loud, busy if you come at a typical service hour, and hectic.  Personally, I don't mind any of that and its the perfect late night snack place.  I've ended lots of nights with a spicy dish of tripe and joy at this location.  Service is rushed and somewhat unprofessional.  I personally feel like I might be mistreated here because I am not chinese.  Staff always question me if I order an authentic dish like I'm a two year old...even though I've been coming here for years.   Its True that it is somewhat pricey for this type of chinese food, but you are in a major casino.  you're going to pay a premium for anything you buy at the venetian.  if you want a more typical authentic chinese experience you should definitely check out some of the spots in Chinatown.  Totally different energy than on the strip.  I will be back here soon...and you people better have my tripe ready!!!!",

Thus, my expectation was Chinese vegetables, shitake mushrooms, maybe some wheat gluten (vegetarian meat).  What I got was canned chop suey vegetables (water chestnut, canned mushrooms) over noodles.  But the portion was large.",

If you stay in the Venetian and are craving Chinese food, this is surprisingly one of the best restaurants that you'll find. If you want to venture out into that Chinatown plaza off the strip for better options, that's totally up to you! Since I prefer to stay around the area, this is the best value and quality that you'll get in any Vegas casino restaurant.   Depending on what time you go (lunch or dinner), you'll encounter a bit of a wait. There is enough seating to go around, and the wait staff do their best to assure that you won't wait too long.   Whenever I come here, I like to go all out, so I order two bowls of their Won Ton and Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup. Sometimes, I'll even come back twice in one day and order different menu items. I would recommend you try the Red Won Ton appetizers, Bbq Pork And Roasted Duck Rice Plate, and/or Mongolian Beef with Chinese Broccoli. I was quite impressed that the food tastes like what you'll find at Monterey Park. This is definitely my go-to place for Chinese food in Vegas!",

All the dishes were super delicious and very authentic (southern China). The Szechwan beef were soft and tender and the noodles were chewy. The stir fries were well flavored and cooked to the perfect condition. The red wontons were excellently spiced. The crispy noodle was something quite different.   The portions were massive and great value for money.   Their buba tea was yummy as well.  The waitress was friendly and certainly very helpful and provided us some good recommendations.  My top 3 favorite restaurant in California  Would definitely revisit! Highly recommend to everyone!!

Got a small hot n sour soup and a large egg flower soup (because I couldn't choose just one) but could have done without the hot n sour. It wasn't the best I've had but it was good! LOVED the egg flower soup. Was savory, not salty at all, and got rid of my headache. Har gow was amazing. I kept raving about it as I was eating it. It was like a little pillow of shrimp every time I ate it. The green beans also had a nice blend of garlic and basil.   Service was good too. Yum! Thanks Noodle Asia.",

    "text": "Came here on a late night, we were all hungry and didnt want to leave our hotel. Its conveniently located near The Venetian which is not too long of a walk from The Palazzo where we stayed.  We received $25 credit voucher upon checking in and decided to use it on the day we visited.  We walked in around 11:30 PM and this restaurant was full. All customers dining in seem to be all Chinese as they spoke their language. We sat down after waiting a couple minutes and looked at the menu. I was a bit unpleasant because the host and the servers all just started speaking Chinese to us. We clearly told them we are not Chinese and that we cannot speak the language but even after then, they kept wanting to communicate with us in CHINESE that I cant even understand.  We ordered Mapo Tofu, Dan Dan Mian (DDM)and Vegetable Noodle Soup. I didnt get to try the noodle because it didnt look too appetizing. My DDM was pretty good. It wasnt too bad as someone else has shared in his or her review. For the price, it did its job. Mapo Tofu was savory and the texture of soft tofu was very pleasing. It has that firey flavor that you cant ever have cooking it at home. Portion was very very large. Overall, our meal was satisfying.  We asked for a check and got it after trying for I dont know how long but definitely long enough. We got some other table's check before we got ours and the server gave us a weird look when we said this isnt our check. I mean, you gave us the wrong check so why are you making US look bad?  Plus, our server kept talking to us in Chinese which I was very offended by because we have already told them earlier so many times. Obviously, we couldnt communicate. There was not even one person who could speak fluent English.  We tried to use our voucher and gave the server our room number. We waited for 10 minutes or more and she comes back saying she cant let us use this voucher because she couldnt verify our room number. We had 2 rooms reserved so gave them both of our numbers and she just couldnt do it for no reason.  Ended up just paying out of pocket and wasted our voucher. It was very frustrating and she didnt even try to put some effort into making it work. Of course, there was no apology in anyway for taking forever and making us wait for longer than you think you know.  Food was OK but because of lacking in customer service and professionalism, I doubt I will eat here again.",

    "text": "The last time I had Noodle Asia was yeaars ago. I guess I forgot to leave a yelp review. I remember thinking that it was pretty good. Pricey, but good. The good news is that after all these years, Noodle Asia still remains good.  My girlfriend and I came here on our first night in Vegas with a voracious appetite. We ordered...  Beef chow fun: They can definitely make a good beef chow fun here. There's nothing more comforting than a big fresh mountain of noodles, beef, and onions; all packing that signature wok hei flavor.  Black pepper beef udon: A flavorful dish with just enough sauce/gravy so that it isn't overpowering or dry. It was good, but this was my girlfriend's choice.  Thai fried rice: I'm a huge fan of fried rice, whereas my girlfriend isn't. I thought that the rice was good. I could taste the basil in it, but my girlfriend thought otherwise.  We also came back a second night. My friend got me and another friend kicked out of Encore Beach Club. I got back to the room around 2ish and wanted to eat something other than White Castle... so off to Noodle Asia we went.  Cantonese beef stew w/ rice: I'm not sure, but I feel like this is a pretty random item to order. I personally enjoy it because of the hearty cuts of tender beef, onions, bell pepper, and a nice thick gravy that pairs well with jasmine rice. The rice doesn't soak up the gravy so it's a nice balance between dry and saucy.  My girlfriend also ordered rice porridge. I personally thought it was really bland, so I only had a couple bites before I was over it.  Noodle Asia offers up some authentic Chinese food with average portions. I understand that the prices are high because they're on the strip. I just wish they gave a little more because of how pricey it is so I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. Thankfully the food is good! The other convenient part is that they're open until 3 which is perfect if you're in the mood for some comfort Chinese food after drinking and partying.",

However, their prices aren't bad compared to other casino restaurants, and their portions are very reasonable. The line here can be super long, so come early for dinner, or late for lunch if you want to avoid the rush. We came around 5:15pm on a Saturday and the line was already about a 20-30 minute wait for a party of 3. We tried:  -Soy Sauce Chicken ($9.95, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fHvZE-Oc1QVsIaTZxRAIPQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): WOW, super flavorful and tender! This was bordering on the salty side when eaten by itself, but it was really good with rice- Recommended! -Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup ($14.95, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sZ-7G0GzyqAGgCqMx0Lp7A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Solid beef noodle soup, although I wish it were spicier. The noodles had a nice chew, and the broth was flavorful. They added a lot of beef to the soup, and it had a good mix of tendon and meat- recommended. -Hong Kong Won Ton Noodle Soup ($12.95): Solid, but nothing special. The soup was a bit bland, and I wouldn't pay this amount to order this again. -Chinese Broccoli w/Oyster Sauce ($12.95): Yum- the Chinese broccoli was very fresh and cooked perfectly, and still very crispy.   I saw some other tables order the roast duck, and that looked really well done. Service is ok- the floor manager is really good, and knows what she's doing. However, they are pretty short staffed here so you'll need to flag servers down when needed. Make sure you ask for some of their hot sauce if you like spicy food! If craving Asian food on my next trip to Vegas, I would definitely come back to Noodle Asia!",

    "text": "I was at the sports book in the Venetian.  My team was up by 20 points with 5 minutes to play, so started scrolling through Yelp ordered by distance.  Skipped over Noodle Asia, right at the top, because of the mediocre rating.   Scrolled through about 100 other places, either with 2 to 3 stars,  or,  if rated higher,  entrees were like $48.  Nothing sounded worth it, so went out to catch the bus.  But on the way to the restroom,  there was Noodle Asia,  packed with Chinese diners,  with bustle and flair,  and one of my fave dishes, pork & duck noodle soup, for $12.95.   This IS the Strip.  That IS a decent price on the Strip.  Didn't wait to get seated, just went to the bar seats facing the kitchen.  Ordered in two minutes, and three minutes later came the soup (they are all hustling SUPER fast and competent there).  The broth was tasty,  the noodles had great definition and were perfectly toothy,  and there were huge, plentiful hunks of succulent pork and duck.   Totally, totally enjoyable and worthwhile.   Paying the bill took seconds.  5 stars because:  so quick,  so tasty,  such a huge pile of delish pork & duck,  so efficient,  great atmosphere,  genuine feel - - and, also: location, location, location!  [The guy next to me had a chicken dish.   Loads and loads of lumps of chicken.  I felt sorry for him, but then again, I loathe chicken.  The other dishes I saw coming out also looked a bit simplistically meat-heavy.  But I was super happy with my noodle bowl.]",

    "text": "The food here is a little overpriced for the caliber of food that they serve. The flavor was pretty good but I found that their steak in their \"chef's Special\" Beef Medallions was extremely fatty and chewy. As if the chef didn't think the dish was special enough to trim off the parts that did not have good texture. Texture in this case definitely subtracted from the flavor. The sauce was delicious and it went very well with white rice.  The Chow mein noodle dish was excellent. The beef was thinly sliced, not fatty. It was not as good as the chinese food that I am familiar with in San Francisco's Chinatown, but I suspect that since many people may not really be accustomed to top shelf chinese cuisine, I am fairly certain that the cook(s) could care less.   The potstickers were out of this world as was their shrimp dim sum appetizer.  They are very busy here because it is in the middle of the Venetian Hotel. Therefore, they really may not care that much as I can see the wait staff were racing around non-stop. It was a nice experience, the staff were all very kind, clean and professional although a tad understaffed according to the anxious energy output and equally anxious non-verbal cues that they were indeed overwhelmed.   I am not sure overwhelmed staff pairs well with underwhelming food but I give them 4 stars altogether. I will give the benefit of the doubt along with a %20 tip but if I come here in the future, they will need to step up their game.",

Our food came out much faster than my expectations and also exceeded my taste expectations! We ordered the schezuan beef soup and chick mushroom vegetable soup which both hit the spot.

We paid less than $10 for the \"bowl\" size and honestly, it was big enough to fill us both up for the night. While it took awhile for them to get the soup to us (it was pretty busy), the workers were still pretty attentive and helpful to us, even if we were hanging out outside. The guy who packed our soup taped down the lid and make sure to include spoons and napkins (major plus for caring)!  The soup itself? DELICIOUS. It was exactly what we needed to comfort us after a long day.  Next time we go we're definitely coming back for the Egg Drop Soup here!",

It is right next to the big screen tv/sports betting area and you can watch sports while you eat through the huge glass windows.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with their food.  Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup- Very good! I like it just as much as the places in Rowland or SGV! Chewy noodles with a dark beefy soy/vinegary broth and lots of tender beef chunks. The only thing is i wish it had some MORE greens in it than the skimpy green onions. Perhaps some cilantro/onion and the chopped pickled mustard greens or bokchoy like the other places. Overall delicious but the soup gets hella salty towards the end be warned.  Spicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup- NOT spicy at all. Tastes pretty bland. Its not seafood broth or chicken or beef broth. Can't really distinguish what the base taste is. Even with 2 generous scoops of Chili sauce it wasn't really spicy. I would skip this next time, however other people liked it.  Hot and Sour Soup- Loved it! I was wary since some reviews say it is not good but we liked it alot! Good balance of sour in my opinion and lots of toppings  Pho Special- $18 for a bowl of Pho better be good and it was according to my fellow Vietnamese diners! So if you can't make it to Pho Kim Long, here is a back up! (Another Pho back-up would be ordering the \"Zen Noodles\" at Grand Lux Cafe)   Overall, i wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you staying in the Venetian and can't make it out to Chinatown but crave some asian food, Noodle Asia will do!",

Caesar's had a Chinese restaurant serving soup, but I didn't feel like paying $15 to $20 for a bowl, and then I remembered hearing about Noodle Asia's Won Ton Soup.  I went there for a late lunch during a week day, and it took a while before anybody sat me, even though the restaurants wasn't crowded.   I did get my order taken quickly, though, and the food came out within a few minutes.  I ordered the Won Ton soup (no noodles), and it was slightly bland but soothing.  The won tons were really good, though I wish they didn't have shrimp in them since I'm allergic.  The bowl was about $8.  It took forever to flag someone down to get a check, but I was satisfied with my meal.",

We were ignored and eventually had to chase someone down to pay, then again to correct overcharging for items. It was an extremely bizarre experience all the way around.   Vegetarian options are very limited and my shrimp dish had only 4 shrimp for a TON of noodles. Several people enjoyed their meals at our table, but more people did not.

I'm a sucker for those... definitely not as good as the ones in the bay area, but not complaining. I split it with my friend actually, and it didn't seem like enough, but after a few minutes of sitting around waiting for the check, I felt satisfied.

Food- full of flavor and seemed fresh.  They offered a good selection of entrees. 2. Staff- friendly and somewhat fast service. 3. Ambience- not too upscale, not rundown, but juuuust right. 4. Value- It's Vegas and the Venetian! Lol, but considering that, it wasn't too pricey. 5. Hours- I loved this place because it's one of the restaurants that close the latest.  Afterall, it is Vegas and you don't want dinner too late in the morning lol.  By the way, they usually close at 3 a.m.  CONS:  1. Location- If you're not staying at the Venetian, it will be a little hike to get to the restaurant, but it might just be worth it (especially if you love Chinese food). 2. Pricing- I mentioned it above, but if you're looking for a low-cost meal, this isn't the place to go to.  You'll probably spend around $50-$100 for a full course meal for two (including tip and depending on how inebriated you might be).",

I had ordered Singapore mei-fei which was salty and all noodles were broken as it was over-cooked. My co-worker ordered Vietnamese noodle soup which was good but the side condiments which needs to go into the soup came out 5 minutes AFTER the we had started eating. No point of having them at all. Chicken noodle soup was the worst of all. Soup was bland and not very tasteful, noodles were extremely over-cooked that it was mushy. It seem like it was made awhile ago. Co-worker took 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore. Both noodle soups were just warm, not good when you were expecting nice hot soup.

The food is very authentic considering its inside Venetian with all the gambling going on. It's one of the best noodle house I've been too. Their shrimp wonton is really good. I also like their porridge.  It's a simple menu but it's all good. They even have kimchi. One of the reason I can't give them 5 stars is because of their service.  It's a busy restaurant  and it's open late, I guess the employees are tired but the services is little slow and non communicative.  But overall the food is solid. The price is little expensive for noodles but you are in Venetian, the rent must be outrageous.",

Are you in the middle of the Western US desert, at one of the most heavily touristed venues in the world?  All told it's remarkable that you can get a totally legit bowl of noodles (for your first visit, have the Szechuan Beef Noodle, it's perfectly delicious) up until 3am, right at the Venetian. I suspect it's not the best-tasting or the most reasonably-priced bowl of noodles you'll ever have in your life, but compared to other post-nightclub eats (bacon-wrapped hot dogs in LA? super-greasy \"hidden pizza\" at The Cosmopolitan?) at post-midnight hours, this place really is a stand-out, and a rather well-staffed treat.

    "text": "I have to admit...I was fairly impressed that you could actually find decent Asian food at a hotel eatery.  I used to think that these joints were only offered by hotels as a way to satisfy their Asian clientele from overseas.  I mean, all those old Asian guys gotta find something to remind them of home while they take a break from Pai Gow right?  Prices are a bit steep relative to normal Asian places, but obviously there's going to be a premium for being where you're at.  They're probably betting that you're not going to go out somewhere off the strip in search of cheaper Chinese food in that desert heat.  And being a casino, they're taking the smart bet.  At least they don't cheat you on your order; portions are still pretty respectable.  For an appetizer, we grabbed the Spicy Tofu dish off the little menu card in those plastic holders on the table. I was expecting to get cubes, but it turned out to be thin slices off a tofu block that had been stir fried and then triangled. There were approximately 10 slices or so, and the whole thing was spiced up wtih chili oil sauce.  Taste was pretty good and there was certainly a bit of kick, but there had to be just based on the amount of that oil on the plate.  Seriously, I imagine a little part of health freaks would die if they saw this dish (i wonder if I should even bother calling it a \"sauce\").    The Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Lo Mein?...not sure of the spelling) was touted by one of my friends as possibly the best he's ever had outside of Taiwan (and apparently, one of the the spiciest based on the beads of sweat rolling down his head).  Three of the four of us ended up getting it based on how much he kept talking about the dish (my other friend ordered the Cantonese Beef Stew instead).  The broth was flavorful and it didn't seem too bad with the sodium level.  Certainly no worse than the average bowl of pho.  There were some good size chunks of meat to go with the noodles, so it certainly will help get you full.  Not too bad of a find for a hotel eatery, especially if you want to lay off some of that rich food in the buffet.  Three stars if only because I can't afford to give one more after all these inflated prices.  That said, it's still probably one of the more cost effective meals you can find, so you could do worse in that regard.  And btw, that broth really isn't all that spicy, so I don't think you have to worry about sweating like my friend.",

Everytime we asked a question to the waitress her attitude was that she was so high above everyone else, and was simply answering our question just because she wants to get paid.  We had the Hot and Sour soup, Beef fried rice, and the BBQ Pork and Duck.  The Hot and Sour soup was pretty good, tasted like all the other chain Chinese restaurants here in Canada.  The Beef fried rice was also pretty good, well seasoned, nice beef taste  The BBQ Pork and Duck I was very disappointed with. The first bite I took was greeted with a million sharp shards of bones. Both the Pork and Duck were really dry, and of course served with some even drier rice.  Another problem is the rice to meat ratio. You can tell this restaurant does not care about details or quality when they just shoved about 3 bowls of rice onto a plate topped with a couple pieces of meat. I'm not complaining about the meat, I would have rather they  not give me a bunch of rice which I am not going to eat. I am Asian and when you eat meat with your rice you usually take a bite of the meat, and a spoonful of rice. Well that's what I did (the meat and rice were very dry I had to drink a cup of water after each bite) and I did not even finish half the rice, not even a quarter.  Very disappointed, wasn't worth the 30 minute line outside for food I could have gotten at a chain Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "For Chinese food in Vegas, Noodle Asia is fairly decent for noodle/soup-ish related items (China Grill at Mandalay Bay is better for other dishes I think). The won ton soup is pretty good-- nice flavors and whatnot, though I do think all the dishes here are a bit overpriced. But hey, it's Vegas, where everything is grossly overpriced.  Service is also a little bit slow for some things. Especially for big groups, it would be nice if all the food could come out at the same time, rather than having some people wait extra time.  Location wise, it's right in the middle of the Venetian, next to the casino floor, and we probably would not have come here if it was not for the fact that we were staying at the Venetian and it was convenient and it was soupy.  tl;dr: Yummy soups and noodles, but a bit pricey for what you're getting (though I don't know why you would be expecting something cheap...)",

Overall, I may not come back here next time I visit the Venetian.. I would probably look for another restaurant",

Im so grateful that such a tasty place is open so late at night till 4am i believe. I was so enamored with the place we decided to come back again for brunch the next day. Equally tasty sober or buzzed!  really after a night of fun and looking for something comforting for the tummy this really is the place to come to!  next time i stop in vegas again i'll be sure to swing on by back at anytime.",

Chicken Congee (to go)  Conclusions: *Food as a whole was delicious, but not particularly outstanding. *Service was not timely, and some dishes arrived as some of our friends finished theirs. (Namely the sichuan beef noodle soup) *Expect typical exorbitant Las Vegas mark-up on food. (Especially the dimsum) *Restaurant was very clean and provided a good seat for watching the big screens for sports betting.",

The combination soft noodle (chow mein) $16 is excellent. Comes with bbq pork, chicken, duck and others I can't remember. The best chow mein i ever tried. Not too oily or overpowering in flavor. Just perfect.   The bbq pork and duck with rice is also great. $12.  The beef noodle also great. I'm not a soup kind of guy but I do remember that soup. Was good.  They have little dim sum items also.   The service is always fast and polite. Sit at the bar. You get to watch the chef in action.   Overall excellent place to get a bite solo or in a group.

The soup was not the greatest. The servers over that weekend may have been a bit overwhelmed by the crush of people but ours was particularly mean. When we asked her what vegetarian options were available her answer initially was we have none and then she paused and said these two dishes are. Then my friend asked would it be possible to get these dishes just without the meat. Her response it will be the same price.... Thoughts that doesn't answer his question. He was polite and said that's ok. I just want it without the neat. Her response ok ok but still same price... Ok lady we get it. This all did not make a good impression on us. I would not recommend this place to anyone, however their iced coffee is delicious. If you like that sort of thing grab one to go while you explore the casino floor.",

I had the bbq park and roast duck with rice as well as the wontons and pot stickers. Nothing spectacular but not horrible either. The wontons were too salty. The pot stickers had a good fried crunch on the outside but the meat inside was not that great. Bbq pork was flavorful but the roast duck was just fatty.

The atmosphere was well done,  and it did have a reasonable selection of traditional and mildly exotic Pan Asian choices.   The food itself was average, though the prices were quite high. We ordered kung pao chicken and orange chicken, and one soda. The bill was over $50.  The portion sizes were large, but the taste was very run of the mill. I don't mind paying extra for quality, but it just wasn't there.   I didn't find the service particularly good either. My entree was brought out  about 10 minutes prior to my wife's without apparent cause, and we had to actively flag down or waitress for a water refill or to get the check.   I don't believe this restaurant would remain in business if not for the convenience factor of its location. There are many,  many other excellent choices in the Venetian complex alone. I personally would have been happier with Panda Express. The food was about the same for a third of the price.",

We ordered two dishes, one was the shrimp won ton noodle soup and the other was the bbq pork and roasted duck over rice. They were both DELICIOUS! The taste was very authentic and the portions were a good size.  The only downside to this place is the service. It's pretty sub-par only because it gets really busy and the servers don't really check up on you after the food arrives. They also use tea bags in the teapot which I thought was lame and unauthentic but the food made up for everything else.",

It wasn't busy at all and we were seated immediately. The waiter promptly greeted us and made some appetizer suggestions. We went with edamame and red wontons. The edamame was cooked with anise and had a good flavor. Even better when you make a sauce mix from the soy sauce and hot pepper sauce on the table and dip the edamame in it. The red pork wontons were very flavorful too. Very good.  The food came out so quickly and was piping hot. I thoroughly enjoyed my Cantonese beef noodle soup. The noodles were cooked just right, fresh baby bok choy, tender beef and tendon, and hearty broth. Just the way I like it. Yes, it's a little pricy for Chinese food but it's expected being on the strip and located in the gorgeous Venetian hotel and casino.   I wouldn't hesitate to come back for some more noodle soup. Really want to try the schezuan beef noodle soup based on the other Yelp reviews. Next time for sure!",

    "text": "Was really excited about discovering this place on Yelp because we were craving Asian food in Vegas. The hostess greeted us in Chinese, and about 75% or so of the customers were Chinese (and not even American Chinese I think) so I assumed it would be an authentic experience. My boyfriend ordered the Sichuan style beef noodle soup and I ordered a mapo tofu which came with a bowl of Jasmine rice. The noodles came fast since I guess more people order noodle dishes than rice dishes. I had to wait extra 15 minutes or so for mine to come. The noodle soup was actually pretty good; it did tasted like braised meat-based soup I've had in China but maybe the flavor was a bit too intense and salty than what I've had in the past. Still pretty good though; the beef pieces in the soup were too cube-y and thus not very tender. The noodles were good quality but not sure if it was hand-pulled there or they just bought good quality ones that were frozen. The mapo tofu was kind of sweet and Americanized - probably closer to the kind I would get in Japan or Korea rather than in Sichuan. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. Tofu was also very firm and not silky. Unless you're dying to eat not so authentic but not exactly P.F. Chang style Chinese food, I'd skip this place.",

I would definitely pass on this soup.   I also got the Chinese Broccoli, which was quickly blanched and topped with oyster sauce.  This was okay, I was glad it wasn't oily.

My friend introduced it to me one summer and said it was the best beef noodle soup she's ever had. I was skeptical at first, and maybe a little drunk too, since we had just come from a pool party. I was exhausted and beyond hungry, so the first time I ever had Noodle Asia's Beef Noodle Soup, I was sold. It was ridiculously good and it definitely hit the spot. Ever since my first time here in the Summer of 2012, I've kept coming back.  I've tried their other dishes (only because someone else orders it haha) such as minced beef over rice, duck over rice, pepper chow mein and potstickers all are very good but nothing compares to their beef noodle soup! It's so hot with a hint of spiciness to it. The beef is tender and oh, the bits of fat connected to the beef is the best! I crave this soup when I'm back in SF. I wish I could have some right now.  It's a bit pricey because it's probably the only asian restaurant on the strip but it's sooo worth it!",

Spicy broth.  Soft noodles.  Tender meat.  The kimchee is $6.50.  Yes, I know that is expensive kimchee.  And yes, I order it every time (and side note: Noodles at Bellagio has $7 kimchee, I will never order it again).  It's also right next to the sports book so you can catch a glimpse of some of the games, which is a plus in my book.  Warning: if you bring Chinese people with you, you will probably hear about how unauthentic and expensive this place is for the duration of your entire meal.  The kitchen is open, so you can see all the cooks and they're Chinese.  Rub that one in.  True story: I tried to bribe the guy $100 to reopen the restaurant 5 minutes after it closed at 3am.  He thought about it.  For maybe 30 seconds.  Then we were forced to leave empty handed to the terribleness that is Grand Lux Cafe.  Never again.",

I split the following with the gf:  Hong Kong Won Ton (just okay), Shanghai Rice Cake (Shanghai cabbage with seasoned pork, wok-tossed in a mild soy sauce - the rice cakes were overcooked.  I like 'em much firmer), and Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice (With egg whites and thinly sliced Chinese broccoli stems - not bad).  Add in 2 very small chrysanthemum teas and you easily rack up $48 bucks and some change sans tip.  For that amount, you can feast.    Not worth it.  At least for me.",

My visit here was horrible!! and whatever your definition of horrible is I must say I agree. We ordered our food @ exactly 11:11 my fiance's rice arrived at 11:35 not bad right?  24 minutes after ordering I'm sure the food is gonna be great. Around 11:40 umm where is my  food? (we ask athe server)  I then taste his rice and oh yes his rice is really good. 11:45 I still don't have  my food 11:48 okay? well now that he's done eating I think we should pay for what we ordered. I tell the server to please give us the check, he then tries to give us the check and the rest of our order to go! I was like really? really? I told him I don't want the food and that we will only pay for what we received. Not one person gave us an explanation on why we never received the rest of our order and or tried to appologize for what happened. I was upset and hungry, not a good combination but hey my fances combination fried rice was delicious. So unless you have time for someone else to waste your time, go right ahead and enjoy the food!",

First off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.  We were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.  Like I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.  Two stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.  Another fine review by S.G. Whoop, whoop, whoop!",

I got the Beef Noodle Soup which is very much like the taiwanese style beef noodle soup and i wasn't disappointed at all!  A little oilier than what I'm used to but the broth seemed cleaner than what I'm also used to which was a plus!  They weren't shady on the beef either!  The bowl was a little pricey of course!  But hey, being in the Palazzo, what do you expect. My pretty little beef noodle soup cost me $17 with tax and tip!  Yikes!  Being asian, I know that I can get a bowl like this for $7 but oh well, it's vegas!  My cousin got the duck noodle soup and she said her duck was really salty.

Another visit to the Las Vegas pig-out-on-authentic-Chinese-cuisine-slice-of-Heaven that has spoiled me for any other Chinese food in existence. My partner found it during one of his business trips to LV and took me for dinner the very next time we vacationed there. We've been to Sin City six times, and four out of those six, we had most of our lunches and many dinners here at Noodle Asia in the Venetian.  It's not a very big place at all, and if you didn't know what to look for you'd probably just assume that it's another one of those chain places like Panda Bowl and pass it right by.  And if you did that, friend, you were dead wrong. Next time, back it up and go in. It's the gastronomic equivalent of putting a quarter in the Wheel Of Fortune machine and hitting the Grand Prize.  Everything is light, crispy, fresh and always served piping hot. I tend to judge any Chinese place by the quality of their egg and spring rolls, and Noodle Asia's are the kind I wish I could have shipped to my home by the dozen. Not heavy, greasy or stuffy as the more conventional egg rolls, I could just keep ordering these for the entire meal.  And then the sesame peanut noodles. My GOD. Is it dessert, or is it dinner? One mouthful, and it doesn't even matter any more. Is it possible for your tongue to have multiple orgasms? I'm pretty sure mine did.   Sadly, it's been a couple of years or more since our last LV visit, and I've had dreams about eating at Noodle Asia (oh, yeah, I got it THAT bad.) I've never been a real big seafood fanatic, but I'm pretty sure that those dishes are as awesome as everything else they have, and if I'm lucky, I may get to find out someday.  Meanwhile, if and when you stop by this wonderful place, can you find a way to sneak some spring rolls back to me? I'd be forever in your debt...  ;-)",

I hate to say this but this is by far fast food material. There is absolutely nothing authentic about their dishes. Everything is quick and easy and they charge an arm and leg for the choices you get. The pho...broth taste like boiled water. The pineapple fried rice... Where's the pineapple!? If im paying double digits on this. I best see you serve it in a pineapple to show me that your not using CANS!? The only choice that was decent was the beef stew with noodles. It definitely needs a little veg on the side though.. I don't mean to bash on them. I mean. I have to say they are crazy smart to open a fast food Asian cuisine that charges the same price as an upscale Asian fusion restaurants in NYC. Props to them for banking it. But for a kid who grew up eating nothing but Asian foods in a diverse city. There is no comparison.",

In one year, there were over 100 servers or busers got the job and quit, Why? Bad management! Does a server care to give good customer service when he/she does not feel love from the company? Who care to give a F when they are only consider as a Workers? Here comes a True story, it was the first day for a new buser, after over 4 hours non stop working, time for him to take a break and dinner, he found a dish of fried rice sat in the kichen for over 2 hours due to a special order made wrong, he microwaved it and started eating since only 30 mins break time. The manager on duty found that out, she gave the buser two options: pay for the dish and keep the job, or take the uniform off and leave immediately because he was violating the rule. For the food, different restaurants prepare their foods in different ways. Some people may like the taste and some don't. It is hard to tell the quarlity since some like extreme spicy and some like extreme the other way.",

The following day we decided to go there for lunch and boy, what a change of service.  The same waiters were working, yet they were terribly rude.  1. they forgot one of our drink orders and when we asked for it, the waiter's response was \"yea, and?\"  2. when we asked for extra vegetables they said they would charge an additional $2, then only brought out greens.  When we asked about the other vegetables, we got a total of 3 straw mushrooms and 3 slices of carrots...def not what I would consider \"extra\".  3.  when we asked to split checks the waiter acted like he didn't' understand and sent another waitress to our table as if our request was absurd.  4.  the waiter never came back to collect our cards, so I had to go to the front to give them our cards.",

    "text": "Before you judge me of giving a 5-star review to a Chinese restaurant in Vegas, I need to explain myself. Yes, I am surprised even at myself for giving a 5-star rating to a casual Chinese restaurant.  No, sweet & sour pork and lemon chicken are not in my repertoire of Chinese food.  No, I was not drunk when I visited the restaurant; and I think reviews by those who admitted being drunk and their judgement impaired should be tossed out.   I am picky so I do not like just anything.  I grew up in Hong Kong, have travelled to major Chinese cities, and have lived in both Vancouver and San Francisco for many years so I know my Chinese foods.  I do have to emphasize though that my rating is based on one dish that I had.  My parents and I were spending a few days in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  After coming out from \"O\", my parents retired to their room for the evening.  I was getting hungry even though we had a big lunch so I wandered around to check out the restaurants opening late in Palazzo / Venetian where we stayed.  I had been to Noodles in Bellagio and Zine in Palazzo.  Both were decent so I thought I would give Noodle Asia a try.  The menu is quite extensive.  The prices are very reasonable considering that it is a hotel restaurant.  I ordered a plate of fried rice with Chinese sausages, egg white and Chinese broccoli.  It didn't take long until a generous serving arrived.   It looked just as simple as the menu suggested with 3 ingredients and rice.  I took a bite and I said to myself, \"OMG.  This is the best fried rice I've ever had.\"  And it was, seriously, the best fried rice I've ever had anywhere!  The Chinese sausage slices were sweet and tender.  The egg whites were fluffy.  However, the rice was the star of the dish.  It was not browned with dark soy sauce and it has all the flavours from being fried in a hot and well-seasoned wok.    The plate was just under $14.  Although the restaurant is a essentially a cafe but it was far better than any $15 - $18 fried rice dishes served in many other well appointed restaurants.  A few weeks later and I still remember the dish.  My partner is going to Vegas for a conference in a couple of weeks and I told him he needed to go there and order the rice if he could only eat out once.",

I am not saying this was the best Szechwan beef noodle soup I have ever had in my life but during that moment, after a night of heavy drinking, it was perfect. Usually, pho would do the trick, but I think this will be my new hangover meal.  The broth was spiced just right. I did not have to add any other sauces or condiments, with the exception of more chili peppers because I like it very spicy. The beef came in large cubes and I honestly wished they added more just because it was that good. The noodles were perfect, tender but not mushy like it was over cooked.    The service was also great! My water glass never went more than half empty. The food came promptly and all within the same time!   Next time I am in Vegas, I will be here again.",

Well, ask yourself this: would a noodle restaurant located in the Venetian be able to survive if it WASN'T this good?  I keep coming back for the schezwan noodle soup (niu ro mein). The soup is so wonderfully rich and complex with just a hint of spiceness. It's so deliciously satisfying and soothing! The noodles have just the right amount of bite. I wish the meat was just a little bit more tender, but still very good nonetheless.   I still don't understand why they niu ro mein is so much better here than at any place I've had in Alhambra/Monterey Park. Shrugs...oh well.

Though everything here is quite pricey and two people ordering one entree each of either a noodle dish or a rice dish can easily end up with a bill of $40+ dollars, they use high quality ingredients I believe b/c I don't get the nasty feeling afterwards from low quality oil and/or ingredient like I get from some other cheaper Chinese restaurants.   At times, they do get super busy though.  You could be standing in line for 20-30 minutes waiting to be seated and then find out that you need to wait for another 30 minutes or more for your food.

And not as good as home, but they were sweet and hit the spot especially when you're hungover.  - Won Ton Soup: $5 for a cup. Yeah, again pricey! A cup consisted of 3 wontons and a piece of baby bok choy LOL. But again, sweet, soupy, and hit the spot!  - Beef Noodle Soup: My friend ordered this and loved it. I tasted her broth and it packed a punch! That satay flavor will creep up on your throat though! $13  - Combination pan fried noodles: I was actually really impressed with this dish! The noodles were crispy, and the sauce/gravy was really tasty. It also included lots of shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Good portion to do family style!  - Combination fried rice: $15 nothing special or memorable. But it's a good choice if you're looking for carbs.  Open late and conveniently located inside the Venetian. Perfect spot for late night soup after clubbing or that morning soup to get you going again!   EAT.SLEEP.RAVE.REPEAT.",

The service was great and we watched the football game while enjoying our food. Will be back!",

The food came out right away, so clearly it was premade. My fried rice was over $18 before tip! Our waiter was hard to understand and not very friendly. I would choose another place to eat next time around.",

People staying at this hotel expect a certain level of service and the people at noodle Asia don't deliver. But the food is amazing :) love it!",

    "text": "Having been to Vegas 7-8 times, I always seem to forget Noodle Asia - not in a bad way, because I've been there 3 times now.  But I never thought about writing a review because it's one of those places that you'd go for three reasons: 1) convenience, as it's located in Venetian, 2) hung over and need Chinese food, or 3) you want something other than fake PJ Chang Chinese food.  Tips: don't order dumplings, wonton soup, shu mai and other classic dishes that restaurants can make in big batches.  Go for dishes they actually have to stir-fry and cook.  Knowing to skip large-batch menu items, we went with the mushroom chicken noodle soup and curry beef stew.  For both dishes, they'd be considered above average in Chinatown, and definitely fantastic in Vegas strip.  Case in point, when I had their wonton soup and shu mai, they felt store-bought and under-seasoned.    There was one black mark during our visit - we ordered a Thai ice tea and they didn't have anymore.  But a few minutes later another waiter said they had one last cup - we happily accepted.  They added so much water to the Thai ice tea that it was a joke.  I found that to be shady.  Nevertheless stick with dishes that they HAVE to cook (and I don't mean fried rice), and you'll come away with a positive experience.",

Although their prices are higher than regular Chinese restaurants, we still love it because of their authentic noodle soups and the store hour. If you want to have a hot soup or a good noodles in the strip at late night, this is a must-visit place you need to try. Highly recommend their noodle soups.

The noodle selection is awesome, with several dishes featuring flavors from across the continent.  The Singapore vermicelli with curry, shrimp, and pork was spectacular.  Located just outside the poker room, with direct access to the casino floor, the Noodle Asia restaurant is also a perfect stop if you are watching a game in the totally amazing newly redesigned sports book.  I shot a quick photo of the orange chicken we had at 1:15am after a fun evening on the town.  Check them out if you can stop by the Venetian.",

Even the dishes that are normally gluten-free, like pho and congee, have gluten here.  According to my server, nothing on the menu was gluten-free.  She gave me something \"special\", which was rice noodles cooked in oil, a few pieces of broccoli and carrots, and boiled chicken with no seasonings (not even salt) and no sauce.  It was bland and unsatisfying and cost $15.  I have been gluten-free for over a decade--since before it was cool.  I am good at avoiding restaurants that won't have options for me.  I can always find something at Asian restaurants.  Until now.  My friend ordered Mongolian Beef and was unimpressed.  Then he felt ill well into the following day.  TL;DR: If you have to avoid gluten, beware that the normal options will not work for you here.",

The food arrived within seven minutes and raised no complaints, at all - just the opposite. The Won Ton was delicious; the Pepper Beef was amazing. The meat was cooked just right and so, so soft, I ate more than I usually do! I deeply appreciate that the food here is not as greasy as that in many other Chinese restaurants I have eaten at.   The decoration of the place and the uniforms of the servers and chefs are distinctly Chinese and add a nice cultural touch to customers' dining experience. The walls of the restaurant are made of glass, so customers can sit down inside and eat while observing sports games on the big screen outside. There are seats positioned facing outward from the restaurant for precisely that purpose. I imagine that is a huge plus for sports enthusiasts.   Our server wasn't too talkactive or smile-y, but he was quick and attentive, which is all I need in a waiter. I always had water in my glass, and we never even had the time to notice the lack of anything before he put it on our table.   Prices are pretty average for a restaurant is on the strip, nothing that should come as a shock to anyone. Many of the meat dishes are served with rice, and the chefs have no issue adjusting the spiciness level for customers.",

The food is actually decent and is probably one of the most authentic Chinese food you can find directly on the strip.  I've only ever ordered one thing: the beef noodle soup. Spicy, flavorful filled with beef & tendon, thin noodles and topped with some green onion and Taiwanese sour cabbage. For $14, it's a major rip off but it definitely hits the spot and it's so good that I can actually finish the whole bowl myself. I tried sharing once and.... let's just say ... THAT was a mistake. I have pretty high standards for beef noodle soup and I definitely like this one.  Speaking of mistakes, don't make this one. As an Asian person, I'm used to ordering a round of water or hot tea for everyone at the table. One time upon ordering tea, the waiter asked me \"how many cups for the tea? \" and I told him \"8, for everyone at the table.\" - also thinking.... don't you just bring a big pot of tea? ANYWAYS well, I was not informed that tea cost like $2-$3 PER CUP PER PERSON. So after he brought 8 cups and only 4 of us actually drank the tea.... but we still got charged for 8 cups of tea! So ridiculous!! Lesson learned.  They've also remodeled since I came last and it looks GREAT! Definitely looks more Vegas and gives a more modern/clean look. Service is ok, could be better.  Sober or drunk.... the beef noodle soup is good. 3.5 stars for good noodles, nice atmosphere and location in the Venetian and... good noodles.",

One friend ordered the wonton soup, which was okay, I'm not really a wonton soup kind of gal but it was the cleanest (sorry there's a word in my culture that I can't find in English that accurately describes the broth ppl that are Taiwanese and Chinese know what I mean). Another friend ordered pai goo noodles, which was pretty good. Another friend order the beef noodle soup and the noodles were good but it's on the spicy side and I think a little less salt would be better. My friend did try to get more soup for her beef noodle soup but they said they were charge just for the soup.  Booo. So we opted out. She also ordered the blacked peppered beef udon, which really aren't really udon noodles, since this place is mainly Chinese influenced food and not really Japanese and that was just okay.  I ordered the Shanghai rice cake dishes, which was good but a little too salty. And another friend ordered the pork and special preserved egg congee, which was good but the pork was also too salty. Since I try not to overeat since I'm an old lady now and don't want tummy issues before bed I didn't puff up the next day. But some of the others gals puffed up a bit from the salt the next day.",

I'd suggest sticking with the soups and noodles.  The other dishes are okay, but not their strong suit, and, as other reviewers have mentioned, priced on the high side.  However, I don't mind paying $10-$12 for a big bowl of great soup in Vegas, whereas I'd be might pissed if I were charged the same in SF.  Be sure to request \"No MSG.\"  They are very accomodating.",

I was brought here by some of my Taiwanese friends on a previous trip and now it's a spot I crave when I'm in Vegas. Whether you're hungover or just plain hungry, the Szechwan Beef noodle soup will deliver. House-made noodles with tender chunks of stewed beef in a delicious broth...you can't go wrong with this one. Their beef rice noodles and their fried rice dishes are an excellent choice as well. My only qualm is with their service which can be pretty horrendous as you'll have to flag your server whether it is for a napkin, more tea, your check, your check to be processed...you get the picture.",

I want to go back again just for this!  YUM!  You definitely won't be disappointed if you get it.  It's a very big portion size (think big big soup bowl) - I think you'd be good if you shared this and then ordered another entree.  Or just eat it on it's own!  The beef and the noodles will help fill you up.  We also ordered fried rice just to mix it up a little and try something else...but it was unremarkable.  My only problem with the restaurant - if you drink the water, you can definitely taste the oils/residue from the other food probably because all the dishes are washed together...GROSS!  I'd bring a separate bottle of water since you'll get thirsty.  :P",

Yes, it costs more since it is in the Venetian but by the time you get in a cab or drive to Chinatown, you have wasted precious time away from strip.   I recommend any of the noodle or rice dishes - big dishes too. What is more impressive is the dim sum. They have it ready to steam and it comes out fresh.

It was busy, so very difficult to get the servers attention- apparently the only way to do this was by holding out our credit card. The sever huffed, took my plate and credit card, and stormed off to show the plate to the manager who literally laughed. They then ran my credit card and had a different person bring back my receipt to avoid speaking to me. I tried to get the manager, but he refused to talk to me as well.  Not even an offer to remake my uneaten food, or at least box it so I could give it to someone more excited to eat mystery meat.   At least an apology or acknowledgement of the mistake would have been nice. It shouldn't be that hard to cook what I order without mixing in pieces of someone else's order. The rude and disrespectful treatment I received is all the convincing I need to not head back to this restaurant.",

There was a long line but it moved very fast.  ++ Really liked the modern Asian decor.   The bad: -- Very few (3 or 4) vegetarian options. -- Quite pricey. 2$ for a teeny bowl of rice.

I loved this entree, however, they discontinued it and it no longer is on the menu.  I am really disappointed about not being able to order it and wish they would start making it again.  It's a really simple dish and all they need is ground beef to be able to make it specially.  I would definitely give them 5 stars if this would be put back on their menu.

Buzzed ass not feeling so good me after Tao Beach: Give me 30 minutes to sleep then I'll get ready for our dinner at Scarpetta.  30 minutes go by...Me: Okay, give me 15 more minutes....another 15 minutes and I'm still sleeping...5 minutes before my dinner reservation, okay, I'll call Scarpetta to cancel, let's just go downstairs to Noodle Asia.     Went downstairs a little after 7 the other Saturday and got a table easily.  I wouldn't say this restaurant is Asian fusion, as it's more \"authentic\" than the likes of let's say PF Changs and Hakasaan, but like I asked the waiter what type of noodles were the beef rice noodles and he said they were like chow fun.  So I dedcied to go with the beef rice noodle but asked for it gravy style instead of the dry version.  I was surprised that they were actually the thinner rice noodle (not super thin like vermicelli, but Chinese chow fun noodles are thicker than the noodles I got).  While the noodles were slightly thinner and the gravy wasn't 100% like what I get back at Chinese restaurants back home, Noodle Asia serves up some good, comforting Asian food.  The quality of the ingredients were a little better than typical Chinese restaurants as well.  The spicy wontons were a favorite and my chow fun was huge enough to serve up to 3 people, or one really hungry friend plus me (he helped me out in addition to his entree).  My \"chow fun\" was $15, which, yes you can get half off off the strip, but, first off, if I couldn't even make it to Cosmo, then there was no way I was going to make it off the strip, and 2 it's expected to be pricier as it's on the Strip.    Service was pretty good, minus a slightly older lady with RBF and major attitude when I asked for change, and for two cards to be charged a certain amount.  3.5 rounded up.",

However, they do know one thing -- this place.  Noodle Asia is located inside the Venetian Hotel in Vegas.  I wouldn't think such a restaurant exists in The Venetian, but you know what; it works!  Noodle Asia reminds me of the 24 hour cafes located in California.  After a night out for drinks you need some grease!  Noodle Asia has all the classic Asian dishes from Shanghai, Black Peppered, Fried Rice, and Dim Sum too!  Needless to say, this place doesn't play around when it comes to Chinese food.  Tab bit overpriced in my opinion for what you get simply because the protein almost drowned out by the carbs.  Granted I enjoy my carbs, just not too much.  Also, is it me or do I need to drink a lot of water after a meal here?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's salty!  Guess that goes well for the \"American\" diet.    There seems to be a line during the day which is not bad.  The restaurant is located right next to the sports betting area so a quick glance over to see the score is awesome. - Enjoy!",

My body was craving for a bowl of instant Shin Ramen (but I didn't want to pay a ridiculous $5 for hot water). Since we stayed at the Palazzo, I agreed with no hesitation with my friend suggested Noodle Asia :)  Service: sloooooow. Tookd them forever to seat us (Okay, maybe not that long, I was just uber hungry and impatient). Took them a while to take our orders and bring water out too even though the place doesn't look too packed.  Food: authentic quality. When the server finally brought the food out. I was like \"Big bowl of delicious hot soup, welcome to my tummy!\" I ordered the Spicy Ying Nan Noodles (4 stars  for taste) and my friends had the HK Wonton soup. They also enjoyed their big bowls of soups a lot. I should have tried a bit for a taste review. The portion was generous. My empty stomach was satisfied to be filled with liquid other than alcohol. Heh heh. The soup was already spicy, but I slapped on more chili to unclog my sinuses.  Overall, the soup made me feel a lot better. Honestly, nothing beats comfort Asian food after all. After digesting that bowl of soup, I was ready to take on another day at Sin City. Why the 3 stars then? Because the poor college student in me is very bitter at paying 2 times the prices of what the bowl of soup really is worth...",

The soup is full of flavor, the meat is tender and melts in your mouth and the only complaint I have is that I always want more.....more noodles...more meat....larger bowl. What can I say, I love noodles.  Place is great to eat at since it's open until 3am, so if you don't feel like eating at Grand Lux cafe and are staying at Venetian or Palazzo, walk on over to Noodle Asia and order a bowl.   Is it the best beef noodle soup....no, you can only find the best in Taiwan...however it'll take care of your cravings while in Las Vegas",

Not bad if you're trying to recover from a night (or day of drinking).  For the other night I visited, I ordered their BBQ duck, chicken and pork. This is a $30 dish and it is only meat. No rice. No Chinese scallion & ginger oil sauce which is standard for a dish like this. I thought they had forgot it and asked for it under the assumption that they had just forgot it. Our server looked puzzled, spoke to a manager, ran to the back with a saucer, came out empty handed and told me that they did not have any. This was disappointing.   I think we do have to remember that this is a casino in the middle of the desert and we should manage our expectations. Is it good for an Asian restaurant in a Las Vegas casino? Yes. Will you be disappointed? Only if you anticipate authentic dishes.   I would go back again, but would steer clear of the BBQ plate since it's relatively expensive compared to the other items. There was very little char siu and of course, the absence of a crucial condiment.",

The hostesses didnt ask how many was in my party and just ushered me to any seat. I didnt know she was seating me until she flagged me down, but no talking. Second, there was a little bug in my water. I told the staff and they didn't say anything, just walked away. Third, whenever I flagged them down, they would ignore me and attend someone else who flagged them down AFTER me. The only reason why I'm giving them a 1 star is honestly because I can't give zero stars. Also, food was just okay. Nothing special. Yheres better food on the strip. Don't waste your time and money here.",

Reminded me of beef hand pulled noodle I got in nyc but that was better. Beef chow fun - like any other fast food Chinese food, so if you're looking for something unique skip it, but I liked it.  Chinese broccoli  - average so I'd order another veggie dish BBQ combo - variety of meat offered but a bit pricey  Other nuances of the night: Service is slow. Can't get a refill in tea and can't get extra plates to share without waiting. You have to pay $2 for a cup of rice and  $4.50 for the tea pot (you can refill for as much as you like). This place wasn't amazing but filled my hungry stomach.",

Honestly a lot of noise so if you were expecting a quiet dinner then this is not he place. Also you can see everything outside so it's alright.   Wait time is little to nothing to get seated and also the food gets prepped fast. So if you're really hungry go there you'll be happy.   The food is good. If you're big on iced tea and boba they got it so that'll make you happy.   The food is my gripe. So it's not terribly expensive compared to other things on the strip but the meat had tons of bone which made the food look bigger even though it wasn't. Also, if you're not a fan of salt beware the broth is salty along with a lot of their foods but other than that it was a pleasant experience and I enjoyed the food.",

I started with the Vietnamese coffee. Omggg amazing!  For a starter, I went with the potstickers. The sauce that is served with them.... out of this world!!! The pot stickers where perfectly cooked and huge in size. The meat inside was seasoned perfectly. For entree, I ordered the szechwan beef noodle soup. I am soooo happy I listened to the other yelpers for this item. Delicious broth, perfectly cooked beef and just a bowl of happiness. The flavor was unlike any noodle soup I have ever had. My total cost for the meal was $40.   Definitely worth checking out if you are staying at the Venetian!",

Something that stood out to me was the fact that the management, thanked me and my friend not once but twice for waiting to be seated. Granted we only waited about 20 minutes, it felt nice to hear the management care about the wait.  Onto the food...  The Dan Dan Noodles were well worth the wait too! I opted to get the Pork out of the dish and was happy. This bowl of noodles with some peanut butter, and spices, and broth was extremely filling. I almost slurpped out what was in the bowl!  The thai iced tea was perfect, very sweet! and the spring rolls were okay, to be honest nothing to rave about, but they were a very big serving.   My downfall about Noodle Asia is the location. It's inside the casino, on the bottom floor, but its a bit of a maze to get to. Plus side--the bathrooms are 5 feet away!",

We were running late and I took my luggage with me so that I could head straight to the airport after lunch.  We were seated right away and the two of us each got our own bowl of beef noodle soup and we shared an order of Cantonese roast duck.  The noodles were so satisfying. The soup had a good amount of flavor and the noodles had an excellent chewy texture. Have I had better beef noodle soups before? Absolutely but this was very solid.  I'm glad we tried the duck and it was ok. It was nice to have something else to munch on besides the noodles.",

    "text": "Yes, the food is delicious. Yes, the pot stickers were some of the best the I have ever had the opportunity to enjoy. So why not five stars? The service -- now on multiple occasions -- has been so bad, I had to take off one star. But imagine how good it is if I'm giving four stars for some of the worst service I've ever experienced!  Yes, it really is that good.  The funny story in all of this is that my wife and I were just wandering around looking for some breakfast on a lazy Saturday morning. Heavy breakfast at the Grand Lux? No thanks. Walk down to White Castle? Too far and too lazy. Then we saw the sign for Noodle Asia and thought that the idea of fried rice and pot stickers for breakfast sounded great! But when we walked up to the restaurant, we found out that it didn't open until 11 a.m. It was 10:30. So we sat down at a slot, lost $40, and then jumped up as others appeared ready to go to Noodle Asia.  First in line, we were ready to eat. We were seated. And then...nothing. Others had their orders taken but we just sat. And sat. And sat. As food started coming out for others, our order was finally taken, just seconds before we were going to get up and leave. Then others were seated, their orders were taken, and their food was served. We still had nothing.  It wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't had two cups of hot and sour soup. How hard would it be to simply ladle the soup into a cup and bring it to us?  The problem is that this isn't the first time we have received this treatment at Noodle Asia. On our previous trip to Las Vegas, we had another situation in which we were seated, and after 20 minutes, we got up and left. We actually asked two servers if our order could be taken and they said that they would be right back. But still, nothing.  Once the food arrived, however, it was all worth it. The hot and sour soup was, well, hot AND sour. What a concept! We also ordered the Night Market Fried Rice, which was a fried rice with sliced beef, Thai chilies, bean sprouts, basil, and diced tomatoes. Don't believe the menu that claims that this rice is spicy, but it is incredibly flavorful. The basil flavor lingers throughout each bite and the sliced beef is tender and delicious.  The Pot Stickers were the clear winner of the day. The dough is not that super-thin, frozen pot sticker style. Instead, it is thicker, creating a great crust where it was pan fried, but leaving a nice bite through the rest of the dough. The pork inside has a wonderfully light ginger flavor. I added a touch of what appeared to simply be soy sauce with green onions as well as some chili paste to give it a little kick. The result was a flavor explosion in my mouth that I have never tasted before. These are a must order.  We also tried the Red Won Tons, which were not quite as successful. These, which were also listed as spicy on the menu but were not, had pork fillings and were tossed in Szechwan Hung Yao chili and presented in garlic sauce. The pork tasted similar to the pork in the pot stickers, but the garlic sauce was incredibly oily and tasted almost burned, ending with an unpleasant texture and taste in my mouth.  But it was well worth it. And that was just the basics. I can't wait to get back and try some more!",

During my week stay in Vegas I came on three occasions and everything was pretty good, at least better than I expected. I was ample to try the shui mai, wonton noodle soup, sweet and sour pork, and the Mongolian beef. My favs were the wonton noodle soup and the Mongolian beef. The shui mai were too salty and the sweet and sour pork was fried in too much flour with too much vinegar in the sauce. Also, keep in mind that this is Vegas so expect a 15-20 percent increase in prices. Overall, if you are in Vegas and craving for some decent Chinese food, I can recommend Noodle Asia.",

    "text": "My cousin practically lives in Vegas and he highly recommended me to eat the Won Ton Mein here. It's like his go to dish so I made sure to eat here during my trip. I arrived a little after 7pm and the place wasn't very busy. The service was initially attentive and the workers spoke Chinese very politely to me. They gave me the option to get the dimsum the same time as my noodle dishes or as an appetizer. I chose it as an appetizer. This was a nice option to have but I wish I got all the food the same time because it got busy and it took awhile to get my noodle dishes. Service also wasn't that great toward the end of my meal so this place is more a 3.5 spot.   It's not often I come to Vegas anymore so I ordered up a feast. I got their Har Gow, Hong Kong Won Ton (Mein), Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup and some hot tea. Hot tea is not free!! I'm Chinese so paying for hot tea at a Chinese restaurant is foreign to me.   Food:  The Har Gow was very good and went great with their chili oil (you need to ask for this item, it's not on the table as a condiment). Har Gow was large and was easy to pick up without it falling apart. The shrimp was fresh and sweet.   Hong Kong Won Ton was just as my cousin described. It's really good and the won tons actually had meat inside vs just fat and filler. Soup was like Hong Kong broth and there was just the right amount of noodles. (Add the chili oil if you like spice, it was sooooo good!)  The Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup was good but my least favorite. It was the dish that I left unfinished. The broth had good flavor and had a slight kick to it. Noodles and beef were ok but nice option for noodles here. Portions were generous but broth could have been hotter (temperature wise).",

I had the Szechuan beef noodle soup after reading many positive reviews - it definitely helped soothe my hangover, but it wasn't outstanding either. The beef was incredibly tender, but I felt like they could've used a more fragrant spice, rather than simply pouring in a lot of red oil. We also ordered a plate of BBQ pork for the table to share, which was not bad although a bit bland in my opinion.   Service was average as well; my friend's cup was dirty and it took quite a long time for them to return with a new one and they only came around to refill water once. Considering the portion size, the price was not bad, but I would recommend making the trip to Spring Mountain Rd if you want a more satisfying Asian meal.",

The reason why I'm giving only 3 stars is because the service was really bad. The moment we sat down, we already knew what we wanted, so we ordered the beef noodle soup with extra noodles and the Buddah feast.   When the noodles came, the beef noodle soup didnt have extra noodles so I called a waiter to double check if the extra noodles were coming. About 10 mins later, another waiter came and asked if everything was okay. \"No, it wasn't. Where's my noodles?\" They went back to check on the noodles only to find it not put in to the system again. The waiter asked another waiter and then they finally came to double check on my order and write that s*** down. At this point the noodles in the original bowl already soaked up all the soup so we also asked for extra soup.   The noodles finally came out but with no soup. I gave up at this point lol. The stir fry string beans with basil is really good! The roast bbq duck was so tender and the skin was still crispy!   It's okay, I will always have this place in my heart. I love you Venetian noodles! Just have better service",

But then, the mix of dishes they have (hence the Asia in the name, as opposed to China), make it so that they do a lot of things decently, but seemingly none of them super well.  (You know, jack of all trades, master of none, kinda thing).    Being a white girl (and a pale, blonde white girl at that), I feel I have to hyperbolically express how spicy I would like dishes at Asian restaurants, so that they're the normal spice of Asian restaurants. I asked our server if the Ma Po Tofu (very authentic dish I love) is spicy.  She said she didn't know as she doesn't like spicy dishes. It was not spicy, it lacked the Ma La the it should have, and it was fairly bland. Disappointed. The only 'spicy sauce they have if you ask for any is chili oil.   I'm hoping that Jim G no longer wants to curb his late-night cravings here, as it's just not nearly as good as it smells (but it smells delicious!!!)",

I'm vegan and I ordered the mixed vegetable noodle soup and asked if they could make the broth vegetarian and they said yes. The \"broth\" was literally the water they cooked the noodles in, no flavor whatsoever and it was $15! Way overpriced. My sister ordered her meal to go, we waited 30-45 minutes until we asked if it was still coming, the waitress assured us it was on it's way out. We then saw her put the order in right after we asked about it because it seems that she had forgotten about that part of our order. Only giving two stars because I know its hard to accommodate a vegetarian diet and they tried but failed miserably.",

It is also super popular with all the Asian customers at the hotel which are a lot. There is a long line at opening time so the only time I've eaten here is off peak hours. Ok now about the food. The food is really good. Everything I've eaten here is good, borderline great.  This time I ate the paigoo ( boiled pork chop) noodle soup and the wok cooked steak and basil with tomato fried rice. They were both great and delicious and I devoured it all. They charge a lot for tea but the tea is good and it's a perfect compliment to the food which is a little oily. The prices are expensive but it's located in Venetian and if you gamble and room charge you can probably get the charges comped.",

We skipped the line and ordered via phone. They say they'll call you when it's ready.  But when I checked in 15 minutes, they already had it done! Love it. I'll order to-go again! I had the Singapore noodles. Pretty on par with what I thought it would be.   I actually sat down at the restaurant later in the week.  I gotta say..as an Asian used to Asian service, the customer service is standard for an Asian restaurant. It seems gruff for a Vegas location, but just right for an Asian noodle house. They sit you down, take your order, bring you food, and take your money. That's it. No more, no less. They were so busy during the show.   My friend is on a gluten free regime. She said the beef rice noodles were great!",

There I was, laying in my las vegas suite thinking I need some hot noodle soup for this slight hangover...Scrolling through restaurants on Yelp went from seconds, to minutes, to almost an hour!  Then my gf had mentioned this awesome noodle house located in the Venitian hotel.   I was so happy that we had a place to go to fulfill my craving. This place really does the job.   A few things to try -   -chinese broccoli  -roasted duck -Won ton noodle soup (yellow egg noodles) -Pho (rice noodles) -Roasted duck noodle soup (yellow egg noodles) -Spicy seafood soup (thin udon noodles)  Everything tasted really good. No complaints. The hot soup and broth in my belly satisfied my needs.   The only issue was that we had to ask 10x for some lemons....",

    "text": "Yes, everything is overpriced but what restaurant on the Strip inside a five star hotel/casino isn't?  Unless you are getting a comped meal, you just expect to be gouged.  So, I will just focus on other aspects.  It's a great place for a quick casual meal or late night snack.  I am not Cantonese so, I can't speculate on how authentic it is but here is what I do when I am eating at an ethnic place.  Who works there?  All Chinese, check.  Who are the cooks?  All look like seasoned veterans, check.  Who eats there?  Many Asians, check.  Passes my test for authenticity.  It's a functional place with some counter space next to the open kitchen and utilitarian tables. Service can be uneven.  I have read other reviews about service neglect but personally I have not experienced what I would consider service neglect in more than half a dozen visit.  Appetizers are overpriced, (I know I said I would try to not to mention price) especially dim sum stuff.  I still love the potstickers.  Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce makes it a nice vegetable side dish.  Hot and sour soup definitely hits the spot every time.  Love the buddha feast pan-toasted noodles and mixed seafood pan toasted noodles.  Both come with generous serving of either vegetarian stuff or seafood.  Overall, while expensive, it's as close to real Chinatown as it gets on the Strip.",

They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O.   I came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area.   My server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the \"Pho Prime\".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)  The Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...  Overall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.  I left fulfilled and satisfied that I got my Pho ;)",

However the female manager who came by to serve our food was very pleasant, and indeed a cutie with a twinkle in her winkle lol.....  I had the night market fried rice 4/5: sliced beef tossed in thai chilli, basil, bean sprouts, and diced tomatos was yumm!! perfect balance of flavors, however the beef slices could have been smaller.  Each slice was half a mouthful lol...  BBQ Pork & Duck Noodle Soup 2/5: Barely any duck, and a few slices of bbq pork, the presentation was great, but honestly not worth it.  Fu Chow Fried Rice 3/5: presentation, taste, and portion was bang on! lots of shrimp, chicken, mushroom, calamari, and scallion gravy...worth it!!  Overall the quality of the dishes were below my expectations.  This restaurant almost seemed like a waste of space that lacked the taste. Sorry Venetian",

We ordered char siu won ton mein - Won ton soup w/ BBQ pork, won ton and noodles.  We wanted duck, char siu and won tons, but they ran out of duck.  The basic soup is $11.95, with a $4 extra charge for won tons.  The soup also comes w/ a little bit of gai lan (chinese broccoli).  The soup was OK.  The broth was a little weak, and the noodles were not that great.  However, after two days of eating American and French food, I needed my Azn fix.  The won ton were OK, but $4 extra for 4 won tons is a little steep.  The ambiance is sterile and the service was OK.  I would come here again for an early am fix.  Yes the food is 2X overpriced, but the rent is high and the convenience of 24 hour place in the Venetian is hard to beat.",

We were worried that our food would take a while to come out since there were so many tables in front of us that haven't gotten their food. However, our entrees came out super fast! The food was piping hot and you can tell it just came off the grill.  But the quality? Definitely not authentic-tasting and lacked flavor. You can always add soy sauce to make it more satisfying. I think the food came off the grill a little TOO soon, almost like the chefs rush through all of their orders and don't have time to season the dishes more carefully.  Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really hungry and don't mind fishing out extra money to eat sub-par Chinese food.",

The Nightmarket Fried Rice will cut deep into your wallet at $14.95 for a simple plate of fried rice. But it's GOOD!  Some recommendations Seafood Noodle ($16.50), Black Pepper Beef Udon ($14.95), and Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup (13.95) - super spicy!  The service staff is attentive and as quick as possible.  I went late night around 3:30 am and they wanted to leave for the night but let me get my order in and was entirely accommodating.  It's definitely one of those places that you want to make sure you get to go to every time you're in Vegas :)",

    "text": "2.5 STARS...  Living in SF all my life and being such a close proximity to a variety of Asian restaurants made me forgot that people in other areas aren't that fortunate. I've come to the conclusion that there is no good AUTHENTIC Asian food on the strip...even if the people cooking it ARE Asian! Ya, GO FIGURE! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE all types of cuisines, but after countless nights of drinking, the best hangover cure is jook, noodle soup, or any type of carbs for that matter!   After the most wildest drunken night at XS, all we wanted was ASIAN comfort food without having to trek outta of the strip. We came across Noodle Asia in the Venetian/Palazzo Directory; it had \"Noodles\" in it's title, so it was a go!  Normally, you get free tea with your meal at Asian restaurants, but Noodles Asia charges $3.50. It's Vegas afterall, so I digress.  We started with the Jellyfish Salad ($10.95). What we got was a a glob of red-colored jelly fish on a 4-inch diameter plate. The jellyfish had a weird texture...actually it had no texture at all. It tasted like it had been marinating in a bag of chili oil. You know, one of those jellyfish packets you get at an Asian Market for 99 cents?  I ordered the \"Beef Noodles\" which was technically Beef Chow Fun ($12.95).  Ok, why not just call it that? It was very meh, the noodles  looked mushed together b/c they were over-cooked. And, I thought chow fun was suppose to be flat-WIDE noodles? Ummm, at least they were generous with the beef....  Service: Ahhhh, even though you're paying 2-3x more for the food here, the service NO different than any other hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. As in, you just get your food fast and then get ignored.   Other than convenience and the fact I was CRAVING Asian food badly, I can't imagine making a point to come back here. But hey, when you're hungry AND hungover, just about anything would do...",

Glistening, fatty duck and lean slices of BBQ pork floating among baby bok choy over thin egg noodles.  Clean, clear, deep-colored broth...not the oily kind commonly found in your average Chinese restaurant.  I enjoyed every slurp, every morsel.

The soups and the dishes definitely have an authenticity to it that make it feel like you're dining at a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in LA, NY, or San Francisco. But once you look at the prices and hear the sounds of slot machines start going off in the distance, you quickly realize that the Chinese restaurant you drunkenly stumbled your way into is inside the Venetian, on the Las Vegas Strip.  Though the prices do suck, the food is definitely well worth it and should help sober you up, if you've had one too much to drink. The service can be hit or miss, and luckily for me, the service has been ok each time I've visited here.",

BBQ pork and roast duck (noodle soup) $19.95  3.  Beef rice noodles (wok-tossed noodle) $14.95 4.  Singapore mei fun (wok-tossed noodle) $13.95  we expected the worst, and were pleasantly surprised.  the dishes are all very large, so its best to share/eat family style.  the noodles soups were tasty, with generous porions of BBQ pork and duck pieces.  the wok-tossed noodles were surprisingly authentic-- the Beef rice noodles had a good flavor and the noodles were long and intact, and the pieces of beef were very large.  the singapore noodles were had just the right spice.     can't vouch for the other foodstuffs, but what i had was good and i would go again.  cost is reasonable for the area and the convenience if you're already at The Venetian.",

Yes, it is expensive, but really a good choice if you don't want to venture very far from the casino or from your hotel and have a craving for some good Chinese. Because most of the dishes are family style, this is great for groups.",

We asked the waitress to check our food and we still had to wait for another 15mins. Finally my food came out and before I even finished, waitress came by and gave us the check and asked me if i need a box for my food when I'm not even done eating so I thought that was pretty rude.

After all,  I am Asian and had only the best Asian food.    Still,  it's hard to give them a better rating when a simple standard dish such as Mapo tofu and Hot and sour soup was horrid.  Soup was overly sour and the Mapo tofu had no taste.   It just tasted like tofu with cornstarch cooked into it.  No flavor.  None.  Maybe some salt?   The crispy noodles and Mongolian beef was decent.   I added an extra star because these two dishes were borderline food court level.   The shu mai dimsum appetizer was also decent but nothing special.  $9 for 6 pieces.    Every dish was around $15+ but that's because it's inside a hotel.   All the cooks and servers were Asian.  Service was Asian like.   That means it was below average.   Don't expect superb food,  ambience or service here.

    "text": "After days and days of burgers in Las Vegas, we were a bit tired of it and wanted something Asian (we actually missed Asian food soo sooo much!!)  We came across this restaurant by accident but when my parents' friends saw it, they immediately decided to have dinner there. They said they really wanted a hot bowl of noodle soup. There wasn't a lineup so we got seated really quickly. It took them a while to bring us tea. In fact, my dad had to ask the waiter for it. I wouldn't say the waiter was super friendly and attentive. While he was taking our orders, he was just looking at other tables, which I find was unprofessional.  The menu has a big variety of dishes ranging from congee to noodle soup, from fried rice to dim sum, etc. It took me a little while to decide what I wanted because there were a lot of dishes that I like. I finally decided to try their Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup (). My sister ordered their Fish Filet congee () because she wasn't feeling well and congee is easier to digest. My mom ordered their Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup (). My dad and my parents' friends all opted for their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (). I wanted to order the beef noodle soup but I was scared it would be too spicy so I didn't get it. My Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup () came with wonton noodles (also called wanton mee). Some people, like my mom, dislike the flavor of this kind of noodle but I'm fine with it. I liked how the texture of this noodle is firmer and thus, chewier. The dish came with only 2 baby bok choy... I definitely would enjoy more vegetables here. The beef stew was flavorful but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I didn't like the fact that half of my portion of meat was just fat. I was expecting more tendons and meat for the price I paid (pay $15 USD). They also cut the meat in small pieces, which made it seem like there were a lot of mean in this bowl.   My sister's Fish Filet congee () congee was pretty good but definitely not worth the price considering the amount of fish filet she had. It was just a decent bowl of congee but nothing too special about it.  My mom's Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup () was.... I don't even know how to describe it. It definitely didn't look like what she had imagine! It looked really messy with enoki and cabbage all spread out and floating around... It originally came with wonton noodles but since my mom doesn't like this kind of noodle, she exchanged it for Lai Fun (). This bowl of noodle soup didn't taste bad but definitely not worth its price considering there wasn't a piece of meat and all the ingredients are not expensive at all...  It seems like their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup () is a must there but you will be quite disappointed, especially if you've had the beef noodle soup from Asia or Taiwan before! It is just not comparable!! It was tasteful but still lacking flavor as compared to any of the beef noodle soup restaurants in Taiwan. I highly suggest anyone to visit Taiwan because this country is a food heaven!  In short, there aren't many Asian restaurants on Las Vegas Strip, if you are tired of Panda Express and would like something classier (conveniently located inside The Venetian Hotel, on the same level as their casino and beautifully decorated) and more expensive, Noodle Asia is the place to go! I don't think the price justified the quantity and quality of their food but it was nonetheless a satisfying meal for us.",

The BBQ Pork and the Roast Duck were so yummy. The egg rolls were just okay, nothing out of the ordinary.  I will definitely be eating here again. I mean, you know the place is good when you go to an Asian restaurant and all you see are Asians eating there.",

I sat down, table for one (sigh) and ordered the BBQ pork and Roast Duck Noodle Soup and a nice, big, free glass of water and watched the World Cup on the big screens in the sports betting pit.  The water was worth every penny.  So was the soup!  By the time I left Noodle Asia, the bowl looked much like my wallet: bereft of anything holding value.  Will definitely do this again, but I seriously hope I don't do what preceded this meal again.  But I know I will.",

It doesn't really Americanize the food the way many of the other nice casino Chinese places do.  The snow cabbage noodle is pretty good. The sichuan beef noodle is excellent -- very spicy but also quite authentic. The bbq pork and duck on rice is great though on the salty/saucy side of things.  Price is a tad higher than what you'd pay in the suburbs of most Chinese-populated areas but hey, it's Vegas and in a casino so overall I was pretty happy with the value.",

The menu mostly consists of noodle soups, stir fried noodles and fried rice. Besides that, they have less than 10 main dishes to choose from, and it's pretty much only the standard things my white friends always order - beef/chic broccoli, orange beef/chic, mongolian beef, etc.   We did a bunch of stuff for 6 family style. Things that were good: nothing. Things that were decent: fried rice, hot braised shrimp (aka sweet sour shrimp), siu mai. Things that were crap - everything else we ordered. Pass on the following: pot stickers, beef curry stew, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, orange chicken, egg roll/spring rolls. Food was bland, and nothing \"spicy\" actually was despite the presence of chili peppers.  If you insist on staying here to have asian food, you can probably get comparable quality stuff for less from the panda express type place at the food court - think it's called wasabi jane?  It probably even includes mediocre fried rice and a stale egg roll with your meal. Or if you want a sit down experience, Zine at Palazzo is priced slightly more, but with a much better menu. I'm not a huge fan of their food either, but if you really must do overpriced chinese food at this hotel, Zine is the one to go for.   An asian food court is supposed to open at Palazzo off the casino floor eventually, so it's nice to know there are potentially better options coming soon.",

Having eaten in Hong Kong and Singapore at some of the best restaurants there, I would say that the chefs here are among the top chefs.  Try their beef noodle soup, this place makes the best beef noodle soup.  Sometimes it is a bit salty, just add a little red vinegar and it will taste better.  I would recommend you try the spicy wonton appetizer, Mongolian beef and scallion, wonton noodle soup (pay an extra $9-$10 to add the BBQ pork).  If you are vegetarian, try their stir fried string bean.   It is pricey, but don't forget that you are in Vegas.  $10 may not be enough for one hand of Black Jack, but it can buy you a good bowl of noodle.",

It's inside of the Venetian (in the casino by the slot machines) so it's worth it if you're really craving a quick bowl of noodle soup and don't want to make the trip to Chinatown. It's a little pricey-the noodle soups will run you about $15 per bowl, but you're paying for the convenience of the location. Ambiance is nice and casual. It's open to the casino and you can see/hear the slot machines going.  Food: It's okay, nothing spectacular. Been here a bunch of times and always get the same dishes: wonton noodle soup, Cantonese beef stew, veggies. Usually everything tastes fine, but on this last visit the broths were very bland, almost tasteless.  Service: Surprisingly subpar for a restaurant located inside of the Venetian. In the past it's been quick and decent, so maybe they were just having an off day. I can certainly understand service being a little slow when it's super busy. But this last visit to Noodle Asia was not during a rush, maybe about 8 tables were full. Service was very very slow. Asked for some extra chopsticks and had a pair LITERALLY thrown onto the table by the waiter who couldn't bother to walk an extra foot. Getting the bill was also an endeavor and took probably 15 minutes. The other tables were experiencing the same frustration too, I could hear the table next to us loudly complaining about how long it was taking.  I'm sure we'll be back though because it's convenient. Hopefully food and service will be better next time.",

After a long night of drinking and partying with my group of friends at TAO, we stopped by here to grab food. I ordered a Spicy Ying Nan Noodle soup bowl which consisted of vermicelli and shrimp enveloped in a scrumptuous chicken broth with Ying Nan chili paste, scallions and cilantro. The broth was fresh, and overall, it wasn't too spicy. The noodles were smooth and tasted great when they slid down my alcohol ravaged throat. Although the dish was slightly overpriced at $14, it tasted good and believe it or not, I would come back again to try out some of the other dishes!  This place is good for large groups and it is an excellent choice if you happen to be staying at the Venentian.",

    "text": "Came here when I was in Vegas, was pretty disappointing to be honest. All the reviews said \"authentic Chinese food\" and \"best Chinese food on the strip\" and all I remember was how disappointing it was.  First off, the location is near the betting areas so I guess you get to watch some sports while waiting in line. The problem is you'll be waiting in line for a long time, at least for lunch. We waited nearly an hour to get in and then another hour to finally get our food.  I ordered the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup based on everyone's reviews. They made it seem like it was amazing but it was just... okay. The soup was strong in flavor, but the noodles were ordinary and the meat was tender yet bland.  Overall, it was pretty average. The food was decent, but the wait really ruined it for me.",

    "text": "Pretty good Chinese place for Vegas. We wanted to get an inexpensive but good meal and decided to give this place a try. It's located right in the middle of the casino, which was interesting. Saw lots of Asian patrons so that made me feel better! Haha  Food comes out super fast.  Ordered the curry noodles with bbq pork and shrimp, it was DELICIOUS! Portion size was good for $13 bucks. Also ordered a glass of chardonnay for $7. My friend got a beer and the crispy pan fried noodles.  Overall a great place for a quick bite that won't break your wallet.",
