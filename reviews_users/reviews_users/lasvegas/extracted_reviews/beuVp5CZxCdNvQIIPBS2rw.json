I have been here 4-5 times, every time I have had a pleasant experience. The only issue is that this place is completely overpriced for the amount of vegetables and add ons. The meat quality was soso, and the broth wasn't spectacular. I recently tried the tomato broth and I do recommend that over all the other broths. Also, I would recommend trying the side dishes they have at the sauce table. There was lotus root one time when I went and it was delicious. Another time there was this wood mushrooms. Overall, I would give Chubby Cattle 3/5. It is though the better hotpot places in Vegas.",

    "text": "This was our first time at a Hot Pot restaurant! I was excited when we sat down because the conveyer belt reminded me of some restaurants in Japan and Hawaii! I was also excited that there was an option of soup base that didn't have nightshades! (since I'm allergic to nightshades; potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants) I chose the mushroom soup and my husband chose the ox tail soup...which looked delicious!! If they didn't have pepper in the broth...that would've been my choice as well! BUT...my broth was just as delicious and I was very pleased with it! We also ordered the meat combo and lamb skewers. The lamb skewers came out with dried crushed pepper flakes which wasn't mentioned on the menu, so we ordered another one without the dusted peppered lamb and I LOVED it! I could eat the entire skewer plate....and I did! Lol since we had two orders of lamb now, my hubs ate the peppered one and I ate the non peppered one.  When our soups came, we waited for them to start boiling and began making our dips and extra seasonings for our broth. I chose to add fresh garlic, cilantro, sesame oil, green onions and salt into my bowl. This mixture ended up into my soup and my broth was even more to my liking. I couldn't tell you how much in love I am with this place!!  I was also exited about the chayote they had on the conveyor belt. I only eat that stuff when my dad makes it in his delicious Filipino soup called Tinola. But I decided to put it in my hot pot that night and I loved it as equally as I did when my dad makes it! I love this place and I wish it was here in Maryland.",

Food quality was good and the plates on the conveyor seemed to be rotated fairly regularly.    their \"original\" broth is flavorful and their \"hell\" broths are great!  All in all, a great restaurant in terms of the food.  Minus the one star because the server we had spoke too quickly, mumbled a lot, and called us (4 guys in the party), all \"bro\".  A lot.  like every few words.  Listen, I'm not your \"bro\".  Until I spoke Chinese to the waiter (towards the end of the meal), he did not seem too keen on offering good service.  I hope they address this training issue.  Food food, it's 5 stars. For service, it's a 4.  I'd definitely go back again.",

Our waters, soups and bellys were never empty =) we were also seated in a timely manner, although it was very busy.

The sauce bar is a delectable self-serve counter where you can choose from several sauces, including black bean sauce, fried garlic, house sauce, sesame oil, peanut sauce, etc. You can choose to dip, mix and eat your food with any number of sauces. Awesome, right? The food on the conveyor belt was fresh and didn't smell, due to the high turnover rate of customers. I enjoyed my meal and so did my boyfriend.

    "text": "My friend is a hot pot fanatic so I did quite a bit of searching on yelp to find a good spot to have dinner for the both of us. The food and experience here was enjoyable. Service was nice. The conveyer belt is a great idea since I prefer only eating certain sides, I can pick and choose however I please. Their sauce bar had hot cheetos, which was a plus for me. I thought it was very sincere of our waitress to warn my friend that the spiciest broth was very strong. However, don't doubt my friend, she'll drop 10 more hot drops if she has to. When the broth came out, it wasn't spicy enough for her so she was disappointed with the hype. She liked the flavor nonetheless. The only thing that made her lose her appetite was the sour peppers she kept biting into in the broth. She recommends the kitchen puts the spices in a spice bag.  If there is one thing that irked me about this place was that I did my research online before I came and the price for the Kobe was $25.99 for a 3 oz, $49.99 for a 6oz. The 3 oz was what we ordered. It was the only meat that doesn't state the price on the actual menu which seemed kind of sketch because it seems like they could just decide however much it could be at that point. I was too trustworthy. They charged me $50 for this and when I asked, they said the 3oz was for $50 and the 6 oz was for $100. I felt cheated and super annoyed. I probably should have brought up their menu online to confront them about it. I didn't want to ruin my experience here though by bringing up conflicts considering it was my friend's and my first time here and we did like it a lot... except for the sketchiness. Next time if I decide to come here, assuming I'll get over this situation, I'll ask for their prices first before I order.",

It's not always fresh so be careful. Better bet is to order from the menu. Service here is a bit volatile but they generally try to provide great service. I remember James was our server twice and is super nice and attentive. There were a few others that were nice but not as memorable.",

    "text": "I've been to Chubby Cattle quite a few times now. It's my go-to spot for hot pot. They used to have a casino and student discount on Sundays and Wednesdays where it's BOGO free. However, they have now changed that. Instead of BOGO free, you sign up for a pre-paid card (much like a gift card) and you get an additional amount of $$$ (I've attached a pic). So if you place $100 on the card, you get an extra $18; purchase $200 and you get additional $38, and so on.   The broth is what keeps me coming back. I've had the tomato, original, oxtail, and spicy pot. Only one I haven't tried is the mushroom. My top 2 is the tomato and original. I also recommend the beef combo, and the juicy beef balls. The beef balls are filled with soup in the middle so be careful and make sure you don't chomp down on the whole thing! It burns! I speak from experience.   They also have a wonderful sauce bar where you can make your own sauce for you to dip your food in. If you look at the top of the sauce bar, there are signs that'll give you samples of what sauces to mix to go with whatever meat you're having (great for people who are kitchen-challenged, such as myself).  I do enjoy the conveyor belt and it's fun to pick the food you want from it. If you're at a table that isn't connected to the conveyor belt, you can always order from the menu bc it's the same items.   The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars for me is the service. I always have to ask for a water refill and that's a pet peeve of mine. Or there will be silverware missing and it takes them forever and a half years to get the items to you.   Even with that said, I will still go back to Chubby because I truly do enjoy the food.",

    "text": "Really overpriced.  The food isn't bad.  This review isn't about the food but the selection and what you get for the $$$.  So if you've never had hot pot style cuisine, yes, this would be an good experience.  Touristy kind of vibe here and you don't get much food for the amount.  Usually there's stuff provided like veggies as a filler.  Or there's all you can eat places that has crabs, roes, shrimp, all sorts of seafood, tofu stuffed items, all sorts of beef, etc.  While here, my gf and I ordered a 13 oz beef plate, a veggie plate (which was just a basket of veggie, no tofu, no mushroom, no variety of anything) and some noodles here for 60.  I just wanted to come here to see what the rave was all about.",

    "text": "First off, I'm super impressed by this entire Asian food plaza. It has all the popular restaurants on Mountain Spring Road. From fancy Vietnamese food to sushi, and now Mongolian Hot Pot, Vegas' Asian food scene is so hot RIGHT NOW.  I came to Chubby Cattle right at noon on Sunday morning and people were waiting to be seated. I had no idea this restaurant was featured on the Food Network, so I noticed the TV hype as patrons mentioned they wanted to try this place due to ZimmernList.   We wanted to order the Wagyu (which they advertised on Yelp too), but they were sold out. So we ordered the Beef combo with a veggie platter. The veggie platter came out in 30 minutes (it's raw veggies, we cook it ourselves, c'mon) and our beef came out 1 hour later (again, it's raw. we would have to cook it ourselves).   The veggie platter came in a large wooden basket with a variety of vegetables but what I didn't understand was the romaine lettuce. I get bok choy and cabbage, but I don't get why you would cook lettuce in broth. It's just weird.   The beef combo was actually pretty decent once it came out and the meat was nicely marbled.  There is a rotating conveyor belt (like a sushi belt) of toppings that you can choose from for your hot pot. All the toppings were not labeled nor did the ingredients looked very appetizing. The rotating plates were color coordinated to different pricing, so we got the price but the frosty covers don't reveal much.  At the sauce station, the variety of sauces was nice, but there are a million signs of how to develop \"recommended\" sauce combinations.   All in all.. there is WAYYY too much going on here. The gimmick of these random features fall short.  I think Chubby Cattle should just concentrate on executing good quality meats/veggies in a timely manner. The entire restaurant was not pleased with the slow pacing of the food coming out (our server was pleasant, at least!).  Interesting experience but probably never would be back.",

    "text": "My favorite hotpot place in town. To me, hotpot is foremost  about how great the broth is and Chubby Cattle's medium spicy hellish broth keeps me coming back and back for more. There's also other broths you can pick from, with a variety of spice levels, from no spiciness all the way to hottest hellish. The meat selection is great, with changing daily specials that includes certified wagyu beef and even Kobe. They also have a good seafood selection. The vegetable selection is also pretty huge, even if I only get the bokchoi. They also have a huge selection of mushrooms. This place is also different from other hotpot places in that they have a conveyor belt throughout the store that you can pick dishes to throw into your pot, priced according to the color of the plate. Only downside might be that it is a la carte and can cost more if you're used to eating at AYCE volume, but if you're here for quality over quantity, then this place is for you.",

For smaller parties, there are tables were you can choose your hot pot items from the conveyor belt.   The servers are extremely attentive and polite. The food arrived fairly quickly. We loved the tomato oxtail, tomato, and original soup bases. According to the servers, the mushroom one is a bit bland in comparison. The mushroom basket and beef combos were worth. They have a station for sauces and they have a lot of options.   Loved it and would definitely come here again!",

My friends and I always end Mn the back room. Maybe cause we're too wild for everyone else. But we love it!   This last time Denny took care of us!!! Made us feel welcome and hooked our drinks up!

    "text": "I've been coming to Vegas a lot and I recently started to find places outside the strip to eat. Walked in with a group of 5 on a Saturday night around 8pm with no reservations (tried to make one via phone but their line seemed to be disconnected?) and we were quickly seated. Must have gotten lucky because as soon as we were seated the restaurant was packed with people waiting. We all did individual pots but they do have family style pots as well..  Tomato Oxtail Pot (added spicy) - 5 Stars: Great flavors with chunks of oxtail meat. I asked for more of the oxtail meat and they brought out more with no problem. I made my broth extra spicy and you can really taste the authenticity of Mongolian style hotpot.   Meat Combo - 4.5 Stars: The quality of the meat was on the medium-high grade and quantity of the meat portion was excellent. The meat combo was only $18 an order and we ordered three between three people who eat meat.  Vegetable Combo - 4 Stars: Great combo, lots of vegetables, and you can also order separately if there are things you don't like. The combo was only $13 an order. An order is good enough for 2 people.  Mushroom Combo - 4.5 Stars: Great variety of mushrooms, love mushrooms and it also cost $13 an order. An order is good enough for 2 people.  Sauce Bar - 5 Stars: There is lots of variety of sauces and condiments to personalize your own sauces!   Aside from order combos, there are individual price points for individual items. There is also a conveyor usually containing vegetables or seafood.   This is also a Vegan/Vegetarian friendly place. We had two people in our group (one was vegetarian/one was vegan). They do have two options of vegan soups - the Assorted Mushroom Pot and the Beautiful Tomato Pot.  Service - 5 Stars: Deni was great at going over the menu, because it may be overwhelming at first. He was always on top of things. He was very attentive and always came back to make sure our pots, water, and trays were filled. He also makes sure your table is well taken care of and food will come out on a fast pace.  Price - $$ It is not all you can eat however their price point is decent.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're in Vegas and craving for some authentic Mongolian Hot Pot. They have a great variety in their sauce bar and vegan option on their hot pot. They have great service and great food. It is one of the best hot pots I've had and I can say it's better than all Mongolian hot pots in San Francisco.",

Pros: - Huge menu! Overwhelming but always great to have a variety of options  - Conveyer belt of goodies which are constantly cycling. Veggies, meats, egg - you name it! There's a sign with the prices per colored plate and you can grab what you want off the conveyer belt at any time. Whatever you take will be added to the bill at the end of your meal, kind of similar to the dim sum concept - Individual hot pots available so you can choose your own broth and place whatever you like in it. The group I dined with opted for this instead of sharing one large hot pot in the middle. I was with 5 others which made this a better option - if there were 3 of us total I wouldn't have minded sharing 1 large hot pot - Love the self serve station with spices, sauces, and pickled sides - so you can make a concoction to your liking to either add into your hot pot or use as a dipping sauce for cooked meat/veggies - Servers come by to refill your hot pot! If you're running low on broth, just request for more!   Cons - Service was slow. All the protein and veggies came out slowly in a random sequence that didn't make sense. We didn't receive our mushroom basket until the very end of our meal, which would have been nice to have had cooking in our hot pots earlier during our meal  - Small portions (but very reasonably priced!) Make sure to order an abundance of any proteins if you're sharing, they go fast   Overall this was a fun, new experience as I've never been to a hot pot restaurant before. I love soup, meat, and veggies... so this place is right up my alley! I will definitely be coming back to Chubby Cattle!",

There is a bar full of different sauces where you can make your own concoctions. I'd recommend asking for an egg and putting some sauces. Might sound weird but it's bomb!  You choose your own soup base. One dislike that I have about the spicy soup base is that here are too many red rectangle pepper things. I honestly don't know what it's called, but every time I tried to scoop out some meat, I got some of those things along with it too which was kind of annoying.  Servers were polite and our drinks were refilled. They have a TV where they had the game playing. Pretty nice modern interior decor.   Parking can be hard to find in this plaza, but it has always been this way. When there's a will, there's a way. Usually I will find a parking spot even if it is super busy.",

    "text": "Chubby Cattle is a MUST if you are visiting Vegas! The concept of a hot pot restaurant is so smart and is executed very well here. The variety of meat, vegetables, noodles, seafood was fabulous and delicious! The value/prices of the dishes was also super reasonable and the portions were perfect! The sauce bar had all of the hot pot sauce favorites including Chinese BBQ sauce (a childhood favorite of mine), oyster sauce, sesame oil and tons of other options. There is a helpful card/sign with recommendations on sauce combinations for the food you plan to cook. The service was very friendly and fast, we were sat and got our individual broth/soups very quickly. To try more soups, you can opt for individual pots or a larger one that the table can share. (GENUIS!) I tried the mushroom broth and the flavor was perfect and so hearty, everything I cooked tasted SO good! Our table also tried the original/house soup and the oxtail and tomato broth (both were phenomenal as well). We are absolutely recommending this restaurant to anyone who is planning a trip to Las Vegas and we are so excited to visit again the next time we are in town! Thank you for your hospitality and delicious food!",

You will definitely need to shower when you get home but it is worth it for you hot pot lovers! The price is a little steep so I would recommend going on a discount night!",

But we were confused because there were empty seats still available.\" I guess two people cannot assigned at four people table size. I felt sad for the owner. Good luck with your business. If you plan to go to this place, make sure you have more than two people because there is no seat for two. Terrible service!!!",

I thought the prices were reasonable though a little on the higher end, but it's not like I was expecting cheap soup here.  Next time, I need to just focus on that conveyor belt because that was supposed to be what I came in there to try!  The free scoop of green tea ice cream for dessert was a nice courtesy too.  :)",

First let me start off that we had a party of 8, when we arrive they tell us they do not have a table to seat us together. We are disappointed but nonetheless we wanted to try it out so we agree. But we are at two separate tables. As our waiter keeps \"asking and waiting\" for people from the other table, and I ask him \"why?\" He's like you're on one check plus 20% gratuity for 6 or more people. I explain that I understand but we are not even sitting together, why would be getting charged together, then I explicitly state TWO checks. His manager, says thats fine. Well our food came our delayed, he never came to check on us, and never refilled our water. He was too busy caring for his two large parties who came after we did and left before us. We FINALLY get the check and guess what?! Wow one bill, then obviously irritated and upset with the poor service we received we did not tip him well, he actually has the nerve to make comment about it!!! Apparently he didn't keep track of who ordered what, of course.  Lastly I will say this, the food isn't that great. Conveyor belt is a fun idea, small portions and expensive. I will not return and my net promoter score would be negative!",

The environment screams good vibes. And the staff gave us good service. We drop our chopsticks and they gave us another one in seconds when we didn't ask for it. Thumbs up to them.

There are lots of flavors, I would recommend asking your server. Then, you get to choose your meat. We did the beef combo and it was plenty of food for 2. We also picked some veggies and noodles from the conveyor belt. I did green tea noodles. Boy...they were delicious! I also added some mushrooms in and made sure to make a special sauce from the sauce bar in the middle. I read so many reviews saying how expensive this was. I'm unsure how anyone spent $80 here for 2 people! The prices are amazing. I could see how getting different foods from the conveyor belt could be expensive (they are charged by plate color) but overall, for 2 of us it was $35 which I thought was amazing! I can't WAIT to come back here and try so much more off of the menu.   I also wanted to give a HUGE shoutout to Sylvia who was extremely helpful and walked us through everything. She mixed special sauce for us and explained what everything on the conveyor belt was. The service is so amazing. There is not 1 negative thing I have to say about Chubby Cattl",

    "text": "This is the best Hot Pot in the west coast and their original soup base is to DIE FOR! $3.99 for the soup? How can you beat that?  Get the beef brisket with the potato noodles. Best combination so far! They hand make EVERYTHING from scratch and you can taste the difference.  My favorite part about Chubby Cattle is their innovation. The conveyor belt is fun, but it's not overwhelming like other places. It's truly an experience to eat here, but you won't have to burn a hole in your wallet to get it.  Most important aspect of all - Service.  Gia is my favorite server here and you have to request her when you eat here. She takes the time to explain the process to you, especially if you have people in your party who are unfamiliar with conveyor belt hot pot. This is a big deal because I have a lot of friends who are intimidated by Asian food.",

You can't go wrong with anything at Chubby a Cattle. You can go full cave man and order tons of meat or stick to veggies and tofu and go more healthy. And don't forget the awesome sauce station that gives you the option to heat up any order. The conveyor belt is just a great plus to the restaurant. They have a limited alcohol menu but with soju and some wines and beer I can't complain. One of the best restaurants in the area and a mainstay in a top food corridors in China Town.",

Everything from fish balls to pork blood.  However what really set this experience apart was the great service! I had Matthew as a server and he was extremely attentive. He would frequently check up on our table, and answered any of our questions.   Highly recommend!",

If you sit next to the conveyer belt you have to option to pick any of the items you would like just at your reach. They also have a great selection of sauces, so if you feel a bit adventurous you can mix them and create your own. They had several meat and seafood packages which allowed us to try some of their most popular meats. I had a great time picking and creating my own soup. However, the service was just terrible. It was almost impossible to get out waters refilled. On top of that we ordered a side dish with our server and he never delivered it. We even reminded him twice and no luck. Thankfully this restaurant had an excellent manager. Joyce was very friendly and tried to accommodate us and help out as much as possible! So I was torn I couldn't give this restaurant a higher rating, but without their manager our overall experience would have been below expectations.",

They're also unique in that they've got raw dishes of food on a conveyer belt you can just take yourself and pay per plate, but we weren't seated next to the conveyor belt so can't comment on that experience. We just ordered full plates of food from the menu. Their hand made shrimp paste recommended by our waiter was out of this world good. Very bouncy texture. And surprisingly their service was very attentive, which isn't the norm for Asian restaurants in general.",

Don't know if it is a weird night, or  just my bad luck or if this has happened before but the whole night was just interesting.   Walking in the door I noticed that they do not accept credit or debit card for the night because their machine is down, not a problem, between my friends and I we have enough cash for the meal.   We started off sharing two soups: the original and tomato - I thought the original soup was delicious, very sweet and savory, also very healthy. Not a fan of tomato so did not care for that. We got a vegetable combination; came in a little basket which is really cute, good variety of veggies too. Got a beef combo which came with brisket, rib-eye and something else. And a noodle combination which came with 4 different types of noodles.   Here is where it gets a interesting: -They informed us that they will be substituting one of the noodle in the combination with something else because they are out with the one that was supposed to be included in the combination -We ordered chicken breast and was told their machine is down so no chicken, then we asked for free range chicken and was told they did not have that either  -Then we wanted more meat and same story - meat cutting machine is down so no other meat besides the hand-cut angus beef - they took $2 off the angus beef because we had no other choice but to order it -My friend wanted the taro knots...they also did not have that -After the meal we wanted to try the fondu for dessert.... and you guessed it - they did not have that either - our server told us that they only had the fondu for the first few days of opening and they stopped it after that because it took too long to prepare and it wasn't profitable... they should take this off the menu then!! They only offer 3 desserts and the picture of the fondu takes up half the page...heavily promoted for an item they no longer offer   So that is that... our meal was not 100% enjoyable because they did not have anything we wanted to order...I will say that the soup was really good, the items that they did have tasted very fresh and delicious, service was also great. All the staff were very friendly, attentive. Shout out to Brandon who was very funny and friendly!",

However I go to one near my home in the San Francisco Bay Area all the time, but decided to visit this based on Andrew Zimmern's recommendation.   Maybe it's because we went at 9.30pm on a week day, but the variety of items in their conveyor belt is sadly lacking.  It was happy hour so conveyor belt items were half off, but there was only 2 types of veggies, two types of tofu, 3 types of fish balls, and almost no mushrooms.  We had to order those basics from the server where of course there was no discount.  There was limited meat and seafood variety too.  We're used to Little Sheep or the dozens of other hot pot restaurants near our house, and while Chubby Cattle has some interesting cuts like their brisket, the other portions were small and nothing special.   On the plus side, we liked that they had different spicy levels of spicy broth, and the numbing spicy was pretty spicy.  Overall it would be a 3.5 Star place but rounding down since the service was soooo slow despite the restaurant being only 25% full.",

Since it was our first time there our server (didn't catch his name sorry!) explained everything to us. He recommended the oxtail and the spicy soup! Which was amazing! My friend absolutely loved the oxtail soup and I fell in love with the spicy soup! We ordered the beef and lamb combo. Which probably would have been enough for three people to share...   I don't have anything negative to say! The price was great. My friend loved the conveyer belt! All in all was a great spot and will be back! Yum!",

They take reservations, and are on time with their reservation time. There was one time that some how my name was on one rsvp list, not the other (they have two). I had to wait a little, and got seated 20' later, which is not bad at all. There are two styles: family and individual. The family pot is a big pot that has dividers to allow three different types of broths at the same time. It serves up to 8 people. The individual pots are 6\" pots that serve only one broth per person.  I have tried tomatoes oxtail broth and the house spicy broth. Both are amazing. The house spicy medium can be very spicy since the broth is boiling hot at all time. Meat is served at good portion. Prime rib and ribeyes are sooooo tender and tasty. Fish filet is a good addition. Their taro noodles, tomato noodles, and the green noodles are delicious. Great change from egg noodles! Last but not least is the friendly and efficient customer service. Our waiters had smiles on their faces. You can feel that everyone is trying their best to make customers happy. We always leave this place happy .",

I ordered the entry level House Hellishly Spicy Pot and let me tell you, it was hot. As someone who loves spicy food, I was even challenged by ENTRY LEVEL. I recommend trying it if you're a fan of spicy food but just be cautious and aware that they're not lying about it being hellishly spicy.  The biggest downside: parking. I'm always hesitant to go to any food places in this area because this plaza's parking sucks. You may end up circling the lot countless times until you get lucky getting a spot!",

Since the renovations, the place definitely smells better when you initially walk in and the sauce bar makes better use of the space now.   You get to choose your soup base and the cost of the meal will depend on how much you decide to add. Brisket is always a go to for us. And no pressure to order everything at once, they have a conveyor belt with add ons depending on the place color, they'll charge.  No matter which soup base you go with, you'll end up adding things to make it tastier unfortunately. The broth is super bland.   Can't really expect too much service since it's kind of a self serve place...if there's more than a 30 minute wait to eat at this place, I'd honestly pick to eat somewhere else.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad place to eat, I just wish I didn't have to customize my food so much and end up with a bit of a pricy bill :(",

I was a little disappointed when they didn't offer the ying yang at that time but my wife got the spicy soup and I got the regular one so I guessed it worked out fine. Our server Dani? and Kevin were both amazing. Our server explained the menu very thoroughly. He recommended the beef combo for our meat and it was definitely a good choice! He also recommended we get the noodles combo and I can't be happier with it.   The food and soup came and I must say their broth is not as savory as other places I've been too, but, as the meat and side dishes started cooking in the soup the broth got a little better. The meat was definitely high quality and the noodles are made fresh daily so I'm really impressed with the noodles. The prices were pushing it a little but it was nice to try fresh noodles and the good quality meat.",

He also explained how to do the sauces, cook the foods and answered the numerous other questions we threw at him.   The food was delicious, especially the wagu beef, in both slice and dumpling form.

We've never had Chinese hot pots before but we were curious about this place because we saw this featured on one of those food network shows (either Bourdain or Zimmern). Now, I've been to a couple of these restaurants that were featured on many of these shows and some of them were overhyped. This one did NOT disappoint.  I was expecting this place to be much more crowded, but we got here a half hour or so after they opened so there wasn't that many people. I got the tomato broth and he got the regular broth. Basically you order your meats, noodles, and some veggies. If there is something you forgot, you can always ask the server for the menu or you can grab one of the rotating plates on the conveyer belt. All have different price points depending on the color of the plate.  Our servers were super nice; they kept checking in with us and always refilled our waters. By the time we were finished we were so full!  It's kinda pricey but absolutely worth it and in line with what you'd pay on the Strip anyway. We are definitely coming here again the next time we are in Las Vegas. Keep in mind this is off the strip so you'll either have to drive or take an Uber if you're not local.",

The quality of the meat was A+ and it definitely beat going to a Vegas buffet because of the familiarity of the food. I enjoyed the huge variety of the sauce bar but wished they had a straight up goma sauce like most shabu places. I loved the little glass inserts on the table where you can stick your phone but can still see your messages! The conveyor belt was a nice touch and convenient so we didn't have to keep ordering from someone or get up. The waitress was Jenny I think and she was very sweet and knowledgeable.

I ordered the vegan mushroom soup, and we chose a number of seafood options, as well as tofu and vegetables.   Participatory/creative food experiences are a fun way to try something new, and this was no exception. As our items came, we dropped them (sometimes clumsily) in the soup, and adjusted the heat accordingly. Honestly, this is a bit of trial and error, but you aren't likely to really overcook anything. The scallops and shrimp are must-haves here, after a few minutes in the hot pot, they are incredibly tender and fresh. An Asahi or Tsingtao goes well with this experience too. Skip the strip and visit Chubby Cattle next time. Despite the name, this place is very pescatarian and vegetarian friendly.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try this place. Its a chinese style hotpot that has a rotating bar much like that of a sushi spot that has extra ingredients you can add to your hot pot.  Theres a sauce bar that has all kinds of yummy sauces to add to your soup as well. They also have bottomless edamame and congee- although at night when we were there the porridge was out. You get your own little soup burner and they bring the additional meats or items on menu out to you.  We got the spicy soup base which was a szechuan style mixture and the oxtail soup base which was also very good.  The ingredients were fresh. The servers were very nice and helpful.  If you don't like close quarters do not sit at bar. Its a very asian style dining and youre just there to eat and leave.  It reminded me of the food stalls in Korea. Sit at a table if you really want to enjoy the experience.  Its a little more expensive than most places in chinatown about 30 per person. Cheaper than the strip though and the food is good!   Happy souping!",

All the ingredients we picked off the conveyor belt were fresh. We order a plate of beef with all types of variety. And they all were delish.   They have a cool bar where you can make your own sauce. It also included kimchi and edamame.  We saw this place on Andrew Zimmerman's show and it was so worth it!!!",

The house special was pretty bland out of all 4. The spicy tomato was very flavorful. So far the ox tail and tomato soup base are the winners.  Went on a Thursday and the spicy tomato was 50% off but they charged 3.99. The regular tomato is 4.99 and +1 for making it spicy. Not sure why it was 3.99 at 50% off.",

    "text": "I love Mongolian hot pot!!!  Little sheep being my favorite!  Even if I have a favorite place that I go to, i still love trying to find better!  However when I yelped a place in Vegas, this chubby cattle place got very good ratings.  To much of my excitement I was immensely disappointed.  I was intrigued by the idea of conveyor belts and grab what you want type style of eating.    The conveyer belt - NO good choices and very poorly stocked.  The same items kept flowing by making their millionth rounds bc no one would grab anything.  An utter disappointment.  Meat - low quality and old.  I specifically asked for lamb shoulder meat, but the waitress indicated it can only be ordered as a combo with beef.  That was fine, as I like beef as well.  The lamb shoulder was not lamb shoulder.  It was lamb leg.  Dry and tasteless.  The beef, well it was also dry.  I wanted beef belly.  I typically enjoy fatty meets.  Since they don't carry beef belly, the waitress suggested brisket.  I know my cuts of meat, brisket isn't fatty.  The meatballs were also tasteless and wasn't enticing in any way.    Seafood - shrimp skewers were good.  I can't assess anymore in this since that's all I had in this category.  Veggies - like any other place.  Service - was alright, could always be better!  I gave this place a 1 Star bc I was excited and it turned out to be everything opposite of what I hoped for.",

    "text": "I've eaten here a couple times and I've enjoyed the experience. I'm vegan, and the vegan tomato broth is really good. Today, it was a little bit different, because there's also a non vegan tomato broth and I didn't even notice they gave me that one until maybe thirty minutes into the meal when I finally noticed an OXTAIL in my pot.   I'm not sure how other people eat hot pot, but I sort of just drop stuff into my personal pot and pull it out with chop sticks after it's cooked, so I can see why I didn't notice the oxtail at the bottom until there was less broth there after it cooked out (for anyone curious to how I didn't notice it earlier).  I asked for a replacement, and they happily obliged, and apologized. I wasn't mad, but this could've turned out differently if it was someone else. I'm just hoping that this doesn't hope to anyone following other dietary guidelines based on beliefs/religions, because I've seen how put off people can get.   Also, when someone else in my party wanted a refill on their broth, a server had THEM refill it. We don't work there, why should we do your damn job? That honestly bothered me more than being given meat broth by mistake. That person being really far into the booth wasn't an issue either, because another guest on the opposite side of the table didn't have to refill their own pot. Also, the person that had to refill their own broth ALSO ordered the vegan tomato broth, and they also found meat in their broth later on in the meal.   I shouldn't have to worry about simple things like the wrong broth because I like to have faith in the employees. Now when I eat here, and I will have to put more trust in myself and less in the employees because of the mistake of broths made today. The other guest having to refill their own broth just made it worse.   On the plus side, the self serve dipping sauce bar seemed to expand a bit on ingredients (or maybe because we ate here earlier than usual) and the sauce I made was faaaantaaaastic. The garlic and the garlic and chili paste made the dipping sauce way better than anything I've made before.   Overall, good meal, but could've been better.",

I Uber over and have to wait 30 minutes. I don't care, I love the food but I ask the manager to have the chef prepare me fish balls because I specifically came for them. After questioning me about whether or not I would eat them I ask for an order that the manager assured me of. I finally sit down with my party of five to receive my food to then find out that the fish balls I ordered were not only never made but the person that prepares them had left. I make an annual trip to Vegas and honestly I felt like a second rate customer. Possibly because we are a young group of males, I feel that the employees just never took us seriously and thats the fault of youth. It really sucked getting grilled from the manager about something you specifically want and they completely ignored the request when I show my patronage and support. My annual trip to this place may not happen anymore because of this. Damn shame, but honestly I felt almost disrespected by the fact that they ignored my eager desire to eat something they make specific hours for. I'm only writing this because the waiter asked me to write a review and be honest, hopefully they see this and listen when a customer speaks regardless of me being a tourist, a single male, or Asian. Was going to make it 3 stars but I had made a big deal about eating the stupid fish balls and showed up an hour and a half before the chef was supposed to leave, at 10:30pm, and yet i didn't get what I mainly came for. Couldnt give me my simple request and I felt patronized when I asked for it before sitting and expressed my concerns to it being prepared prior to me getting a table which could have been after I was seated. Really really sucked to be ignored when I spent money on a sizeable meal.",

The broths we tried were original house pot, sea view, and entry level hell. The broths were very flavorful and fragrant. My personal favorite is the sea view broth.      They had a variety of items on their menu such as meats, vegetables, sauces, and BBQ. My friends and I tried the beef & lamb combo, lobster, fish balls, etc., and assorted vegetables. My favorite sauces would have to be the Thai chili and house special sauce.       The presentation of the food was beautiful and clean. They have a conveyer belt with assorted cooked and uncooked items which is a very unique feature for a hot pot restaurant. A great place for family and friends!",

Their menu also includes many different vegetables, fish and noodles. Your meat is cooked in 5 different broths, all of them look very delicious, although their house broth is a little bit bland.

This place is new and had lots of positive reviews, but I can't say that I'm a fan of this place...  Fellow Yelpers have disappointed on this one, which makes me wonder if all the reviews are real.  Everything here adds an extra costs to your meal.  Soup base = minimum $4.  Want noodles in your soup?  Another $3-4.  Meat?  Anywhere from $5 and up.  Each little plate that rotates around = additional cost (from $1-4).  Some plates are reasonable, but others are just ridiculous.  I think we paid like $3 for a couple pieces of lettuce, because it's considered a \"daily special\".  Perhaps there's some better way of ordering, but it was not explained to us very well.  For two people (that just drank water), the bill ended up over $50 for some noodle soup that wasn't impressive at all.  Service for us wasn't too great either.  Seats were available, but the hostess told us to sit in the corner only to come over less than a minute later and tell us our seats were ready.  We weren't given a menu, but there was one nearby.  Turns out, it was originally given to the people next to us.  But, the hostess pointed out for us to use it when we were sat down.  We ordered noodles, but those didn't come until long after we started.  And, I paid the tab with a $100 bill and the women who took the money asked if I needed change...  Really?  I'm not poor, but I'm not wealthy enough to be tipping the same amount as my bill.  Especially when I'm cooking my own food.",

They have a bar to mix your own sauce with a lot of variety of sides to go with it. On the menu the portions are broken into small and large but the smalls are like 3-4 pieces. They're all fresh items though. Xiao Xiao is extremely nice and always checked up on us to make sure we had everything.

We were seated within 2 minutes to a larger table, and our waiter was very helpful with all of the different options. He recommended we do a split pot, which gave us the choice of two different broths. Everything came out promptly, and having the conveyor made it easy to add our ingredients. One of the most interesting dining experiences we've had here in Vegas, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Def plan on bringing friends and family here next time.",

We can understand it's busy, happy with his effort.  We're not big on meat, ordered a plate of lamb and small size veggies for variety.  Also tried their gizzard and lamb on skewer.  The sauce station in the CENTER of the room drove me crazy. It's impossible to huddle around many hungry people to fix a sauce.  I wish it was against a wall where there can be some form of a line system  The bill came out to $55 for 2 which isn't too bad, but considering we have small appetite and only had 1 plate of meat and no seafood, quite overpriced.  If you have a big appetite, 2 people easily $100+  After reviewing the receipt. We noticed the $3.99 for my house broth and my moms $6.99 for her Hot Spicy Broth.  Also $2.99 for sauteed sauce.  I am familiar with hot pot restaurant that charges for broth, but usually they have a complimentary broth and you may pay for upgraded broth.  But I took a second look on the menu and noticed even for the larger shared broth is charged per person vs other competitors charge by pot regardless of the size of the party.  Pretty much the moment we sat down, before we can try anything on the menu. We already spent $10 on the broth which is a must have for hot pot no?! lol   Service was great, food was overpriced. Would come back should a friend wants to go but not on my own.",

    "text": "We love the food here, we really REALLY do. If it was based on the flavor and quality of the food alone, then I'd easily give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, service plays a huge factor in the overall dining experience.   We've been here twice now within a week because the flavor and quality of the food is that good! However, the staff is very clearly inexperienced. Some don't even really speak English that well either. I can speak Mandarin too, so I don't mind because I can just switch languages to accommodate. But they don't really know their own menu or the fact that the soup for children 12 and under is marked as half price on their menu. I get that they're new, but part of the hiring process should include hiring experienced management who can teach and lead a successful staff... and training that staff prior to opening.   When we came here last week, the hostess gave me a business card so I can call and check on how we were progressing on the 45 min wait we were quoted. We weren't planning on going anywhere so I didn't have a need to call that day. Today, I did call because I knew they took reservations. Guess what? The phone number printed on their business card is wrong. The number here on Yelp is correct though so I was still able to call. When we got there, I mentioned the error to the hostess, who then pointed it out to the manager who had no idea of the typo. He even grabbed a phone to try calling the number himself (though I would think that most people should know the phone number to their job and just recognize the typo). Did everyone from the owners, management, wait staff, etc not notice this?? Or is this more a reflection of a staff that doesn't care?   Now let's talk about the dining experience. On both visits, it took a while between getting seated until anyone acknowledges you to take your order (in the 20 min ballpark). Once you've ordered, it will take equally as long to get the soup. The stuff you order from the menu won't come out together either, or even relatively at the same time. For example, today we ordered 3 plates of meat and 3 large bowls of noodles off the menu. The noodles and one plate of meat came out quickly, but we were literally done with all of that and everything we took from the conveyer belt before the last 2 plates of meat arrived. Our drinks didn't come out together either! There were 4 of us and only my juice came out before the food. After the food came out we asked about the 3 waters... which was met with the waitress bringing one and walking away. Which led to us having to hail her down again to get 2 more. Really? I also saw the waitress talking to the table next to us... and one of the bussers interrupted her from helping those guests to show her/comment on the tip that was left by the next table over. That was probably a conversation that could have been saved for when the waitress wasn't at a table in the middle of talking to a customer. Whatever the case, with all of the delays with their service, both visits we've made have turned out to be 2+ hour ordeals, which is excessive for hot pot. After today, we're totally not that motivated to come back anytime soon. Based on service alone, we'd rather pay more and drive further to go to Red Pot even though their food quality isn't as good.",

    "text": "A good business would NOT have seated us without telling that HALF OF THE MENU was \"out\" and allowed an entire table to dine on just vegetables (the meat cutter was down so we were told 30-40 mins into dinner that we would not get any meat!!!). Our check was $73!!! We were still starving and had to stop by McDonalds on the way home. WTF!  First and foremost, this review is due to the fact that almost everything I wanted on the menu was met with a \"we don't have it right now.\" So they didn't have any of the ramen on the menu or any fried tofu, etc. So we were left with getting a vegetable variety and beef brisket. We were starving so we ate the vegetables and other random items that was rolling around the restaurant. 20 mins later, when we still haven't gotten our beef brisket, we asked for it. Our waiter came back and said that the machine was down. Mind you, we have been asking for everything at least twice before receiving it (including our water and our broth). Needless to say, our table of five had VEGETABLES for dinner, no meat! We asked for our check and was extremely upset.  The two stars I left is for our waiter. Though we had to continually ask for water and broth, we did eventually get it. He was extremely busy. I feel bad for him because he had to be the bearer of  bad news about the meat cutter being down.  Needless to say, I will never be going back here.",

We were sated at the bar which I felt was a bit tight in space, can't move around too much. We decided to order soup base of ying yang but was told can't do it at the bar, so we asked to be moved to bigger table but will be charged 3 times the amount listed in the menu. Ridiculous! We weren't even told there were dipping sauce for us to chose from the sauce station, even the person next to us didn't know about it. First time here, gotta inform us of such! Felt that the conveyer belt is lacking green veggies. Was told that Soup base was cooked for hours with chicken bones and other bones with no MSG and has  lots of Chinese herbs. The host girl went around and asked if the soup has any flavors and  I told her it was bland, but I drink the soup at the end of my meal, it has better flavor and sweet too , good!. So taste the soup at the end not beginning. Price was a bit steep for the pocket on a regular bases . I will only come on special occasions and they need to work out all the kinks as mentioned.",

James was our server and he was super awesome, recommended us a lot of good choices, explained how the belt works, and made sure we didn't over order so we weren't bursting at the seams (still happened anyway). Food was delicious, everything was incredibly fresh. We were in town visiting family and even though it was 106 degrees outside, hot pot was amazing. Great selection of meats, veggies, fish balls, tofu, etc. Sauce bar had so many choices! Delicious! I can't wait to come back again when I visit. This compares really well to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot in Northern California, except Chubby Cattle's sauce bar has way more options!",

There's so much on it from veggies, seafood, random stuff and several different types of tofu! Check the conveyer belt before they come to order because we didn't and some of the stuff we ordered was actually on there! Get the beef combo it's so good! The broths are so good too but the hot is extra hot I could barely eat it! They have all kinds of sauces that you get to serve yourself which is cool!

The place we went to had a bunch of pre made sauces which is fine and all, but I like the fact that we can make anything we want how we want it.. which is basically one of the staples of hot pot, right?   All in all, Chubby Cattle is definitely our go to place now. Attentive service, great, quality food. No complaints. We'll definitely be back again soon!",

    "text": "To start off, I'd like to say that the staff is very nice. That being said, it was still a disappointing experience. I'm a newbie to hotpot, and I was used to the checklist format found at Little Sheep. To say the least, I was a little intimidated by the thought of a conveyor belt. I ordered the mushroom broth and my S.O. ordered the medium spicy pot. We sat in front of the conveyor belt for 10...15...20 minutes with no broth. We started to wonder if we were supposed to go somewhere to actually get the broth.  Finally, the broth came out, then the veggies, then the meat. The meat was decent quality and the veggies we ordered were fresh, but the pieces of cauliflower garnish that came with my tomato noodles were moldy - not like a few spots of black that one may just cut off at home, but like an entire half of a piece was trimmed off to account for the mold.  The food from the conveyor belt, however, was dried out. We went during happy hour, so it was understandable that the conveyor belt wasn't a fresh as possible, but some of the items were shriveled enough that they weren't readily recognizable as food. Also, the conveyor items come on cafeteria style plates, with plastic covers (most of them cracked and frosty), giving a very cheap feel.  The food was good, but not good enough to warrant the price tag.",

    "text": "So I really love eating here but a few small things keep it from being five stars. First the good, love the concept of individual hot pots and pulling the mix-it's from a conveyer belt. It's engaging, interactive and fun. The staff is generally nice and the most of the food is really tasty. I know now what I like and I get it every time and so I know it will taste great. Get the tomato broth base its phenomenal with mushroom a close second if you like it filled with all kinds of different mushrooms. The spicy soup base is almost inedible, just avoid it. It's too frustrating to eat because it's filled with so many inedible herbs and roots, like eating a soup of tree bark. And it forces you to separate your edible mix-ins from the inedible items which takes forever. You're trying to eat a noodle and it's wrapped around a stick, arghhh.  So the few downsides, the array of side snacks (along with sauce mix-ins) is so often depleted well before closing. We show up with hours until close and the bins of things like edamame or fruit or crackers or whatever that day are almost always empty and don't get refilled. Secondly the conveyer belt selection is hit or miss and there's no rhyme or reason to what they put out. Sometimes there's a lot of one thing and nothing of others, and it's frustrating that seemingly the two sides of the belt are not connected, so often I see something on the other side of the room that will never come to us. So I've taken to getting up and walking over to the other side of the restaurant to check the other selection.  Also the pricing is weird and ordering something from the server is often 2-3 times the belt price which is frustrating when you have to ask for it cause they forget to restock the belt. They don't consistently give everyone the same utensils so I go to serve myself the soup and I have a slotted spoon but others have a ladle. You have to ask for what should just be there. Overall these are all issues of inconsistency. It doesn't ruin the experience, just annoying when I love the food. But it doesn't seem to bother most people cause it gets pretty crowded. I'm one of those regulars so for all it's flaws, it's still pretty great!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and it is a decent place if you are craving some hot pot without having to serve yourself as everything comes out family style and you just cook it in the broth yourself.    One time I had the tofu I ordered smelled really bad like it was old and not refrigerated with the rest of the vegetables, when I asked that they need to replace it, they rolled their eyes and travesties me horribly for the rest of the night. The service was really rude, but that is something I cannot put up with.   The final straw why this place will never get my business again is that I called to make a reservation and the lady on the phone said they do not take reservations. So I showed up and she immediately asked me if I had a \"reservation\" which I said you told me on the phone you do not take reservations which she said \"oh yes that's right.\"    Behind her there was a huge sign that said CASH ONLY so I asked where I could get cash from and she rudely told me to walk across the street to the supermarket to find an ATM.    To top all of that off I asked how long the wait was, she walked around in a full circle without even checking the tables and said 30-45 minutes for three people with no one in front of us.  If you continue to eat here you must enjoy bad service, limited options to pay, very rude staff, and a long arbitrary wait.    I'm very happy there are superior options in town which I will be frequenting.",

    "text": "I was sooooo excited to try this place. I found out about this place via a video on Facebook and I was so glad to have found out about it when I did because we were going to Vegas! Revolving hot pot sounded like a dream. Also wanted to make a disclaimer that this is NOT an AYCE hot pot restaurant.  They open at 5 and we had a concert at around so we tried to get there as soon as they opened. We were initially going to be sat at the high top tables, but soon realized we wouldn't get to experience the conveyor belt of ingredients. So we told the hostess we were willing to wait.  When we were sat, we ordered our broth. I got the mushroom and my boyfriend got the tomato oxtail. I definitely messed up cause his was honestly the best hot pot broth I've tried thus far. Perfect amount of spice and a generous amount of oxtail.   In terms of the menu, we ordered both the tomato and green tea noodle as well as 2 orders of the lamb shank. We underestimated just how much lamb it really was... 2 rows of highly piled lamb. We were determined. How the conveyor belt works is each plate/bowl has a color. Depending on the color, determines the price. We grabbed spam, imitation crab, and enoki mushroom.  While the broths were boiling, we made our own sauces. There's plenty of ingredients so you're bound to find something you like. What I think skewed our experience was what makes this place worth it/special from other hot pot places is their basket/specialty baskets/plates. Those were a bit on the more pricey side, hence my boyfriend and I ordered what we ordered. But the couple next to use ordered a mushroom basket as well as the wagyu beef with egg. So if that's what you're after, then I think this place excels there.  However, the ingredients (specifically lamb and the conveyor belt ingredients) weren't the freshest. But what do you expect, I guess? After all of that plus a hot tea, it was still very affordable. Not sure if that's because we were in Vegas or if it's the restaurant. But it was good for what it was worth!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time with my boyfriend and can say that this is our new favorite hot pot spot in Las Vegas. We are from Southern California and have had some very disappointing hot pot in Las Vegas in the past that we don't even bother trying anymore. After finally crawling out of our comfort zone, we decided to give this place a try and it delivered. Service was attentive and quick, and the broths are very flavorful. We really like the variety of selections they offer as well and the DIY sauce station. Although we still prefer hot pot in SoCal, this place really hits the spot for Las Vegas. We will definitely be repeating customers.  On another note, they have a conveyer belt as well. It's kind of cool, but we still prefer ordering to ensure fresh quality lol",

So we decided to wait for that.   We picked the house spicy sauce and oxtail tomato broth. I really liked the oxtail, it was really good and reminded me of Tom yum soup.  The dishes on the conveyer belts are vegetables, udon, fish cakes, rice cake, clams and tofu (basically all the side stuff).   You order the meat with the server. We got the beef combo and lamb combo. The quality of the meat was okay, it kinda broke apart before we could cook it and it was thin.   There's a station for sauces where you can make your own. Thought that was pretty cool.   In the end we split the bill and it came out to be about $17 per person which is pretty good for shabu dinner. I think the BOGO made it worth it.",

There's a conveyor belt that circles around with veggies, dough sticks, taro, glass noodles etc. You can also order off the menu for meat combos, lobster, and crab.  Plates on the conveyor belt are small. They count per plate. Cost wise it's expensive and although i'm glad i can say ive experienced it, there are less costly delish shabu/hot pot places to go. Plus with a big group it's difficult to eat out of 1 pot on a square table and you have to disturb the people by the conveyor belt to grab the items you want. Service was good,  place is clean, items were fresh.",

Also, if you het seated on the private room, you'll smell like hotpot when you leave.   Jiaming is very accomodating and really caters quickly to all your requests.

    "text": "Back to this very good hot pot place in Las Vegas.  The line is certainly much longer and the crowd is now more diverse instead of mostly Chinese or Asian in my previous visit.  This is most likely due to Andrew Zimmern put this restaurant sometimes ago on between my two visits, on his TV show \"The Zimmern List\" which boosted the restaurant's popularity.  Here's the summary:  0. Get the spicy brother and order either beef ribeye ($9.99) or beef combo ($18.99) and you're good to go (if spicy is your thing too).  The ribeye was the best meat out of the 6 different ones we ordered that night.  1. Staff was still very friendly, no doubt.  2. Soup base (spiciest) was good.  3. Sauce bar selection was good.  4. Beef (didn't order pork or seafood this time, ordered and tried everything except A5 Wagyu) was good but not as good as it was.  The brisket plate which I raved about on my previous visit is no longer the same.  Quality and serving size of different beef plates are now smaller so it's now pricier.  *Missed taking pictures of some beef ordered as I got busy feeding my kids.  5. The noodles are made fresh in house using what looks like pasta maker, it was pretty good.",

I've had their beef combo, short rib and egg, lamb, and pork, and the meat quality's been pretty good. I've only gotten the spicy pot for my soup base, and it's got a lot of spices and flavor.   The sauce bar is a nice addition. I try to come up with a different concoction of sauces every time.  They also have that conveyor belt, but it's only worth it for the happy hour IMO. Food can get a little pricey, because it all adds up. If you're a big eater like me, you'll probably end up spending between $40-$50.  And I gotta throw this out there. Man, during our last visit, our server was trying waaayyyy too hard to upsell every single thing on the menu, like c'mon bro. Get off deez nuts!",

He did an amazing job coaching our whole table through the menu and all of his recommendations were spot on. The spicy broth is pretty spicy so don't let your noodles sit in there too long.

I'd recommend the heavenly tomato broth. It is SO GOOD, I don't even have to use sauce. Get it if you like Tom yum soup. Order the handmade noodles of your choice and a small amount of veggies for an extra dollar. Order any meats you'd like. Remember the portions are pretty filling!  Then keep an eye out for your faves on the conveyor belt, which are veggies, noodles, some seafood, and tofus. The color of the place tells you how much each one costs. So many options. So little stomach room.  There is a sauce bar toward the front of the restaurant - add whatever you'd like to the sesame sauce base.  Oh, and Chubby cattle also has a bar!  The only thing is that this place gets busy, so it's hard to track someone down for refills.",

He was VERY patient with us and explained everything step by step and helped us choose the dishes by our taste preference. He made it a truly personal experience.   We opted for the Spicy base and a mushroom base. I asked if I could get the mushroom base spicy and Deni was happy to accommodate. We also ordered the veggie combo, noodles, seafood combo, deer platter special, the sea bass special, and a beef combo. Everything was amazing! Thanks to Deni, we knew in which order to cook the foods and how to eat them and how to work the heater.   There is a conveyor belt of hotpot dishes, but if this is your first time, I highly suggest letting the server know. Deni told us of a vegetarian who picked up a black bowl from the conveyor only to find out vegetable dishes are NOT in black bowls. So, he asked us to hold off on the conveyor until we could ask what was in the bowl. (LOL)  We are definitely going back. We're so happy to have accidentally found this spectacular place. I highly recommend the Chubby Cattle, especially for a unique dining experience and for those special holidays like Valentine's, Anniversaries, or Birthdays.",

We have too many savants and cooks (not of the classically trained caliber, but True Chinese women that slave in the kitchen for hours). This was one of the best hotpot meals outside of our home. There will be a wait if you have more than 2 and don't want to sit at the counter, but trust me when I say it is worth every minute of the wait. Fresh Wagyu beef, sparkling and smoking seafood displays, and a conveyor belt that circles in and out of the kitchen making sure all items are fresh. As one with a plant based diet, can I tell you how awesome it is to leave full (and not on just rice).   Aside from the delicious meal we had, our server Deni was THE MAN! Again, I have a demanding family and they will at times \"bark\" orders at our servers. He was patient and quick with every request. I'm from the service industry and know it cannot be easy to be on top of every table when you are at max occupancy and have people waiting an hour +. He is definitely an asset and great compliment to Chubby Cattle's staff.   All in all, don't go hungry because you may have to wait, but be ready to eat.",

The seafood combo platter was a little on the expensive side given the quantity ($20, which came with 3-4 pieces each of mussels, scallops, shrimp, and crab sticks). The soup comes with free refills though! I ordered their oxtail soup, which is now mixed with their tomato base, and found that the tomato flavor was a little overpowering (good for people who like their soups sour I guess). The mushroom and original soups, on the other hand, were perfect and had the right depth of flavor. Our server, Deni, was very accommodating and constantly checked up on us for our party of 5, despite it being a busy Friday evening. Overall, I would recommend this place if you want to sit down and enjoy some soup!",

Upon arriving there, she thanked us for calling in advance. How nice of her to remember!   I was reccommended to this place by a friend, and I was no doubt satisfied. In Las Vegas there are basically no conveyor belt restaurants, but Chubby Cattle happened to be an exception! I still wish this included sushi as well though. Anyways, on to the good stuff. This restaurant is hot pot-based, with the side dishes rotating around on a motorized conveyor belt. I LOVE IT. Different dishes have different prices usually ranging from $1-$4 I believe, but its all pretty affordable. I ordered the house pot, which tasted like mushroom or chicken broth, which was delicious. From the conveyor belt, I decided to take sliced beef, tteokbokki(korean rice cakes), chopped spam, spinach, and what looked like buckwheat noodles. All of these made a delicious combination. The only thing to watch out for, is the temperature of the soup. When you aren't cooking the ingredients, make sure to deactivate the heater, or else you are in for quite the tongue-searing ride.   Between this and Pho, I would definitely choose hotpot. Why so? Hot pot is customizable, and can be heated right from your table. This plus the conveyor belt truly ended off my shopping trip with a bang. If you are coming to eat here, make sure to bring some friends! If you don't, then have no fear; there is a bar-like seating area for those who are riding solo. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!",

The smell when you first walk in is very overwhelming, but not in a bad way. It's in a way where you get excited to eat!   We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess. In all honesty, she is the only reason I am not giving them just a 1 star.   After we explained that it was our first time here, our hostess was kind enough to explain how the menu worked. She went over the soup bases, meats, what was on the conveyor belt, and any additional side items. It was neither of ours first time going to a hot pot. But it was the first of this nature for both of us. And our hostess made ordering easy.   The soup was tasteful and flavorful, while the brisket was my favorite menu item to order from. The conveyor belt idea is very creative and I'm glad to have experienced it.   A reason for the negative stars is because we were both extremely dissatisfied with the service given to us by the other employees of this location, especially our waiter. We asked three times for a bowl for soup and rice (each time we ordered a new meat, we asked them about those two items) and we NEVER received EITHER of it. Not once did he check up on our table, but he did manage to find time to talk to his friend who so happened to visit. We were very upset that his friend ended up getting a bowl of rice, even though we ordered way before he was even seated.   Overall, I wish again that I could like this place. But the (lack of) service that was shown to us really left a bad taste in our mouths. Maybe we caught our server on a bad day, or we just sat on the wrong side of the bar. Either way. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "First off, when you first enter the restaurant it had kind of a weird smell from the raw seafood. You get used to it after a while. What's cool about this place is that you get to build your own soup. The restaurant has this conveyer belt style so that you can choose what you want in your soup.  So my man and I never really go to a lot of shabu shabu style restaurants. We decided to try this place out. We were soooo confuse. Our hostess gave us this attitude like she was shock we didn't know how to do it. Lady, that's why we were asking how to do it. Luckily, our server Matthew was great. He explained to us how to do it. So we ordered the original soup base and a medium spicy soup base. Let me tell you, I can handle a lot of spicy food but man that medium spicy soup base was SPICY!! I literally was tearing up. I had our server change my soup base to original.  So if you decide to get that spicy soup base, beware.  Okay the reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because our experience was not so good. We were confuse. They had charged me for the spicy soup base when I only had one bite of it. I changed it to original. Usually restaurants can accommodate  that for you esp. if they notice you were burning up and tearing. And I didn't like how that hostess was rude to us. Also, the oysters wasn't fresh. :/ I did like the broth but I didn't like how the aromatics they put in the broth made it hard to enjoy. I found myself trying to spit it out. I know they gave us the slotted spoon but still it was hard to enjoy.",

    "text": "Hot pot places isn't usually the first thing I crave but we have heard and read so many good things about that my boyfriend and I thought to give it a try. What really caught my attention was the conveyor belt feature they have because there is no place in vegas that does it. Unfortunately it's too bad it's not a sushi place. We expected it to be busy since it was a Saturday but the wait wasn't too bad. About 25 min wait to sit for 2 near the conveyor belt. So there is a few different areas, there is a bar style, booth or like big family round tables. Service was great as soon as we sat down. The waiter was super nice and explained everything we needed to know. First you order the broth. They have a few choices to choose from. We decided to get 1 house special and 1 house special spicy. By far, the spicy broth was way more flavorable and you can decide how spicy you want it. The house special was alright if you simple taste. Then u order the type of meat. On yelp I saw the cool seafood platter so that's what I got (which was a mistake) and my boyfriend ordered the lamb and beef combo (good choice). Those 2 orders alone had me really full. Unfortunately, I didn't have the energy or space to pick something out of the conveyor belt but it was nice for pics. The dishes inside vary from meat to seafood to veggies to noodles. The reason why the seafood was a mistake was cause most of it was on the conveyor belt like the shrimp, scallops, and mussels. It was the display of the seafood platter that really only caught my attention.  The other cool part about this place was that you could create your own dipping sauce at the sauce station! The 2 things that really stood out in this place was the broth and sauce station hands down. Oh, I believe rice is also free because my boyfriend ordered a side of it.  Cons about this place is the limited space u have if u eat at the bar area where the conveyor is. It's pretty tight when u have people on both sides of you.  The meat was alright. The seafood was alright. Nothing special. Fresh though. But what really gives it it's taste is the broth and the sauce u create with it.  Overall the bill was about $50. But only because I think we mistakenly ordered the seafood platter which was about $20. The lamb and beef combo was about $16.99 and I believe the brother is $3-6 bucks. My boyfriend said he wasn't full but just about right. However for me, I felt super full. Definitely worth a try! It's also fun to take pics on your experience. :)",

They still remembered me when I came back for more, too.  The meat is always so goooood. I love the rib-eye and brisket. I've tried the spicy broth, house original, and mushroom. When I ordered the spicy one, I didn't really take them seriously and went for a medium level, I think it's best to start with the entry level spicy if it's your first time here. I honestly can't tell if I like the mushroom or original hotpot better, both are really tasty. The mushroom is a more subtle broth but if you love mushrooms like me, it's great.  Honestly, I really, really like this place, but I can't give in 5 stars because it's sooo expensive, overpriced in my opinion. All of the Shabu-shabu places I've been to charge for their meat, and the choice of broth comes with your order of meat. Those shabu places also include a vegetable platter and a bowl of rice. At Chubby Cattle, they charge you separately to add rice, any veggies are their own prices on the menu, and the broth itself is also charged to your bill. Everything adds up so fast!! I feel like at least rice should be included because it's kind of hard to just eat meat in sauce for an entire meal.  Also, the cilantro in their self-serve sauce bar could be a bit fresher... (some of it is turning black sometimes...)",

It was savory and flavorful. We got the lamb and beef platter as well as assorted mushrooms and vegetables.  Joyce even went out  of her way to make us sample sauces. I would definitely recommend this place and would come here again",

They have a create your own sauce station so you can create your own dipping sauce.

First, the broth, I liked mine, it was entry level hell- at first really spicy but as I ate it down it was fine. I made myself a decent dipping sauce, but would love it if there were some suggestions. Meat and vegetables seemed very fresh, but too expensive for me. The amount of meat given per dish was not that much for the price. The amount of vegetable was fine. I didn't partake of any rice or noodles but they seemed very run of the mill. I didn't take anything from the conveyor belt, and I didn't notice anyone else taking any either. I sort of question the freshness of the dishes and the dishes themselves, some sort of informational chart would be helpful.  The people around me seemed to enjoy their food. Service was slow because they were crazy busy. We asked for soup spoons, twice, then received iced tea like spoons. We never had our water refilled, and didn't get much attention. Deni was our server, he was just too busy for us. He came by to ask us to fill out a survey and check in on Yelp to get some free ice cream. Another server plopped down the ice cream when we weren't done with our food - honestly I would have ordered more, but they never asked. For the 3 of us, the total was about $62, I'd much rather go to an all you can eat KBBQ place and pay a little more. I'd say Chubby Cattle, is good to try once, but I wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "First time I came here was little than a week ago. I came here with 2 friends and my girlfriend and we're very excited off of the reviews, let alone the sound of this place. To start, the first time was amazing, great service and great food. Our waiter was attentive and the hostess made sure things went well. HOWEVER the reason of my review is because of our second trip which was tonight.   My girlfriend and I went because the first time was amazing. However, it was one of the most irritating times I ever had at a restaurant and usually I'm very easy to please. The hostess was PERFECT as always but the server wasn't. I don't know if it was his first time or not but I see it how if you mess up once, fix it. First we ordered the beef combo and got a lamb and beef and after I tried politely to tell him it was the wrong order, he told me I was the one who ordered it and it wasn't his mistake. I didn't order it and what I originally ordered was more expensive so why would I lie about that in the first place when I'm about to pay for the more expensive one that I ordered?? Second, through our meal it seemed as if we offended him with getting what we originally ordered that he stopped attending to us. Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal til we had to stop someone and ask for a refill. Next our server attended to the people to the right of us, skipped over to the left of us and finally I was frustrated and made eye contact til he finally came over to us and checked on us. After that the group to the right of us interrupted us while I was asking for something and he walked away to attend them! He also interrupted us in the middle of our meal to ask if we're done, keep in mind we started way after the people around us, felt as if we were being pushed out.   Got to the end of our meal and my girlfriend and I wanted to take our food home because we were full. We had A LOT leftover and the server came to us and only brought 1 container and said they don't have anymore. I was upset because not only did they not have anymore containers for myself to take home the extra amount of food I'm paying for and had leftover, he said to us \"You guys should try and finish it.\" ARE YOU SERIOUS? How are you going to tell a customer to finish their food because YOU'RE out of containers? Let alone he told us multiple times to try and finish it?! The nice hostess again stepped in, ran to another restaurant and helped me. After all this, one of the chefs in the kitchen they have opened to the customers eye's to see, I saw him staring at us like we were ridiculous and laughed. He was the white chef with glasses. I also heard him clearly joking around with his coworkers about how we made them run around to get us stuff for our leftover food. SMFH. I was highly pissed off at this point.   I feel horrible ever writing a post like this and I barely ever do but my girlfriend and I were highly disrespected here. I worked and managed restaurants and kitchens as well as have my own business. I know what customer service should be.",

    "text": "Even though eating this kind of thing in the middle of summer is as strange as having a popsicle in a snowstorm to me, the fragrant scent of boiled meats and other delights coming out of the kitchen squashed any of those concerns upon entering.  I walked to the table as quickly as possible to dive into it all.    The excellent ingredients and presentation totally take this place to the next level.  Their beef and lamb combo platter was sliced red meat pornography and tasted even better with their vast array of sauces (the BBQ one seemed most popular).  The seafood combo platter packed with shrimp, scallop, octopus, squid, and mussels with its dry ice center garnered the \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" it was looking for.  Even the people at a neighboring table came over to snap pics.  We also ordered the meatballs, live scallops (huge!) and the short rib; all top notch.   My only real gripe is with the menu itself.  There are a lot of options and it could be daunting for first timers to the restaurant, let alone this type of dining experience as a whole.  It's probably even more annoying for staff since they have to constantly answer questions that could easily be clarified on the menu, like portion size.  To save everyone time, offering combo meals for 2, 4, and 6 people with a little bit of everything should be considered.  - While a cool novelty, the conveyer belt will go ignored unless dining solo or if you're the only one yearning for a plate of blood tofu or cuttlefish.  We ordered a lot and it was more than enough.  It isn't important or as fun to sit by as I thought it would be.      - Dipping high quality beef into boiling water is never worth it.  Avoid the \"Kobe\".  - I really want to go spicy next time!  - Can we PLEASE STOP calling this fondue?  4.4888888889 stars",

But still very good, however if you really want the True meat taste I'd just go with the original broth. They brought in geo duck (giant clam) for Mother's Day and it was amazing, so fresh  and such a good price as well! Will always come back here!",

Got medium spicy broth and it was awesome...... I love spicy food and this hit the spot.... They have other broths for people who don't like spicy food... The idea of a conveyor with color-coded plates with ingredients for pricing is also smart... Don't be afraid to try stuff as they ave vegetables, fish, tendon, noodles, and duck feet too. Just like the terminator.... I'll be back !!!",

    "text": "Interesting take on hot pot dining which ended up in unexpected pig out. I definitely felt chubby when I struggled to get up from the chair to leave. Good food and service made this experience a memorable one.  We sat at their bar tables with conveyor belt around which offers small hot pot items like mushroom, tofu and cabbage. I noticed that most people order with the servers and not picking off of the conveyor belt. It seemed more like a display. I hope those items are not spinning around for days and weeks.   Simple concept. Choose your soup, sauce then meat/veggies. I got to try their original soup base and tomato soup but have to say tomato soup is a lot better. As for sauces, you can either order one off of menu ($2 each) or walk over to their sauce station and grab your own. If ordering a sauce, I recommend their original sauce. If are going to the sauce station, I recommend mixing the soy bean sauce with green onion and spoonful of garlic. More garlic the better. I overloaded mine with 2 spoonful of garlic and it was a bit excessive...ha  As for meat, I must say their beef tongue was off the hook. It was the perfect slice, not too thin nor thick. You are eating the meat shabu-shabu style so you don't feel heavy or bloated after eating, which can be good or bad.   Skewers were good also. We got the lamb and beef. Lamb didn't have that strong gamy taste. Both were tender and not chewy at all. Servers couldn't tell the difference which was kind of funny. \"I got lamb and beef here. I can't tell the difference but you will know once you eat it\".   Talking about service, you can tell they are new and trying hard. Our server constantly checked on us and gave some recommendation, though his face was way too close to my face (so close his facial hair brushed a few times on my cheek which made me flinch every time). Training should focus on menu knowledge as he didn't know what was included in the combo or the difference between certain items on the menu.   Is it all a hype? Not really. Cool concept and good quality food served here. I can see myself coming back here again.",

All the ingredients are really fresh, i love its lamb shoulder especially. it is so tender and fresh. tried it black cod it is extremely fresh. i am usually super picky when it comes to seafood bc i care so much about its freshness. i gave five star for its freshness. it has great variety menu items to choose from. i love its entry level to hell soup base, it is actually really spicy already not sure if i would be able to handle the regular spicy level.  this place soup place is similar to little lamb magnolia but better.    I would definitely come back again! and the price is reasonable considering it is in Vegas",

We were kept waiting while you were serving the older people that came after us. They got their broth before us. When we were walking out you dont thank us, smile at us while i was smiling to you. The first thing she did was head straight to the table to check the tip, which now all makes sense. My friends felt bad so they gave her extra, and she just grab it and walk away.  Went on to yelp to read reviews and wow, this is a routine all the people who work here do. Man, great way to lose customers. Too bad for the store owner, i like the food here, was wanting to come back next day to spend another 150 cause food was well worth it, but now your waitress got her extra 10 tip, and you lost a new loyal customer haha.

    "text": "Visited on Saturday 8-20-16 at 5:30 pm.  We were asked if we'd like individual hot pots or a communal one and we chose the communal pot.    The process is easy...pick what type of broth you want, then order your raw items to throw in it, and you can pick up more items from the conveyor belt if you're sitting close to it.    For $75.28 we got a yin-yang pot of broth, a small order of enoki mushrooms, grilled shrimp, grilled chicken gizzards, fresh thick noodles, napa cabbage, hand-cut angus beef, beef meatballs, steamed rice, pork dumplings, chicken breast slices, three soft drinks, scallops, sausage, salmon, and crab sticks.   After ordering we were urged to check out the condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant.  It's a circular table with pots of seasonings and sauces and everything was labeled but the writing had faded off of the labels so it was impossible to tell what was inside.  After peeking inside all the containers I chose a spoonful of an unknown brown goo that turned out to be quite tasty.    They were out of a few items we wanted to order like the wagyu fried rice, duck flippers, and the server didn't even know what the pumpkin cake was even though it's on their menu.  They are still pretty new and trying to get the hang of things I guess.    Grilled chicken gizzard skewers were tasty! They were a little spicy but tender and yummy. The \"grilled shrimp skewer\" from their menu was just 6 grilled shrimp on a plate. No skewer LOL weird!   Items coming down the conveyor belt are not labeled and I couldn't really tell what all of them were.  There were a few items that looked like they were fried balls or dumplings but the case is refrigerated so that didn't really make sense.   We chose half house broth and half tomato broth.  I didn't really like either one...neither was salty enough and they were both very...herbal?? Like a pho broth but thicker and pungent.  All of the items we ordered appeared fresh but none were presented in cool containers like I see in other pictures on yelp and their website.  I think you have to order one of their more expensive \"combos\" to get the neat presentations with the dry ice and dish gardens.    This place is definitely worth the trip and I really enjoyed my first hot pot experience here.  The decor is awesome as well and I love love love their light fixtures and modern tables.",

    "text": "Chubby Cattle, I really wanted to like you. I have been waiting for you to open for ages. Ever since I heard wind of \"Little Lamb\" opening and that it is a similar concept to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, I had been ecstatic.   Chubby Cattle has a very interesting concept when it comes to hot pot. For half of their tables, everyone at the table gets their own individual pot. The other half gets a shared pot for those who don't mind. On top of that, they have a conveyor belt for certain hot pot items that you can grab. The items are on different colored plates that differentiate the cost of each item. Just keep in mind that meats and a majority of the seafood items won't be on the conveyor belt.   My friends and I came here last night for dinner. When we first got in, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to ask if we have reservations. Her question threw me off because I have never been to a hot pot place where they asked for reservations. She then told us that she could seat us but it would be shared pot and it will not be by the conveyor belt.   We want to be able to experience the conveyor belt and we told the hostess that. Instead of giving me an estimated time, she just gave me negative statements such as, \"I just can't sit you there right now. I have a reservation coming in at 7:15, 7:30, etc. I just can't.\" Well, that's great. Why do I care about what reservations you have coming? She eventually told us that it'll be a 45-60 min wait. She said she'd call us if the table was ready early or we can come back in an hour. Sure enough we came back in an hour and when she saw us, she told me, \"I tried calling you but it didn't work.\" I was really tempted to say, \"Well, did you dial 1 first?\" Without another word, she walked off. So, the hostess is unprofessional, not personable, overwhelmed, and doesn't know how to use a phone.   When we got seated, the table wasn't completely set up. Why? Because the hostess sat us without taking that into mind. It took a while before we got to order our soup bases and when we did, our server told us they were out of their original and original spicy. Well, why am I here then? I almost walked out but the manager came up to inform the server that if we were willing to wait 10 minutes, then the original and original spicy would be ready. And of course we opted to wait. In the end, I ended up with their original spicy soup base at medium. It was pretty bland in flavor. The soup tasted like spicy water that smelled like spicy herbs.   When we looked through the menu, we were a little curious about some of the dishes. There were single dishes and then there were combo dishes. We wanted to know the differences between them -- like, what is the better bang for our buck. We asked our server and he knew nothing. The manager had to come over to explain. Even then, according to the server, the beef & lamb combo platter, they don't serve the dishes by weight. The kitchen just does the best that they can to fill the plate up. So if I knew someone who worked in the kitchen, I can get a hook up right? We ended up ordering a plate of beef brisket and lamb shoulder. The quality of the beef brisket wasn't that great but the lamb shoulder slices were decent.  Aside from the meats, we also ordered napa cabbage and watercress. The napa was fine but the watercress wasn't fresh at all. A lot of yellow and browns on the leaves. We also ordered their fresh thick noodle and when I was ordering it, the server suggested the noodle combo. Of course, being curious, I asked what's in the noodle combo. He told me it was random and the kitchen decides on that. Well then, why am I ordering from a server? Should I just order from the kitchen directly? Maybe they'll know more about what's being served to me. On that topic, the fresh thick noodles were not fresh -- they were dry. They were also not thick, they were thin. They were thinner than spaghetti noodles. The texture of it was really good though and tasted great when cooked in the spicy soup base. I just wish they were thicker.   From the conveyor belt, we got some king oyster mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and glass noodles. They were pretty okay but we also noticed that a lot of the plates were not consistent in the amounts. Some plates looked like they had more product than the next even when it's the exact same item.   Our server did apologize for his performance. It was his third day on the job and he was overwhelmed and his knowledge was limited. I'm not sure if that's the greatest excuse but I do appreciate the apology though.   Bottom line, I'm not sure if I would return. The establishment has a great outward appearance to everything they do: conveyor belt, presentation of their seafood plates, table set up, etc. But the service wasn't great from square one and the quality of certain items were only average unless you spend a lot more. I've experienced better in general. The conveyor belt was a fun experience though! Was worth it just once.",

Don't get me wrong the concept is great and there's nothing else like it in Vegas so I definitely recommend giving at least one try, but I don't think I'd come back.    About 5 of my friends came on a Thursday for dinner. We had made a reservation so had no problems with getting a table. The server was very good with welcoming us and giving a brief explanation of everything, but during our meal she wasn't super attentive with clearing plates or refilling our drinks. Maybe they're just overwhelmed by still being a new restaurant, but it definitely effected my overall experience.  Food wise it wasn't bad, but I honestly prefer doing hot pot at home better. I do love that they have tons of sides and meat choices and that you can get your own individual pot. As a group we definitely ordered too much food so I recommend starting with a few items and ordering as you go. For the broth I went with the spicy entry level. I personally did not really care for it. My boyfriend had the mushroom which I tried and thought was much better. I did enjoy the concept of being able to mix your own sauces, but wish they had some type of guidelines of what to mix or just some basics.   Overall I'm glad I tried this place out and think it's still a great one time thing, but I'd rather do my own hot pot at home.",

The soup will set you back a few bucks but it's worth it.  They have a sauce and a small appetizer bar at no cost which is a nice touch. Everything else here is a-la-carte,  I would opt out their certified Waygu grade 5 steak and stick with their beef and lamb offering. Their seafood was ok but not something you should go out of your way to try. They offer a few variety of \"balls\" so if you had to choose one, pick the fresh fish ball; the other variations didn't work.  They do have a sushi type carousal but I didn't see any price charts for the different color plates.   As usual expect yourself to smell like what you ate..",

Right when we sat down clearly explained the menu, made recommendations, checked in regularly and can I say what a great voice for singing Happy birthday to my mom! Not just once but 3 times! Lol (long story). I hope you are reading this because you're so awesome Deni! And I hope my fellow yelpers see this and request for you.    Food was so good. Our party ordered literally all the different soups so we can share. My favorite is the Oxtail with spicy sauce. So spicy but I'm Thai so it's a necessity. Ordered the combination of everything, beef, veggies, seafood and all were delicious. I cannot wait to go back and see my fave.",

NOTE: If you work at a casino you get a buy one get one free on the meats you order, and you're not limited to just one order so feel free to order away if you're starving (though the portions are big) or if you have a big group. This is a hotpot place and is very clean. What I really love is that there is a conveyer belt with side dishes going around that you can grab and add to your hotpot. What's always amazing is that there is a sauce bar and you can make your very own sauce to dip your food in. If you like spicy like me, here's my signature sauce creation. 2 scoops of spicy garlic hot oil, 1 scoop of soy sauce, half a scoop of bean paste to round out the flavors, and a small amount of green onion and cilantro. The food is great, the service is great, I always come here when my family and I decide to go out to eat.  Update: There is no longer a buy one get one free anymore but rather a gift card of where you spend X amount and get a portion off your next meal.",

Their dumplings were delicious, and they had lots of types of noodles. If you like hot pot but also want to shake things up or feel more fancy, this is the place to go. They also had yummy cocktails as well as soju, so we left happily tipsy. Overall, it was a great experience.",

    "text": "I didn't get the chance to eat here but we wasted more than an hour in this establishment. I called the restaurant asking how long the wait was for four people and David replied 40 minutes. I asked if I could put my name down as we were coming from the hotel, and he happily noted yes and I got a text confirmation. When we got to the restaurant about 20 minutes later, we checked in and he noted that the wait was about 40 minutes... I didn't understand how the wait did not go down since it had already been 20 minutes. We waited for another 20 minutes and he was not able to give us a time estimate. He noted 40 minutes.. I may not be a mathematician but 20 plus 20 plus 40 minutes is not close to the original wait time of 40 minutes...  The staff is a joke. There were 3 girls there trying to help and all they decided to do was look at their system and then give an extremely random time estimate. There were multiple parties ahead of us- one party waited for almost two hours when the original wait time was an hour. A few other parties had reservations and were still waiting. David was too busy fixing his Santa hat and taking selfies and snaps of himself in the restaurant instead of helping the guests that were there.  We were a party of four and there were two sets of tables with four openings and no one decided to seat any parties. We let them know and then they went back to their computer system to see if it would magically tell them what to do. It obviously didn't.   Please figure out how to service your customers as currently, it's a disaster.",

After being cooked in the hot pot pretty much all the meat comes out tasting the same.  It is a good flavor but for a whole meal it leaves me a bit unsatisfied.  The sauce bar can help a bit but I'm no cook and some times the sauce I end up mixing together just isn't very good.  I'd prefer at least some pre-mixed ready to eat options.  Lastly the price never seems to match my enjoyment.  Maybe I'm just not the hot pot type...",

    "text": "Ugh, I had such high hopes for this place, but my coworkers and I agreed that we wouldn't go back. We went around 9:30pm on a Thursday night for their buy one get one free happy hour. Even with this, my bill came out to be around $16. I got the tomato broth, beef brisket, enoki mushrooms, another type of mushroom, tripe, and jelly noodles (ju luo). Maybe I think it's so expensive because I'm used to eating 5x more food at AYCEs for $25.  Another reviewer recommended the tomato broth ($4.99), so that's what I got. I hated it. It tasted like tomato paste from a can and was really salty. My coworker got the original broth and I liked that much much better.   For the meat option, I got the beef brisket ($5.99). It was the cheapest option on the menu, but it was still tasty. Came with about 7 slices. The beef here is definitely the star of the meal, with wagyu/kobe options. Honestly, if I were to ever come again, I'd just splurge on the combo and skip all the other stuff.   The 2 mushrooms were $1.99 each, jelly noodles $2.99 and tripe $3.59 (pre-happy hour discount). SO expensive. I also really wanted the chrysanthemum greens, but they were $2.99 for a single serving. At the Chinese market, you can get enough chrysanthemum greens for 10 people at that price. I definitely wouldn't come without the happy hour discount. I'd only come if you weren't that hungry. If you're really hungry, go to an all you can eat.   The conveyor belt was really limited in options. They didn't have qual eggs or a variety of fish/meat balls. It also didn't really look that fresh. Maybe it was basically it was late on a slow night.  I will say that the service was really good. The waiter refilled our waters, got us beers and even split our bill for us, which was much appreciated.",

We were a party of 6 adults, plus an infant and a toddler, so we ordered several combination platters: seafood, beef, veggie, noodle, mushrooms, etc. We chose their house (original) broth, oxtail broth, and spicy broth in our shareable family-style hot pot. The food presentation was lovely and service from our main server, Deni, was impeccable--he went above and to make sure our large party was served within a reasonable amount of time and always checked on us to make sure everything was going smoothly. Will definitely return and recommend to all our family and friends!",

The quality  of food was amazing.   The experience at chubby cattle was made even more amazing because of our wonderful server, Kwan.  Kwan was extremely informative and very attentive.

Since everyone else has already reviewed this place in detail, there's not much for me to add.   However, I suggest going there Sunday thru Thursday, when there are 2 for 1 specials, and specials on the conveyer belt ingredients for your \"hot pot\" meals, but again beware; you need to be a Student with an ID Card, or in the ACTIVE Military.   The only reason I \"lowered them\" to 3 Stars is they are a little pricey, and very stingy offering promotions. So, beware, this place will most probably cost more than a really good \"all you can eat\" sushi place. At least most Sushi places give you a \"comp\" meal after 10 purchases.   Quality is very good, but don't go here looking for a Chinese food bargain. As I have warned, though it's good food, your wallet probably won't like the check.",

You can blend spices and sauces to enjoy with your meal.  I recommend getting the giant basket of mushrooms with any hot pot to share with the table. I went with my gma and husband and we all got different broths and just ordered a bunch of different stuff for the table to share. It was priced very fairly.  Only bad thing was the kobe beef was very expensive and the quality was not nearly as good as the basic, inexpensive beef.",

Our server Kwan was outstanding.  He was our tour guide offering suggestions and explaining the food, extremely personable and great sense of humor.  We had a great table by the conveyor belt and selected a wide range based on the tables preferences including seafood, vegetables, and meat.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  Two of us had the mushroom broth and one had the tomato which were all good flavor and a healthy alternative.  They also have a variety of sauces at a sauce bar to accent your food.  We finished dinner with a blueberry and mango cakes which were equally amazing.  Overall, great service and exceptional value, along with a very contemporary setting that is a welcome addition to our local  restaurants.  Great for vegans, pescatarians and carnivores!",

My friend and I ordered the beef combo, beef brisket, and small juicy beef balls. Good quality, fast and definitely yummy. The beef balls are made in-house so you can taste the difference of quality and believe it when they say juicy! Soup kinda squirted out when I was eating it. They also have $1 noodles and I believe it's one order per person; also made in-house. Sauce bar was awesome with a variety of goodies and also small side dishes. I will definitely come back if I'm craving for hot pot again in Vegas!",

The oxtail soup base was great (though it's a shame individual pots can't have split soup bases!) The wagyu and rib eye were amazing. One of our party ordered the kobe and it was so good, his eyes rolled into his head when he ate his first bite.  I called about an hour ahead needing last minute tables for a very large party. We were able to get two rooms with three tables and the staff was very nice, polite, and accommodating!  Most of my large group had never seen hot pot before - none were disappointed and I'm still getting \"thank you's\" for taking them here :)  Thank you for a great meal and happy friends!",

I really like how they have their own sauce station to create your own sauces for your meat and I enjoy how lovely the servers were. We were able to do a split pot for two different choices of broth for our base. A lot of good small dishes and great choices of meat. They had a conveyer belt and also great birthday song themes. I would like to come back again to try more things. The only thing I personally found funny was how there were cattle and cows all over the place as I was eating meat. I couldn't stop staring at it lol.",

VEGAN SURVIVAL GUIDE: - Try to block out the name of this place from your mind. - Get a table in the back away from the live seafood butchering area. - Ask for a two broth combo: half Tomato broth, half Mushroom broth. These are completely vegan. - Get a veggie basket, a mushroom basket, some tofu (soft or fried) or tofu skins. - We tried the green tea noodles & they were bomb. A+ - At the sauce station, stick to a mix of soy sauce, green onions, and garlic. Optionally, add chile. Dunno if other sauces were veg. - Since you are preparing your own food from baskets, you can control a lot & rid your mind of the dreaded meat cross contamination worries. - Get the hot jasmine green tea.  It comes in an adorable serving pot. Sooo warming.  All in all, it was a fun, yummy, toasty way to spend an evening.",

The fresh ingredients in the both made a big difference. We ordered the beef combo which was sliced right in the back. The meat was not frozen like most places in back ( Boston.) They have a sauce bar where you can mix and match different ingredients to your taste. The conveyor belt had different color plates for different prices. The staff explained everything to us. The service was good and price was pricy because we had alot of color plates. I would come back here and suggested anyone in town to come here.",

Our waitress was very helpful with giving us recommendations to us since we were newbies.  Food: house original soup base and tomato oxtail soup base. Beef combo Vegetable combo Teriyaki bowl Everything was delicious ok tail was super tender. Both soup bases were not salty at all.  Waiters were on point making sure we had soup and water at all times. They made sure our table was constantly cleaned.  Overall best experience!! Prices were reasonable and staff was the best!!

    "text": "First time in, on a Saturday night, with a party of ten people.  I was excited to try this place. We were looking for some good hotpot, and this place lived up to even my unrealistic expectations.  Pretty straightforward. It is NOT \"all you can eat\" so you pay per item. This is fine though, because it seems that the quality of meat is usually better when it's not AYCE. With larger parties, they said they only had the option of individual hotpots, which worked out just fine. They also recommended that we get different meat and veggie combo platters to share with the table. This also turned out to be a great option for sharing so everyone could try something different.  Since I don't eat pork, I always tend to go for the vegetarian soup base option at places like this. Most of their soup bases are made from a beef & pork mixed broth, including their House and Hellishly Spicy. So I couldn't try those. But they did have an Oxtail base, which was all beef, and two vegetarian options (Mushroom and Tomato). I tried the mushroom pot and it was about as tasty as you could expect. I got great feedback from the table that all the different bases were spiced well and added good flavor. The Hellishly Spicy pot came in level 6, 12, and 18 (essentially mild, medium, and hot). To put it in perspective, my fiance is Vietnamese and can handle really spicy stuff (more than me), but the level 12 (medium) was a little much for her.  We shared the beef combo, which consisted of brisket, ribeye, and Japanese wagyu. This was a great option for two slightly hungry people to share, if you plan to add veggies.  If you're both pretty hungry, you may need a little more. We got the large udon noodles that were supposedly good for two people, but we found ourselves ordering a second one. Some of the table added lamb, shrimp, the veggie combo and mushroom basket.   The sauce station was good, though they regularly ran out of the small bowls, and we had to ask for them a few times. I mixed the ponzu with some chili paste and fresh green onions, and this was a delicious addition to the dish.   For everyone, the bill was about $350 after tax and tip. About $35 per person, which is comparable to AYCE anyway. Not bad.   Service was decent. It was a very busy night, so I can't fault them completely, but it did seem like they were a little irritated when we asked questions or needed things.  As expected in most of the Chinatown plazas on a Friday or Saturday, parking was a nightmare. I would recommend getting here at least 10-15 minutes early to make your reservation.   Overall four stars. It was definitely above average.",

They have a system that notifies their guests via SMS regarding how long the wait time is. After we waited, we were seated and our server, Matthew, greeted us right away. Throughout our experience, Matthew was courteous and attentive. In fact, everyone on staff was hospitable. The dining experience, overall, was fun and the food was pretty good. I loved their array of veggies and sides on the conveyor belt. I can't wait to come back. :)",

    "text": "Cute little place that just opened up a few weeks ago. We decided to come here last minute for a nice dinner night and were greeted with a wait time of about 20 minutes. I can definitely see this place go up to 1-1.5hr wait times after the word gets out on this place, especially on weekend nights. Make a reservation if you could!   If you want to spend a leg and an arm, you should definitely check out Chubby Cattle! It's clean, new and the \"restaurant\" that everyone is talking about these days. Unfortunately, we had a mixed review about this place. First of all, we didn't order a dish and another server delivered it to our desk and got frustrated when we said it wasn't ours. Our original server came to check on us and he apologized profusely for the mistake. The other server just walked away with attitude and mumbled something in Chinese back to the kitchen. I wasn't uncomfortable with that.   Again, this is a Asian restaurant so I knew I had to expect sometime of stereotypical service, right? After we got our broth, my partner's heater didn't turn on and struggled to heat up for at least 15-20 minutes. No, I'm seriously not exaggerating. I felt so bad because he had to wait for his soup to boil. He couldn't use mines because he didn't like spicy. Poor guy.   For our main dishes, we got the beef and lamb combo for each of us and a bowl of mushrooms to share. We sat across from the conveyer belt too and it was fun to pick and choose bowls to eat. This was awesome since I grabbed a lot of the seafood dishes from here, which were amazing by the way!  Overall, this place was an interesting experience to check out. Aside from the rude interaction with one of the servers, the rest of the staff was super accommodating and friendly. The place was relatively clean too. Unfortunately, I wouldn't really come back here since I felt like the place was a bit overpriced.",

    "text": "This is a one-of-a-kind experience in Vegas! I appreciate that it's not on the strip, which is good for locals. My first visit here was also my first hot pot experience. What I liked the most was that they have individual pots in the larger tables for large parties, while smaller parties can opt for the smaller tables with a shared pot.  The conveyor belt probably steals the show. Each plate on the belt is color-coded, which is priced according to the chart. In my experience, however, you'd get a better deal ordering a combo or two from the menu. For example, go for the beef combo and vegetable combo (feeds 2 adults nicely), which both come in a variety of meats and veggies, eliminating the need to take from the conveyor belt. I also recommend ordering a seafood combo and an order of your favorite noodles.  After putting in your order, go up to the sauce table in the middle of the room and take several bowls of various sauces to go with your pot. My Chinese friend chose the sesame sauce for dipping her meats in, which she said is how it's done in China. I went for sesame oil, garlic, and green onions in one bowl, and oyster sauce in another. Very delicious!  I ordered the original broth, which was well-seasoned with many spices (not spicy). I tasted my friend's Hell pot (medium); it was super spicy for me. One sip and my mouth was burning! I don't really eat spicy food and even after the server said the medium was similar to the spice level of hot Cheetos (which is probably the only spicy food I love), it was definitely a notch or two spicier. But if you love to torture your mouth, go for the spiciest one! I'm sure it's delicious.  The meats and veggies were yummy and very nicely-presented on the plates. Everything looked so good, including the interior finishes. I especially liked the pictures of cattle hanging from the ceiling. What better way to enjoy beef!?",

Their chef recommendation for the beef was nice and juicy. The seafood platter was beautiful!!! The ambience is nice with their cute decorations.  Deni was our waiter and he broke everything down for us. Thank you again!   Overall it was a good experience and I'd recommend it. (:",

I went around 8pm on a Thursday and all the spots where the conveyor belts were taken so we were sat at the high bar. At first it was awkward because we were sitting with strangers but then it got comfortable after discussing what their favorites were  The service was exceptional. Our server explained to us the entire menu and his favorites which makes it easier for us to chose since we can be indecisive at times.   I got the mushroom broth and ordered a variety of meats including the meat combo plate, cuttlefish balls and house meatballs. Enoki mushroom was delicious and the MUST HAVE game changer was the lamb skewer. I would go back and order 10 of those skewers. It was so juicy. And please do get the beef tongue - literally melts in your mouth.   Also, in the center of the restaurant is a table with a bunch of different dipping sauces. Don't get the peanut butter sauce- it's definitely not like the peanut sauce you dip your spring rolls in. Do get the minced garlic and add that to your broth.   The complimentary moon cake at the end was a nice touch.",

The outside of the restaurant is simple but when you walk in the ambiance embraces you. Fun atmosphere with good music.  You get your own individual hot pot or you can have a shared one. They even have a happy hour for the revolving belt of meat, veggies and noodles. There is also a bar full of different sauces where you can happily make your own concoctions.   First you chose your broth and I chose hellishly spicy broth $5.99. Then I chose the entry level and with Seafood Combo platter $19.99. It was pretty spicy. The food came out beautifully on a boat and the seafood was definitely top quality, tender, and completely worth the price. I loved it.  My bf got the Tomato oxtail broth $6.99 with Beef combo $18.99. Very flavorful broth. From the conveyor beth we had a bread type dish. For desert we had Milk crepe cake with strawberry flavor $5.99. Total $64.89 not bad at all.  Our waiter Kwan is attentive and friendly.",

They have a pretty extensive menu with several different combinations as well as regular entrees.  We ordered the original pork broth with had a lot of herbs and the tomato oxtail broth.  Both were delicious although the oxtail one had obviously lots more flavor.  Since we were 5 people, we ordered the beef combination, seafood combination, vegetable combination, noodle combination, udon noodles, pork belly and rice.   Everything was great although the vegetable combination was not my favorite.  I like bok choy and it was not enough, but we still had a lot if greens left over.  The coconut mojito is pretty good and I don't even like coconut but it's the most popular so decided to give it a try.   While you wait for your broth and order, go to the sauce bar.  They have some recommendations for good sauce combinations if you don't want to be adventurous.   Now for the conveyor belt.  What a cool concept.  After you order your broth and you want something else, you have options that pass your table on a conveyor belt.   They just charge you by the plate.  Food was so delicious.  It's weird how full you can get.      Downside is parking, it's awful, small parking spaces and completely full.  Went around several times before finding a spot.    Didn't take credit card although didn't see anything that said cash only.   Maybe their machines was down since they gave us 10% off.",

I started with the water melon juice which is fresh and delicious thanks to Angela's recommendation   I was blessed to get Angela as my server but before she even got here I stopped one of the bussers Che who stopped and helped me pick out my Glass noodles but when Kevin saw me asking questions he didn't hesitate to take the time to come over and help me pick out our meat choice which was The Beef combo   We sat family style with two types of brother went with house original and house hellish spicy pot and boy was it spicy but sooo delicious   Once Angela got back she also helped me get some potatoes and bok Choy.. she suggested I go with a sea food choice I asked about shrimp and she hooked it up with tiger shrimp and advised I peel it first before dipping it in ..  Once the beef combo arrived Kevin took the time to show us how to cook it which was super sweet but I almost passed out cause I didn't get a pick first before I dropped it in ..   Our food was all super delicious but we wanted to try the conveyor so we did the fried tofu aka Chinese donut  Once done we had left overs and they boxed me up .. a trainee named Rong took time to explain how it all worked   I also got set up with their membership by Bin   I can't wait to come back and try more options with more people",

It lets you see the hot pot options before you select them.  So many options constantly rolling by.  Love it.  2. The sauce bar!  This probably pushed my review from four stars to five. So many options to create a custom sauce that works for whatever you are cooking. I personally made four or five different sauces and really love them all.  We started with The house original pot and hellishly spicy pot (medium - plenty of spice for me) as our soup bases.  We ordered the premium lamb, prime beef short rib, tiger shrimp, veggie combo and mixed mushroom basket.  The veggie combo was just a bunch of different lettuces/cabbage which I would skip in the future and order the specific vegetables I want. However, the mix mushroom basket was well worth the money As were the meats we selected.  It would be nice to have a bigger beer and sake selection, but that would not stop me from returning.  Great food and value away from the tourist traps on the strip.",

I really hope they put the vegan menu together soon! I'd be in there once a week if they do! They have two vegan broths: mushroom and tomato. My husband and I both opted for the mushroom, which did not disappoint! It was packed with enoki, shiitake, beech and others! We got a ton of veggies, tofu and noodles and everything was fantastic.  Some highlights: fresh handmade udon, potato (don't sleep on this!), napa cabbage, winter melon, tofu skin and sponge tofu!  Now for my vegan Yelpers, they were so knowledgeable and happy to help us pick the perfect stuff! None of their noodles have egg or dairy in them! Fantastic sauce bar had tons of options to make a super tasty vegan sauce.  Lastly, our server Kwan was an absolute sweetheart! So kind and patient with us as it was our first time and we had dietary restrictions. WHEN (not if) we go back, we'll request his section for sure!",

I had the  beautiful tomato pot It was flavorful with tomatoes, ginger, oxtail.. My husband got the house original pot.   We ordered the ribeye, shrimp, pork meatball and dumplings to be cooked in the broths. They also had a special wagyu only used in their Chinatown location-to die for.   I love noodles so I got a small order of fresh tomato noodles. So slurpy good.   You get to make your own dipping sauces from a cool set of yummy ingredients like chili sauce, special mushroom sauce, peanut, soy...  In addition there are items like fish balls, oysters, vegetables that go along a conveyer belt.   The drinks looked great too a dreamy peach, monitor, coconut water in the coconut, watermelon juice...  This is a special authentic place with yummy food and great staff.   A shout out to Angela who made our dining experience fun. She was very friendly yet professional. Service was great and the food came out in a timely manner.   In addition they were filming the show \"no passport required\" with Marcus Samuelson-how fun to see a little peek of that.",

I went here with my girlfriend last weekend and to my surprise it wasn't so packed, the wait was only about 20 minutes.    The way it works is simple: choose your broth, choose your meat/seafood/sides, make your sauce, cook your food, enjoy!    My girlfriend got the House Hellishly Spicy Pot (Hottest One), and I got the same thing but with a medium level of spice.  Both tasted so good.  We ordered plenty of meat to go with our meal as well as udon and napa cabbage.  There's a self-service sauce bar where they have instructions on making the sauces or you can come up with a creation of your own.  Everything tasted so good.    There's also a conveyor belt that is located in the middle of the restaurant that has other food that you can grab and cook as well.  We didn't take any of them but it sure looks cool!  Parking is a real PITA on the weekends.  The plaza has other popular businesses which gets the parking lot full real quick.  I've seen times where people have parked across the street and j-walked.  Go here.  It's worth the wait and the hassle of parking :).",

I only knew it as this \"Mongolian Hot Pot\" place that was getting talked about on Yelp and in foodie circles - until I finally went on the night of what was actually considered a grand reopening of sorts.  I was able to join a group of Yelp buddies to try out this Chinese take on hot pot, which differs from the common Japanese shabu shabu locally and the Vietnamese hot pot that accounts for most of my experience in this type of cooking. We eventually got seated at tables with support for individual hot pot support. This allows everyone to have their own choice of broth and to eat at their own pace. I find it more equitable than potentially having one person cook for the time, and more reasonable than the somewhat frenzied rush that I've seen in situations with one huge shared pot. Plus, you can still exchange tastes of different broths with your tablemates if you're so inclined.  Oxtail Soup Base ($6.99): interestingly, everybody at my table wanted to try what appears to be a new option, rather than their established and loved options such as original, tomato, or mushroom. I couldn't say that that the oxtail broth bestowed really distinctive flavors like a tomato broth might have, but it definitely added meatiness and was properly seasoned, the latter of which is essential because it's the vehicle for cooking everything else.  Beef Combo ($18.99, 13 oz): brisket, ribeye, Japanese Wagyu. I was advised that it was hard to discern differences between the thinly-sliced meats while eating, but I definitely tasted the rich marbling and tenderness wagyu before I realized what I was enjoying, and the ribeye was also enjoyable. The brisket is definitely tender and flavorful enough on its own and would be a reasonable budget option. These all cooked up quickly in the hot pot, so I was really just submerging them for a few seconds before pulling them out with some pinkness still visible.  Hand-cut Texas Dorper Sheep ($7.99, 5 oz): like the beef, thinly sliced. Unlike the beef, gamey flavor - but not all that gamier than lamb, although it was a slightly different quality. I definitely enjoyed it and would urge lamb-lovers to give this a try.  Mixed Mushroom Basket ($12.99): literally a basket of all of their mushroom options. I'm not so much of a mushroom connoisseur, so I could've been just as happy (and not so light-walleted) if I'd only picked up an order of enoki, but they were at least useful for texture and flavored my broth to the point that it tasted like mushroom soup by the time I was done with all the cooking and only had a little broth left to sip.  Veggie Combo Platter ($12.99) - couldn't exactly tell you which items are in here, but there were a few different leaves and herbs that add nuance and texture to your hot pot. This and the Mixed Mushroom Basket are probably best enjoyed with a larger group.  Green Tea Noodle ($3.99) - I wouldn't say that I tasted green tea, which tends to be a subtle flavor anyway, but the noodles tasted quite fresh. It's quite a small portion though, so you may need to grab double if you're hoping for a lot of noodle all the way until meal's end.  There is a sauce station in the middle of the restaurant floor where you can mix sauces and fresh components (especially green onion and cilantro) to your palate's pleasure. I was a bit unfamiliar with this, so I tried to follow their simple recipes which they suggested as pairings for beef (ponzu, green onions, and a little chili oil) and lamb (sesame sauce, sacha sauce, chili sauce) respectively. The beef sauce was pretty good, but I couldn't locate the sacha sauce for the lamb accompaniment and wound up throwing in soy sauce instead. I found myself not using the sauces at all about halfway through the meal though, because the combination of meats and broth were really that good.  Another note on the cooking: you'll want to adjust down your heat (ask a server if you can't figure it out) or else the water in your broth base will boil off too quickly, Play around with it and have fun.  I'd probably put Chubby Cattle at about 4.5 stars, but it's rather tough to imagine significantly better hot pot. The meats were very enjoyable from start to finish, the veggies were fresh, and the value was reasonable. I'll have to branch out to more meats and maybe even locate a seat near the conveyor belts next time, although that seems like a bit of an unnecessary gimmick in light of my excellent meal.",

    "text": "I had Chubby Cattle bookmarked for a while, and decided to visit when a friend was in town. We came before 6PM so it wasn't too busy yet. We had the choice of small or large hot pots, and we opted for small (i.e. individual) hot pots, as the hostess said that it was better value for a party of two since there was no minimum spending requirement. We were also able to secure a booth next to the conveyor belt. I wanted to try out the conveyor belt because it was such a novelty for a hot pot restaurant, though if you sit at a regular table, you can still order everything off the menu.  Prices are reasonable, though it's all a la carte, so things can add up quickly if you aren't keeping track. Portions are decent too, so value is not terrible.  The interior of the restaurant is very modern and eclectic. It's not all that big, and there is no time limit, so at peak dining times, there may be quite a wait.  There are five great broths to choose from, and I opted for oxtail. There is an excellent sauce bar, and some complimentary side dishes and dessert as well.  All of the main food is ordered a la carte, and everything aside from the meats and cooked items can be found on the refrigerated conveyor belt.  My friend and I ordered a few things to share, and greatly enjoyed all of the food and broths. Service was also outstanding, as we were checked on regularly and given napkins plus water/soup broth refills. Our waitress Xiao was very friendly!  The one small shortcoming was that the  (beef pie) we ordered took forever to arrive, we waited over forty minutes! They did apologize though, and they tasted quite good!  I look forward to returning in the future for some tasty hotpot! Maybe more so when the weather is cooler. ;)",

    "text": "Had to try this place with friends from out of town since we've never tried anything that had a conveyer belt before. When you first walked in it smelled of soup and seafood. It was quite busy when we came, but there were empty tables so we were into our booth fairly quickly. Our server took quite awhile to come say hi and ask us for our drinks. I don't eat shabu shabu very often so I wanted him to explain what we were supposed to do. Instead, he just dismissed me and said go pick up your sauce and look at the menu and I'll come back. So the entire table went to get the sauces they wanted and came back. Then we ordered our soup base I guess that's what he called it. He suggested not to order the spicy if we couldn't handle it and so I just got one that wasn't spicy.    It took 4 times of asking to actually get our drinks and he never came back to ask us if we had any questions or if we were doing okay. That's one part of the reason they got a 2 Star rating from me.   We had to figure out the whole conveyer belt thing on our own and asked several other workers what things were since our waiter was non existent. We managed to get through dinner without our waiter and the food was okay not the best shabu shabu I've had.   When we were finally done our waiter showed up to give us the bill. We asked two split it between two people and evenly between two cards. Easy enough right? Boy was this wrong! We all were so confused and saw he charged my card twice for the same amount. We wanted to make sure he never charged our friends card before we left and let him know he made a mistake if indeed he didn't charge the card.   So we waited for him and when he finally showed up he kept pestering me to take my card back so he could credit back what his mistake was and charge the other card instead. I at first kindly told him no that's fine. Then he kept insisting. That made me angry so I told him no again and said you might instead charge me a third time since you have already charged me twice and I don't want to deal with that hassle so let it be and just learn from your mistakes tonight. That's the second reason they got the two Star rating.",

(Think revolving sushi bar but the items are vegetables and other items for hot pot) I think it's an interesting concept to try to branch out utilizing the revolving aspect, but was kind of disappointed about each plate being a very different price. The wait for this restaurant, especially on a weekend night, was very very long.. over 1 hour wait time. Compared to the hot pot flavors and the items we have in California and the SGV area, I really don't think this place could really compete (even though it's not supposed to be compared). Some of the family-style shared tables are also very difficult to eat at -- we were a party of 6 that had to share one hot pot so basically the only people that were able to get the food they wanted were the two people in the middle. The 4 corner people had a rough time getting food.. :( There were other tables that had individual hot pots, but the wait time for those tables were even longer.. TL;DR: Ultimately, I think it was very expensive and not worth it especially if there's a long wait.",

Your experience starts out with the selection of the base pot liquid.  We elected the mild and a modified extra spicy pot.  They were capable of providing two liquids in one pot.  Once you select your base, you can visit the sauce bar to make up your own blends for enhancing your finished cooked items.  We selected thinly sliced lamb, beef short ribs, beef rib eye, mushrooms, seafood (Clams, Mussels, Tilapia and Scallops), noodles and veggies.  You place your foods in the hot pots and then strain them out for consumption.  When you attack your noodles, you place your noodles in a cup and ladle in the liquid from the hot pot.  Venture out from the strip this is a fun time with great food, presentation and all at a very good price.",

    "text": "Ok so the best way for me to describe this yummy yummy place is it's a hot pot/ Shabu shabu kind of style and if you want addition mix ins then you can order it or if you are seated by the conveyor belt then grab it.   You start with a base. I had the tomato. I highly recommend it. You can add noddles. I wanted to try them because they are freshly made. It was good. I could do with our without. The meat combo for $18.99 is a deal! You can't go wrong with rib eye brisket and wagyu.   Our server Xiao was the sweetest server. Can I just say that in general service was amazing. We mentioned it was a friends birthday and they were super friendly and had him choose an Easter egg for a birthday gift. He got a crepe cake which was bomb. It was the seasonal flavor of blueberry.   Overall I really enjoyed it. I would def go back because the broths are delicious. They have variety of sauces and selection for mix ins. There should be great options for any meat lover and first timers to hot pot. Next time seafood!",

The place has a conveyor displaying other food items that can go into your pot, like mushrooms, shrimp, and scallops. The service was really great and tentative! Our server, Mathew, made sure we didn't run out of soup and helped us with the cooking settings. They're really helpful here!  If you guys want to try something different, try this place out lol",

I love hot pot, but my sister didn't even know what hot pot was! She loved it! She is vegetarian, so she got the tomato-based broth and tofu -- and we got the mixed mushroom basket and baby bok choy to share. I am a meat-lover, so I got spicy broth with lamb and beef. The restaurant isn't called chubby cattle for nothing! The waguy beef was sooo good. The waitress Queeny was wonderful as well, she answered all our questions and was very knowledgeable about how long we should keep each item in the broth and whatnot. She gave us stellar recommendations when we were ordering. Thanks for the food!",

I thought it was really bland and their sauces did not go well with the kind of broth they offer. I was not really planning on coming back, but came back because a friend wanted to try it out. However, my second experience at Chubby Cattle was great. Igot house original broth both times I went, but this time the broth seemed more flavorful that I didnt even bother going to the sauce station. We got the beef and lamb combo. The meats were soft and tender as they should be. I wouldnt really recommend their lamb skewers since they were a little dry and tough, but I would definitely get beef skewers again when I go back next time. They were so tender and juicy.   Also, we loved our server Kwan! He was very friendly and knew well about the menu :) Yay!",

We both got the original soup base, which was hearty and filling. For the meats we had hand cut angus and ribeye, both of which were super soft and yummy. Selection of sides are a little on the limited side, but prices were reasonable, especially if you come during happy hour (buy one get one free sides). The meal comes with free ice cream. Get the chocolate. That stuff is bomb.   All in all, a good hot pot experience. Would recommend.",

The bbq oysters were cooked perfectly and had a nice mix of the ocean saltiness and garlic. The sauce bar lets your customize your own dipping sauce. I always like to do a random mix of flavor but there is a guide on the top of the bar to help you get a certain flavor. James was a wonderful server and took really good care of us. Made sure our broth pot stayed full. We will DEFINITELY be back again!",

    "text": "Chubby Cattle is a neat hot pot restaurant! It's so cool that they have a conveyer belt. I've only seen conveyer belts at sushi restaurants. The conveyer belt is convenient for those sitting at the booths and bar to grab anything. You can also order anything on the menu if it isn't on the conveyer belt, like meats. There is a sauce bar and they also provide recipes to compliment the meats. There's a bunch of different broths you can get, but they are known for their bone marrow broth. My favorite is the mushroom assortment! I usually get noodles, tofu, and a bunch of beef brisket. Especially with the enoki mushrooms. There's just a lot of different things you can order but you will not be disappointed. If it's your first time, they will gladly explain how it works too!",

For any sauces you want to try, you can help yourself at the sauce station. There are around 10+ sauces you can mix and match and it's great fun.  The meat comes out quickly and is sliced decadently thin. You have several options for the broth, and we opted for tomato and the house broth. The tomato broth was fabulous--savory with a kick, while the house broth was somewhat disappointing.   Interior--bright, cozy, comfy, modern. Service is excellent.",

Service was decent. Felt they could have checked up more often but overall, a chill vibe. They offer membership if you fill out a survey, and free ice cream if you give a Yelp review. (They request you give them five stars while standing over your shoulder so I don't know how legitimate all of these reviews are.) After all that, they'll also ask you to tag them on facebook.

I'm not even sure I would recommend it to friends to try out. Meh.   The food was good and everything but boy, your bill really adds up quickly and very sneakily. The restaurant is still quite busy so be prepared to wait if you come at peak dinner time or are just unlucky :P They have a conveyor belt options of items for hot pot or you can just order ala carte off the menu. From what I saw, most people order off the menu. A few people here and there would grab things from the belt, but not many.   You first order your broth, I opted for the mushroom broth but also tried the house broth. Then you start ordering everything you want to cook in your broth. I will say that their menu is very very extensive. From veggies to dumplings to noodles to all slices and cuts of meat, there will be something to tickle your fancy!  Everything tasted fine and I will say the food quality is there but nothing blew me out of the water. There is also a walk-up make your own sauce bar to mix and match your own flavors to make a dipping sauce.   Well to each their own on this one. I was left a little underwhelmed with a bigger hole in my wallet than I would think for hot pot.",

Heard great things from multiple people about Chubby Cattle and finally tried it today and it did not disappoint! It was absolutely amazing!!! Our server, Jenny was so sweet and helpful. She really took the time out to explain every detail since it was our first time dining with them! She recommended tomato oxtail soup base if you wanted something that was flavorful. It was definitely full of flavor! You didn't really need any of the dipping sauces (which you make yourself at the sauce bar) each meat, vegetable, etc. was amazing! We got the beef combo and shared it and it was so tender. Loved the conveyor belt that contained all the sides (mushrooms, shrimp, clams, veggies, etc) that you just grab when it comes around. Each plate was a certain color and each color signifies a certain price. The fish cakes/balls were fresh as well. Definitely worth the visit! I finally found my hot pot place..thinking about coming back here tomorrow!",

My girlfriend always gets the Beautiful Tomato Pot, which is rich and sweet with the aroma of fresh tomatoes.  The meat and veggies are always fresh, and if you're not quite sure what other sides to order off the menu, there is a rotating refrigerated conveyor belt with smaller items ranging from $.99 to $4.99 to choose from.  Quail eggs, tofu skin, fried fish cake, and house fish balls are some of my recommendations.   Their sauce station is great--you can mix and match your own personalized sauce dishes.  Not only do they have a wide selection of sauces (i.e. peanut sauce, goma sauce, ponzu, sacha BBQ sauce,) but the station is always clean and well kept.    With great food, excellent service, and a nice atmosphere, make sure to stop by Chubby Cattle next time you're in Vegas.",

When you bite into it, it somewhat numbs your mouth and then there is a hint of a metal flavor.   If you are a first timer I would recommend either the mushroom or tomato broth! Their presentation is beautiful especially with the combos. They have cute little baskets and use dry ice as decoration as well.   We had the meat combo, scallops, 2 mushroom soup, pork dumplings, rice (you have to order), crab meat, and veggie noodles. It came out to about $50 enough for 2 people. Everything was very tasty however you have to watch the noodles carefully because they tend to get pretty mushy if you leave it in too long.   I LOVE the sauce station ! They have a wide variety of sauces to choose from and to mix with. It was also a nice touch how they had sauce mixture recommendations.   They also have a happy hour for everything on the conveyor belt buy one get one free SUN-THURS 9:30-12:30.   Overall, I had a wonderful experience. Shout out to our server xiao xiao! She was very helpful with refilling our broth and with anything that we needed.",

    "text": "Would've given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for our horrible experience with the hostess. (Skip this paragraph if you don't wanna hear my complaining) I came here with my parents & was told on the phone that 3 people could just walk in without a reservation. When we arrived, the hostess told us there were only 2 groups ahead of us. I assumed the wait would be around 25 min max. After 40 minutes, we still weren't seated. All these tables were opening up and I was pissed why we weren't being assigned to any of them. Another couple started yelling at the hostess because apparently their reservation wasn't even honored. After also complaining to the hostess and manager about the open tables & our hour long wait, we finally sat down at a table around 9:00pm. Don't make the wait seem so short just to have us wait an entire hour and eat such a late dinner. We would've gone somewhere else if we had known beforehand.  The conveyer belt is a cool idea. Kinda like Kula revolving sushi or sushi boats. After ordering meat and a veggie basket from the menu, I honestly didn't need much from the conveyer belt though. They had so many options like green tea noodles, beef dumplings, fish balls, barley noodles, etc. Then on the menu, they had so many different options of meat (even fresh dungeness crab). The broth was delicious!! I got the entry level spicy broth and it was plenty spicy enough. There's also a sauce station with a bunch of options and omg....everything was amazing. Love the fried garlic.   Our waitress was amazing - she was friendly, knowledgable, and efficient unlike the hostess. The manager was also really sweet and came by our table to personally apologize for our experience earlier. Overall, food is delicious and I'm excited for them to open up a location in SF next!  PS. Your clothes will STINK after eating here, so wear something you don't really care about!",

We ordered the soup bases, vegetables, and wanted to order different meats. As we showed the waitress the check in coupon she said she couldnt honor the coupon. It was for EDC weekeend only. The coupon doesn't state so, and its online right now, so we went back and forth with her. Finally she left to check for us if she could honor it. Again. Its advertised. That's one of the reasons we came here for. As she came back she said a short. I'm sorry we are out of the meat. So we cant use the coupon. First she refuses to honor it and then magically they are out of the meat. Then we asked her what meats she is not out of and she offered the beef combo plate that entails three different meats. One is the waygu beef. So we were like you have the waygu beef when its entailed in the platter but not the waygu beef that you ADVERTISE for the coupon. Well thats great. Lol We just let it go and ended up ordering the meat combo plate and a stella(Which they were out of too...) We waited forever on our meats. We were almost done with the vegetables before even got the meat platter. The conveyer belt was full off mist, so we couldnt see whats on the belt. In all. Done come here. There are hundreds of other great places in town that actually value their customers and honor what they advertise. (Funny thing. Its been 24 hours after our visit and the coupon is still up)",

With all the hot pot places around the area now I was looking for something different.   I like the individuality of the meal, you can pick between two soup bases. One is not spicy and looks milky while the other is spicy and spicy is not an understatement. I love spice but ieven had to take out  a heaping amount of the chili peppers and various spices put into the broth. They even warn you that you shouldn't drink the soup, which was a bit of a bummer for me BC I like to enjoy my soup broth at the end. I just took out about a cup full of the peppers and spices and I was able to drink some of the broth.  The servings of meat is small in my opinion. The seafood presentation is beautiful however. They do have many choices of meats, vegetables, noodles, etc. And what you don't order you can take off the conveyor belt. Unfortunately not everyone in the restaurant can enjoy this conveyor belt feature, so if you are going strictly to experience that make a reservation or don't go during peak times.   This place can become quite pricey for what it is. Especially since there is another hot pot place down the road which offers more food for less the price and is jist as good. I will say the experience here is unique so check it out at least once.",

We also ordered the veggie platter, the rib eye, the wagyu beef, the pork belly, and the green tea noodles. The rib eye was to die for!!! The meat nearly fell apart while cooking!

The spicy soup base is pretty spicy so be conservative if you decided to have the chili soup base. They make their own fish a shrimp balls and I like them a lot, way better than those pre-made stuff. Service was solid, servers made good suggestions and pretty attentive. There's a sauce bar where you can make you own dipping sauce, have quite a few ingredients so you can experience a little with your sauce and that's also my kids favorite part of the restaurant.",

I tried the house special soup base, the chubby cattle wagyu beef, the seafood platter and from the conveyor belt we tried the shrimp ball and squid also tried the cucumber salad which I added some cherry tomatoes and cilantro which was all good. Then the dessert - mango crepe cake - super yummilicious. For a first timer with this restaurant it was good and we enjoyed it.

I do remember the staff there overall being super friendly and nice enough to smile at pretty much all times. Chubby Cattle is extremely welcoming and has really fast service. Sadly my concerns are definitely with some of the food. The spicy soup base had way too much peppers or chili-the floating ingredients already in the base. It was quite the hassle when with a mild spicy dish, I had spent a long time fishing so much of it out of the soup. The inconvenience affected how much time I spent actually eating and boiling noodles and meat in the broth. I'd hate to say it but this negatively impacted my overall experience. The meat, if you get the lamb, comes in such thin slices that it near dissolved overtime on the place and worse was not something I thoroughly enjoyed after cooking in the broth. I think that a better combination of food would have made for a better time, so this understanding and the thoughtful/quick service is what saves my thoughts on the Chubby Cattle.",

It's hot pot and how the menu works is you pick a broth, ( I picked the spicy one)  You can add noodles for $1 ( I had green tea and it's with the add on but only one order per person)  Pick your meat ( I picked brisket)  And then there's a conveyer belt of other add-ons, you grab whatever you want out of it and pay according to the plate color chart. My broth was spicy but kinda meh.  My meat was perfect, the noodles were good. I ordered water with lemon and asked for lemons 4 times and never got it but that's okay. The beer was 1/2 off so I of course ordered 2. They have an AWESOME sauce bar you can help yourself to. Honestly this is one of the funniest restaurants I've been to, the food was pretty good.  I'll be back.  Try this place out you'll have a good time and it's all a good price.",

In addition, there's a sauce bar with a lot of options.",

With inexpensive hot pot bases, a wide assortment of small dishes, and a house menu you can order from, there is no shortage of variety in the food here. Unlimited sauces and toppings means you can customize your hot pot to fit your flavor preference. My only gripe would be they run out of popular conveyer belt items and take forever to replace them while the same unpopular items pass by on an infinite loop, never to be picked. This is especially True during happy hour.",

    "text": "This place is AMAZING! I've tried the original broth, entry level hell and the mushroom broth, they all taste great but the original is my favorite! The broth can also be flavored with a wide variety of sauces and spices they have available (for free!).  You can grab however many sauces and seasonings you want, which includes soy sauce, chili sauce, oyster sayce, ponzu sauce, green onion, garlic, peanut butter, and a LOT more.  I highly recommend trying them all out!  They have a wide variety of small dishes you can pick off a conveyor belt to cook and eat in your hot pot, as well as a menu you can order off of which includes meat, noodles, and other dishes.  All of the ingredients on the conveyor belt taste very fresh, and range from a measy 99 cents to $3.99.  My personal favorites are the crab, fish cakes, and fried tofu! The meat is really tender and delicious as well and makes a perfect complement to the noodles and broth.    You can get full for a VERY reasonable price here, since the original soup base itself costs only $3.99.  The servers are attentive and explain how it works to newcomers, as well as giving you a run down of the daily specials.  They also refill your soup when it gets low, which is a nice bonus.  After your meal they even offer you a free popsicle!   I highly recommend this place for anyone who loves hot pot or is just looking to try something new.  The first of it's kind in Vegas and it sets the bar high!",

Chubby Cattle was a huge hit with the family and we'll be back!  Deni was our service and he did an excellent job of showing us the ropes.  We didn't have reservations so we sat at a table.  Not a problem.  At the center of the table is a warmer and you order two different broths.  We ordered an original for the kids and a medium spicy for us.    We ordered the angus, brisket, shrimp, veggies, noodles, dumplings, and more.  Everything was delicious.

The house broth is plentiful and really good! The sauce bar was HEAVENLY! I love how they give you suggestions of what goes with what and they turn out amazing! The conveyor belt is also really fun and don't be surprised if you look down at your plate and see tons of plates! You don't even realize you took so many items from the conveyer belt. Their cuttlefish fish balls are spectacular and work well with the soup! I love coming here and even though you smell like soup by the end of it you'll know that you had a good meal!",

Then go to station to create your own sauces. Also have \"free appetizers\" which was just pickled iceberg lettuce and edamame. Soup base was good, and the meats were very good. The beef combo is definitely the thing to get and not the seafood combo. That was very overpriced. Overall decent+ food and a fun experience but a little over priced. Small portions on a tiny dishes for avg of $3-$5 Good place but due to the reviews and hype, didn't live up to high expectations.",

Mango juice was a little think and heavy. Other than that, food was good, servers and staff were friendly. Would definitely recommend. Between the two of us, check total came to $70 with tip.",

A lot of room for a party of 4 to sit in a table. Recommend checking out the sauce bar to compliment your meals. Also recommend sitting close to the conveyor belt for a fun dining experience. Lastly, I really liked the chill music that they were playing",

It was a totally new experience for me. And I STRONGLY RECOMMEND trying their seafood like lobster, shrimp, etc. Aside from the food, the staff is super friendly. They asked for the feedback and I can tell they try to offer the best customer services. Hopefully, they will open a new chain in New York City!!!",

He greeted us and introduced himself professionally, and he was friendly throughout the entire dining experience. He always asked if he could refill our soups and waters, and always gave us tips on what we should pick up from the conveyor belt.   To top it all off, he was able to pull some strings to get us access to the buy 1 get 1 free deal a few minutes earlier than its usual start time.   I will be sure to visit again soon!",

The place is way off the strip which is great in my opinion, get away from the overpriced Vegas BS. We were not disappointed. Excellent service and they were very helpful in picking the soup/broth base We got the Yong yang with hellish hot and a milder house original. I can handle pretty hot and spicy so I got the medium, it's not that hot but of course everyone's opinion of hot is different. It definitely has some heat and a great flavor. We ordered the beef combo and seafood combo along with assorted mushrooms bok choy and cabbage. Everything was fresh and really happy with our order. The house hot tea was also amazing. They have a spice / dipping sauce bar that is pretty well stocked and is a wonderful compliment to you cooked items. We were here on a Monday evening and got right in without a reservation. You should call ahead though just in case as it filled up right after we arrived Highly recommend Chubby Cattle!",

Xiao was our waitress and she was very attentive. She guided us through the menu and made sure we had drinks and that we ordered just enough food. She was fast and friendly. The menu is sizeable and caters to every palate including vegans (funny to think about a Mongolian vegan -- he probably rode a rainbow unicorn). The meat was good portion and great quality. The broths were flavorful, we tried the half and half. If you needed more flavor, the dipping sauce bar was a nice touch.  We sat at a separate booth but the conveyor is also a interesting feature. We stuffed ourselves for $66.42 before tip.  Not a bad night!",

She took our drinks and came right back to take our soup choices.   Then she gave us our time and when she came back to get our meat, fish, and veggie orders, she didn't write anything down! She MEMORIZED everything. Keep in mind I came with a group of 8 and ordered for everyone.  We tried some of their fresh juices. I ordered watermelon juice and it is so refreshing! The mango juice was more of a smoothie and also good.   For the spicy soup, a few in my party ordered the \"deepest hell spicy\" level and the general consensus is that it wasn't spicy, but extremely oily. To drink the soup, they had to scoop the spicy oil off the top first.   For the house special soup, it had great flavor! I did scoop some of Hubby's spicy oil and mix it into my soup (delicious).   We ended up ordering 4 orders of the beef and lamb combo, 1 beef brisket, 1 house meatballs, 1 house fish ball (which comes on a bamboo that you scoop/scrape yourself - so cool), 1 Napa cabbage, 1 spinach, 1 tong ho, 1 pumpkin, 1 mixed mushroom basket, 1 fresh thick noodle, 1 fresh vegetable noodle, 1 udon noodle, and 1 sponge noodle.   Yup.. That's what it takes to feed 8. 5 guys, 3 girls, one of which is pregnant (me)! But everything was so tasty. And I love the sauce bar. Unlimited?? Why, thank you!  When we were about done, Sylvia came back and offered ice cream. The flavors presented were vanilla with chocolate chips, caramel with pecans, green tea, and coffee. I actually suggested they get plum flavor, and Sylvia said she'll try it tomorrow! Lol.   Overall, great quality. Amazing service. And fun experience! We'll definitely be back!!",

I've done my research prior to visiting so we kinda knew what to order but he keeps insisting to order the higher priced items so we felt pressured in that sense. This is a very pricy place for what you get with the food, you are paying for the experience and not the quality or value of food, my main reason why I'm not coming back. When we left, we still felt hungry even after paying over $100. For the price, you can go to a nice Korean BBQ Buffet.",

I typically order beef rib eye as well as the raw pork dumplings, glass noodles, and any extra vegetables. The conveyer belt around the restaurant is a cool addition to the ambiance as well as a great way to choose any extra add ons. Just beware of the sizing of the portions because my friend and I ordered 2 small sizes of bok choy and enoki mushrooms when in fact we probably could have shared one small of each between us. I typically order the spicy broth at mid level hell and it's the perfect amount of spice for me. I always look forward to eating here with friends with the fun communal environment, but your order can quickly become pricey if you're not keeping tabs of how many add ons you want.",

I was in the mood for hot pot so we found a shabu shabu place and we took a chance. Chubby cattle had great reviews and it did not disappoint. We ate until we were so stuffed and just kept cooking vegetables in the broth. My wife had the tomato soup broth which was phenomenal, and I have their normal broth which came with Chinese spice. The sauce bar was interesting treat, as we were able to make our own sauces and experiment with our hot pots.  I would definitely recommend this for a date night, or a small group.",

We were just two hungry white folk who had never experienced hot pots before (well, the Melting Pot-- but does that really count?) and we wanted to try something new. Reading the Yelp reviews-- we decided tonight was the night!  Chubby Cattle was amazing. The wait staff-- Harry and Angela were extremely friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the combo beef platter with the mushroom broth and the house broth plus a skewer of lamb and beef. There was so much food-- we couldn't finish it all!  Really-- we were intimidated walking in but it was totally worth it. Try Chubby Cattle if you are looking for a new great place for lunch or dinner!",

My reason for finally reviewing this place is after so many dining experiences; the fact they didn't have Szechuan pepper corns! Literally the main ingredient in Mongolian hot pot! Come on guys, get it together.          Now the broth was spicy and actually had some love, (they compensated by adding tons of chili oil and chili's) but it just drew the line. I love their beef combo great   meat program, but are often out of product.            Great concept with good product, but just never consistent. Try it out, maybe you'll have a good day for chubby cattle!",

We tried Beef Wagyu- this was very delicious but I didn't get to enjoy it much because once you cook it in the pot it shrinks very small ... so there's not much to eat. Beef brisket- this was good and was a stomach filler. The Quail eggs is our favorite. (Meatballs, land, fish etc). The broth soup is even better towards the end when all the proteins and veggies had simmered together giving a tasty result.   They also have a conveyor belt with food  over the counter that you can select from - and a self serve sauce area. Service was quick. Quality of food was phenomenal.   Check this place out if you're visiting Las Vegas and tired of eating on the strip. Located in asian Plaza.  The only downside is crowded parking.",

    "text": "After a few days in Las Vegas, anything other than more casino food was a welcome idea.  A friend of mine had apparently been to this place, and when he described it as a hot pot joint where food comes out on a conveyor belt for you to choose as little or as much as you want to eat, it was a pretty easy decision for the rest of us to agree to try this place out ourselves.  Being a dirty tourist, I can't speak for the location other than the fact that it was roughly a 20 minute ride using an Uber to get there from the south end of the Strip.  We ended up in what appeared to be very Asian part of town based on the stores rapidly changing from English to various Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names.  Eventually we arrived at our destination which was inside of a pretty packed and busy shopping plaza.  The interior of Chubby Cattle is very light, bright and welcoming.  Immediately upon entrance, you'll see the conveyor belt rolling adjacent to several booths, with lots of little plates containing various vegetables, dumplings, proteins and noodles.  We were lucky to not have a substantial wait, and were seated pretty quickly.  Service was quick, and gracious about explaining their process and pricing.  Basically, broth can be ordered individually or to share, and they come in a variety of spices and flavors.  Larger portions of meat can be ordered, raw, to which you will dunk them in boiling broth for a minute or so, before they can be eaten.  The conveyor belt has small portions of a wide variety of foods that are also cooked in the broth from anywhere from 2-4 minutes.  The color of the plates determine what each plate costs, and at the end of the meal, servers count and tally up all the plates at your table.  It's a pretty unique idea as far as I'm concerned, as the only place I'd ever encountered conveyor belts were sushi restaurants.  But the idea applies wonderfully to hot pot, and I have a lot of admiration for a place like Chubby Cattle at executing it in the way that they did.  Overall, I was very pleased with the dining experience, and I ate generously for roughly about $20 spent.  I had a wide variety of noodles, dumplings and lots of meat, and don't feel like I got shortchanged or cheated in any fashion.  Service was outstanding and friendly, and this is the kind of place that I'd tell my friends about, and actually want to come back to in future Vegas trips.",

They serve no alcohol, but tell you that you can walk over to Walgreens and buy it to bring over. The food taste like hot garbage. We paid and left to go eat at Herbs & Rye after this. Parking is a nightmare too, we had to park at the next center over.",

My friends kept talking about Chubby Cattle and how they were so excited to take me there, and I didn't really know what to expect. Boy was I blown away!!! I honestly never experienced anything like it.  First you are greeted very warmly by their staff, and when you are seated you'll noticed that the tables have little separate hot pots. And I realized that each person gets their own hot pot!! This is the first time I've seen this and it's absolutely brilliant!! It was my very first time, so the manager Sylvia came over who was extremely kind and really walked us through with a lot of tips. So first each of our little pot is filled with delicious flavorful broth. There's a side bar where you can pick so many different soup bases that you can bring back to dip your food in and/or add it into your pot's broth. Now here comes the fun part! Throughout the restaurant there's this conveyor belt where all these different kinds of ingredients go through!! The choices are endless!! Everything from tofu, pumpkin, mussels, noodles, bamboo... you name it! My mouth was literally drooling on the table and my hands had to catch them all otherwise I may flood the restaurant! Now comes the jaw dropping part.  Earlier we've ordered meat that Sylvia has suggested and when they came out it was almost surreal. We had a platter of brisket, ribeye, and wagyu which were all just absolutely gorgeous. Each piece brought my taste buds to a new level of happiness, and that wagyu was so beautifully marbleized that it just melted in my mouth like butter on a hot pile of pancakes. Just absolutely stellar. Then came the Kobe sashimi. Holy moly!!! I wasn't really a huge fan of raw meat to begin with, but after having their Kobe sashimi, my mind was totally blown. The marbleized meat was so smooth and buttery that it just melted with pure fresh flavor and this little kick of wasabi on top made it so refreshing! Each platter of meat was just a delight, and I wish I had like 4 stomachs to fill up just so I can keep eating!  All-in-all my time at Chubby Cattle was just absolutely fantastic. If I can give a 10 star rating I totally would. Wow what a day. Thank you so much to Sylvia and Chubby Cattle for the amazing experience, and I would definitely recommend and bring my friends back here!!!",

    "text": "Normally, I hate hot pot, but Chubby Cattle creates a dining experience like no other hot pot spots in LV. The restaurant is located on Jones and Dessert Inn in the plaza with District One and Asian BBQ.   When you first walk in, you're greeted by a host who seats you either at a both next to the conveyor belt of dishes, in front of it in a bar style or at booths nearby. I prefer to sit near the conveyor belt of dishes that come by because the items there are cheaper than if you order off the menu.   You begin by choosing your broth. I had the original and my husband had the ox tail. Both were delicious. My other friends had the spicy soup with a medium level (this was fairly spicy). Then, while you wait for your broth to come out, you can go to the sauce stand near the front and make your own sauce. I put the oyster sauce, garlic, and garlic chili. It was pretty tasty when you dip it with other things. I also made a side of the peanut sauce as well. Have fun with it!   We ordered the items we wanted in our hot pot.   Meats: Lamb and Beef (both were quality and tasty, but be careful. It cooks fast in your hot pot).   From the conveyor belt, we grabbed shrimp, tofu, fish balls, fish, veggies, mushrooms, qual eggs, etc. All were very tasty!   What I love about Chubby cattle is how everyone gets their own pot of soup and the freedom to put whatever they'd like in it. It's also stays warm in a little warmer on the table. The broth is always amazing and you get unlimited refills of it.   Price was affordable. Food and drinks for 5 people came out to $150 (includes taxes and tips).   I would definitely come here again to try the different broths and try different mixtures.   Happy Dining,  JT",

Be wary of over ordering, and bring an appetite!  TIP: ponzu, green onions, and garlic is always a safe base if you're a newbie at the sauce bar",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious!! Different, fun and yummy! We arrived 15 minutes after opening (5:15pm). The place was pretty much all to ourselves! But it didn't take long for this place to start hopping! We are currently in the keto diet so this was a great place for us. We ordered the hell out of some meat! Honestly my favorite was the chicken and thought least of their signature. My hubby ordered the original broth soup while I had the spicy. I am a huge spicy guru and they mild is pretty mild. If you're like me get the medium. Now he did explain that if it's not spicy enough he will fix it up for you.  Upon entering they were right at our side explaining everything to us. There is high energy dance music playing which was pretty pleasant. The waiter was very good, attentive and fun. He let us know if we aren't making a mess then we aren't doing it right!  They have a type of sauce buffet where you create your own sauces. That part was a lot of fun. A bit later I saw a long line to the sauce bar. I was very happy we had it all to ourselves when we enjoyed that part of our meal. The food is severed immediately.  They have a conveyor belt with plenty of extras.  We left stuffed! They asked if we would like desert but we couldn't eat another bite.  The prices are amazing. We had everything we wanted and kept ordering and walked out paying $50 including tip.  I highly recommend this place. It's fun, fresh and worth every dime.",

But the last time we visit this year, it was not pretty good.  We saw a advertisement on the wall near the front desk that they have the  special offer for member ship card, the server explain that if we would like to write something better on yelp, we can use $100 to take $118, but when a supervisor or manager come, he said there is no this special offer anymore. If you hadn't, why you put the advertisement on your store?  The server made the wrong oder for us, missed something, and Oder some food by mistake.   There is so crowed that no any space for the dishes on the small table. when we started to enjoy the food, there is no water, no juice we ordered.   We saw some guest was provided baby seat, and baby bib, but we hadn't, unbelievable to hold my daughter in my arm during the dinner.    Worst experience, we won't back again.",

    "text": "There is a new game out there called \"Chubby Cattle\" where you stuff large amounts of meat into your mouth and say nothing... just chew, swallow, and let the serotonin do its job to your body.   Setting: I have been here during its grand opening and have returned for its re-grand opening. The decor of the restaurant has been updated with an improved layout to the sauce station. Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option.   Service: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over.   Food: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture.   Personal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket + Wagyu Beef + side of enoki + rice. Bam!   Overall: One of my favorite places to eat hot pot. Great quality meat and savory flavorful broth, this place has it all!",

We got beef and thin cut chicken breast, next time we will stick with just beef but it was all good.  The mushroom basket was one of the best parts for me there were about 4 or 5 different mushrooms in the basket all tasted great in my spicy soup. The mango and green tea desert cakes are really good too,mango was my favorite.  The waiter was awesome great service from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave.

The fact that they open from 5 pm-12 am is actually a plus, since it means that everyone in the kitchen is not haggard and the meats are all fresh. The service is acceptable, still a little rough I guess. Just a few things, my mushroom soup base, which my mom also ordered took about 15 mins after everyone in our table start eating. So they were almost done while my soup barely makes bubble. Our server didn't explain on how things are done in their establishment. For example, the conveyor belt, how to turn on the individual stoves and also what is in the menu, or ask at least if this is our first time or are we a returning customer. It would've made the experience a little more better. Also, the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms of my boy friend ordered when our server was pitching the daily specials at the start of the meal arrived at the end of the meal, with the enoki burnt and the bacon not all the way cook. And this man, eats a lot of bacon. Daily specials, unless you actually have to harvest or kill a live animal should be part as the appetizer experience, to tease the taste buds on the next gastronomical adventure that would follow, not present it when the person is full and almost done with their meal. All in all, it was an experience, I can't really say if it's good or bad and I do understand that they have a little bit more refinement to do. The soups though were perfection, yes they are bland at first but that's what the condiment/sauce/spice bar in the middle of the restaurant is for, to create your own flavors and make the experience and your imagination tingle for a little while. I will be back and I do hope the next time, I could say it is beyond 5 stars.",

They were so kind to give us little snacks while we waited. Their soup the hot pot had these herbs I remembered my mom would make for with when we were sick, so I knew the soup was super healthy. The vegetable and mushroom combo had so many varieties of different vegetables and mushrooms. The meat we had was soft and tender. They had a table full of different sauces you can choose from. I had the ponzu sauce and chili so it was sour and spicy combine with the tasty herby soup, I can't ask for a better experience with hot pot. Fantastic eat! I gave them a four star because we ask for one of their desserts but they said it would take too long to make. It seems like they were rushing us out because of the long line. However their service were all very nice. If I had some green tea ice cream I think my dinner would been a perfect 5 star experience.",

He was able to get us 2 platters of A5 Kobe for our table of 9, and they run out quick sometimes hours after open. Very lucky to have gotten him as our server! Thank you Deni!

For four people we ordered two beef combo platters, two sliced chicken breast, one pork belly, a veggie combo and two orders of udon noodles. We definitely ordered too much. We should have just ordered two beef platters, a veggie combo and udon noodles and called it a day. Regardless, we enjoyed the The beautiful tomato broth and their house broth. It was fun to dip everything in and share the experience with friends. Will definitely do it again.   We would have given five stars but there were a few downsides. 1) parking. There is virtually no parking in this strip mall on a Sunday night. 2) the wait. We had to wait over 45 minutes for a table. 3) it took about 5-10 minutes to greet us and get us water. After the wait we had an incredible experience.",

A lot going on if you're dining here with anyone who's new to hot pot, a little bit of a different experience then Korean BBQ since you're in charge of your own pot individually and own cooking.  I ordered the original soup base to start and placed an order for noodles, mushroom basket, beef and shrimp paste.  The servers here are really good with explaining how hot pot works and demonstrating items I've never had like the shrimp paste.  Everything was so good, mushroom variety was great,  meat was fresh, noodles were fresh and shrimp paste added a nice variety of flavor and texture to the meats and veggies.    The conveyor belt was also a nice addition, you can easily grab any items you'd like to throw in your pot as it passes you, nice and convenient!   I really enjoyed the sauce bar where you can make your own sauces, there was just a lot to choose from and can be overwhelming if you don't know which flavors go with what.  I had to go back twice to make a couple different sauces to accompany my meal.    I would definitely return, I feel like with all the combinations of soup bases and sauces you can choose from can make each visit a different experience.  I would like to try the most popular oxtail broth next time probably though.",

    "text": "Hello Las Vegas!  I'm Nette B. of <a href=\"http://Nette.Yelp.Com\">Nette.Yelp.Com</a> and I dined at your restaurant.    I'll give the disclaimer now.  I've been to really good hot pot restaurants and unfortunately Chubby Cattle is just meh.  I've had hot pot in San Diego and Hawaii and my palette desires good tasting food.   If you've never had hot pot then to you this is good. For me?  Meh... It's alright.   We came here for my birthday dinner.  My choice while in Vegas so I can introduce my family members to Mongolian Hot Pot.  We made reservations for a table of 6 at 8pm on February 1, 2019.  We arrived at 10 minutes to 8pm and our table was not ready so we waited a few minutes. We opt for the individual pots so that everyone in my party would have their own choice of broth.    DISCLAIMER: Individual  small pot is not served in the ying yang pot.  Boo!  Other places I've been has the split pots for smaller individual. I will say that having tables with individual small pots is a great idea.    Our server was Deni.  He was nice and he tried to recommend and upsell us on some platters etc.  I think they only one we fell for was the basket of vegetables in which we didn't eat it all and ordered extra baby bok choy instead.  We should've stuck with our gut and order 2 large bok choy.  He also tried recommending the oxtail broth and only 1 person in our party ordered that and she was not pleased.  She took the spicy hot broth from another person to add more flavor.   I personally ordered the entry level hot.  Three people ordered the medium hot and they LOVE spicy 10 hot at thai restaurants and they were saying it was really hot & spicy where they were sweating.  LOL but still liked the broth.  I, on the other hand was thinking OMG this is extremely hot.  I scooped up a lot of red peppers in my pot.  See how red my pot in my photo.  But I pressed through and enjoyed my meal.  I had to ask to add more mild broth so calm the heat down.  Demi didn't come by to do that when I asked that I had to flag down another server who kindly filled my pot for me.  Also, we had to ask for our waters to be refilled.  :(    Food:  A lot of pork belly since I can eat 2 plate fulls for myself. :)  Basket of vegetables Rib Eye  Mussels  Tofu  Squash from the conveyor belt and noodles.    So, the noodles are made in house.  If you are used to egg noodles then I would recommend the tomato noodles.  They have different flavors and they also offer a basket of noodles.  Blah, not happy with the noodles also.  I had to dip it in my soy sauce I created.  Speaking of created, there's a sauce bar where you walk up to in the middle of the restaurant when you enter and you make your sauce.  I used vinegar and soy sauce.  Others used the ponzu and garlic etc.  I was pleased with my sauce but the area looked a bit dirty and no one was cleaning it up to make it look presentable.    At the end we spent about $200. Not bad prices but the broth prices are a bit pricey.  $6.99 for the oxtail broth.  I would return again If I desire Hot Pot in Vegas.  But my go-to would be in San Diego and Costa Mesa where the Hot Pot's are more desirable.   Not bad but also not the best.  Lastly, I spoke to another friend who lives in Vegas who agreed with my feedback.      #<a href=\"http://nette.yelp.com\">nette.yelp.com</a> #YelpBlackElite",

If I'm eating average food and it is costing me an arm and a leg, the food experience goes down because I'm thinking it isn't worth it. With higher price points, my expectations are higher.  The hotpot was good, and the sauce bar was really fun, but the price point is high. I spent about $40 for myself and I was half full. My fatass clearly needs more food to be content.   Anyway, the place is busy. I have only gone once and haven't been back because I don't want to leave hungry.",

I seen open spots at the bar and management said we would need to be seated. If we want food. However only myself wanted food at the time. So we sat by the conveyer belt and ended up not having the same customer service as when Brandon. I felt as if the manager was watching me the whole time like we weren't suppose to be there. This is my Favorite spot! The food is amazing! But when feeling uncomfortable in somewhere your so used to it's make me re think the value.    I hope next time I get to sit at the bar as usual and enjoy the great service I received from the start.",

You just select the items you want and pay the amount according to the plate color. There should be a sticker on the table stating the price for each plate.   I chose the house broth which is a light and clean tasting broth. Very wild in flavor but still delicious. My friend ordered the tomato ox tail broth and she loved hers as well. I tasted it and it was a little sweet and salty. There were chunks of ox tail in there too.   The sauce bar here is HUGE. Probably the largest variety of sauces I've seen by far and I eat alot of AYCE hot pot spots. They had my favorites, the satay and ponzu. They had varieties of peanut sauce which I know a lot of people love. A hot pot spot is only good if they have good sauces to pair with it!! Love it.   I ordered the beef platter to share with my friend and it was more than enough to get us full. We also got a variety of selections from the conveyor belt, but not too much since we were not super hungry. The total came out to around $50 which is pretty steep since you can go to AYCE places for that price & eat as much as you want. But the quality here is great so worth the price.",

I do like that everyone can choose their own soup base in their own container. There is a conveyer belt where you can pick some items like noodles, vegetable, seafood that passes by but mostly you have to order with a server. Parking can be quite difficult during peak hours. If you are the type to eat a lot, this place can get costly.",

    "text": "Living in Vegas, this place has been my go-to hot pot in the valley. I've been here a few times to say that this place has high quality meats and flavorful broths. Not to mention their self-serve sauce station! I particularly like it place due to its individual pot that is placed right in front to you, that way you don't have to worry about reaching toward the middle of the table to grab your food.   My go-to items on the menu are the beef platter, meatball platter and vegetable platter. These give me a variety of items to choose from without having to worry what to choose. Especially when you are indecisive, like me, and can never choose which vegetables to have. There is also a conveyer belt that goes through the booth seating where they have individual plates to choose from. My favorite broth has got to the the house special, its creamy, garlicky, and just enough flavor to cook my meal in. I've tried the spicy broth, which can be very spicy, depending on which level you get. The spice doesn't hit you until after you have consumed all your food! Haha  I do have to agree with my fellow yelper Debrah about the restaurant being clustered. Depending on where you sit, there is a lot of traffic of the servers going in and out down the row of booths. This is particularly in the middle of the restaurant where the window is, that's where the servers come to pick up the food. It does get a little cramped when a new party gets seated by the host, servers going in and out of the row, including the people already being seated trying to get to the sauce bar for seconds or thirds. Other than that, I couldn't recommend this place more.",

They asked if we wanted individual pots (yes!) and if we wanted to sit next to the belt (another yes!).  Woot woot.   Our server was fantastic.  Explained everything from the get go and checked back on us quite often.  I ordered the entry spicy broth but also got to try their original.  Both were delicious and fantastic.  Lots of amazing flavor.  They have a sauce bar for you to create your own concoction so go crazy!  We ordered quite a bit of meat, beef and lamb.  Great quality.  You could see the kitchen at work slicing your meat and putting your items together.  We ordered the seafood combo and tons of veggies.  If you want a little side of something, you can grab it on the conveyor belt.    Everything was extremely fresh.  Our broth levels never got low.  I was impressed by chubby cattle.  A definite return when we come back and highly recommended if you're craving some hot pot in LV!",

When I arrived, the restaurant was about to close but they politely accommodated me anyways. I ordered several different dishes for my party of 5. We tried the house flavor broth and the tomato rib one (a bit salty but still tasty).  My favorite meat was the pork belly. There were a few selections of meat that were out so I'll be back to try them.   While the fish was good...there were too many bones for me to pick out.   Also wanna add that the 3 flavored noodles are bomb! They soak up the flavor of your broth so well.",

Whether it be girls night, date night, or a big group outing I already feel confident they will continue to deliver amazing flavor and customer service!   Each person picks their soup base to start out with (I chose the mushroom one and ). Each person has an individual warmer to keep their broth in.  You then proceed to the little buffet style bar to choose additional ingredients to add to you base. You can choose from so many times such a as sesame oil, minced garlic, green onions, cilantro, chili garlic paste, to name a few. The edamame(which I chose to top w sea salt,Chile  garlic paste and minced garlic) and cucumber salad at the flavor bar SO good!   After creating your broth to your tasting comes the fun part...the meat/seafood options!  We chose 2 lamb, 2 shrimp, mussels, dumplings, a veggie platter, a noodle trio, and a meat combo...generous portions we will know next time not to order so freaking much!   Then you start cooking all your ingredients yourself to your liking. We seriously ate for almost 2 hours straight bc of the portion sizes and of course how tasty it was! BE CAREFUL SHIT IS SO HOT (Temperature wise) OMG and they bring a refill of broth at no charge! Which pricing in general is very reasonable.   Billy our sever was extremely nice and made our experience enjoyable and not at all rushed, thank you!!",

What makes this place unique is the quality of the food.  No matter what you get you cannot go wrong.  Make sure if you have a large party to make sure to make a reservation.  It seems every time we come this place is hopping. Some of my favorites are the beef tongue, the mixed mushroom basket, the seafood combo platter, and the lamb.  I always go with the Deepest Level Hell 18 (I guess it is because the devil is inside me) for hot pot base.  This soup adds tons of flavor without overwhelming the flavor of whatever you decide to throw in.  I strongly suggest you taste their grape sake.  Grape Ape.  An unique sake if I have ever had one.  Jenny is awesome!!!!  I may prefer Deepest Hell for my Hot Pot, but this place is complete heaven.",

    "text": "\"I've been practicing eating lamb after I saw Eater put this place on the heat map\"  says Midwest poker bud, smiling ear to ear.  \"Practicing?\"  I say.  \"Yep.  I bought a some. grilled it. and ate it.  Taste pretty good doused in BBQ sauce\" his reply.  \"OK, let's go.  Errr and good luck\".  Snazzy, contemporary feel, HD monitors everywhere, plexiglass cutouts in the table to protect your mobile, and a conveyor belt filled with raw foods.    Simple hotpot concept.  Choose the broths, choose the proteins and veg (help yourself is seated by the conveyor belt and pay by the plate colors), cook in your personal or communal pot if you wish, dip in a sauce, and eat.  The broths sampled (house and \"hellishly spicy\" mid level heat) are wonderfully aromatic with the pronounced flavor of ginseng, cardamom, cinnamon, and other oil based spices (unsure of the extract but it has a bitterness and green vegetal finish similar to chrysanthemum).  It's not for everyone.  The broth is mildly seasoned.  Use of the dipping sauces is required to get the fullest flavor.  Warning, spice heat is achieved with dry chilies and LOTS of them.    Good selection of mushrooms and relatively fresh veg.  Very good selection of proteins including multiple kinds of tofu, free ranged chicken, USDA choice to Wagyu beef, lamb and a plethora of live seafood.  Of course, wanting the authentic, it's all about the lamb and mutton. (Mongolia is land locked isn't it?)  Tip:  If it doesn't live together, don't cook them together.  That is unless you want to create a very \"unique\" soup.  - Mutton (thick sliced) - pronounced gamey flavor, lots of external fat.  Cooked rare for best flavor. - House special lamb - thin cut, cooks instantly.  Very little fat.  Subtle leg of lamb flavor. - Supreme lamb shoulder - most connective tissue, least lamb flavor.  Finally, do not pass on the charcoal grilled skewers.  the spice rubbed lamb, moist though cooked through and tasty lamb ribs with its melting fat and chewy connective tissue just good eats.   Both are well seasoned to enhance the classic lamb flavor.  A grilled \"French style\" rack of lamb, very aggressively seasoned with a spice rub, cooked through but tender with the cleanest lamb flavor; too fancy.  Patient and helpful servers who are willing to take the time to explain the many options.    Eater Vegas has it right, deserving of the hype.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS HOTPOT and great service! I had to call twice to change our reservation time because my friends and I were having trouble getting an Uber. But the reception lady was super nice about and saved us a table despite being late to our third change of time.   We ordered a large pot to share the soup bases. You can order up to 3 bases for one large pot and we got the spicy one, seafood, and original.  And for the meat, we got beef, lamb, fish balls, and sliced fish.   As for vegetables, we got napa cabbage and enoki mushrooms. And a side of glass noodles.   The soup bases are everything I love in hotpot! Lots of chili oil and spice in the spicy base and lots of sea flavor in the seafood base. They were all thick in flavor but light in consistency. Overall great broth!   Besides having tasty soup bases, when you ask for a refill on soup, they actually give you soup instead of like other places where they usually refill with water instead.",

    "text": "FINALLY!!!! Some Chinese hot pot in Vegas!   The meats are great here and are reasonably priced. I love how many broth options they have. My favorite is honestly the tomato one. If you want it spicy just add chilly oil!   The have a great variety of veggies and sides to cook.  The fish balls are a must and I'm talking about the fresh ones and not the frozen rubbery ones!   The conveyor belt idea is pretty cool but the prices on the belt do not match the price in the menu. So I wonder which is better to grab off of?   The only downside about here is portions of their sides. For a large noodle, they told me it's good for 2 people. When I saw it, I thought this isn't even enough for me. Even when I ordered a large enoki mushroom, I was very very small and it made me wonder how much they would give in the small size?   The service is okay when they are busy. But they were good when it was slow.   What I didn't really like was they were haggling for a review in return for ice cream. Kind of annoying to some customers...",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this new hot pot place!  Since this place just recently opened, I thought there would be a long line or wait, but we were seating right away.  We were not seating at the areas near the revolving conveyor of dishes, but where we were seated was still okay.    I really like the set up.  We were seating on a high top with 8 recessed induction systems (4 on each side).  Very neat concept because you can just drop in the pot.  This makes  hot pot eating easier.  Also, I like how ergonomic friendly the sauce bowls are.  Makes it easier to dip things.    Another neat concept of this great hot pot place is the sauce bar.  Typically or traditionally, you are served with chinese bbq sauce, but there are plenty of other sauces available at the sauce bar, such as hot chili oil, sesame oil, garlic, salt, sugar, peppers, and more!  I definitely got some chinese bbq sauce, hot chili oil, and some sesame oil with salt and white pepper.    The menu if filled with a great variety of combos.  Also comes with a great variety of broth base flavors.  I decided to get the medium spicy broth, and it had just the right amount of spice to it!  When I got my broth, there were so many spices and flavors, I didn't know what type of spices and peppers they were, but the broth was excellent.    Got the beef combo, mushroom basket, and the lamb shoulder.  Beef combo came with brisket and ribeye.  Mushroom basket is pretty self explanatory.  Lamb shoulder for $5 came with a good amount to share with 2 people.    Overall, this hot pot place was an excellent experience.  I can't wait to go again!!!",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night and waited about 15 minutes to sit by the conveyor belt. Have been wanting to check this place out because there has never been an authentic Chinese hot-pot restaurant in town. I had thought the conveyor belt would be popular, but soon realized it's very under-used, barely anyone picking out dishes from it. Its plates are color-coordinated by prices, and honestly, each of them all seemed a little over-priced for the portion. Decided to order from the menu instead.   We ordered an original house broth and a tomato broth. For the meat, we ordered a plate of wagyu beef at a discounted special price, a plate of angus beef (apparently popular for first-timers), a veggie combo, a 3-noodles combo, shrimp balls, and a bacon-wrapped needle mushrooms for appetizer. Surprisingly, all of that was almost the perfect amount of food for two. The presentation of the plates were great, with our wagyu beef clouded in dry ice, and the veggies in a tree-stump basket..definitely went out all.   Everything tasted very fresh. The house broth is supposedly the healthiest broth option, made with beef, chicken and herbs. Its flavor is definitely more on the subtle side, but if you want a soup with a lighter and healthier flavor, this is the one. The tomato broth was delicious. There's a hint of sweet in it, but the tomato flavor tastes very real, a great option if you want more flavor to your cooked meat, veggies, noodles, etc. Both broths can just be enjoyed as soups as well, not greasy at all like usual hot-pot broths.   All the food came down to less than $70 for two people, definitely worth it for the freshness of the ingredients and the experience, in my opinion. If you're a first-timer to the restaurant, or to hot-pot in general, it may all seem a little intimating with the steps and process. But once you get the hang of how everything works, this is a great place to enjoy dinner, especially when the weather gets colder! Definitely one of my favorites! Perhaps one of the most authentic Chinese hot-pot restaurants I know!",

    "text": "I was super stoked when I heard about Chubby Cattle because 1) I love hotpot and 2) I love conveyor belts (come on, we are already cooking our own food, who is trying to do cardio walking up and down to the fridge while eating?! Am I right? Lol)   Food: Chubby Cattle has a big menu with beautiful platted seafood and meat options. They also have noodles, vegetables, mushrooms, etc. on their menu. Their conveyor belt is also very impressive and I saw taro pieces to seafood to various greens. My brother and I ordered the tomato and seafood broth, and honestly I found them both very bland and flavorless. The seafood was very watered down and tasted like the seasoning from ramen packets (I read from other reviews that the mushroom and house special broths were also bland). The tomato broth was much better and probably the only broth I'll consider ordering if I come back. We also ordered the seafood platter, beef brisket (because my fave beef tongue was sold out), and vegetable noodles. The seafood consisted of muscles, scallops, shrimps, clams, and octopuses. Both the seafood and brisket dish were very fresh and did not seem frozen beforehand.   Service: Mathew was our server and he was amazing. He answered all our questions, made suggestions, refilled our waters twice without us asking, cleaned up our table as soon as one of our plates were empty, and got our ice creams quickly. While all the servers seem stressed and all over the place, I found that our server kept his cool and smiled whenever he passed by. Thank you Mathew!  Overall: I'll definitely come back because the prices of the conveyor belt items were fair (ranging from .99 cents and up), the meat and seafood platters were great quality, and it was just a great experience to enjoy with family and friends. Hopefully they add more soup options or at least perfect their other ones because it sucks when the soup bases are so bland.",

The lamb sliced and the Hot and Spicy levels being just the right touch for me to feel like I am back in Beijing enjoying my Favorite Hot Pot spot.   The prices are a bit high for just vegetables but it's ok because the meat selection and all you can get sauces make it all the more worth it.   Table settings are a bit tight for the space, I would say they are utilizing the square footage but the space is still small and tight. This makes me feel Claustrophobic which usually makes me not want to stay in these types of restaurants, the food and service make up for it.   Recommend for a try and also know they have Veggies for all my Veggie people.",

Service was awesome, our waitress was very accommodating and explained the menu to us since it was our first time. The sauce area was very convenient and lots of choices.

    "text": "With the weather finally starting to cool down in Las Vegas, Chinese hot pot is a great idea to warm yourselves up!  Location: Chubby Cattle is located in the same busy compound as Snow White coffee shop. Expecting the wait to be extremely long because of past reviews, we were surprised when we arrived and were seated immediately. Right away, the stand in the middle of the restaurant with the multitude of sauces available to serve yourself with caught my eye. The star of the show, however, was the revolving conveyor belt placed in between a few lucky tables. Although I did not have the chance to experiment with the crazy contraption, it seem apparent that the plates were color-coded according to price. Want something? Open the door by your table, pick it up, and the price will be marked!  Food: You first choose the type of broth you want. Not wanting to burn internally and having a pretty low tolerance to spice, I chose the entry level hellfire broth. Though seemingly fiery with its bright red color, I found it to be very flavorful. Although I don't know what is specifically in the broth, it was a great base to the foods yet to come. The menu offered plenty of choices, from individual choices to combos. From the seafood combo to the brisket to the enoki mushrooms ordered, food was consistently a high quality. All came with enough to share between 2 people. At the end of the meal, we were also given free ice cream!  Service: Service was excellent. We were checked upon constantly to ensure we were having a good dining experience. Food was delivered promptly. The servers all seemed very willing to help and were all very knowledgeable about the menu and the options available.  In the coming winter months, this will be my go-to place for hot pot. Great concept, delicious food, and awesome staff. Will be returning soon!",

    "text": "Very unique and fun restaurant. Takes hot pot meals to another level. There is a conveyor belt of refrigerated dishes you can choose from to add to your hot pot (just like sushi conveyor belt, you pay based on the color of the plate). The servers are extremely helpful and attentive. You start off by picking the base broth (original was very good). The you can add the protein/veggies as desired. Can order what is on the menu or pick from the conveyor belt. My daughter and I started with the combo beef plate $13 and raw pork pot stickers which was  perfect for our two personal pots. After you order the broth, head on over to the sauce station and prepare your dipping sauce. Lots of choices so can get overwhelming. I choose the ponzu, garlic, green onion, and a bit of chili paste. Came out perfect. Also ordered hand-made noodles and bowls of rice. Once the pot was boiling, started adding the ingredients and then the thin sliced beef one slice at a time since they cooked very quickly. Then added fresh shrimp, tofu, rice cakes, sausages, mussels (all from the conveyor belt). Made the soup very tasty but be cautious with the soup though, it's boiling hot...literally. We enjoyed our meal and will return next time in Las Vegas!",

Restaurant was cute, clean and the staff was super nice. Fun eating!! Oh PS... I'm a finicky eater, don't like onions and certain spices and I did fine. I had the mushroom broth (not spicy at all) and they have a sauce bar so you can add flavors as you wish. Also, they have little signs telling you how long to cook certain foods (e.g. chicken 30 seconds)... so smart!!",

    "text": "Had to wait a few minutes after we arrived to sit at the conveyor bar. Hostess took the time to go over setup and menu. Immediately met our fantastic waiter, Kwan. He explained the process and got us started. The sauces are great and the beef combo was perfect for two people to share. The rest of the items we just pulled from the conveyor belt as it went around. We thought this system actually was very smart as other hot pot places your table becomes inundated with items since they bring everything out at once. Here, you can have a pretty organized eating space as you take and eat at your place. The conveyor belt is not just a gimmick. Everything tasted fresh and the broth was delicious. Look for Kwan as he is super friendly and made the experience at Chubby Cattle over the top. Will definitely be back.",

My friends and I decided to do the individuals pots so we could choose our own soup bases. I'm a first timer, I'm glad our server Deni was super nice and gave us a few great suggestions to start. This place has everything you could ever want in your hot pot which is great but also overwhelming for indecisive people that eat with their eyes like me lol. If you're like me, I'd recommend going with the combo platters, skip the menu and then pick and choose what you'd like. The homemade meatballs were a hit or miss. It was assorted so some were yummy and some not so much. However, I was pretty disappointed that they were much smaller than expected. I'd skip it next time.   Overall, I'd come here again!",

    "text": "I agree with some of the other reviews about Chubby Cattle. For the price, the only thing chubby is their coffers when you leave. The meat is good and sliced as thin as the lima bean scene from a Mickey Christmas Carol where Mickey slices a see thru thin bean to feed himself, Donald and Goofy. The other thing in common Mickey has with this place is the price of a Disneyland ticket and your check when you leave this place. If you see familiar with Shabuya in LA, then this is a subpar experience at twice the price and half the quality in a return investment.  Sure the food comes through a rotating conveyor belt and you order the soup base and meat with the waiter. I can go to Sonic and they deliver your food on roller skates.  I honestly don't know the difference between the meat quality here and Swish.  The sauce station is a mix of confusion. There are just too much different choices to choose from. I ended up with a pretty nasty flavor since you can't really taste the sauce. Everyone seems to have their own style of satay sauce. Rarely have I found one that was tasty and nothing more than just peanut sauce mixed with oil.  I went with my two guy friends, ordered $70 worth of food and left hungry. All three of us vowed not to ever go back again.",

    "text": "First time here and on a Tuesday evening at 7pm. The parking lot seems like it could fill up quickly on a busier night because of all the businesses in this small center.  My friend called ahead and made a reservation for our group. The host at the front was sweet, she tried to get me to participate in a spin wheel game. One spin per party apparently and you can only spin if you follow them on social media.  I was the first guest there from my party so I asked to be seated at the table and I ordered a coconut mojito which the server boasted about. He proclaimed that people drove in from California just to have this mojito. I tried it, it was alright. I don't really like sweet drinks so he definitely sold me on this one. It did take a tad bit long for them to get it for me, as my entire party had arrived and we even got shots of soju, our pots, meat and baskets before it arrived. The server was kind and very excited to help, unfortunately he spoke a tad bit too fast and jumped around a lot when explaining the ordering process and such. I still don't even know if you could have the option of sharing a pot.  We each had a pot, I chose the beautiful tomato something and we split a veggie basket, some meat and mushroom basket. Besides the items you could order from the menu, there's a conveyor belt of frozen/raw foods you could add into your pot. My broth was awesome, I would most likely get a different one just to try something new if I ever returned. There's a sauce station which I thought was pretty neat because they had a lot of different ones. They also had some sides like edamame and stuff. There's large and small booths along the conveyor belt and I also think there was bar type seating too. I didn't visit the restroom during this trip. Overall, the place seemed kind of tight/clustered. I feel like the servers were almost colliding with each other. I might bring my family back here for a try, not sure yet really.",

Water was always refilled, empty plates were immediately taken out of the way, and he was great at recommending dishes. Not only that but he has a great sense of humor from start to finish. Every employee thanked us on the way out and wished us a good night. Thanks for the great hotpot experience!   Don't forget this place is cash only, so plan ahead. Also we couldn't find parking, so we parked in the lot across the street. This are the only two cons, but the food made it worth it!",

    "text": "Update: switched from 4 star to 5 star. Came back again and the fluke I mention below was exactly that, there was no issue at all with the food coming out timely the second time around. Also got to order the house made noodles and oh my gaaaaw life changing, could piss you off though having to deal with subpar noodles everywhere else you go but they are so good you can't not get them.   This was delicious! Party of 6 ordered a seafood platter, lamb, ribeye and grabbed other stuff off the conveyor belt. I ordered the tomato oxtail broth, delicious, sort of rich though just a heads up if you want a lighter broth, but I still recommend it with that warning. A couple people order the mushroom broth, I read in reviews it was sort of bland, in our opinion it was perfect. Makes it more of like a shabu shabu broth but it still had plenty of flavor and I will be getting it from now on because it was super yummy. Spicy broth is spicy but good. It'll make you sweat a little.  We grabbed watercress (delicious!), spinach, baby bokchoy, noodle, tofu, peeled shrimp and maybe more from the conveyor belt but you can order it as well. Everything was fresh and cut or separated for easy cooking and eating.  1 star docked for kitchen/wait staff communication. We waited a long time for the ribeye to come out, like all of our meat was gone and it had not come. When it did come we got 1 out of 3 trays of it, (they are shaved thin and with 6 people 1 tray is about 1 slice per person plus 1 or two more thin slices) so it was gone quick and it was another long wait before the other 2 came (which they brought both that time). But they were super apologetic and seemed to just have a communication issue with one another, like I don't know what, but they seemed surprised we weren't getting what we ordered and talked amongst themselves to get it done.  Anyway we are totally coming back because this place is awesome and I am sure that was all just a fluke problem with our order. Everything else went smooth and staff was super nice and showed us an awesome dipping sauce that everyone loved. Highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "I was real skeptical about this place because I'm not big on soups but I have to say this establishment is delicious. I went with the original soup base. It had a light beef broth type of flavor. I threw in some udon noodles, rice cakes, imitation crab, 3 different types of beef, and my own concoction of garlic, soy sauce, chili paste, and sesame oil. ( there is a sauce bar at the front of the restaurant to customize your soup) I was having a lot of fun making the hotpot my own way.  My wife had the most popular oxtail soup base. It had a hint of tomato flavor. She added corn, beef, and glass noodles. I tried some of this and it was delicious as well.  One of my friends ordered medium spicy and he recommended not to order any of the spicy soup bases because there is a huge amount of oil that sits on the top.  Definitely order the oxtail base or original base and make it as spicy as you want from the sauce bar.  The servers were very friendly and helpful with understanding how to order from their menu and answered all our questions regarding the different ingredients.  The big question is would I come back again? I think so.",

We got here kind of late today, so there was already no appetizer at 9pm.   Sorry, we did have the spicy seeweed salad.   The lamb was the last photo, and really a bit thick and also small.  More like something I would stir fried.    The vegetable dishes are small yet around $3 a plate average.    The tri quality beef we ordered were average at best.    It's a fast choice but all these shabu shabu places are making me want to buy a meat slider.  I also think this place has heavy MSG, I am thirsty already and still inside the restaurant",

I wouldn't recommend coming on a weekend because it's pretty busy especially in winter. Lunch usually has no wait but only offered Friday and Saturday.   Japanese pork jowl is the best meat and a must have. \"ITS DA BOMMMMMB\" Beef combo is always safe. Noodle combo is also extremely good. Fresh vegetables are always offered. I would maybe stay away from the handmade meat balls in my opinion but many people actually love it.   Favorite soup would be the mala spicy one.   IMITATION CRAB STICKS. are a must. way better than the real shit. I come here so often it's actually ridiculous.  Huge shout out to my girl Jenny for taking care of us and being very responsive.",

    "text": "Came across this place in an article that gave top 10 places to try in Chinatown. We love hot pot and the concept of individual bowls was even more convenient, and I have never seen a hot pot conveyor belt. Glad we picked this place because I would have never known that it was featured on Travel Channel with Andrew Zimmern. So it must be legit.  They have two types of table. Tables that seat 4 or 6 that has a hole in front of you for individual hot pot. Or you can sit at another style table on the other half of the restaurant with the traditional family yin-yang pot that's shared in the middle. The server didn't even ask us and immediately seated us at the individual pot table.   He explained the meats and how to select items. First, was to pick the soup base, seven to choose from. As a first timer we went house original ($4.99) and tomato oxtail ($6.99). Second, meat selections are order from the server. We went with the beef combo ($18.99) of three types. That was enough for my mother and I. For veggies, you pull off from the conveyor belt. The plates are color coded and range from $0.99 to $3.59 each.   The meat was tender and great quality. Soup base was yummy. The tomato oxtail was the winner. If you want additional spice or make dipping sauce, there's a station for that.   I'm not a fan of the conveyor belt because it seems like fresh veggie items, no longer become fresh. Even though it has a lid, it's not the same. The conveyor belt can be annoying if you see an item and it passes you but no worries, because you can always order it from the server instead of waiting for the item to get to you again. The soup base is what gives it 4 stars.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed Chubby Cattle after all of our visits. We've been here so many times and it is that good!  Ok I'm going to tell you the only negative about this place - the parking sucks! They're in a plaza with many other restaurants. So if you get here on the weekend during dinner rush, prepare to circle around the parking lot or park elsewhere and walk it here. My suggestion is to get here early, maybe before 6pm and you'll find parking spots. Lunch on the weekend is pretty good as well.   Now onto the positives! Their tomato oxtail broth is so good and this is what I always get every time. They also will refill your broth if it's running out with the same broth you order. Some places just either add water or chicken broth.   The meat quality is so good! My husband's favorite is the lamb. Mine is the brisket and rib eye. We save some money by ordering the combo. It's plenty of meat for the two of us.   The other things you add on like meat balls, vegetable and noodles are all good. The price for those is pretty reasonable as well. You can always get them from the conveyor belt that go around the restaurant. My favorites are: udon, fish balls with roe, bok choy, Napa and mushroom.   You can also create your own dipping sauce. My combination is: sesame paste, garlic chili paste, ponzu, garlic and green onion.   I can't say enough great things about chubby cattle. It's one of the best hot pot places I've been to. You should definitely try it out if you're around.",

This place   provided me lots of satisfaction and fulfillment, except in one area.   The service was quite good and attentive, but because we told our server it was out first time here he WOULD NOT stop trying to sell us on some BS promotion they were having for the Kobe Beef and Halibut fillets. We told him no 2 times. But as my girlfriend's mom came back to the table from her bathroom break, the server came back and asked us a third time. Obviously he knew she didn't speak english well and took advantage of that to sell her on the \"delicious halibut/kobe beef at an amazing price\".  I don't mind trying to sell/advertise your product, but don't try to mask it with some Fake promotion. Also, We already said no! Leave us the F**k aloooone!",

We kind of just started pulling stuff from the conveyor that we thought would sound/look good with our Oxtail Broth. We also ordered the beef combo.   The broth was so wholesome and full of flavor. The thin sliced beef were so tender even with just dipping in the broth for some seconds. We got the same flavor in a shared pot but with a separation. We kinda wished we got two different flavors of broth so we could try. To sum things up, it was a pleasant meal and would definitely come back and even suggest this place to friends and fam who ask for food joints to eat at.",

Most hot spot places see a set price for, basically, everything you want. Here, you pay for, every, single, item. Even the broth you choose to cook in will run you roughly $5. All meats, veggies, noodles, mushrooms, etc., are charged separately and it quickly adds up. The food you do get is very tasty - especially the noodles. Just underwhelmed by what you get for the money.",

We were seated next to the conveyor belt with easy access to add additional items. Not all the seats have that access. We order the meat combo and vegetables and the burst of flavors exploded in my mouth. The meats were fresh and so were the udon and glass noodles. There is a serve yourself bar with their special sauces and what a great addition to the meal: savory and spicy.    I ordered the Jasmine green milk tea and it was the perfect sweetness for my dessert.   This place is located in China Town past the plaza and this was a great find, given there are so many choices to choose from in China Town.

It's as hotpot should be, and I like hot pot generally so its hard to mess up or be \"bad\" unless they serve poor quality meat/vegetables. I don't think its a life changing hot pot experience; I think there are better places out there in the West Coast.   This is not all you can eat; you have to order each item (things cost differently depending on the plate you choose).",

Bomb flavor on both, and the spicy broth really had that classic hot-pot 'makes you sweat' feeling. A very good thing!  On special, there was A-5 wagyu with egg(pictured) and Chilean sea bass. Beef was delicious and sea bass was really fresh.   To top it off, we ordered a-choy, fish ball with roe (yesss), fried tofu, shitake mushrooms, some quail eggs, and rice. Then grabbed some sauces and wood ear from the sauce bar.   I love how they have sauce combo recommendations on the sauce bar, it's really helpful to know which sauce compliments which meat!  Also, our server Deni was awesome! Came in the clutch with recommendations :)  Ps. Don't forget the soju",

He has been bringing dinner to my mom and late father for over 15 years every Sunday. A saint. But I digress.  The place was full on a Friday night, and the wait system was based on whether or not your party wanted family style hot pot or individual.  They recommend the two-broth pot for the family. You order meats, veggies and add-ons. You make your own dipping sauces from a bar with suggested \"recipes\". Although I will pick apart the down side, it was four thumbs up in the end.   Pros: ice cold beer, TASTY broths, wonderful wagyu beef, shrimp balls and housemade wontons.  Cons: poor maintenance of the sauce bar (dirty, needs a sneeze guard... really? Keep your kids off of this.), longer than needed wait from wasted space used on the bar and superfluous conveyor belt, nonstop poorly behaved kids, inadequate ventilation.   Next time: I'll probably go later in the evening. I'll sit closer to the door. I'll get one of the spicy broths.",

I would really be careful in choosing your 'hot-scale', the HELL is defaulted to the '6' out of 10. I honestly would have preferred to be on level 4. The taste of their soup was absolutely amazing, it was very very rich and it goes perfect with either seafood or the meats. The servers are quick and also helpful with the good mix in sauces that will pair perfectly with your dishes.  The meatballs are handmade per order, we got a lobster one and their house-special. Truly, I will return and probably bring my friends and family here. I would try to sit by the conveyor belt maybe for next time. Great spot, great location, great tasting restaurant!

    "text": "I brought my parents here to try it out with my husband and I really wanted to like this place. I was excited about trying it but, unfortunately it was a let down. Our first mistake was not making a reservation, when we got there I really wanted to try the conveyor belt but they had no room. The biggest complaint about this place is their customer service. The ladies at the front had difficulty communicating in English. I asked them if we could still get our own soup broths at the table and they said no we could only have 3. I figured that would be good enough since there is only 4 of us, but when we got to the table, you could only have 2 soup broths at most. The ladies are just speaking in Mandarin at this point, which annoyed me because my husband does not speak Mandarin so I had to translate everything for him. I also felt like the ladies out front had an attitude and just didn't really care.  They brought us a menu. Yes, just one for 4 people. I don't understand why. It should at least be one menu per couple? We went with the mushroom broth and the house hellishly spicy broth. We ended up ordering 2 orders of the beef combo, 1 vegetable combo, 1 seafood combo, 1 assorted noodles, and mongolian lamb skewers. So here is the weird part when we ask what is in the combo the server lists out some stuff and says if you are lucky there will be a, b, or c in it, for every combo. Isn't it kind of weird to have a combo be some kind of lottery system hoping you get lucky? Of course we just got the standard for all the combos. The service was just okay, they didn't really take away the plates we were done with.  I think the food was definitely tasty and fresh, with a reasonable price. I checked my credit card and we paid 127.49 for four people which I think is a decent price. I did leave 18% tip even though I felt like the service was lacking. My husband wanted to try to order the meats in the combo separately to see if there was a difference and made it a point to do so by ordering them separately by name, but our server just ended up bringing another combo, we didn't complain about it, just let it go and ate the combo. Our server came by and told us that if we give them a yelp review that we would get free ice cream. I declined, he seemed pretty shocked, but I am not about selling my reviews for rewards. He left quickly without asking us if we would like to buy any desserts. We waited for awhile, over 15 minutes and he never came back, not even to ask if we wanted our check. We ended up just walking up to the front desk to get our check.",

There's also a menu for you to look at with different selections of soup, beef, pork, chicken, & seafood. The prices are reasonable too, so it's not too unaffordable. There's also a sauce bar with all kinds of different sauces you can choose from and behind that is a complimentary side dishes bar with a variety of different Asian side dishes to cool off your palate. Another cool thing is that they a car window where you can see one of the workers cut up the fresh meat! & for the drinkers out there, there is a full bar! All in all, this is a great restaurant to take your family for an outing or just to have a yummy dinner!",

The interior changed a bit compared to when they first opened. It's still packed from the 1st time I was here. We sat by the counter and we had individual burners for our own hotpot. There were 3 selections for broths and a variety of meats, seafood to order. The rest of meats, seafood, vegetables are on a conveyor belt which was amazing idea. It's hard to figure out sometimes what you want unless you see it.   They had a buffet for sauces, create your own. When we were there they ran out of bowls to make your own sauce and had to wait until they bring more.   This is best comfort food for cold weather.",

This place is fun, crowded, and unique but still very pricey for hot pot! I do like their spicy hot pot soup, it isn't too spicy for me, but I am a spicy lover after all! They even have a soup selection for vegetarian and they have different flavored noodles bringing more uniqueness! There's also a little area to make your own dipping sauce, which is always a plus. They have a lot of variety and the conveyor built adds a nice touch. I didn't know, but there is happy hour that is buy one plate get one free. So make sure to see into that if you do go and want to save even a few bucks! The experience was good overall, but nothing overly amazing!",

The sauce station is the absolute bomb, I love the conveyor belt style of the restaurant, and I love the plethora of meats they have. You really can't go wrong with this place. I introduced this place to my family and now they're hooked. We go there for special events, or if we just feel like being fatties. The servers are really nice and accommodating and their playlist for music is pretty fun. I heard your Porter Robinson playing, good on you. I usually go for the numbing spicy soup base, and my boyfriend gets the oxtail soup. Both I highly recommend. I wasn't too impressed with the House Special base, but it didn't detract from the awesome food party going on in my mouth. Their handmade noodles are pretty legit, too. Love the green tea noodles.

I've been to a couple hot pot places--both ayce and not--and was happy with the variety of selections and quality of meat. The service was absolutely amazing from the host to the server and anyone else who came to help us. On a Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I got seated right away though I can definitely see this place filling up! We got a family pot so we could choose three flavors of broth (I would recommend house and oxtail broth because the spicy one was a little too much for me to handle) and chose the beef combo. Everything brought out was in perfect portions and even if you ask for more, it came out quickly. Plus there is a sauce bar where you can concoct your own dips or follow simple recipes to bring out the best in your food. Definitely one of my new favorite spots to eat in Vegas! Coming back again next time!   The only thing I would warn customers about is the parking lot. It fills up real quick but with so many great food spots in one plaza, that's bound to happen.",

LUCKY for us, we came at the right time and they had a few tables open.  We got some side room, so we were in there ourselves.  I was pretty happy with that since it was fairly loud outside.  It was a \"build your own sauce\" place, with a whole table with probably around 20 items to put in your sauce.  Options for hotpot broth is traditional or spicy, the ingredients had a HUGE selection of meats, vegetables, non-meat proteins, homemade meatballs, noodles, plus some!  We had only so much room to fit in our belly, therefore we chose the \"interesting\" noodles, basket of vegetables, homemade meatballs, and choices of meat.  We each had our own pot due to the tablet set-up.  I would LOVE to come back!!",

Then  the table to our left sat down not To long after us order and for their soup within 5 mins. What kinda service is that? Finally our soup came out. I order oxtail soup. Apparently it ran out and our server didn't let us know! His excuse was they ran out of the ox tail. But he didn't even check with the kitchen. Matter fact the soup wasn't even oxtail base it was tomatoes soup base. White rice ran out but hell the couple sitting across from us got rice. We didn't get ours. They didn't want to cook more per the server. It wasn't even close to closing time yet. Server should went to the kitchen to check himself. But instead he just assume and blame everything on the kitchen. Just because he was too busy taking orders. We were so annoyed we didn't even enjoy our food. I would ever go here ever again!",

Our waitress, Xiao Xiao, was very welcoming and kind.  Four friends and I had shared a pot of the original soup and mushroom soup. Both soups were flavorful and definitely warmed us up. We also ordered the beef special and sliced lamb; both were delicious!   SUN-THURS 9:30P-12:30A offer a BOGO Happy Hour. Our total ended up ranging around $80 for five people.   I look forward on coming again with my family. It's debatable whether I'd go on a regular pricing because it's pretty pricey!",

The conveyor is fun just grab what you want and the waiter counts the plates at the end. If it's your first time try the original broth or the mushroom. The beef and lamb combo for meat is very good.

    "text": "We ate here for the first time to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We are big fans of a good hot pot, but unfortunately up until now choices in Las Vegas have been very limited. Well let me tell you that all that has changed with the arrival of Chubby Cattle. This hot pot restaurant exceeded our expectations from start to finish. Fortunately for us, we made reservations prior to our arrival because it got crowded pretty quickly for a Thursday night. I think that speaks volumes about how popular the Chubby Cattle has become in the short time it has been here in Vegas. The interior of this establishment was well decorated, with the right amount of chic, but not over-doing it. Our booth seating provided more than enough room for the four of us. Unlike other hot pot places we have been to, this table had individual burners for our own hot pots. However it looked like they had tables for one big shared pot if that's your thing. Shortly after being seated, our server took our order for the types of broth we wanted (TIP: The \"mild\" spicy broth still has some kick to it) as well as our meat and veggie selections. The cool thing about Chubby Cattle is that, in addition to taking your order for the types of meats and veggies you want, they also have a conveyor belt (like Genki Sushi for those of you who are familiar with that chain) with other items you can pick from, ranging from varieties of mushrooms, to seafood, and quail eggs (honestly we weren't big fans of the latter but wanted to give it a try - YOLO!). They also took our drink orders (the watermelon drink was very tasty and refreshing) and shortly thereafter they brought out our individual bowls of soon-to-be boiling broths. So while we waited for our order to come out, we made our way to the sauce bar (which had an interesting pipe sculpture, modern art thing perched atop) to create our individual dipping sauces. They had a very good selection of sauces and spices to create our own masterpieces! After they brought the meat and veggies out, we set about the task of cooking them up in our own personal hot pots. I noticed that a lot of people weren't eating rice, which I usually like to have when I'm dining on Asian cuisine, so we didn't order any. Although it would have been nice, I suppose it's a good way to ensure you fill up on meat and veggies and not just white rice. After our bellies were full, a young woman (perhaps the manager) came to our table to ask how our dining experience was and we replied that we were very pleased. Since this was still a grand opening period, she offered us complimentary ice cream for dessert. Not being the types to turn down gratis dessert, we happily accepted the chocolate ice cream. Peanut flavored ice cream was also offered, but since that sounded a little too exotic for us, we just went with the chocolate (still wondering if it tasted like peanuts or peanut butter). Overall, dining at Chubby Cattle was a very pleasant experience, with great food and ambience. A little pricey, but when you're in the mood for hot pot, you almost don't mind. Happy Eating!",

Best part was that we sat right by the conveyor belt and made this experience even better! Thankfully, our server, Matthew, helped us figure out how to order and was VERY patient with us! I got everything he recommended (house soup, enoki mushroom, thick noodle, beef tongue and mango juice to drink), and everything was BOMB! Don't forget to make your sauce at the sauce bar! I made it just how they recommended for beef items, and it went perfectly with my soup! I also loved the idea of the conveyor belt coming around with more meat and veggies so if I didn't want a large portion of something off the menu, then I could just grab it off the belt. Be careful though! That belt stops for no one!!! Can't wait to go back here and try the other soup bases and meats!!!",

    "text": "I am normally not the type of person that likes to spend my own time writing a review as you can probably tell since this is my first review on this account. However, I just feel the need to express my concerns this time due to the way my incident was handled during my dining experience...  First off, this wasn't the first time I came to Chubby Cattle, I had no prior unsatisfactory experience here before until today. My girlfriend was craving hotpot so our first natural choice was Chubby Cattle since we both really enjoyed it previously. Our server Matthew had us seated and we began ordering like usual...  We normally never order any items from the seafood menu as we prefer their meat selection more but this time we decided to give their seafood combo platter a try since the guests next to us ordered one and the presentation was really beautiful. Along with that we also ordered some beef briskets, veggies and bunch of assorted items from their conveyor belt...  The dining experience was going nice and smoothly with service and most of the food being on point like usual. This took a dramatic downturn when the supposedly \"beautifully-presented seafood platter\" was brought to our table...  It had a assortment of shrimp, clam, scallop, crab leg, fish, and mussel. Anticipating the taste of this dish, we put a little of each into our broth and let it simmer for a good couple minutes. The shrimps and scallops was amazing but the RED FLAG comes when we go for the mussels...  I put a little of our sauce on top of the mussel and attempt to scoop the whole thing into my mouth as if it was a oyster. As I try to separate the meat from the shell using my mouth, I noticed a weird texture when I chew down on it, something I wasn't familiar with as I had plenty of mussels in the past. It felt really hairy and crunchy at the same time, so I immediately spit the whole thing back on the shell to see what it was that I bit into. I was thoroughly disgusted when I saw a bunch of black hairy leg-like thing protruding from the flesh of the mussel. I wasn't able to identify what that thing was. And from another piece I took out from the broth, I saw a random whole-small crab inside the mussel itself. Without further or due, I ended my meal there without finishing anything else from the seafood platter as well as what is in my broth.   I informed my server of the situation and all he came back with is that the manager said it was a natural occurrence as they are the things they eat...seriously? So I had to personally request to have the manager come over and told her that explanation was unacceptable. I mean come on, If I were to order pork intestine from a restaurant, I expected it to be thoroughly clean despite knowing what is consider as a \"natural occurrence\" that takes place in it.    She told me that the mussels are from a supplier at New Zealand and they were the one who supposedly cleaned and cooked it before shipping it to Chubby Cattle...but hey, how about doing some inspection on it yourself before serving it to your customers? It is only a standard process for the price you guys charge. Not to mention she also told me this type of incident also happened previously to other customers as well so all in all, this should bring a RED FLAG to you guys to either switch suppliers or have a thorough cleaning of such products when you receive them.   The manager kept trying to push the responsibility to other things instead of owning the experience. She did however apologize and say she will reflect my concerns to the team and said she will see if she can do anything for me. When my bill came nothing was altered, and I can see from a distance she just kept talking with her co-workers, laughing and chatting along. This just makes me feel like she wasn't sincere at all and that your management just doesn't care anymore. It wasn't until we told the server Matthew that your management said she will do something in regards to the bill that they then finally went ahead and removed the seafood platter (we only partially consumed the shrimp and scallop, everything else was discarded because we were disgusted) from the bill.    I work in the hotel industry in a 5 star luxury resort setting and I understand how important customer service is to maintain and generate loyal guests. With all due respect, I don't expect the same level of service standards from Chubby Cattle, but come on, your server itself saw those disgusting hairy legs coming from the flesh, it could be potentially hazardous as it is something unidentifiable. Trying to brush off and escape the situation instead of proactively dealing with it just tells me a lot about your company.   I had always suggested Chubby Cattle to my friends, family and numerous guests that come to our hotel when they ask if I know a spot for delicious and unconventional Asian cuisine. This is such a big disappointment...I don't think I am able to recommend this place anymore or even come back at all",

    "text": "Service was veeeryyyyy mediocre. Though it is expected from an Asian restaurant, there are a lot of upcoming Asian restaurants that have more modern style serving, therefore a better service. We had a reservation and they sat us about 20 minutes past so that was kind of crappy, a lot of their sauces/ toppings in their little sauce section was empty, and our server didn't really understand that we were 3 different groups (2 couples and 1 guy) so a lot of our food was combined. Which we reiterated it wasn't supposed to be family style.  The food, however, was AMAZING. Left extremely full. The homemade noodles were really good, the broth was amazing and very flavorful, my bf and I added brisket and the meat combo. And I got quail eggs, mussels (which I would definitely skip) and mushroom.   Altogether, I will be back. Just wish they cared a little more about their reservations, topping refills, and common sense with how we wanted everything split.",

I had the opportunity to try the brisket, ribeye, and pork belly. Ranking in that order just in case. There were other plates, not worth mentioning.   Hopefully the choices on the conveyor belt would change. The options/choices were the regular stuff you can get at 168. Can I byoi?  Bring your own ingredients? Charging an arm and a leg for my fav imitation crab meat.   I don't know if there would be a next time, easier doing at home. However was a very unique first time in this establishment. Had to try it out.",

The Chubby Cattle, literally translated as Cow Demon King, is one of the best.  Ingredients are fresh, and the flavors are delicious.  Do not spend extra on the fancy $25 Waygu beef.  We tried it, and it was no where as tasty as the ribeye at $9.99.  The large condiment bar has every flavor you want for dipping, but be careful or you will go home stinking of delicious garlic.  Negatives were - broken credit card machine forced me to drive to an ATM at 11 PM in Vegas.  Seriously, what self respecting business doesn't have a mechanical swiper?  It took about 10 minutes at 10 PM to find parking due to the packed lot.  You may consider parking near by.    Our second visit was smoother, with a working credit card and a much more varied edm mix.  We will be back.",

Plus, they have the conveyor belt option for veggies, noodles, tofu, etc. They also have a self serve sauce bar with a dozen different sauce/add-ins. So many options to keep your taste buds happy.   Zoe was a fantastic and attentive server. She always checked in to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.   Highly advised that you make a reservation through Open Table. Otherwise, the wait is about 40 mins.   If I had the money I would take this back to Los Angeles and franchise the hell out of it.",

My favorite was the tomato-based broth, which added nice flavor to the otherwise bland veggies. For the unitiated, I would advise that you first try Chubby Cattle with someone who knows the ropes and can guide you on how to make your own dipping sauce and what meats to order. It can be a bit overwhelming if you come in cold turkey, though the staff is friendly and can help a lot.  Biggest danger is choosing too many items with no knowledge of the price. It gets expensive fast and a glance at your bill can end up inducing acute indigestion. It's one if the reasons I tend to avoid dim sum.",

We were somewhat skeptical about this place and was having doubts that it may not be good due to our hot pot experiences in the past although this place had caught us off guard and it was tremendously delicious. They have many sauces from you to choose from to dip with your meat and other side of condiments, they also have a belt line conveyor belt that you can choose your side dishes to go along with your broth.  We left happily that we've chosen this place.  It definitely had hit our hot pot craving!  We were very satisfied and will come back again once we visit Vegas next time!",

However, I did think it repeated itself but I walked around and nope!! Not at all. ALL different sauce so I added each one into my bowl.   My favorite thing at the bar was the enoki mushrooms wrapped with beef was my favorite dish; we had to get two! We also got the lamb and beef which was good.

    "text": "Hot pot is something you don't hear to often in the Las Vegas foodie scene let alone Mongolian food. To my surprise, I was very excited about this restaurant opening especially finding out that they would have a conveyor belt full of various dishes.  The family and I decided on this place because we were pretty much Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Filipino out. We have been wanting to try something new and different for a awhile. Since I'm the designated unofficial planner for my family. I pulled up my Yelp account and came across Chubby Cattle that I bookmarked.  When we got to Chubby Cattle, the staff immediately greeted us and we were seated upon entering within 2 minutes on a Friday night. We got place with a table that was next to a conveyor belt, because not all seating arrangement have a conveyor belt. Our server Kwan, was very friendly and attentive to our needs and explained to us the concept. We decided on the Halloween Special Combo at the time since it was suggested by our server. We got a huge pumpkin carved out wit a variety of meats, shrimp & dumplings. Included was a bowl of various vegetables. I personally like the fact that the Hot Pot was built with a divider so we had the option of 2 soup base. One was tomato paste broth and the other was a mushroom flavor broth. Both were delicious and paired well with everything that came on our combo. There was a few dishes we added ala carte from the conveyor belt like quail eggs which happens to be a favorite of mine and my sisters. Overall the whole experience was amazing and definitely will be a topic for discussion with our extended family and friends. The cool thing about our dinner was how my parents actually enjoyed their meal. Even though they are biased with many Asian restaurants.   The only thing I noticed that could be improved on is their clarification of the menu. It could use more description of what is being offered and specifically how big of a portion each combo can feed. Plus the options of adjusting according to group sizes would be beneficial. However, everything was great and I would recommend everyone to try this dinning experience out!  Kwan, Thanks again for the awesome service! :)",

We got the beef and lamb combo and it was very good. For the two of us, we could have gotten two orders.   We also got the large fish ball order. It tasted like the regular fish balls you would find but they were 4x the size so I recommend you just getting the small. If we hadn't ordered the large, it wouldn't have been too much food. The large comes with 8 and the small comes with 4.     Very busy but service was great with our waitress Angela.  Very attentive and if you sit on the high top with other guests, there is no wait.

    "text": "My friends and i had decided to come here on a Thursday evening to try it out since it has been highly anticipated for a long while. We had heard rumors of Little Sheep styled Hot Pot would come to vegas and this was supposed to be it.  My friends had arrived earlier and had been told that it will be about an hour wait for the tables next to the conveyor belt because it is almost purely reservations ONLY and there was an opening in an hour. My friend had put her phone number down and we went to District One for a snack. About 1 hour later, we returned. The hostess states she tried calling and the phone number did not work. Another friend looked at the number and tried calling. Worked perfectly fine. Does the hostess know how to call out of state numbers on a land-line? Does she know how to use a phone? She doesnt seem to be much experienced on customer service as her attitude towards customers is very poor. No apology or excuse. Just chugged along like a headless chicken.   We waited another 10 minutes in the cramped space by the entrance with others coming in through the door squeezing behind and in front of us before we were taken to our table, which was still incompletely set up. The person setting up apologized for the incomplete setup, which was appreciated as it was not his fault we were taken to an incomplete table.   We sat around for 10 minutes before our server came up, asked for our drink orders, and brought us 1 menu. The menu's are designed non-traditionally and mounted to a paddle. So holding it is a bit weird.   While deciding on what to order, the waiter had asked us what soup bases we would like. But he said the house original and house spicy were out and only mushroom, seafood, and tomato were available. We had almost got up and walked out. The manager had came  up and said it would be ready in 10 minutes, if we were willing to wait. So we did. We had asked the server what the difference in size was between what was going around the conveyor belt, the combos in the menu, and the separate orders. He had to go get the manager to help us. The manager told us the difference was 5 oz and 10 oz for combo. The asian in us were highly confused as the math totally did not add up. It was about $11 for the lamb shoulder and beef brisket, as told to us by the waiter which the combo consisted, but it was about $17 for the combo. HUH!? An order had came to the \"window\" and he had showed us the size. It was a large plate with lamb shoulder piled high and he said it was a single lamb shoulder order. We thought, oh wao... Single order lamb shoulder is actually pretty decent sized at $5. Assuming beef brisket is about the same at $6. Manager seemed quite clueless too  We ordered 1 order of each, along with 2 large orders of watercress and napa cabbage, and a large order of fresh thick noodles.   When the soup bases had arrived, they had looked a bit \"clear\" to me and my friend. As we were quite used to the white herb-y broth from little sheep, this had surprised us. It had a slight transparency to it and not fully white. When i tasted it, it felt watered down and tasted more salt/msg-like. Thats disappointing. Smelled great ! tasted meh  We had got some oyster mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, glass noodles from the conveyor belt but nothing else looked good. One of my friends said some of the oysters look like they are going bad, as some were turning yellow. Selection-wise in the conveyor belt is quite minimal and seemed to repeat quite often, nor seem like many people are going for it either.   When the meats arrived. Give or take maybe 12 slices of meat per order and was NOTHING compared to the plate he had shown us earlier. The one he had shown us was on a round white plate, meat \"rolls\" piled high. Ours were on a long rectangular plate, with meat flat and layered. what the hell? we had asked about the size and the waiter said it is dependent on the slicer/worker in the back. I joked with one of my friends that we could tip the meat slicer and get quite a bit more. lol of cos we didnt do it but it was quite tempting.   The veggies did not look that fresh. Especially the watercress. Bunched together in a \"cup\", it was quite hard to \"separate\" to share and some parts were turning yellow. Napa cabbage was in a bowl, cut. Kind of hard to screw that one up.   Most disappointing was the \"fresh thick noodles\". definitely not fresh. nor were they thick. We LOVE the fresh thick noodles at Little Sheep. this is incomparable. in a large order, it was 3 \"bundles\" of noodles. all dried. and they had the thickness of maybe somewhere between angel hair and spaghetti. definitely not thick. Fresh? uhhhhh  In the end, our waiter had apologized to us as well for the confusion and minimal amount of info and knowledge he had. He stated he only started working there 3 days ago so his apology and willingness to help us was much appreciated.   Definitely wont be coming back any time soon, if ever again. Won't recommend anyone to try",

    "text": "When I was in Vegas back in April, I was looking for a good dinner option - preferably away from the strip. I had planned most of the meals during the trip but came up short one evening. Of course, I yelped and found this place. Fast forward to today and I still think of this place from time to time. After my meal, I remember telling my parents that this was the best restaurant that I have ever eaten at. I still stand by that statement today. The servers were great and explained in great detail on how to order and the customization that is left to each person since you can get your own hot pot! This worked out perfectly since my parents and I are like the three bears - my dad likes super spicy, my mom likes a little spicy, and I prefer mild. Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience. I have been to resolving sushi bars before so I loved seeing a conveyer belt used for hot pot ingredients. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who visits Vegas.",

    "text": "Hands down - best Hot Pot in Las Vegas! A new take on a classic Mongolian speciality. Modern Mongolia :)   I'm from NYC and have had tried my fair share of Hot Pot restaurants near the NYC/Queens boroughs. After spending time in Vegas for work travel, I was nostalgic for authentic Hot Pot.   Chubby Cattle is a modern take on Hot Pot cuisine. For me, this gem hits all the checks.   1) MODERN ATMOSPHERE. You can't beat a conveyor belt - such a novelty that I haven't seen elsewhere.   2) THE BROTH. I'm a big fan of spicy hot soup base. This place offers multiple levels of heat (different broths that were boiled over x amt of hours depending on the heat). Haven't yet tried the spiciest level, but definitely recommended. Aside from that, I definitely recommend trying their Bone Broth for those who aren't a spice fan and prefer creamier soups.   3) THE PLANTS! Cute mini terrariums everywhere!  Check the lights :)   4) SEAFOOD SELECTION. The restaurant offers a great selection of premium lamb and beef dishes. However, they truly shine in their special seafood offerings. Lobster, Jumbo sweet shrimp, and more - a perfect high end selection for those  looking to indulge.   Will definitely return with friends and family! A great spot for group dinners (they even have a private tea room setting).   Love love love! Only recommendation I would make is that they bring a location to NYC!",

    "text": "Great new hot pot concept in Las Vegas. We went two nights in a row. Admittedly, the poor reviews here on yelp are harsh, but True. We also experienced customer services issues. However, I wanted to write a positive review, because I know they are new and genuinely trying. They have only been open 3 weeks. While it is a bit disorganized, I appreciate effort and honestly. I would take that over staff who feel entitled and are rude.   Issues we had were with them loosing our reservation,  missing parts to our order, having to request things multiple times, and also servers bringing out food that was not for us. Also, if you order any combos, expect to play tetris with your plates, as there is an extreme lack of table space. This is all mainly a communication error, and I am sure the staff just needs more time to get it together. They all seem very nice. I do not like fake people. However, one can only be so forgiving as there are multiple choices in dining in Vegas, and top notch service should be expected. Actually in my opinion there are too many serving each table and they are too busy to communicate with one another, so you will be asked for your orders twice, you will be brought your orders twice... Like I said....communication is the missing link.  The food is excellent. Presentation is amazing. Everything was fresh. We did the seafood combo, beef and lamb combo, the fresh meatballs, veggie combo, and noodle combo. All were very reasonably priced.   Do check this place out. It is a very interesting concept. I believe it will get better. I hope it gets better, as I do plan on coming back!",

We've asked them a couple of times and they said we we're next after an hour. Another 45 minutes have passed said we we're next. 5 groups were seated ahead of us as they indicated they made reservations. It is sad to say we walked out because we were felt neglected as others are being seated. From a customer service standpoint, this is unacceptable. Other than that, their food is good but their seating system needs adjustments.",

    "text": "Last night a group of friends and I came here for the first time. The food was good, we were all impressed with the setup of the conveyer belt, and I was excited to recommend this restaurant to my family who I thought would enjoy it. I really wish I got the name of our waitress because what she did completely turned me off from ever wanting to step foot in there again. We were thanking our waitress as we were walking out and I did not think much of it that she did not really acknowledge us. But she kept trying to look past me over towards our table and I had a feeling she was looking for tip money, which was placed under the receipt. My group of friends were saying our goodbyes outside when our waitress comes out and what she does just BLOWS. MY. MIND. She starts demanding more money because she is not satisfied with her tip. She just stood there holding up the receipts and did not want to leave until she revived more money. All of us were completely shocked that she had the nerve to chase us down and harass us about a tip. Tip is not mandatory, so where does one get the nerve to be that unappreciative and ask for more? And why would anyone even think they deserved or would get more after acting that way?! The tip amount was good and fair for the service provided. Our group was not skimping out on the money. Even if we left nothing it would not be okay for her to do that. Our group should have talked to a manager but we all just wanted to leave. This was not acceptable behavior and I hope this is not the standard for how their staff treats customers.  I really created this yelp account just to share this bad experience. That's how much it bugged me.",

Yes it was tasty but the serving amount was enough for my 2 year grand daughter. I like the the concept of picking my own ingredients, which there was quite a selection to chose from. My husband wasn't too thrilled with the idea to begin with and he's still not thrilled with this place. Then we had to go pick our own condiments and appetizers from the bar. Let's just say they need to keep that area a little bit more tidier than it was. Choice of appetizers were limited to 2. They do have a conveyor belt around the general sitting area but since we were in a large group we were sat in a private room. They take your broth order first and once that arrives, the waiter comes in and takes the rest of your order. He takes everyone's order except for one of my friends. We had to go and find the waiter to finish hers. Then we asked for forks for a couple people and took me asking twice before we even got it. After all the orders arrived, we realized everyone got theirs except for my husband and my friend, who's order they originally forgot to take. This wasn't a good experience and the questions still remains... we me liking the food and the bad experiences we had, would i go back? Let's just say it'll be a while before I even consider this.",

    "text": "Hot pot is always a good option and this place was fun, full and delicious. We waited about 45 minutes at prime dinner time. I could see it getting longer as this place a little on the small side and it feels like hot pot is not an experience you rush. So after waiting and waiting, we finally got seated at a highbar with little pot areas. There are group tables, but we were seated in the individual ones. We decided one person to get the spicy (medium) and regular which was more bone broth tasting. We ordered many many items to go into our hotpot. Some were a success, some where not. The best success was the beef platter. My sister wanted to order two because she was hungry. One was enough for both of us. We ordered a variety of vegetables, head on shrimp, calamari and noodle platter. I would skip the calamari, it comes very watery and gets lost in the pot by the time it's cooked. The noodle platter was just ok too, different colored long noodles (red, green and black). I would just get udon noodles next time. The king mushroom, bok choy were delicious but the cabbage was overkill. I really liked the fried tofu as it absorbed a lot of the flavors. They will refill your soup if you ask, but by the time they refilled it, we were so full. One thing I would definitely do is skip the spicy soup and just get the regular one. I was not a fan or all the schechuan peppers. I'd rather have dipped it in my own hot chili or pepper sauce.  Their sauce bar was pretty awesome. About 20+ different condiments you can use to make dipping sauce along with a few suggested instructions. If you're a newbie or uncertain, go with the suggested sauce written on the bar. Also, they have fresh watermelon juice but I opted for a Blue Moon. We ended up spending quite a bit of money but I think it was because we were hungry and wanted the full experience. If you like sharing and soup, this is a great place.",

I went regular and happy hour  Happy hour is horrible- barley any sides to pick and just same ones keep rotating  Customer service is good but for $35 per person I would rather go eat authentic jap shabu with better meat quality",

He hasn't tried hot pot before, but he heard a lot of good things about this place. It didn't disappoint, he liked it a lot. Our server was Deni and he was pretty good! He told us that Chubby Cattle just opened a franchise in our hometown (Philadelphia) which got us pretty excited. They have the tastiest broths of all the hot pot restaurants I've been to. *Sorry Deni for the late review..",

Waited 20-30 min fir a table. The hostess was friendly & helpful, she even brought us a cup of water/tea. We ordered original broth & tomato broth. The original had an extra herbal kick to it, my tomato was delicious but I did add some chili powder to it. Conveyor plates were $0.99-$5.99. most items ordered from server arrived looking fancy. Surprisingly our beef tongue were only $6.99 and shrimps were $3.99 for 4 pc. I recommend the mushroom combo basket. It was our 1st visit and I already plan on coming back. I recommend it for a date! Fun place to eat, cook them yourself and don't be afraid to try new things",

Mind you, they open from 5pm-12am. We got here at 5:30pm so we were able to get seats quickly. If we came 15 minutes later there would be no more seats. This place was a hit! The broth was flavorful! We had 3 to our party and everyone had their own hot pot because a mini pot is built right into the table in front where everyone was sitting. And I loved the concept of the conveyer belt! I'm going to miss Hawaii, and if I'm every craving a little taste of home I will definitely come here.",

I love that it's an open kitchen and we can watch a little of what goes down. Theres a sauce station where you can create your own sauces..I think the only thing I prefer, is eating at a table where there's more wiggle room. There's a warm ambiance that flows through this place which is hard to find in a lot of restaurants. Definitely coming back.",

Everything was fabulous, and I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because there are only a few opportunities for improvements.   The mushroom basket, sea bass special, and Beef & Lamb plate were totally worth it.  I did find bones in the sea bass, though.  I don't recommend the Veggie Plate unless you really like lettuce and cabbage; you're better off picking up greens from the conveyor belt.   Deni, our Server, was really communicative and great at walking us through the menu. They have a conveyor belt that circles the entire restaurant that is really awesome.  It is hard to keep your hands off it while waiting for your soup. We each tried a different soup base, & all were very tasty.  We will be back again!",

If you keep in mind that part, you will for sure enjoy this place.",

I kept saying I didn't want it. 10-15 min later it arrived. It was not beef. This was lamb and I told her I don't want it. She said too bad we already cooked it. The manager came over and pretty much didn't care either and kept trying to convince me that it was beef. After that, the waitress never came around anymore.  When we got our check, the skewer was still on there. Very disappointing. I would of expected more from a manager then trying to convince me of something that wasn't True plus I waited almost 50 minutes for it. First Time there last time there",

From the service to the variety of selections, we were definitely pleased. She got the house broth & I got the tomato based broth, both broths were delicious & unique to the restaurant. Most places we go only have a few of the standard selections so it was unique to them. Their side dishes & meats had a variety that we were satisfied with. Also their price on the small dishes were fair - while we ordered small sizes for each of the dishes, it filled enough for both of us. If you have enough room for dessert - you have to try their green tea ice cream. It tastes like a green tea latte! Delicious.   Queenie - our server was awesome! She answered all our questions & did not bat an eye when we requested for anything at the table. The managers who walked around & assisted their team from cleaning to refilling water was surely noticed on our part.   A few things that we noticed - the communal dining table was a little awkward because of the space. If it's just for yourself or even two, it was ok. Considering how much we ordered individually, the table space for another group to share with us made for a bit of an awkward experience. In terms of their side dishes - we hoped for more variety with their fish balls & greens.    Overall, great experience & great food!",

    "text": "First and foremost, I believe their rating is a False high.  The server tells you about half way through your meal that if you leave a review on Yelp while you are there and show him at the end of the meal you will get a free desert.  He then tried to clear our food while we are still eating and asked if we were ready for our free dessert.  When we were finally done he approached us again about the dessert to which we replied we didn't want dessert.    The actual food was just ok.  The broth was a little boring, we both got the spicy broth, I got a little spicier than my husband.  There is a \"sauce bar\" which is pretty awesome that you can make your own sauces as well as a couple of prepared sauces.  At the end of the day it was just kind of a stressful meal experience.  You get very little room and they try to recommend a meat platter, vegetable platter and seafood platter; we didn't get the seafood.  There is no room to really do much and you are cooking your own stuff so you can't move much while you are trying to cook.  Not to mention if you want anything off the conveyor belt there is no room to put it.  We only got two items off the conveyor belt and both times didn't know where to put the dish.  There were two ladles in the broth, one regular and one with holes to scoop out the chiles and such.  The last hot pot restaurant we went to had a little container to put your utensils in which was very convenient as well as a pair of scissors for you to cut things up, something they might want to look into.    We've been to hot pot before, Yojie, and had a really good time.  Overall I think this place just doesn't do as good of a job, it's a little to gimmicky and hip.  I think it's way sketchy when you are pushed to do reviews in front of the staff, I wouldn't go back.  On a final note there was a very intense smell in there, kind of a cross between body odor and bad fish, I almost left before we were seated because of it, kind of wish we had.",

First and last visit to this place. Must accept some of the blame myself as it was my first experience at hot pot. Spent $60 for myself only. Interesting concept, but due somewhat to my inexperience, it just did not work. I overcooked the meat making it virtually inedible. Tough and tasteless (beef tongue and premium lamb). Shrimp were good, but I do not like peel your own. They were fresh as were the scallops, which were quite small. Best dish was the kobe fried rice, which was quite good but not great. Pass on the watermelon juice which was watery and served at room temperature. Blah!  Based on all of the Yelp reviews, I decided to give it a try and did but wished I didn't.",

You pay per plate including small items like lettuce, mushrooms, you name it. Our bill for two people was $80+ which is quite pricey just for hot pots. I personally think there are better places to eat for that price. It was decent but wasn't amazing. It's good to try but we wouldn't come back for it.",

    "text": "This was my first time ever trying a hot pot, and I chose this place specifically because of their conveyor belt attraction, which we all know is a very scarce find in Las Vegas.   Being a first timer, I was very overwhelmed by the options on the menu. The list was so extensive, I had no idea what was good and what wasn't, so it was one of those moments where I literally went with my server's recommendation. Gilbert, by the way, was fantastic, having a vast amount of knowledge on hot pot, and helped make my experience less intimidating.   I ordered a variety of meats on their list in the end, not really knowing what to try. In the end, I think I can safely say that the Beef&Lamb combo was the winner for me. All the meat was such great quality, sometimes it felt like a shame for me to put it into a boiling pot instead of grilling it. Haha.   On the other hand, this may just be silly old me, but I assumed that you don't really drink the broth because they gave us straining ladles, and there was no other utensil in sight for us to put the soup into our bowls. So yes, silly me, but also silly them for not giving us the right ladle (it was on my second visit where I learned you drink the broth too). It would've been helpful to know the first time before we spent a whopping $70+ on our meal, trying to get full but still left unsatisfied.   On our second visit, we brought family, a party of 7 seated in a booth for 6. There was only one pot to share among 7 people, which we all felt was very inconvenient and uncomfortable. We had the right ladles, at the very least. Perhaps consider adding a 2nd hot pot for tables accommodating to larger parties so they don't all have to huddle around one small pot.   Despite the inconveniences, I loved the piping broths and A quality meat of their hot pots to the point where I couldn't give Chubby Cattle any less of a score than a solid 4.",

Be careful with the hot&spicy one, it was too spicy!! The oxtail broth was the best i think, the original broth was pretty good. If you bring a non asian person like i did, they should stick with the safe tomato broth lol  The veggies were all fresh, the food was good quality over all. The condiment bar was excellent with green onion, cilantro, garlic, salt & pepper and alot other irrelevant ones that i didnt use lol i loved it tho, i kept going back to it.   The service was surprisingly great! Our guy was Deni with the man-bun. He was friendly & very attentive to our every need, i mean every single one, i had kindda a dumb \"accident\" that shouldnt be mentioned here. Deni made sure my 'need' was satisfied.  He was very patient with us first timer & explained it to us commoners lol it was a great experience, give them a try.",

So although I do enjoy a bit of spice in my dish, I usually start with the restaurant's original soup base for my first visits so I can taste their flavor without any other ingredients shadowing it. The broth was very flavorful with the right amount of seasoning and a nice herbal kick. Absolutely delicious! I'll have to try my luck with the spicy soup next time I come back.   As for the menu items, the restaurant offered a good selection of quality meat and seafood. My friends and I ordered a whole array of dishes ranging from beef brisket to crab and everything was fresh and presented beautifully. My favorite would have to be the Kobe beef and oysters. Highly recommend both!  I'm so glad my friend brought me to Chubby Cattle before I left Las Vegas! I'll be returning next time i return for sure. It's about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, so take a cab, Uber, or drive there yourself because it's definitely the place to visit for a good hot pot experience.",

I prefer beef, tendon and veggies over pork blood and duck flipper, but hey, there's something for everyone! The coolest part is that you can sit at the bar in front of a refrigerated covered conveyor belt and grab things as you see/want them. They keep track of your consumption by the color-coded plates. I really enjoyed the food! We were desperate to return but were dismayed that they only seemed to open at 5pm everyday. We were confused as we had been there at 2pm the day before. In any case, it's a fantastic experience and worth getting away from the Strip for!",

    "text": "This place truly exceeded my standards. I thought it was a typical hot pot restaurant that just opened up. I mean they do open at 5 pm everyday which is kinda late and they have happy hour from 9-12  They have a bunch of frozen dishes you can grab off the conveyor belt kinda like genki sushi in Hawaii! But basically you choose a broth (which they have like 5 types) and you choose your meat dish (beef combo) and you can choose your noodles (noodle combo) and you veggies.  My server was deni and he was SUPER helpful with explaining to us how to order and what is most popular and he was a very good server! He made our experience more enjoyable!  There's also a whole area JUST for sauces! You can go and pick all your sauces and they don't charge so you can try all of them if you want.  Half way through eating I thought I wouldn't be able to finish!!! There was so much food and it was so filling. I thought the bill would be over $100 since there was so much to eat.  Surprisingly the bill came out to $60 and for the amount we ate it was DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. This place is of course just another hot pot spot that just opened but it really beats all the other hot pots in town. This place has VARIETY, and not Just variety it has great workers, good atmosphere, good price point, and the food has NO MSG! Tastes fresh made straight from the kitchen. Definitely coming back for more! 5 stars!",

The spice flavors, the cute little conveyor belt. On the other hand.... I came and sat down at 9:10 in order to do the happy hour (Sun.-Thu. 9:30-12:30) they do not tell you that in order for you to do the happy hour you must be seated prior to that exact time. Well I ate quite a lot plus stayed awhile and was unaware so I was upset and asked to speak to the manager. Luckily the manager helped me out and I felt very bad for getting upset but I did greatly appreciate it. I just figured it was kinda weird as I come from working in the restaurant business... you should put it out or even tell your customers about that certain situation. However, in spite of the situation I could not give this place a bad review for something like this. I did enjoy it very much! I hope they open a location where I'm from. And rest assured whenever I'm in Vegas I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Finally came by, because of all the good hype! Unfortunately I wasn't able to sit by the conveyer belt of food. We got sat at a high table which was a tad uncomfortable as there wasn't much room for my legs. I HIGHLY suggest requesting to sit by the food conveyer  belt , as you can pick out the food/sides you want in your hotpot. And come on, so intresting!  They have an excellent variety of sides from meat, vegetables, and seafood. There is even a \"bar\" for sauces and small appetizers made available for you. It is self serve!  There is also an actual bar inside too. You get your own mini hotpot to yourself, and can choose from their chicken, oxtail, spicy, or a half spicy and half chicken broth. We did order a veggie combo, and wow. Its literally a basket of veggies! If you order it, its enough for 4+ people.  Service was a little slow, and our hotpot broth  took some time to come out. But they are more than happy to help you once you flag them down. I'll definitely come back again another time!",

    "text": "Despite the absence of conveyor belt sushi's in Vegas, they somehow have revolving hot pot. Go figure. For those who have never had revolving anything, here's the breakdown. Each plate is color coordinated by price and there's no limit to how much you can have. I mean, you pay for each plate, so no one will stop you. If what you want is not on the conveyor belt, it may be requested.   We picked up noodles, fish balls, and veggies. Clear noodles were the cheapest at $.99, while the fish balls were about $3   You choose your broth, meat and anything extra, like rice, you want to buy right away. Remember that broth is refillable so don't skimp on those slurps of soup. To fill your broth with extra flavor, there is an unlimited condiment station that is full of different sauces. My favorite has to be the peanut butter, garlic and peanut bits mixture with a hint of chili paste. The flavor was just perfect.   I walked out of there at least a ton heavier....but damn, it was so worth it! Don't forget to look into daily discounts. They have a great one for students!",

    "text": "This place has phenomenal service with high quality food. Not only that, but everything from the plates to the conveyer belt to the tables are clean!   Let's start with the food -- the broth has a divider that allowed us to try three different broths. We got the heaven, hell, and mushroom (the mushroom was my personal favorite). The heaven and hell pot is called yin yang and you can get that by itself also! The conveyer belt is CONSTANTLY packed with food and restocked so you don't have to wait forever which is a problem I've had in the past. I ordered wine and they do NOT skimp on the wine like other places do and actually know what to recommend. Their serving sizes for the beef and lamb platters were perfect for four people.   Moving on to the service, impeccable. One of the most considerate staff I've ever come across. They always came to refill all THREE of our broths and drinks. Unlike other restaurants that only check up on you when you wave them down. They explained the entire process for those of us that haven't been there and made the overall experience that much more enjoyable. The manager is also so great! We had a small hiccup with the mix up of food and she (sylvia) came straight out to fix everything and apologize. This is one of the only places that I've experienced this kind of genuine service.  Overall, this is a wonderful restaurant with a cool and friendly ambience. I would recommend this to everyone craving hot pot!",

Around 9:30pm the conveyor belt seems to stop in being refilled with new things and there is not much selection and starts to go bare. Next it would be wise to let guests coming in at that sort of time that a certain part of the kitchen closes at 10 and I wouldnt be able to order certain things. It took me so long to get a waiter that it was already 10.  We were never checked on if things were okay, though other tables were. The only time a waiter stopped by was to take our inital order, to drop off the order and when i stopped a waiter. Now the waiters in general are very nice. But I wish they would be a little more attentive. The 10 o'clock issue wouldn't be an issue in the first place.  Food in general, what little I was able to get was still good.",

If you said no, they will explain how it work.   The First thing to do choose your broth.. original, oxtail, tomato, spicy (3 levels) for individual pot also they have yin yang (1 pot for sharing with your party).   If you eat meat or seafood, they have chicken, beef, pork, seafood. You can order combo beef ($19) for your party, I believed have 3 differents type of beef in one plate and with only $1 you can choose your noodle (they have 3 different flavor..original, green tea, taro).  They have a menu alacarte for raw meat & other food like pot sticker or cook lamb or rice bowl dishes but the fun part, they have a conveyor belt next to your table ( which I like).You can grab anything you want, they charge each small plate depands of the color's plate. In that conveyor belt have vegetables, shrimp, scallop, beef ball, oysters, different types of mushroom, shrimp ball (have a surprise inside, REALLY RECOMMENDED delicious), quil eggs.   My friend like his tomato broth & I order spicy broth level 6. I like my broth but I wish they put all herbs like garlic, bay leaves and more other stuff in the pouch so it make us easy to grab out food because it is hard to find your food with a bunch of herb in the broth. Don't worry about getting not enough broth, they keep refill the broth for us.  They have buffet table style for your sauce to make your broth or dipping sauce like hot chili oil, sesame paste, green onion, minced garlic, cilantro, mushroom sauce ( HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!! You can mix with your rice) & other sauce also they have bachan like cucumber salad, beans sprout (kimchi flavor), edamame. Oh BTW rice is separate, 99 cents each.  It is fun place to experience with a bunch of people & yes they have bar",

Found out the following from their website: \"As a reformer of the traditional Mongolian Cuisine, Chubby Cattle is the first restaurant in the world to combine a refrigerated, conveyor belt-based hotpot with the finest traditional hotpot from Asia.\"  Now I knew what to expect after reading this.  The restaurant is located in a crowded strip mall.  Finding a parking spot during the peak time that we arrived was a challenge.  Once inside, we were seated right away.  We ended up ordering items from their menu.  Yeah, we did not try one item from their conveyor belt.  Got to say that it did look cool, though.  Everything was labeled nicely.  Depending on the color of the plate, prices ranged from $3.99 to $9.99  Tried two different broths.  The House Original and the Mushroom.  Personally, I preferred the Original.  The meats tasted so good cooked in that broth.  Also tried the Seafood Combo platter and Potato Noodles.  All good!  Don't know if I would return.  I am not crazy about \"cooking\" my own food.  It was a good experience, service was terrific, and the food was delish.  Give them a go if you are in Sin City!",

All the ingredients were fresh and beautifully presented. My favorite item on the menu was the Kobe fried rice. It was so delicious! It's truly a fun experience. Often it will be busy with a bit of a wait, but so worth it!   This Chinese inspired cuisine has the option to choose your dishes via a conveyor belt or directly through your waiter. It has a modern and trendy ambiance with decor that is welcoming. The smell of the food makes your mouth water while enticing all the senses.   The best part of this establishment is the service. The hostess was very attentive and sat us down quickly. Our sever was very friendly and attentive to our needs. She gave us excellent recommendations and made sure we were happy. Thank you Angela!",

It's fun and something different to try. Prices are a little high so not an everyday activity for us. Friendly staff. Not so clean restroom however the floor boards are loose and easy to slip.",

    "text": "Summary: Good: Everything about the food, staff, concept.  The slight bad: there's often a long wait, because it's a new restaurant and very popular.  Definitely worth a visit.  I've had a lot of shabu-shabu (Japanese style), but not as much of the Chinese style hot pot.  On a previous visit to this shopping center for a reservation at the Thai place (also great), we saw a long like outside Chubby Cattle, investigated, and discovered it had just opened.  Filed it away to try later.  A month later, still quite busy.  Showing up without reservations seems to mean a 30-40 minute wait (there are some good tea places nearby to wait for the call...); I don't know how hard it is to get reservations.  Well worth the wait.  Essentially, it is hot pot where you order meat from the waiter directly, and then use the conveyor for additional plates of vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, etc.  There is also a sauce bar to make custom excellent sauces (Thai fish sauce was my favorite.)  Quality of meat seems to be excellent -- tried the beef combination and beef/lamb combination, as well as the hand-cut angus special.  We also had skewers of grilled beef and lamb (also excellent.). Watermelon juice was a good accompaniment.  The staff were all very friendly and efficient.  Given that every seat in the restaurant was full, I was amazed how fast they were with food and drink requests.  Looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "Came here to meet up with a group of friends after work. We were all really excited to come try it out after hearing about it in the news and just wanting to try out a conveyor belt concept for hot pot. It was still relatively early in the night (close to 7pm), so parking was not too bad. Upon getting to the front of the establishment, they still had a red carpet laid out and the cut ribbon from their Grand Opening was still hanging out. There are two sets of glass doors you need to get through to get into the restaurant. Upon opening the first set, you are blasted with nice cold AC and the fragrant smell of hot pot. My stomach immediately grumbled. With an amazing welcoming smell like that, what could go wrong, right?..  Well, once we entered through the second set of doors, we were 'greeted' by the hostess with \"How many?\" and \"Do you have a reservation?\". We proceeded to tell her there were four in our party, and no, we do not have a reservation. She then says \"Well, I can seat you at a shared pot, away from the conveyor belt.\" otherwise, it would be impossible to seat us because there was \"a reservation at 7:15, another at 7:15, and one at 7:30.\" Then she walks off and it seems like she went to talk to some people at another table? I'm not sure what she asked them, but she came back and said \"It will be a 45 minute to an hr wait before I can seat you.\" Did she just go ask that table when they would be finished eating? I will never know. We gave her a name and cell phone number of a friend in our party, and the hostess told us to come back at 7:44. If a table opens up earlier, she will give us a call.  Fast forward to 7:44 we walk in through the double set of doors (blasted again with the nice aroma of hot pot. Stomach again, grumbles). There are a few parties standing around the crowded entrance waiting at this point. She looks at us, and asks if we are ____. We said yes, and she says \"I tried calling you, but it didn't work.\" and walks off. I looked on the podium where she had her reservation sheet, double checked the number, and manually dialed it on my cell phone. What do you know? My friend's phone immediately wrung. She then sat a party before us, and then brought us to our tables. After we got seated, a bus person came over and said, \"Sorry, I'm not done setting the table,\" and proceeded to finish setting it up. We received one menu with our party of four people. I looked around, and I see another party of five also only had one menu. Sure, we can share two to a menu, but four people on opposite sides of the table looking off of one menu? Nope.  We've had quite a few questions on the menu. What specific meats are in the beef and lamb combo? (lamb shoulder/beef brisket) What is the difference in weight between ordering a combo vs each item individually? (combo was $16.99, lamb shoulder was $4.99, and beef brisket was $5.99) Our server did not know the answer to the weight question and had to ask the manager, who responded with \"10 oz for the combo, 5 oz for the rest\"... Wait, what? That doesn't add up. Why would I pay $16.99 for a combo with 10oz of meat vs $9.98 for 10 oz of meat when ordered individually? Our party opted with the individual orders of meat, along with some napa cabbage, watercress, and 'fresh thick noodles'. The veggies were also confusing to order, as the menu listed 'small' and 'large' prices, which differed from the conveyor belt prices for the same veggie. Soup bases: We wanted to order their 'House Original' soup base and their 'House Hellish Spicy Pot' with Mid Level Hell 12 spicy. We were told by the server that they were sold out of the House Original as well as the Spicy soup bases. How can you be out of the original soup base? We almost got up and left then and there, but the manager came by and told us there will be a 10 minute wait if we wanted to get those soup bases. What's 10 minutes compared to the wait we've already had, right?  The soup bases came out first. I was surprised at how clear it was. It was a bit bland, but I added some garlic to it, so all was good. Can't go wrong with garlic! Next, the meats and veggies came out. For $4.99 and $5.99, I believe they give you a decent sized portion. Of course it will always be cheaper at a supermarket, but at a restaurant, the price wasn't bad. The quality of the meats were just average. I could get better quality elsewhere. The veggies were a bit on the not-s-fresh side, as some leaves were starting to yellow and brown. Also, when the 'fresh thick noodles' came out, they were dry and thin. I don't know about you, but 'dried' noodles does NOT mean fresh in my vocabulary. Items we saw on the conveyor belt when we entered were nowhere to be found once we got our soup base. Keep an eye and restock it please!  When we asked for our bill, the server apologized for his lack of knowledge, as he started working three days ago. All in all, it was an interesting concept to try, but I probably will not be returning any time soon.",

However if you can't eat spicy food I would not recommend the spicy broth even at entry level. I can eat pretty spicy food and I was dying when I was using that broth, but thank god my friend got another one. Our server Matthew was great! Everyone in the restaurant was very nice as well. It takes a lot for me to write a good review about a place, so that means if you're reading this you should most definitely try this place! I took off one star because the sitting situation is a little all over the place, but nothing a reservation can't fix. Also they have pictures of cows in the restaurant which made my friend and I feel kind of uncomfortable, but overall you'll love this place if you love Chinese hot pot!",

    "text": "TL;DR - The food is absolutely incredible and the hot pot + unique conveyor belt set up makes dining here a fun, upbeat experience. As a completely american white guy, I HIGHLY recommend. It was very accessible to even a typically American palate while some of my friends got authentic looking hot pot food. Seems great for groups of 4-6 on the regular tables w/ conveyor belt (which I was in )or groups of 6-8 on the \"served\" tables. I think I saw a private room too but not positive about that  I ordered the original soup base and it was absolutely delicious. After I was seated I got one of the pre-made sauces from the custom dipping sauce station and I pretty much started eating the sauce straight before I got any food. It was a peanut type sauce that I could have eaten bowls of (diet though). Some other reviewers describe the soup broth much better than I can so just go read their descriptions. Only had the \"original\" broth but I have confidence the others are just as great.  The decorations made me laugh too - there's a hip mixture of hangin plant and pictures of cows in pastures... probably supposed to relate to the name Chubby Cattle! There were plenty of TVs too that had sports on. Not too into that but I had a great view from where I was sitting.  My friends and I have had hot pot a few times before and the conveyor belt added a whole new element to the dining experience. We even got a huge basket of mushrooms in a cool wooden basket that looked out of Lord of the Rings. ABSOLUTELY HAVE to try this place asap :D",

The entry level hell was a lot more spicier than we thought. The flavor was good but less peppercorn and chili pepper would be better. The sea view and house special were both delicious. The conveyer belt could use more veggies and the price is expensive for what it's worth. I would come here again, but only if my budget allowed for it.",

If you don't then you must order everything from the server. Our server Xiao Xiao was really nice and explained  the process of everything from the beginning. Only thing I would changed is the size of the counter at the belt area as it was a little small with all the food being ordered. Other than that.. this place was great !! Would come back again.",

The have a nice infographic on the menu that explains how to cook everything.   I had the entry level spicy broth with some Chinese yams. It's similar to kbbq but you cook the meat in a broth instead. For meats I had the lamb shoulder, ribeye, shrimp and wagyu. Everything was good.   If you write a review you become a \"member\" and they give you impressive discounts on your broth as well as a free meat every day.",

Way more fun than just reading things in a menu. The staff was so nice and helpful. When we got there , I was actually asked if I minding waiting ten minutes for happy hour - OF COURSE NOT- I LOVE DISCOUNTS! and their happy hour is great- most everything was two for one! They also have a dipping sauce bar where you can make your own sauce by adding all sorts of ingredients. They will help you if you don't know what you are doing- don't worry. There is a large variety of yummy things and it's great for vegetarians too.  I will be back!",

    "text": "Went to this place twice because I liked it enough the first time to come back again - the second time with my family (a total group of 7).   FOOD: I really enjoyed this place because of how many options you get given the conveyor belt. You start off with a soup base - the first time I tried the spicy soup base which I didn't like too much but 2nd time I got the tomato soup which reminded me a lot of Thai tom yum soup yum! We ordered the beef combo which comes with a generous amount of meat for around $17. My go to items for the conveyor belt are the rice cake, tofu, and fish balls but haven't really had the chance to try everything. All in all, I understand how people can get lost or feel overwhelmed with the menu.   SERVICE: Main reason for a 3 star rating instead of 5 is because of how my family and I were initially treated when we came in. We came in around 11:30p looking to try their buy one get one on the conveyor belt stuff. When we came in, I told the host we had a party of 7 and a lady said \"Uhhhh 7?\" And continued to quickly walk away saying something I didn't understand. Right when we were seated, the same lady told us that we need to \"please hurry and order quick\" because the kitchen closed in 10 minutes. What? Your hours say you close at 12:30a? Then, a male server approached our table immediately and asked us if we were ready to order even though we weren't even given menus yet! He then started to tell us that they weren't doing the buy one get one special since it was a holiday, but it was Dec 29? By this time, I was so annoyed and ready to leave but decided to stay since we drove all this way and was really excited for my family to try this place. The male server then continued to tell us that we need to hurry because their kitchen is closed and I asked if we could still get stuff from the conveyor belt and he said they were closing it down very soon and we may not have time. So we quickly got our food from the conveyor belt and during this time, we were told multiple times by the same and different people that they closed in 5 mins. Ok, ok I get it that's why we're rushing. The lady came back to our table and asked \"did you order yet??\". I was shocked - your hours say you close at 12:30. Keep the kitchen open until then or change your hours! I know not to expect much in terms of service for restaurants in Chinatown but this was just unacceptable.",

Just have to be careful, it's so easy to just pull played off the conveyor belt that you don't realize how much it all comes out to.  Otherwise it's pretty decently priced.

Mei was an excellent server and she suggested the shrimp paste. Definitely try it  We also shared 2 beef combos, 1 seafood platter and one mushroom combo. It was more than enough food for us.

    "text": "This restaurant really was an experience. It was unique from other hot pot restaurants. I will definitely return to bring my friends and family!  TABLES: You have the option to sit at a table with one large pot for everyone to share or you can sit at a table with many small pots for each individual to have their own (you'll have to let the host know before you sit down so they can give you the right table). Private rooms are also available. Make reservations or come after 9pm because this place gets packed!  ASSEMBLY LINE: In the center tables, there is a refrigerated assembly line of food the goes around a large portion of the restaurant. Customers have the options to open the refrigerator sliding doors to get the food right at their table. The food items are priced based on the plate color. My advice, stick to the menu, nothing from the assembly line is good.  SAUCE STATION: In the center of the restaurant, there is a sauce station for you to create your own sauce. I was amazed by the variety of their sauces. The peanut butter sauce is my favorite!  HOT POT/FONDUE: For hot pot, you have many options from the menu. It first we though it was going to be over priced, but after looking at the menu and seeing the portions they gave us, it was actually a pretty decent price for the food and experience. SOUP BASE: For the soup based, choose the tomato soup or the spicy soup. Avoid the mushroom soup! MEAT OPTIONS: For meats, you have to try the mouthwatering brisket. They recommended the rib eye, but it's no where near as good. For the meats, they are freshly slice to order. SEAFOOD OPTIONS: Now the seafood, if you want to try it, go for it, but my opinion, stay away from ordering seafood, it's not that good. I had the seafood special, it was very pretty in presentation, but nothing was good on it. You can also order the seafood individually. SPOON OPTIONS: They have various, meats and seafoods served on a spoon that you'll cook in your hot pot. It looks pretty, but it's a waste of money. VEGGIE OPTION: We got a veggie basket that included all the different veggies and it was really good. You can also order the veggies seperately.  DRINKS: They have a full bar if you want something to pair with your hot pot. The hot tea is served in a genie like pot. They offer various fresh juice. The mango juice was really good!  SKEWERS: They really advertise the skewers, but it's not that special. I'd advise just sticking to the hot pot.  DESSERT: THEIR ICE CREAMS ARE SO GOOD AND THERE ARE REALLY GOOD FLAVORS.  SERVICE: The host/manager Alex is extremely friendly, very organized, and hard working. He really makes his customers' dining experience a great one. Our waiter Kevin, was very diligent and he really knew the menu well. However, Kevin has the tendency to talk to you while you're eating and sometimes, he needs to give his customers the opportunity to eat. Everything was organized and it was a fun and relaxing experience. After coming back to this place, I have to say Matthew is my favorite server:)",

    "text": "Lets first say that the reason this place is getting decent reviews is they are either bribed (with ice cream apparently) or, they are getting stars for a gimmick - namely the conveyor belt.  If we talk about food quality, service, price this place gets demerits in all three:  Food Quality:  I tried nearly every type of beef and lamb they had to offer - and frankly they were just ok. The sort of OK that you'd expect from an AYCE hot pot place, except this place isn't. In fact, if you travel two miles to the palms, there is an AYCE hot pot place that blows Chubby Cattle out of the water - the quality is good, and theres even more variety of vegetables and meats to choose from.  The broth, which is critically important in a hot pot place was just okay. So far, no one has lived up to the pretty mild standard of Little Sheep (I wish we had one of these in vegas!)  Service: Service was pretty bad, but I did go opening week so perhaps they will work this out. Slow to check up when I was out of meat (which you can only get via ordering, because the conveyor belt only carries small items like little pots of veggies or small things like an oyster).  Price: Way too expensive. I ended up leaving having spent around $80 for myself, trying all the items I wanted and actually was not that full. Each plate of meat costs like $10 (or so) and only comes with perhaps 5-10 thinly cut slices. I would've rather gone to any of the other hot pot places in town, namely the AYCE at the Palms or Yojie and would've had a much better meal for my money.  Long story short: This place is okay, but its overpriced. The service wasn't great, and you have tons of better alternatives: namely AYCE Hot Pot at the Palms which has better service, better food, better price, better options, or Yojie (which is more japanese style) but has significantly better quality.",

The decor is beautiful and the place is well ventilated and bright. There is plenty of seating and I was seated promptly.  Our service was spectacular. This being kind of my first time, our server James was very patient and friendly when taking my questions. He explained the process and the food items, and took the time to wipe the glass of the conveyor belt line which condenses up pretty quickly. He checked up on us frequently and made sure our water was always topped off.  We had a large table for the two of us. We got a split pot, half mushroom soup base and the other their \"Heaven and Hell\" spicy base at mid level heat (it was too hot for me!) We enjoyed the brisket, beef tongue, and angus beef. All were delectable, especially the hand cut angus steeped in the Heave and Hell. We turned to the conveyor belt at our side for our add ons and everything was great and reasonably priced.  Tl:dr great times and I posted to share the experience and get half off my soup base...which I should get next time since I am in the loyalty program now. Woot!",

    "text": "Came here with my friend on a Monday night to try this conveyor belt hot pot themed restaurant. The inside is nice. They decorated it for the Halloween theme right now. There's bar seating and table seating with a conveyor belt of raw ingredients floating by for your hot pot. There's also a sauce bar off to the side where you can build you own savory dipping sauce.   When we sat to order the waitress explained how this restaurant works. Its individual pots per person. You get to pick the broth and spicy level. Each broth is 3.99 to 6.99 depending on type and spicy level. Next you order all big items, meats, veggies and hand made meatballs from her. The items on the conveyor belt are smaller items like mushroom, bean curd, tofu, raw fish, veggies etc. So for the two of us we got the meat combo, veggie combo, and on her recommendation, the small portion of the shrimp paste. From the conveyor we got the beancurd, quail eggs and fishball with roe inside. My friend also got the mango juice and a bowl of rice. The flavors of the broths were good. Very flavorful. They are also very generous for refilling it. I thought the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Meat was good, veggies were good.   The reason why I give this three stars is for the price. For the two of us it was 80 bucks total. That's a whopping bill for hot pot. You might as well go to an all you can eat hot pot restaurant for less than 30 bucks a person. They charge you for everything.. Broth, rice. Don't think I'll have the urge to try this again.",

Despite coming on a holiday, the host was very responsive and the wait was only 20 minutes without a reservation. After the short wait, we were promptly seated and provided with the holiday special; however, we decide not to drink so we ordered off the regular menu instead. Our server, Deni, was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the hot pot process.   We got the original and mushroom broths, beef brisket, rib eye, and premium lamb. We also got additional items off the conveyer belt. Everything we got was tasteful and fresh. The atmosphere was very social and contemporary with a hint of traditional Mongolian culture.   After being seated, we noticed that the restaurant soon got more packed, leaving multiple customers waiting. We were lucky to only have to wait 20 min but other people had to wait much longer and it took a while for us to get our check at the end of our meal. Other than that, we had a splendid experience and will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Chubby Cattle might be the new \"Hot Spot for Hot Pot\" and rightfully so.  The new restaurant is beautifully designed and offers aesthetically pleasing dishes ready to be cooked table-side.   After choosing up to three different broths along with your meat or seafood selections, a create-your-own sauce station provides a multitude of flavors to mingle with your tastebuds. If that isn't enough, a conveyor belt full of variously priced items may tickle your fancy.  My fellow diners and I chose two broths:  \"House Original\" and \"Heaven and Hell\".  I thought their House Original (beef/chicken stock) had a light, subtle flavor but perfect for sipping on.  The spicy broth was was actually a bit too spicy even for me and also a bit too salty for one of our friends dining with us.     The meats we cooked were delicious and the many dipping sauces elevated the taste.   My wife ordered some scallops which pretty much got lost in the mix of broth, noodles, veggies and meat; probably a first and last time to order those.    Similarly, we felt like the conveyor belt items were lackluster.  Assorted vegetables and tofu looked unexciting and didn't seem necessary to enjoy the meal or make it better.  Beyond that, our only wish is for them to serve some nice beer to go with the food!  Our servers were very helpful and did explain their restaurant concept fairly well.   Waters were filled promptly and the food came fairly quickly after ordering.  If you're craving Chinese hotpot in the Chinatown area, you can't go wrong by checking this place out soon!",

We were fine without the noodles and were able to get a tin of rice instead. Food was very good. I enjoyed the playlist they were playing. We were expecting more people during lunch on a Saturday, but it definitely wasn't as crowded as we thought it'd be. It's a very unique experience and this was my second time trying hot pot.",

We ordered the family pot which is one pot for 5 people to share with half original soup and half mushroom. We all agreed original was best. The sauce bar was awesome and something Little Sheep doesn't have. I made my sauce with ponzu, green onion, cilantro, chili oil, sesame oil and garlic. So tasty!!  Ambiance: clean and casual with loud music. We only used the conveyor belt once to get extra corn.   Service: super friendly. Kwan was our server and spoke both English and Mandarin Chinese which helped with my in-laws. They were good with water refills.   Cost: $80 for 5 people.

Loved the combination of 'cook it yourself at your seat' with 'here, add from the conveyor belt if you want as well.'  MANY choices of soup base, tons of options to customize your meal.  One drawback is that this is not a speedy process or a quiet one.  If you are trying to socialize AND are hungry, not your best choice.  If you want really good, really unique and really personalized - this is your place.",

The two large screen tv is entertaining. The location is always busy. Their broth is genuine and unique.   Maybe my \"Wow\" eyes is gone about this place. I'll admit their sauce bar and broth is worth praising for. I'm starting to realized it's a bit overpriced. The seating is crowded. I would recommend the table with the individual pot for a roomier comfort though the padding is weak. The server tends to forget to check up for additional order, drink, etc. The \"entertaining\" tv's are distracting. The restroom needs maintaining. Sticky floor is just a disgusting feel.   Thank you Chubby Cattle, I think I'm going to discover other places for a hot pot and set up my own in my home as well. It was a wonderful experience.",

They have two vegan friendly options. One is a tomato broth and the other is a mushroom broth, however the mushroom broth is finished with a chicken oil or something, which our server did inform me about, and which is easily eliminated.  It's also conveyer belt style, so if you see something going by that you want, you just grab it. It would be nice if the items were labeled though. And not every item that's listed on the menu is on the conveyor belt, so feel free to order those items from your server. You would also order any meat or seafood from your server as well. There's also a sauce bar so you can make your own personal sauce which really helped my broth too!  I was impressed with all the different veggies and tofu options - really good shit for my vegan self!  After I ate here, I couldn't stop thinking about hot pot for weeks.

Service - excellent service and they explain everything very well.   Good choices. So many choices in Veggies, beef, chicken, sheep, seafood.   Sauces- you can be the creative chef and make up your own sauces concoction at the sauce bar. However the bar is easily crowded with just two people so be prepared.   The broth - We tried the Original and the Mushroom and both were very good.  The chain trailer conveyor belt of food- an awesome idea, but I found it to be a bit too complex. Why not make it all one price and so we don't have to think?  Everything is very good here, just that when we were here, everything seemed a bit rushed, a bit busy, and I was not relaxing. The sauce bar was getting to me as it was simply too crowded with people kind of pushy and that is a real turn off.  I would give it a solid 4 but I need to go back and try it again. For some reason the four of us were just \"okay\"    Definitely try it out. I am in search of my new favorite hot pot place.",

This may be an exaggeration but there's probably one hot pot place every 3 shopping centers there and I've tried a fair number of them. Food in Vegas doesn't really compare to food in LA with the exception of Chubby Cattle!  Let's start off with the soup broth first! We ordered their house original broth and it was g-r-e-a-t! It was full of flavor. You could taste the herbs and the richness of the animal bone in every bite. As the soup boiled down their waiters were very responsive and came back to refill us every time. Their meat selection and seafood selection was really good. The beef tasted fresh and their seafood looked fresh (personally didn't try any). Their selection of veggies was a bit limited but they made up for that with some <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> house made noodles!

Apparently after 9:30 PM (which is when their happy hour starts), there's no new plates will be added to the conveyor belt.   They claim themselves as the conveyor belt restaurant but during happy hour, people will be force to order from their menu cause there's nothing left in the belt!   Disappointing and probably will not come back.   ------------- Loved the food here. The original broth is the best choice IMHO. Mostly because it will not overpowering the taste of items you put in the broth.   The conveyor belt experience is definitely why I keep coming back :) so fun and so many choices!!  If you can ask for Kwan. He is the best server here!  Also upon giving a Yelp review, they kindly give a free ice cream/dessert   -------------  A very fun experience. LOVE the conveyor belt!! Too cute. Just wish the windows are clearer (maybe use anti-fog?) so we can see the items better but it's okay. It might be good too to put names on the dish. Cause some people might not be familiar with the meat/fish/seafood balls.   We got the meat combo. It was so good (big too). I love the brisket the most. We also got the combination of house special balls. The best I thought was the spinach cuttlefish one    Kwan was a very nice waiter, explained to us the process (belt and sauce station).   We will come back! And bring friends",

    "text": "Ive been to chubby cattle a couple times now. Each time never dissappoints. We were immediately seated and waters came out. This was a friday night and it seemed unusually empty (maybe because it's a little hot in the desert lately).   We chose our broth base; my friend got the spicy broth and I got the tomato broth. I got some sauces for my pot; as the soups arrived I started to take items off the conveyor belt. Most items were about $2.50. Its fairly inexpensive. You can order items off their menu as well.  There is a plethora of options; plenty of proteins to choose from as well as a myriad of vegetable options. I had fish balls, mushrooms, bok choy and meatballs add to my broth. I usually order the menu for some fine thinly sliced meats but wanted to just try the conveyor belt this time.   I was happy with all the options. The service her has always been great for me. It will remain as my go to places in Vegas. Join their membership to get $5 off broth! haha.   I'll be sure to come back. Thank you Chubby Cattle!",

They have verity of foods to choose from (menu as well as rotating table) and everything is very good.  Definitely a spot to try if you are a foodie and not afraid to cook your own meal ;) I believe our server's name was Deni. He was very helpful and super nice!  My birthday friend got a free shot and a slice of chocolate mousse cake (which was delicious!) Highly recommend to try if you are looking for something different and out of the beaten path (for an American anyway...)",

We sat at a shared table so we only had one big pot of broth, but they have dividers. We asked for the original broth and the spicy broth. The waiter warned us the spicy was probably much too hot for us and instead brought us out some hot sauce base to mix in ourselves. It turned out perfect! Our favorites were the beef, shrimp, and udon noodles! Although everything we tried was great which included lamb, scallops, cabbage, pork belly, mushrooms, and a few other random veggies. The sauce bar is extensive and they have some suggestions on how to mix up a tasty sauce. I loved their beef sauce concoction. I would definitely come back!",

We came in around 5 on Memorial Day and were immediately seated. Our table ended up trying the ox tail tomato soup, and the entry level spicy soup- both were delicious! FYI on the entry level spicy soup, it packed a moderate amount of heat.  We tried three combos: beef, beef & lamb, and seafood. All were great, and our server Deni was very attentive. We never had to ask for any napkins or refills. The sauce bar also had a wide variety, and our favorites came to be the spicy mushroom and the ponzu sauce. I also tried the coconut milk mojito which was amazing. This was a fantastic dinner, and I only wish the east coast had more restaurants like this!",

What impressed me was the good selection of lamb and the good service.  Everything else was mediocre. The soup base (original) is similar to the little sheep Mongolian hot pot soup. It was good but nothing spectacular.  I was disappointed at the beef rib eye which was super dry.   Also annoyed how they only put one small pot in the middle of a booth meant to sit 6 people. It was kinda hard to reach the pot if you are sitting on the edge.   I guess I just feel there are more comfortable and tasty hot pot I've tried before.",

    "text": "Went here with friends for dinner and had a good experience! It's been a while since I've had hot pot and figured with the cold weather it was about time!   The food was pretty good, but my main complaint with this place is the lack of sets or combos. You basically have to order each ingredient separately which allows for customization to the max, but for people like me, it just takes more time to figure out what you want. You gotta be careful too since the price can rack up pretty quickly! I ended up playing almost $30 for my individual broth, beef brisket, 2 side orders of noodles, and 2 side orders of mushrooms. I wasn't full after my meal, but the food was good and at least the sauces are free XD. I like how they have some ingredients like veggies, mushrooms, noodles, and oysters on a conveyor belt so you can grab whatever you like.  It was kind of hard to understand the waiter due to his accent, but he was very nice. The wait staff could check on us a bit more since they stopped coming towards the middle to end of the meal. We had to flag someone down to get a refill on the broth.  Overall I'd recommend this place for hot pot if you are around the area. It can get a bit pricy so try to go during happy hour when the conveyor belt ingredients are buy one get one free. I wish they had sets you could order so you can get a bunch of things at one price.",

We asked nicely to be seated by the conveyor side before visiting by the phome and confirmed but when we arrived there even though 2/3 of the restaurant is empty  telling us to seat at the bar.  Very bad way to treating customers. I will NEVER go back here.",

    "text": "Overall: If there were a Chubby Cattle in Southern California, I might actually get hot pot more often. They have solid soup bases and fresh food at a decent price point for a build-your-own hot pot place. It's more of a 4.5, but I am rounding it to a 5.  Food: 4.5  How It Works: You pick a soup base, which is priced per person, and then you order protein, veggies, and noodles to put in your broth. There's a bar for you to get condiments, including sauces and garnishes.  House Original Pot: This is a traditional broth with dried jujubes, Chinese herbs, corn, and a few other veggies. It might not be for everyone because it does smell and taste a little like those Chinese herbal medicines, but I thought it was nice on a super cold night. Tip: Add a little fried garlic and green onions to round off the flavors.  Assorted Mushroom Pot: As it name states, it is a broth made with an assortment of mushrooms. This is one of my favorites because I love mushrooms.  Dragon King Seafood Pot: If you love seafood, this is the broth that you should pick. Their online menu has 3 different choices as 3 different price points, but they only had 1 choice ($6.99) on the day that I visited.  We ordered Beef Tongue, Seafood Combo Platter, and Veggie Combo Platter. All of the food was really fresh. I definitely recommend ordering the platters to share because they are a better deal and they allow you to try a decent variety if it's your first time. We definitely did not spend a lot (~ $60), but we were stuffed.  ALSO, the owners gave us a free order of wagyu beef because they found out that we were visiting from a different state. Yay!  Service: 4.5  Our waiter was very patient with us and even made some recommendations to help us save money because it was our first time. However, I wished that he explained the restaurant concept to us in a little more detail. He did not explain the conveyor belt or the sauce table to us, so we had to figure that out on our own.  However, the owners do seem to care a lot about what their patrons think. A woman, who I assume is the manager, stopped by to ask us about our meal. She also promised that they would read any comments that we left on their comment sheet or on Yelp. Hopefully, they actually act upon the input that the customers give.  Ambiance: 3.5  The restaurant is located in a quiet plaza not far from the Strip. Even though we came fairly late (~9 pm), there was still a short wait of about 20-30 minutes. I believe that they have a couple of private rooms in addition to the common dining area. The restaurant is pretty cute and decently clean. However, the restaurant could benefit from better ventilation as the smell of all the broths can be slightly overwhelming when you first step into the restaurant. Furthermore, the bathroom is surprisingly dirty in contrast to the restaurant.",

    "text": "Awesome idea! My mother and I had a fantastic time at Chubby Cattle! The service was phenomenal and the experience was just so much fun and like nothing I've ever done before!  You can eat as much or as little as you like. Just choose your hot pot broth, select some meats of the menu, grab some sauces from their sauce bar and pick and choose the plates as they roll by on the conveyor belt. Hungry for more? Then just keep grabbing those plates and they'll tally the plates up at the end. (If you're wondering how much each plate costs, just check out their little plate key below every window).   My mother is in from Texas and she loved the experience and can't wait to go back. Besides just having a great time, the staff were all very helpful and super nice and attentive. Kind of rare for a Chinatown restaurant to be honest so it was greatly appreciated.   Would I go back? Absolutely without a doubt! Would I recommend it to my friends and family? Heck ya!",

    "text": "When I lived in the Northeast, I used to travel all the way to Montreal to find hot pot. Now that the weather is getting chilly in Vegas, I find myself in search of hot pot once more. Chubby Cattle is the newest hot pot restaurant in town. It's funny that it advertises itself as \"Chinese fondue\" and the interior decor is a little bit ridiculous, but whatever appeals to the masses.   For those who have never tried hot pot, Chubby Cattle is a fun and interactive introduction. You start off by choosing a soup base. If you're sitting at one of the individual stoves, you can pick any broth except the Heaven and Hell, which is reserved to be shared between people on one of the larger burners. I stayed clear of the spicy broth and stuck with the House Original. Next, you choose an assortment of meats, vegetables, noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and whatever else you feel like putting in your hot pot. Otherwise, if you're sitting next to the conveyor belt, you pick whatever looks good that passes by.  For ingredients, the meats are high quality. I enjoyed the beef brisket, prime short rib, and lamb. The presentation of the mushrooms, vegetables, and noodles were aesthetically amazing. The mushrooms and vegetable combos look as if they had just been foraged from a farmer's market and come in a wooden basket. The arrangement of the assorted meatballs make it easy to cook by hooking it onto your pot without losing it into the abyss. There's also a sauce bar where you can mix and create your own dipping sauce. My personal preference was the fresh garlic, green onions, and white pepper in the ponzu sauce.   Overall, dinner was fun and delicious. Everyone got a scoop of complimentary coffee ice cream. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and service was excellent. My one gripe about Chubby Cattle would be the cost for the amount of food we got. Everything was fresh and delicious, but we were pretty hungry even after a couple of rounds of meat and vegetable/mushroom baskets. It came out to be around $30 per person, which is on the expensive side considering it's hot pot (traditionally, a cheap homemade meal). Also Little Sheep (the franchise Mongolian hot pot) is all-you-can-eat for cheaper. If you're hungry and you eat a lot, you might want to look elsewhere.",

Once you get seated, you choose your broth and after they bring it to you, you choose what you put into your hot pot. Each plate is color-coded to the price they will charge you.  I chose the \"entry-level hell\" broth which was actually super spicy because of the Szechuan peppercorns that were included.  When I went, I didn't get to try the conveyer belt but the food they brought was really good. We got a seafood platter with scallops, shrimp, baby octopus, squid etc. and plates of brisket/lamb and wagyu beef. We also got a few baskets of veggies. It was fun cooking your own food. For much of the meat, you would just need to stick it in for a few seconds before it got cooked.  Since this place is Mongolian inspired, there were a lot of lamb dishes including some lamb chops and lamb on a skewer.   Don't leave without trying the watermelon juice.",

    "text": "I cannot comment on the quality of the food because we were never seated. My friends and I decided to get a nice meal in China Town last night and thought to check out Chubby Cattle because of its uniqueness, good reviews, and because I love Mongolian food and was dying to try the Mongolian pancake.  My friend arrived around 7:20 p.m. and put his name down for a table of four. The rest of us arrived a few minutes later. They told our friend it would be a 35-40 minute wait, and we were willing to wait for any table that opened (conveyor belt or not). A little before 8:00, I went in to double check the wait time for our table. This is when a series of customer service mistakes started.  First, the greeter pretended to not have our name written down. When I pointed it out, she said, \"oh yeah, we won't be able to seat you until 9:00.\" which would have been about an hour and 40 minutes after our arrival. I asked her why she didn't inform us that the wait had changed because we didn't want to wait that long. She just got rude and combative and said that everyone else had reservations.  When I pointed out that other people who had arrived after us somehow jumped our name in line (my friend's name ended up being second from the bottom, despite people arriving after us) and asked if they had reservations she said no. At this point I was getting pretty upset and I asked why they were ahead of us and she just shrugged it off. Then she rudely handed me a business card and suggested that they were a reservations-only restaurant and that if we ever expected to get a table we should set a reservation.   I was fuming at this point and after she argued with me for a few more minutes, I walked out to prevent myself from getting even more upset. We ended up walking over to Hachi, which is in the same strip mall, and the experience there was soooo much better. At Hachi, they apologized that we had to wait five minutes for a table and gave us menus to look at while keeping us updated about the process.   I would never recommend going to Chubby Cattle based on their service. It seems that other people also have this problem, and I'm guessing it's a management issue that will not change. I understand that they are busy, and we were not upset about having to wait, especially on a Friday night, but we were outside and they had my friend's phone number so they could have easily informed us that our wait time had increased by over an hour. Hot pot restaurants are a dime a dozen here in Vegas, so we will definitely take our hot pot adventures somewhere else.",

    "text": "Great concept,  fresh food, and the presentation was really nice.  We had a private room, with 6 individual pots per table. We chose mushroom, original, seafood and tomato broth. For food, we ordered dumplings, seafood, beef, and vegetables. The center of the table houses a large steamer, which was stocked with raw rice. The steaming food cooked and infused flavor into the rice, giving it it a unique flavor and texture. The meats were presented on special trays. Veggies came on carved wooden bowls. Noodles were served uncooked, and were dipped into the broths.   Tomato broth is the best. I didn't care for the seafood broth.  My only complaint is that the table would be better served with 4 or 5 pots, rather than 6, to accommodate the trays of food and baskets of veggies.h",

The broths provide a nice base that you can adjust to your liking using the expansive bar of sauces and seasonings. I tried both the original and the mushroom broths (very tasty).  Then, you choose from a wide variety of meat and seafood to add to your pot, and everything gets cooked in the delicious broth you have concocted.  There is also a conveyor belt of veggies and add-ins like fried tofu skins, bok choy, lotus root, and so much more I couldn't even identify. You can pull anything off the conveyor belt that looks interesting and add to your broth, and your waiter tallies up everything you added at the end.  Kwan was an excellent server, and was always on hand to answer questions. My friend and I experimented with our pots and chatted for about 2 hours here and never felt rushed.  Highly recommended for a unique and delicious experience!",

The seats were squished together and my neighbor and I kept bumping each other which made it hard to be comfortable while eating.   I love spicy food so I chose to go with the medium spicy soup base. Their medium was more like a 10/10 on a spicy scale. I was unable to enjoy anything because it was so spicy. The more the soup kept boiling, the spicier and more inedible everything became. I spent most of my time drinking water, and that's if the waiter even came around to fill my cup without me asking.   I wanted to give it another try, so the second time around I asked for a table away from the conveyor belt and was planning to order a non-spicy soup base. I didn't make a reservation but the lady at the desk said it would take about 30 minutes. 30 minutes went by and the lady offered a conveyor belt seat. I explained that I'm willing to wait for a table because of the terrible experience I had last time. She said ok and said it should be a few minutes since they still had to clean a table that was just cleared. 15 minutes go by and the host says our table is ready. The waitress leads us to our \"table\" and to our luck she seats us by the conveyor belt. I tell the waitress that we specifically asked for a table and were waiting for a seat away from the conveyor belt because of our last experience, but she said that they can't seat us at a table because there was only 2 of us.   After all that waiting they thought that we'd cave in and just settle for what we didn't want. No thanks! We simply walked out and had dinner elsewhere. Never coming back.",

Let me tell you this,  it was well worth the wait because the soup was very flavorful.   This is a great place for hot pot.  I ordered the tomato an ox tail soup. It is a excellent choice and I pretty much finished a whole entire pot.  Everyone gets their own individual hot pot .  We ordered three combos of meat and that was shared among five people.   This is a very fun place to eat because it has the same concept as revolving sushi except it's hot pot items.  Our server was named Deni.  He was super nice and very excellent and his explanation of the menu.  They have multiple TVs here and we watched the Warriors game seven of the NBA finals.  I would definitely recommend this place as it is a very fun place to eat.",

The wagyu brisket and beef combo is packed full of meat that goes really well with the six different soups that they provide for hot pot. They also have a really cool conveyor belt system that brings food for hot pot to you. They have happy hour for the conveyor belt where you can buy one dish and get the other for free! Note that happy hour is only on Mondays through Thursdays from 9:30 to 11:30.  Our server Brandon was actually so nice and took care of everything we needed. He heard our calls from miles away and all the food was brought out promptly. He also knows the menu really well and gave us an in depth explanation of the restaurant and the food that we could order.   The aesthetic of the place is great. The music is lively and it is well lit.  Overall. Really great restaurant with really awesome food and servers. Definitely satisfied.",

I've been by a couple of times now, most recently for their reopening with their expanded menu featuring more meats. Not that they needed any, but it's definitely a place to take your favorite carnivore. Note that they also have extensive seafood and veggie options, too.  PICK YOUR BROTH: The tomato is a go-to, but if you like spice opt for the medium, which completely cleared out my sinuses. They are not kidding. I wouldn't go hotter than this. Props for having individual broth bowls as well as half-and-half options. MAKE YOUR SAUCE: The station in the dining room has several sauces, herbs, and add-ins to make a dipping sauce for your meat. I like combining all the garlic and chili options, then topping with cilantro, green onion, and fried garlic. There are mouthwash stations in the bathrooms so your garlic-heavy food won't ruin your post-dinner date night plans. EAT YOUR MEAT (and veggies): The bounty of hot pot add ins here is insane, from baskets of veggies and platters of protein, all photogenically presented for your  pleasure. The combo plates are your best bet, allowing you to mix and match. Check for specials, like Dorper sheep and crawfish. Some of my favorites have been the wagyu, brisket, quail eggs, and shrimp paste. Don't forget the enoki!  Reasonable prices and attentive service are just bonuses here. If you're coming in solo or as a couple, sit by the conveyor belt. Consider a late-night visit for their half price happy hour. Families and groups can request a private room for celebrations.  Hot pot isn't something I have often but Chubby Cattle has definitely raised the bar for my expectations when I do.",

Fortunately spared the forty-minute waits and close set tables, the later not particularly a turn-off as the action behind glass at both ends of the room may be as entertaining to some as the persons with whom they are sharing a meal, it was just past 7pm during the height of the rush that a server explained Chubby Cattle's concept before presenting four different Soups & turning the electric burners up to three, the aromatics soon perfuming the air with bubbling to commence just a few minutes afterward  Allowing the staff to make selections at will, one member of the table abstaining from Pork & Shellfish consistently pleased from beginning to end with her Tomato-based Broth & items including an impressive variety of leafy Greens and Mushrooms including King Oyster slices & pillowy Wood Ears that became soft and thoroughly saturated after just a quick bath in the Soup, other Soup bases ranging $5-6 included Mixed Mushroom & the traditional Pork based version as well as the \"Hellishly Hot\" one with dried Chili Peppers, a similar base used in the daily special Crawfish Broil with Corn, Shrimp & Mussels all intermingling with fresh Crustaceans just flown in from New Orleans the prior evening.  Making two trips to an AYCE Toppings and Salad Bar as the table waited briefly for ingredients to arrive, both the Seaweed and Cucumber Salad very good with the former lightly spiced & the later pickled and refreshing when transitioning between various ingredients, other choices such as Korean Hot Sauce, Soy, Garlic & even Sugar were available for those looking to augment flavors completely to their liking, a bit of steamy Hellishly Hot with a tablespoon of Peanut Butter proving a great way to enjoy Tofu, whether fleshly sliced or fried  Pairing the meal with Wine, the Red going over well with most while the Riesling with a bit of residual sugar stood up well to both the Hot and Traditional broths, it was not long before a plate of Beef arrived featuring Brisket, Ribeye and Japanese Wagyu, a bit of resistance needed to resist simply eating the latter as it was, the first attempt to not overcook the thin slices a notable failure with the heat subsequently turned down to 1, a 30s dip yielding just the right amount of cooking to maximize both texture & flavor  Next offered a platter of chilled Seafood, the communal table adjacent going all-out with live Shrimp and Lobster but missing out on the fresh Scallops & Clams that took a while to yield themselves to low heat, it was only the skimpy Crab that proved the slightest bit disappointing, the previously frozen meat a bit mushy in its texture while the Tiger Shrimp, when properly cooked, were snappy & delicious complete with head & tail  Told that the hand-cut Sheep was something special, a simple glance at the brick-red muscle and rim of fat indicating a quality breed with a backstory that includes cross-breeding & genetics that were specifically sought out by the owners of Chubby Cattle, it was with pots set at two that raw flesh turned into juicy morsels with an up-front funk but clean finish, the hand cranked noodles available in 3 varieties rounding things out and great not only as filler, but also based on fact that they cook up well in just minutes while still maintaining a bit of tooth even if they spend a more lengthy amount of time in the broth.",

They offer a variety of soup bases; and if you choose the house hellishly spicy pot, you can customize the spice level. I started with the entry level hell 6 and it was pretty spicy.  They also have a build you own sauce bar, which is awesome. The concept of the restaurant is the conveyor belt food delivery system, where you grab what you want from the belt. We didn't get to sit at a table with the conveyor belts because there was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have reservations. We sat at a regular table and ordered off the menu, which had the same if not more than what was on the belt, so we didn't feel like we missed out by not getting the conveyor belt experience. The variety of meats, seafood and vegetables as well as the service was great. I wish they had Chubby Cattle in Houston because I'd go all the time.",

They have a wide variety of condiments from soy sauce, minced garlic, teriyaki sauce to spicy special chef sauce.  You have to pick your meat, veggies and noodles.    We also ordered a Large Kolbe Rice Beef that was so tasty deeelish, every bite was filled with Kolbe beef. Highly recommended.",

There's a good variety of foods that will suit everyone's taste.",

The dinning environment and service quality are definitely better than most of the Chinese restaurants but I'm not really came here for that. Now I feel the Red Pot is the best hot pot in Las Vegas now. Don't think will come back here again.",

The experience was unique and the server was attentive, however; the process wasn't explained well to us and we were left scratching our heads and had to \"figure\" out what to do with the food and guess at what we were taking on the conveyor belt. It was an interesting experience, but one time is all we needed.  We likely won't go back :(",

The interior is modern with an Asian twist. They offer a conveyor belt that supplied side dishes that you can add to your pot, as well as an additional menu filled with meats and seafood. Our server was Deni, he was very attentive and helpful being it our first time. He went over the menu and was friendly at all times. I would highly recommend this new place to any foodies out there! :)",

    "text": "Sorry Chubby Cattle I am not a fan  I really wanted to love you and have you become one of my go to spots. I wanted to share you with my friends and family and sadly this will not be happening.   Coming from Boston where I feel our shabu shabu is the .com I was really hoping this could be the spot .. Wahh   Ok on to my review   It was a Friday night around 10pm. I know late night dinner. I was feeling great. I just got out of a massage ( super popular here) Time for some yummy hot pot.  I had book mark this place and love the concept of the restaurant with the conveyer belt as there is nothing like it in Vegas.   We got seated pretty quickly. I was excited as we got seated at the conveyer belt. It was fogged up and you couldn't really see inside but you could open the lid and check out the selection. The plate color indicated the pricing.  The waiter we had kept trying to tell us you are new here so get like everything combo. The combo veggie and mushroom came in these wooden like basket. The combo beef plate were huge not ideal for a small tables. He seem to discourage us from the items in the conveyer belt. Why ??  We ended up getting the mushroom combo, watercress and meat combo. They did not have a liquor license so BYOB. I tried their watermelon juice ( this seemed water down ) everything else seem fine and fresh.  BF got the tomato base soup and I got the mid level spicy broth. The broth were nothing to blow you out the water .   Now here is where it turns  So when we were waiting on our items we headed over to the sauce station no bowls so we sat back down since none of the staff standing around acknowledge us looking around for bowls and say oh do you need anything( we figure oh maybe they bring you the bowl)  The waiter goes oh go grab your sauce guys. We head over along with all the other newbies and crowded around the station. No bowls Wth ! I look at this guy and said where are the bowls and he comes back with tea cups  ok so I take it. We sit back in out seat ready to go no bowls for our soup ( is this not a hot pot soup spot ? ) or soup spoons . I ask for these items 5 times from 5 different people. Finally I gave up on the bowls just give me soup spoons . This guy says oh let me go wash you some ( why did he feel the need to tell me this ) I wanted to say do you want a cookie !!!  In the middle of eating in our tight cramp area with all our items the waiter comes and ask would you like to do a survey for special on your birthday !! I was like seriously right now I'm not even done eating. My answer was NO.  Than the waiter comes back and interrupts us Again about they are sending him home early and if he could get us our check. Of course we were done and over this place so we said that was fine.  He than comes back to tell us he is giving us free ice cream and to show some support on Yelp. At this point I was at boiling point ! What turn to be a nice night ! They killed my vibe",

    "text": "I liked it the first time I came, but the second time (last night) not so much. My bf and I ordered the spicy broth and mine was pure grease. You know when you put oil in water? Yea, it looked just like that. It tasted just like it too. It was terrible. When trying to tell the server I didn't like it she just kept insisting it I was too spicy for me. Maybe a language barrier? She even scooped the peppers out even though I kept saying \"it's just too greasy.\" I really think she just didn't want to get me a different soup because once I made it clear I wouldn't eat it and wanted a different broth she seemed bothered. After that she didn't really come to our table nor seem too happy when she did. But back to the food, the original broth I got instead was really great with seafood sauce and cilantro. It tasted VERY similar to Pho (my fave) but when the bill came it was nearly $20 per person. I could've bought actual Pho for 1/2 the price. Overall I just didn't find the food or service to be worth a $20 meal.",
