I came in with my husband and 2 daughters.  The waitress greeted us the minute we stepped in the door and luckily she was our waitress for the night.  She was formal (like they are in fancy restaurants)  but not one bit stuffy.  She helped us with ordering (the kebobs are to die for! as is the sampler plate!)  The presentation was along the lines of a 4 star restaurant.  She brought us complimentary Turkish tea at the conclusion of our meal which was wonderful!  We will definitely go back again.  I also think this would make a great event restaurant as they offer platters for 8 or more people.  Prices are very reasonable for what you get!",

Never crowded and each waitress has been extremely nice and attentive. The pita bread app comes out warm and tasty and the hummus is so good. We have been to several Mediterranean restaurants in town and Maza makes the best chicken kabobs, marinated so tasty and juicy and cooked just right. Had the chicken wrap (sandwich) once and that was really good too. They have groupon and coupons in the flyers for 1/2 off an entree or $5 off or free Baklava dessert and they always take both the $5 and give the free baklava too, bonus!  Plus they give you free Turkish hot tea at end too which is tasty. No complaints except they stop taking <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates for some reason and I still had one (never expire). They were nice and apologetic about it but still was a disappointment.

Tasted like canned Cambell's soup with maybe puree'd lentles ... not sure it was pretty bland. No flavor. Wife's Greek salad was just ... meh, okay. Nothing remarkable, can get this anywhere. I had a Gyro sandwich which was cold, not warm. Cold. I believe it should have been warm. It was served with 3 canned pickles on a plate with a small plastic container with an ounce of thousand island salad dressing. Maybe for the limp fries. Greek? I don't think so. The reviews all show decent. Umm ... not even close. Maybe the business does this to generate interest. The owner was there I think. He was courteous to all the middle eastern patrons but us white people he avoided even a welcome. All I know is what tastes good. In a competitive market, quality and at least feeling appreciated as a customer goes a long way. Yes, there are lot's of great choices in Las Vegas so sadly, avoid this place. There are much, much, much, much better restaurants for equal or cheaper prices. We've been to Paymon's up on Sahara at Durango, it was by far better with great customer service.",

I also asked for the vegetable kebab. 15 minutes passes and the served comes up and says, \"Sorry, we don't have eggplant for the vegetable kabob, do you want it ?\" We said No since there is no point of ordering a vegetable kabob with no eggplant. So we waited and approximately 25-30 minutes later the server brings us a Chicken kabob plate for my wife. My wife did not start eating and just waited for my plate. Approximately 35 minutes later I ask the served how much longer do I have to wait for my beef kabob. The server says\" its $9.95 and about 10 minutes.\" I told him that I don't care about the price and just wanted to know how long do I have to wait for my plate and he replied, \"you didn't order anything.\" I told him that the first thing came out of my mouth was a beef kabob and he had that stupid look on his face. The server was from Serbia and his english was not good to understand I guess what we ordered. Let me tell you how the dirty that place was all kind of dust on the floor and chairs. The service was horrible, I asked for napkins and refill for my soda. My wife and I ended up splitting the chicken and it tasted bad, besides the portion was very small. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands prior to ordering and it smelled really bad. Try other places in town and don't waste your money please. I promise you will be disappointedworst restaurant in town.",

    "text": "Wow, we ate here last night for the first time last night and we are STILL talking about it! The food was perfect in every way and the prices are very reasonable.  We ordered: Cheese plate appetizer - sliced moist Bulgarian feta with piles of fresh herbs like                                          Basil, dill, mint, and also some green onions Sampler Appetizer - hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, and dolmas Chicken kebab Veggie kebab Combo kebab Beef shwarma  The appetizers were delicious. I was especially impressed with the giant piles of fresh herbs served with the yummy Bulgarian feta on the cheese plate.  American feta is more on the dry and crumbly side, so we appreciate restaurants that serve the moist and creamy Bulgarian type. This place got my honey to try mint and dill leaves for the first time too, and he enjoyed it! Score! The sampler appetizer was  fantastic. We enjoyed the hummus and dolmas, and I was hooked on the tabbouleh salad. Baba ganoush was yummy too.  On to the main course....  We each ordered kebabs. Every thing we ordered was seasoned perfectly and was served beautifully on the plates. All of the meat and veggies were grilled with skill as they were so moist. The grilled veggies had the perfect amount of charring on them. All dinners come with some grilled veggies (tomato, onions, and jalapeno), jasmine rice or fries, and a salad. We each had salad and rice. Salad was delicious and had a unique dressing. It was light with good flavor and we enjoyed it. The jasmine rice was amazing. I  usually forego the carby side dishes, but I couldn't keep my fork out of this rice....super yum!!!  It's worth noting this places does not have a liquor license. However, don't let that be a deal breaker for you, as you can BYOB. We will be doing that for beer and wine next time. There is also a convenience store in the same parking lot you can run into to in case you forget.    We ordered so much food my only regret was not saving room for dessert. I'm not really worried....as we can wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "This place is about the only place that makes their babaganoush on the chunky side. At most places it comes out looking just like hummus...and it's not very good. Theirs could be better but it's still good as were the rest of the items on the Maza sampler (+hummus, tabouleh, & sarma).   We also ended up with the Seafood Kabob (we tried to cancel this & swap for the Maza sampler but the waitress cancelled our other order). Which was just as well because it was surprisingly good. The shrimp was well cooked and seasoned and tasted great with this (I think) tomato based sauce). The salmon, which I'm sure was Altantic farmed, actually tasted pretty salmony which is hardly ever the case with farmed raised salmon because it's awful.   I don't recommend the Turkish coffee. Despite waiting for the grinds to settle some fine pieces remained suspended so it always tasted a little gritty and wasn't very strong.   I looks like they've got a stage and some sweet light action so I'm not sure if this place blows up at night. We went for lunch at 11:30 on a Saturday and we were the only people in there until another couple eventually came along.",

We were then greeted by a very nice and polite waitress who was very patient with us while we asked her a zillion questions about the menu.. Food came out pretty fast and OMG so tasty... I would definitely recommend this restaurant.. The portions are very fair for the price.. And the owner was very attentive of all the tables.. He made sure we were comfortable, got our food fast, was super friendly and even walked us out after we were done.. But the best part was their bakhlava.. (Request them to warm it up instead of having it cold.. It will add to the taste).. This was by far the best bakhlava I've ever had.. The owner said that his sister makes them fresh which is why they taste good and pretty much homemade..",

It was empty and there was no one in the entry. We waited and waited. Finally, a young lady came out and offered to help us. When I told her I needed a table for two, she told me to sit wherever I wanted. If that's the case, then why don't you just have a sign that says \"Please seat yourself\"?  Instead I had just been standing in the entry like a fool.  My lunch companion arrived shortly thereafter. We haven't seen each other in years so we spent some time catching up.  The server did come by a couple of times, but we were never ready. Then she disappeared. It wasn't busy but she was the only person I saw working. Also, because she let people seat themselves, the few tables were in different corners, which didn't make a lot of sense. Finally we flagged her down. We both ordered salads, which took way too long to come out. I had the Mediterranean salad with chicken and my friend had the Greek salad with salmon. The salad was tasty, but nothing amazing. It did have a lot of dill in it. Once again it was time to wait for the server to pick up our plates and give us our check. Took quite a while once again. All in all, I was there about 2 hours for a salad.  I probably won't go back. I don't live anywhere near this place and there was nothing really compelling to get me to go back.",

All the cucumbers and tomato goodness is now on a bed of boring shredded cabbage, unlike other photos on a bed of greens. So that's a bit disappointing.

It was 4-course meal with bottled water, (plus dates to break fast!), and it was a phenomenal deal at $15/pp. The food was served pretty quickly, and the bread is always piping hot, and makes a perfect accompaniment with their lentil soup.   We make a point to visit this restaurant regularly for tasty kebab and other Turkish specialties. Don't miss out on the kunefe for dessert!",

I usually don't like shrimp but this place really perfected seasoning and preparing of shrimp. If you get anything get the seafood kebab. This kebab came with a salad which I thought was a bit bland but if you're on a salt cleanse it's great.  Also I'm a hummus lover and this place has some gooooooood hummus. Their baklava is great, a tad bit on the oily side though.",

However on our most recent order we were given our total. When the delivery driver arrives we are given a different total. The higher total is due to an additional delivery charge because the driver said \"we are far\"   You were given the address on the phone. At that point if you feel we are too far (although it's never been in previous orders) then say that on the phone. You don't just take on additional funds without ever disclosing it.  If we aren't in your normal delivery area then why did you bring your menus to our office complex to begin with. Disclose this on your menu so consumers are aware. Verbally say it in the phone when taking our orders...  Our company will just take our daily business elsewhere..",

We ordered an assortment of things from the menu including the lebni which is sort of like a yogurt/cream cheese type flavor with olive oil and spices. I was so happy to see they offered it since it's one of my favorite things to have with pita (or anything else really) but it isn't something you can get everywhere. It was a hit, as was the juicy chicken kebab and the shwarma wrap that was on special. Entree sizes are great for the price (under or around $10). Even the greek salad was big enough to have leftovers. The employees seemed Persian so that added to the authenticity of the food for sure. They also offered us tea at the end of the meal which was a nice treat.   Maza would be a great place to have a large group dinner where you reserve the entire dining room.",

I chose the chopped salad with cucumber and tomato and pickle cabbage, rather than the french fries or the rice- and I'm so happy I did. Everything  was out of this world.

The chicken (& lots of it) was pure melt-in-your-mouth, with just the right herbs.  My partner had the beef Shawarma sandwich which he raved about & which incl. a real variety of goodies, accompanied by a huge plate of non-greasy French fries.  The order of Baba Ghanoush was the best I've had in this town & smoky as it should be.  Maza is a Turkish restaurant & playing THEIR music!  What a change & how terrific the sounds.  Our server, Leila, was most charming & efficient.  We are now making this our weekly stop & I can't wait to try the lentil soup, Baklava, & lots of specialties-- all for a song.

Others in my party ordered the chicken kebob lunch specials and a gyro and they looked fantastic.   The lentil soup is different than what I'm used to (more blended consistency) but flavor was great. Both times the salads were lovely - fresh and flavorful. The herb balance with the Mediterranean salad was a standout. Chicken was tender and had good spice blends on it. I think probably the worst thing was the pita. Both times it was thin and dry, maybe over-warmed? Hummus didn't have as strong of a flavor as I'm used to, but maybe I'm just used to over-salted store bought stuff.   Service was great both times. Wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable about most items on the menu. It's not THE best Mediterranean I've had, but it's certainly the best within a mile or two from my work. I'll be back. The quality and experience is worth the (reasonable) price.",

The chicken was moist and the lamb tasty though more overdone than we generally prefer.",

As other reviews stated the dining room is very pleasant so next time (soon) we will eat in the restaurant.  We had Chicken Kabobs, both chix breast and an order of ground.  The hummus was very fresh.  Salad crisp and everything was healthy.   Definite good find!",

The appetizer was 4 pieces of flavorful but dense felafel. It was more dense than dry but it was hot at least. Combo kebab platter and chicken kebab were good. The meat was seriously tender. I did not say it was seasoned but it was nicely tender. Rice was good. Tomatoes were undergrilled. There was no grilled onion on the plate. I was sort of lost as the onion should be my companion in every MidEastern meal. We chose to try bakhlava. They serve two pieces on the plate. It was dry and without sufficient honey. Definitely cheaply prepared. My husband's father made home made delicious bakhlava and the version at Maza should not be the reason for your trip over here by any means. The meal was a solid 3. Not bad but not overwhelming. Maybe with a serious chef and reasonable expenditure to primp up that dessert and spring for my stinking onion it could really rock.",

This was the first time I ate this dish, so I didn't know what it was supposed to taste like. I didn't really taste the eggplant but I could taste the garlic and olive oil. I probably won't get this again when I return.  Then came the mediterranean salad. It was the best thing I ate. All of the vegetables were so crisp and fresh, they all had good flavor and the herbs helped brighten all of the flavors of the vegetables further.  The kabob combo was good as well. All of the meat was grilled perfectly and it was all moist. I couldn't really taste the seasoning on any of of the meat. The tatziki sauce and red tomatoe based sauce that came with everything helped add constrasting flavor. The fries were seasoned well, hot, and crisp. The pita bread that came with everything I ordered was soft and warm, with good flavor on it's own. I also got a couple of pieces of baklava for checking into Yelp.  Service was excellent, my drink never went empty, my orders came out correct, and I was given plenty of extra napkins.  The food and service was so good, I ordered another groupon to come again. I'll keep coming as long as they have a groupon, and I would come even without a groupon.",

In fact the ground chicken kebab was probably the best I've had. I also really liked the hummus and the tomato cucumber salad. They could however ease up on the herbs in this salad but it's pretty good.   The atmosphere is a bit more upscale than you would normally expect for a kebab joint but the cost doesn't really reflect it that much. The service is better than most places I've been with similar food. I really like to support our local businesses in Las Vegas as we are also business owners. I really look forward to going back here for dinner when they add the entertainment and get their liquor license. Food good service good price point is affordable. I think this place will make it and it will be a good spot to spend the evenings. I highly reccomend!",

How this happened?  2 years ago, I came to Vegas for the first time and I was looking a Mediterranean restaurant. I found this restaurant on yelp. It was newly opened but the taste and quality of food was so delicious, so i had all my meals in MAZA during my vacation in Vegas. Also, the owner was so helpful and intimate that he gave information about Vegas, clubs and casinos. He even suggested some other restaurants from other cuisines. After this great taste experience, I came to Vegas 2 more times and on each of my trips, I went to MAZA to have my lunches and dinners. I also took my friends to MAZA, they were amazed by the great taste and hospitality. We were like in our home and had great time in MAZA. On the other hand, the employees are awesome! Jessica, the manager, she was very helpful and hosted perfectly when the Owner, Kamil was not in the restaurant. The cooker, Ege, he is an amazing young guy with great cooking talents. He cooked the kebab exactly as i wanted. The waitress, Lila and Serbian guy, they were smiling intimately, not insincerely. Ibo, the service guy, he even came to talk to us. And Kamil, the owner, he is an awesome, friendly, chatty guy.. I really enjoyed my conversations with him. In my last trip, I saw that they developed their business and they have new dishes in their new menu which the photos of each dishes. Also, the owner brought a another cooker from Turkey and started to serve pide and lahmacun which are my favorite fast food in Turkey and they go further and now they order a stone oven to cook pide and lahmacun.  Lastly, they use Halal meat which is important for me since I care my diet and health so much. Basically, MAZA Restaurant is a perfect place to have Turkish Mediterranean food. When you go there you have not only great food but also perfect friends. I strongly recommend you to go there. I wish they were here in Monterey, CA. Maybe, one day, they will.. ;)",

    "text": "Hey guys, a little disappointed on a couple of things and ok with others.   Ordered the chicken shawarma and beef wrap. Both were good. The fries that came with both were cold though (note I ordered from UrberEats, therefore I'd expect them to be cold I guess - even though my house is 6mins from you). Well done on both items not being soggy though.   But wtf is up with the rice pudding? Having had rice pudding from many other Turkish restaurants over the years from all over the world I sort of had the expectation that they are all the same i.e. good. Thing is too, rice pudding ain't too damn hard to get wrong. But look at the picture of what I received... I thought it was melted cheese or something? Then as I realized it was a burnt rice pudding?!? Why is it even burnt? Oh and no cinnamon.   Look I feel silly - which I shouldn't be - complaining about $3.95... but this ain't right you guys. Take it off the menu and don't have this crap available! What's really dodgy here is that I rang you guys too, straight away upon receiving my order to ask what was up and the lady's response was \"well they know what they're doing\". Well guess what, not with this particular item at this particular time. I mean seriously, look at the picture again and tell me they got this one right. What a waste of time, effort, a few dollars and energy you lot.",

We ordered food and another guy from the management assured us that we will get our food no later by 7:00 pm. We sat and waited . Around 7:20 I asked the main waiter abt how much more time we need to wait . Very rudely he answered that he is just a waiter and can't take the responsibility of chef being slow . At 7:30 he brought chicken shish kabab , threw it on our table and left . We still had chicken shawarma to come . I asked him that we ordered pita bread to be eaten with shish kabab . He just ignored. I asked him again , a bit louder this time and he shouted that he heard me first time and I didn't need to repeat . My husband asked him to atleast acknowledge that he had heard what we asked for . He came to our table , took shish kabab and said bye bye  \" u can leave \" . I have never seen such terrible behavior from any server . I understand that they were overworked , stressed as it seems they had taken order greater than their capabilities but such behavior was not justified.  Never going back there and telling everyone I know abt  this as well.",

I don't know. It felt like we were in an abandoned restaurant. Our waiter was friendly but seemed like he was new and didn't know much about the menu. He did refill our water without us asking though so that's always a plus. I ordered my fave, babaganoush as a starter - it was alright. I got seafood plate and the salmon was too dry. My husband didn't enjoy his shawarma, said he's had better. Will I come back? Not too sure.",

They didn't refill my water or check on me at all. It took a while to be able to alert the server that I would like my check. In fact, the only thing they were fast about was picking up the bill once I signed, which is bad form.  As for the food, well, good food can at least partially redeem lackluster service. This was not particularly good food. At $14 for the Doner plate, considering the average quality of the product, it is about $4 overpriced. I have had considerably better versions of the same dish. The cabbage side was ok, but the salad looked unappealing with non-fresh lettuce etc.  So, definitely thumbs down. Way down. Almost one star down. Very disappointed.",

Their menu includes dishes ranging from Turkish breakfast to Iskender Doner Kebab, as well as, Lahmacun to variety of Pides. Their desserts such as Kunefe are spectacular! You will see the photos that I took. They speak for themselves! Plus, the restaurant has a gorgeous Mediterranean-style interior-architecture.

The food is outstanding, very tasty and a great option if you like Turkish or middle eastern food. The quality of the meat and seafood was excellent. Great service as well. I recommend escaping the strip for a quiet dinner here that will satisfy your palate.",

First we started with a 2 maza sampler, fresh warm pita bread with 3 different kinds of dips, so yummy . Then we had the salad that is very fresh, never had that kind before but I can't complain, it was good. After that entree was served ( see photo ) every item we ordered was very tasty especially the beef kabob but truly overall, everything was delicious!!! Lastly to complete the meal, baklava & hot tea compliments the whole deal, our first experience to eat Mediterranean food was phenomenal!!! The only bill i got was just the soda we ordered & of course I gave a generous tip for a wonderful service & excellent meal! We would love to come back here again especially my kids whose normally hard to please when it comes to food but they couldn't wait to come  back here again & try the other items on their menu. Best visit ever!",

Falafel was a touch well done on the outside but very soft on the inside, and not overly salty as it can be. Baklava and Turkish tea was a great conclusion to this very inexpensive yet delicious meal. We will be back!",

The Falafel were just thrown into a box like they had just been scooped from the road outside.  Coffee was fine. Bread was good.  Never coming back to eat here and probably won't be having any Mediterranean food for a while.",

We also had a groupon for the Maza platter/sampler for 4 people, which came with 4 different appetizers- hummus, babaghanoush, tabouli and tzatziki for the pita bread, 4 entrees  as well as 4 pieces of baclava for dessert. The pita bread was very good, even without the sauces, but in the actual meals, the meat was put on top of the pita bread, which made it soggy. The meats were tender and flavorful, and the salmon in particular was very tender and well seasoned, and so was the shrimp. The seafood platter is my favorite. I didn't get to try the lamb dishes but  must be very good as my companions cleaned up their plates.   Our servers are really nice and efficient. Price is very reasonable. Delicious food. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Wow. Probably the tastiest kebab I've ever eaten.  The seafood kebab comes with juicy lump of salmon and flavorful grilled shrimp, as well as the shiny grains of rice and grilled tomato and chili. The tomato-based dipping sauce has intricate but not overpowering flavor that complements the simplicity of grilled stuff.  Tried both lamb and beef, and while both were really good, lamb will remain as our fix. Hummus was great, too.  But I cannot end this review without mentioning the most surprising find: Baklava.  Whenever we tried baklava in the past, it was always too sweet to the point that caused a headache. We never liked it. But as this place offered baklava as a check-in bonus, we decided to try on a whim - and glad we did! The baklava had a delicate sweetness and texture, and the flavor of ground pistachio completed the traditional Turkish pastry. Also, we ordered a couple of chai - comes in the traditional cute little cup - at no charge!  One major letdown was that the both times we visited, the table cloth was not clean, and the paper table cover didn't fit with the shape of the table in a booth, and kept making friction noise all the time. Interior design could use some sprucing up.  When those issues are solved, I can give them five stars!",

THEN!!! We order kunafe and tea that took about 30 minutes itself like if they went picking the tea leaves or something. They come with the stuff meanwhile our dirty dinner dishes are still laid in the table like if it's a normal thing for a waitress not to pick that up before bringing dessert. Mind you the entire time she's back and forth helping other customers. We try the tea it's cold like an iced tea!!! Are you freaking kidding me! Plus they served it to us in 3 different cup sizes. Each one of us had a different one. Last after this horrid experience, the waitress split the check but charged both on the same card like really?? How hard is it for you to figure out 2 different cards?? Mind you we actually wrote it very detailed on the paper to make sure which total to charge to which card. Owner comes to apologize since he saw we were complaining to Tony (their only helpful friendly waiter) as our waitress walks away from the conversation. Very rude and disrespectful. I wouldn't recommend it at all.",

The chicken kabob comes with a big bowl of salad.  He slurped (yes, probably more than you yelpers needed to know!) the salad dressing because it was just that good!

The hummus was the best along with the fresh hot bread that is comes with.  I was a bit hungry as I had a gryo (fantastic) and the seafood kabob.  My partner had the combo kabob that had beef , chicken and lamb.  The meats were very tasty in that you could tell that they were marinated and not just seasoned on the top of the meat.  We had the baklava for dessert and a surprise of turkish tea with it.  The tea was so good in that it required nothing like lemon or sugar in order to drink it.  We will defintley be back.",

I had the Beef doner kabab, and the beef was done perfectly, it came with salad or you can sub with french fries and side of radish. I like the house sauce that came with it. My friend had Manti which is Turkish handmade ravioli served with garlic yougurt sauce and red topping. That was ok, the ravioli could be done a little more.  My favorite is Karniyarik which is oven roasted eggplant stuffed with ground beef and special herbs, served with tzatziki and rice pilaf.  For desert, Kunefe was excellent, it's made with cheese pastry soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup, topped with pistachios.  The atmosphere is a bit more upscale and I love the lanterns and aquariums.   The young waitress was very attentive.  The price were affordable. I would like to return. I highly recommend!",

We won't be going back there obviously, also the interior is really old and the blinds are bend from the sun , overall this place needs an overhaul. When we left the waitress didn't even say thanks, she had a little bit of an attitude. Maybe she was just overworked, but that's not really my problem.",

    "text": "Maza is a casual Turkish Mediterranean place with indoor seating. Our overall experience was an extremely long wait, 45 minutes, with mediocre food lacking flavor. The unfiltered city water had more flavor than the food - even though the water should not have flavor! Time to change that water filter.  The ambience is loud even though it was not very busy. The restrooms were clean and open.  Appetizer: Warm Pita Bread and Hummus was very good.  Main Dish  Beef Doner Kebab - mediocre and very lacking of flavor. The rce was fantastic. Salad was filled with mostly hard stems and very little lettuce leaves.  Kofte Kebab - We found out 15 minutes after ordering that they ran out.  Switched to Chicken Shawarma - very disappointing and lacking of flavor.  After the long wait, we skipped any additional drinks and desserts.  Service was friendly, but the lack of hostess and seat yourself only added to the confusion - we had trouble finding a clean table and then waited 10 minutes before we were greeted at the table.   At our departure, our server apologized for the poor service, long wait, and bad food experience, but made no efforts to fix the issue. It is surprising that this restaurant has such high ratings.",

It looks a little rough around the edges (they were repainting the exterior when I went) but the inside dining room is gorgeous! They have three salt water fish tanks (easy entertainment for children) and an area where live music plays on some nights.   I wish I knew the name of the gal that was serving us but the food has taken over my brain. She was awesome! Very attentive to our needs and always made sure we had our glasses filled.  The food was ON POINT. I would describe each item we had but that means this review would be forever long and I'd be repeating myself because everything was PERFECT. The pide was flawlessly soft and the doner was flat out delicious. We had heaping handfuls of leftovers due to their generous portions and our server was so kind to label what each of the boxes contained, so we easily knew how to distribute at the end of the evening.  I don't regret anything I ate, but I'm pretty sure I had a food hangover the next day, so be sure to head over here when you're hungry!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since we pass it often to and from work.   While it is labeled as a Mediterranean fare, it seems to be Turkish.  Babaganoush was pretty decent. It was rather creamy so if you like a creamier dip then this might be for you.   Entree meals came with a salad and that came out first in its own bowl. The serving was generous and I like the simple lemon and fresh herbs that make the vinaigrette.   Chicken adana kabob had good flavor and texture. Beef kofta kebob could have been cooked less as it was slightly dry though. There was a side of a ezme sauce which is a tomato pepper salsa of sorts, grilled pepper and tomato, onion slices and a few triangles of pita bread. You get a choice of rice or fries and we got one of each which were both good. Everything was simple fare, but solid.   The baklava was really good. Real buttery, nice syrup and light on spices and served warm. Currently theres a yelp check in for a free square.   Service was friendly. At first we sat around for a long while as the server got tied up on the phone, but after we were checked on in a timely manner. Then a new server started helping and she was super personable as well.    I will be back. It was really reasonably priced, fresh tasting and good portions.",

The hummus serving is very generous and I always ask for extra pita to stretch it out.  Today when I ordered they had a new type of pita that was fluffier than normal pita and very tasty.  Their kabobs are very good, I often order sarma, which is well spiced and the entrees come with a nice sized salad.  The only inconsistent thing I've had was the rice pudding.  A couple of times it was mediocre, however today it was deliciously sweet.  I'll keep ordering from this restaurant.",

We had the Maza sampler  and for our entrees, we both had the combo Kabob. We should have braced ourselves, I know but the babaganoush, hummus, tabbouleh and sarma were so good we could not stop eating. Add to that the warm pita slices. By the time our entrees came, we were pretty full. The lamb, beef and chicken pieces were so moist, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The last time we were here, the chicken was a little dry, this time everything was cooked perfectIy.  Personally, I still prefer the lamb and beef. It even seems like they gave us more meat or the pieces got bigger. Even the salad was huge. Not complaining though :) . Of course the meal came with baklava for dessert(which we asked to go) and Turkish tea.  We will definitely be back.",

We are so glad we stopped by, the chicken skewers were the moist chicken I've ever tasted. The portions are huge and an entree comes with a big bowl of salad. All under $10!  What a deal.  I couldn't believe how great the food tasted and how fresh all the dishes were, it was a great find!  We also had a last minute post - wedding brunch at Maza last Sunday. We called an hour in advance and asked for 2 tables for 30 people!  An hour in advance!! They were able to accommodate us, no problem!  We order a few shared platters and shared family style.  All the dishes were prepared and presented beautifully. Our server was polite and on top of things. Everyone thought the food was amazing. These people come from all over the U.S, Boston, NY, SF, LA - great foodie areas and all said the food was exceptional.    Often times with brunch with a big group, you have to wait either a long time to get a table, reserve months in advance and pay a deposit.  Maza made it so easy to organize a last minute wedding event that didn't cost us and arm and a leg.    Any big group dinners I plan again we will definitely be back at Maza.  I can't wait to visit again!",

    "text": "We are always looking for a great mediterranean restaurant, we have tried a couple on this side of town and have been disappointed dry overdone and poor wait service.    I was a bit surprised when we walked in and it was pretty bare, but it was a sunday night.  We were seated by a very friendly nice young lady, we later found out was from the Ukraine so some of the food is worded differently and has some difference.  For instance we ordered Sarma is very similar to Dolmades I could tell the difference in texture, Sarma seamed softer more creamy texture, I liked it a lot better then Dolmades!  The next app was Baba Ghanoush it is a cooked eggplant dish similar to a Hummus or a baked artichoke dip without the high fat in artichoke dip.  I loved it creamy soft with lots of flavors and low in fat with a warm soft fresh pita, Soso GOODgood.  The dinner was as good, we opted for the signature burger Maza Burger, I know strange choice but they made it sound so good in the menu and we were not super hungry it just looked good and it was.  It is not the normal burger I think it may have had lamb in it, it was soft and bold in flavor but the softer flavors blended everything together and the spicy sauce made it a great burger.  It also had lettuce, tomato, a pickled something or other it wasn't a pickle but it kind of was a pickle.  I wish I would have asked I will next time I kind of love pickles!   My next visit I am going to get the lamb, i was just not hungry enough this time.  The service was A+ she came back a few times even though it did start to fill up as we ate.  I like how she was proud of her heritage and knowledge of food from her reign to explain small details is great detail.  I was very happy and will be going back, it is close to home and easy to pick up, now if they only had delivery...",

The lunch special is $9.99 and comes with a starter and a dessert . As a starter we both ordered the salad - the veggies were delicious and crispy , the only thing we could say was we wish the dressing had more flavor .. It seemed to be just oil and was missing the vinegar and tartness that is common in Mediterranean salads . Our chicken plates were delicious ! We also upgraded to fries and they were very tasty ! For dessert we ordered the rice pudding & baklava - both came with a delicious Turkish tea to finish it all ... Very delicious deal .   Note : lunch specials end at 3pm !",

    "text": "Last week we visited Las Vegas with my husband! The last day we wanted to eat Turkish as me and my husband have a lot of passion about our home cooking! Unfortunately I was really disappointed! My husband ate Iskender kebab which tasted completely like tomato paste and I tried doner wrap which tasted nothing! Sorry I don't want to be harsh but as a Turkish the taste of the food that we tried was unacceptable! I ordered a lentil soup but it was completely tasted like tomato soup again! Why because in Turkish cuisine we use tomato paste as our acidity to taste the food! But in this situation the tomato taste had overwhelmed the real taste!   About service; There were 2 waitress and they extremely forgetful! My husband wanted to order extra lavash bread instead pita! (Turks don't have pita bread! It tasteless and so thick) He said they could charge it to the bill! Guess what  the first waitress told us by bringing another pita in the bread basket , \" sorry this is the only bread we have\" ! She didn't even stop by to explain why! My husband got really upset because we know we just order doner wrap in a lavash bread and they should have more! It's like saying there is no hamburger buns at a hamburger place! We called another waitress! My husband told her we want lavash not pita! Then she had an attitude! We heard she was yelling in the kitchen to the another guy \"what can I do they are Turkish and want lavash\"  she brought lavash after that but we already were full! The only taste that we like was the maza platter! I would not spend any money here as it doesn't have a real Turkish taste in their foods! I hope they change the chef soon as I don't think it's a Turkish chef!",

Just a little bit below the chicken Kebab for consistency.   Service is always great, every portion of my meals has always been fresh. $10-16 for any of the Kebab's is money well spent.

As examples, their french fries, which used to be delicious, are now thin and overly salted, their chicken is not as tender, their feta has a stronger taste, and their Mediterranean salad is not the same. It's almost as if the ratio of their ingredients changed and they no longer cut the tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs into as small of pieces as before.    Hands-down, we used to absolutely crave and rave about this food. Now, I don't even really want to go. We used to go here once a week, and I probably haven't been there more than three times in the past six months. I don't know what's going on but lots has changed.

I loved the character and charm this band added to the experience.  This place doesn't serve alcohol. Which was unexpected but totally cool. The service was a little spotty, because it seemed like there was only one waitress working the entire floor. I felt bad for her. She was incredibly sweet, though, and tried to keep up with her guests.  The food was amazing. We were given some great homemade bread to start. I ordered the combination kabob. The meat was flavorful and perfectly cooked buttered rice complimented the meal. I hope they give that waitress a little extra help next time ;)",

The fact I didn't have to move a muscle was a big plus, lol.  I ordered the combo platter that comes with chicken and beef kabob, french fries, pita, onions, roasted tomato, and salad. The delivery was quick and my order came as requested. The portion size was reasonable for the price, and they also packed utensils and condiments.  However, it wasn't a great meal. They put everything in a Styrofoam box, so the french fries were completely soggy (I wish more restaurants would use paper bags for fried foods that allows foods to stay crispy). The beef was over cooked to well done (site says they do medium well).   Flavors were good, but overall I would say it is just average. I was hoping for a more exceptional meal.",

The chicken soup looked like it was made with frozen vegetables, was all dark meat, and was a bit bland. The rice lacked texture. The only thing that was edible was the pita bread but it was not even made in the restaurant.   The place is s bit depressing looking which is why i only get takeout.

Ordered food for 7 people - took 1 1/2 hours to deliver, called restaurant to complain and woman on the phone was rude.  Driver showed up and was also rude.  They got one order wrong and they didn't deliver two orders.  Emailed Grub Hub and the restaurant only offered a 10% discount, forcing me to call American Express and dispute the charge.    I would NOT recommend EVER ordering from this restaurant!",

Best choice for food in months.  Got the chicken kabob with rice, fresh salad and grilled veggies and my friend got the hummus, extra pita and chicken wrap --- insane how great the kabob was dipped in cucumber yogurt, hummus was fresh and flavor was great. Portions are large, food is filling and you get that 'healthy' feel only great food gives you.  One co-worker tried a piece, immediately cancelled his dinner plans and stayed late to get an order -- this is the only places in years I stopped eating just to share the food with others because I found it so good.  I really like this joint and heartily recommend it.   The only ding I can place against Maza is it isn't magically appearing right now in front of me.",

    "text": "I had the best hour of my life, outside of worship, here. I rarely have a nice dining experience due to frequenting restaurants located inside casinos. Or perhaps, the food is amazing, but, the location is humble. Nothing wrong with either, but, I was able to focus on my experience without putting money into slot machines or hearing the cook help his daughter with math.   I ordered a Turkish coffee, hummus, the lamb chops, and their baklava.   My nice waiter, I saw his name on the receipt, sorry I forgot his name. Brought me the coffee in what has to be the most regal cup I have ever used. He warned me that I would not be able to sleep tonight; and to just go clubbing. lol. It was very strong, no sweetness, but, fragrant and clean in taste. Not like any espresso or Cuban coffee I have had before.   When my dear friend came back and asked my opinion on the coffee, he asked me if I would also like bread and butter. He returned with my hummus and a basket full of warm bread. At this point, I decided to use my best dinner manners as it was obvious that Maza is a restaurant above the rest. The hummus was okay at first, but, as it came to room temperature it released a floral of flavors that were complementary to the artisanal bread. My waiter brought me a tasty salad too. I may have gotten the name wrong, I'm somewhat deaf. It was very refreshing, but, a bit too much vinegar for my taste.   I am not kidding, I was going over my review in my mind as I was digging into the hummus when my lamb chops arrived. The grilled aroma hit me like a burnt offering of ancient times. Oh my goodness! I was having a meal prepared by father Abraham for G d himself. Was I at the wrong table?  The lamb chops were tenderlicious and full of flavor. It came with the most delicious rice, yeah, better than mom's rice. Thinly sliced red onion was served as garnish; I passed as they were a little too strong. They also provide a sauce for the meat. It was interesting and almost from a ketchup base. I used it with the bread as the lamb chops were $$$ perfectly cooked lamb chops. (Minus the extensive wine list restaurant) What a treat!  Can this get any better? F yeah! The baklava was incredible at which point I had to leave and start writing my review. Mom joining the choir was the best thing ever for me. Thank goodness, her practice takes place a block from here. Yay me!",

Another couple arrives (after we placed our order) and gives their order to the waitress. There is only one other table in the restaurant. Several minutes later, the couple that came after us gets their food. We are just sitting at looking at the waitress and she doesn't even pay attention to us. Finally after 5 minutes she walks over and we ask what happened with our food? She says she will check and comes back to say there was a mix up in the kitchen and our food will be out soon.   In short, we waited about 40 minutes to get our food. No apologies/nothing done to make it right. So while the food was good, service matters a great deal and we won't be back.",

It was the highlight of the meal.   The next best dish was an appetizer, the falafel. All too many times, falafel is over seasoned with salt, leaving me crave glasses of water for hours later after the meal. This wasn't too bad, and it was served with fresh tasting hummus. To me, this would be an appetizer I'd love to have the next time I visit.  The third dish was something I haven't had before, the Pida, a flat bread with mozzarella, although there are other topping options. I liked the taste of the freshness of the cheese and the drizzle of olive oil.  The side salad was interesting. Having the familiar ingredients that I've had at other Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurants like cucumber, tomato, and vinegar, it was also sprinkled with a spice mix similar to Tajin... Maybe it's just something new to me, but it's not something driving the meal.  I would certainly have the beef, again, the chicken was good, but not the highlight. I'd love to see how the lamb is prepared!",

I didn't like the soup but loved the Mediterranean salad. The chicken Adana kebab was flavorful but not as soft as I remember. The bread was not fresh today although it was alright. The kebab beyti was a nice change but the beef is a little gamey.  I would like to make one suggestion besides the food: please don't use stained or cracked plates. Today we had to change several as they appeared worn. I hope the restaurant makes these improvements as I love their place.",

The owner himself goes around asking customers how was their food and if they are b I guess taken care of.  So it's has a mix of good and bad.   If you don't mind waiting then one visit is a must.",

The Hummus, Falafal and Baba Ganoush (the kind w/yogurt) were all quite tasty. We both had the beef kabob which was cooked to order, flavorful and quite tender (no gristle), and the rice pilaf had a a subtle yet quite buttery flavor.  The service was good (nothing to complain about), food was great - 4.6 Stars for what it is.

Since we were traveling, we figured why not try something different. Well, we got way more than we bargained for. We have the maza sampler to start which was stuffed grape leaves, hummus, a cucumber dill yougurt dip, and babaganoush (sp). It was served with a basket of fresh soft pita bread. These all had great flavor and textures to them. I ordered the chicken kabob and he got the sampler kabob. Both were large portions and came with pita bread and rice pilaf. Then our meal was rounded out with baklava and the offer of Turkish tea. We declined the tea and put our leftovers into a box for later. I almost forgot that we were also given a salad at the beginning of the meal. So, if you're really hungry or looking for some good fresh cooked food. This is the place to go. Reasonable prices and good friendly service.",

The hummus was nothing special and the Mediterranean salad was alright. The salmon was fantastic though. Blackened the way I like it. My brother was upset with his pasta because it had red pepper flakes which was not stated on the menu (maybe it was and we don't remember though) it also had literally two slices of mushroom. It shouldn't be called the chicken and mushroom pasta if there are barely going to be any mushrooms in it. My salad also was missing the kalamata olives it was stated to have come with. The service was really just blah. The waitress was nice enough but she brought me the wrong iced tea (raspberry) at first and also my salad came out about 5 minutes after my brother's food. Which doesn't sound like a long time but it is when the person is waiting for you to get your food and there's is getting cold. The last thing was there was no one on the floor for periods of time. There should always be someone watching the dining room. Definitely never coming back here.",

My boyfriend and I ordered Esme, Lebni, and Hummus to share and we loved everything. The server/hostess/superwoman was very nice to let us try Ikra (eggplant dip) and it was so good. For the entrees, we both got the combo kabob platter which was perfectly marinated and the meats were so tender and juicy and the vermicelli rice that came with it was delicious, as well (salad was okay). The food overall felt authentic. I usually don't care enough about places to write reviews because A) I am selfish and just care about putting food in my mouth and B) most places are MEH. But this place has only been open for two weeks and I am so glad that it did and hope it gets busy and stays open!",

The last time they delivered to us, they said we aren't within the delivery range and took it upon themselves to charge an extra $2 after telling us the delivery fee was only $3. Mind you, they have delivered to our office many times before. I'm so disappointed in the last 2 times ordering from them that I'm going to consider anywhere else before them in the future.",

That is just pure laziness and expecting a customer who ordered out not to notice? There was no gouda or english cheddar and it was filled with green onion and what looked like parsley... That is NOT what is listed on your menu. The chicken kabob was ok, but they served it with rice instead of the fries I asked for. And it is not really a kabob, it is more like ground chicken mashed into the shape of a kabob. I was excited to try their cuisine, but I should have known what to expect after reading all the other bad reviews. If you are going to try this place I suggest trying dine in, maybe the service and food will be better?   It tasted all right, but if you can not get one simple order for one person right, then you must not be very organized.",

I declined the Jasmine rice or french fry options so Lilly offered to make mine double-salads (ie  more salad in lieu of the rice/fries), which was perfect.  I enjoyed the salads and the chicken kebab portion was good.  I loved the beef & lamb kebab portions and the lamb chops.  I don't know how those meats were so tender (via food supplier and/or cooking methods) and they were delicious.   - Lilly kept my ice water (free) and Diet Coke ($2 and free refills) topped off and checked on me even when two lunch parties (a couple and a group of 5) arrived to the restaurant.  Place was empty when I first got there at noon, but they had tons of reservations for that night. - Place is nice, wood(looking) flooring, table linen, cool table lighting mini-chandeliers(?), etc.  Bonus: at the end of my meal I got a free cup of Turkish hot tea.  Unsweetened, exactly the way I like my tea. - Looking forward to coming back.",

They even had chicken fingers and chicken wings for those that aren't to into Mediterranean foods or kids.

    "text": "When it comes to chicken kabob, yes this is as good as it gets!   FYI: My review will solely be based on their kabobs.  For $10 - $13, you'll receive a side salad or fries, rice, meat of your choice, a grilled tomato and pepper, and pita bread. At most Mediterranean restaurants, I'll go with the beef adana (long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled) cause it's the safest and pretty consistent at every restaurant. I don't like to go for the regular kebabs because they're usually dried out or over cooked. Maza is the first to prove my kebab assumption to be wrong.   My first time at Maza, I was on my no carb diet and I wanted to be healthy so I went with the chicken option with no rice and extra salad..a very unexciting meal in my opinion. My friend chose the rice option and I was instantly salivating when they brought it out. They provide a Lebanese style rice with cut bits of vermicelli mixed in - very similar to a rice-a-roni mix. Now as for the chicken, if you know me well, you know that I NEVER order chicken at restaurants because people always like to overcook chicken and dry it out, and I'm not a fan of white meat. However, at Maza I was happily surprised that the chicken is like what Sheila G. said, \"BUTTAH.\" I hate this word but it must also be said, the chicken was sooo MOIST. It's the only thing I order here now. I microwaved the leftovers two days after and you know how sometimes when you microwave meat it just gets tougher cause you're basically cooking it again? NOPE not with this chicken! It stayed tender and just as good as the first night.  I've ordered the lamb kebab, beef, the beef adana, and they're all good as well, however my top choices are the regular lamb and chicken (obviously). The beef wasn't as tender, so if you don't mind gaminess... go for the lamb!  Bonus star: I live near trop and 215 and they were still willing to deliver to me!",

I spent some time in Turkey as well so we were both excited to have Turkish food in Vegas finally....since it's our favorite.  Her boyfriend joined us as a first-timer for this cuisine.  We ordered three entrees, the Manti (Turkish Ravioli), Iskender Kebab and the white beans with meat (forgot the name).  We had lentil soup and the choban salad as appetizers and then for dessert, turkish tea, kunefe and baklava.  Almost all was fantastic; my friends stated that the baklava was the only weak part of the meal.  Her boyfriend loved all the food, even as a first timer and one who grew up with a very American diet.  She stated they plan to come here every week now.  I'll definitely be back as well.  Service was fine; nothing extraordinary and never got a refill on our waters....but the meal was what shined.",

Also the baba ganoush is amazing! There is a dessert that is like a pastry with honey and cheese which comes warm and it's definitely a must try! Otherwise the baklava is always a good choice and made in house! Not to mention the great service! There are great lunch specials and really good Turkish coffee. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful it's like a family owned business. Definitely a hidden gym in Vegas if you're looking for a yummy authentic Mediterranean/Turkish food spot.",

Not only was the service great but the food was OFF THE CHAIN. We ordered the Sarma which was delicious. The chicken shawarma was a medley of flavor (add feta) the veggies crisp, meat seasoned like no other. I can't remember my hubby's order but it was deleicious too. The kids burgers were crazy thick, I kid you not...cooked they were still 1/2 inch thick patty. I will be back ASAP. Probably tonite for shawarma. Don't be like me, passing it daily thinking \"I wonder if they are good?\" They Are!!!!",

Next was the main course of rice, red onion pickles and kabob. The steak and chicken kabobs were cooked perfectly.   Meal ends with hot tea and baklava with pistachios.   There's so much food you'll be sure to take some home. It's quite a feast!   Tip- ask the server politely to make sure the meats aren't overcooked. The second time we came here the meats were slightly overcooked.   This is a family owned restaurant. When we were here they didn't serve alcohol, but call and ask. Perhaps you can byo.   Tonight, there's a singer on stage - lots of dancing and fun Turkish music. It's like a party here tonight!",

    "text": "Last three times I came here I was disappointed so I really don't know why I decided to give it another try, wishful thinking I guess.  The lentil soup was too salty but not so bad. I had the Adana Kebab. It had no flavor, tasted like kofte more than it did kebab. My husband had chicken kebab, didn't have any flavor to it either. They never brought us side salad that we were supposed to get with our meal. We actually ordered coban salad, they never brought that to us either. When I reminded the waitress that we had ordered salad, she offered to bring it but we were almost done with our meal so I didn't want a whole salad. I was still super hungry since the meal wasn't good at all so I asked if she could bring me a small coban salad. She said she can bring a small house salad (that we were supposed to have gotten anyway) The salad she brought tasted like wet lettuce. It was so bad. I asked for some dressing thinking it'll help with the taste, the dressing she brought us was just oil. So, all in all everything we ordered was HORRIBLE. There were only 4 other small tables occupied with 3 waiters/waitresses working so there is NO excuse for the bad service. It's safe to say, I will definitely not be going back. Do yourself a favor and just order some Pizza Hut or something.",

We ordered couple of Combo Kabob & The food was flame burnt to give cooked look but lamb and chicken cube was absolutely not cooked at all in middle.  I prefer my meat medium to medium rare but both chicken and lamb were rushed fast flame broiled (dont know why, most of resturant was empty anyway).  To tip the experience off, they ring \"automatic\" 20% gratuity for a food which we didn't enjoy eating. Mind it, it was party of 2 and never I experience that you get to charge 20% gratuity on 2 people. I know it's groupon and supposed to be saving so shouldn't be big deal to pass it on to them, but tip is prerogative of customer based on service / food & I absolutely dont feel like tipping them 20% for this calibre of food.  I do not recommend this place to anyone; you are better off trying less expensive yet better food option in this cuisine type.",

    "text": "Saturday night and this joint was jumping.  There were three large groups holding forth, several other tables were occupied, and three more tables filled up just after us.  It's a big place, so there were still tables to be had, but the blaring music presented by a guy who was part DJ, part singer, and fully master of none :) added to the frenzy of activity.  The music - some Turkish, some American - was sometimes too loud, but not always.  Hubby went in first, but I lagged behind to take in the cold night air for a bit.  Before I could even open the menu, the waitress came to take our order, and of course I wasn't ready.  She attentively returned a couple more times, and then as soon as we gave our order she said she'd be right back with our salads.  That didn't happen.  We waited and waited while the three tables were served their appetizers (we're not big eaters, so we didn't order appys), then their main courses.    I could have been nursing my glass of wine, but we didn't have any.  Though I had read the Yelp reviews earlier and knew that it was BYOB, I forgot to take a bottle with us, so it was a dry dinner.  I could have been munching on the pita, but we didn't get that until the salads came.  They finally arrived after we asked the waitress to bring them.  In an uncharacteristic move, we both ordered the combo kebab platter, both of which came with salads served before the main course.  That was nice, since it was a larger portion than many Mediterranean places that put it on the plate with the entree.  The light and lemony dressing was nice, not overpoweringly acidic.  What I didn't like was the iceberg lettuce; romaine would have been so much more interesting and tasty.  The kebabs were wonderful.  The chicken was like buttah, so tender and juicy.  My first piece of the beef wasn't as tender, but all the others were, including the lamb.  I liked the interesting touch of the little cup of red salsa (is that the ezme?) served along with the kebabs, which added a little kick, and would have appreciated a small cup of lebni, the strained yogurt that other middle eastern restaurants often include. But that seemed to be available only as an appetizer.  The rice was perfect.  Only the pita was a disappointment, okay when first put on the table, but then dried-out, too chewy, and tasteless.   We took advantage of the Yelp-baklava offer.  While I'm not usually a big lover of baklava, this one was excellent.  And the small cup of Turkish tea we were served at the end was a very nice and welcome touch.   Despite the amount of time we had to wait to fill our stomachs, the food was delicious:  well-prepared, not oversalted, and the portions well-sized.  We will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Sorry read all the reviews and was excited to come here, my husband has years of experience in the food service industry/management. The gentleman that sat us was very polite, he asked if it was our 1st time dining here which we said yes, he said \"it is the best, the rice is the best, you will love it!\" Excited I ordered the lentil soup, the eggplant caviar, and my husband also ordered the cheese platter, ordered Turkish coffee as well & Perrier. Eggplant caviar was delicious! Unfortunately I'm used to my lentil soup w/ lentils, this was served lukewarm & pureed, it was ok, forget the cheese platter it's a few slices of feta cheese & food for a rabbit. I ordered the prime beef kabob which was good but I don't understand why he said the rice was so delicious, it was plain rice, no seasoning, my husband also ordered the beef doner platter which was good but not to die for. So all in all the food was not bad. But we ordered 2 more Turkish coffees a regular Kunefe dessert w/ ice cream, the waitress was in such a hurry she served our coffees first which we like w/ dessert, when we got the kunefe it was burnt at the edges, she forgot our ice cream. The real reason I'm leaving 3 stars was when she returned w/ the ice cream she was busy on the phone, served the ice cream over the railing which is a big no no in the service industry, dropped it & spilled it getting all over on my husband's arm's, quick sorry that was it no warm wash cloth to clean his arm. Then we got the bill and luckily my husband noticed she charged us for a large kunefe on top of what we ordered, her explanation was I knew it was either you or the other table, without bothering to ask as I normally don't go over the check w/ a fine toothed comb. Seriously poor customer service and mediocre food, I would pick Khoury's hands down then this place!",

Menu mentions $7 lunch specials but I did not see any advertised.   Ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich with rice, $10- hostess/server gave me a heads up that the dish \"isn't really a shwarma, it's made in a pan\". Decided to give it a try anyway, and the meat and seasonings are okay but it was served, inexplicably, in a giant hoagie bun. When I am at a Mediterranean restaurant, I expect a sandwich to come on pita or lavash, this bun was way too much bread!  The meat was of okay quality but sandwich was not served with any sort of sauce, just peppers, onions, and tomato, which gave the dish almost a fajita feel. Option of rice or fries for my side, picked the rice, which was warm and soft, but after eating the sandwich breading, I couldn't take any more carbs.  Note that they have discount deals up on Yelp and Groupon, and a Yelp check in offer for a free piece of baklava, which was honored even for my take-out order.",

It's simply the best Mediterranean restaurant I've dined at. Arriving here I was a little disappointed to learn they do not have their liquor license but if we wanted to they said we could get it from a nearby store and they'd be happy to serve it. This was quickly forgotten once the food came out. It was a lot of us and we literally ordered everything on the menu!!! It was so good that it was hours before we were ready to leave.   I highly recommend getting everything!! The next time I'm in Vegas this will be where I'll go. Oh and the pricing is just unbeatable!!",

Their fries are absolutely delicious:  crispy and fresh and well seasoned.  Service has always been consistent. We never had the slow experience that other reviewers mentioned.  Since we discovered this little treasure we eat here once a week. They always serve complimentary Turkish tea after dinner. It is very cute :)",

Our waiter was a tall gentleman who was extremely respectful and kind. We have never had a waiter so considerate and kind.

The falafels were horrible and their tahini sauce is straight out of a can. Nothing authentic about that. The rest of the food we ordered was edible but again nothing special. The worst part of the evening was the service at this place. Our waitress spoke very little English, nothing wrong with that unless they assume a plate of kabob was ordered with a kafta plate. When I kindly said I only ordered a kafta plate, I was scolded by her and the unprofessional manager that is running this place. Never again will I step foot at meza grille. It's advertised under a different light than what it really is. Avoid this place unless you enjoy being talked down to while eating cardboard falafels.",

I was told it would be about 45 min, which usually means an hour, and that's right around the time it came, so no worries there.....however when I go to pay, the price has gone up since I placed the order! Really?! I told the delivery person the price I was quoted, and she said they charged extra because it was further.  Um who does that? Who charges someone without telling them? I expected the first charge, but a second at the door? To a place you've delivered to before? Not to mention that they were the ones that brought the menu to us in the first place?! Yeah, ok....last time.",

We also got one small knafah (dessert) n the lady offered to add kaymak cream n ended up charging us $3 for half a teaspoon of that cream. I mean i would love to tip but don't make me do it! And let me tell you how nasty the bathrooms were i had to hold my pee until we got to our hotel room. The toilets had poo n period all over. I wish i took a picture (ughhh).

This is a great place to eat and the prices were very reasonable. The service was friendly and accommodating and the owner even came by and chatted with us for several minutes. I will definitely be back and will recommend Maza to my friends.",

The food was AMAZING, the portions generous, and the staff were so incredibly friendly. They were swamped and the staff was limited, but they made sure we had what we needed. Will definitely return!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner. The food was really good and Alex was very friendly and nice. We were the only ones in the restaurant when we popped in and we remained the only ones for a decent portion of our time there. We liked that it was quiet and I enjoyed the music they had playing. We had the Falafel, Mediterranean Salad, Hummus, and Grilled Vegetarian Salad. We both really liked that the falafel were warm, and the eggplant spread it sat on was cold. The Mediterranean salad was very good! Unfortunately, our mouths are particularly sensitive to vinegar-y food, so we were not able to fully enjoy it. The grilled vegetarian salad was really good with the pita bread. I didn't have much of the hummus, but we are taking it home, and you simply can't go wrong with hummus.  Alex mentioned to us to check in on yelp to get the free baklava dessert, and it was not a mistake. Absolutely loved it, and ordered a cup of american coffee to go with. Went perfectly together, and was a great end to the dinner.  Unfortunately, there were not many vegetarian options. I would love to come back to see a wider variety for those who do not eat meat.  My boyfriend had some sun shining in his eyes through the window, so he stood up to close the blinds. In doing so, he hit his head on the hanging light. The glass shade ended up popping off and falling to the ground. Thankfully, it didn't break. The servers said it was okay and fixed it. My boyfriend was laughing, but we were both pretty embarrassed. Alex ended up shutting the shade for us, and told us a story about another customer who had an issue with the sunshade as well. I am glad they were understanding. So overall, 4/5 for the friendly and great service, tasty food, and light and quiet atmosphere,  but not very wide variety for vegetarians.",

We had the kabob sampler (chicken, beef and lamb) and the seafood kabob (salmon and shrimp), the chicken was juicy and delicious and the salmon was prepared perfectly. To finish the meal we had cheesecake and rice pudding, the rice pudding is worthy of return trip. Would highly recommend.",

As a visitor I would have to say that The area is not a great location but dont let that stop you, it is worth the drive from the strip! The staff who served us were friendly and the food was very good!",
